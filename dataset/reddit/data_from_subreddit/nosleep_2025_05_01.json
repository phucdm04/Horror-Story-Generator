Most people I knew, beg to differ. My late husband was as close as it would get. And everyone else in our town thought the same. Nobody would dare say a bad word about Edward. He was dignified, kind, patient beyond words. \n\nOfcourse I knew better. My husband was a complicated man. And I loved him regardless. \n\nA few days after his disappearance, he'd been left on my front door. The neighbors found him before I, and his skin had long started to rot. Already dried by the sun, stripped by the rain. Marked by the mud, with the odd maggot burrowing it's way from under his pores.\n\nIt was a sight I grieved. But I still breathed a quivering sigh of relief.\n\nI'm writing this for three reasons. \n\n*1 Because one conscience can only carry so much. I need to share what I know to be true*\n\n*2 He wouldn't want people to remember him this way, and so I must do it*\n\n*3 I need advice*\n\nI'll walk you through the situation I found myself in.\n\nWe fell behind in a lot of modern developments. My town stayed trapped in the early 1900s. To this day, what most of the world would call *'vintage'*, we still consider the newest thing. By choice. Anyone who appreciates the old ways, tends to grow old here. \n\nI'm sure my neighbors would frown apon me having this phone. But... this is the quickest way to get the word out there. \n\nThis place...\n\nIt's beautiful. And Edward melted right in, like the muffled sky in a romanticized portrait. He just belonged. \n\nI remember the day he decided to court me. A perfect gentleman. How we went dancing in the town square, and took carriage rides in the park. We'd sit on his front porch for hours on end, discussing our future- I was 17 at the time. And it was perfect. \n\nHe had a restrained drawl when he spoke. Deep laugh lines that made him look a few years older than he was. And he did look older- despite his otherwise smooth skin and jet black, thick head of hair. \n\nA lovely smile that made most women swoon- along with some men I suspect. \n\n*Then, there was also the few that saw that smile in their nightmares.*\n\nHe never told me, not directly. But he never... hid it either. \n\nThere's no way to sugar coat this.\n\nMy husband was this town's most prolific serial killer. For years...and *years* on end. \n\n*The Whistling Walker*, they called him. Why? Well, the few victims that did escape his grasp, reported being stalked by a whistle. Usually while walking home from who knows where, at late hours of the night.\n\nOr maybe your partner was gone for the night? And you heard that very whistle in the other room. Outside your bedroom door, in your closet. \n\nThat was Edward.\n\nVery, *very* few people lived to tell their tales, those that did, had common details. It was no coincidence. \n\nNow, how do I know? Well, my husband kept journals. The stuff of nightmares, I'd never wish reading them on the worst human being. \n\nBut Edward never hid them, why would he? I'm sure a part of him wanted at least one person to know. \n\nAnd when he realized I was never going to ask him what he'd do on his late nights out- this was the next best thing, I suppose. \n\nI won't scar you with the diary entries. It's truly just all the ramblings of a madman. Trying to understand the human psyche. Wondering why he had no empathy. Wondering if he loved me. Or *anyone* for that matter. If he even *could.*\n\nThere's a passage or two, that I find must be shared. And so I will, because I will not allow it to go unheard. \n\n*She's breathtaking. A woman of many interests. Has been to all walks of life, and carries all that knowledge in her small stature. She's tidy. I noticed a single wrinkle on her shoulder. She moved as if she was self conscious about it. She danced, as rigid as it was. Which was endearing*\n\n*There's plenty of reason why she'll be different. Why she'll get me to feel. To understand the beat of a heart, infatuated by another. She'll capture mine, and she'll keep it for the long haul.*\n\n*For her sake*\n\nHe wasn't a man of many words. But that was much needed context. This is the interesting part, months later- I believe a month or so after our anniversary.\n\n*It's faint but it's there. The bitter whistle of time running dry. Alexandria did all she could do. But I fear there's nothing that can be done at this point. I hear it, in every syllable she says, even in her whispers to me while we're intimate. It's there*\n\n*I feel it scratching at my throat, climbing its way up and out. Forcing me to swallow as hard as I can in my moments of solitude. Buying her the time she needs to eventually decide she prefers to live.*\n\n*I suppose I could tell her. That I'm battling the urge to slit her throat and do unspeakable things to her. But what would that accomplish? I'm quite sure it's not egocentric to assume she'll still love me for a bit too long after leaving me*\n\n*This being inside of me. It can feel when my victims still have their attachments. And will not leave them until they eventually let me go. That same entity puts it's hand on my shoulder, it tells me what to say to win those hearts. And reminds me of how little control I actually have over it*\n\nI knew my husband was no normal man. He seemed too... perfect. Not to me, to everyone else. Nobody could find a single fault. And let me explain what I mean by that. \n\nLittle things, such as Edward telling a lie. A blatant one, as if claiming he attended an event that I knew for a fact he wasn't there for. Such as a town hall meeting, or a neighbors engagement party. As long as he showed that lovely smile, and claimed he was there? Nobody could say otherwise. \n\nEveryone would have memories of him there. And they would somewhat be coherent with what others remember. I never knew how he'd do it- but it never worked on me. \n\nHe tried. *Believe me*. But I could always see passed it. And I assumed that's why he loved me. Now I realize it's what kept me alive in the absence of his love for me. That, and nobody suspects a married man. \n\nI'd accepted that all this dies with him. The heartache, the murder, all of it. But... then the murders continued. \n\nIn the same fashion. Grotesque acts, preluded by a Whistle. \n\nMy husband passed. I know that for certain. I watched his body get lowered. He's gone. So how have his actions lingered on our town? \n\nI had a conversation with Marilyn the other day. She clutched her scarf close to her gown. We were the last two to stroll out of the Sunday service. It was lovely, as always...but had a... tension. As if everyone was waiting for a whistle beneath the band's rising strings. Or interrupting the pastor's words. Turning the silence to absolute chaos. \n\nBut, nothing happened. All the anxious interactions did, was spark my discussion with Marilyn.\n\n\"...it's truely bone chilling\", she'd mutter, her soft voice echoing through the pews. \n\n\"I'm sure it'll pass\", I respond, our steps were small and slow, in no rush to leave the church empty. \n\n\"My dear, are you certain you wouldn't prefer to live with my husband and I? It's simply not safe for you to be living alone. Especially since the whole town *knows* that you're unprotected.\", she mean't well, her tone conveyed a genuine worry that stopped me from getting offended. \n\n\"...what would that town say, knowing that I'm currently living with a married couple?\", I reasoned, \"lest I temp him into sin- that holy man of yours\"\n\nWe chuckled. \n\n\"I'm sure Gregory wouldn't mind the excitement\", she joked back. \n\nOur giggles dying out as we stepped foot on the churches porch. The wood seemed to rasp in the breeze, groaning under the weight of it's own age. The courtyard was littered with people in their Sunday best, disheveled from a well-spent service, and engrossed in pleasant conversations under the evening sun, and bitting breeze. \n\n\"He *has* been more juvenile\", Marilyn commented, a lot more like a thought said outloud, than something meant for my insight. \n\nBut I asked anyway, \"In what way?\"\n\n\"Late nights.\", Marilyn sighed to herself, \"I'd wrongly assumed his post would shame him from this behavior. No such luck.\"\n\n\"He's a priest. Unfortunately they have their reputations\", I said. \n\n\"You always assume you've found the good one. As is our burden as women.\", she muttered with a faint smile. Before adding, \"I suppose we aren't wrong *all* of the time. Edward was certainly one of a kind\"\n\nShe rarely commented on him. I knew she had a great deal of respect for my late husband. I knew if Edward was alive, and had courted her in secret, she would've forsaken Gregory, as well as her friendship with me. Thrown it all to the wolves and ran off.\n\nShe unfortunately, wouldn't have lasted too long, I suspected.\n\n\"Yes...\", I said, \"I was lucky.\"\n\nI waited for a few small breaths before asking, \"How are the wedding preparations going?\"\n\nShe grins at me, her bright red lipstick, perfectly applied- was now showing signs of a whole day spent wearing it. \n\n\"It's... splendid. Really, it is. Marcus is a true gentleman and his family is a delight-\"\n\n\"*And Alexandria?*\", I interrupted. I'm sure it was jarring for her but she responded anyways. \n\n\"It isn't easy, losing a daughter. I'll see her a lot less now. She'll belong to her husband's family.\", Marilyn muttered, \"She does seem excited. She's eager to get to the ceremony. She'd have it tonight if she could\"\n\nI'm not sure how Alexandria survived. But I have my suspicions. \n\nA few days passed. And I had gone over one of the last passages left by Edward. Carelessly scribbled on ripped paper. Torn by the force of his pen alone. \n\n*I did it. I did all that it's asked of me. And now, it's promised me peace. Now, it's promised me a life, with my lovely Sylvia. A life with a heart that beats, a soul that can cling to another. Please... Let it be true*\n\nA few days later, he'd arrive dead. His already decomposing body, cradled in my arms. His lovely Sylvia.\n\nAnd the last person to see him was the bride-to-be. One does not just escape the jaws of death unscathed. She knew something. \n\nShe wasn't particularly frightened either. Not at the sight of me at her front door, just days before her wedding.\n\n\"Goodevening dear, is your mother-\"\n\n\"She's not here. She's returning soon.\", Alexandria interrupted, \"...but I'm certain she's not the reason you're here?\"\n\nAlexandria had pitch black, shoulder length curls. Dark green eyes, with eyelashes that curl and flutter as if ensured of her innocence. Untouched, pale skin. She looked as young as she was, about 21. \n\nI knew immediately why she'd survived. \n\nShe made me a cup of tea, she spoke clearly- not a single mumble or stutter. She would ask me to repeat myself blatantly when she misheard. \n\nI'd had my suspicions of her character. But I'd never spoken to her without Marilyn present. Now, I knew for sure- she was certain. Not at all like Edward interpreted her. And I had a feeling that was on purpose.\n\nI also noticed something- she's pregnant. Just barely noticeable to the trained eye.\n\nWhich would explain why her engagement with the gentleman Marcus is progressing so fast\n\nShe decided to break the silence herself, \"Are you going to ask me about your late husband?\"\n\nShe didn't sound proud. Just, not ashamed of her deeds. And I couldn't find it in me to care eitherway, \"I just need to know what happened\".\n\n\"Would you believe me if I told you?\", she asked.\n\n\"You'd be surprised, dear\", I promised.\n\nShe recounted her last night with him with no hesitation. As if the tale was clawing at her tongue, begging to be spoken. \n\nLike every other time they'd meet. They'd discuss their future. Their life. They did not have the luxury of strolls in the park, fearing the townsfolk might see. And so, they'd leave town all together. \n\nNot many vehicles are made available to the public. Those that were, were intrusted to valuable members of the community. And Edward had such privilege. \n\nThey'd leave town. Forsake everything from our clothes and manner of speak. She said they'd visit music festivals and crude bars. They'd savor everything life had to offer. Outside the confines of the town Edward insisted was the *only* pure place remaining in our broken world.\n\nMy bitterness was swallowed. And I listened on in silence. \n\n\"...he had never attempted anything untoward before. Never suggested much besides the occasional stolen kiss. That night ...was different. He'd never made arrangements for us to sleep there- in the city. This was special\", she said, stirring her own tea with a vacant stare aimed at the fireplace. \n\nShe recalled how the music still echoed in her skull. How the substances they'd no doubt indulged in, finally took hold over her. Just enough to smother the last of her inhibitions. \n\nShe made sure to emphasize how patient we was. Despite his clear need. And I suppose that was in an effort to make me feel better? Still, she detailed every action they did that night. And for a moment, I wondered if they'd be a point to her reminiscing. \n\n\"...It was constant\", she muttered, her tone steadying to a monotonous retelling of events, \"it woke me. I remember the sun was flickering through the curtains, the beds in those cities were made with such care, forcing myself up was harder than usual. But I did.\"\n\nShe takes a small breath, \"It sounded like a train. Wailing in the distance but never growing closer. And I called to him. He didn't respond. And the sound persisted.\"\n\nI watched as she clutched her teacup with a force that might just shatter it. \n\n\"He was knelt in our kitchen. I remember marveling at the beautifully carved countertop. A stove, compact and probably quite efficient. I was excited to make him a meal in that very space.\", she claimed. \n\nShe looked me in the eye, \"he unraveled it. Like a ball of threat. The modernity of it all. The mundane... crept away from the pitch of his whistle. Bare knees on the wooden floors. Hands at his side, as if shackled to the ground. His eyes raised to the ceiling\"\n\nShe chocked it out. But I eventually got the image she was painting me.\n\nHis whistle was as stubborn as he was. Climbing to the pitch of a boiling kettle, bubbling on the stove. His body trembled with the force of his breath. Breath he never dragged back into his poor lungs. \n\nHis lips puckered in a perpetuity. Turing red from the effort, and quivering- straining every muscle on his face.\n\nAlexandria tried to pull him out of this trance like state. She failed. He simply grew louder. Veins protruding on his neck, then his shoulders. His wrists and so on. Every last bit of air being drained. \n\nShe gave up when his lips parted. And the whistle got louder. \n\nHe looked as if he was letting out a gut wrenching scream. But no such sound came out. Just the whistle. Getting louder and louder. Higher and higher.\n\nShould be impossible to make such a sound for this long. And Alexandria wasn't stupid. Her first instinct was to run. She scrambled to her feet. And his head turned just as fast towards her\n\nShe took a step back. Whimpering at the sight of his shrunken eyes. His skin tightening on his skull. His jaw still dropped and his agony seeing no end in sight. \n\nHe crawled. \n\nShe ran. Down the hall, and just before she shut the bedroom door. She caught a glimpse of his sickening form, crawing and reaching it's way over to her. \n\n\"The whistle distorted\", she whispered, wiping away a tear, \"his lips never moved. I'm not sure they *could*. But in the same cadence and tone of the screech. I heard it. A high and frantic mantra, ringing from his throat\"\n\n*I will never die- I will never die- I will never die- I will never die*\n\n\"He curled himself onto the floor. The whistle died and so did he. But his mouth never closed\", she placed her teacup on the table, sniffling softly. \n\n\"And so...when he arrived at my door?\"\n\n\"I fled as soon as I though he was dead... there's nothing I can tell you after that.\", she muttered.\n\n...\n\n\"...do you know what my husband was? Who he was?\", I asked, dreading the answer and ready to leave. \n\n\"I can still hear it. Your husband...\", she takes a breath, \"I am sorry...for... everything\"\n\nI gave her a nod. And I left. \n\nSympathy was a scarce resource- especially from my hardened heart- *especially* towards her. \n\nBut I do. Sympathize with her. If I had known, perhaps I might have warned her sooner.\n\n...\n\nAnd so the murders continued. \n\nAnd I found out a lot more from my husband's journals. Giving myself time to actually look through every page. \n\nAbout a month before his death\n\n*I'm writing later than usual. And I have a feeling this might be a more common occurrence. My lovely Sylvia is asleep by my side. She seems restless. I know she can probably feel what I am. What's inside of me, and can't put her finger on it*\n\n*I wish I could tell her. If only I knew myself. All I know is, I've become the very nightmares I'd feared as a child. I hated my uncles whistle. Whistler, is what my town called him. The Whistling Walker has a better ring to it. The title is not mine. I'm but a vessel. And I'm scared.*\n\n*Sylvia? My lovely. If you're reading this. I've rotted away. Or, I've vanished. These journals are for your eyes and your eyes only. Because to understand this curse is to invite it. So ensure it dies with me.*\n\nDon't worry. I haven't cursed you. I don't believe it works that way. I do believe I have my suspicions as to who this entity has latched on to. And who it's going to afterwards. \n\nIt seems to attach itself to men. To urge them to act on their worst impulses. To earn love from strangers then rip their flesh. For sport? For sustenance? I'm unsure. But it announces it's presence with a whistle. It feeds and feeds, then drains the host of it's last breath once satisfied. It leaves them contorted into a soundless scream. \n\nIt seems to keep to one family at a time. Leaping hosts only once the body can be used to kill. \n\nI'm safe. I don't have relatives. \n\nAlexandria... that poor soul. With... whatever she has in her womb. Just waiting to grow into a killer. Let's hope it's a girl. \n\nUntil then, I paid Marilyn a visit. I helped them prepare for the ceremony. \n\nI met Marcus. His prominent dimples and calm disposition. He was a gentleman. Dancing with her, and absolutely smitten all the while.\n\nDeciding to leave early, I took one last look at Marilyn's family... I wondered if Marcus being welcomed in, changes the curses target. Maybe the dimpled gentleman would whistle next. \n\nBut as I greeted the father of the home, I knew that wasn't the case. \n\n*Gregory*...\n\nWhat a charming smile. \n\nHe graced me with it, joining the festivities. \n\nI wandered my way from the home. Opening my umbrella and strolling in the evening sun. \n\nThis curse is not my burden. And it gave me the mercy of my life once. It had no affect on me- it's lies and trickery, and I'm not interested in uncovering why. I simply wish to grieve the life that was taken from me. \n\nBut I suppose if I was so resolute, I wouldn't be writing this. \n\nPlease consider, if I interfere with this... I will just as easily lose my life. Saving people who wouldn't dare do the same for me. \n\nShould I intervene? Or, should I leave, and hope I'll never hear another whistle for as long as I live?\n\n-Sylvia  "},"3":{"title":"I found six VHS tapes in a house we were filming. Last night, seventh appeared.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kbme50\/i_found_six_vhs_tapes_in_a_house_we_were_filming\/","flair":null,"author":"Northbound88","selftext":"I do audio work for a small production crew—nothing glamorous. I haul gear, run cables, keep batteries charged and boom mics out of frame. I never touch the camera. I don’t want to. I like being behind the scenes, unnoticed, useful. That’s kind of my thing.\n\nLast month, we were filming on a property off Hawthorn Lane. If you’re local, you might know it - dead-end road, thick trees, a house that looked like it had been swallowed and spit out by the woods. We were gonna use it for B-roll mostly: dramatic shots of decay, crumbling staircases, rotting beams. Real atmospheric stuff.\n\nSecond day on site, I was in the attic clearing space when I found an old VCR. Looked like it hadn’t been touched in decades, it was tucked behind some insulation, wedged between two beams like someone didn’t want it found. Next to it was a torn paper bag with six VHS tapes inside. Handwritten dates on white labels. 1996 through 1999.\n\nI should’ve told the team. Should’ve handed it over or dumped it altogether. But there was something about the weight of it - the dust, the smell, the way the bag split in my hands - that made me feel like I was meant to see it. So, I took it home. Hooked up the VCR to my bedroom TV with a bunch of cables I forgot I even had.\n\nI didn’t sleep the night I watched the first tape.\n\nIt started with a man filming the house. The same house we’d been filming in. The wallpaper was different - older, yellowed, peeling like skin. The man, he didn’t speak. Just walked through the rooms until he reached the attic. Then he turned the camera around. He stood in front of it and stared. Still. No blinking. Then he opened his mouth. Not to talk. Just... opened it. Slow, cracking wide enough to make the mic pop. Blood ran from the corners. Something fell out of his mouth—dark, small, it looked like a tooth. The tape ended there.\n\nThe second tape was worse.\n\nBasement footage. Whoever held the camera was breathing hard, whispering something I couldn’t make out. The floor was covered in scratches—deep grooves like something had been dragged, like nails had clawed through the concrete. The camera jolted. There was a figure at the edge of the light—just for a second. Crawling. Like a person, but somehow not like a person. Like a bad imitation. The camera fell and recorded a wooden chair for a split second. Static. Then nothing.\n\nTape three didn’t play. Just a high-pitched tone that made my cat hiss and bolt from the room.\n\nI watched the others slowly, over days.\n\nOne showed people in robes around a table in the woods. They poured something - ash, I think - over what looked like a woman’s body. Her mouth was packed with dirt. \n\nOne of them said, “*Not enough soot. She won’t cross.”* \n\nThen someone laughed.\n\nAnother tape showed someone standing over an open hole in the basement floor. Just raw earth. No ladder, just a single chair in the middle of the room. They dropped something down, the hole it looked like a handful of black hair, and said, \n\n*“Take this and forget her face.”*\n\nThe sixth tape opened on a room I haven’t seen before - long and windowless, bare except for the chair. The same chair from the other tapes. The same woman, now seated and still. Her eyes half-lidded. Breathing, but barely. She said nothing while the camera circled the room. Paned to the walls. There was something scrawled low in the corner, almost out of frame. I rewound. Paused. Rewound again. The words weren’t English. It looked like a faint quote carved into the paint.\n\n***Corpus tuum memoriam portabit.***\n\nI didn’t know what it meant but I said it aloud anyway. Quiet, slow. Just testing the shape of it in my mouth.\n\nI gave tape three another try the day after. It started to play.\n\nThe footage began mid-sentence. There was a man in the attic, older, eyes sunken, mouth full of something dark. He looked straight into the lens. \n\n*“She walks when the tape ends.”* \n\nThen he stepped aside. Revealing the woman. The same woman, again. No ropes. No movement. But her mouth is clean now and she’s smiling.\n\nI boxed them all. Every tape. Unplugged the VCR, wound the cords tight like that would mean something. Left everything in the attic under a sheet, like you can smother a nightmare if you’re quick enough. I didn’t go back up there for days, thinking how I could get them out of the house, how I could destroy them so that nobody finds them like I did.\n\nBut last night when I got home from work, I found a seventh tape lying on my hallway floor. No label. Just a smear of ash across the top edge like someone dragged it through a dead fireplace. The timecode wasn’t blank. It ran backward. I plugged the VCR again and I watched it.\n\nIt started outside - framed through branches, through distance, the way you’d watch prey. The camera was aimed at my house. Not Hawthorn. My actual home. My driveway. My window. The living room light was on. The image was shaky, zoomed in. And through the glass, I could see myself. Same shirt. Same mug. Same slouched posture I never realized I had until I saw it from outside.\n\nI paused the tape and just stared at the TV. I pressed play again.\n\nThe footage jumped. A new angle, still grainy, still handheld—but closer now. Inside. Static swallowed the first few seconds, but when it cleared, I was looking at my own bedroom. At myself. I was asleep. Still. Covered with my blanket. My breathing just barely visible. Then the tape cut to black and ejected itself.\n\nI tried to get rid of the tapes. Burned one. Buried another. Tossed the rest in a locked storage bin. But the next morning, they were all back where I found them. Same stack. Same dust. I told myself maybe I’d imagined taking them out at all.\n\nI don’t know what’s happening. I didn’t steal them. I didn’t break anything. But I think watched them out of order. I rewound what I wasn’t supposed to see. And I said something out loud I didn’t understand.\n\nI’m afraid if I fall asleep again, there’ll be an eighth tape waiting when I wake up."},"4":{"title":"There's something horribly wrong with the whale fall I've been studying...","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kbra0f\/theres_something_horribly_wrong_with_the_whale\/","flair":null,"author":"RooMorgue","selftext":"The sea provides for itself and always has, a system in which the organisms that reside there give back to the biome long after death. This is the very purpose of a whale fall, the phenomenon in which the corpse of said mammal sinks to the bottom of the ocean to provide food for other aquatic creatures throughout the slow process of its decay.\n\r\nAt the beginning of the year I and a team of fellow marine biologists spent the better part of three months studying a whale fall that we’d named Titus, our interest in it being that the carcass had settled in far shallower waters than expected for such an event.\n\r\nThe consensus was that disease had spurred the creature to veer off course from its migratory path where it had eventually died, stranded, yet not alone, resting amongst the many organisms that would make their pilgrimage to feast on its remains.\n\r\nFor the first few weeks of our study this process went as expected, the arrival of various species of sharks, crustaceans, worms, and seals documented by submarine and remote operated vehicle expeditions.\n\r\nIt was only when Titus’ state of decomposition seemed to slow, even to have halted entirely that our team noticed something had changed with the fall.\n\r\nChanged, or had been wrong with it since the beginning, a status so gradually revealed that we were only aware of it when it was too late to extricate ourselves from its grip.\n\r\nThe animals that came to Titus to eat no longer left its side, their mouths joined with it in perpetual union. In spite of this the corpse no longer diminished, appearing much as we’d found it: an open cavern cut in its left side through which the ribcage gleamed, one eye eaten into a mangled pit, the other staring out into the deep as though it were still capable of sight.\n\r\nThis inexplicable stasis fascinated and alarmed us more with each passing day.\n\r\n“It must be some parasite or disease,” my colleague, Demetriou, theorised. \"Whatever killed the whale is causing this new behaviour in the scavengers. They’re not eating the body, only performing a behaviour that resembles it— that’s why there’s less breakdown than we would expect to see after death.”\n\r\nAnother of the team, Reynolds, said, “It’s more than that. The whale’s grown.”\n\r\nThe rest of us laughed, thinking that she must have been working for so long that her eyes had begun to play tricks on her. There’s something hypnotic in the sea, even when you’re on land, merely thinking of it. It’s what drew me to the work to begin with: the fascination of things even experts have only just begun to understand and likely never fully will.\n\r\nYou get caught up in it all sometimes. I know I have, before.\n\r\n“I'm telling you the whale’s grown,” Reynolds insisted. “About a foot in length— not much, but it’s undeniably bigger than it was, and it shouldn’t be. You don’t have to take my word for it; look at our most recent footage and compare it to the first images we took at the start.”\n\r\nShe was right, and how we’d all missed it I can’t properly explain. We’d all put the same amount of time and effort into the study, should have seen the alteration as she did. But then perhaps we had, and had simply not wanted to consider the implications of the fact. The weirdness of it all.\n\r\n“Parasites,” Demetriou said again with satisfaction. “They’re bloating the tissue. Making it look like it’s expanded.”\n\r\nReynolds shook her head.\n\r\n“No. That’s not it. You can see that none of the animals around the whale have died or even lost significant weight, and what little they have shed isn’t from starvation.”\n\r\n“Then what?” I asked.\n\r\nI already knew what she was about to say, but it was so impossible that I didn’t want to voice it myself, to suggest it as a reality.\n\r\n“Titus is feeding on the animals attached to it,” said Reynolds. “Don’t ask me how, but it is.”\n\r\n“It’s not the whale,” Demetriou insisted sharply. “It’s dead. Something inside it is preying on the scavengers, maybe, but why would you think that it’s the whale itself?”\n\r\nThis Reynolds couldn’t answer, but there was a conviction in her eyes I knew could not be argued with.\n\r\n“We’ll send the ROV out there for another tissue sample,” I said. “Then we can analyse it and see what’s changed.”\n\r\nTo prove who’s right, I wanted to say, but didn’t. The other members of the team agreed that this was the best approach, being that it was the least invasive option and safest for all involved.\n\r\nReynolds, however, wasn’t satisfied with the suggestion.\n\r\n“I want to get closer,” she said. “I need to see for myself what’s happening.”\n\r\n“You mean take the submarine out there again?” I asked. “I mean, sure, we can do that eventually, but the ROV will give us a lot more useful data. We can capture one of the smaller specimens feeding on the whale so we can test it for parasites or disease.”\n\r\nDemetriou and Barden were nodding along with this, but Reynolds had turned her head away at an obstinate angle, a muscle in her jaw twitching savagely.\n\r\n“Look,” I said. “Our last expedition was barely two weeks ago. I doubt that anything will have come about since then that’s even visible to the naked eye.”\n\r\nReynolds drummed her right hand on a nearby desk.\n\r\n“We could dive down to it,” she said. “The water is shallow enough.”\n\r\n“Not a good idea,” said Barden. “There are sharks and other predators feeding on the whale that might turn on us if they feel like it. I mean, I’ve dived with sharks before, but it’s not something I’d recommend outright. They’re unpredictable. Besides, we could end up disturbing the other scavengers, disrupting the natural process. It’ll alter our findings.”\n\r\nReynolds got up from her chair and began to pace the laboratory, Barden watching her with a pensive disquiet.\n\r\n“No dive,” I said. “If Demetriou is right then it’s really not safe to get that close to the whale even in protective gear. It’s better to be safe than sorry. You know that.”\n\r\nWatching Reynolds’ stubborn face twist I felt a tug of unease, unable to understand why she was so set on the idea when she knew better.\n\r\n“Fine,” she said. “No dive.”\n\r\nShe went out through the laboratory door, letting it bang shut in the frame behind her.\n\r\nBarden flinched and laughed shakily.\n\r\n“Yikes,” he said. “What’s going on with her?”\n\r\n“She’s obsessed,” said Demetriou, her lip curled. “She’s barely taken a break since we started. Skips meals. Doesn’t sleep. If you ask me it’s not about the work at all.”\n\r\n“What do you mean?” I asked. “You’re thinking mental health stuff? Family issues?”\n\r\nDemetriou shrugged.\n\r\n“I don’t know. But it’s something. The other night she was talking about the whale song we’ve been hearing on our last few trips, saying she thinks it’s connected to the fall. It makes no sense, obviously. You’d better keep an eye on her, Heaney. You know her better than the rest of us.”\n\r\nI sighed, aware of the accusation in Demetriou’s voice. She’s your problem, she meant, not ours.\n\r\n“If there was something wrong then she would have told me,” I said. “Reynolds isn’t really one for keeping secrets. I think it’s just the study, how odd it all is. I can’t blame her for being a bit unsettled. I am, too. If there is an infectious disease or parasite situation going on down there we’ll need outside help.”\n\r\n“She doesn’t think that’s what it is, though,” said Demetriou. “You heard her. She thinks that the whale’s still alive, somehow. You can’t tell me that’s a normal way of thinking.”\n\r\nShe looked at me in an almost suspicious fashion as though she believed that I was implicit in covering up some secret. \n\r\n“I’m sure she’s just tired and a bit paranoid like the rest of us,” I said. “Let’s just leave this for now. We’ll send Mercutio out in the next few days. Is that okay?”\n\r\nMercutio was our ROV, piloted mainly by Demetriou, who had a background in engineering.\n\r\n“Fine by me,” she said, relenting slightly. “But I’m not the problem, remember?”\n\r\nBy midweek we’d set out in RV Sylvia, the team’s research vessel, from which we were to direct Mercutio towards the whale fall. The entire team was restless with nerves and excitement as we always were when on the verge of some discovery.\n\r\nI caught Demetriou casting Reynolds disparaging looks across the control deck and shook my head at her.\n\r\nPrior to setting out on our venture I’d pulled Demetriou aside again.\n\r\n“Behave yourself today. We’ll be recording the expedition, and besides, there will be other crew members aboard to make sure everything runs smoothly. We don’t want to make a bad impression. They already think we’re all going a bit mad cooped up on our own out here in the facility.”\n\r\nDemetriou had snorted at this and shuffled her shoulder out from under my hand.\n\r\n“Say that to Reynolds, not me. She’ll be the one that embarrasses us all. She’s still talking about that insane theory, you know.”\n\r\n“I’ll talk to her,” I said irritably. “But you need to concentrate on your job and not this pointless conflict. You’ve had a problem with Reynolds for months, since before any of this started, and I’m getting sick of it, Rhea. Remember what’s important.”\n\r\nReynolds, for her part, remained quiet as the vessel sailed out from the research centre and lowered Mercutio down into the water. She sat watching the control room monitors as the ROV’s surroundings filled the screen, leaning forwards with her chin on her fist as the dead whale Titus came into view.\n\r\nThe corpse boiled with feasting animals, and more circled at a distance, deciding their place on the body.\n\r\n“I still don’t understand how they don’t starve to death,” said Barden suddenly. “At least some of them should have, you’d think.”\n\r\n“It’s some kind of symbiotic relationship, I’d guess,” said Demetriou, turning Mercutio slightly to the left. “The scavengers will survive until the parasites inside the whale drain them of all nutrition. After that they’ll die, fall away and be replaced by the others attracted to the body. Pretty clever place to hide, if you think about it. Lots of live food around.”\n\r\nDemetriou talked with a brash confidence I didn’t quite believe in. I could see the stiff set of her wiry body, the way her left eyelid had begun to twitch at random intervals. \n\r\nShe was as lost as any of us in all this, but it comforted her to pretend that she knew better, that we were all fools not to understand it as she did.\n\r\nWe all fell silent as we crowded around the monitors, Mercutio’s leisurely approach expanding the image of the whale fall.\n\r\nTitus lay like a drunken giant in that orgy of feasting, the one untouched eye gazing up at the camera as though inviting us to join in that revelry.\n\r\nSome of the smaller animals had begun to look noticeably fragile, and it struck me that in the time we’d taken to prepare for our venture whatever was in the whale had begun to feed with more rapidity than before.\n\r\nReynolds was muttering something I couldn’t quite discern over the chatter of the others in the room.\n\r\n“I’m going to try and get close enough to collect the samples, now,” said Demetriou. “Maybe from two different places: what’s left of the meat still on the ribcage and the areas where the scavengers are swarming now. They might give us different results.”\n\r\nReynolds twitched at this but didn’t speak, and I wondered what she was thinking. Did she really imagine that the whale had materialised this way at the bottom of the ocean, that it was some other entity that merely resembled a whale by chance or cunning evolution? \n\r\nReynolds had always had a fascination with the unexplored quarters of the sea, what lurked in the trenches too far down to probe without diver or vessel being crushed by the incredible pressures of the deep.\n\r\nWhen we had studied as novices together she’d dreamt of stumbling across one of the lurking ancients depicted in sailors’ mythology, the first of the modern world to catch a glimpse of them and thus prove their existence.\n\r\nLikely it was this long-held fantasy that had led her to see Titus as such a creature, if indeed that was her belief. I observed her with a new fascination, trying to interpret her slightest move or expression and never quite understanding what I saw. \n\r\nOn the monitors Mercutio had extended its mechanical arms to gather the first cross-section of meat from the fall. Demetriou narrowed an eye in concentration, withdrawing the manipulator back into the vehicle so as to place the sample into storage.\n\r\nAround it the scavengers stirred, seemingly aware of the interloper.\n\r\n“They’re curious,” said Barden. “That’s something.”\n\r\nWe all knew what he meant, having each had the same unspoken worry that the animals would have no response to stimulus, no more than growths on the flesh. Yet they did not detach themselves from the whale to follow the robot, only watched as it traversed to their side of the body.\n\r\n“Alright,” said Demetriou. “Let’s go again.”\n\r\n“After you do that see if you can pick up one of the crabs,” I suggested. “They’re small enough to transport.”\n\r\nIt was as I said this that a pair of tiger sharks that had been circling the whale turned sharply in towards Mercutio and snapped at it, ripping at the foam on its frame.\n\r\n“Stop moving it,” I said. “They’ll probably lose interest.”\n\r\nDemetriou obeyed, but the sharks persisted, their attacks not the idle interest of animals encountering a foreign object but those with intent to kill.\n\r\n“They’re defending the whale,” said Reynolds suddenly. “They know about us. Titus knows.”\n\r\n“Don’t say that,” said Barden. “That’s ridiculous.”\n\r\nBut I could tell by the way he was tugging the zip of his jacket up and down that he was nervous; his eyes tracked the other animals surrounding the fall as though beginning to interpret their activity as Reynolds did.\n\r\n“Shit,” said Demetriou. “I’d better get Mercutio out of there. We’ll have to come back again another time or we’ll lose what we have already.”\n\r\nI watched tensely as the ROV withdrew from the body of the whale, only one out of three samples collected, its sides buffeted by the attempts of the sharks to tear it to pieces. My gaze was drawn down to the eye of the fallen Titus, the black, alien globe seeming full of a paradoxical vitality, and I shuddered, glancing away from it.\n\r\n“You hear that?” said Reynolds into the quiet.\n\r\n“What’s that?” snapped Demetriou. “I don’t need to be distracted now.”\n\r\nYet I saw her head twitch slightly as if turning her ear to some subtle noise in the air.\n\r\nBarden and Reynolds exchanged looks, and suddenly I saw them united, both in tune to the same sound.\n\r\n“What am I supposed to be listening for?” I asked, but then I heard it too, a faint but definite whale song. \n\r\nEvery face in that room registered a like recognition, and suddenly I realised the danger of it, wondering how we’d all been led so rapidly into aligning ourselves with Reynolds’ frenzy.\n\r\n“Let’s not overthink it,” I said. “It’s the same school of whales we’ve seen in the area for ages. Demetriou? How are we doing?”\n\r\n“We’re almost out,” she said. “Somebody better tell the crew we want to go back to shore.”\n\r\nBarden stood, nearly tripping over his seat.\n\r\n“I will.”\n\r\nHe couldn’t seem to stand looking at the monitors, shielding his eyes with one raised hand as he scurried out of the room. We were all glad when the screens went off except for Reynolds, who went across to the glass and touched it as though she might feel the whale through the surface.\n\r\nDemetriou rounded on me, her expression thunderous.\n\r\n“Don’t,” I mouthed. “Not now.”\n\r\nOnce we were safely back at the facility I whisked Reynolds away and sat her down in one of the offices.\n\r\n“Deanna,” I said. “What’s going on? You’re scaring everyone with all this stuff about Titus. Putting ideas into people’s heads that shouldn’t be there.”\n\r\nShe shrugged, sullen and unmoved.\n\r\n“I think Demetriou’s right,” I went on. “We need to reach out to disease control. There’s something infectious coming off that whale; we’ve all come into contact with samples, the water and the air nearby. We don’t know how it’s transmitted, but something is extremely wrong, but not in the way you think it is. What you’re saying about the whale itself being alive and doing all this— it isn’t possible.”\n\r\n“I wouldn’t say that,” said Reynolds. “We don’t know enough about the sea to know that it isn’t a new organism. Who’s to say that this whale—or this species that looks like one—isn’t mimicking a major food source to call animals to it and provide itself with nutrients?”\n\r\n“There’s not much proof of that yet,” I said. “Though I suppose it’s a possibility. But the way you talk about it all makes it sound like there’s something else you think is happening here. Something, well, I don’t know— irrational, anyway.”\n\r\nReynolds fidgeted.\n\r\n“Not necessarily,” she said. “I’ve had this hunch since all this started— everyone has, they just don’t want to admit it. I think the whale wants things to be part of it for other reasons than eating. Like angler fish fusing during mating to ensure that they can breed when mates are scarce, but rather than breeding the whale wants to expand itself. Just one organism made of many, growing and growing its territory.”\n\r\n“And this is intentional, you think.”\n\r\n“Instinctual, definitely. Intentional, maybe. Whales are intelligent; why couldn’t whatever Titus is be as well?”\n\r\nI closed my eyes, feeling all the sleep I’d lost through the project catching up with me.\n\r\n“I don’t know what’s worse: the thought that the fall knows what it’s doing or that it’s just doing it as a survival mechanism. Not that I even hold with this theory, obviously,” I added rapidly. “I’m more inclined to think Demetriou has it right. Just try not to fixate on this too much or I swear you two will end up killing each other.”\n\r\nI spent the next four days writing reports and drafting up potential messages to send out if the results of some infection were indeed found in the whale’s remains.\n\nIt was the other members of the team that studied the sample we’d brought up from the ocean, scrutinising it under microscopes and carrying out as many tests and examinations as the tiny shred of flesh could endure.\n\r\nAll the while Demetriou and Reynolds argued over their findings as bitterly as past lovers while Barden timidly attempted to mediate. I should have intervened; I don’t know why I didn’t.\n\r\nAfter that last visit to Titus I’d been taken up with a strange lethargic melancholy, prone to spending any breaks from my work on incessant walks along the tattered border of shoreline beyond the facility. There I listened to the song of the whales that seemed always to circle us now, or else to the call of the one we called Titus, if Reynolds was to be believed. \n\r\nI felt a longing for something I couldn’t quite describe, a loneliness that my team no longer satisfied, particularly now that they’d grown close in a way I found myself unable to penetrate. Only when, early one morning, I was roused by Demetriou shaking me in my bed did it occur to me that I’d missed the touch of another’s flesh upon mine, though not in this way, I sensed, but one closer, more intimate than that.\n\r\n“Reynolds and Barden are gone,” said Demetriou. “They’ve taken a boat and some of the diving gear with them. They carried off the sample with them as well.”\n\r\nI slapped at both of my cheeks sharply in an attempt to rouse myself.\n\r\n“What?” I said. “Why on earth would they do that?”\n\r\nDemetriou’s eyes shifted guiltily aside.\n\r\n“There was a fight last night. The same thing we’ve been bickering about for days. The tissue we took from the whale— it’s impossible, but our tests showed that it was from a still living animal. I said that there must be a mistake, and Reynolds shouted that I was lying to myself and that I knew the same things she did.\n\r\nI don’t remember much of what was said after that. We’d been drinking; there was some pushing each other, Barden getting in the middle as usual. But then he was on her side, saying I had to see it all now and that I should stop struggling all the time. He said it very calmly, like he was trying to make me understand, but I was so annoyed that I told him to shut up and went to bed. Then this morning they were both gone. Clearly they’re going to dive to the fall.”\n\r\nHorror clapped my throat shut, and for a second I only looked about me, wondering how I’d let my team slip into chaos within just a handful of days. \n\r\n“Mercutio’s still in repair,” I said. “We’ll have to take the backup ROV out with us. There’s no way we’re going down there ourselves, not even on a sub. I think that’s how this happened. We’ve always gotten too close.” \n\r\nAfter informing the relevant authorities as to what we’d suspected to have happened Demetriou, myself, and a crew of sleepy-eyed and bewildered mariners boarded the RV Sylvia on an emergency expedition.\n\r\nIt was dangerous for us to have taken even this measure, I suspected, but I had to see with my own eyes what had happened to my team. To confirm the theory that had eaten through us all like rot.\n\r\nWe found the boat Reynolds and Barden had stolen floating to the right of the area in which Titus was situated, unmanned and obviously abandoned. The deck was dry, implying that neither member of the team had returned to it even once from their dive.\n\r\n“Idiots,” muttered Demetriou, though she was grey and shaking. “There was no need to sacrifice themselves for this. Just to prove a point.”\n\r\nI placed a hand on her damp shoulder. Her sweat had the same salt scent as the sea.\n\r\n“I don’t think that’s entirely why they did it,” I said. “And I don’t think you do, either. You’ve felt it, haven’t you? Something you can’t explain calling you out here, down there?”\n\r\nDemetriou didn’t reply, only stared at the empty boat drifting beside us.\n\r\n“You have,” I said. “Just like I have. Like they did. You’ve just been trying to ignore it. They couldn’t.”\n\r\nI drew Demetriou away from the water, fearing that one of us would succumb to the same urge to pitch over the side of the vessel that had taken our companions.\n\r\n“Let’s go down to Control,” I said. “Let’s see what’s happened.”\n\r\nI and a few curious members of the crew stood watching tensely as Demetriou sunk the backup ROV into the depths with an uncharacteristic reluctance. The black shape of the whale fall filled the monitors, then gradually the details of its mutilated flesh and those that fed upon it.\n\r\nReynolds and Barden were amongst those animals, their regulators torn free and cast aside so as to sink their teeth into the whale’s hide as best they could. Their limbs kicked lightly at the water, signalling the impossible life that was still in them despite the absence of air left in their lungs.\n\r\n“Mother of Jesus,” said one of the mariners standing behind me. “What the hell is happening?”\n\r\n“Get closer,” I said to Demetriou. “I need to see their faces.”\n\r\nIn silence she obeyed, manoeuvring the ROV until Reynold’s and Barden’s eyes shifted up to the camera in unison, each dull, lacking in their natural character and yet compelled by some reflex of enduring vitality that was perhaps not their own.\n\r\nAs the ROV turned this way then that I saw that the mouths of our lost crew, like those of the scavengers around them, had grown into the flesh on which they feasted, fused with the great whale. All of them one.\n\r\nThe eye of the fallen Titus watched us withdraw, and before the monitors shut off I swear I saw it move.\n\r\nWhat happened after that I can describe only vaguely, being that myself, Demetriou, and the crew of the RV Sylvia were all placed in urgent quarantine by government forces the moment we stepped foot on land.\n\r\nWe were aware of the area being closed off to the public, air and sea crafts of endless variety swarming the waters at a safe distance from the fall.\n\r\nPresumably the whale was contained, and will likely be destroyed when the means of doing so without spreading any hypothetical infection have been determined by the relevant experts.\n\nReynolds and Barden are considered legally dead, a fact one of the doctors on this lonely ward confided in me through pity, I suspect. \n\r\nI don’t believe any of the government scientists understand what we discovered in the ocean, and perhaps only those joined with the whale fall ever could with any true clarity. The experts only know enough of its effects and their contagion to have separated my colleagues and I from one another in a guarded hospital somewhere very far inland, this done to protect, isolate, and most importantly to study us, we few touched by the whale’s influence to have survived.\n\r\nHow long they intend to keep us here I do not know, nor will my keepers tell me. Perhaps when the whale is no more than an account guarded and concealed from public knowledge, having been blown apart by military explosives or brought up to the surface to burn.\n\r\nWhen this occurs I wonder if I will know, if I’ll sense it in the end of my connection with the whale, or if like the aftereffects of illness my experience will go on, my mind and sense of self ever altered by it.\n\r\nI still hear whale song frequently, likely only hallucination, now, and yet it’s real enough to me. I question if the other survivors in their separate rooms hear it as I do, the call to go down to it, summoning the water in my body and the salt in my blood.\n\r\nI don’t know how much longer I could have resisted on the outside even if, like Demetriou, I’d tried. Days, I think, no more.\n\r\nThough I know now what would have become of me once I’d joined with that cult of flesh I still can’t help, in part, but want to meld with the great many that is the whale Titus and its thralls, for in my death—or half-death—life in all its beauty and horrible mystery would have persisted through me.\r\n"},"5":{"title":"We're building an army of monsters to fight something worse.

A rocking chair creaked. Slow. Measured. Familiar. Carol’s lullaby threaded through the silence. Half-hummed. Half-forgotten.\n\nMy stomach dropped. My mouth tasted of apologies.\n\nI tried to fight it—to claw my way back to Chamber 13 but the light was already bending.\n\nThe walls sighed.\n\nAnd I slipped.\n\nNot down—but through.\n\nLike a story falling off its rails. The chamber peeled away. First the walls, then the floor, then suddenly—\n\nI was there again.\n\nA living room drowned in shadow. Moonlight slicing through boarded windows. Dust curling through the beams like cremated pages.\n\nAnd pain.\n\nThe Ma’am yanked my head back like she was opening a puppet’s mouth.\n\n“What did I just tell you, Boy?” she hissed.\n\nI choked down a sob. “Good boys don’t bleed so loud.”\n\n“That's right.”\n\nHer knife returned. Not quick, not clean—but slow and deliberate, like she was signing her name into my spine.\n\nCarol was there, kneeling in front of me. Frail hands wrapped around mine like they were the only thing left holding me together.\n\n“It’s okay,” she whispered. “It’ll be over soon.”\n\nI knew that. \n\nI remembered when Gretchen received her Carving. My older sister. It was among my first memories. \n\nShe'd showed it to me afterwards—etched into her neck like a brand: an inverted A, its legs long and bent like rabbit ears. Two dots in the center. Eyes. The Ma'am's signature. Her proof that neither Gretchen or I had never really been born. Just written.\n\nWe were characters in her private mythology. Tools with just enough soul to suffer, and just enough love to make it hurt.\n\nThe knife flared hot as it broke the skin. The Ma'am's voice was like arsenic. \n\n“You should be proud, Boy. Most of your siblings never made it this far.”\n\nI winced.\n\nTrue. Most didn't—but Gretchin did. \n\nI still remember the night she was exiled.\n\nThe way she screamed.\n\nThe gouges her nails left on the wall as the Ma’am dragged her from the Crooked House and out the Door with a Dozen Locks.\n\n*“Let this be a lesson,*” the Ma’am had told me when she returned, shaking Gretchen's blood from her boots. “*There are no happy endings for disobedient brats.*”\n\nSometimes, at night, I swore I could still hear my sister crying from the Wood. Begging the Hungry Things not to eat her.\n\nI shook the thought from my mind. \n\n“Ma’am?” I whispered. \n\n“Speak, Boy.”\n\n“Our story… it’s about saving people, right?”\n\nThe Ma’am twitched. “My story. Not yours.”\n\nShe yanked my head back, fingers knotting in my hair.\n\n“This world is mine to save. All you are is another weapon to help it along.\"\n\nCarol squeezed my hand, seeing my horror. \"Not weapons. Helpers, dear. And the Ma’am’s so close now—so close to saving everyone. Isn’t that lovely?”\n\nI forced a smile, nodding. “Does that mean we can leave the Crooked House soon?”\n\nI hated it there. \n\n“That depends.\" The Ma’am's nails pierced my scalp—blood trickled, warm and slick. \"Carol hasn’t been terribly cooperative lately. It's slowed my progress *considerably*.”\n\nCarol looked down. Shame wrinkled her face. Her hand drifted to her forearm hiding fresh scars, dried blood, like something had fed on her.\n\n“I’ve just… been tired,” she said quickly. “It’s harder to contribute these days. But I'm trying.\"\n\nI smiled at her. Or at least, tried to. “It’s okay. You’re doing your best, Gran.”\n\nEverything stopped.\n\nThe Ma’am wrenched my head sideways, blade cold against my throat. “What did I say about that word, you bloody brat?”\n\n“I—I’m sorry. It just slipped out, I swear—”\n\n“Mother! Gran!” She said them like curses. “Those words are forbidden in this house.”\n\nHer blade shifted, pointing at Carol like a judge's verdict. “And this crone? She hasn’t earned the right to hear them.”\n\nCarol reached out, trying to defuse the escalating situation. “You’re right—of course you are. The Boy’s just… excited about the Carving, I’m sure.\" She looked at me. \"Isn't that right?\"\n\nI nodded quickly, heart pounding.\n\n\"See? That's all it. It's jumbled his head a bit.\"\n\nThe blade kissed tighter. My blood pattered the floor like rain. *“Then he should unjumble them.”*\n\n“Tell him a story!” Carol shrieked, voice pitched with desperation. \"The Boy loves your stories!\"\n\nThe Ma’am paused. Her scowl cracked—reshaping itself into a sneer. “Is that so? You should’ve said so sooner, Boy. I’m always happy to share my genius with those who need it. What story would you like to hear?\"\n\n“Tell him about the Red Queen,” Carol offered. “And how she’s going to save us.”\n\n“Yes,” the Ma’am breathed. “My magnum opus.\"\n\nI gulped, shifting uneasily beneath the blade. \"What's her story about?\"\n\n\"Revenge,\" the Ma'am said simply. \"Once the Queen arrives, the Hungry Things will submit to my narrative completely. We’ll leash them. Weaponize them. And then—then we’ll topple the monster that took everything from me.”\n\n“You mean the Boogeyman?” I whispered.\n\nIt was the story Carol told me most nights. Our family's legacy. The Boogeyman wasn’t just another monster, he was the worst creature to ever exist. The thing that haunted people’s dreams and turned them into shadows. \n\n“That’s right,” Carol whispered, her smile trembling like a candle flame. \"The Boogeyman is—\"\n\n“It is not right!” the Ma’am snapped.\n\nCarol recoiled.\n\n“The Boogeyman is a footnote, you daft crone. A distraction. The real enemy is the Disorder.” The Ma’am’s voice grew venomous. “They took everything from me. My soldiers. My dreams. My legacy. But with the Red Queen leading the charge, I’ll take it all back—and write a lullaby with their screams.”\n\nMy throat burned, voice trembling. “And... And then we’ll stop the Boogeyman?”\n\nThe knife returned. So did the pain. \"Certainly. We'll stop the Boogeyman, along with anything else foolish enough to interfere with my narrative. This is my story, Boy. And evil has no place in it—not while I hold the pen.\"\n\nShe pressed the blade harder. “Now sit still. You’re getting blood all over my hands.”\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAnd then—\n\nThe world reversed.\n\nShadows peeled backward. Walls liquefied into stone.\n\nThe Crooked House was gone.\n\nI was back in Chamber 13, sitting beneath a lonely lightbulb dangling from a cracked ceiling.\n\nTen minutes had vanished.\n\nThe room had changed during my reverie. A new page sat in the typewriter now. Crisp. Waiting. Like it had crawled out of the machine itself. Its words were written in scarlet ink. \n\nThe page was brittle, blackened at the corners, curling inward like it had clawed its way out of a fire that burned a hundred years too long. It smelled of damp earth. Of rot. Of stories buried too deep to forget.\n\nA date in the margin read October 4th, 1857.\n\nSo it was old. Too old to be here. \n\nIt looked like a journal entry, or something wearing the skin of one.\n\nI hesitated.\n\nDidn’t want to read it.\n\nDidn’t want to know.\n\nBut I had ten minutes before my guts were hung like party streamers, and when those are the stakes, ignorance feels more like a noose than a mercy. So I sat. Let the chair embrace me like an open grave.\n\nAnd I read.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n***October 4th, 1857***\n\n*There was no place for a girl to grow in our home—only to wilt.*\n\n*Father drank with the conviction of a preacher at judgment and struck with the same grim determination. He claimed it was for the salvation of my soul, though I suspect he took more pleasure in the punishment than in any promise of heaven.*\n\n*Mother had only just returned from the asylum, her words no longer arranged in sentences but scattered like broken glass across a marble floor—half-thoughts and murmurs, delicate as rain on a coffin lid.*\n\n*We had so little. With Father’s meager wages and growing bitterness, he sold what remained of value in our home. And when he made to pawn Mother’s old typewriter—the last relic of the woman she once was—I clung to it with a desperation I can scarcely describe. I pleaded. I wept. For it was not merely a machine, but a memory of her better self, the one who once wrote me fables and cast me as their heroine.*\n\n*He relented in the way men do when tired of the noise women make. Gave me six months, he said—six months to prove I could sell a story and earn my keep. After that, he would sell it for bread and forget it had ever belonged to anyone but him.*\n\n*But writing is no easy feat, nor is the telling of stories as simple as reading them. I attempted first a tale of a brave knight who slew dragons and rescued maidens, but I found myself unable to finish it. My thoughts recoiled from steel and blood, for such things reminded me too much of home.*\n\n*Instead, I wrote of a gentle creature—a hare, dressed in a buttoned coat, who bore neither sword nor shield, but a soft heart and kind eyes. He was not made for battles, nor for happy endings, but for companionship. He, like me, was too sorrowful to believe in conclusions wrapped in ribbon.*\n\n*When the tale was finished, I ran to show Mother. I remember reading aloud the opening lines, standing beside her while she sat at the kitchen table, dealing cards into neat piles as though playing against time itself. She neither stirred nor spoke, but hummed softly, her attention fixed on ghosts I could not see.*\n\n*So I brought the pages to the brook at the edge of our land, and read them aloud to the hush between the trees and the water. It seemed a fitting thing—to give my words to the wind, if not to the woman who’d taught me stories once mattered.*\n\n*And it was there, just beyond the edge of sound, that I first glimpsed him.*\n\n*He stood across the water, half-shrouded by the alder trees—tall, hunched, with limbs that did not move as limbs ought to. He was a creature drawn from memory’s edge, more dream than flesh, his fur peeling in patches at the shoulder and a top hat slouched forward to veil his eyes.*\n\n*He raised a hand in greeting. Slowly. Uncertainly. As though unsure whether I was real, or whether he was.*\n\n*I asked who he was—though I no longer remember whether I spoke the question aloud or simply felt it pass between us in that breathless space. He replied, in a voice made of wind and apology, that I might call him Hare, if it pleased me.*\n\n*And when he asked my name, I told him I was Alice, and that I had written him into being.*\n\n*He reached across the stream and touched the bruise that still ached on my cheek. He asked, gently, why someone who could conjure wonders looked so sorrowful.*\n\n*I confessed, in the way children confess—not in words, but in quiet eyes and trembling shoulders—that sadness seemed to find its way into girls like me.* \n\n*He studied me for a moment, then said something that has never quite left me. That I was the brightest thing he had ever seen, but confused—scrambled, like light through puzzle-glass. He spoke of a place called Wonderland, and how it might help mend me.*\n\n*When I asked what Wonderland was, he offered me his hand.*\n\n*And I, foolish with hope, took it.*\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe last line had barely cooled on the page when I heard it.\n\nA breath. Soft. Measured.\n\nBehind me.\n\nI froze.\n\nDidn’t look. Didn’t breathe.\n\nBecause I *knew*—the way animals know lightning is coming—that if I turned around too fast, I might catch something still finishing the act of pretending it wasn’t there.\n\nBut nothing moved.\n\nNo footsteps. No shadows. Just stillness.\n\nJust the stone walls of Chamber 13. Empty. Waiting.\n\nI exhaled—and that’s when the typewriter clicked.\n\nA fresh sheet. Same yellowed paper. Same scorched corners. A new date in the corner: **October 7th, 1857.**\n\nMy stomach tightened.\n\nSomeone—or *something*—was still writing.\n\nStill telling this story.\n\nAnd I had a bad feeling it wouldn’t have a happy ending. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**October 7th, 1857**\n\n*The Hare led me beneath the veil of trees, and as we walked, the world began to unravel.*\n\n*The forest twisted around us like thread unwinding from a forgotten spool. Trees became ribbons of shade, the sky deepened into a blue too vast for human naming, and mushrooms bloomed with thrones where toadstools had once been. I recall caterpillars reclining upon branches and blowing riddles into the air through pipes of porcelain. Lights shimmered where no lanterns burned, and shadows gathered in shapes I dared not follow.*\n\n*It was Wonderland, or so he said—and I believed him. For in that strange and splendid place, I was no longer small. I was no longer unloved. I was not a child to be struck or shushed. I was something else entirely: a dreamer given dominion.*\n\n*I danced, barefoot and laughing, across petal-strewn paths and told him—perhaps even promised—that I should never wish to leave again. But his smile faltered at that. He plucked at the fur upon his collar and would not meet my eye. When I asked why, he told me the world was broken in ways Wonderland could not repair, and that no one stayed forever. Not really. Not even those who wished to.*\n\n*He spoke then of a terrible thing. A Boogeyman, he called it, though the name felt too childish for what he described—a vast, twisted sleeper beyond the stars, whose breath could extinguish joy and whose dreams could drown whole worlds in silence. He said that when it woke, all wonder would be devoured, and we would be left with nothing but sorrow.*\n\n*I told him—perhaps a little foolishly, as children often do—that I would stop it. That we must stop it. But the Hare only shook his head. He said the Boogeyman was too old, too immense. That to face such a thing, we would need something equally terrible.*\n\n*It brought to mind my mother’s cards—her endless games of solitaire, played long into the night as though she might stack her sorrows into some semblance of peace. There was a strange sort of grace in it, I thought. The quiet rhythm of turning cards, the patient pursuit of order from chaos.*\n\n*And I began to wonder whether I, too, might arrange such order. Not with kings and queens, but with creatures of my own invention—monsters born not of malice, but of meaning. A deck of dread things, each tailored to face the horrors I could not name, shaped with care to balance the scales.*\n\n*And at the heart of it—at the center of that imagined deck—there would be a card the Boogeyman itself might fear. Not a knight, nor a queen, nor even a joker. But something wholly my own.*\n\n*An Ace of Alice.*\n\n*Yet while I dreamed of monsters and meanings, the hours slipped away unnoticed. The moon, peeking through passing clouds, blinked once more—and the weight of the world returned to my shoulders. I said I must go. Father would be waiting.* \n\n*The Hare seemed sorrowful, but understanding. He asked, in his gentle way, whether I might write him a companion—someone to stay with him while I was gone. Not a girl, like myself, but a rougher sort. A boy with dirt under his nails and a house in the woods. Someone who could build things. Protect things.*\n\n*I told him I would try.*\n\n*And then I ran—ran back across the twisted threshold of Wonderland and into the woods behind our home, my heart still alight with the promise of something better.*\n\n*But promises are frail things, and joy never lingers where men like my father wait.*\n\n*As I stepped from the trees, Father caught me by the hair and dragged me across the yard like a sack of grain. He was shouting—always shouting—and his breath reeked of rot and liquor. He called me a curse, a mouth he could scarcely feed, and I remember thinking how terribly small the world had become again. Wonderland had vanished, and I was a girl once more.*\n\n*I cried out, not to him, but to the forest behind me. Pleading. Begging. For someone to help. For someone to see.*\n\n*And there—just beyond the edge of night—I saw the Hare.*\n\n*He was watching. His button eyes wide. His ears trembling.*\n\n*But he did not move.*\n\n*He vanished into the thicket, and I was left to the blows that followed—my body battered, my hope thinned to thread, crying out for a friend who would not come.*\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe light in Chamber 13 shifted.\n\nDidn't flicker. Didn't make a sound. Just ...grew dimmer. Like a cloud had passed overhead. Except there were no windows. And there certainly weren't any clouds.\n\nI leaned back in the chair, bones creaking like cold timber. The air felt thicker now, like something had been added to the room while I read.\n\nSomething caught my eye.\n\nA smear. There—on the far wall. Red and smudged. \n\nFresh.\n\nI stood and crossed the room, heart ticking with each step. Whatever this was, it wasn’t ink. It looked more like *blood.* \n\nIt’d been written with a finger. Dragged across the surface in looping cursive:\n\n*“Do you dream of her too?”*\n\nI swallowed. \n\nBehind me, the typewriter *clicked* again. \n\nAnother page was being fed in. The keys moved of their own accord—soft, deliberate, like a child sounding out a sentence. A new date blinked into existence on the upper margin: **October 13th, 1857.**\n\nI looked back at the wall. The writing was gone.\n\nJust me again.\n\nI hope.\n\n**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**\n\n**October 13th, 1857**\n\n*That night, the Hare returned.*\n\n*He knelt beside me at the brook, head bowed, hat in hand. He apologized. Not with the simplicity of words, but with a sorrow that made his form seem smaller than I remembered. He told me he had seen something dreadful in my father’s eyes. Not madness, but possession. A shadow curled too deep to dislodge. A flicker of the very Boogeyman he had warned me of—bleeding into the man who shared my roof.*\n\n*He said he wanted to help me. That he could help me—if only I would make him better.*\n\n*So I did.*\n\n*I sat once more before the typewriter and laid trembling fingers on the keys. I thought of the Hare’s stammer, his gentleness, his failure. I thought of the blood on my tongue and the purple on my skin. I thought of how badly I wished for someone not just to stand beside me—but to strike back in my place.*\n\n*And I rewrote him.*\n\n*Not as he was, but as he should have been.*\n\n*I imagined a creature who stood taller than cruelty, whose voice rang not with hesitance but command. A being whose gentleness had curdled into cunning, whose whimsy was now warpaint. He would wear a hat still, for dignity’s sake. A tall one, stitched and proper. But he would no longer be just the Hare.*\n\n*He would be both Hare and Hatter.*\n\n*And also neither.*\n\n*When I looked up, he was already there. Taller now. Sharper. His coat had grown long and threadbare. His smile no longer trembled—it cut. And though his eyes still held something of the creature I had loved, they burned now with a fever I could not name.*\n\n*He thanked me.*\n\n*And gave me his name.*\n\n*Mister Neither.*\n\n*The next day, he returned to the world with me.*\n\n*We stepped from the trees together, and for the first time, I was not afraid.*\n\n*Father saw us and stormed forward, his face red with fury, voice rising with self-righteous venom. He accused me of wickedness, of abandonment, of spite. He lifted a hand, intending to strike me again.*\n\n*But then he saw Mister Neither.*\n\n*And he faltered.*\n\n*My guardian stepped between us, and in that moment, time seemed to shudder.*\n\n*There are things I shall never be able to write with accuracy, only with ache. What happened next is one of them.*\n\n*Mister Neither fell upon my father—not like a beast, but like a riddle too jagged to solve. He tore, he snarled, he laughed like broken clockwork, and my father screamed—not in rage this time, but in prayer. He called out my name again and again, begging for salvation from the very thing I had imagined into existence.*\n\n*And I wanted to stop it.*\n\n*I think I even tried.*\n\n*But Mister Neither would not listen.*\n\n*When it was done, my father’s heart lay on the grass like a fruit overripe, and my dearest friend wiped the blood from his mouth with the hem of my dress.*\n\n*“There,” he said, with dreadful pride. “Now we can go back to Wonderland.”*\n\n*But I could not go back. Not now. Not with what I had seen.*\n\n*I told him as much. Told him he was worse than anything my father had ever been. That he had twisted my wish for protection into something monstrous. That I missed the Hare, even in his cowardice.*\n\n*He did not argue.*\n\n*He only said that I had made him mean.*\n\n*And then he struck me.*\n\n*Not hard at first. Just enough to shock. Then again. And once more.*\n\n*But on the third, he hesitated.*\n\n*And in that flicker of stillness, I saw something terrible: regret.*\n\n*He pulled his hat low over his face to hide his gaze and backed away.*\n\n*I rose to my feet. My dress was soaked in father’s blood, my lip split, and my soul aching in places I didn’t yet understand.*\n\n*I told him to leave me.*\n\n*Told him I hated him.*\n\n*And I ran.*\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI blinked.\n\nSomething stung behind my eyes, like I’d been crying without knowing it. And there was that feeling again, like insects on skin, like someone sitting behind me. Reading over my shoulder.\n\nSlowly—mechanically—I turned my head.\n\nNothing.\n\nI looked back at the typewriter.\n\nAnother page. No click. No whir. It was just… *there.*\n\nA date in the margin: **November 17th, 1857.**\n\nThis time the page was stained with something—a splotch of scarlet. And a scatter of what might have been tears.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**November 17th, 1857**\n\n*I threw myself before the typewriter like a girl returning to the only savior who had ever answered her prayers.*\n\n*I struck the keys with all the fury of the broken. I wrote not for story, but for salvation. And as I typed, I spoke aloud so Mister Neither would hear every word. So he would know, even as he approached, what fate awaited him.*\n\n*I wrote that Mister Neither—my creation, my protector, my mistake—left Alice and Wonderland alone. Alone. Alone.*\n\n*That he should never be a part of my story ever again.* \n\n*I remember how he howled. How he begged. How his voice cracked in that awful, inhuman way. “We’re supposed to be friends,” he said, though by then, it was far too late for forgiveness. “Please don't abandon me—”*\n\n*But the magic took him.*\n\n*It surged from the machine like smoke and ache, wrapped around him like binding ribbon, and tore him from the world. Back to the forest. Back to the dark. Back to nowhere and less.*\n\n*And when it was done, I collapsed into my mother’s arms.*\n\n*“Oh, Mama,” I whispered. “He’s gone. Father’s gone. I’ve ruined everything with my foolish stories.”*\n\n*But she did not cradle me.*\n\n*She did not even weep.*\n\n*She simply laid down another card in her eternal game of solitaire and said, with a voice soft as powdered dust, “That’s nice. How are your stories coming, dear?”*\n\n*Her emptiness broke me in a way nothing else had. It was worse than a dead father. More terrible than a dreadful Hatter. It was a taunting reminder of my loneliness, that aching void that existed in a heart so vast.*\n\n*The next day, I returned to the brook desperate and weeping. But the threshold was gone.*\n\n*Wonderland would no longer open.*\n\n*So I returned home and brought the typewriter to the kitchen table. Sat beside my mother as she hummed and played, and confessed, with more shame than I had ever known, that the machine was broken. I'd somehow ruined it.* \n\n*She looked up—truly looked, as though surfacing from beneath deep water. Her eyes met mine, and for a moment, I saw her again. The woman who once told stories. The one who had loved me.*\n\n*“It isn’t broken, dear,” she said gently. “It simply needs love, as all stories do.”*\n\n*That word struck something in me. Love. As though it were a spell I had long since forgotten how to cast.*\n\n*I asked what she meant, but she was already drifting—retreating into her cards, into her haze, as though the brief gleam of lucidity had been no more than the sun slipping behind a cloud.*\n\n*And so I sat there, unmoving, as the weight of it all pressed down upon me—silent and infinite, like fresh earth heaped over a coffin. The world itself had grown too large, too cruel. The silence had thickened into something bodily, and the typewriter before me—once my sanctuary, once my sword—lay quiet, cold, and hungering.*\n\n*For I had no love left to give it.*\n\n*All whom I had once entrusted with my heart had wounded me in return.*\n\n*My father, with his fists of scripture.*\n\n*My mother, with her absence and her dreaming.*\n\n*Even the Hare, with his cowardice and stammers.*\n\n*Yet I suspected the machine did not care whom it drank from, so long as the love was real.*\n\n*And so, with hands trembling as though some ghost had passed through me, I reached out and took the only love I still possessed.*\n\n*I guided my mother’s fingers toward the keys—fingers that had once plaited my hair, that had once written fables beneath candlelight—and I asked, in a voice softer than prayer, whether she still loved me as she once had, before madness and melancholy had stolen her gaze.*\n\n*And in that instant—oh, that fleeting, golden instant—she smiled. Truly smiled.*\n\n*Her eyes found mine. Clear. Present. Alive.*\n\n*“Of course,” she whispered, voice barely above breath. “I will love you forever, Alice.”*\n\n*And it was then the machine began to stir.*\n\n*It exhaled with a sound like ancient bellows, a great and slumbering god roused from hibernation. From within its belly unspooled long, glistening tendrils—brass-veined and serpentine—that lashed outward with a hiss of rust and purpose. They curled around my mother’s wrist, and then they sank in.*\n\n*Biting.*\n\n*Chewing.*\n\n*Drinking.*\n\n*I took my place before the machine. The ribbon ran red with her blood, and the keys beneath my fingertips began to pulse with warmth, as though the very veins of the thing had been filled anew. The carriage jolted forward with an eagerness that felt almost reverent—like an altar made ready.*\n\n*My mother groaned. Her spine curled. Her eyes dulled into porcelain.*\n\n*And still, I wrote.*\n\n*I told her thank you, though she could no longer hear. I told her I forgave her—for the nights she did not come, for the cries she did not answer, for the bruise that stayed too long and the lullaby that never came. I told her, too, that this was her fault, though I spoke it gently, for there was no cruelty left in me—only a child's sorrow made old. But I promised her I would make it right. That I would take this grief and shape it into meaning. That I would grant her absolution in the only way I knew how.*\n\n*I would write the ending my story deserved.* \n\n*And I would write it with my mother’s love.*\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI looked away from the journal with trembling fingers. \n\nLove, I thought.\n\nSo that’s what fed the typewriter. That’s what birthed the monsters. Not hatred. Not grief. Not even ink.\n\nBut love—raw, desperate, and unreciprocated.\n\nAlice founded the Order in 1867. Everyone knew that. She went missing in 1902. Nobody knew what happened to her, but most figured she killed herself. \n\nYet her story felt oddly familiar. Like it wasn’t something I’d read—but something I’d *forgotten.*\n\nThe voice. The rhythm. The way her words curled like barbed wire around old wounds. I didn’t recognize them, but something inside me did.\n\nI looked again at the name of her monster.\n\n**Mister Neither.**\n\nThe Hare. The Hatter. A thing written twice, and broken both times.\n\nHe wasn’t just a myth. He was the *origin* of this whole nightmare. The genesis. The cracked foundation.  He was the one Owens must’ve been talking about, the one that made Edwards go paler than a ghost. \n\nThe First Draft.\n\nWhatever he did to Alice—whatever she did to *him*—this is where it all began.\n\nThe Conscripts.\n\nThe Vaults.\n\nThe Order of Alice itself.\n\nMister Neither didn’t just start the story. He was the story. And I was standing in his footnotes.\n\nThe only question now was: Where did he go?\n\nWas he still out there? Grieving a girl who left him behind? Or had he—\n\n**Click.**\n\nThe light overhead hissed. Then burst\\*.\\*\n\nDarkness swallowed the chamber like floodwater.\n\nA high, brittle giggle spilled from the walls. Too bright. Too *young.*\n\nMy chest seized. My wrist beeped.\n\n**\\[00:00\\]**\n\nShit. \n\nTime’s up.\n\nThe typewriter whirred. The journal page was ripped backward into the machine, like it was being devoured. Like it was trying to cover its tracks.\n\n*Shitshitshit.*\n\nEmergency lighting stuttered to life. Sickly. Pale. Wrong. The room bled shadows; long, wet, and twitching.\n\nAnd then—\n\n**“M-Mister Reyes…”**\n\nThe voice was everywhere. Leaking from the walls. The ceiling. Crawling out of my own mind. \n\nMy name.\n\nIt *knew* my name.\n\nSomething moved.\n\nA silhouette spilled across the floor like a spider learning to walk. Limbs too long. Ears drooping like funeral drapes. A grin—wide, crooked—leading the way.\n\nIt rose.\n\nTowering. Splinter-limbed. Dressed in Victorian black, buttoned to the throat like a coffin lid.\n\nIt was him.\n\nAlice's Frankenstein.\n\nHe swayed like a scarecrow hung too long in the wind. His grin twitched upward—too high, too hungry, like a shattered portrait trying to remember how to smile.\n\nHe looked like the painting. The one I touched. The one that bled.\n\nI scrambled back. Slipped.\n\nHe caught me—\n\nSnatched me up by the collar, and I dangled like a doll in a child's grip.\n\nHe settled me into the chair with strange care, like a child putting down a favorite toy they weren’t sure still worked. Emergency lighting sputtered overhead, drowning the chamber in a queasy red blink. Shadows pulsed in rhythm with my heart.\n\nThe creature crouched at the far end of the steel table, motionless—almost reverent. Its slouching top hat veiled its face in darkness, but I saw enough. Tufts of fur were missing from its scalp, ears limp and twitching at its sides like wilting petals.\n\nIt had changed since Alice’s journal. Grown stranger. Meaner.\n\nLess Hare.\n\nMore Hatter.\n\n“I know you,” I said, my voice barely a whisper. “You’re… Mister Neither.”\n\nIt nodded, quick and jittery. “And you’re M-Mister Reyes. So n-n-nice to make your acquaintance.” It reached into its coat pocket, arm vanishing deep past the elbow as ancient trinkets tumbled out—buttons, keys, scraps of burned paper. Too many things for any one coat to hold.\n\n“What are you looking for?” I asked.\n\nIt frowned, eyes hidden behind the brim. “A teacup,” it murmured, like that should’ve been obvious. “What else?”\n\nWith a delighted gasp, it withdrew a cracked piece of china and set it on the table between us like an offering. The porcelain was yellowed, rimmed with filth.\n\n“Right…” I said slowly, hating the way my voice shook. “Can I ask what you’re doing here?”\n\nIt smiled—thin, off-kilter. “At first I didn’t know. I’d been sleeping for s-such a long time. Then I woke up. Or I should say… the typewriter did.”\n\nMy eyes swiveled to the rusted behemoth resting atop the table. \n\n“It likes you, even if it hides it. It hasn’t hummed like that since Ali—” He suddenly clamped a hand to his mouth, wincing as if he’d nearly cursed. Then, more softly said, “Since *she* used it.”He touched my cheek. “You remind me of her, you know? I so adore broken little children. Their shattered hearts. Splintered minds. They make such lo-lovely bedtime stories.” The smile twitched wider. “I like to help them see how their stories end.”\n\nThen its expression stuttered—glitched. Froze. A tremor ran through its frame.\n\nSomething was wrong.\n\nIt yanked down on its tophat, hiding its button eyes. Light flared behind the veil of the fabric, twin glows like distant moons. It started to wheeze. Choke. That whimsical, stammering cadence began to twist, deforming into something dry and mechanical.\n\nIt gripped the brim of its hat like a drowning man clutching a rope. “No,” it rasped. “We agreed. I was to speak to him. You promised—”\n\nIts body lurched. Bones cracked like gunshots.\n\nThe spine surged beneath its suit, bulging like a worm beneath silk. Fabric split at the seams. The frame beneath it grew taller, thicker. Wrong.\n\nAnd still the smile stayed.\n\nBut it wasn’t his anymore.\n\n“You talked to him,” snarled a voice no longer touched by stutter or warmth. “*My turn.”*\n\nI couldn’t move. My heart pounded like it was trying to escape my chest. I recognized this. The split. The sickness. *This was what Alice had seen.*\n\nThe Hare was gone.\n\nOnly the Hatter remained.\n\nIt rose above me in a smooth, nightmarish glide, moonlight-eyes burning through the skin of its hat like searchlights. Its teeth were no longer bucked—they were pointed now. Arrowheads. Fangs. The drooping ears shot upward, rigid as knives.\n\n“Hello,” it said softly. Coldly. “Care for a cup of tea?”\n\nIt set the teacup in front of me with eerie precision. I stared down into it, hands trembling. Not understanding. \n\n“It’s empty,” I croaked.\n\n“Look again.”\n\nIt grabbed a fistful of my hair and slammed my head into the table. Once. Twice. Again. The world became spinning metal and ringing noise. Something hot trickled down my face.\n\nBlood.\n\nTears.\n\nThe Hatter lifted the cup and held it beneath my eye, collecting every drop. Then it dropped it back onto the table with a hollow *clack*.\n\nI blinked blearily at the mix of red and salt, my stomach twisting.\n\n“What… what is this?”\n\nThe smile didn’t change. It didn’t need to.\n\n“Tea,” it said. “To bring you down the rabbit hole.”\n\nI shook my head.\n\n“Drink it all up.\" He hissed, voice dropping to a low growl. \"*Unless you’d like some more*.”\n\nMy fingers closed around the chipped porcelain, hands shaking.\n\nWhat choice did I [have](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCryptid\/comments\/jba8ww\/story_master_list\/)?"},"6":{"title":"I Woke Up with Another Man’s Face","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kbtzsw\/i_woke_up_with_another_mans_face\/","flair":null,"author":"Overall_Gur_7228","selftext":"My name's Rick. Or it used to be. \n\nWhen I woke up one morning, the guy in the mirror wasn’t me.\n\nI’m not talking about a bad hair day or a weird dream. I mean, the face staring back at me was someone else’s. A total stranger.\n\nI stumbled into the bathroom half-asleep, switched on the light and there HE was. About five years older. Short black hair, receding at the temples. Mine was full and dusty brown. A scar on the chin like he’d taken a bottle to the face once. Thick eyebrows. Brown tired eyes. They were supposed to be green.\n\nI touched my own cheek - the mirror guy did the same. I blinked. He blinked.\n\nI pulled open the medicine cabinet, hoping to find something - anything that would explain this. Pills? Booze? Drugs? Nothing but toothpaste and an old bottle of Tylenol.\n\nThe panic started hitting. So I yanked a hoodie over my head, pulling the drawstrings tight until my face was basically a shadow, and tiptoed downstairs.\n\nKelsey, my girlfriend, was still asleep in bed. For a second, I thought about waking her. Telling her everything. But how the hell do you even start that conversation? A lot of guys have woken up looking like shit - hung over from a bender. Shiner from a bar fight. But no boyfriend has ever had to explain wearing another man’s face. \n\nI grabbed my keys instead. Made it halfway across the living room when I heard her scream. \n\n\"Who the hell are you?!\"\n\nI turned and there she was, frozen at the top of the stairs, clutching a blanket to her chest.\n\n\"Kelsey, it's me,\" I said, voice shaking. \"It’s Rick.\"\n\nWrong move.\n\nShe bolted toward the bedroom, shouting about calling the cops. She looked at me like I was some kind of monster. I’ll never forget that look. \n\nI didn’t stick around to see if she made the call. Just jumped into my car and floored it out of the driveway. Charging down the road without thinking, out past the gas stations and boarded-up strip malls.\n\nI pulled into the parking lot of a diner - a 24-hour greasy spoon with flickering neon signs. I needed a place to sit and think. \n\nThe bell above the door jingled as I walked in. A few heads turned, but quickly went back to their coffees and scrambled eggs. I slid into a booth in the back, pressed against the window.\n\nA waitress approached, chewing gum lazily. \"What’ll it be, hon?\"\n\n\"Just coffee,\" I muttered.\n\nShe walked off.\n\nI buried my face in my hands. I needed a plan. I needed answers. Should I check myself into a hospital? Go to the police? Hell, maybe just find a motel and lay low until I figured it out...\n\n\"Hey! There you are!\"\n\nI looked up.\n\nA man was standing at the edge of my booth, grinning ear-to-ear. He was big, beefy, with tattoos running up both arms. His eyes gleamed with something between recognition and excitement.\n\n\"We’ve been looking all over for you, man,\" he said. \"You’re supposed to be at home.\"\n\nI blinked.\n\n\"I... think you have the wrong person,\" I said carefully.\n\nHe laughed. \"C'mon, Alex. You forget your own name now?\"\n\n**Alex.**The word hit me like a slap.\n\n\"Sorry,\" I said. \"I’m a little... out of it.\"\n\nHe clapped me on the back hard enough to rattle my teeth. \"No shit. Come on, let’s get you back. Tara’s worried sick.\"\n\nTara. That name meant nothing to me.\n\nBut right then, I didn’t have any better options. And maybe they would help me figure out what the hell had happened. \n\nHe drove an old Ford pickup, reeking of cigarettes.\n\n\"Been a rough couple of days, huh?\" he said, pulling out of the lot. \"Tara said you stopped taking your meds. Started talking crazy again.\"\n\nI stared at him.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I ventured.\n\nHe shot me a side-eye. \"You know. About being somebody else. Not remembering who you are. All that.\"\n\nMy skin crawled.\n\nI turned to look out the window. The town blurred past - shuttered stores, peeling billboards, cracked sidewalks. It all felt unfamiliar. Like I was dropped in the middle of a movie I hadn’t seen from the start.\n\nWe pulled into a suburban street lined with sagging houses and unkempt lawns. He parked in front of a yellow house with peeling paint and a broken mailbox.\n\n\"You ready?\" he asked.\n\nNo.\n\nBut I nodded anyway.\n\nTara was waiting at the door.\n\nShe was mid-thirties with short blond hair and dark circles under her eyes. She looked at me with a complicated expression: worry, frustration, love.\n\n\"Thank God,\" she said, pulling me into a tight hug.\n\nI stood stiffly, not knowing how to react.\n\nShe pulled back, frowning. \"Are you okay? You look...different.\"\n\nI tried to smile, but it probably looked more like a grimace. \"I’m fine,\" I lied.\n\n\"Let’s get you inside.\"\n\nThe house smelled like stale beer and old laundry. The living room was cluttered with toys -  dolls and action figures scattered across the floor. A little girl peeked around the corner, clutching a teddy bear.\n\n\"Hi, Daddy,\" she whispered.\n\nMy heart cracked.\n\nI didn’t know her. I didn’t know **any of them**.\n\nBut she knew me. Abby I soon found was her name. \n\nMy daughter. \n\n“Hi” I said, as softly as I could and she ran and hugged my leg. \n\nThe next few days were a blur.\n\nTara handed me pills every morning — tiny white ones from a bottle labeled **Haloperidol**.The label said: **Alexander Marshall.**\n\nI swallowed them without arguing.Better to be numb than to feel like I was in the wrong skin.\n\nThe meds dulled [everything.Like](http:\/\/everything.Like) living inside a padded room, watching the world through dirty glass.\n\nBut they didn’t erase my memories.\n\nI still remembered Kelsey.Our first apartment above the bookstore.The way she used to wear my old hoodie on cold mornings.Her laugh when she got nervous.\n\nI remembered being Rick Morrison.\n\nAnd this wasn’t my life.\n\nLate one night, I woke up thirsty, in bed alone, still half-drugged from the pills.\n\nAs I stumbled toward the kitchen, I caught a glimpse of Tara in the living room.\n\nShe was kneeling in front of the coffee table, whispering to something small and dark sitting in the center.\n\nAt first, I thought it was a statue — some ugly figurine about the size of a football, carved like a man with wings folded over his face, mouthless, knees drawn tight to his chest.\n\nTara rocked back and forth, whispering words I couldn’t catch.\n\nI blinked hard, trying to focus.\n\nWhen she saw me, she snapped upright, blocking it from view with her body.\n\n\"You should be sleeping,\" she said sharply.\n\nI mumbled something and stumbled back upstairs.\n\nI told myself it was just grief. Stress. Medication. I told myself I was unreliable, delusional, insane, and had to lean on the people around me to know what was going on.\n\nThen it happened.\n\nI was on the couch when the news came on.\n\n**BREAKING: Car crash off Route 7.**\n\nI barely looked up — until I heard the name.\n\n**Richard Morrison, 32. Found dead at the scene.**\n\nMy chest locked up.\n\nThey showed my face on TV.**My real face.**\n\nFound dead in a ditch outside of town.They said I must’ve lost control, drunk [maybe.No](http:\/\/maybe.No) foul play suspected.\n\nSomething snapped loose inside me.\n\nI waited until Tara and Abby were asleep, stole the keys off the kitchen counter, and drove — headlights off, heart in my throat.\n\nI had to find Kelsey.\n\nHad to make her understand.\n\nI went back to my house, waiting out back in the rain. Kelsey arrived, heading inside.\n\nI didn’t want to break in and scare her again, so I waited until she came out with a cigarette. \n\nShe stood under the awning, shaking from either the cold or from holding it together too long, fumbling with a lighter.\n\n\"Kelsey…\" I said, stepping out from the shadows. \n\nShe jumped, dropping the cigarette. Her eyes went wide — fear, recognition, confusion all smashed together.\n\n\"You again,\" she said, voice trembling. \"Why are you here?\"\n\n\"I know how this sounds,\" I said quickly. \"But you have to believe me. I’m Rick.\"\n\nShe shook her head, backing toward the door. \"No. No, you're — you're sick. You broke into my house. You — you’re crazy.\"\n\nI knew she’d say this and came prepared: \"I know about the quarry,\" I said. \"When you were sixteen. You broke your wrist sneaking in, trying to impress that idiot Jason. You lied and said you slipped on the stairs.\"\n\nShe froze.\n\nI pressed on. \"I know about the birthmark on your hip you hate. I know you hate mint toothpaste and pretended you didn’t because I love it. I even told you not to smoke but know you still do when you’re stressed. Found that pack of cigarettes three months ago, breast pocket of your pea coat with a rip in the lining. But I didn’t tell you.” \n\nTears welled up in her eyes.\n\n\"How?\" she whispered.\n\n\"I have no idea,\" I said. \"I saw the news report - but that was my body but - I’m here. Somehow. This is me.\"\n\nKelsey stood there, rain dripping from her light brown hair, staring at me like she was seeing a ghost.For a long time, neither of us said anything. \n\nFinally, she broke.\n\n\"Get inside,\" she whispered, her voice cracking. \"Before someone sees you.\"\n\nThe house was dim and cold. She didn’t turn on the lights — just closed the door softly behind us and bolted it.\n\nThat night, I crashed on the couch, wrapped in a blanket that smelled faintly of home — detergent and Kelsey’s old perfume.\n\nNeither of us slept much.\n\nShe sat in the armchair across from me, sipping cold coffee. Every few minutes, she’d look at me, studying my face, my gestures, the way I scratched my head or shifted my weight.\n\nLooking for pieces of the man she lost.\n\nLooking for proof.\n\nI didn’t blame her.\n\nSometimes I caught myself doing it too.\n\nTrying to find *myself* in this stranger's skin.\n\nOver the next few days, we started digging.\n\nShe pulled out old photo albums. I pointed out things only Rick would know — places we’d gone, stupid inside jokes scribbled on the back of Polaroids.\n\nWe went through my old texts and emails. Looked for anything about Alex Marshall. Nothing.\n\nNo overlaps. No connections.\n\nOne night we drove out to the crash site, headlights cutting through the misty dark.\n\nRoute 7 was deserted. The road wound between two rocky slopes, guardrails twisted like broken arms.\n\nWe found the spot easily — a fresh patch of scorched earth, scattered glass glittering in the weeds.\n\nThe official story said I veered off, hit the ravine, snapped my neck on impact.\n\nBut standing there, looking down at the wreckage site...it didn’t feel like an accident.\n\nKelsey shivered beside me, pulling her jacket tighter. She had told me that since that morning she first saw me as Alex, the Rick that returned home hadn’t been acting like himself. He claimed he was out on a morning jog when I “intruded,”, but he was cold, distant. Going through the motions. \n\nThen a memory clicked into place - sharp, clear.\n\nOn the way home, I told Kelsey about the figurine.\n\nThe mouthless thing Tara had been whispering to.\n\nThe way she tried to hide it when she realized I was watching.\n\nKelsey went still, her hand tightening around her coffee thermos.\n\n\"Describe it again,\" she said.\n\nI did.\n\nShe searched on her laptop, using my description to find something.\n\nA pagan story older than any religion about a figure called **The Mourn-Kin**. He fit the description of the figurine to a tee. \n\nA being that could swap one life for another.\n\nBut the price was steep:The stolen soul would rot away, memory by memory, until nothing remained. Only the vessel — the body — would survive.\n\nBefore we could scare each other any further, we decided to call it. Kelsey had made up the guest bedroom for me after the first night, but she didn’t want to sleep alone.\n\nI told her I could take the floor and she could have the bed as she shook her head and pulled me in, kissing me. She came away, saying it was the strangest thing - she knew I was physically different, but she could feel me in the kiss. It couldn’t have been anyone else. \n\nWe slept together that night and I felt like I was home again. Even if we had a long way to go. I was overwhelmed with the comforting sensation that we would figure it out together. \n\nThe next morning we were awoken by three loud knocks on the front door. \n\nKelsey sat bolt upright, heart hammering like mine.\n\nA voice called out from the porch.\n\n\"Alex? You need to come home.\"\n\nIt was Tara’s brother, Wesley, the big guy who found me in the diner. \n\nAnd he wasn’t alone.\n\nThrough the blinds, I caught a glimpse of a patrol car.\n\nThe police.\n\nKelsey grabbed my hand, pulling me toward the back of the house.\n\n\"Out the window,\" she hissed.\n\nWe scrambled into the kitchen, wrenching open the tiny window above the sink.I barely fit through, landing hard in the wet grass behind the house.\n\nKelsey tumbled after me.\n\nWe sprinted into the woods, shoes slipping in the mud.\n\nBehind us, I heard the front door crash open, cops bursting inside, then Tara’s voice cutting through the morning air:\n\n*\"It’s too late!\"* she screamed.\n\nI didn’t look back.\n\nWe ran for what felt like hours.\n\nThrough the trees, down abandoned side roads, across parking lots slicked with rain.\n\nFound an old junkyard, busted open a rusted Ford that still had keys tucked behind the visor.\n\nWe drove with the windows down, soaking wet, breathless.\n\nAnd when we thought we were clear, we pulled into a gas station outside of town.\n\nThe lot was empty except for one truck.\n\nWesley's truck.\n\nBy the time we spotted it, he was already standing there, behind my bumper, blocking us into our space. Waiting.\n\nKelsey cursed under her breath, restarting the ignition like she was going to run him over.  \n\nBut in the rearview, Wesley held up one hand.\n\nNot threatening or angry.\n\nJust tired.\n\nI opened my door before she could stop me.Maybe I just needed answers.\n\nOr maybe I was sick of running.\n\nWesley didn’t move, just looked at me,  really looked, and said:\n\n\"I’m not here to drag you back.\"\n\n“Then why are you here?” I asked. \n\n“To let you know.”\n\n“Know what?” I asked.\n\nHe lit a cigarette with shaking fingers, glanced toward the dark highway.\n\n\"You were never supposed to survive it.\"\n\n“What is it, exactly?” I asked.\n\n“I don’t know,” he exhaled a cloud of smoke. “All I know is, it…trades one life for another. First time Tara did it, it was to a bully of hers in high school. Caused so much chaos, I never thought she’d use it again.” \n\n“Then why did she?” I asked.\n\n“Because you…” he paused. “...Alex wasn’t well. He kept talking about leaving Tara. Didn’t want to be with her anymore. And he was threatening to take Abby.” He paused, then said, “Guess she figured she had a better shot at someone else in his body than no Alex altogether.”\n\n“Why did you choose me?” I asked. He smiled and shook his head:  “It chose you. We had nothing to do with it.”\n\nIn a weird way this made sense. I was a perfect stranger. But I still didn’t understand why he was here. “What’s the point of finding me? Telling me all this?” \n\nI could see regret in his eyes. “Because it wasn’t supposed to go down like this. You were supposed to forget right away.”\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"But she didn’t count on you fighting it. On her still loving you. Even as someone else.\"\n\nHe looked toward Kelsey sitting in the car, watching us, terrified.\n\n“You being around her... remembering who you are... that's what’s screwing it all up,” he said.\n\n“It needs you broken. Alone. That’s how it finishes the job. But you — you wouldn’t lay down. You kept fighting.”\n\n“Am I safe now?” I asked earnestly. \n\nHe thought about it. \"You bought time. I don’t know how much. But use it while you can.”\n\nHe dropped the cigarette, grinding it under his boot.\n\n“That’s it?” I said. \n\nHe nodded. \"I’m sorry.\" \n\nThen he got back into his truck and drove away, his taillights shrinking into the dark.\n\nWe fled again, not putting stock in anything he said, knowing it was better to keep running than to let our guard down now.\n\nNew state. New town, New motel. Night after night. I was just glad to have Kelsey with me and she felt the same. We didn’t care where we were as long as we were together. \n\nAnd it felt like maybe we had beaten it…until  little things started slipping.\n\nFirst it was small stuff she had told me. Things I should have remembered. Where we parked the car. What room we were staying in. I brushed these off - everyone forgets sometimes. \n\nThen whole conversations were gone like smoke. I couldn’t remember what we talked about or ate at dinner. Kelsey was concerned, but kept me calm, hoping for the best despite the growing evidence to the contrary. \n\nFinally one night, we stopped at a nameless motel on the edge of town. It was cold. Freezing. \n\nKelsey said she was going back inside to grab her scarf.\n\nI sat on the curb, smoking, watching the stars blink and shimmer in the dark. The kind of dark that illuminated them all but made everything else impossible to discern. \n\nAnd just then, I swear some of the stars seemed to brighten, forming the shape of something – a new constellation I’d never noticed before: a mouthless figure curled in on itself, wings folded across its face, knees drawn tight to its chest.\n\nThe door creaked open behind me.\n\nFootsteps on gravel.\n\nI turned.\n\nThere was a woman standing there.\n\nMid-thirties. Light brown hair. Warm but tired eyes. A scarf dangling from her hand.\n\nI stared at her as she approached, heart pounding for reasons I didn’t understand.\n\n\"Rick?\" she said, voice trembling, giving me a look of concern. \n\nI stared at her for a long moment.\n\nThen I shook my head.\n\n\"Sorry, ma'am,\" I said gently.\"I think you have me mistaken for someone else.\"\n\nHer eyes pleaded with me. \n\nBut I didn’t know what for.\n\nTears welled up and spilled down her cheeks.\n\nI shifted awkwardly, feeling bad.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" I asked.\n\nShe shook her head.No.\n\nI hesitated, the night pressing down around us.\n\n\"Are you here alone?\" I asked gently.\n\nFor a long moment, she just stared at me.Searching for something in my face.Something that wasn’t there anymore.\n\nThen she nodded."},"7":{"title":"I Shouldn’t Have Taken That Shot.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kbclj1\/i_shouldnt_have_taken_that_shot\/","flair":null,"author":"pentyworth223","selftext":"I’ve hunted these woods since I was twelve.\n\nNever had a reason to be scared out here. I know the ridgelines, the streams, the sound deer make when they crunch through the undergrowth. I know how a branch sounds when a squirrel hops across it. I know the silence when something bigger is nearby.\n\nThat silence is what tipped me off.\n\nIt was about an hour before dusk. Cold enough for my breath to hang. I was perched in my tree stand with the crossbow cradled across my lap, waiting on a buck I’d seen on my trail cam the night before—huge thing, with a scar down its neck and antlers like twisted roots.\n\nBut when it stepped into the clearing beneath me, something was off.\n\nIt was limping.\n\nIt moved like it didn’t know how to walk on legs. Kept tilting its head, too—like a dog trying to understand a noise. Then it looked up.\n\nNot at the tree. At me.\n\nIts eyes weren’t right. No reflection, no glint. Just pits. Sunken, too deep, too wide. I should’ve lowered the bow right then and there. Should’ve backed down and climbed out, left the woods and never looked back.\n\nBut I didn’t.\n\nI fired.\n\nThe bolt struck it just under the ribcage. It didn’t bleed.\n\nIt didn’t flinch.\n\nIt just let out this low, wet sound, like air escaping a drowned lung. Then it dropped—legs buckling beneath it in this awkward collapse—and didn’t move.\n\nI waited. Watched. Five minutes passed. Then ten.\n\nNo twitch. No sound. Nothing.\n\nFinally, I climbed down.\n\nIt took everything in me to walk up to that thing. My boots crunched too loud in the dead leaves, my breath too sharp in my ears. The closer I got, the more I realized this wasn’t a deer.\n\nIt looked like one at first. But the proportions were off. Legs too long. Neck too thin. The fur had patches missing—revealing pale, blistered skin beneath. And its hooves… weren’t hooves.\n\nThey were hands.\n\nLong, bony fingers curled under like they’d been broken and reset the wrong way. The flesh between them was webbed.\n\nAnd the antlers? They weren’t antlers.\n\nThey were… bone. Gnarled, branching outward from the skull, yes—but they spiraled inward too, like the thing had been growing inward on itself. They twitched.\n\nI turned and ran.\n\nDidn’t even grab my bow. Just sprinted the three miles back to my truck, got in, locked the doors, and sat there shaking.\n\nI told myself I imagined it. Shock, adrenaline, whatever. I just needed to get home, get warm, and sleep.\n\nBut something followed me.\n\nIt didn’t make sense until I got home and opened the door to my cabin.\n\nEvery light was on\n.\nI live alone.\n\nI slammed the cabin door shut behind me and locked it. Deadbolt. Chain. Even slid the old dresser in front for good measure. I don’t even know why—I live miles from anyone. No one’s out here. No one’s supposed to be.\n\nBut I felt it.\n\nLike something was still behind me.\n\nI kept telling myself I was just shaken. That I’d seen a diseased buck, shot it in poor light, panicked. That none of it was as bad as it seemed. But that didn’t explain the lights being on.\n\nI always shut them off before I leave. Habit. Out here, every bit of electricity counts.\n\nI moved from room to room, checking the doors. Windows. Closets. Shower curtain.\n\nNothing.\n\nNo sign of a break-in. No footprints in the dust near the door. No scuffs on the floor. Just that same weird hum in the back of my skull—like the air was vibrating.\n\nI turned off the lights, one by one. Didn’t want to draw attention to the house. Then I grabbed my rifle and sat on the couch with my back to the wall.\n\nI don’t know when I nodded off, but I woke up cold.\n\nIt was pitch black. I could see my breath. The air felt… wet. Heavy, like I was breathing through a soaked rag. The fire had died to coals, and the windows had frosted over from the inside.\n\nThen I heard it.\n\nKnock.\n\nJust one. Sharp. Low on the wall, maybe six inches off the floor.\n\nI sat up straight, heart jackhammering. Listened.\n\nKnock.\n\nSame spot. Front of the cabin. Just under the living room window.\n\nI turned on my flashlight, swept it across the wall. Nothing.\n\nAnother knock—this time behind me.\n\nI spun around.\n\nKnock knock knock.\n\nLower. Slower. From beneath the floorboards.\n\nI aimed the flashlight down. The floor was just pine planks and dust, but I swear I saw one of them move. Just slightly. Like something pushed up from underneath and the wood bowed, just for a second.\n\nI didn’t breathe.\n\nKnock. Knock. Knock. Knock.\n\nNow at the back of the house. Then the hallway. Then the base of the kitchen sink.\n\nIt was circling. Under me.\n\nAnd then it stopped.\n\nI waited. Minutes passed. No sound. No movement.\n\nI got up, tried to calm myself, and padded toward the hallway.\n\nThat’s when I heard my voice.\n\nNot a voice. My voice.\n\nFrom under the floorboards.\n\nWhispering.\n\nI must’ve passed out again.\n\nWhen I opened my eyes, the sun was bleeding pale light through the frosted windows. My back ached from sleeping on the floor, the rifle still clutched in my hands.\n\nFor a moment, I thought I’d dreamed it all.\n\nThe knocks. The whisper. The voice.\n\nThen I looked at the window.\n\nFour long, vertical scratches carved into the glass from the inside—as if something had been trying to claw its way out.\n\nAnd below them, just visible in the frost on the floorboards, was a handprint.\n\nIt wasn’t human.\n\nToo wide. Too many fingers. The imprint stretched out like something had melted into the wood, leaving behind an oily residue that shimmered faintly in the light.\n\nI reached out. Touched it.\n\nStill damp.\n\nI don’t know what compelled me to lift the edge of the bedspread, but I did.\n\nThere was nothing under the bed.\n\nExcept for another handprint.\n\nAnd a drag mark leading toward the hallway.\n\nThat’s when the air changed again.\n\nStill. Heavy. Like the world was holding its breath.\n\nThen something slammed into the front door.\n\nBOOM.\n\nI jolted, stumbled back into the wall, rifle up.\n\nBOOM.\n\nThe whole frame shook. Dust rained from the ceiling. The chain lock rattled like a scared animal.\n\nThen silence.\n\nI crept toward the door, breath caught in my throat, every step slower than the last.\n\nThe third hit didn’t come like the others.\n\nThis time, it was low. Like something had dropped onto all fours and was pushing its head against the bottom half of the door.\n\nThe wood began to bend inward, creaking under pressure it shouldn’t have been able to take.\n\nI raised the rifle.\n\nSomething spoke through the crack in the door.\n\nNot words. Just… a mimicry of breathing. Like someone trying to sound human. Drawing in air and letting it rattle out again. Wet. Croaking. Like a throat filled with fluid.\n\nThen it laughed.\n\nMy laugh.\n\nPerfectly replicated. Just a little too loud. Just a little too long.\n\nThen came the whisper—again in my voice—from beneath the floor.\n\n“Let me in. I’m cold.”\n\nI backed away, trying not to scream, trying to remember if I left the back door locked, if the windows were shut, if—\n\nThe rifle jammed.\n\nI don’t even remember pulling the trigger. Just the sound of the click and the sickening realization that I’d never cleaned the chamber.\n\nThe door creaked again.\n\nSlow. Splintering.\n\nSomething thin was beginning to poke through the crack where the wood split—not a hand. Not a claw.\n\nSomething bonier. Jointed wrong. Like a centipede made of fingers.\n\nI didn’t waste time trying the rifle again.\n\nInstead, I shoved the couch toward the front door with all the force I had. Threw the kitchen table against it. Dragged the bookcase from the hallway and tipped it over. I even knocked over the coat rack and wedged it under the door handle like some kind of medieval brace.\n\nSomething on the other side scraped along the wood. Slow. Purposeful. Like nails—or teeth.\n\nI backed away and ran to the radio.\n\nIt’s old, military-grade—set to pick up emergency channels. I’d rigged it with a signal booster last winter when the snows had made it impossible to get out for days. It should’ve worked.\n\nI spun the dial. Static.\n\nClicked through the presets. Static.\n\nThen something came through.\n\nNot a voice. Not at first.\n\nBreathing.\n\nThen a rustle. Then my voice—recorded.\n\nBut it was something I’d never said.\n\n“Don’t shoot,” it said in a panicked whisper. “It just wants a way in. Let it in. Let it in.”\n\nI dropped the receiver like it burned me.\n\nAnother station buzzed to life.\n\nIt was me again. Same voice. Same tone.\n\nOnly now I sounded calm. Pleasant.\n\n“I was cold,” I said. “But it’s warm inside. You’ll see.”\n\nI shut the radio off. Yanked the battery out. Threw it across the room.\n\nThe thing at the door didn’t like that.\n\nIt slammed against the frame again, harder this time—splinters rained down from the edges. The couch jolted. The table legs skidded across the floor with a shriek.\n\nI ran to the back door. Still locked.\n\nI pulled a heavy dresser in front of it. Nailed shut the windows I could reach. Taped over the vents. Shut the flue in the chimney and pushed the coffee table against it.\n\nThen I stood in the center of the room, panting, heart thudding in my ears.\n\nThe house went quiet again.\n\nAnd that was worse.\n\nI don’t know how long I stood there. Ten minutes. Maybe an hour.\n\nThen came the tapping.\n\nNot from the door.\n\nFrom the window.\n\nI turned, slow.\n\nSomething was standing just beyond the frost-glazed glass. Thin. Wrong. Its head tilted at an unnatural angle, its too-long limbs twitching at the joints like they didn’t know where to bend.\n\nIt didn’t move.\n\nJust tapped.\n\nOne finger.\n\nThen another.\n\nThen it opened its mouth, wide and wet, and pressed it to the glass.\n\nAnd whispered my name.\n\nI’m posting this now because I don’t know how long the power will stay on. If anyone’s out there—if anyone’s reading this—please send help.\n\nI don’t think it’s trying to kill me.\n\nI think it’s trying to replace me.\n\n\n"},"8":{"title":"Does anyone remember www.deadlinks.com?

My heart pounding against my ribs, my skin clammy with cold sweat.\n\nI wasn’t in my room.\n\nBlinding fluorescent lights buzzed overhead. The air smelled clinical—like antiseptic and metal. I sat up slowly, my muscles aching, my head heavy with disorientation. The room was small and uncomfortably bare. There was nothing but the stiff, narrow bed I had woken up on and a stainless steel toilet bolted to the corner—something straight out of a prison cell. Panic crept up my throat as I tried to piece together how I had gotten here. The last thing I remembered was—\n\nThe thing at my door.\n\nBut everything after that? \n\nBlank.\n\nI forced myself to stand, my legs trembling beneath me as I staggered toward the only door in the room. There was no handle. I pressed my hands against the cold metal, pushing. It didn’t even budge. I started pounding but there was no response.\n\nI was trapped.\n\nWith no other option, I sat back down on the bed, staring at the door, waiting. Hoping someone would open it. \n\nMy sense of time had rotted away. \n\nMinutes bled into hours, hours into days, all devoured by the unrelenting hum of the white fluorescent light. It never flickered, never dimmed, just hung above me like a sterile sun, stretching time into something shapeless. Every time I slept it felt like a new day when I woke up. I eventually stopped trying to keep time. One day the door creaked open. \"Finally! I can get out of here,\" I thought.\n\nTwo figures stood in the doorway.\n\nTheir masks—porcelain-white with gold trim—had no eye holes, just smooth, empty faces. Long, hooded red cloaks swallowed their bodies, the same gold trim tracing their edges like veins.\n\n\"Am I finally being let out?\" My voice came out hoarse, unused.\n\nNo response.\n\nOne of them stepped forward, the air shifting as it moved, like the temperature dropped a few degrees. I swallowed. \"Are you gonna let me out of this place?\"\n\n…\n\nBefore I could react, cold metal snapped around my neck—a collar, thick and unyielding. A leash made of chains trailed from it, disappearing into the folds of the figure’s cloak. My hands shot up instinctively to rip it off—\n\nAgony.\n\nTiny, razor-sharp needles shot out of the collar, impaling every finger that touched it. I gasped, yanking my hands away. Blood dripped from my fingertips onto the pristine white floor, spreading in small, violent blooms. The figure yanked the leash forward, nearly pulling me off my feet. I staggered after them, the second figure following close behind.\n\nThe hallway stretched endlessly before me, identical white walls and white doors swallowing all sense of direction. The only thing breaking the monotony were the small chutes on each door—food slots, probably. My blood left a trail behind us, the only thing proving I had passed through this place at all. We walked for what felt like ten minutes until I noticed a door that was out of the ordinary.\n\nIts chute was open.\n\nI stopped. The figure ahead of me stopped as well. It didn’t pull me forward. I hesitated, watching to see if my escorts would stop me. \n\nThey didn't. \n\nI crouched down, peering inside. The smell of decay hit me instantly. Instinctively, I wanted to pull back but fought against it. The dimly lit room beyond held something… wrong.\n\nA creature sat inside, one leg tucked under another. Its frame was unnaturally thin, skin clinging to it so tightly I could count every vertebrae in its spine. It hunched over something, gnawing. Bone ground against bone with a sickening crunch—like wet gravel beneath heavy boots. Half an antler jutted from its clawed grip, the other half still attached to something covered in brown fur? A deer maybe?\n\n\"What in the world…?\" I breathed.\n\nThe thing stopped chewing. Its head snapped all the way around, bones creaking like old wood. Blood and antler shards dripped from its jagged teeth. Its head was that of a deer’s skull. Empty sockets, boring straight into me. Antlers branched outward in chaotic, unnatural angles, as if they’d grown in the wrong direction.\n\nMy muscles locked.\n\nI couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe.\n\nThe thing saw me. Not just my body, but deeper—like it was peeling me apart layer by layer, sinking its gaze into my soul. Its eye sockets began to glow a sickly, unnatural green. A muffled sound cut through the tension—sharp, like a silenced gunshot. The creature crumpled to the floor.\n\nBefore I could process what had happened, a force shoved me forward. I stumbled, whipping my head around to glare at my masked escort. From beneath its cloak, a withered, translucent-gray arm slithered outward. It raised one long, bony finger and pointed down the hall. I swallowed my anger, turned away, and walked.\n\nMy heart still pounded against my ribs, my mind looping over what I had just seen. So many questions raced through my mind but one thing stood out from the rest. That creature wasn't eating a deer…\n\nIt was eating a person.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity of walking, we finally stopped at a door. The figure behind me stepped forward and pushed it open.\n\nA heavy darkness loomed inside.\n\nThe only thing I could make out was an operating table. Its cold surface faintly glinting under the weak reflection of the hallway light. The figure gripping my leash took a step forward, yanking hard, urging me to follow. I resisted, planting my feet. My mind spiraled into panic. What were they going to do to me? Harvest my organs? Is this some kind of black market operation?\n\nBefore I could react further, the other figure shoved me forward. I stumbled into the room, my breath quick and shallow. Seizing my arms—their grip like iron—they forced  me onto the table. Straps coiled around my limbs, pinning me down. I thrashed, desperate to escape, but the restraints held firm. Terror clawed at my throat. A mask pressed over my nose and mouth. A sickly-sweet chemical filled my lungs. My thoughts blurred. My limbs grew heavy. The darkness swallowed me whole.\n\nI blacked out.\n\nI was in and out of consciousness. Blinding surgical lights overhead. Figures in masks, their faces blurred, their eyes hidden. The metallic scent of blood. A gloved hand reaching into me. A wet, sickening squelch. A pan beside me—filled with something.\n\nI wanted to scream.\n\nI jolted awake, gasping. I was back. Back in the small, suffocating room from before. My hands trembled as I clawed at my shirt, yanking it up. I was mentally preparing myself for what I was about to see.\n\nNothing.\n\nNo stitches. No pain. No sign that anything had been done to me. Was it a nightmare? A hallucination? Then I saw it. \n\nOn my left wrist, just below my palm, was something that hadn’t been there before.\n\nA tattoo. \n\nThin, delicate lines forming a pair of butterfly—or maybe moth—wings? Between them was a number—267.\n\nI kept being dragged back to that room with each passing moment a cruel reminder of what was happening to me. Sometimes, I caught more brief, disorienting flashes of the surgical procedures being done to my body. \n\nThe more times they dragged me back, the more “food” they’d leave for me. At first, I couldn’t even bring myself to look at it. I’d sit in the corner, arms wrapped around my knees, trying to hold on to the sharp edge of my hunger. But hunger changes things.\n\nI finally looked. \n\nIt wasn’t like any food I’d ever seen. Just a grey, pulpy mass, like chewed meat spat out and left to fester. Thin, stringy veins crisscrossed the surface, some still pulsing faintly, like whatever it was hadn’t quite given up yet. Bits of cartilage jutted out from the mush, like teeth trapped in gum.\n\nI held out for as long as I could, telling myself I wouldn’t—couldn’t—eat it. But the smell... it worked its way into my head. It didn’t smell rotten, not exactly. It smelled warm. Familiar. \n\nMy stomach ached so bad it felt like something gnawing me from the inside. The moment it touched my tongue, the floodgates opened. My mind screamed at me to stop, but my body didn’t listen. Bite after bite, I devoured it, barely registering the wet snap of cartilage or the sponge-like texture soaking the inside of my mouth. The worst part wasn’t eating it.\n\nThe worst part was how good it tasted.\n\nI kept eating the “food” they’d bring me but hunger wasn’t what drove me anymore. It was something else. Something worse. \n\nI wanted it.\n\nThe longer I stayed in this place, the more I could feel pieces of myself slipping away. When did my fingernails grow this long? When did I lose weight? The world outside started to feel like some distant, half-forgotten dream. My name, my voice, the sound of laughter—all of it eroding, like water slowly wearing down stone.\n\nHope became a foreign concept. I stopped wondering if I’d ever leave.\n\nThe only certainty was the cold fluorescent lights, the sting of anesthesia, and the endless cycle of being cut apart and sewn back together. Until one day, as I was being ushered through the long, sterile hallways, I saw something—a face I knew all too well. \n\nRyan.\n\nHe was being escorted in the same way I was. And he looked rough. His long hair hung in tangled clumps, and his beard was rough, unkempt—at least a couple inches longer than I remembered. For a brief second, his eyes found mine. He shot me a look, it was the kind of look that says everything without speaking a word. \"Let’s get the fuck out of here.\"\n\nMy heart started pounding. We were in this together now. It might take time, but I was determined—our next meeting wouldn’t be our last.\n\nIt felt like weeks had passed before I saw Ryan again. \n\nWhen I finally encountered him again, I noticed the tips of his fingers were scabbed over. He bumped into me—intentional, calculated. He slipped two small, folded pieces of cloth into my hand. One felt soft, almost like worn bedsheets; the other, rough and crusted. \"Put the soft piece in the door bolt when you get back,\" he whispered, his voice barely audible. We were shoved forward by the guards, and I was escorted back to my room. \n\nOne of the figures unlocked the door, and as soon as it creaked open, I slid the soft fabric into the bolt. The door slammed shut behind me, but this time there was no sharp click of the door locking. I quickly pulled the other piece of cloth from my pocket. Two words scrawled in blood sent a cold shiver through me:\n\n“8 Hours.”\n\n**\\[END OF PART 2\\]**"},"9":{"title":"I still don’t know what we saw that night...","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kbd81v\/i_still_dont_know_what_we_saw_that_night\/","flair":null,"author":"That-Imagination9521","selftext":"*Everything I’m about to share is true to my memory. I don’t care if you believe me. I just want it off my chest. I still can’t sleep properly because of what happened that night.*\n\nOkay… I’m trembling as I write this. Not because it just happened recently, but because the incident was so horrific that even putting it into words makes my heart skip a few beats.\n\nHi. My name is Duke. Not *the* Duke you might be imagining—but that’s what my friends call me. This happened years ago, back when I was in high school. I can't remember the exact year, but it's something that’s burned into my memory forever.\n\nBack then, I was the typical party kid—staying out late, hanging with friends, living for the moment. That night was supposed to be like any other. We planned a simple sleepover at my friend Darren’s place. Darren was that one guy whose parents *never* gave a damn about anything. Parties, music, drinking—you name it. So we figured, why not chill at his place, drink a few beers, and talk about life under the moonlight?\n\nSo night came. It was me, Kyle, and Lenny who showed up at Darren’s place. His parents were out visiting an aunt, and he had the house to himself. We started drinking, talking, and just enjoying the night.\n\nThen things started to get... weird.\n\nWe were in the middle of a deep conversation when the power went out. But here's the strange part—only Darren’s house lost power. The streetlights and neighboring homes still had electricity. It was odd, but not *scary*… at first.\n\nWe shrugged it off since the moonlight gave us enough visibility through the windows. But it was still a bit dim, so Kyle asked Darren to get a candle or something. Darren nodded and started to get up—\n\nThen **a lamp** flew into the room.\n\nIt came out of *nowhere*—from the direction of the hallway. It smashed on the floor, glass everywhere. We just froze.\n\nDarren, being the curious one, decided to go check it out. He grabbed his phone and stepped into the hallway. The rest of us stayed behind, waiting. A minute or two passed in silence.\n\nThen we heard **screaming**.\n\nWe jumped up, ready to run to him, when Darren suddenly burst back into the room and locked the door behind him. He was pale, shaking. We all asked what had happened, and his voice was trembling as he told us.\n\nHe said he thought maybe a thief had broken in and was messing with us. But as he searched the downstairs area, he suddenly heard voices… **his parents’ voices**.\n\nWhich made no sense—they were supposed to be out of town for two days.\n\nHe called out: *“Mom? Dad? Is that you?”*\n\nAnd the voice replied: *“Yes… please come here.”*\n\nSomething about it felt *off*, but Darren hesitated only for a moment before heading toward the living room. He pointed his flashlight across the room… and that’s when he saw it.\n\nTwo figures, crouching behind the couch. He recognized the shapes—it was his parents. Or at least, it *looked* like them. He could see their backs, their clothes.\n\nHe whispered, *“Mom? Dad?”*\n\nThen the living room light **flickered briefly… and went out again**.\n\nIn that short flash of light, the two figures stood up slowly and said:\n\n**“Come closer, sweetheart.”**\n\nDarren said his body froze. Something wasn’t right. So he took a step back and asked, *“What the hell is going on?”*\n\nThen the two figures fully stepped out from behind the couch…\n\nAnd **they had no heads**.\n\nBlood was pouring from where their necks should’ve been. Their bodies were swaying as if they were puppets held up by invisible strings.\n\nThat’s when Darren screamed and ran back upstairs.\n\nAs he finished telling us this, we were all trying to process it. Was this a prank? But that didn’t explain the flying lamp—or the look of sheer terror on Darren’s face.\n\nThen, **a knock on the door**.\n\nThree knocks.\n\nWe all went completely still.\n\nThen a voice spoke from the other side:\n\n**“Darren, honey… can you please open the door?”**\n\nIt was his mother’s voice.\n\nOr… something *trying* to sound like her.\n\nNone of us answered. No one dared move.\n\nThen the voice came again, a little more insistent:  \n**“Please, sweetheart. Open the door.”**\n\nStill, we stayed frozen.\n\nThen, the voice changed. It deepened, twisted—*wrong*.\n\n**“OPEN THE DOOR. I SAID!... OPEN IT!!”**\n\nWe backed into the farthest corner of the room, all of us staring at the door, waiting for it to burst open.\n\nBut it never did.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, Lenny—yes, *Lenny*—pulled out a cigarette and lit it up.\n\nI gave him a look like *Are you serious right now?* But he whispered back that in his culture, lighting a flame—especially a cigarette—wards off evil spirits.\n\nWe were desperate, so we didn’t question it.\n\nAnd almost immediately… the voice behind the door **stopped**.\n\nJust like that.\n\nWe stayed up the rest of the night—completely sober despite all the beer—huddled together. Every hour or so, Lenny lit up another cigarette, just to be sure.\n\nMorning finally came. Darren called his real parents. They were still at his aunt’s place, just like they said they would be. They rushed back after hearing what had happened.\n\nSince that day, none of us ever did another sleepover without a full pack of cigarettes. And definitely *never* home alone.\n\nNow, maybe this story doesn’t sound scary to *you*. But even now, I still remember that voice behind the door—Darren’s “mom” begging us to open it.\n\nI still wonder…\n\n**What would’ve happened if we did?**..\n\nThanks for reading this all the way to the end... I had a more terrifying incident with my friends after this one...

A dark, ugly secret. Most of the time nobody speaks of it, the horror’s better left unsaid. Now that’s not to say some haven’t tried to reveal the truth of what transpires here every seven years. For all I know none have been successful. Yet today, I take that risk. I’m posting our secret for the world to read. Surely it will be disregarded as fiction, but that is no matter. I simply must tell my story whether you believe it or not.\n\nMy home is nothing more than a spec on your map. A rural farm town, far off the beaten path of modern America. 1200+ residents, secluded far from any highway. Few outsiders visit without a purpose, and most who live here were born here. And none will ever leave. It is a self imposed prison. It is paradise. It is where I was born, where my daughter was born, her son was born. Our line is rather young compared to the others. My parents were one of the few transplants to this magical place I call home. \n\nNobody knows where the water came from or why. Legend has it a small band of Indians discovered it bubbling up through the ground long ago. A few of them are still around but I’m afraid to ask about it. Questions like that are mostly forbidden. All that is certain is the water naturally pooled there. Its source springing from deep within the earth. Early accounts tell of how those first Indians gathered large rocks in a ring containing the water and its source into a small pond. That is its beginning. \n\nToday it would look very different than in its long past. Now it looks like any ordinary Olympic sized swimming pool. One you would find in any recreation center across the States. Equipped with all the modern amenities one would wish for. However, you will never see anyone swimming in it. No one dares enter the dark murky water that fills its unimaginable depths but once every seven years. Long ago some brave souls tried to reach its bottom, but none returned successfully. That reckless behavior was abandoned for good.  \n\nThese days there are no inquiries, no experiments or explanations. It just is. And we all accept it as such. For in that water. That deep, unnatural looking water, all your dreams will come true. \n\nFor a price. \n\nI am two hundred and seventy-three years old. Part of one of the youngest cohorts. My hair black as night, with skin as soft as cream. I’m strong as an ox with facial features envied by both men and women. I’m attractive and articulate. Successful and charming. I have a wonderful life. We all have wonderful lives. Long, prosperous and filled with pleasures. \n\nAnd all we must do is swim. Once every seven years all must bathe in the waters, crammed in like sardines. It comes then up then and counts. Far from below. How many miles down it lives can only be guessed. But all our bloodlines must enter the water and wait. Otherwise, we risk its anger.  \n\nIt doesn’t like clothes. How they figured that out I’ll never know. I’ve only seen it angered twice in my lifetime, but the last of the Indians say it was far more common long ago. Luckily our ancestors figured things out over time. Learned how to keeps its anger at bay. For It’s been 49 years since its last tantrum. We lost 314 that year. I can still remember the screams. Assumed I would join them, for the creature focused on me for a time. Its slippery touch probing every inch of my body, tugging and pulling, squeezing. Searching.\n\nIt even grazed my lips, searching for an entrance before suddenly releasing its grasp. I’ve never felt anything like that since. Its touch only glancing my skin to count. But I will never forget that moment, the foreignness, its alien touch. I was lucky that day, but 314 unfortunate souls did not share my fate. It took each down the deep end, plunging them into its murky lair below. \n\nOn that occasion true sadness followed, not the euphoria of our standard encounters where only a handful of souls are chosen. On those occasions we erupt in joy as the water changes shade, and we drink until all our bellies are full. Praising the generous monster that lurks beneath. \n\nHowever, the day 314 of our community took their final breath I felt both anger and guilt. Yet, I still drank of their death, filling my stomach with the essence of their souls. Lapping it up until the bloat overwhelmed me. And in that moment as the power filled my tired body, rejuvenated once more, I felt something different. A regret perhaps. And as I looked around, I think I saw the same regret in some others. A questioning of our bargain? For although we’d go home tonight reborn into our youth, we’d lost something in their deaths. A part of ourselves. It stung, deep inside the meat of my chest.\n\nDid I leave then? I could have. It is not forbidden after all. All who dwell in my town are free to leave. Go off and live a normal life. But nobody leaves this power. And neither can I.  \n\nAnd so, I sit here and type, posting my story for the world on the eve of another seven years. Tomorrow me and everyone I know will strip down, including my own blood and enter the cool blue waters waiting for the shadow to rise. There we will wait, stepped in the mix of excitement and dread. Wondering who it will take this time? \n\nIt is not understood who it prefers. Some believes it choice random; others believe it’s a deliberate selection. The oldest of the Indians claims to have lived 2400 years. Nearly 350 choosing’s and he is still here. Certainly, that cannot be luck, can it? My father still lives, he’ll be close by.  Watching if my sister or me is taken. Just as I will eye him and my own offspring hoping they too are not taken. It’s not likely. The odds are almost always in our favor. If nobody disobeys. It gets angry when we disobey. \n\nWe are forbidden to ever speak of it outside of its waters. Only in its depths are we allowed to speak amongst ourselves of its origin and purpose without rebuttal. The elders say its only when we tell outsiders does it stir with rage and punish. \n\nWith that said, I understand the cost of what I do to bring you this tale. The story of a place where one can live forever. Virile and strong. A place to be forever young. Yet I can no longer hold in this urge to speak. For remember what it took from me that day. After a its tentacle left my body, it found my mother. My sweet, kind mother. Eyes wide as the thick as the slimy appendage slid down her throat, deep into her body. She couldn’t scream, but tried anyway, thrashing in pain as the creature pulled her into the deep end. Slow and agonizing it hunts. Taking each person one by one below. We spent 16 hours in its waters before it was satisfied. That is what anger will do. I began to hate it then. Hate us for feeding it\n\nWhat will it do tomorrow when we step into its waters? Will it know of what I’ve done? How many will it take in revenge? Will I be one of the unlucky ones? Or will it spare me again and gift me with everlasting life? \n\nI guess you will have to wait and see. "},"11":{"title":"My brother went missing about two weeks ago I found something while going through his apartment.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kbqx1r\/my_brother_went_missing_about_two_weeks_ago_i\/","flair":null,"author":"Available_Dingo_9738","selftext":"Hey guys, I don't know where to talk about this. If anywhere, this would probably receive the best attention with what's happening. Everyone who has heard this has just said my brother was going crazy and relapsed, but I know my brother—hell, he has a Ph.D. in marine geophysics and oceanographic engineering—he's been sober since our dad died in 1984. I won't lie; he was a bit of a junkie for a time. When Dad died, he sobered up. At 19, he got a job to help Mom and me with the bills and started to get his life together. He even got into a local college and eventually transferred to a more prestigious one, thanks to Mom. I was so proud of him for all he'd done. He'd never return to how he was before, let alone over 30 years later. I'm getting sidetracked; I guess what I'm trying to say is I don't believe that he relapsed and just disappeared like my mom does. My brother, Isaac, was last seen on April 18th as he entered his apartment building, and no one saw him leave. I won't pretend to understand a police investigation. Still, they didn't let me into his apartment for the last 12 days. I finally got a call from one of the detectives investigating my brother's disappearance, who told me to come to his apartment so that I could collect some of his belongings and discard what my mother and I didn't want. His landlord mentioned he hadn't paid rent for the last 2 months. He was going to find new tenants.\n\nWalking into my brother's apartment felt weird, as I hadn't been there before. He had moved away from my mother and me over a year ago, and with a newborn, I hadn't been able to get away to visit him until now. It was a decent-sized place, with two bedrooms, one bathroom, and a small living room and kitchen. My brother only used the living room, which was odd, but it was his space. Going through the box from drawer to drawer, I found pictures of my mom and me, as well as some photos of him and two others: a man and a woman, in front of a large boat. I can only assume they were friends or colleagues. It took me a day and a half to box everything up in the apartment; I hadn't found anything of note in the living room; after loading the final box into my car, I went back to the apartment for one final look through, finding nothing in the rooms I decided to go to the bathroom before leaving, and that's when I noticed something weird his bathtub was covered in there weird markings—not going to say ritual symbols or something, but this is something id see in a sci-fi movie or some demon summoning ritual looking around the bathroom I noticed a small voice recorder no bigger than an iPod Nano peeking out behind the back of the toilet; the screen was cracked, and the battery was dead. I decided to charge it when I returned to my hotel and listened to the recording before heading home the next morning. Below is the transcription of the only thing recorded.\n\n*(Recovered Tape—Labeled \"PLAY IF I'M GONE\")*\n\n\\[**Begin recording.**\\]\n\n*(A hiss of static. The faint hum of electrical interference. (A deep inhale.)*\n\n**ISAAC (whispering):**\n\nOkay… this is Dr. Isaac Holloway. If you're listening to this, I've probably vanished, or I'm not *me* anymore. Either way, you have to listen. You have to understand what's happening before it spreads.\n\nI'm recording this because I don't know how long I have left. My thoughts… they're not my own. Not fully. It's like… like someone else is in here with me. Watching. Whispering.\n\nGod. Okay. Deep breath.\n\nIt started with the *Nereus-9* dive. The official reports say I was alone when they pulled me out, that the instruments failed, that there was no valid data, and that I was the only survivor. These are lies. Perhaps they didn't witness what I observed.\n\nThree of us were Dr. Elara Voss, Luis Reyes, and I. We were sent to investigate a sonar anomaly near the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It looked artificial, too symmetrical—an octagon the size of a city block, hidden ten thousand meters below the surface.\n\nIt wasn't a trench. It was a *structure*. Black metal made the structure seamless. It seemed as if it wasn't built, but rather grown. We sent in drones. One entered a tunnel—obsidian smooth walls, humming with… something. Not energy. Not radio. It felt… alive.\n\nThen, the drones went dark. Instruments glitched. The pressure readings stopped making sense. That's when the low hum started. Low. Steady. The sensation is akin to breathing through a stone.\n\nThat night, we dreamed of it.\n\nThe city beneath. Miles wide. Spires and towers are built from coral, bone, and *something else*. A sphere sits in the center. Inside it—something is *waiting*. Not sleeping. Not dead. *Dreaming*.\n\nElara was the first to crack. She started drawing the symbols we saw inside. Glyphs like spirals and veins. They were said not to be a language, but rather a thought. A frequency. We stated that our purpose wasn't exploration. We were there to be… *accepted*.\n\nLuis walked out of the sub. No suit. He smiled as if he had seen heaven. Pressure killed him in an instant. Elara didn't flinch.\n\nShe just whispered, “He’s gone home.\"\n\nAfter that, I started seeing things, even when I was awake: shadows that didn't belong, movements in reflections, whispers in the water tank. The sub itself began to breathe.\n\nThen Elara opened the final hatch. The water should've rushed in. But it didn't. Time froze. My heartbeat *stopped*. Something entered my body.\n\nIt wore a human shape. But it wasn't human. Its skin resembled ink, and its eyes resembled collapsing stars. It didn't speak. It just looked at me. *Inside me.* I felt it rummaging through my head like it was opening drawers.\n\nThen—I woke up.\n\nAlone.\n\nNo water. No, Elara. No, Luis. There was no visible trace of the structure. Everything wiped. They pulled me out of the Nereus, drifting just below the surface, claiming I'd hallucinated everything. But I didn't.\n\nI couldn't have.\n\nThe signal followed me back.\n\nI hear it now in the radiator. The debris ends up in the drain. It gets stuck in my teeth when I bite down too hard. It's *here*. The glyphs are on my skin, under it. I dream in spiral tunnels. I see them in reflections that aren't mine. My phone vibrates without calls. My faucet bleeds black water.\n\nAnd the hum…\n\nIt's getting louder.\n\nLast night, I looked into the bathtub drain, and *something blinked back*. The signal isn't coming from the ocean anymore.\n\nIt's *coming from my apartment*.\n\nI don't think it ever let me go.\n\nI think I'm just a vessel now. A mouth. A *transmitter*.\n\nAnd if I'm right…\n\nIf I'm right, the present is only the beginning.\n\nDo you think we've discovered something down there?\n\nBut we didn't.\n\n**It discovered us.**\n\n\\[**END OF RECORDING.**\\]\n\nI don't know what to think after listening to this. It's my brother, for sure, no doubt about it; I've never heard him with so much conviction in his voice before. It sounds unbelievable, but the situation is genuinely confusing. Could he have just had a mental break from the trauma of losing his college, and this was the story his mind came up with? I have no idea.\n\nThis is the next morning after I listened to the recording. I just took a shower to calm myself and approach the recording with a fresh and clear mind. I don't remember the shower making a light humming sound last night, but it was likely a coincidence. I need your guys' thoughts on this: what should I do? I've contacted my brother's employer, but they consistently refuse to provide any information about his actions over the past month. Right now, I have no information to rely on; this post feels like a desperate attempt to know what happened at this point.\n\n"},"12":{"title":"Mother Dearest","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kbo4uw\/mother_dearest\/","flair":null,"author":"Littlesthours","selftext":"Porcelain Spirit -> (https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k11oax\/porcelain\\_spirit\/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button)\n\nI never thought I'd come back here, but something else has happened.  \n\nFor those of you that don't know, I made a post about a spirit that has essentially been haunting me for, at this point, four weeks. If you want to go ahead and read that first, maybe catch up a little, I went ahead and put a link to it at the top of this post. But for those of you that already know, I guess we can just go ahead and get started.  \n\nI didn’t expect that first post to get that much attention. Honestly, I thought people would just think I had gone insane. But that didn’t seem to be the case, and I even got a comment. I want to say thank you in advance for wishing me safety and address something that was asked.  \n\n*If it wanted to kill you or your kitty, it could have, so what* ***does*** *it want?*  \n\nI mulled over the question for days, gathering evidence along the way. I recorded every sound that beast made when it was trying to attack or just moving around the house. I wrote down every odd thing I noticed, every detail in the differences between it and Hades meows. I scribbled down pictures of what it looked like, of each form it would take. I even managed to capture a video of it lingering outside my bedroom door but when I tried to watch it my phone completely crashed and I had to buy a new one.  \n\nI think it figured out what I was doing.  \n\nThe usual nighttime visit would happen at least four to five times between ten at night and three in the morning. But as the days passed it dwindled down to a mere two. Soon it was just an occasional sniff at the bottom of the door before it lost complete interest. I didn’t even see it in the morning anymore. The usual glimpses I would get were pointless because each time; it wasn’t there. I didn’t like that. I didn’t like that it had spent days tormenting me only to hide when I started to retaliate.  \n\nI became upset; desperate.  \n\nI started roaming the house at night.  \n\nEvery night at one I would leave my room and walk around the house with nothing but the light of my phone to guide the way. I didn’t do much, mainly just stood around or rummaged through the cupboards when I was hungry. For five days I did this, turning my back on every strange noise or turning off my phone to be plunged into complete darkness. Anything to draw it out.  \n\nAnd yet, there was nothing.  \n\nI knew it hadn’t completely disappeared because that familiar feeling still stuck to my skin. I knew it hadn't complete disappeared because that familiar feeling still stuck to my skin like honey. The feeling that I was being watched. It was still there, still standing, still watching. But not advancing. It was merely… waiting. But for what?  \n\nIt was 1:30 and like the past few days, I was standing in the middle of the dark kitchen. My phone was pointing to the left, illuminating Hades' water bowl as he drank from it. I attempted to lower the device but as soon as the darkness began to touch the tips of his ears I was met with quite the ferocious glare.  \n\n\"You're a cat, dumbass. You can see in the dark.\" I huffed, eyes rolling as he turned back to the bowl. I lowered the phone despite the annoyed meow I received and looked around the room. The only light besides my phone was the clock on the microwave that I was convinced was there to mock me. Hours of sleep missed over something that I was starting to think really *was* just a nightmare.  \n\nAt that point I figured it was time to give up, but something in my head was nagging for me to do just one more test. The thought dug a hole into the back of my brain like maggots burrowing into a rotting carcass. I couldn't ignore it. So, I turned off the phone and plunged myself into the darkness.  \n\nI stared into the void that was supposedly the living room, watching each little wisp of change that my eyes managed to pick up. There's something funny about the darkness and how it could enhance the senses. Suddenly my ears were picking up on sounds I never made an effort to notice. A dog barked out from a house up the corner, the cry of an ambulance rang from the distant road followed by maybe two or three police cars.   \n\nMy eyes adjusted slowly to the dark environment, and I could start to see the outline of furniture. The couch was big and unconventional like always. The chairs at the dining room table weren’t pushed in all the way. There was a paper bag on the floor just at the corner of the counter, something Hades had been obsessed over ever since we brought it home from the local market.  \n\nBut no monster.  \n\nI sighed; shoulders slumped in defeat. There was no point in trying anymore. I don’t even know why I was trying so hard to find it. Did I want to prove that it was real? That I wasn’t crazy? What would I have even done if I did manage to prove its existence? There have been countless claims of monsters throughout human existence, mine would just be written off as another thing. A myth.  \n\n“C’mon Hades let's just... go watch TV or something. I’ll put on some cartoons. I need something relaxing to watch.\" \n\nHe meowed, stepping away from the bowl to rub against my leg before advancing forward. I trailed behind but didn't get very far because Hades paused at the edge of the kitchen. He stared into the living room, the fur on his back slowly rising as his body arched in a position that looked ready to attack. My eyes widened. In the ten years we've had Hades, I had never seen him like this. \n\nI acted on instinct, pulling a knife from the shelf before scooping him up with one arm. He didn't fight, curling against my chest as he yowled at the void ahead. I held the knife at the ready, breath hitching as a familiar noise reached my ears. \n\n*Footsteps.* \n\nMy grip tightened, my breathing slowed, it felt like time had stopped. There was only me and the darkness. \n\nThe light flickered on, and I screeched, waving the knife around like a mad man. \n\n\"Fuck you! Fuck you, you ugly bastard! Stay away from me!\" \n\n\"Hey, hey! Calm the fuck down!\" \n\nI froze, finally letting my eyes adjust to the sudden brightness of the kitchen. My gaze flickered towards the light switch where my dad was standing. His arms were hung at his sides; hands balled into fists. His brows were knit together in anger, yet his eyes still looked tired from being woken up. \n\n\"What the hell is wrong with you? It's almost two in the morning and you're skulking around in the dark with a knife. Put it down. Now!' \n\nI complied, turning to tuck the knife back where I had found it. Hades stayed curled in my arm, eyes directed towards my father. Even when my neck blocked his view, he kept his head in that same direction. I knew Hades didn't have much of a fondness for him, but the looked in his eyes was odd. Like he was looking at a complete stranger. \n\n\"Sorry, dad.\" I mumbled, feeling embarrassed for having been found such a way. \"I was just trying to-\" \n\n\"I swear to god if you bring up that damn thing *again*, I'll do more than just yell.\" \n\nWhatever response I had tried to come up with deflated on the spot and my body suddenly felt a hundred times heavier. He wouldn't have listened to any kind of excuse anyway. I don't know why I even bothered to try. \n\nHe watched as I rushed past and down the hall to my bedroom where I could hear him yell just one more time before shutting the door, \n\n\"You're lucky you didn't wake up your mother. And if I catch you doing this again, I won't be as nice!\" \n\nYeah, I stopped after that. I didn't want to find out what my dad would do if he found me in the dark again. Luckily mom was on my side. She scolded my father for scaring me and even tried to suggest that I might have been sleepwalking (Which I have never done). He didn't really like that argument but eventually backed down. \n\nI didn't get off with just a warning though. He started making me do yard work as a punishment. Chopping up wood, mowing the lawn, raking up leaves. It sucked. The only housework I want to do is the video game kind; at least then I get some kind of money for my work, even if it is digital. I didn't complain though, I couldn't. In my dad's mind the only pain that mattered was his own. It didn't matter if it was mental or physical, if you complained you were ungrateful for all he'd done and needed to shut the fuck up. \n\nHe'd always been a piece of shit. I'm surprised my mother even stays with him. If it was my choice, we would've both been gone years ago. Maybe life would actually be good. \n\nBut his shitty personality is the very reason I knew something was wrong. One day he just started being nicer. He made me breakfast; a full breakfast. Eggs, bacon, homemade cinnamon waffles. I remember checking the calendar that day to see if it was a special occasion, but it wasn't. It was just the 26th, just a Saturday. The starting point to the worst five days of my life. \n\nOn the 27th he made pancakes that seemed to be buried under a mountain of whipped cream and blueberries. He gave my mom a rather long and gross kiss before leaving to get the grocery shopping done early. As soon as the front door shut, I turned to her. \n\n\"Mama?\" I slid the berries and cream off my pancakes. \"Does dad seem… weird to you?\" \n\n\"What do you mean, baby?\" \n\nI paused. How do you even go about this kind of topic? \n\n\"He just seems off lately. Happier, I guess? Did we win the lottery or something?\" \n\n\"Not that I know of. Why do you ask? Don't you like being pampered?\" she chuckled into her mug of coffee. \n\n\"It's just strange. He's never been, you know, that nice. You don't even like being around him sometimes. I mean how could you?\" It was a bad attempt at humor, something to lighten the mood and maybe get her to open up more. But instead of laughter, I was met with a death glare. \n\n\"Your father is doing his best for this family. if you don't appreciate it, keep it to yourself.\" \n\n\"Whoa! Mama I- I didn't mean to be mean or anything it's just-\" \n\n\"No! Take your pancakes and go eat in your room. Go!\" \n\nI'm man enough to admit that I almost cried right there at the table. My mother yelled on very few occasions and even if she did it was never directed towards me. Nineteen years and this is the first time I'd ever been shouted at. It was honestly frightening. For the first time in my life, I felt frightened of my mother. \n\nI didn't even bother with breakfast; I had no appetite anymore. I just stood from the table and ran off to my bedroom where, now that I was alone, I did cry. Not necessarily because of the shouting, even though it did play a part. \n\nNo, I cried because of the way she looked at me as I left the table. Like I was a burden. Like she hated me; truly and deeply. That wasn't my mother, it couldn't have been. That thing did something to her. \n\nIt did something to them both. \n\nAs the days passed, they got worse. My mother became more angry, more violent. I had accumulated at least seven different punishments in the span of two days. Some were justified; I had started roaming the house at night again due to paranoia. Others were for small things, like when I complained about the heat even though she had done the same not even five seconds before. \n\nMy father started requesting more time together. He taught me how to bake bread and cooked my favorite meals. He even took me out to the art museum, something I had been wanting to visit since we first moved here. It was a wonderful time, and he even stopped at a few places to get fro-yo and a brand-new game console. He hadn't bought me a proper gift in over a decade. Lord forgive me but whatever that thing did to my father might've just been a blessing. \n\nHe was the complete opposite of his former self, they both were. It was almost like they switched personalities and then multiplied their habits by hundreds. \n\nAll good things don't last though, because today was the day it all crumbled. \n\nI had been in the bathroom brushing my teeth when I heard it; the shouting. My mother. I had slowly gotten used to it over the past three days, though I couldn't help but flinch when I heard her smash a plate against the floor which was followed by the sound of my father's please for her to calm down. \n\nI leaned over the sink to spit up the mixture of toothpaste and saliva in my mouth when my ears decided to block out every sound but one. A thump. Something had been hit. I froze. Had my mother become deranged enough to put her hands on my father? No, surely not. My head turned to the open doorway to yell out, to ask if something was wrong, when I heard something else. \n\nHades' cry. \n\nI bolted to the kitchen where my mother stood in the middle, body shaking with anger, my father was a few steps ahead of her, eyes wide and shaky hands raised in a placating manner. I looked around, heart dropping when I noticed the small lump behind him. \n\nIt was Hades. He was laying on the ground, eyes shut and body limp. His breathing was heavy, but it was still breathing. \n\nMy fists curled. \n\n\"What did you do to him?\" \n\nNo response. \n\n\"What the fuck did you do to him?!\" \n\n\"She kicked him.\" \n\nI looked at my father and he looked back. There were tears in his eyes. \n\n\"He only wanted a treat.\" \n\nI choked on a sudden sob, directing a glare in my mother's direction. She just stood there and stared. She didn't care, not one bit. I watched as her lips curled high, higher than what was physically possible. \n\nShe was proud. Proud to have hurt Hades, proud to have frightened my father to the point of tears, proud to see the way I seethed with anger. \n\nAnd she was only getting started. \n\nI remember the way her body contorted. The sounds of bones breaking as limbs twisted and turned in directions they weren't supposed to. Her lower half was backwards now, legs bent and positioned like a spider. Her torso fell against the ground like that part of her had gone limp, arms elongating and claw-like nails digging into the tiled flooring. Her eyes rolled back like they weren't connected to the socket and her upper lip protruded like some kind of duck bill, one long sharp tooth positioned at the front. I can still see the way her jaw hung like it was broken. I can still hear the noise she made, a low groan that bubbled up from her gut. \n\nI heard my father whimper before Hades was suddenly shoved into my arms. \n\n*\"Run.\"* \n\nShe bolted forward as soon as that word left his lips, feet pounding against the floor as she used her nails to drag the upper part of her forward. I ran down the hall as she toppled him, listening to the sounds of his screams as I shut and locked the door. \n\nI laid Hades on the desk before prying the window open and grabbing a pair of scissors. I stabbed into the window screen, twisting the end until a small hole formed just big enough for me to cut out the whole thing. After tossing the scissors aside, I picked up Hades and tucked him underneath my shirt. \n\n\"Baby?\" \n\nHer head hit the door. \n\n\"Come unlock the door for your mama.\" \n\nHer claws reached underneath the bottom, scrapping against the hardwood. \n\n*\"Let me in you little bitch!\"* \n\nShe slammed her body against the door, making the whole room shake. The house filled with the sounds of her shrieking, claws digging at the floor so hard that the panels started to come up. I heard the creak of the doors hinges and knew I had to hurry. \n\nSo, I dove out the window. \n\nMy body curled protectively around Hades as we rolled down the hill before coming to a complete stop against the road below. I stood slowly, blinking to refocus my gaze, and ran. I ran until it hurt to breath, until my legs were screaming with pain and my throat felt like sandpaper. I ran until were on the opposite end of the neighborhood and outside Miss Beatrice's house. \n\nMy side slammed against the front door at full speed, body sliding downwards to slump on the porch. I watched as the lights flickered on and listened to the sound of her approaching footsteps. My vision darkened just as the door opened. \n\nI woke up to Hades licking my cheek and about three different policemen standing around me. Apparently, Beatrice had called the police after finding me unconscious and directed them to my home in worry that my parents had been abusing me. Honestly, I wish it were that simple. \n\nThey told me that every light in the house was on when they went to go check it out. My bedroom door had been smashed to bits and the room itself was completely destroyed. The kitchen was a mess, cutlery all over the floor and the glass of the oven door shattered along with it. In front of the dining room table was a puddle of blood where my father had been attacked. A trail of it led to one of the windows which had been completely torn from the wall. There was no body. \n\nI gave my statement, recounting every detail I could remember. They looked at me like I was crazy, I think they even considered bringing me in. But Beatrice somehow talked them out of it. \n\nSpeaking of, she had offered for me to stay until I was capable of living on my own. She tidied up the guest room as nicely as she could and baked some fresh cookies to help 'bring a little cheer' after what I had been through. \n\nSo now I'm here, eating some cookies and watching a random movie from her collection of VHS tapes. Hades is stretched out against my leg, ears raised and alert for any possible danger. We're going to take him to the vet tomorrow to make sure my mom didn't do any permanent damage to him. \n\nI don't know if she's still out there or if she even knows where I am. I don't know if she's ever going to come back. \n\nAll I know is that for the first time in four weeks, I'm in a safe place. \n\nAnd I'm going to enjoy my time here. \n\nEven if that feeling still lingers. "},"13":{"title":"A melody that no one should ever play","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kbnvrr\/a_melody_that_no_one_should_ever_play\/","flair":null,"author":"nadeniss","selftext":"I’m a freelance composer.

The whole concept was little more than water-cooler myth. Ghost stories for Analysts.\n\nAnd yet…\n\n“My friend swore she saw a memo once—said there was a Joker locked in Vault 6. Might even be an Ace.”\n\nSomebody snorted. “Your friend’s an idiot. Vaults only go to 5. I’ve *been* to 5, and trust me—nothing could escape those cells.”\n\nThe Jack exhaled. Like a furnace choking on blood.\n\nThe office fell dead quiet.\n\n“Must be a containment breach,” someone whispered, voice raw. “Only reason Clubs ever come topside.”\n\nMy stomach dropped. A breach meant something had gotten out. Which meant blood. Which meant bodies. Which meant paperwork.\n\n*Shit.*\n\nAnd I wasn’t the only one panicking. Fear jumped from desk to desk like static. Within seconds, the whole floor had dissolved into murmurs, gasps, shifting feet.\n\nThat’s when Edwards, our timid supervisor, finally emerged from his cubicle. Pale and sweating. The moment he saw the Jack, his eyes went full dinner plate, like he was halfway through a heart attack. \n\n“Oh my…” he gasped, momentarily forgetting how to speak. “R-Relax, everyone. This is… obviously a miscommunication. I’ll get it sorted right away.”\n\nHe cleared his throat and forced a smile, like a man trying to be polite to an avalanche.\n\n“Good morn—err, afternoon, Mr. uhh—Clubs. You seem to be… lost. Understandable. Big bunker and all. Why don’t I walk you back to the elevator, hm?”\n\nThe Overseer didn’t react.\n\nEdwards reached out, gave its arm a light tug, like a dad coaxing a toddler from the toy aisle.\n\nIt didn’t budge.\n\nIts head snapped sideways—fast. It moved not like something alive, but like a memory. Jerking. Disjointed. Unfinished. Its eyes were black voids, buried in bark-twisted sockets.\n\nAnd they stared.\n\nAt me.\n\n“Analyst Reyes…” it rasped.\n\nThe room froze.\n\nNot a breath. Not a whisper.\n\nJust my name—hanging in the air like a curse.\n\nI didn’t even know they could *talk.*\n\nMy legs moved on autopilot, inching backward until I hit the wall. My heart kicked at my ribs like it wanted *out.*\n\nThe Overseer raised one hand—fingers long and curling. \n\nBeckoning.\n\nI gulped. Pointed at myself with a shaking finger. “You… want *me*?”\n\nIt nodded. Its neck creaked like ancient timber splitting in the cold.\n\nI turned, scanning the room. Desperate for someone to speak. To intervene. To *help.* But all I saw were lowered heads. Avoidant eyes.\n\nCowards in pressed collars, hiding behind masks of bureaucratic obedience.\n\nFuck. \n\nOf all the Overseers… why did it have to be a Clubs? They were known for one thing, and one thing only.\n\nViolence.\n\n“Mr. Edwards,” I stammered, voice breaking. “This isn’t protocol. Tell this thing it can’t *do* this.”\n\nEdwards—gaunt with a mane of silver hair—set his jaw. He took a breath. Squared his shoulders the way I imagine soldiers do when someone yells incoming. “Now listen here. My employee is absolutely right. You have *no authority* to—”\n\nThe Overseer moved, dragging Edwards behind it like lint on a sleeve.\n\n“**Analyst Reyes,**” it said again in a low and final tone. “You have been *requested.* Specifically.”\n\nFingers like steel cables coiled around my tie.\n\nLifted.\n\nI thrashed. Kicked. Didn’t matter. I was a paperclip dangling from a skyscraper, and no matter how loud I shouted, nobody dared to move. \n\nThey just watched. Stunned. Haunted. Like it was already too late. \n\n“**Stop!**” Edwards bellowed, his voice losing its nervous tremble. My anxious supervisor suddenly found his spark—turning braver than the whole office combined.\n\n“For God’s sake,” he shouted, chasing us into the hall. “You *can’t* just abduct my staff! The Inquisition will have your *head* for this—you’ll be shuffled back into the bloody Deck!”\n\nThe Overseer paused at the elevator. Turned back.\n\n“The Inquisition,” it said, almost amused. “... Who do you think sent me?”\n\nEdwards’ jaw dropped.\n\n“No…” he whispered. “They wouldn’t. Not an employee. Not unless—”\n\nThe PA crackled overhead.\n\nA woman’s voice, cold as ice and sharp as law:\n\n“**Edwards. Stand down.**”\n\nHis face drained of color. The fire in his eyes vanished, replaced by something closer to shock—almost… betrayal.\n\n“…Owens?” he whispered, staring up at the hallway camera.\n\nOwens.\n\nDirector of Inquisitions. \n\nWonderful.\n\nIf she wanted me—if she'd personally signed the order—then something was very wrong here.\n\n“Why now?” Edwards asked, voice choked. “Reyes isn’t—”\n\nThe PA cut him off.\n\n“The situation has changed.”\n\nA pause.\n\n“The First Draft has stirred again. It seeks the Pair.”\n\nThe First Draft?\n\nThe Pair?\n\nI’d never heard the terms. Were they some kind of codename? Some buried Conscripts that no one talked about?\n\n“That can’t be right,” Edwards muttered, voice haunted. “The First Draft—Ash, we agreed it wasn’t real.”\n\n“And we were wrong.”\n\nEdwards stopped breathing.\n\nOwens’ voice again. Cold. Final.\n\n“Jack of Clubs. Bring Analyst Reyes to Chamber 13. Immediately.”\n\n“Chamber 13?” Edwards reeled. “You can’t be serious. You can't honestly think Reyes is—”\n\n“Enough, Edwards. Let me clarify the stakes: either the Order ends tonight… or Reyes does.”\n\nThe PA crackled as Owens signed off.\n\nEdwards slumped against the wall. His face not registering fear, but petrified resignation.\n\n“Wait!” I shouted, lunging forward. “Please—!”\n\nBut I saw it then, just before the elevator doors slid shut. Edwards staring at us. Like he’d seen a ghost, like his worst nightmare had somehow dreamed itself to life.\n\nOnly he wasn’t looking at the monster. \n\nHe was looking at me.\n\n**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**\n\nThe elevator hissed shut.\n\nThe Overseer clamped a tarantula-sized hand around my neck. It jabbed a finger at the elevator panel, each input stiff and deliberate, like it was bullying the building itself.\n\nThe screen above flickered.\n\nNot green. Not blue.\n\nRed.\n\nTen digits scrolled across in silence. No labels. No indicators. Just a blinking cursor and a sound like a lock being unpicked in reverse. Owens told the Overseer to bring me to Chamber 13. I’d never heard of it—but whatever it was, it turned Edwards whiter than a sheet. \n\n“Where’s Chamber 13?” I croaked. \n\nThe Overseer turned those hollow sockets on me. Its voice was dry as rust. “Within... the Vaults.”\n\nMy blood curdled. The Vaults were for Conscripts—monsters. They were buried at the bottom of the bunker, the kind of deep that doesn’t show up on maps, only warnings.\n\n“There’s been a mistake,” I said, pulse pounding. “I’m not cleared for anything below Level Three. Listen, I’m just an Analyst. I punch numbers. I run audits. I don't—”\n\nThe elevator jolted violently.\n\nA groan like bending steel. Then a *crack!*—sharp, sudden. One cable. Then another.\n\n“Oh, fuck…”\n\nWe dropped.\n\nNot a smooth descent. Not free fall.\n\nThis was *propulsion*.\n\nAs if the earth had opened its throat and we were being swallowed whole.\n\nI tried to scream. What came out was a ragged choke, my cheeks flapping like canvas in a gale.\n\nThe Overseer didn’t flinch. It shoved me down, flattening me against the floor.\n\nWind screamed through vents. The walls trembled. My ears rang. My body wasn’t falling—it was *disappearing*.\n\nLight shrank to a pinprick. Pressure caved in. My knees buckled. My head swam.\n\nJust before everything vanished, I heard the voice.\n\nNot the Overseer’s.\n\nHers. \n\nThe woman that haunted my dreams.\n\nThe Ma’am.\n\nIt rang all around me. Syrupy. Mocking.\n\n*“Never forget that I’m the one writing your story,”* she hissed from everywhere and nowhere. *“And that I'll end it just as soon as I please.”*\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nAnd just like that—I was back there.\n\nBack in the house I tried to forget.\n\nSunlight filtered through slats in the boarded windows, casting stripes of gold and shadow across the breakfast table. A pale tree had broken through the floorboards and grown tall through the ceiling. Its bark smooth. Bone-colored. Its branches were heavy with parchment where there should have been leaves.\n\nThe Ma’am reached up and plucked one.\n\nShe returned to the table, where her latest draft lay scattered. Her glasses rested low on her nose, her pen already back in motion. She didn’t look at me.\n\nI never called her mother.\n\nIt wasn’t allowed. \n\nShe said *Ma’am* was a title of respect. Said it would make me a better boy than the others—the ones she sent outside. The ones who never came back from the Thousand-Acre Wood.\n\n“You’re staring,” she noted, still marking the page. “You know that isn’t welcome behavior, Boy.”\n\nI mumbled an apology and lowered my eyes to the plate. My eggs had gone cold.\n\nHer fingers began to drum. Slow. Uneven. A rhythm I knew by heart—the countdown to something cruel. Then, with a sharp exhale, she dropped the pen.\n\n“Eat,” she snapped. “Carol didn’t make those eggs so you could stir them like a little brat, did you, Carol?”\n\nBehind me, something clanged.\n\nCarol—the older woman who hovered by the stove like a caretaker and a ghost—hurried forward, wiping her hands on her apron. Her plate trembled in her grip, but her smile… somehow, it stayed warm.\n\nAlways warm.\n\n“He’ll learn, dear,” she said gently. “He’s still just a child.”\n\nI smiled at her. Small. Grateful. Even now, I could feel it—that aching kind of affection that blooms after a nightmare, sharp and tender and temporary. She was the only one who ever tried to protect me.\n\nCarol set her plate down and ruffled my hair with a hand that smelled like thyme and dish soap.\n\n“He can’t help being distracted on occasion,” she teased. “Isn’t that right, Levi?”\n\nThe name cracked the moment in half.\n\nThe Ma’am’s mug detonated against the table. Coffee splashed across pages and skin. Her face didn’t move, but her eyes had locked onto Carol with a heat that could’ve peeled wallpaper.\n\n“What did I say about using that name?” she hissed. “He is to be referred to as *Boy*—until such time I decide to keep him.”\n\nCarol froze. Her smile withered.\n\nThe Ma’am turned her gaze to me. Her voice went soft.\n\n“Isn’t that right… *Boy*?”\n\nI nodded quickly, stuffing a bite of egg into my mouth like it might save me. \n\nCarol’s voice came smaller now. “It’s just… maybe he’d do better if he had more encouragement. More love.”\n\nThe Ma’am stood.\n\nThe slap came without warning.\n\nA sharp crack against Carol’s cheek. The second blow was already rising.\n\nI was on my feet before I even realized it. “Don’t!”\n\nThe Ma’am turned.\n\nSlow. Methodical. Like a snake uncoiling mid-strike. \n\n“Did you just give me a command, *Boy*?”\n\nEach step she took sounded louder than it should’ve. Like the house was listening.\n\nThe Ma’am was a small woman, brittle at the edges, with goldenrod hair that might’ve once made her look soft. But her beauty had curdled. Her cheekbones jutted like broken glass. Her eyes were bone-dry wells.\n\nAnd still—still—I was terrified of her.\n\n“It wasn’t a command, Ma’am,” I said, heart galloping. “I only meant… it wasn’t Carol’s fault. I messed up. So I should be punished.”\n\nShe blinked. Once.\n\nThen smiled.\n\nThat awful, thin-lipped smile. The one that said *I win.*\n\n“You see, you old crone?” she crooned, not even glancing at Carol. “The Boy doesn’t need affection. He needs *correction.* Even he understands that.”\n\nShe sank back into her chair, plucking a fresh page from the branches above.\n\n“Maybe he won’t end up like the rest of his worthless siblings,” she said, almost cheerfully. “The last thing this family needs is another failed draft.”\n\nCarol stood still. Her hands trembled at her sides.\n\nThe Ma’am’s voice snapped like a whip. “Well? Are you deaf *and* senile? You made me break my mug. Clean it up. Or I’ll send you to the woods too.”\n\nCarol didn’t move.\n\nNot at first.\n\nFor a single breath, her face hardened. And for the first time, I saw it. Not fear. **Defiance.**\n\nThen she looked at me.\n\nAnd what I saw in her eyes wasn’t pity. It wasn’t grief.\n\nIt was love.\n\nThe kind that stays, even when leaving would be easier.\n\nShe knew exile would be safer. That the forest, with its Hungry Things and whispers, was still kinder than the Ma’am. But she wouldn’t leave me behind.\n\nShe straightened, hands still trembling.\n\n“Of course, dear,” she said quietly. “My mistake.”\n\nI wanted to scream. To tell her it *wasn’t her mistake.* That the Ma’am deserved the woods. Deserved worse.\n\nBut I didn’t.\n\nBecause this wasn’t real.\n\nThis was a memory.\n\nAnd now the edges were beginning to rot. The wallpaper peeled in long curls like shedding skin. The windows oozed. Table legs warped and coiled like roots seeking soil.\n\nAnd the portraits—\n\nDozens of them. Hung crooked. Bleeding. The Ma’am’s visions of her monster. The Hare.\n\nSome bore antlers. Others wore hats. One had no face at all.\n\nAnd still, they smiled.\n\nTheir mouths opened in eerie unison, wide and wet and grinning. And they sang my name.\n\nSoft. Rhythmic. Like a lullaby at a funeral.\n\nI reached out to tear one from the wall, and the whole world came down with it. \n\n**\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_**\n\nI jolted awake to the sound of steel screaming.\n\nThe elevator was still falling. Groaning, buckling, folding in on itself like a dying animal.\n\nI tried to move—couldn’t. Thick arms locked me in place. The Overseer. It must’ve caught me when I blacked out, snatching me out of the air before physics could pulp me against the ceiling.\n\nChrist.\n\nI twisted in its grip, craning my neck toward the gnarled wicker mask. The Jack of Clubs stared back, hollow sockets swallowing all light.\n\n“Brace yourself,” it growled.\n\nThe shriek that followed could’ve cracked teeth. The brakes had kicked in, but they were losing. The Overseer lifted me off the grated floor, cradling me like a toddler. \n\nThen—\n\nImpact.\n\nThe world punched upward. Steel howled. Concrete split. My lungs collapsed inward like paper bags. If the Overseer hadn’t absorbed the brunt, my legs would’ve come out my ears.\n\nA soft ding broke the silence. A chipper voice chimed through the speaker overhead:\n\n“**THANK YOU FOR VISITING LEVEL SIX. PLEASE STANDBY FOR REALITY EQUALIZATION.”**\n\nThe Overseer dropped me, my knees hitting metal with a hollow thud. Then came the retching.\n\nWhen I could breathe again, I wiped my mouth with a shaking sleeve. “Did I… Did I hear that right?” My voice sounded like it was trying to crawl out of my throat. “We’re on Level 6? The Sub-Vaults?”\n\nThe Jack of Clubs gave a stiff nod.\n\nNo. No, that wasn’t possible. \n\nThere wasn’t any such thing as Level 6. That was the whole point. Everyone knew the bunker had five levels. Orientation drilled it into us like gospel—five levels and no deeper. You ask about Level 6, you get a warning. Ask twice, you get reassigned. Ask three times?\n\nYou just didn’t.\n\nI gripped my hair, heart thundering. This didn't make sense. None of this made any goddamn sense.\n\nThe Overseer tilted its head, slow as a glitching puppet. “Your eyes,” it whispered. “They sing wrong… songs.”\n\nMy stomach knotted. “My what?”\n\n“We remember when ours sang that way…” The Jack began sniffing, each inhale ragged and wet. It took a step forward. Predatory. Curious. Like something just before a kill. “So faint above… but down here… yes. Down here, your stench is inescapable. Familiar…”\n\nIts hand rose toward my face—\n\n“**REALITY EQUALIZATION COMPLETE**,” the speaker chirped. “**SUB-VAULT ACCESS GRANTED.”**\n\nThe Overseer froze. Then it withdrew like someone hit the reset button. Shook its head. Backed off.\n\nA shudder ran through me. What was going on with this thing—was it malfunctioning?\n\nOr is this why Owens wanted me specifically?\n\n**“PLEASE TRAVERSE THE SUB-VAULTS RESPONSIBLY,”** the speaker continued. **“REMEMBER: YOUR SANITY IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY!”**\n\nSteam hissed from the seams in the wall. The doors screeched open—revealing something impossible.\n\nThe hallway ahead twisted like a draining whirlpool, red-brick walls spiraling into infinity. The corridor turned as I watched it, slow and deliberate, like it was breathing. Moonlight poured down from a black sky. My eyes stung.\n\nThis had to be an illusion. It had to be.\n\nThe Overseer shouldered past me, its bulk making the stone quake. “Stay close,” it ordered. “Do not linger. Do not stray.”\n\nI staggered after it, glancing back at the elevator—which was now twisting too, warping as if it were never built for this world.\n\nWhispers came back to me. Lunch break horror stories. A supposed pocket dimension beneath the bunker, used to house Conscripts that couldn’t be held by conventional means. A collapsible plane of reality. Apparently, the Sub-Vaults would rearrange themselves every few hours, like a maze rewritten in real time, rendering escape impossible. \n\nThrough glass panels, I glimpsed nightmares: geometries that hurt to look at, shapes that shouldn’t exist. Colors with no name—colors that pulsed like tumors. The deeper we traveled, the more I tried to maintain any grasp on reality by subconsciously analyzing the Conscripts. Anchoring myself in what I knew. \n\n“Threat Level 5,” I whispered. “Localized massacre potential. Recommendation: reinforced containment. Threat Level 6….”\n\nCell doors lined the walls—some no larger than confession booths, others yawning wide enough to admit mountains.\n\nOne door had hinges the size of coffins. Another had *teeth*.\n\nI didn’t ask what they held.\n\nA chill spidered down my spine anyway, like some part of me already knew.\n\nLaughter echoed from somewhere distant.\n\nOr maybe sobbing.\n\nOr maybe both—blended into something wet and wrong, the kind of sound that peeled paint and rewrote memories.\n\nI don’t know.\n\nThe deeper we went, the harder it became to separate noise from thought. Sound from shape. Sanity from suggestion.\n\nThe hallway twisted. Twitched. At times, I swore it was breathing.\n\nWe passed two other Overseers.\n\nSpades.\n\nSix and Four.\n\nThey moved like shadows stitched into armor—taller than the Jack of Clubs, but leaner, narrower. Their suits weren’t rusted like his, but smooth. Sleek. Vanta-black, like they’d been skinned from the void. Spade-tipped spears rested in their hands like questions with bloody answers.\n\nThey watched us as we passed. Their heads cocked in mirrored angles. Their voices buzzed, low and backward, like a prayer being unspoken.\n\nA language made of edits.\n\n“What are they saying?” I whispered.\n\nThe Jack glanced down at me. “They believe you are a variant—an undealt card. They wish to dissect you.”\n\nAn... undealt card?\n\nFootsteps clanged behind us. The Spades smashed their spear tips on the stone and muttered a phrase that sounded like mangled poetry.\n\nWe walked on. The Spades followed for three corridors more, never speaking again. Just watching. Weighing.\n\nAnd then, with one tilt of the Jack’s head—\n\nThey vanished. Slipped back into the walls like bad ideas. Whatever the Jack was, it carried the sort of authority that made even monsters shrink.\n\nEventually, we stopped.\n\nThe Jack reached into its tangled armor and retrieved something impossibly mundane: a brass key.\n\nHe fit it into a door that looked… average.\n\nA white, wooden thing. Slightly scuffed. Maybe pine. The kind you’d find in a dentist’s office or a suburban hallway.\n\nAbove it, a rusted plaque read:\n\n**CHAMBER 13 — RESTRICTED ACCESS ONLY**\n\nThe Jack stepped aside. Gestured for me to enter.\n\nAnd for the first time since we descended, I hesitated.\n\nBecause no door that normal has any right being in a place this wrong.\n\n“Inside,” the Jack ordered.\n\nNothing else for it, I obeyed. \n\nChamber 13 was circular, a stone wheel carved into nothing. A lonely lightbulb hung impossibly from a cracked-open ceiling, where thousands of pages floated in a black expanse. Beneath the bulb were two chairs. A metal table. Nothing else.\n\nThe Jack turned to leave. \n\n“Wait,” I stammered. “That’s it? What am I supposed to do?”\n\nIt paused, paid me a long look. “Write.”\n\n“What? A threat report? A Conscript catalogue? Help me out here.”\n\nThe Jack’s voice dropped like a stone into a still lake. “Your ending.”\n\nMy heart hammered.\n\nCould Overseers tell jokes?\n\n“You have one hour,” it said, tone ironclad. “Should you fail to write an ending, one will be provided for you. I’m told it will not be to your… preference.”\n\nThe door slammed shut like a gavel.\n\nAnd just like that—I was alone.\n\nTerrified.\n\nPanicked.\n\nAnd *achingly* alone.\n\nI lunged for the handle, twisting, yanking. Nothing. The thing was sealed tighter than Alcatraz.\n\nOne hour.\n\nOne ending.\n\nWhy?\n\nIt didn't matter.\n\nI’d worked for the Order long enough to know grunts like me weren't afforded the privilege of questions. If I didn’t scribble something fast, then they’d probably send in a Conscript. Probably one with claws. And teeth. And an appetite for Analysts.\n\nI sank to the floor, back against stone, hands on my knees like they might keep me from shattering.\n\nI’d filed enough T43 reports to know how our monsters killed. Slowly. And with deranged satisfaction. Like children tearing apart their favorite toys just to see what the stuffing looked like.\n\nI gripped a fistful of my hair, pulse rioting to the beat of panic.\n\nMaybe I should just end it myself. Make a noose out of my tie and do one last trust fall with the universe.\n\nYeah.\n\nThat could work.\n\nIf nothing else, it'd save the janitor the trauma of scraping my insides off the walls. I lifted a hand to my collar, then paused.\n\nThe table.\n\nIt wasn’t empty anymore.\n\nSomething waited atop it, framed beneath the cone of flickering light—something *old*, its shape so familiar it twisted my stomach.\n\nA typewriter.\n\nNot modern. Not sleek. *Rustic.* The kind with keys that bit back, edges like teeth, and ribbons stained the color of clotted memory. It looked… *personal* in an awful sort of way. Like it remembered me somehow. Like it *blamed* me.\n\nI stepped forward, breath hitching.\n\nPulled a chair. It scraped back with a screech like bone on stone.\n\nThen I sat.\n\nThe bulb above buzzed louder, casting long, twitching shadows across me. I stared at the typewriter. It stared back.\n\nAnd suddenly I understood. This typewriter was a Conscript—had to be. My job wasn't to write an ending so much as it was to be the Order's guinea pig. There were probably senior Analysts watching the cameras, clipboards at the ready, waiting to determine just what this thing was capable of.\n\n\"Right,\" I breathed. \"Happy thoughts, Reyes.\"\n\nMy fingers settled on the keys—cold metal nubs worn smooth with use. They *hummed*, faintly. Not mechanical. Not electrical. Something *older*.\n\nSomething *alive*.\n\nI gave a passing thought to the kind of ending I *wanted*.\n\nSomething tasteful. Tragic. Maybe bittersweet, if I was feeling literary.\n\nInstead, I settled on the beach.\n\nSomewhere warm. Somewhere quiet. A cabana on a forgotten island where no one knew what the word \"Conscript\" meant. Where my pension came with an umbrella drink and I could finally grow out my hair without Edwards filing a grooming report.\n\nYeah. That’d do.\n\nI cracked my knuckles.\n\nGrinned.\n\nAnd started to type.\n\nOnly—nothing happened.\n\nNo words. No sentences. No punctuation. Not even a pity period.\n\nThe page stayed blank.\n\nI mashed the keys harder. Still nothing.\n\nI sighed, face-planting onto the desk and cradling my head like it might keep the shame in. How the hell was I supposed to write an ending with a busted typewriter?\n\nThen it clicked. \n\nNot metaphorically. \n\nLiterally clicked.\n\nThe typewriter made a sound like it was clearing its throat, and the keys began to move on their own. One by one, deliberate and clean, like fingers guided by something long dead and very patient.\n\n*CLACK. CLACK. CLACK.*\n\nI sat up, watching in numb disbelief as the words etched themselves onto the parchment like stigmata. My pulse thundered. Was it writing my death sentence? Or just spilling all my worst secrets onto the page for whoever found my body?\n\nAnd then I frowned.\n\nIt wasn't writing any of that.\n\nThe stupid thing was writing a work report.\n\nBoilerplate. Standard. A 431C: Threat Classification Summary.\n\nNo kidding.\n\nI’d filed a dozen of them this week alone—boring death-sheets for monsters we couldn’t kill and didn’t understand. But this one…\n\nI leaned forward, the unease creeping back into my bones.\n\nNo, this report wasn't boilerplate. It wasn't standard. This report was making my skin crawl with every word punched onto the page.\n\n**ENTITY DESIGNATION:** THE UNWRITTEN ONE\n\nEvery major field—*Origin. Abilities. Weaknesses.*—was marked with the same word: **UNKNOWN**\n\nI leaned in, stomach twisting.\n\n**Role:** **OVERSEER**\n\nThat's when I pulled back, mind reeling. That couldn't be right. Overseers didn't get Threat Classifications. There wasn't any point—the monsters were practically automatons ensalved to the Order, made to do whatever the Inquisition demanded.\n\nAnd yet the report didn't stop. It kept going.\n\nKept getting worse.\n\n**Suit: NIL**\n\n**Rank: JOKER**\n\nThe word sat on the page like a stain.\n\nJOKER.\n\nI’d heard the rumors. Everyone had.\n\nBarstool nonsense. Analyst ghost stories told during overtime shifts—about mythical cards that didn’t belong to any suit. We joked about Kings and Queens locked in the lowest Vaults. About a secret Ace that could overwrite the entire chain of command.\n\nBut the Joker?\n\nThat wasn’t an Overseer.\n\nThat was a *mistake.* A wild card. A wandering error. A monster so fractured it couldn’t be shuffled into the Deck without breaking the whole thing in two.\n\nThere weren’t supposed to be any because there *couldn’t be.*\n\nBut the typewriter kept typing.\n\nRelentless.\n\nMechanical.\n\nCertain.\n\n**THREAT CLASSIFICATION: 10 — UNFATHOMABLE**\n\nGoosebumps crawled up my spine.\n\nTen?\n\nThat couldn’t be right. Nine was the ceiling.\n\nNine was fucking *god-tier*—reserved for time-feeders and dream-slaughterers and everything locked behind reinforced reality.\n\nBut this… Ten meant unfileable. Unkillable. It meant we didn’t have a word for what it was, only a prayer for what it *might not* be.\n\nMy hands were ice.\n\nI stared at the page and something inside me *shrank.*\n\nIs this what the Jack meant? I had an hour to write my ending, and if I failed, the Order wouldn’t just kill me—they’d feed me to *this.*\n\nThis *Joker.*\n\nThis rogue Overseer.\n\nThis impossible, uncontainable, unshuffled thing.\n\nI laughed. Short. Ragged. Ugly.

As soon as she walked in the door, I nearly assaulted her, shouting in her face everything that happened. “I could have died!” I whined as I followed her to her office.\n\n“You wouldn’t have *died*. You would’ve still been alive, inside your body, just, not… in control of things.”\n\n“That’s even worse!”\n\n“I’m sorry. I never should have brought you here.” She shook her head, then looked up at me. Her eyebrows knotted. “Wait, what’s that?”\n\n“This?” I asked, pointing to the scratch below my eye. “That’s when the demon-poltergeist thing tried to gouge my eyes out with a knife.”\n\nShe paled. “Which knife exactly?”\n\n“Uh…”\n\n“Nadia, this is *important.* Which knife?!”\n\n“Wait.” My heart began to pound. “You’re not—are you saying—the knife is an entity?!”\n\n“*Everything in this store is an entity!”* she shouted, before getting up and hurrying out of the office.\n\n*I should’ve thought of that. Of course… if I’d grabbed anything with a price tag on it, it was an entity. Of course.*\n\n*Oh, no.*\n\nShe came back with two knives. The first was what appeared to be a chef’s knife, though the edge was browned with rust. The second was a thin dagger, possibly a letter opener—not the one from Aunt Gigi’s office, that we’d stabbed Entity #099 with.\n\nShe set them on the desk before me.\n\n“Which one, Nadia?”\n\n“That one,” I said, pointing to the letter opener.\n\n“Fuck. Fuck, fuck, *fuck.”* She buried her head in her hands.\n\n“What?!”\n\nWithout a word, she hurried past me into the shop. She came back, holding the manual, frantically flipping through it. Without a word, she plopped it down in front of me.\n\n*Entity #047*\n\n*Class IV*\n\n*Presentation: An ornate letter opener, with a silver blade and an obsidian hilt.

And it’s not really quite that different, the Shadow World. It’s actually superimposed on this world, so you’ll be in the same location and see all of us, even, you just won’t be able to interact—”\n\n“How long?!”\n\n“It’s dependent on how much of the blade was in contact with your blood, and for how long. My guess is just a few hours. Although, it may feel… a *bit* longer… for you.”\n\n“A bit longer? Days? Weeks? Months?” I spat. “*Years?!”*\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\nBut I could see the transformation already taking place. I hadn’t noticed it before, but the edges of my vision had become… desaturated. Like beyond a certain point, the world was black and white. And smudged, like paint. I blinked, rubbed my eyes, and whirled around. The effect didn’t go away.\n\n“I can see it,” I told her. “My peripheral vision’s black and white.”\n\nShe gave me a sad look.\n\nI ran out of the office to find Kira. I told her everything. She began to cry. “What if you die in there?” she asked, her voice wavering. “Do you die out here, too?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\nShe wrapped me in a hug. “This isn’t fair. Your aunt sucks.”\n\n“I know. I think we should quit, maybe.”\n\n“That would probably be for the best.”\n\nWhen I opened my eyes again, half of my vision was in black and white. I could see Kira’s rosy cheeks and pink sweater, but everything outside of my central vision was smudgy and gray. I noticed movement now, too: figures walking to and fro in the darkness, smudges of white, flitting back and forth.\n\nLike ghosts. Spirits.\n\n“Will they hurt me?” I called to Aunt Gigi.\n\nShe didn’t turn around.\n\nAnd then I realized. Kira was screaming. Her mouth was open in an O, but there was no sound. “Kira?” I shouted. “*Kira!”*\n\nNo one reacted.\n\nI whirled around, at the specters flitting around the edges of my vision. As soon as I looked at them, they disappeared. Like staring at a dim star. Only seeing it indirectly.\n\n*Fuck.*\n\nKira and Aunt Gigi were clearly moving in slow-motion. Maybe half-speed, maybe less. I frantically ran around the shop, screaming for help. Nothing. I ran out onto the sidewalk. I cried for help. The people walking around didn’t even give me a glance.\n\nThen I felt a hot, searing pain in my arm. I yanked back—to see, for a second, a ghostly man looming over me. His skin was light gray and his eyes were dark, sunken pits, staring deep into my soul. As soon as I looked directly at him, he disappeared.\n\nBut I could still feel the pain shooting up my arm, from where he held tight to my arm. He was still there—just invisible to my central vision.\n\nI yanked and flailed and struggled away. I fell right into the street. An SUV barreled towards me and I screamed—but the car passed right *through* me.\n\nI was a ghost.\n\nI ran back into the shop. Paced around, arm still pulsing with pain. When I tried to touch anything, my hand went right through it. Like it was an illusion. I stood in front of the antique suit of armor that Aunt Gigi kept at the back of the store. Extended my arm through its chest. My arm went through the thick metal, through the cavity, and out the other side.\n\nActually. The cavity wasn’t empty. I could feel pulsating warmth under the cold iron of the chest plate. I shivered and yanked my hand back out, heart pounding.\n\n*Holy shit.*\n\nOkay, so the suit of armor was an entity. I should’ve known that. That shouldn’t have been a surprise. Kira and I had gone over the manual, but there were almost a thousand entities, so we’d skipped quite a bit.\n\nI took a deep breath—actually, it wasn’t a breath. I couldn’t breathe here. But I felt my chest puff up as *if* I were taking a breath.\n\nI stared at the suit of armor.\n\nAnd then I realized it was faintly glowing.\n\nThere was a faint, gold glow around the entire suit. I glanced around—and realized every item, every entity for sale, in the shop was faintly glowing gold. The dresses on the rack. The books on the shelf. The rocking chair in the corner. The vintage music box on the table. They were all glowing, faintly, colors of gold and purple and scarlet.\n\nI wandered back towards Kira and Aunt Gigi. Kira was sobbing. Aunt Gigi was comforting her. I stood next to them, wrapping my arms around them, but of course they couldn’t feel me. I didn’t know Kira was such a crier. It was touching.\n\nI stepped back.\n\nAnd then I noticed something.\n\nThere was a sickly green glow coming from Aunt Gigi’s chest.\n\n*What the…*\n\nI leaned in. She was wearing a necklace of some kind, and it was glowing green. It was a pendant of some kind. Hidden under her cardigan, which was buttoned up to the neck.\n\nMy brain started and stuttered a few times as the pieces fell into place.\n\nAunt Gigi… was *wearing* an Entity.\n\nAnd she was purposely hiding it.\n\nHours passed. Kira went home. Then Aunt Gigi. I was left all alone in the dark shop, nothing more but a ghost. At least the other ghosts didn’t seem to bother me here. Maybe they respected that this was *my* space.\n\nI came to at 2:37 AM, lying on the floor, my entire body convulsing like I’d just touched a live wire.\n\nI ran to the bathroom and puked my guts out.\n\nI grabbed my phone to call Kira, my parents, to tell them I was okay—but then I realized, I wasn’t sure I wanted them to know I was back.\n\nHow much did Aunt Gigi know about the Shadow World?\n\nDid she know that I knew she was wearing an Entity?\n\nSo I walked to the 24\/7 convenience store, bought an enormous Slurpee, and walked back into the thrift shop.

Check.\n\n*Pants and shirt*. Check.\n\n*Flashlights*. Check.\n\n“Yes sir, we do.”\n\n“Good, now we wait.”\n\nWade had told me about this ‘ritual’ of sorts a few months back. He, or at least the people on the forum he discovered it from, call it the ‘Inhabitant Ritual.’ \n\nHe wasn’t exactly able to explain it in the best way himself, so he sent me a link to the forum where he read it from. The rules for the ritual are as follows.\n\n1.      You need a minimum of two people for this ritual, if it’s just one person, then it won’t work. Why? That will be explained later.\n\n2.      You need four total items: a needle for every person participating, a shirt and pants, and a flashlight for every person participating.\n\n3.      You need a mannequin; this will be your vessel. The ritual is to summon the spirit Incola (Inhabitant in Latin).\n\n4.      The ritual needs to be performed at night, specifically around the hours of 10:30 PM to 12 AM. If it is done any earlier or any later, then it will not work.\n\n5.      Gather all participants and put the mannequin in a spacious area. It will need the room to adjust to its new body. Next, place the shirt and pants on the mannequin. This is done simply to make it easier to distinguish.\n\n6.      Prick all five fingertips on one hand, rub your hands together so that your entire palm is covered in blood, and leave a handprint on the mannequin’s face. The mannequin is the vessel for the spirit, and the blood creates a bridge between our world and the spirit world.\n\n7.      You need only to say this once. When you’re finished applying the handprint, say this single sentence; “Incola, come forth into our world and take control of the vessel we have prepared for you. Sedecim Nonaginta-Septem.” The words at the end translate to “Sixteen Ninety-Seven,” the year the first reported sighting of Incola occurred.\n\n8.      Once you’ve finished step seven, leave the room and go to the opposite end of the house you’re doing the ritual in. Wait 10 minutes. The very second the clock marks 10 minutes from the time you got into the room, turn your flashlights on.\n\n9.      Incola has now taken hold of the vessel you prepared. Incola is a vengeful spirit and will actively seek to harm you. You need only to survive 90 minutes in the house with it. If you are caught by Incola, the mannequin will be cast aside, and your body will instead be taken and used as a vessel. You need two people because if one dies, the other can stop the ritual by saying “Incola, Dormi Nunc.” (Inhabitant, Sleep Now). When the vessel is asleep, you can wash the blood off and the bridge will be severed, sending Incola back to the spirit world.\n\n10.  Good luck.\n\nThe rules seemed very straightforward. I figured it was simple enough that even a couple idiots like me and Wade could manage to get a good scare out of it without fucking it up.\n\nI wish we had fucked it up.\n\nAt the time we decided to do the ritual, I, a recent high school graduate, was working at our local thrift store. I wouldn’t exactly call it a dead-end job, but it certainly wouldn’t hold if I lived on my own.\n\nAnyways, since we have clothes, we need things to put them on. As a result of this, the building has a small room in the back dedicated solely to the storing of mannequins. I figured my boss wouldn’t notice if I snuck one out.\n\nGetting it home wasn’t too difficult, as I was able to lay it out across the back seat of my car. What was difficult, though, was finding the time to actually do the ritual.\n\nBoth of my parents worked at different times. This meant that most days, one of them was home at any given moment. I was thinking of a way to get them out of the house when my mom announced some news.\n\nApparently, her and my dad had been invited to go to dinner on Saturday night by some family friends. I obviously declined the invitation, claiming that I “didn’t want to ruin dinner with my presence.” They bought it, and that was that.\n\nSo began the plans for the ritual. I had a shift Saturday evening, but it was only 5-9:30, so it would give me time to prepare when I got home. Wade was working from 10-6, so he was fine as well. I told him that he could let himself in and get everything in place for when I got home.\n\n“So, what will I do in the meantime, then?”\n\n“Hmm. I’ve got the PlayStation in my room; you could entertain yourself with that.”\n\n“Sweet. Thanks man.”\n\nMy shift was boring. Usually, we didn’t have customers during the evening, and I questioned why I was even here at all if nobody else was going to show up. I pushed those thoughts to the back of my head and brought ones of my paycheck and the ritual forward.\n\nI was going to get some good scares tonight, and I was going to get paid tomorrow. Alls well that ends well. By the time the clock struck 9:30 PM, I was more than eager to punch out and head home.\n\nI decided to call Wade as I was driving.\n\n“Hey man. Out of work now, headed your way.”\n\n“Okay, should I be ready when you get back?”\n\n“Nah, not for a bit, at least. We’ll have a solid 30 minutes to do whatever we want before we start the ritual.”\n\n“Okay, see you soon.”\n\nMy house is a 15-minute drive from work, so it was about 9:45 by the time I got home. Wade was waiting for me on the couch in the living room, watching some movie on the big screen T.V. When he saw me walk through the front door, he got up and asked me a question.\n\n“You got anything good to eat? Supermarket doesn’t exactly give me free dinners, and my wallet is running on empty right now.”\n\n“Dude, I just got home.”\n\nAfter getting settled back in, I popped a frozen pizza into the oven, and we ate that.\n\nBy the time we had finished eating, it was 10:17 Time to get started.\n\nWe moved the couch to the corner of the living room so there would be an open space for the mannequin. Speaking of which, I brought it down from my room.\n\nIt was already clothed, so we didn’t need to worry about that. Wade had the needles and flashlights. He handed me one of both.\n\n“Hope you like needles.” He winced as he began to prick his fingers.\n\n“I’m going to have to try.” I said, doing the same.\n\nInstead of rubbing our palms. We just scrunched up our hands and that worked too.\n\nI placed my palm on the mannequin's head. Then, Wade did the same.\n\n“You ready to say it?” I asked, wiping my hand off.\n\n“Yeah.”\n\nWe both looked at the mannequin, and at the same time, said the words.\n\n “Incola, come forth into our world and take control of the vessel we have prepared for you. Sedecim Nonaginta-Septem.”\n\nBy now, it was 10:20, so we got up and went to the opposite end of my house.\n\n \n\n“You think it worked?” Wade asked, playing a game on his phone.\n\n“Guess we’ll find out in a few minutes.” It was now 10:27\n\n10:30.\n\nThe clock struck 10:30. Was there ever an indication that the ritual worked? Wade and I determined that the only way to find out was to go back to the point of origin.\n\nAs we trekked through the house, it seemed a lot noisier than usual. Like someone was upstairs. I brushed it off. We were focused on one thing. And then, we saw what was in the living room.\n\nOkay, well, it was more like we *didn’t* see what was in the living room.\n\n \n\nThe mannequin wasn’t there.\n\nThe game had *finally* begun.\n\n "},"17":{"title":"No matter what you hear, no matter what they tell you, \"FireFly\" isn't a new rideshare application.

Instead, there was an exquisitely sharp pain, like the bite of a tattoo needle, followed quickly by the pressure of fluid building underneath my skin.\n\nShock left me momentarily stunned, which gave him enough time to make an exit. Darius clicked the safety belt, threw his backpack over his shoulders, opened the rear door, and tumbled out of my sedan.\n\nI watched the man cascade over the asphalt through the rearview mirror, hopelessly mesmerized. The stunt looked orderly and painless, bordering on elegant. He was on his feet and brushing himself off within the span of a few seconds. Before long, Darius vanished from view, swallowed by the thick blackness of midnight Appalachia.\n\nI crashed back to reality. He vanished because my car was, of course, still barreling down the road at about twenty-five miles an hour.\n\nMy head swung forward and my eyes widened. Fear exploded in my throat. I slammed my foot on the brake and braced for impact.\n\nHeadlights illuminated a rapidly approaching blockade. A veritable junkyard of cars, thirty or forty different vehicles, haphazardly arranged in front of a steep cliff face. The FireFly app had concealed the wall. Instead, the map showed a road that stretched on for miles, with my ex-passenger’s *“destination”* listed as said cliff face.\n\nBut it wasn’t his destination.\n\nIt was mine.\n\nThe tires screeched and burned, and the scent of molten rubber coated the inside of my nose.\n\nToo little, too late.\n\nThe last thing I remember was the headlights starting to flicker, painting a sort of strobe-like effect over the empty SUV I was about to T-bone. Same with the dashboard, which glimmered *11:52 PM* as my car’s battery abruptly died.\n\nThere was a split-second snapshot of motion and sound: my forehead crashing into the steering wheel, the high-pitched grinding of steel tearing through steel, raw terror skittering up my throat until it found purchase directly behind my eyes.\n\nThen, a deep, transient nothingness.\n\nWhen I regained consciousness, it was quiet. An eerie green-blue light bathed the inside of my wrecked car.\n\nI wearily lifted my head from the steering wheel and spun around, woozy, searching for the source of the light. When I turned my head to the right, the brightness shifted in tandem, but I didn’t see anything. Same with left. I performed a complete, three-hundred and sixty degree swivel, and yet I couldn’t find it.\n\nLike the source of the light was stuck to the back of my neck.\n\nI raised a trembling, bloody hand to the rearview mirror and twisted it. Right where the passenger had injected me with something, exactly where I had experienced that initial, exquisite pain, my skin had ballooned and bubbled, forming a hollow dome about the size of a baseball.\n\nAnd there was something drifting around inside. A handful of little blue-green sprites. A group of incandescent beetles giving off light unlike anything I’d ever seen before, caged within the fleshy confines of my new cyst.\n\nFireflies.\n\nI scrambled to find my phone. The impact had sent it flying off my dashboard stand and into the backseats. Thankfully, it wasn’t broken. I reached backwards, grabbed it, and pushed the screen to my face.\n\nA notification from the FireFly app read:\n\n*“Hello Maisie! Please proceed to the following location before sunup.*\n\n*Careful: you now have a target on your back. PLEASE, DO NOT TRY TO BREAK WITHOUT PROPER MEDICAL SUPERVISION.*\n\n*And remember:*\n\n*Bee to a blossom, moth to the flame;*\n\n*Each to his passion, what’s in a name?”*\n\n\\- - - - -\n\nAfter concluding that my car’s battery had gone belly-up out of nowhere, I crawled out of the wreckage through the passenger’s side. The driver’s side door was too mangled for use, nearly embedded within the vacant SUV.\n\nI took a few steps, inspecting my body for damage or dysfunction. Found myself unexpectedly intact. A few cuts and bruises, but nothing life threatening.\n\nExcluding whatever was growing on the back of my neck.\n\nThe messages didn’t explicitly *say* it was life-threatening, but I mean, it was a cavernous tumor brimming with insects that sprouted from the meat along my spine, cryptically labeled a “*target on my back*”.\n\nCalling it life-threatening felt like a fair assumption.\n\nI paced back and forth aside my car, attempting to keep my panic at a minimum. The sight of the vehicular graveyard I crashed into certainly wasn’t helping.\n\nWhatever was happening to me, I wasn’t the first, and I didn’t find that comforting.\n\nMy hands fell to my knees. I folded in half. My breaths became ragged and labored. It felt like I was forcing air through lungs filled with hot sand.\n\nIt took me a moment, but I found a modicum of composure. Held onto it tight. Eventually, my panting slowed.\n\nThere was only one thing to do: just had to choose a direction and walk.\n\nSo, I forced my legs to start moving back the way I came. Figured the rest of the plan would come in time.\n\nThe night was quiet, but not exactly silent.\n\nThere was the soft tapping of my sneakers against the road, the on-and-off whispering of the wind, and a third noise I couldn’t quite identify. A distant, almost imperceptibly faint thrumming was radiating from somewhere within the forest. A sound like the hovering propeller beats of a traveling drone.\n\n*Whatever it is,* I thought, *I’m getting closer to it, because it’s getting louder.*\n\nWhich, in retrospect, was only partially right.\n\nI was moving closer to it, yes, but it was also moving closer to me.\n\nAnd it wasn’t just an *it.*\n\nIt was a *them.*\n\n\\- - - - -\n\nAfter thirty minutes of walking, my car and the cliff face were longer visible behind me. I glanced down at my phone. For better or worse, I was proceeding in the direction that was recommended by the FireFly app.\n\nI was certainly ambivalent about obeying *their* directive. So far, though, the app had me following the road back the way I came, and I knew that led to the nearest city. Seemed like a safe choice no matter what. Also, it didn’t feel smart to dive into the evergreens and the conifers that besieged the asphalt on all sides just to avoid doing what the app told me to.\n\nNot yet, at least.\n\nThere wasn’t a star hanging in the sky. Cloud cover completely obscured any guidance from the firmament. The road didn’t have streetlights, either. Under normal circumstances, I suppose that navigating through the dark would have been a problem. There wasn’t *anything* normal about that night, though. Darius, if that was his real name, had made damn sure of that.\n\nI mean, I had a fucking lantern growing out of my neck like some kind of landlocked, human-angular fish hybrid.\n\nIt had been only my second week driving for Firefly. I contemplated whether my previous customers had been real or paid actors. Maybe a few fake rides was a necessary measure to lull drivers into a false sense of normalcy and security, leading up to whatever all this was. Sure had worked wonders on me.\n\nThe sight of something in the distance pulled me from thought.\n\nI squinted. My cancerous glow revealed the shape of a small building. I recognized it: an abandoned gas station. I noted it on the way up. It was a long shot, but I theorized that it may have a functional landline. Despite my phone having signal, calls to 9-1-1 weren’t connecting.\n\nWith the ominous thrumming still swirling through the atmosphere, I raced forward, hope swelling in my chest. As I approached, however, my pace stalled. A new, sickly-sweet aroma was becoming progressively more pungent. Revulsion pushed back against my momentum.\n\nAbout twenty feet from the building, he finally became visible. I stopped entirely, transfixed in the worst way possible.\n\nThe gas station was little more than a lone fuel pump accompanied by a single-roomed shack. Between those two modest structures, laid a body. Someone who had fallen stomach first with his right arm outstretched, reaching desperately for the shack’s door which was only inches away from his pleading fingers, a cellphone still tightly clutched in his left hand.\n\nThere was a crater of missing flesh at the base of his neck. The edges were jagged. Eviscerated by teeth or claws. It looked like something had mounted his back, pinned him to the ground, and bore into that specific area with frenzied purpose.\n\nIt couldn’t have been a coincidence.\n\nThis corpse had been my predecessor, and he hadn’t been dead for more than a day.\n\nMaybe he was the owner of the SUV.\n\nNausea stampeded through my abdomen. The dead man’s entire frame buzzed with jerky movement - the fitful dance of hungry rot flies. The deep blood-reds and the foaming gray-pinks of his decay mixed with the turquoise glow emanating from my neck to create a living hallucination: a stylized portrait depicting the coldest ravines of hell and a tortured soul trapped therein.\n\nThe ominous thrumming broke my trance. It had become deafening.\n\nI looked up.\n\nThere was something overhead, and it was descending quickly.\n\nI bolted. Past the gas pump. Past the corpse. My hand ripped the door open, and I nearly fell inside the tiny, decrepit shop.\n\nThe door swung with such force that it rebounded off its hinges. On its way back, the screen tapped my incandescent boil. It didn’t slam into it. Honestly, it barely grazed the top of the cyst.\n\nDespite that, the area erupted with electric pain. An unending barrage of volcanic pins that seemed to flay the nerves from my spine.\n\nI’ve given birth to three kids. The first time without an epidural.\n\nThat pain was worse. Significantly, significantly worse. Not even a contest, honestly.\n\nI muffled a bloodcurdling shriek with both hands and kept moving. There was a single overturned rack of groceries in the store and a wooden counter with an aged cash register on top. I limped forward, my lamentations dying down as the thrumming became even louder, ever closer.\n\nThe app’s singular warning chimed in my head.\n\n*Careful: you have a target on your back*\n\n*Bee to a blossom.*\n\n*Moth to the flame.*\n\nI needed to hide the glow.\n\nI raced around the counter. There was a small outcove under the cash register half-filled with newspapers and travel brochures. I swept them to the floor and squatted down, edging my growth into the compartment, careful to not have it collide with the splintered wood.\n\nAnother scream would have surely been the end. They were too close.\n\nRight before my head disappeared under the counter, I saw them land through the window.\n\nThree of them. Winged and human-shaped. Massive, honey combed eyes.\n\nI focused. Spread my arms across the outcove to block the glow further. I couldn’t see them. Couldn’t tell if they could see me, either. Panic soared through my veins like a fighter jet. My legs burned with lactic acid, but I had to remain motionless.\n\nThe thrumming stilled. It was replaced with bouts of manic clicking against a backdrop of the trio’s heavy, pained wheezing. They paced around the front of the building, searching for me.\n\nMy hips began to feel numb. I stifled a whimper as something sharp scraped against the door.\n\nTime creeped forward. It was likely no more than a few minutes, but it felt like eons came and passed.\n\nMoments before my ankles gave in, nearly liquefied by the tension, the thrumming resumed. Deafening at first, but it slowly faded.\n\nOnce it was almost inaudible, I let myself slump to the floor.\n\nI sobbed, discharging the pain and the terror as efficiently as I could. The release was unavoidable, but it had to be brief. My phone was on nine percent battery, and it was only two hours till sunup.\n\nWhen the tears stopped falling, I realized that I needed a way to suppress the glow. Mask my prescence from *them*.\n\nMy eyes landed on the newspapers and plastic brochures strewn across the floor.\n\n\\- - - - -\n\nI went the rest of the night without encountering any of those *things*.\n\nWhile in the gas station, I fashioned a sort of cocoon over my growth to conceal the light. Inner layers of soft newspaper covered by a single expanded plastic brochure that I constructed with tape. I manually held the edges of the cocoon taut with my fingers as I made my way towards the destination listed on the FireFly app.\n\nIt didn’t completely subdue the glow, and it certainly wasn’t sturdy, but it would have to do in a pinch.\n\nI walked slowly and carefully, grimacing when the newspaper created too much friction against the surface of the growth, eliciting another episode of searing pain that caused me to double over for a moment before continuing. I followed the road, but stayed off to the side so I could get some additional light suppression from the canopy.\n\nThe thrumming never completely went silent, and whenever it became louder than a distant buzz, I would stop and wait in the brush, hyper-extending my neck to further blot out the beacon fused to my skin.\n\nAs dawn started to break, I noticed two things. There were open metal cages in the treetops, and there was someone on the horizon.\n\nDarius.\n\nHe was slouched on a cheap, foldable beach chair in the middle of the road, smoking a cigarette, legs stretched out and resting on top of his backpack.\n\nI crept towards him. He was flipping through his phone with earbuds in. The absolute nonchalance he exuded converted all of my residual terror and exhaustion into white-hot rage.\n\nWhen I was only a few feet away, his blue eyes finally moved from the screen. His brow furrowed in curious disbelief. Then came the revolting display of casual elation.\n\nHe jumped from the chair, arms wide, grinning like an idiot.\n\n*“My God! Maisie! Unbelievable! Against forty to one odds, here you are! With, like, ten minutes to spare, I think. You’re about to make one Swedish pharmaceutical CFO who really knows how to pick an underdog very, very happy…”*\n\nHe chuckled warmly. The levity was quickly interrupted by a gasp.\n\n*“Oh shoot! Almost forgot. Gotta send the kids to bed.”*\n\nDarius then put his attention back to his phone, tapping rapidly. Out of nowhere, a shrill, high-pitched noise started emanating from within the forrest. The mechanical wail startled me, and that was the last straw.\n\nI lost control.\n\nBefore I knew it, I was sprinting forward, knuckles out in front of me like the mast on a battleship.\n\nI’m happy they connected with his jaw. More than happy, actually. Ecstatic.\n\nUnfortunately, though, he didn’t go down, and as I was recovering from my haymaker, Darius was unzipping his backpack.\n\nI turned, ready to continue the assault.\n\nThere was a sharp pinch in my thigh, and the world began to spin.\n\nTo his credit, I think he caught me as I started to fall.\n\n\\- - - - -\n\nWhen my eyes fluttered open, I was home, laying in bed, and the room was nearly pitch black. Once the implications of that detail registered, I shot out from under the covers and ran to the bathroom. I inspected the base of my neck through the mirror. No boil. Only a reddish circle where the growth *used* to be.\n\nI peered out my bedroom window, cautiously moving the blinds like I was expecting those thrumming, humanoid creatures to be there, patiently waiting for me to make myself known.\n\nThere was a new car parked in my driveway, twenty times nicer than my old sedan. Otherwise, the street was quiet.\n\nI spun around, eyes scanning for my phone. I found it laying on my desk in its usual place, charged to one-hundred percent.\n\nThere was a notification from the FireFly App.\n\n*“Congratulations, Maisie!*\n\n*You’ve qualified for a promotion, from ‘driver’ to ‘handler’. As stated in the fine-text of your sign-on contract, said promotion is mandatory, and refusal will be met with termination.*\n\n*Please reach out to another ex-driver, contact information provided on the next page. They are a veteran handler and will be on-boarding you.*\n\n*We hope you enjoy the new car!*\n\n*Sincerely,*\n\n*Your friends at Last Lighthouse Entertainment.”*\n\nI clicked forward. My vision blurred and my heart sank.\n\n*“Darius,* [*contact # \\[xxx-xxx-xxxx\\]”*](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/unalloyedsainttrina\/)"},"18":{"title":"I’m the Only One Who Remembers What Happened Inside That Cracker Barrel on Truant Drive","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kb76nq\/im_the_only_one_who_remembers_what_happened\/","flair":null,"author":"seeacois","selftext":"I don’t remember what I ate, or how we got there—but I remember what it felt like when the walls started moving.\n\nA table cluttered with reheated carbs and wet meat laid in front of me. The oak-boarded walls framed my parents as they shoveled their gullets full of the nutrient-lacking buffet. The ambience of Cracker Barrel has always unsettled me. The feigned laughter among a table full of reunited coworkers rings in my head while restless cars in the parking lot endlessly blind the patrons within. The gift shop blares corporate country music to soothe the part of the customer that wants to flee. Indulgence at every corner.\n\nThrough the slats in the blinds, our car sat in the heat like a sun-bleached insect. The windshield pulsed faintly in the light, but nothing inside stirred. I looked back into the room. Crossed canoe oars—too clean to be real—hung beneath a framed salmon print on office paper, yellowed slightly like everything else.\n\nFor a moment I believed I saw a plant sitting on a shelf, but a squint of my eyes revealed it to be a photograph of a plant on a shelf. I redirected my confusion to the complimentary peg game provided for all guests. My prize for winning was an unenthusiastic refill for my water. Looking back toward the shelf, I felt that aside from the misleading and corporate subject matter, this photograph felt wrong. It felt like the longer I gazed upon it, the larger it became. It was getting larger. No, it was closing in on me. The whole wall with it.\n\nAll of the walls were inching in on themselves. The foot gap between the back of my family’s chairs and the wall was now a contact point moving toward the table. Looking around, I noticed that the herds hadn’t even noticed their space was being cramped. The employees were watching the clock, eyes glazed over, waiting for their shift to end. The servers began squeezing between tables to refill empty glasses, their smiles never dropping.\n\nPanicked, I stood up. My head hit a sloppily assembled deer antler chandelier. I didn’t have to look up very far to see that the ceiling dropped significantly faster than the walls had closed in. If I didn’t leave I would suffocate.\n\nThere was no clear route to the main entrance. Hunched backs were now wrestling with one another for space. Compressed waitresses walked on tables to navigate from the slaughterhouse to the tables. Confused wet hands grabbed at anything with glaze.\n\nI crawled up onto my table with only enough room to crouch, my parents looking at me with irresponsible eyes. Beginning the cramped shuffle off of my table to the next, I notice that the shoulder to shoulder crowd is unable to keep up with the replenishing feast in front of them. An elderly man’s solution was to remove his dentures to make more room for his commercial hash browns. As if following the teachings a prophet, the mass of gluttonous maws lodged silverware between gum and tooth, prying them loose.. The insatiable static consumed minutely faster, unimpeded by the hindrances they’d been born with.\n\nIn the time I observed this orthodontic suicide, the ceiling pushed me down to my knees. The walls closed in until the tables were packed so tightly, no light could pass through underneath. I crawled as quickly as I could, using the eating heads as a grip to pull myself away from the strong hooves pulling me back.\n\nThe gift shop was all that stood between myself and the exit, but the passageway to it was shrinking rapidly. The splintered arch, leading to the gift shop, was at most a foot tall. While I had enough room to crawl on the tables, I would have to lay on my stomach and squeeze myself through the passageway. I began by forcing my body into downward dog and slipped my head and arms through the hole. The gift shop greeted my upper half with an artificial spruce scent. Using what limited movement I could manage, I forced my shoulders and rib cage through to the jolly menagerie of knickknacks.\n\nThe gate constricted even more, clutching my waist. Adrenaline and fear consumed me as the nagging chewing and swallowing behind me turned to low moans. I pulled myself against the splintered frame, my skin giving before the sharp wood did. A happy collection of price points welcomed my full form on the other end. A corporate pop song is playing softly as compression causes the products on display to crash onto lower shelves. Among these products is a carved black bear with the eyes of the employer. It’s imperfect eyes jealous of my mobility.\n\nBehind me, I heard my parents’ voices among the visceral shrieks signaling crushed spines or out-of-reach food. The cries flooded through the shattered front window, chasing my intended escape.\n\nBlinded by urgency, I rushed through the gift shop.. The licensed childhood heroes pasted on the overpriced shirts appeared to be weeping. The cashier just finished clipping her nails and was on her third quality check, ensuring they looked perfect. That same plant photograph seen in the dining area also for sale, but its price wasn’t written in numbers. The squeals now intensified and were harmonizing with the guttural bubbling of forced wet air.\n\nUpon exiting, I collapsed onto the compressed soil where the foundation of the building used to be. Adrenaline made me both unable to stand and incapable of resting. I crawled until my palms felt asphalt nearly 25 feet away. I rolled over and scanned the restaurant I was in moments prior and the establishment was now the size of the car my family drove here in.\n\nAs the building continued to compress, the sounds of impossibly loud contortions and collisions filled the air. The screams were quickly replaced by the sounds of dozens of tables dryly imploding to fill the space of a single chair. The smaller the building got, the louder the sounds became. I got to my feet and stammered to the car, too preoccupied to realize the keys were left inside the restaurant.\n\nIt wasn’t until the spectacle shrunk down to the size of a pack of gum that the noise went completely mute. It was as if every last particle of human and furnishings in there found equilibrium. \n\nDespite the lull in the air, the wet crushing and consumption continued in my head. The visions overwhelmed my mind, constrained by my capacity to process them, as if my very psyche was an echo of the morbid devastation that took place moments before\n\nWhen it was all over, I clearly heard birds chirping ignorantly. It was a strangely beautiful day.\n\n\n\nFifteen years have passed since then. I now stand here at the site in which it all took place, seeing no evidence of the restaurant’s existence. Dust covered cars litter the overgrown parking lot for an establishment that is no longer here. I don’t know why I came back. Maybe some part of me believes that if I returned, I would find a reason that any of this happened in the first place. Instead I am filled with an indescribable indifference. A hollow restlessness that clouds my ability to ground myself in reality.\n\nMy family’s car is still here. Inside I see my DSi–my parents never let me play it when we went out to eat. In the center console, there’s a large and medium sized cup. My dad must have been driving because the large cup is in the front cup holder. Even from the outside, I swear I can still smell the black ice air freshener hanging from the rear view mirror.\n\nRemoving my hand from the window, I hold no memory of the day that left the interior of the car looking like this, but I can remember every detail of what happened within those shrinking walls. Nobody could have known what would take place in there, but why am I the only one who made it out to the other side? Why do I suddenly remember everybody watching me?\n\nDespite the compounding unanswerable questions, I find comfort in knowing that a part of my life has been sealed away in that car, untouched, preserved in innocence."},"19":{"title":"There's Something Underneath My Basement","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kbaxnk\/theres_something_underneath_my_basement\/","flair":null,"author":"Greedy2112","selftext":"My name is Alex and as I write this, I know it’s only a matter of time before the RCMP find me. And when they do, they're either going to question me about why I burned my house down or take me, probably both honestly.\n\nRight now I’m held up in the nearest hotel, not planning on going anywhere. I have barely slept and I don’t think I'm going to get much more sleep going forward.\n\nThey’re going to want answers and the truth is, I don’t have any good ones, none that makes any sense anyway. Hell, I don’t understand what happened myself. Their gonna think I’m insane or something but they can go look for themselves once the fire dies down and they can look down in that fucking hole in the basement.\n\nBesides, how do I explain to them that I found another house beneath my basement?\n\nIt all started a couple of weeks ago when I found a property for sale while driving around. In this market, you don’t expect to find anything remotely affordable anymore, let alone a full house for $50,000. That alone should’ve raised red flags, but it didn’t. I was too caught up in the price so much that nothing else mattered to me.\n\nThere was no online listing, no real estate agent, nothing. Just an old wooden sign staked in the front yard: *FOR SALE* scrawled in fading red paint, with a phone number beneath it. I called. The man who answered sounded old and told me it was for sale for $50,000. I bought it on the spot and spoke with him a little longer to arrange a day to purchase it.\n\nI should’ve known something was off from the start. But I didn’t, or maybe I did and chose to ignore it. I don’t know anymore.\n\nIt was tucked away near the end of an old, half-forgotten road where barely anyone lived anymore. The distance between each house made fences kind of pointless unless you REALLY needed privacy, just empty land with thin, scattered trees that looked more dead than alive. There were more shadows than people out there somehow.\n\nThe house itself was small. Tiny really, especially by modern standards. A little paperwork, a quick money transfer and suddenly, I was a homeowner. Well “new” owner at least. The place was old and worn, but I didn’t care. It was my house now. \n\nThe man selling it was in his seventies, maybe older. Pale, wrinkled, like someone who hadn’t slept properly in months. He said he was heading to the East Coast to live with his family somewhere in Labrador. He told me his wife had passed away just a few months earlier. Found her one morning in the back garden. Dead, just lying there in the grass. He didn’t say how she died and I didn’t press him for details.\n\nIt wasn’t exactly the comforting image you want burned into your mind when buying a house, but still I had the deed and for the first time in my life, I owned something that wasn’t some shitty apartment I was renting for more than what it was really worth.\n\nThat night I drove over to pick up the keys from him. It was already late well past sunset and the road leading to the house was barely lit. Only a single streetlamp buzzed weakly near the edge of the property, casting just enough light to see the outline of the porch. The rest of the house was drowned in darkness. No lights on inside. Not even a glow from a window, just blackness inside.\n\nThe front door was slightly ajar hanging open like someone had left in a hurry. On the porch, right in front of the doorway the keys were sitting on the ground. No note or anything.\n\nI bent down to pick them up and the moment my fingers touched metal something came rushing out towards me from the house, nearly knocking me to my ass from jumping back so quickly.\n\nIt was the old man.\n\nHe rushed out the front door fast, faster than I thought a man his age could move and walked straight past me without a word. Not even a glance in my direction. He had this wide, unsettling smile stretched across his face like he just did something wrong and got away with it. It was unnerving the way he smiled.\n\nHe didn’t stop either. He didn’t turn back to look at me or anything, just kept walking until he reached the other side of the road and kept walking further and further until he was out of sight in the darkness.\n\nI stood there on the porch, keys in hand, trying to process what I had just watched until I couldn’t see the old man at all. I had no clue what was in that direction at all, an uneasy feeling overtaking me even when I glanced back to the house again with its front door wide open now, the pitch blackness inside haunting in its own way.\n\nWhat got me the most was how tall the old man looked that night. He seemed taller than I remembered him being when we first met, almost unnaturally so. Maybe it was the night playing tricks on me or maybe it was just the sheer unease of that moment, the sight of him rushing past grinning ear to ear in the dark, that had scared me more than anything at the moment when I saw him rushing past me. I never saw him again.\n\nIt took a few days before I was fully moved into the house. There were the usual chores of changing the locks, bringing in the essentials, trying to make the place feel like mine by placing furniture and photo’s everywhere. It may have looked small from the outside, but the house had a deceptive amount of space. Two modest bedrooms, a cramped kitchen, a tight but functional living room, and even a pull-down ladder that led to a shallow attic you had to crouch in to move around. But what really surprised me was the basement. The stairs creaked with each step you took but they led down into a massive, open space about the size of the entire footprint of the house above it. It was dark, musty, and smelled faintly of damp stone and old wood, but it had potential.\n\nLike the rest of the place, it needed work. The exterior was in rough shape, yellow paint flaking off in long strips, roofing shingles cracked and curling in spots, the kind of damage that only years of sun, wind and neglect would do to them over time. Still, with how little I spent on the place I had enough saved to start making improvements. I wanted to build something for myself finally.\n\nIt was only two days ago that everything changed.\n\nIt had been raining hard all day, the kind of steady yet heavy, cold rain that soaks through everything it touched. I was heading down into the basement to grab a toolbox when I noticed nearly two feet of water at the bottom of the staircase.\n\nI looked around for the source, expecting to find a burst pipe or a window left open, but there was nothing I could see that was letting the rain water in.\n\nI scrambled to collect the buckets, pans, even plastic bins, anything I could use to start scooping water into to help fight the rising water. I’d scoop up what I could, run it outside, and toss it far from the house, only for the water level to rise again when I came back. It was a losing battle yet I had to keep trying, the last thing i needed was my entire basement filled with water and reach the top of the staircase..\n\nOn my sixth trip down there, something gave.\n\nAs I was rushing to the bottom of the stairs I heard a sound, a deep, hollow like sound, like wood giving way under pressure. Then, all at once, the water began swirling, spiraling toward the center of the basement like in a sink once the plug was pulled. It drained quickly, all of the water rushing downwards until all of it was gone, leaving behind a single hole dead center in the basement.\n\nIt was no bigger than my fist  right in the middle of the floor. I waited for the last of the water to vanish before approaching it with caution. My first thought was it was an old floor drain. Maybe it had been blocked for years and finally gave way once there was enough water down here, but when I shined my phone’s flashlight into it that idea died pretty quickly.\n\nThere was no pipe, no grating, no rusty metal or broken pipe, just a black void in the center of my basement floor. The dirt and cement around the edges were rough yet round at the same time, maybe a collapse but it was level with the floor somehow.\n\nThe closer I got to it to look, the weirder it started to get.\n\nWith my phone’s flashlight, I could just barely make out what looked like... another floor beneath me, far far below. Was it a second basement? Another room? I had no clue what the hell I was looking at at that moment.\n\nI wanted to know more. I *needed* to. But making the hole bigger was a risky move. If the foundation was as old and brittle as the rest of the house, I could bring the whole damn floor out from under me, hell I could even make the house collapse over me. Okay maybe not that last bit but you get my point.\n\nAt the same time there was absolutely nothing I could do at the time being. The rain water was gone thankfully but until tomorrow no one was going to be swinging by and checking it out for me, not until tomorrow at least.\n\nWorst case scenario, I figured I could grab a piece of plywood, cover the hole, and pour concrete over it, that would seal the damn thing off and pretend it was never there. Not a perfect fix but at least it would keep the basement from collapsing under me…hopefully.\n\nWhen the morning came I stepped outside to inspect the house for any more damage from the storm before finally making my way back down to the basement. I was expecting the hole to still be there. What I wasn't expecting was the hole to be much bigger now overnight.\n\nWhat was once the size of my fist was now easily large enough for a grown man to jump through. No digging or tools required for the job, just a clean, dark opening in the middle of my basement floor. Looking down into it again I could finally confirm what I thought I’d seen the day before, a wooden floor much deeper down then I thought originally. There even seemed to be boxes down there as well\n\nEven if I wanted to go down there the drop was too far. There was no way I’d be able to climb back up if I just jumped down there. Hell I would probably bust my leg up just jumping down there, the only way to safely reach the bottom was with a ladder. So I got one.\n\nI drove to the nearest hardware store and bought the longest extension ladder they had, along with a decent flashlight, something stronger than what my phone's flashlight could handle. When I got back I carefully lowered the ladder into the hole, extending it as far as it would go until it finally touched the bottom. The very top of the ladder barely grazed the stone floor below. If the floor it leaned on gave out while I was climbing down I would for sure fall and probably break something along the way.\n\nI took my time descending step by step, testing each one with my full weight before committing to the next. The moment my feet touched the bottom, I realized how strange the air felt. Warm and dry, too dry for a space underground that had just flooded.\n\nI flicked my flashlight to look around the room, the shape of it was off somehow.\n\nThe wooden walls rose upward at a sharp angle, forming a triangular space that immediately struck me as familiar. I turned slowly as pieces started clicking in my head. “This looks just like my attic” I remember telling myself, only it was taller and almost thinner on the sides in a weird warped kind of way.\n\nEven the boxes down here looked similar to the ones I had in the attic only stretched into more odd shapes. Inside the boxes though was nothing but crumpled up paper and old splintered wood that smelt like they were decaying for a while. It wasn’t long before i spotted the pull down staircase like in my actual house.\n\nI hesitated at first before yanking it free and carefully descended once more, my flashlight flicking around in my hand as I stepped lower and lower into this house under my basement.\n\nThe darkness swallowed  me as I entered the hallway.\n\nI was standing in what looked like my own living room, almost exact to my living room. Same furniture, same shitty worn down rug, the same family photos hanging on the walls. The photos were wrong though, stretched in a way that it was like someone editing them used a tool to stretch them taller and thinner without adjusting them to look right..\n\nThe pictures with myself in them scared me the most.\n\nAll of the photo’s with myself standing in them made me look off in so many ways, it was the only part of any of the pictures that looked proper within them, yet I look monstrous in them. I looked taller but thinner, my eyes wide and a huge grin smeared across my face in an almost impossible way. It scared me a little to look at them.\n\nI moved toward the kitchen, stepping lightly as I did. The air felt still and heavy, it was like no one had been down here in ages yet everywhere I look things I had in my own house were place perfectly where I left them, the kitchen was a perfect sight of this with a plate and fork left in the sink, and a coffee pot left on the counter from this morning. The kitchen was just as distorted, tall counters and oversized cabinets. Two impossibly thin chairs that looked exactly like what I had but scaled like props in some surreal movie scene. I would have had to jump to sit on them and even then I’d probably snap them like twigs from doing it.\n\nThere were windows but instead of letting in light they were filled with dirt and stone, the dirt pressed right up to the glass. No sunlight could reach this far underground, but the lights overhead… they looked intact despite their oddly stretched design.\n\nI stepped to one of the light switches and flicked them up.\n\nFor a split second  the bulbs flashed with an intense light, revealing just how wrong everything was. The sudden light flash made the bulbs pop loudly and killed them in an instant. Within that brief moment of light I thought I saw something at the end of the hallway leading into the living room.\n\nThe light was on and gone so quickly I couldn’t tell what it was, but it was tall, unbelievably tall as it stood there staring at me.\n\nI quickly raised my flashlight down the hallway, the beam bouncing wildly off the walls. I could’ve sworn I saw something, someone even standing there. I froze, heart pounding, eyes locked on the place where it had been as my hands shook holding the flashlight. My mind raced to make sense of it, where the hell it even came from, but it came up empty. Panic started to creep in as I backed into the kitchen counter with my hand blindly searching for anything to use, it landed on the handle of a kitchen knife. It was long and thin, barely more than a glorified machete then a knife, but it was the only thing between me and whatever might be waiting on the other side of the hallway.\n\nI stepped forward slowly, each foot step echoing too loudly on the warped wood. The silence was thick like the house itself was holding its breath as I moved through it. I inched my way to the end of the hallway, ready to fight whatever the hell was over there only to find nothing, nothing at all.\n\nDid my eyes play tricks on me with the sudden flash of light?\n\nI stood there for what felt like forever trying to calm myself, trying to make sense of what I’d seen while searching every inch of the living room for anything at all. There was nothing, nothing except for one more room in this messed up house.\n\nThe basement.\n\nEvery piece of me screamed at me to not go down. God only knows what the hell was waiting for me down there, yet I needed to see now, I had to see what was down there.\n\nI took my time, descending the narrow staircase little by little. I reached the basement floor of the second house and there, right in the center of the basement floor was another hole. And this time a ladder was already in place. Almost identical to the one I had used earlier. As if someone, or something, had placed the same one for me. What if it was there because I placed my ladder to reach down here?\n\nThe hole was much wider than the last one as I stepped closer to it. It was wider yet the attic I was looking into this time was much shorter then this one, maybe shorter than the one I actually owned on top..\n\nThis time though, nearing the edge the smell hit me harder than anything else. The stink of rotting wood and something sour and organic, made my stomach twist and turn a little. I covered my nose with my sleeve and leaned over shining my light into the pit. The space below glistened under the beam. Everything looked wet, drenched in something thick that shimmered like oil.\n\nMaybe this was where the rainwater had drained. But that didn’t make sense, this second house would have soaked it up before it even reached the basement, hell whatever was down there didn’t look like it was soaked in water at all, more slime or mold.\n\nMy curiosity got the best of me as I began climbing down, ignoring every desperate plea my brain tried to make me stop. This house, the third one, was the opposite of the last. Where the second house was tall and thin, this one was short and wide. I had to crawl on all fours just to move around down there and the smell, oh god the smell was so bad. The attic ceiling was pressed downwards, forcing me to crawl to the pulled up staircase before I was free from it.\n\nThe air was thick and wet down here, covering my face was out of the question now with my arms drenched in whatever the hell this was as everything had a thin layer of mold or slime or…whatever the fuck it was, making my steps a little more slippery. I was in the hallway now, forcing me to dip my head slightly to avoid hitting the low ceiling. The walls were stretched outward now, wide and bloated. Warped like something swollen from the inside.\n\nAgain everything was where it should’ve been to the layout of my actual house. My furniture, my photos. But this time the distortion wasn’t just in shape. It was *texture*. The air smelled of mildew and decay. the furniture sagged. The floor squelched slightly beneath my feet and the photos were awful. My face was bloated and discolored. My eyes were barely visible as the bloated parts of my face swelled over them like I was infected by something.\n\nI made my way toward the final staircase, the one leading down to the basement and I heard it.\n\nBreathing.\n\nSlow, ragged, wet, a rattle of the throat like it was trying to clear something deep in its throat.\n\nThe sound grew louder with every step. It wasn’t just breathing, it was struggling with every breath it took like it was trying to stay alive. In a way it sounded like water was lodged in their lungs and every breath rattled it around in a sickening manner.\n\nI descended carefully each step louder than the last, a slight squishing sound to go with them from the mold beneath my feet as I reached the bottom step, seeing the basement floor finally.\n\nSomeone or something was standing there, standing over what looked like another hole dead center to the basement.\n\nIt was hunched, shorter than me for sure. Its back was to me, looming over the other hole in the floor. Its body looked swollen and damp, its skin pale and blotchy, and its head  too big for its frame. The gurgled wheezing echoed off the walls as it shifted slightly.\n\nThen it turned, its step made him jiggle just a little bit.\n\nWhat I saw was…me, but it wasn’t me at the same time.\n\nIts face was bloated and discolored, its eyes were barely visible as the bloated parts of its face swelled over them. Its mouth slack and drool hangs in thick strands from its bloated lips. Its shirt was identical to mine, soaked and clinging to its sticky body, its eyes barely registered my presence at first.\n\n“What the fuck...” I whispered, the words barely escaping my throat as I looked at whatever the hell this was in front of me.\n\nIt let out a sickening noise, a cross between a gargled yell and a cough. Its whole body shuddered before it started to move towards me, moving faster than I expected it to move.\n\nEach step made its bloated skin shake from its footsteps, the bloated parts nearly covering its eyes shifting to its weight and gravity.\n\nMy body told me to run, run and don’t look back, my boots slipping across the slime coated floors as I scrambled up the staircase in a mad panic to get away from it. The gunk clinging to the surfaces and making every step a risk, I could barely keep traction.\n\nI launched myself onto the pull down staircase as fast as I could, dragging myself upward on all fours like a scared animal clawing its way out of a trap. Behind me I heard the wet, slapping sounds of it following, its hand reaching up from the pull down staircase leading to the attic already. I felt fingers swipe at my ankle, slick and sticky but they slid off just as I hauled myself forward and to the hole in the attic\n\nI could hear my own heartbeat ringing in my ears, my body buzzed with adrenaline and a blind panic coursing through every nerve in my body. That thing, that twisted, bloated *version* of me was chasing me and somehow catching up. I didn’t dare to look back, not wanting to see that thing catching up to me in any way.\n\nIf I can get to my actual house and pull the ladder up, I could prevent it from reaching me, no way for it to be able to climb up that distance I hoped. I was in the second house now, out of breath but I could still hear it following me as I raced to the staircase, reaching the hallway once again and climbing up the pull down staircase again. I was nearly out of there as I stood in the attic for a second.\n\nI grabbed the ladder and started to climb like a mad man, reaching only half way up the ladder before I felt its hand grab me by the leg.*.* The entire ladder lurched in my hands, its weight suddenly doubled from the thing joining me on it. It held on to my leg, trying to pull me down with it as I struggled to keep a grip on the latter, my hands still slick with the third floor's slop.\n\nI didn’t stop to fight it. I ran. I sprinted across the attic floor to the next pull-down staircase, yanked it open, and threw myself onto the steps, climbing as fast as my legs would carry me. The wood groaned beneath my weight. My fingers slipped on the wet rungs. I could hear the creature scuttling after me, faster than anything that heavy and bloated should’ve been able to move.\n\nHis hands were cold and rubbery, coated in something viscous that immediately soaked through my jean leg. It yanked hard, trying to drag me back down with it. I tried to pull away, holding on to the ladder the best I could, my other foot flailing around and trying to get back on to one of the steps of the ladder. The thing below snarled, breath bubbling like it was choking on vomit as it finally spoke out words I could understand.\n\n“*Deeper...* DEEPER*!*” it gurgled, its voice broken and wet like it was speaking through a throat full of sludge.\n\n“Get the fuck off me!” I shouted.\n\nI twisted violently trying to break free and kicked down with my free foot aiming blind. I struck the left side of its face, my foot nearly sticking to its face as I raised it up again and brought it down on him again and again.\n\n“Deeper!” It screamed at me before my foot smashed it in the jaw, a loud crack coming from my foot smashing into it again. With one final kick I felt the left side of his face give, almost like a grape being stepped on as the skin cracked open underneath my foot and his grip suddenly loosened as it fell to the floor beneath with a wet splat like a water balloon. The entirety of the left side of its face was broken up, gushing out blood and whatever fluids was stored inside of its body as it poured out around it, its body twitching as it laid on the floor beneath me.Looking down at it, a part of me wanted to make sure it was dead. Instead I pulled myself up into my actual basement, pulling the ladder up with me to make sure nothing else could come climbing up.\n\nI didn’t know what the hell to do. My mind was on fire, spiraling on what I just witnessed, trying to make sense of what I had seen, what I had just killed*.* There were no answers that made any sense, just more questions piling up and clawing at the edge of my sanity. But through the noise, one thought cut through with terrifying clarity. What if something else could crawl up here? It may have been the panic I was in, it might have been the thought of more fucked up versions of me could be lingering down there, but in the end i decided to burn the place down with whatever I had on hand.\n\nIf nothing existed up here then there shouldn’t be anything down there right? It mirrored my home in every way before twisting it and making whatever the hell I just saw down there. It was the only thing that seemed to make sense in my mind at that moment.\n\nI tore through the house grabbing anything flammable. Paper, lighter fluid, cans of spray, I even thought about getting gas from the tank of my car to pour everywhere but I would need it to get the hell out of here. The smell of chemicals filled the air, sharp and burning my throat as I spread everything I had everywhere. I didn’t care about damage or cost or consequence anymore, this house was cursed with things I couldn’t understand\n\nI stood in the center of the living room for a moment as I readied the matches, my fingers trembling to get one of them lit before throwing it down, flames shooting up everywhere very quickly before I rushed out the door.\n\nAs the flames rushed through the house I made my way out the front door that somehow was already wide open. I didn’t remember leaving the front door open at all but I shook that thought out of my head as I ran to the car, igniting the engine to get the hell out of there as flames engulfed the house. I let the house burn behind me, never once looking back at it as I drove as fast and I could out of there like a bat out of hell. Looking back it now I could have done so many different things like call the police and have them see the hole for themselves and whatever fucked up thing was down there waiting for them, but as it stands I could care less now. I should be upset with burning my home down but I don’t, I really don’t after all of that.\n\nI’ve been at this cheap hotel ever since, holed up in a room that smells like old wallpaper and cat piss. I haven’t slept or eaten much, my stomach just turns whenever I think of the third house down there.\n\nMy mind keeps going back to when I found that…thing in the basement, it was looking at another hole dead center of the basement. There was another house down there, maybe more messed up then the third one and who knows how many more beneath that one.\n\nWhat bothered me even more was the fact that the third house had a messed up version of me, was there one for the second floor or did I get lucky? I thought I saw something but I looked everywhere when I was down there and spotted nothing but what if I missed it somehow?\n\nI don’t know. I’ll probably never find out now and honestly, maybe that’s for the best.\n\nAnyway, I’m done writing about this. Just trying to keep my head on  straight while I wait for the RCMP to show up. They will come eventually.\n\nSomeone is knocking on my door so I’m gonna see who it is. Whoever they are, I can see their shadow in the window and they are tall as hell.\n\n"},"20":{"title":"The Kiosk","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kb2ey5\/the_kiosk\/","flair":null,"author":"MWMN19","selftext":"There is a kiosk at the edge of my city, surrounded by old decrepit and barely standing commie-blocks, and just down the main road is the city dump, that is if the smell of the *roosters* or stale milk doesn’t beat it to the punch… I hate those annoying bastards... Just try to imagine the *wonderfu*l smell once the breeze changes course...\n\nI really had no other options. It was either this, university or taking care of my sister who was old enough to take care of herself, and was a better damn cook than I am – or ever will be… She would be the one taking care of me despite being the older sibling. She was always better than me…\n\n Now, I work the nightshift at that kiosk - and the pay is unusually high, my parents don’t believe me when I tell them. But they do think I am much better with my finances than I actually am – not like I spend much either way.\n\nI am mostly at that damn kiosk, home, or you can occasionally find me at the store buying cigarettes or doing some errands on the rare days I am not at work or rotting at home.\n\nThe kiosk is my home, it became my home. Honestly, it is much better than my *actual* home. I am alone and I don’t need to communicate with people beyond – *Good evening* and *Goodbye.* Maybe the occasional small talk with the local drunk which consists of me nodding while the old fart rambles on about conspiracy theories or his own sad life. Kind of makes me thankful for mine, though you never know – I might end up like him in a few decades.\n\n You might be asking yourself – “Now hold on, unusually high pay?” – For those reading this from the first world, I assure you I am not buying myself a Lambo any time soon. But it is more than enough to live a comfortable life.\n\nThe wage is about 2000 dollars a month, when converted from my country’s currency. To give you perspective, that is more than what my parents earn in a month… *Combined*.\n\n Now the second question you ought to have is – “What in the world are you doing there to earn such a wage? And where do I sign up?” – Okay, you’re probably not asking the second question, and honestly even if you do I can’t tell you… I literally can’t for various reasons. It comes to different people in different ways and at different times. But I can tell you how *I* got it.\n\n About three years ago I finally finished school. And my grades were not up to snuff to get into a university, though I could attend one local university just by passing one test exam – I think its called a “prom exam” in English – I really didn’t feel like it. So, my parents gave me the ultimatum. Work or university, and I chose work. Hey, at least I can have my own money, right?\n\nAnd so I started working, first it was a factory job, then security for a short while, I worked as a store clerk for a few months. And then after I was laid off the construction gig my uncle set me up with, which just so happened to be in that part of the city where the kiosk is located…\n\nI really didn’t know where else to go. And as if the powers that be heard my call, I stumbled upon that kiosk. It was closed and an old man was smoking a cigarette outside. And I saw there was a sign on the kiosk –\n\n*“Looking for employee”*\n\nI approached the old man who had the stench alcohol and tobacco surrounding him like an aura… And a hint of stale milk. Let’s call him “Winston” – He likes those cigarettes, smokes only them.\n\n I got the job.\n\nWinston was more than happy to get me onboard for the nightshift… I of course asked for the pay and he told me that it is slightly above minimum wage, which I was fine with. He *did* say there were other bonuses on top of the main pay, but that they vary a lot. I was okay with that too, if any extra comes my way I won’t be complaining.\n\n I worked the day shift first, he showed me the ropes, where everything was, how to treat the customers and so on. Boring shit. The kiosk was rather spacious inside but filled to the brim with all kinds of products and knick knacks. There was even a desk with a lamp in the corner where employees can go and do their own thing…\n\nThe toilet though… I’d rather go piss or shit in the back of the kiosk and let the whole neighborhood see me and let the roosters suck me dry than to touch that fucking door with 10 meter stick, nay, a damn laser…\n\nAgh, I am getting off track, where was I? Ah, yeah, the job itself.\n\nThe boss told me to open up a specific drawer in the desk which was in the back, the one that I mentioned, if a customer comes over during the night and asks for a *number* from 1 to 12. And that I charge them not with money… But *teeth.* Of course I was a bit weirded out by that, but I won’t question it. I worked in construction and saw my fair share of weirdos in this place, so okay, teeth for numbers it is – He also added that the price, or rather the amount of teeth, is written on the bottle. So I charge however much it says on the desired bottle. Bottle of *what?* I don’t wanna know. He just handed me the keys to the drawer and told me not to open it unless there is a customer ordering it.\n\nNow that I think about it I can’t really remember my first shifts, once I got into it… It all blended together. After a while the scratching on the kiosk roof became normal and I don’t know if it’s sleep deprivation or what but I swear to whatever deity rules over this Earth, I can see little people run in between the vodka bottles on the top shelf. *I’ll catch those thieving gnomes eventually…*\n\n Anyway… I’ll tell ya a couple of stories from what I’ve experienced thus far.\n\nI honestly don’t know where to start… What unusual stories do I have… Well, which ones *aren’t* weird to be begin with… I’ll just start with the old drunk.\n\nThere’s this old alcoholic who shows up around 9 or 10 o’clock. He buys a liter of vodka, a pack of gum, and on the rare occasions when he’s treating himself, a pack of cigarettes. Other times he begs me to lend him a few of my own.\n\nLet’s just call him “Smirnoff” – you can guess why – Now Smirnoff looks like your average hobo. Balding with long strands of white hair, a beard like steel wool and teeth so yellow that you could mistake it for gold and clothes that look like they’ve been in the dump since ‘89. And of course he hasn’t seen a shower or soap since the fall of the Iron Curtain.\n\n I don’t even need the lights to see his face to know its him when I open that little window after the first few knocks – *I can smell the old fart.*\n\nHe’d always ramble about some weird shit they’d be building down the road. I worked there and I knew it was just some new office building or some shit.\n\nNothing strange about that. But he’d always insist they’re building some sort of cultist get-together spot where they’d sacrifice babies to some ancient sleeping God… He’d also ramble about fairies and how aliens are to blame for his alcohol addiction. Or was it fairies? I dunno.\n\nHe was a regular, as you’d imagine, so I knew the spiel he’d go on every time. Sometimes he’d go at it for 10 minutes, and the longest was almost a whole damn hour. It got to a point I wanted to get out of the kiosk and shoo him away…\n\nBut I can’t really go out before sunrise. Rules are rules, and Smirnoff wouldn’t listen to a word I say, so it wasn’t worth it. I had to sit through whatever shit he had to say. It mostly entered one ear and went out the other but some tidbits were interesting to hear from his slurred speech.\n\nFor example, he said he served in the army before the old country decided that Communism isn’t actually a good way to organize a state. When he was in the army the military had this special unit that hunted some sort of entities around the whole region, capturing them, experimenting on them and just doing all sorts of shady clandestine shit.\n\nIt was interesting to listen to that, chiefly because he finally mentioned something he hadn’t already told me for the 160^(th) time. So, I listened.\n\nSee, one day, he did not show up, interestingly just the day after he told me about his army adventures. I didn’t think much of it, could’ve gotten drunk and fallen asleep elsewhere. But then he wasn’t there the next evening, or the evening after that. At that point I thought he was dead. But then during the start of my shift, right after my day shift colleague left, a black car with tinted windows rolled up and two men in suits exited.\n\nIt was something right out of the Matrix. They approached me and started asking me about some guy whose name I didn’t recognize, but I assumed was Smirnoff. They asked me if he told me anything, I told them that the old fart had schizophrenia or his brain was just too destroyed by alcohol to talk about anything coherently.\n\nThey seemed satisfied and left me alone… I did notice they had a scent of stale milk… With hint of lavender?\n\nAnyway, I never saw Smirnoff again… But ever since then the little people have been more active around the vodka. I wonder if it has anything to do with Smirnoff’s disappearance? Maybe his soul is trying to open one last bottle before he goes into the afterlife? Who knows.\n\nAll I know is that those tiny little bastards knocked another bottle off the shelf and then ran off to whatever hole they entered through, those bottles go off my damn paycheck – *little shits*…\n\nAgh, I should talk about *them.*\n\n The Bloodsuckers.\n\nNow you might be imagining some Nosferatu type monstrosities ready to suck you dry, but no, they are not.\n\nThey look like you and I. And I swear I’ve seen some of them walk in the sun without issue, somewhere… They always look, *familiar.* They’re the ones who buy the Wintston’s teeth-moonshine bottles. Now, I don’t know exactly what’s inside of them, but I can only assume it’s blood, looking at the vampiric looking bastards coming over, but it could be some kind of wonder drug for all I know…\n\nThere’s no money exchanged though, only *teeth*. Plus, they all look very old yet very young at the same time. They send shivers up my spine each time they gently knock three times on the small window of my kiosk. I just know its one of *them.*\n\nThis woman… Or whatever *it* is comes over at rare occasions and usually orders number six. What the numbers represent I have no idea, but she likes her sixes. Out of all the others who are usually more reserved and like to stare into my soul and drain the air from my lungs by their mere presence.\n\nAll the others look unique but similar to each other, sometimes I mix them up. But miss Six, she’s one to remember. At first I thought she was a normal customer – there are still normal customers, but rarely.\n\nWhen she knocked and I opened that tiny little door slash window, I was greeted by a red haired and green eyes woman whose face and smile were something right out of a work of art.\n\nI kept my monotone professionalism though, but her warm demeanor made my night that much bearable. But then – *“Darling, number six please!”* she said it with a wink while extending her pale hand that held a small pouch – 18 teeth… I am no dentist but I am fairly certain they looked human…\n\nThe rest of her *brethren*; if you could even call them that is monotone or just don’t seem to give a shit about me. Some of them seem outright hostile but try to hide it…\n\nAt least missus Six is nice, I really appreciate her chatting me up here and there, even though my responses are limited to a few nods and short replies. I do try and give her a soft smile once I grab the pouch of teeth and give her the mysterious liquid in the bottle… But yes, I do not mind the others just getting it over with, if anything, I prefer that.\n\nNow, Winston told me only later on that I should not leave the kiosk under any circumstances because of the Bloodsuckers – he calls them “Those thieving pricks” for your information, so he is not gleefully accepting teeth as payment… *At least I know my boss doesn’t collect human teeth.*\n\nAnyway he says they tend to be aggressive like the *roosters*. He never told me what they’ll do to me if they catch me outside… I mean, others just go around fine; the locals? Agh, I never did understand it.\n\nWell, onto the next one I guess… A more recent development with the *roosters.* The thing with the roosters is that they are not visible. You can’t see them, but they sure as hell can see you. But like any other person or thing that comes to this kiosk, they seem to respect its boundaries, for some reason.\n\n The roosters – as Winston told me, like to rip people apart. But they choose their prey carefully and leave no traces behind. Why do I call them roosters? Well they become more and more active as the night progresses and just before sunrise tend to bang and scrach on the kiosk roof and walls like they are desperately trying to get inside.\n\nThey’d wake up anyone from the deepest of slumbers. Sometimes they do shake up the kiosk a bit to knock some things down, but nothing too much. It ain’t broken bottles but its just fallen candy bars and such.\n\nI am not restocking it anyway…  The boss does it. But I am paid enough to pick them back up and place them where they were at. I am not that lazy.\n\nNow… Oh, yeah… Those fuckers who destroy the bottles. See, this is more of a recent development. A couple months ago a dump truck broke down in the middle of the street sometime early in the morning, I’d guess somewhere around 3:30.\n\nThat truck stood there for hours, hell even Winston said it was there for a long ass time after I left my shift. It was coming from the direction of the dump. So it was empty and didn’t make the smell any worse than it already is. But it sure as hell was unusual.\n\nI mean they had a problem with the engine or something and they just got out and left it there… Running, wasting fuel. I’m pretty sure they got fired after that.\n\nAfter that night, the bottles started dropping and I heard all sorts of tapping and whispering among the shelves. The little people came from the dump riding on that truck… I am sure of it. And they were the ones who sabotaged the engine, the sly bastards…\n\nWinston thought I was full of shit at the start but soon enough he told me he saw them himself. And he told me not to follow any of the bastards. I nodded, but honestly even he couldn’t stop me in my righetous crusade to cull those little bastards and shoo them off my – I mean, Winston’s property.\n\nAnd exactly two weeks after they first appeared, I managed to get a glimpse of one who got down to the ground. We just got a new shelf for the center of the kiosk itself, which split the kiosk into basically two rooms that went into a circle. Now the little shit rounded the corner and so did I… But I didn’t see my desk and lamp.\n\nI saw a hallway, a hallway made of shelves with all sorts of things, it had aisles upon aisles of shelves. It looked like a damn library of kiosk shelves… Something right out of a goddamn fever dream. Including a lot of vodka, of course. I imagine Smirnoff would see this place as his own personal heaven.\n\nI really thought if I was hallucinating but after blinking and slapping myself I was fairly certain that there was indeed a whole long ass hallway inside the kiosk which was… It was simply impossible.\n\nMy sleep deprived dumbass thought it be a good idea to venture forth into the hallway and see where that little dude went. But I was luckily stopped from doing something stupid by a knock at the small window. A customer.\n\nIt was Miss Six – I remember her soft smile as she handed me the teeth pouch. I automatically went to the desk to retrieve her bottles… I stopped halfway, realizing that the *halls of vodka* tear in reality… Wasn’t there?\n\n“Dear, is everything alright?” I remember Miss Six ask as I froze in place. I shook myself out of it and got her bottles.\n\nAfter I got rid of her I returned to the desk and confirmed that I probably hallucinated the entire thing. It was just my desk… And the rest of the boring room.\n\nThen I decided to walk back to the front, but the other way ‘round the central shelf. I turned my head around, I don’t know why. But there it was.\n\nThe fucking hallway materialized again. I went to the other side again – No hallway. Then walked to the other side, the hallway was there again.\n\n I wrote a note as reminder to inform Winston of the, I quote –\n\n *“Transdimensional tear in reality, maybe caused by the vodka stealing-gnomes caused. Possibly safe. Probably not.”*\n\nOnce my colleague arrived to relieve of my shift… His reaction was indifferent. I just told him not to go inside. *I doubt he moves at all during the shift.* He’s a weird dude… Never did talk to him… I don’t even know his name.\n\n***Note to self : Learn the chronic insomniac’s name.***\n\nAnyway, Winston’s reaction to finding his Kiosk has a portal to a pocket dimension was not of shock, but of pragmatism. I mean, it seemed like there was an infinite amount of stock inside there. He went inside without a second’s thought and grabbed a few things… Financially, this was a win.\n\nHe told me it was safe to go inside – But to be cautious, of course. Grab some things to fill the shelves… He also added another thin wall to block the fact that people can see if I walk behind the shelf and not emerge on the other side, that would be freaky.\n\nI doubt any of them would be surprised… Or care. But okay.\n\nYou know after working here for this long, yeah you get used to some things. But the constant scratching and the constant threat of whatever is out there… I don’t have the nuts to go out at night myself anymore.\n\nI get to work, I stay inside. I try to do my thing. I never sleep, ever. I mean I do sleep a little when I get home. But at the job? No, I can’t. My brain just refuses to shut down.\n\nI swear its like this place is keeping me awake.\n\nIt sometimes feels alive, like the walls are pulsing. You know the radio that plays inside sometimes has interference… It’s an old piece of junk. But I swear I can hear voices on the other end calling my name…Beckoning me to open *the door.*  I could just be hallucinating from the sleep deprivation. Which is the more likely probability. Or I could just simply be going insane… Or this place is just cursed.\n\nI feel like this job is slowly draining me something, not just energy… Each shift I feel like I lose a bit of myself to something. Each shift becomes somehow longer and more unhinged in some ways. But I came to a point where it just becomes the new normal.\n\nEven if I told anyone no one would believe me. So I am writing this here as some sort of diary. I’ll probably write more… This was cathartic in many ways, to just write this down. I’ll do my best to catalogue my experiences.\n\nI still have stories to tell, but not much time to write. And honestly I don’t know for how much longer I’ll work here… Either I’ll quit – or this place will consume me before that.\n\n The money’s good, at least.\n\n…\n\nYou know, Miss Six did tell me yesterday I looked like I needed a hug…\n\n I might take her up on that offer.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n "},"21":{"title":"I'm An Evil Doll But I'm Not The Problem: Part 24","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kb5j99\/im_an_evil_doll_but_im_not_the_problem_part_24\/","flair":"Series","author":"HughEhhoule","selftext":"Last week was a real change of pace\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/s\/6o9FIzqLF4\r\n\r\n\r\n It’s been a long time since I’ve been behind a keyboard so excuse me if I’m a little rusty. Of course, then I was at least talking about things that were grounded in science and logic. \r\n\r\nIt’s Mike, and to sum up what was a very complicated decision, I stole Punch’s phone and took off on everyone in the middle of the night. \r\n\r\nI know, fuck me.\r\n\r\nYou guys are rooting for that little fella and you have every right to. But sometimes, you just have to do what you have to do. \r\n\r\nWhy take the phone? To be honest, I’ve wanted to try and reach out to the world since I got tangled up in this. But this is the first time in a long while that my thoughts have been anything approaching coherent.\r\n\r\nWhy did I leave everyone? \r\n\r\nI need to find out what Demi is up to. I know who he is, I know how he thinks. Everything is at scale, his plans are never small. \r\n\r\nHe’s my problem, and I can’t have him biting us in the ass. \r\n\r\nSo now is the time to face what’s waiting for me. If I die, at least I keep it away from everyone else. \r\n\r\n Following him is easy, our similarities are what let him worm his way into my brain without me realizing it after all. Catching up on the other hand, that’s the difficult part. \r\n\r\nAfter a couple of days of dodging creatures I’d rather forget and eating stolen MREs (what I know about hunting and foraging fits in a thimble with room to spare.) I see my first body. \r\n\r\nHuman, not one of the lost. Saying he’s been killed would win me understatement of the year. He’s been disassembled, at first I think his bits and pieces have been scattered at random, but as I survey the scene, I see it. \r\n\r\nIt's an arrow. With one word underneath it, “Waiting.”.\r\n\r\nHe’s getting off on this. The bastard loves death. \r\n\r\nBelieve it or not, I never have. I’m not some lunatic destined to kill. I stumbled into a violent life and ever since it’s been taking little pieces of my sanity. \r\n\r\nNot here though. Over a decade of mental and physical trauma just, gone. A fresh start in a rotten world. \r\n\r\nWith my burst blood vessel and flensed arm, I’m fucking that up already. \r\n\r\nI decide to change up my look a bit. Demi is going to be where people are, and I don’t know how much blending in I can do looking like a clown. \r\n\r\nI manage to do a little bit of wartime tailoring and hope it’s enough. I’d be more worried, but “Stuck in a paranormal dessert.” Isn’t a hard fashion statement to mimic. \r\n\r\nThe walk is lonely on more levels than should be possible. I’ve spent the last few years hopping from one paranormal shitstorm to the next. A bit player in the struggles of a half dozen different groups. Losing pieces of myself and watching people die. \r\n\r\nBut Punch and the guys, I don’t know. As fucked up as I am, it’s the first time I feel like I’ve fit in. I miss them. \r\n\r\nThen there’s the sudden near-silence in my skull. I’ve been hearing voices since I first watched the light fade out of someone’s eyes. Now, silence. \r\n\r\nI know a lot of what I am is the result of my brain not wanting to deal with the horrific crap I’ve seen, and done. But not them. Those 2 are, something else. Over time, I’ve grown to rely on them. \r\n\r\nThen again, isn’t that the type of backwards rationalization mentally unwell people make all the time? \r\n\r\nEither way, I find myself alone in my own mind as I find the next bodies. \r\n\r\nIt was a struggle this time, on the open plains. A couple missing pieces from people who aren’t the deceased, deep pits in the gravel, this was an attack not a murder.  He’s either getting sloppy, or brazen. \r\n\r\nOne thing I don’t notice are signs of, I don’t know the technical term, but, magic. No scorch marks, or anything else unnatural. Seems strange to me. From everything I know and have seen from Demi, that kind of stuff is his bread and butter. \r\n\r\nI pass the hours wondering if everyone else is all right. I know I don’t exactly pull my weight, but I hate the idea of leaving them alone. \r\n\r\nHave you guys ever wondered about clown college? \r\n\r\nA lot is what you’d think, the basics, learning routines, acrobatics, makeup. But really, that’s all stuff that any birthday party pretender can learn with a week and a Youtube account nowadays. \r\n\r\nThe things you might be surprised by are the psychology, anthropology and first-aid courses. It’s the blending of all of this that gets you the right to have your face on an egg. \r\n\r\nDespite how it may seem, it’s really easy to fuck up being a clown. Now, that’s fine if you’re the cool uncle dressing up for a Bar-Mitzvah, but if you want to make things into a career, you need to understand people. \r\n\r\nNot only that but you need to be able to do it at a glance. Which kid is going to piss themselves when you walk over? Which bored dad is going to give you a tip, and which one is going to throw a drink in your face after a gag? My favorite professor had a great way of putting it, “Showmanship is fast-food psychology.”.\r\n\r\nSo I watch the groups of wanderers around me, looking for which ones may have been hit by Demi. Or which may make the most inviting target for his next violent urge. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Easy, I come in peace.” I say with a friendly smile. Holding up my hands and turning in a circle. \r\n\r\n“What’s in the bottle?” the young man, in his 20’s but with eyes that have seen a lifetime’s worth of horror, replies. He levels an old, worn rifle at me. \r\n\r\n“Seltzer, tastes like hell, but it’s safe to drink.” I explain. \r\n\r\nThe group of ten people are guarded, but inviting none the less. Wounds over most of them, they’re all so young. The rifle wielding man, Nathan is the oldest of the bunch. \r\n\r\n“Sorry about the gun, got attacked a while back, thought you might have been the same guy.” Nathan explains, offering me what he vainly calls stew. \r\n\r\n“Was he taller than me? British accent?” I ask. \r\n\r\nNathan looks suspicious, I hear another member of the group readying something. \r\n\r\n“Friend of yours?” The worn man says. \r\n\r\n“Not in the slightest. I’m looking to find him though.” I say, darkly. \r\n\r\n“You’re going to need more than a bottle of water. The guy is a monster. Killed two of ours. Had to shoot him three times to get him to notice, even then, didn’t find a body.” Nathan explains. \r\n\r\n“Any idea which way he went?” I ask. \r\n\r\n“East, for all that’s worth around here.” Nathan answers. \r\n\r\n“Much appreciated. The food as well. \r\n\r\nHow did you guys end up here?” I inquire. \r\n\r\n“My college is partnered with a high school. Every year we do an event where we take a bunch of kids for a week and show them the college life. Let them sit in on a few classes, go to some events, get a taste of what they have to look forward to.\r\n\r\nDay 5 we went to an amusement park, took them into a maze. Last thing I remember was touching two walls, then we were here. That was about a month or so ago.” Nathan replies. \r\n\r\nI pump the group for information in the guise of swapping war stories. I make up a name, a life, I tell them what they want to hear. I become a person they’re comfortable with, even though I’m not. \r\n\r\n Demi hit them like a tiger. Breaking apart two members of their group in front of them. \r\n\r\nNathan says it seemed like he was asking the victims questions, but they didn’t make sense. \r\n\r\nSomething feels off. Why leave the rest? If it was supposed to be a message, why not have them relay it? \r\n\r\nBut that’s the problem dealing with someone like Demi. I’m trying to outwit a brain with a couple extra centuries of processing power in it. \r\n\r\nNone the less, come morning, I’m following the lead, and heading east. \r\n\r\nAs I watch a Grasping in the distance, I find myself laughing. There was a point in my life where I couldn’t wrap my brain around being involved in a couple of minor conspiracies. Now I’m watching a giant set of clawed hands pluck people from the desert like popcorn. \r\n\r\nI heat my second to last MRE in an island of brittle needle-leaved trees. Things with large reflective eyes stare at me from high branches. I haven’t caught a glimpse of one yet, but as long as they don’t get any closer, they can keep being spooky all they want. \r\n\r\nMovement in the trees in front of me. I get low, slinking to the edge of the firelight. \r\n\r\nI clutch what’s left of my walking stick. One end jagged, my heart races. \r\n\r\nWhat comes out of the disintegrating needles of the forest floor, doesn’t really strike fear in my heart. \r\n\r\nMakes sense, I guess not everything “That never was” is going to be that way because it’s horrifying. \r\n\r\n4 Large black eyes, six stubby, arachnid-like legs covered in long, black and white fur. It stumbles, and I notice it’s bleeding. \r\n\r\n I know, you’ve all read stories of angler-fish like things. And the internet tough guys are going to be ranting about how stupid it was to go up to the thing. But the human brain is set up in a certain way, we have empathy for a selection of features. Call me a caveman, but I didn’t like seeing the little thing in pain. \r\n\r\nNo real teeth or claws I can see, I kneel down, expecting to see some kind of bite or lodged object. But as a guy who knows his wounds, the two inch gash on this creature looks…\r\n\r\n“Purposeful.” I say feeling a long, cold knife press itself against my throat.\r\n\r\n“Don’t worry Michael, she’ll be fine. You on the other hand, I’m not so sure.” Demi growls into my ear. \r\n\r\n The wide bodied, needle pointed dagger is sharp enough to be drawing blood already. I can smell the reek of Demi’s breath. \r\n\r\nMy heart pounds, I start to pour sweat. As I see the massive, scarred hand holding the knife, I’m at a loss as to what I could do to stop him. \r\n\r\n“What do you want?” I say, calmly, trying not to upset the ancient killer. \r\n\r\n“I don’t think we have that long Michael. I’m a man of grand aspirations.\r\n\r\nBut what I need from you is my pound of flesh.” Demi says, angling the blade so it’s tip rests under my jaw. The pain as the immaculate point hits bone is stunning. \r\n\r\nI stay silent. I’m overwhelmed, outmatched, and unarmed. It’s all I can do to not piss myself. \r\n\r\nWe stand in silence, I fail to remain stoic. Tears start to fall as I think of the fact this is where everything ends. \r\n\r\nI feel the knife move, Demi growls, I wait to feel the blood pour down my chest. Hoping a slit throat is as far as he takes it.\r\n\r\nWith a silver blur Demi strikes me in the forehead with the flat of the blade. The pain is unbearable, I hit the ground clutching my skull. \r\n\r\nI hear Demi walk to the other side of the fire, mumbling something I can’t quite make out. \r\n\r\nRed spots in my vision, “ Fuck!” I scream trying to focus beyond the nagging pain. \r\n\r\n“There was a time when you would have heard me coming a hundred meters off, and would have bitten off my thumb instead of submitting to me.” The Ripper says in a disappointed tone.\r\n\r\n“That’s paranoia and delusions for you.” I spit. \r\n\r\nI’m going to have one hell of a bruise, but all things considered, my head is fine. \r\n\r\n“Is it really paranoia when they’re out to get you?” Demi asks with a smirk. \r\n\r\n“What are you getting at?” I reply, annoyed. \r\n\r\n“I’d think it’s obvious. \r\n\r\nYour friends don’t need a well adjusted Children’s performer. They need someone who can do the wrong thing for the right reason.” Demi says.\r\n\r\n“He’s called Leo, and he does it ten times more effectively than I do.” I explain. \r\n\r\n“Leo is the issue. \r\n\r\nI’m not blessed with foresight. In fact, here, I’m blessed with nothing. \r\n\r\nBut I’ve always been a little faster, stronger, smarter, and keener, than most. That, is my essence.\r\n\r\nThis place is making him see things in very black and white terms. He cannot abide the creature below the sand.” Demi says. \r\n\r\n“And? Him, Sveta, and Punch? I wouldn’t want to be Mr. Sandy.” I reply dismissively. \r\n\r\n“Take it from someone who has been watching. \r\n\r\nThat lot has been bludgeoning their way to unlikely victory. The thing below is not going to be overpowered, tricked, or scared into submission.” Demi says. \r\n\r\n“So, what’s the scam Demi? Can we bypass all of the manipulation? I’m saying yes or dying, I get that.” I ask.\r\n\r\n“The thing below, it’s getting tired of the millennia of eating scraps. It’s begun to overstep it’s bounds.\r\n\r\nIt speaks to people, convinces them to lead their fellows into it’s eager maw. \r\n\r\nIt’s only a matter of time before Leo figures this out and leads you all into a half-planned march to death. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I say we mind our own affairs and make it to the city post-haste. But none of them are going to listen to me. Nor would they be willing to do what needs to be done if they did.” Demi explains. \r\n\r\n“You’ve got a plan and it’s going to involve casualties is what you’re saying, right?\r\n\r\nI can’t, I’m not going to do that to myself, again.” I reply. \r\n\r\nDemi stares at me, minutes of silence, nothing to do but notice the barely restrained rage in his heavy features. \r\n\r\n“This isn’t real, you fucking twit. \r\n\r\nThere isn’t enough of me left to rattle a chain or fog a window. Your mind has been torn apart in ways that will never heal. \r\n\r\nIf you don’t accept that, you will wind up destroyed entirely. Or worse, you’ll embrace this place, and become a resident of the city. \r\n\r\nI know you’re thinking of it. But understand, for all the blood I’ve spilled, for all the lives I’ve ended. That was a bridge too far for me at my worst.”   Demi growls. \r\n\r\nThe realization hits me. I’m sure I’d have caught on quicker if I sprouted a screaming second head, or my mind somehow got worse. But that’s how insidious this place is. \r\n\r\n“You could be lying.” I say, weakly. \r\n\r\n“No, I simply want this to be over. I want us back trying to figure out how we can go our separate ways. \r\n\r\nI’m sick of being used as some kind of McGuffin when you find yourself in over your head.” Demi replies. \r\n\r\n“I’ll keep you trapped there as long as I can. Whatever you do, however you help, you’re Jack the Ripper.” I state. \r\n\r\n“Bully for you. \r\n\r\nNow that we’ve both stated our opinions, and future plans, are we in agreement on a course of action in the present?” Demi asks. \r\n\r\nI don’t give him the satisfaction of an answer. The worst part of all of this isn’t that I don’t have a choice, I could walk away right now. It’s that I know he’s right. The fact I think like the monster in front of me, looming in the firelight like death itself, makes me sick. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we begin our journey, Demi catches me up on the group he’s been following. Six massive guys, wearing sports jerseys of some form. Even from a distance I can tell they’ve been here a while, they way they’re built that doesn’t come from training. \r\n\r\nOne of them has the thing below deep in his mind. He’s intent on collecting others, and delivering them to it’s waiting grasp. \r\n\r\n“So, we figure out which one, you kill him, we’re done. I don’t see where the moral ambiguity comes in.” I say as we watch them from afar. \r\n\r\n“I don’t care about saving some morons who couldn’t avoid a pit to hell. \r\n\r\nThis peon, has a connection to the one below. We’re going to need to get information from him, in ways that will make people likely to want to stop us. \r\n\r\nBeyond that we have to actually figure out who he is, which we can’t do without mingling with the meat.” Demi explains. \r\n\r\n“It’s shit like calling people ‘meat’ that makes trusting you impossible. I just thought I’d point that out.” I reply. \r\n\r\nBy the time we catch up to the group they’ve joined with another half dozen or so people. Demi does sweet fuck all to try and appear as anything other than what he is, while I put on my friendliest face and lie about who we are and what we’re doing here. \r\n\r\nA man standing as tall as Demi walks over. Clapping him on the shoulder. From this close, the sports team members are freakishly large. Borderline inhuman. \r\n\r\n“Bro, sick hat. Looks like you shoot hoops? Am I right? \r\n\r\nName’s Moussa, means Moses in Arabic.” The man says with level of enthusiasm that borders on stimulant driven. \r\n\r\n“Good thing we’ve came across you in a desert then.” Demi says dryly.   \r\n\r\nMoussa laughs, a barking obnoxious sound. \r\n\r\n“This Guy? He’s a G!”  Moussa replies with another slap on the back. \r\n\r\nWe find out that they were part of a rugby team, The Seattle Sturgeons. Their bus went through a tunnel, and before it came out the other end, they found themselves here. \r\n\r\nI pick out a couple of interesting individuals in the second group. \r\n\r\nWe’ve got a survivalist type, with enough gear he wouldn’t  miss a couple of pieces. \r\n\r\nAnd a scrawny meth-goblin looking guy with a drug-aged face, and a backpack he is guarding like his life depends on it. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, as night falls, I find the dynamics of the groups themselves more interesting. \r\n\r\nA camp is set in an area of metallic looking overgrowth. A fire, too large to be sensible is made, and friendships begin to quickly form. Food is shared, and from somewhere bottles of liquor, cigarettes and other good-time fuel is passed around. \r\n\r\nI see it and it chills me to the core. The thing below the sand set this all up, picked out these two groups to be lead to their demise. Everything goes a little too well, with a lack of the suspicion that breeds during this kind of trauma. \r\n\r\n A deep longing, a demon more realistic but just as insidious hits me as I see the bottles of generic looking booze being passed around. I struggle with myself. Real or not, I want to try and enjoy this reprieve from my mental and physical issues as long as I can.\r\n\r\nAs I observe, looking for the Judas sheep, I hear a strange, repetitive noise. A pressurized sound, like a muffled spray can. I track it to the underweight addict, who also seems the source of the party’s healthy supply of inebriants. He’s taking huffs from a can of computer duster, puling the cans from his backpack along with the more common ways of dulling one’s senses. \r\n\r\n“That one.” Demi says, pointing to a member of the Rugby team. A pale skinned man of about 40 built like a Canadian beer bottle.  \r\n\r\nI don’t disagree. The guy has been mingling like he’s at a job fair. \r\n\r\n“Let me try and talk to him. Having something in your head asking you to do fucked up things is something I can relate to.” I say. \r\n\r\nDemi sighs, annoyed. \r\n\r\n“Fine.” He says simply, I can practically hear the eye roll. \r\n\r\nI’m sober as a judge but multiple decades of a drinking problem lets me put on a very convincing act. I watch the stout man, waiting for liquor to take it’s inevitable toll. \r\n\r\nI follow him outside of the camp. \r\n\r\n“I’d ask if you were breaking the seal, but around here that seems kind of sinister.” I say with a mild slur, laughing at my own joke. \r\n\r\n“Yeah, don’t want to be inviting any bad Mojo I guess. I’m Kyle.” The stout man says, relieving himself. \r\n\r\n“So, Kyle, once we’re done I want to run something by you.” I say, keeping my tone friendly, and neutral. \r\n\r\n“Flattered man, but not my thing. You probably have a shot with Eric though.” Kyle says. \r\n\r\nI chuckle as we both finish up. \r\n\r\n“Not quite what I wanted to talk about, but it does have to do with having something inside of you.” I say, calling out his deflection. \r\n\r\nI notice a shift, Kyle stands defensively, keeping his distance. Suspicion washing over his face. \r\n\r\n“Easy, I’m here to help. \r\n\r\nThat thing in your head isn’t in control. It might feel like it, but you’re still at the wheel. \r\n\r\nI just want to see what you…” I’m interrupted by Kyle drawing a wide spring-assisted knife.\r\n\r\nKyle stands in silence. I look to the knife, then back to him. \r\n\r\n“It’s been a long time since I’ve worried about a pocketknife. Let’s keep things civil.” I say coldly. \r\n\r\nKyle thinks for a moment, his grip on the blade tightening. Tension rises, my heart begins to pound. \r\n\r\nThen he does something unexpected. \r\n\r\nInstead of lunging, or grabbing me, he slashes himself across the face and arms, throwing the knife at my feet. He grins to me, face streaming blood before he screams. \r\n\r\n“Help, he just pulled a knife on me, he’s crazy!” \r\n\r\nHe sprints back to the camp, I know exactly how coming in hot behind him is going to look, but I see where this situation is going and it’s nothing but pain for everyone involved. \r\n\r\nKyle gets to his friends before I can catch up. He’s putting on a great act, and as i get to the group, they form a protective semi circle. \r\n\r\n“Guys, I didn’t lay a hand on him…” I begin before a man with short blond hair and a last name of “Milton” emblazoned on his jersey shoves me. \r\n\r\n\r\nHe doesn’t brace himself, he doesn’t step in, but none the less, I hit the ground ass first. I smack the back of my head off of the course sand, and can feel a hematoma start to form on my chest. \r\n\r\nI struggle to breathe as I get to my feet. I’m scared shitless, Milton here just hit me like a baseball bat without trying. \r\n\r\n“Stay back and get the hell out. We don’t want any trouble.” Milton says, fixing me with a steel gaze set a little too far back in his skull. \r\n\r\nI wheeze, feeling the situation start to spiral out of control. \r\n\r\nWhat’s worse is that the rugby players, they don’t want to hurt me. This place has done a number on them physically, but besides their corrupt companion, they’re all good guys. \r\n\r\nI stumble backwards, toward Demi, my overworked brain trying to come up with some way to get this situation under control. No one has to get hurt here, I know it. \r\n\r\nThe players keep their distance, but the scuffle has started to attract the attention of the rest of the group. \r\n\r\n“Demi, I need help.” I manage to say between gasping breaths. \r\n\r\nHe’s close enough to me I can hear his whisper. \r\n\r\n“I meant what I said. I’m tired of being your Deus Ex Corydon. \r\n\r\nMake your own way this time you ungrateful little louse.”\r\n\r\nThe next words he says are screamed and directed toward the group. When he wants to he does a damn fine impression of fear.\r\n\r\n“Please, he has a pistol and has been keeping me hostage. He’s dangerous!”  \r\n\r\nAnd that was the spark this powderkeg needed. \r\n\r\nAs a group the crowd advances toward me, but Moussa sprints out ahead, eager to stop my imagined crimes. \r\n\r\nHe’s drunk, low and clearly intending on a tackle. His jaw is wide open by the time he gets to me. \r\n\r\nThe impact sounds like a gunshot in the suddenly quiet night. The blow makes the tanned giant stumble, but it’s more out of confusion than pain or impact. \r\n\r\nHe’s with it enough to wrench out a bloody fistful of my hair as I stumble backwards clutching my throbbing hand. \r\n\r\nI have the delicate hands of a stage magician, honed by palming coins and repairing watches. Not the scar layered brawler’s meathooks I’ve built up over a decade. \r\n\r\nDemi casually sits on a chrome colored tree stump. Shaking his head at my attempt to keep things PG.\r\n\r\nAll I’ve succeeded in doing is trapping and wounding myself. Moussa on one side, the crowd on the other, and my right hand starting to go numb. \r\n\r\nI can hear my heart pounding in my ears. My vision starts to narrow, my body trembles. If this were an action movie it’d be the precursor to me pulling off some kind of miracle and destroying these half-human hardmen. \r\n\r\nBut it isn’t. This is me, without the years of coping mechanisms and experience  being thrown into certain death. I freeze. I don’t feel like I’m really there anymore. I struggle against my fraying mind. I try to stay in the fight, but suddenly there is a ringing in my ears, pain in my face and I’m on the ground. \r\n\r\nThe punch puts me out for a second, I come to arms pinned by 300 pounds of athlete. \r\n\r\nAnother blow, the world seems far away now. My sight is a cotton wraped haze. I taste copper. \r\n\r\nI try to raise my shoulders. \r\n\r\n“Stay down!” Moussa yells, throwing a punch hard enough to pull a muscle in my neck. \r\n\r\nI can tell though, he doesn’t want to kill me. He’s pulling these punches, brutal as they are. \r\n\r\nI get a leg under me and push. I manage to turn my body, use the shifting sand below me to my advantage. With every bit of flexibility I have, I manage to push myself, squirming out of his grip. \r\n\r\nFor about a second and a half. \r\n\r\nHe grabs my ankle in a crushing grip, yanking me backwards. My face rebounds off of the course sand large particles chipping teeth and tearing flesh, smaller ones grinding into the wounds. \r\n\r\nHe falls on me like a lead blanket, one massive arm locking below my chin. Still trying to avoid anything permanent. \r\n\r\nI panic, my mind failing to draw on instincts left half way across reality. \r\n\r\n“Just go to sleep bro, you lost it is all. Chill!” Moussa says, mouth fractions of an inch away from my ear. \r\n\r\nI sob, understanding that I’m going to die here. While that evil piece of shit watches, and probably cuts some kind of deal with the thing below us. \r\n\r\nThe chokehold is sloppy, Moussa in a terrible position. \r\n\r\nI don’t know If I’m being literal or metaphorical, but a part of my soul dies as I feel the eyeball burst under my thumb. I feel the electric zap of brain chemistry starting to fail. \r\n\r\nThe eye itself doesn’t feel much pain, but the nerve behind it, and the thin wall of bone behind that, are a whole different story. \r\n\r\nI break my own kind of seal then, knowing that I can’t take back what I did, and the only hope of not having to do worse, is to make it count. \r\n\r\nMoussa scrambles away, toward the crowd, but I keep pace, thumb twisting and scraping. The shrill screaming from him hits me worse than his fists. I feel dizzy. \r\n\r\nThe crowd is a few feet away now, I turn toward them, forcing myself through the pain and trauma, to grin. \r\n\r\nI hold the giant athlete’s head like a loaf of bread I’m about to break, my left thumb pressing down on his remaining eye. \r\n\r\nI don’t want to be the bad guy, the lunatic, the psychopath. In fact, I’m not. I shiver like a junkie as every instinct demands I stop this brutality. \r\n\r\nBut right now, it’s the only thing keeping me alive. It’s the only hope my friends have, if Demi is to be believed anyway. \r\n\r\n“Next person to take a step gets to teach this asshole how to read braille.” I say, trying to drive my malfunctioning brain to some kind of plan beyond convincing these people I’m scarier than I am. \r\n\r\nI know, I hate cliffhangers as much as the next guy, but believe me, you guys are going to need a break. \r\n\r\nAfter this, things get really fucked up. \r\n\r\nTill next time. \r\n\r\nDon’t do anything I wouldn’t do. \r\n\r\nMike. \r\n"},"22":{"title":"I know the horrors that hide in the rain, they still speak to me.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kb3mhg\/i_know_the_horrors_that_hide_in_the_rain_they\/","flair":null,"author":"BadandyTheRed","selftext":"I still can’t believe she is gone. [My sister Laura, her friends, all drowned.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/17o761o\/i_still_hear_the_footsteps_in_the_rain\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) At least that was what we were told. We attended a funeral, but not all the bodies were recovered. Laura’s was gone but three of her friends were recovered. It gave some glimmer of hope that she was not dead, just missing. After a year though, it seemed unlikely she would be found. The area had been searched. We were told that divers went into the lake to try and find the missing ones, but no one could.\n\nIt was devastating for my family. But what I could not understand is what exactly happened. All we knew when she left was that Laura was going on a trip with her friends last year for spring break. It was a place in the mountains several hours away. The lake Kashur Resort and Spa. Apparently they had gone into the lake one night during a storm. They had allegedly been drunk and somehow each one of them had drowned. The proprietor of the place was unable to be reached for comment, but authorities said that all evidence pointed to a tragic accident.\n\nNormally I would not have done anything but grieve for the loss of my sister, but then the letter arrived. It was from a man named Tim. He was the sole survivor of my sisters trip, he had an outlandish tale of impossible things that sounded like the delusional ravings of a person with survivors guilt.\n\nThe authorities' statement, predictably, clashed with his deranged ravings. They insisted it was a drunken swim party gone awry, resulting in an accidental death. But I never believed it, not about my sister. She was far too controlled to get intoxicated, and even if she had, she would never be so careless. Yet, the official investigation was stalled if not ended entirely.\n\nThe letter was genuinely disturbing, a cryptic tale from my sisters former friend,\n\n\"I can still hear their screams echoing in my mind. All of them. Adam and Gina were the first to fall, the splashing footsteps, swallowed by water, it was impossible. Yes, they drowned…but not in the lake. Laura, Becky, and I managed to reach the resort, the staff left us to fend for ourselves! Those things, the shapes, they followed us there.\n\nThey were in the rain, the lake, it was our fate, sealed and inescapable.\n\nForgive me, Becky, Laura. I tried, I really tried, but I was too late.\n\nI am sending this to any of your family member who will listen.\n\nI beg you, do not let them get away with this. They knew. They knew what would happen.\"\n\nIt was the creeping madness of that letter that made it seem like a fever dream, or a drug-induced delusion. Yet something in Tim's words, the raw terror that bled through his scrawled handwriting, made my skin crawl with a truth I couldn't explain. I put the letter away and departed.\n\nI struggled with the decision to reach out to the man to verify the details of his story. I had sent a letter hoping for a response, yet he remained silent, and I lacked his contact number. I learned he had relocated to Nevada, and the idea of traveling such a distance just to confront him felt overwhelming. His statements to the police seemed too outlandish to take seriously, yet part of me couldn’t shake the nagging curiosity about the truth behind his claims.\n\nI had to know for sure, so I made the decision.\n\nI would go to Lake Kashur and try and find my sister or at least say goodbye to her at the last place she was seen.\n\nThe trip took nearly seven hours, rain pelting my windshield most of the way. Though gloomy, the drive was not unpleasant and the area was admittedly beautiful. The further I drove, the more isolated the roads became, until I was winding through dense forest on a single-lane road that didn't appear on my GPS.\n\nMy phone disconnected and reconnected for the tenth time before losing the signal completely.\n\nJust when I began to think I'd made a terrible mistake, the trees parted, revealing Lake Kashur Resort and Spa. It looked impressive, though unpopulated. The main building, a sprawling three-story lodge with weathered cedar siding, boasted against a backdrop of fog-shrouded mountains. Several smaller cabins dotted the shoreline, their windows dark and uninviting.\n\nThe lake itself stretched vast and resplendent, its surface rippling despite the absence of wind. Though it was impressive and serene, something in the shifting waters made my skin crawl.\n\nA sign on the road indicated: \"Welcome to Lake Kashur - Where Memories Run Deep.\"\n\nSomeone had scratched something beneath it, but it looked like a thin layer of slap dash paint had been applied over it, trying to cover whatever message someone had attempted to carve into the sign.\n\nI parked in the nearly empty lot, only a resort truck and a few cars were there. Pulling my jacket tighter against the chill, I grabbed my bag and headed to the entrance as the skies darkened and thunder rumbled. Inside, the dim lobby was lit by antique fixtures casting long shadows across the polished floors, and I moved toward the reception desk.\n\nA rustling sound came from behind the reception desk before a woman appeared, her movements so suddenly I nearly jumped.\n\n\"Welcome to Lake Kashur,\" she said. \"Do you have a reservation?\"\n\n\"No, I was hoping to speak with someone about an accident that happened here last year.\"\n\nShe studied me for an uncomfortably long moment. \"I am sorry we are not able to disclose details of any incidents that happened here to the press.\"\n\n\"Well no, I am a relative. My name is Connor, I'm here because my sister stayed here last spring. Laura Hanson? She would have been in a larger group of people visiting for spring break. Could I check the guest book?\"\n\nSomething flickered across her face.\n\n\"I'll need to get the manager,\" she said abruptly, reaching for a phone beneath the counter. She turned away slightly, her voice dropping to a whisper. \"Mr. Dalton? There's a young man asking about an incident. Yes, last spring.\" She paused, listening. \"Yes, sir. Right away.\"\n\nShe hung up and fixed that empty smile on me again. \"Mr. Dalton will be right with you. Please wait just a moment.\"\n\nBefore I could respond, a tall figure emerged from a doorway I hadn't noticed before. He moved with unsettling grace for someone so gaunt, his impeccable suit hanging from his frame as if from a wire hanger.\n\n\"Gregory Dalton, proprietor of Lake Kashur Resort. I understand you have questions about your sister.\"\n\nHe gestured toward a seating area away from the desk. \"Please, let's speak somewhere more comfortable.\"\n\nI followed him to a pair of leather chairs positioned near a window overlooking the lake. The rain had intensified, drops streaking the glass like tears.\n\n\"Laura Hanson,\" he said, folding his hands in his lap. \"Such a tragedy. I remember her vividly. Bright young woman. Studious. Not like the others in her group.\"\n\nThe way he described her was uncannily accurate. I leaned forward. \"If I could be direct, what do you know about what really happened to her, Mr. Dalton? The official report says they drowned, but my sister was an excellent swimmer.\"\n\nDalton's eyes flicked toward the sound before returning to me.\n\n\"Rules exist for a reason, Mr. Hanson. Sometimes tragic ones.\" His voice lowered, almost hypnotic in its rhythm. \"Your sister and her friends were warned, as all our guests are, that swimming during rainfall is strictly prohibited at Lake Kashur. A liability issue, you understand.\"\n\n\"That doesn't make sense. Why would rain make them drown? And if there was a rule, Laura wouldn't break it like that.\"\n\n\"Peer pressure can be a powerful motivator, even for the most disciplined among us.\" He sighed, a practiced sound of rehearsed regret. \"They were young. Exuberant. Perhaps they thought our warnings were superstitious, many do.\"\n\nI felt a chill that had nothing to do with the draft in the old building. \"What exactly are you saying happened?\"\n\n\"They went swimming during a storm much like this one.\" Dalton gestured toward the window. \"The lake can be unpredictable. Currents shift. Temperatures drop suddenly. People lose track of how far out they swim and then, well…By the time our staff realized what was happening, it was too late.\"\n\nThe explanation, although hard to accept, was not entirely implausible. But still, something in his delivery felt hollow, like reciting lines from a well-rehearsed script. The pieces didn't fit. Tim's letter described something far more sinister than careless swimming.\n\nThunder echoed over the lake as Mr.Dalton glanced at the window. Rain poured down, churning the lake's surface. Before I could speak, Mr. Dalton interrupted,\n\n\"My sincerest condolences to you in this time of sorrow. Should you wish to remain with us for the night, I would be honored to have you stay. We have another group of young people here on break and you might enjoy their company. Besides, another tempest has arrived, and traveling amidst such torrential rain would be most perilous. Naturally, I shall provide full recompense for your night's stay, a mere token of solace in light of the profound loss of your dear sister.\"\n\nI hesitated, the conflicting information warring in my mind. I could investigate further if I stayed, maybe even find some evidence about what really happened to Laura. On the other hand, every instinct screamed that something was deeply wrong with this place.\n\n\"That's very generous,\" I said carefully. \"I think I will stay, just for the night, thank you.\"\n\n\"Excellent,\" Dalton replied, his thin lips stretching into what might have been a smile. \"Room 217 should accommodate you nicely. It overlooks the lake and is close to…\" He stopped himself. \"Well, it has a splendid view.\"\n\nClose to where Laura went missing. He didn't need to finish, I knew that guarded look and it made me even more suspicious of just what they were hiding here.\n\nThe receptionist arrived with a brass key marked 217. \"Dinner is at seven,\" Dalton said, rising fluidly. \"Feel free to explore, but stay indoors and avoid the lake while it rains, for safety.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" I agreed, accepting the key.\n\nDalton abruptly left, and a bellhop guided me to the second floor. The whole place had an eerie emptiness; only staff seemed to be lurking around.\n\nThe woman handed me the key and left without a word..\n\nInside, the room was tastefully furnished with slightly worn antique pieces, a queen bed, a writing desk by the window, and a newly renovated bathroom. The view, described as splendid, showed only a rain-beaten lake and a mist-obscured inlet. I wondered if that was where Laura went into the water?\n\nI considered Tim's letter again. How he mentioned \"shapes in the rain\" and \"footsteps splashing on the ground.\" At the time, I'd dismissed it as trauma-induced hallucinations, but now, staring at the churning lake, I wasn't so sure.\n\nThe rain intensified, drumming against the window with an almost deliberate rhythm. Thunder cracked overhead, and for a split second, I thought I saw something move beneath the lake's surface, a pale, elongated shape that wasn't there when I looked again.\n\nThe floor outside my room creaked. I froze and listened. Then I heard a shuffling sound, followed by what sounded like water dripping onto the carpet. Not the usual footsteps of someone passing by, but something different, heavier.\n\nI crept to the door, pressing my ear against it. The dripping sound continued, followed by a strange, wet rasp like someone struggling to breathe through fluid. My hand trembled as I reached for the doorknob.\n\nSuddenly a soft gurgling voice spoke to me, it sounded like a voice trying to speak underwater.\n\n“You…need to leave. Not…safe, they come tonight, the sacrifice is prepared. They will awaken, and all must drown who still draw breath here…”\n\nI was paralyzed with fear at the ominous warning and before I could turn the door handle and confront the mysterious voice, the sounds receded down the hallway, fading into silence. I exhaled shakily, backing away from the door. I had no idea what the hell was going on there.\n\nI sat in confusion as a flash of lightning illuminated the room one final time,then nothing. The rain drumming on the window abruptly ceased. The sudden silence was almost more unnerving than the storm had been.\n\nI approached the window cautiously. Outside, the transformation was startling. The lake had become a perfect mirror, reflecting the clearing sky with such precision it was difficult to discern where water ended and air began. Not a single ripple disturbed its glassy surface. The mist had vanished, revealing the entirety of the shoreline in crystalline detail.\n\nI had heard enough, something was very wrong here and I knew it was a mistake to have come at all. I checked my phone and saw it was 6:45 PM. Dinner would be served soon, the distraction might offer some cover for getting out of there.\n\nI slipped outside and rushed to the parking lot. To my horror I saw that all four tires of my car were now flat. Someone had deliberately slashed the tires, intending to strand me.\n\nMy mind raced and despite my first instinct, I paused. I considered it must be Mr. Dalton, had he wanted to keep me here for whatever he was planning? I was alone and unarmed though, so I would not confront now, I just needed to leave. My heart pounded as I backed away from the car, considering the mile or two walk back to the highway. Just then, I heard laughter and chatter near the main building, the other guests Dalton mentioned. Relieved, I followed the voices to a courtyard, where five people in swimsuits stood with drinks in hand.\n\nThey were heading to the lake despite the approaching darkness and recent rain. I figured they might be able to help me get out of there, so I followed them and discovered a small cove, partially hidden by rocks, just as Tim described. A weathered wooden dock stretched twenty feet into the water. Had Laura stood here before she vanished?\n\nAs I moved toward the dock I saw the sign, bold red and indicating,\n\n“Absolutely no swimming in the rain!”\n\nThey were very serious about that rule, and yet not much effort to enforce it if people just came out here and it started to rain.\n\nThe group of swimmers were making their way down the path toward the dock, their voices carrying clearly across the still night air.\n\n\"Dude, this place is amazing,\" one of the guys said, his arm slung around a girl's shoulders. \"Totally worth the price of this place.\"\n\n\"I still can't believe we have the whole resort practically to ourselves,\" another girl replied, her blonde hair catching the moonlight.\n\n\"The old guy said swimming during bad weather is not recommended,\" one of the taller guys said, mimicking Dalton's formal cadence. \"But what he doesn't know won't hurt him.\"\n\n\"I don't know, guys,\" a brunette girl hesitated, hugging herself. \"Did you see how he looked at us when Jake asked about swimming? It was creepy. For all we know they have hidden cameras or something.\"\n\n\"Come on, Melissa,\" the guy with his arm around her urged. \"The rain stopped. It's perfect out. When will we ever get another chance like this? It's gorgeous out!\"\n\nThe group stopped abruptly when they spotted me. An awkward silence fell over them.\n\n\"Hey creep what the hell?\" One of the guys called out. \"You work here or something?\"\n\nI realized they were talking to me as I was watching them from the tree line. I shook my head, stepping back toward the shore. \"No. Just a guest, like you.\"\n\nThey visibly relaxed, though the brunette, Melissa still eyed me with suspicion.\n\n\"Sweet,\" said the guy who seemed to be the leader. \"We're just gonna take a quick dip. You won't tell the staff, right?\"\n\nI hesitated. These were just college kids looking to have fun, exactly like Laura and her friends had been.\n\n\"I don't think that's a good idea,\" I said, surprising myself with the firmness in my voice. \"There was an accident here last year. People died. Listen, I think we need to leave, there’s something wrong with the people who work here, something’s off. Someone slashed my tires and I heard something about a sacrifice.\"\n\nThe group exchanged glances. After a pause, several of them burst into laughter.\n\n\"A sacrifice? Seriously? Did the old man put you up to this? What's next, a hook-handed killer who preys on couples making out?\"\n\n\"I'm serious,\" I insisted, stepping closer. \"My sister was here last year. She drowned in this lake with her friends. The only survivor sent me a letter about things in the lake that came out when it rained. Please, just listen to me.\"\n\nMy desperation must have shown through because some of their smiles faltered. Melissa bit her lip. \"Maybe we should go back. I didn't like the vibe of this place anyway.\"\n\n\"Oh come on!\" the other girl exclaimed. \"We paid good money for this weekend. I'm not letting some random dude with a sob story ruin it.\"\n\n\"Look, I'm not trying to scare you,\" I said. \"But something's not right here. The manager, the staff, they're hiding something. And my tires…\"\n\n\"Your tires probably got punctured on the crappy road getting here,\" Jake interrupted. \"Happens all the time in these backwoods places.\"\n\nThunder rumbled in the distance, a sound that made my blood run cold despite the clear sky above us.\n\n\"Weather's turning again,\" the tall guy noted, glancing at the horizon where dark clouds were gathering with unnatural speed. \"Maybe we should head in, just for a bit.\"\n\nJake shook his head stubbornly. \"One quick dip. We'll be back before the rain hits.\"\n\nBefore I could protest further, he was sprinting down the dock, the others following with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Jake dove in with a splash, followed by two others. Melissa and the tall guy hung back, watching from the edge.\n\n\"Come on, it feels amazing!\" Jake called, treading water.\n\nI took a step back as The sky darkened with impossible speed. One moment clear, the next churning with black clouds. The distant thunder wasn't distant anymore, it cracked directly overhead, making the dock vibrate beneath my feet. The first drops fell,\n\n\"Jake, seriously, let's go!\" Melissa called, backing away from the edge. But something was happening to the lake. Where it had been glass-smooth moments before, now the surface rippled oddly, not from the rain or the swimmers, but from below. Concentric circles formed around the three in the water, as if something was rising toward them.\n\n\"You guys need to get out now!\" I yelled.\n\nThey reached the shore and were panting, but all okay apparently. They looked to each other and then the lake and started laughing.\n\n“Ah man, nothing happened. Thought the Loch Ness Monster would come out to play or something with all the build up.” They continued laughing with only the girl named Melissa grimacing and looking around nervously. I watched the lake as the rain intensified and was disturbed by how the water began to roil, less like a lake more like an angry ocean.\n\nThe lake's surface began to churn violently, waves forming where there had been none before. The rain suddenly intensified, shifting from a gentle patter to a downpour in seconds.\n\nA light in the distance cut through the darkness from somewhere behind me, sweeping across the shoreline. I raised my hand to shield my eyes as the powerful beam briefly illuminated me, casting my shadow long and distorted across the lake. The light was impossibly bright, like a searchlight but stronger, scanning methodically across the water's surface. Two sharp, piercing whistles sliced through the air, mechanical, like an old steam engine announcing its arrival. The sound echoed across the lake, reverberating in my chest.\n\n\"What the hell is that?\" one of the guys shouted, pointing toward the source of the light.\n\nI turned to look, but the beam had already moved on, now sweeping across the turbulent surface of the lake. In its path, I could see something disturbing the water, not waves, but shapes moving beneath the surface, pale and elongated.\n\nThe group scrambled away from the shore, grabbing their belongings in a hurry. Through the increasing downpour, I noticed movement on the resort's main driveway, headlights cutting through the rain as several vehicles pulled away from the lodge, fleeing in haste.\n\n\"They're leaving us,\" I whispered, a cold dread settling in my stomach. \"The staff is evacuating, they know something is going to happen.\" I considered the mysterious words about a sacrifice and my heart sank.\n\nBefore anyone could process what was happening, a red pickup truck with flashing emergency lights lurched down the path toward our position, its tires spraying mud and gravel. It skidded to a halt at the edge of the cove, and the driver's door swung open.\n\nMr. Dalton emerged, no longer the composed proprietor but a man possessed. His thin hair was plastered to his skull, his expensive suit soaked through. In his hand was something that looked like an antique lantern, its blue flame impossibly bright despite the rain.\n\n\"It happens faster every year, as if your cohort becomes increasingly less intelligent,\" he sneered with a chilling chuckle. \"Simple rules for simple minds. Honestly, if we made a rule stating that you would die if you didn't swim in the rain, your contrarian nature would probably guarantee that the Drowned ones would never wake again. Yet, here we find ourselves.\" His eyes glinted with a sinister amusement as he sighed deeply, \"I fear you're all fresh out of luck.\"\n\nI couldn't process his words at first, they were too crazy, too detached from reality. But the cold calculation in his eyes told me this wasn't madness. It was something worse.\n\n\"What do you mean 'fresh out of luck'?\" the group's leader Jake demanded, stepping forward. \"What the hell is going on?\"\n\nDalton ignored the chaos, focusing on me. \"You should've stayed in your room, Mr. Hanson. The lake is off-limits during rain, as I warned. Now you'll see what happened to your sister. The cycle continues. The lake must be fed. Die well.\" With that, the truck sped off.\n\nTerrible splashing footsteps echoed on the ground by the shore, like something heavy emerging, yet nothing was visible. Everyone froze in fear. Suddenly, a scream pierced the night, cut short as a girl was dragged across the wet ground, clawing at the earth. An unseen force, rain turned solid, pulled her toward the water.\n\n\"Help me!\" she cried, terror in her voice. Two men lunged, grabbing her wrists, forming a grim tug-of-war against the invisible pull.\n\n\"Don't let go!\" she sobbed, her eyes wild with fear.\n\nBut something was wrong with the rain where it touched her skin. It wasn't running off but collecting, thickening, taking form. Pale, elongated fingers materialized from the raindrops themselves, clutching at her legs, her waist, multiplying with each passing second.\n\nSoon her scream was smothered by a rush of water forming from nothing over her head, drowning her on the edge of the water.\n\nIn the next moment the girl's body was pulled free from her attempted rescuers and she was yanked backward with impossible force. She didn't even have time to scream again before she was submerged, the lake swallowing her whole without a splash, as if she'd never existed at all.\n\n\"Jenny!\" her friends screamed in unison.\n\nThe remaining swimmers stood on the shore, their panicked screams barely audible over the hammering rain. I stood frozen, processing the horror of the situation. This was what happened to my sister. It wasn't an accident. It was a sacrifice.\n\n\"Run!\" I shouted to the others, finally breaking free of my paralysis. \"Get away from the water!\"\n\nBut it was too late. The rain itself seemed to come alive, droplets coalescing mid-air into translucent shapes. One man was pulled off his feet by invisible forces, dragged through the mud as he screamed and clawed at the earth. Clinging to a tree trunk, his grip failed as rain shaped into fingers pried him loose.\n\n\"We have to get to the lodge!\" I yelled.\n\nWe sprinted through the rain, surrounded by translucent figures with featureless faces, water streaming from their elongated limbs as they moved toward us unnaturally. The lodge loomed ahead, dark and imposing against the storm-wracked sky. The front entrance stood partially open, swinging lazily in the wind. Not a single light burned inside.\n\n\"They're gone,\" the tall guy panted as we raced up the steps. \"Everyone's gone.\"\n\nWe burst through the doors into the cavernous lobby. The reception desk was abandoned, drawers hanging open as if someone had left in a hurry. The elegant furniture that had seemed so welcoming earlier now cast grotesque shadows in the dim emergency lighting.\n\n\"We need to barricade the doors,\" I gasped, already shoving a heavy armchair toward the entrance. Melissa and the tall guy joined me, dragging a coffee table and an antique bench to block the way.\n\n\"I've got my car,\" Jake said suddenly, fumbling for his keys. \"It's right out front. If I can get to it, we can drive out of here!\" His eyes were wild with a desperate hope. \"I'll bring it around to the door. Be ready to jump in!\"\n\nBefore I could stop him, he bolted toward a side exit, keys clutched in his trembling hand.\n\n\"Wait!\" I called after him, but he was already gone, the door slamming shut behind him.\n\nMelissa and I pressed our faces to the window, watching as he sprinted through the downpour toward a blue sedan parked near the front steps. Splashing footsteps in the rain were appearing all around the building and parking lot with each passing second.\n\n\"Come on, come on,\" Melissa whispered, her breath fogging the glass.\n\nThe rain intensified and it became difficult to see anything outside. We pressed our ears to the glass and then recoiled when a disturbing scratching sound was heard on the other side of the door. It was followed by a voice out of a nightmare,\n\n\"Please... let us in,\" came a wet, gurgling voice from the other side of the door. The sound was unmistakably human yet horribly distorted, as if the speaker's lungs were filled with fluid. \"It's me... Jenny. I'm so cold... I can't breathe out here.\"\n\nMelissa stumbled backward, her hand flying to her mouth. \"That's her voice,\" she whispered. \"Oh God, that's Jenny's voice.\"\n\n\"Help me,\" the voice pleaded, higher now, desperate. \"I'm drowning... please... it hurts so much.\"\n\nWater began seeping under the door, not in the usual way rain might trickle in, but purposefully, gathering into a puddle that crept across the floor toward us.\n\n\"Don't listen,\" I hissed, pulling Melissa farther back. \"That's not Jenny. Your friend is gone.\"\n\nA second voice joined the first, this one deeper but equally waterlogged. \"Sam... please... open the door. I can't... hold on much longer.\" The voice choked and sputtered. \"The water... it's filling my lungs.\"\n\n\"Matt?\" Melissa whispered, her face ashen. She took an involuntary step forward before I grabbed her arm.\n\n\"It's not them,\" I insisted, though my voice trembled. \"It's whatever took them. The same thing that took my sister.\"\n\nThe frantic scratching grew louder against the walls and door. Tears streamed down Melisa's cheeks as she sobbed into her hands. Beside her, Sam gently comforted her with a soothing voice and embrace. Distracted by the unearthly voices pleading to be let in, we missed what was happening outside. Jake reached his car, the engine roared, and headlights pierced the darkness as he reversed.\n\nFor a moment, hope surged within me. The sedan backed up rapidly, aiming for the lodge entrance. If he could get close enough, we could make a run for it.\n\nBut something was wrong. The car was moving too fast, careening backward at a speed that suggested panic rather than control. Through the rain-streaked windshield, I could see the Jake was wrestling with the steering wheel, his face contorted in terror.\n\n\"Something's in there with him,\" I realized aloud, just as the sedan crashed through the barricade we'd erected, splintering the wooden barricade and shattering the lobby doors. Glass and splinters exploded across the marble floor as the vehicle smashed halfway into the building before grinding to a halt, its rear wheels still spinning.\n\n\"Jake!\" Melissa screamed, but her voice died in her throat as we saw what was happening inside the car.\n\nThe interior was filled with water, impossibly contained within the vehicle like an aquarium. Jake thrashed within, his mouth open in a silent scream, bubbles escaping his lips as he pounded against the windows. His eyes bulged, pleading for help we couldn't provide.\n\nAnd then I saw them, the pale, elongated figures sharing the flooded car with him, their translucent hands wrapped around his throat, his ankles, his wrists. One of them turned toward us, a faceless head composed entirely of water, and I swear I saw a smile ripple across its featureless visage.\n\nBut worse than the horror inside the car was what was happening behind it. The rain creatures were flowing in through the shattered entrance, seeping around the sedan's frame and reforming inside the lobby. They moved with terrible purpose, water flowing upward against gravity to shape humanoid figures with long, reaching arms.\n\n\"Upstairs!\" I grabbed Melissa and Sam, yanking them toward the grand staircase. \"We need to get higher!\"\n\nWe frantically clambered up the steps, the relentless splashing footsteps echoing behind us with a chilling consistency, never hastening or faltering, as inevitable and inescapable as death itself.\n\nWe reached the second floor landing, gasping for breath. The hallway stretched before us, doors lining both sides. Some stood ajar, inviting us into their deceptive safety.\n\n\"My room,\" I panted, pointing down the corridor. \"217. We can barricade ourselves in there.\"\n\nA flash of lightning illuminated the hallway through a large window at the end of the corridor. To my horror, the window was wide open, rain pouring in freely. The water wasn't behaving naturally , instead of simply splashing onto the floor, it gathered in midair, coalescing into those same terrible forms we'd seen outside.\n\n\"They're already inside,\" Melissa whispered, her voice breaking.\n\nWe looked behind us to see more water creatures ascending the stairs, their movements fluid yet somehow wrong, like stop-motion animation played at the wrong speed.\n\n\"Run!\" I shouted, pulling Melissa toward my room. Sam sprinted ahead of us, but as we passed the open window, a watery tendril shot out, wrapping around his ankle. He stumbled, crashing to the carpet.\n\n\"Help!\" he screamed, fingers clawing at the hallway runner as the tendril began dragging him back toward the window. I lunged for his outstretched hand, our fingers brushing for a split second before he was yanked away with impossible force.\n\n\"Sam!\" Melissa shrieked as he was pulled toward the open window, more tendrils materializing from the rain to envelop his body. His scream transformed into a choking gurgle as his head disappeared beneath the watery surface.\n\n\"We can't help him!\" I shouted, watching in horror as Sam's struggling form was enveloped in water that seemed to materialize from nowhere, covering him.\n\nWe made it to her room and slammed and locked the door. I ensured the windows were closed and barricaded the door. We sat in terrified silence as the horrifying sounds of the things outside pressed inwards.\n\nMelissa collapsed onto the floor, trembling and sobbing uncontrollably as the reality of what had happened to her friends sank in. I checked the bathroom for any water source, relieved to find the taps dry when I turned them. Small mercies.\n\n\"What are those things?\" she whispered, her voice barely audible over the pounding rain outside. \"This can't be happening.\"\n\nThe scratching began at our door, soft at first, then more insistent. Water seeped beneath the doorframe, forming a small puddle that began to grow despite our attempts to block it with towels.\n\nThe voices called, a horrible chorus of drowned friends. \"We found something amazing in the lake. You have to see it. Please let us in.\"\n\nMelissa pressed her hands over her ears, rocking back and forth. \"Make it stop,\" she begged. \"Please make it stop.\"\n\nWe waited, helpless in the room for what felt like hours. None of the things got in, but we could not get out. Then the sound of the rain stopped. The ghoulish voices begging us to let them in stopped as well.\n\nIt was the rain! I remembered what the letter said, they came with the rain. We had to take our chance and leave now.\n\n\"We're leaving,\" I said, my voice stronger than I felt. \"Now.\"\n\nMelissa looked up at me with red-rimmed eyes. \"But what if they're waiting? What if...\"\n\n\"If we stay here, we die,\" I cut her off, gripping her shoulders. \"The rain's stopped. Those things... they come with the rain. That's what happened to my sister.\"\n\nI moved to the window and peered outside. The storm had broken The lake gleamed under the dull shades of the coming dawn.\n\n\"We need to get to a car,\" I said. \"Any car.\"\n\n\"Jake's is still downstairs,\" Melissa whispered, pushing herself to her feet. Her face was pale but determined.\n\nWe crept to the door, listening for any sounds beyond. Nothing but silence greeted us. I turned the handle slowly, wincing at the slight creak as the door swung open. The hallway was empty. Not just of water creatures, but of any trace they'd been there at all.\n\nWe moved cautiously down the stairwell.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" Melissa whispered as we reached the first floor. \"How can everything be normal?\"\n\nThe lobby told a different story. Jake's car remained half-embedded in the shattered entrance, a grim reminder that not everything had been reset. But the vehicle was empty, no water, no Jake, just the keys still dangling from the ignition.\n\n\"Let's go,\" I said, moving toward the car.\n\nMelissa hesitated. \"Shouldn't we look for the others? Maybe they're still alive somewhere.\"\n\nI shook my head, remembering Laura, remembering Tim's letter. \"They're gone. If we stay, we'll be gone too.\"\n\nThe car's engine sputtered to life on the first try. I reversed it carefully over the broken glass and splintered wood. As we pulled away from the lodge, I glanced in the rearview mirror. The building loomed dark and silent, its windows reflecting the faint light of the rising sun like empty eyes. We drove down the winding road through the forest, both too traumatized to speak at first.\n\n\"I'm so sorry about your sister,\" Melissa finally said, her voice small in the confined space\n\nI nodded absently, my knuckles white on the steering wheel. \"I just wish I knew what really happened to her. If those things took her like they took your friends.\"\n\nThe words died in my throat as a single drop of water hit the windshield. Then another. And another.\n\n\"No,\" Melissa whispered, her eyes widening in terror. \"Not again.\"\n\nRain began to pelt the car, increasing in intensity with unnatural speed. I pressed my foot to the accelerator, the sedan lurching forward on the narrow road.\n\n\"Faster!\" Melissa urged, twisting in her seat to look behind us.\n\nI heard it then, the unmistakable sound of splashing footsteps keeping pace with the car. Not on the road, but somehow beside us, within the curtain of rain itself.\n\n\"Connor…\"\n\nMy blood froze. It was Laura's voice, clear as day, coming from just outside my window.\n\n\"Connor, why are you leaving me?\" The voice was perfectly my sister's, yet horribly distorted, as if she were speaking through water. \"I've been so alone.\"\n\n\"Don't listen,\" Melissa warned, her hands pressed against her ears. \"It's not her.\"\n\nBut I couldn't help myself. I glanced toward my window and saw a pale face formed in the rain, Laura's face, her features rippling and flowing but unmistakably hers. Water streamed from her hair, her eyes, her mouth as she clung to the car, impossible yet undeniable.\n\n\"Please, Connor…I'm drowning…help me.\" Her watery fingers pressed against the glass, leaving no marks yet somehow I could feel the chill of her touch through the window.\n\nI swerved, nearly sending us off the road. The tires skidded on the wet asphalt as I struggled to keep control.\n\n\"Don't look at it!\" Melissa screamed, but her eyes were fixed on her own window where Matt's face had formed in the rain, his features twisted in agony.\n\nThe windshield wipers worked frantically, slicing through the apparitions only for them to reform instantly. Laura's voice grew more desperate, more insistent.\n\n\"You promised you'd always protect me…why did you leave me here? I'm so cold…so dark under the water.\"\n\nMy chest constricted with grief and guilt. \"I'm sorry,\" I whispered, tears blurring my vision. \"I'm so sorry, Laura.\"\n\n\"Pull over,\" her voice coaxed, sweet and terrible. \"Just stop the car. Let me in. We can be together again.\"\n\nFor a heartbeat, my foot hovered over the brake pedal. The longing to see my sister again, to speak with her one last time, was overwhelming.\n\n\"Connor, don't!\" Melissa's hand clamped down on my arm. \"It's not her! Remember what happened to the others!\"\n\nThe spell broke. I stomped on the accelerator and eventually the voices receded as well as the rain.\n\nMy sister was gone, what was left there was not her. Melissa and I made our way back to what we believed was safety, but I recalled Tim and his survival and realized we would never really be safe again. Those creatures had marked us, and they would relentlessly pursue us. The rain, once a simple part of nature, had transformed into a constant harbinger of our impending doom.\n\nThat was all two months ago. Melissa and I stayed in touch after our escape from Lake Kashur, bound by a trauma no one else could understand. The official report blamed a flash flood that claimed her friends, another tragic accident like Laura’s.\n\nI tried to explain what really happened, rain forming into people, drowned voices, and a proprietor who fled, leaving his guests as sacrifices, but it sounded insane. They offered grief counseling and quietly closed the case.\n\nI’ve spent hours researching Lake Kashur. Ownership records reveal a history of “tragic accidents,” yet Gregory Dalton’s name is missing, as if he never existed. The most disturbing find was a 1937 newspaper clipping showing Dalton at the resort’s opening ceremony, unchanged by time, looking exactly like he did when I saw him in person.\n\nI had no idea who or what he really is and I don’t know if I will ever know.\n\nTonight, it is raining again. Even with the blinds drawn, I hear the voices, splashing footsteps, and fingernails scratching at the glass. Melissa calls these episodes “hauntings”, fitting since the dead spirits will never give us peace.\n\nNow, as the relentless rain pounds on every sealed entry, my phone buzzes. Melissa whispers, “They’re outside my building, I can hear them calling, Matt, Jenny, everyone.” I tell her to stay put and follow our safety plan. Even so, the hauntings grow more relentless, and I fear I may not last much longer. I fear I will never be free, from this drowning cycle of death."},"23":{"title":"Does anyone remember www.deadlinks.com?

The weird thing about this site was that you couldn’t access it directly.  Typing the URL into a browser wouldn’t lead you anywhere—no error message, no loading screen, just nothing. The only way in was through a dead link.\n\nSome broken hyperlink buried in an old forum, a forgotten webpage, or an expired ad that shouldn’t have worked. Click the wrong thing at the wrong time, and suddenly, you’d find yourself there. The site itself was empty. Just a black background, with a blank text box, and a single question written beneath it:\n\n“*What is your name?*”\n\nWhen I was in middle school, kids speculated about what happened if you put your name in. Some said you’d be cursed and die in seven days. Others swore it was some kind of alien signal, or a government experiment watching you through the screen. All the “theories” were just bits and pieces stolen from horror movies. Other kids bragged about not being scared, claiming they’d do it. But the next day, they always had excuses. \"My WiFi went out\" or \"my computer froze.\" Every time, something stopped them.\n\nI don’t remember if anyone actually put their name in. But if they did, I never heard about it. Like many urban legends, the site faded into obscurity, slowly leaving people’s memories. A relic of an older internet—forgotten, lost, left to collect malware.\n\n*discord ping*\n\nSleepyBoi420 (Derek): Hey, you guys remember that weird website kids would talk about back in middle school?\n\nOopsAllParanoia (Me): That was like 10 years ago bro.\n\n404HumorNotFound (Ryan): yeah there were hundreds of websites talked about back then \n\nSleepyBoi420: DEADLINKS GUYS!! Remember the one you had to be redirected to!\n\nOopsAllParanoia: Ohhhh yeah, the one that asked your name right?\n\n404HumorNotFound: what about it Derek?\n\nSleepyBoi420: I got to the site!\n\n404HumorNotFound: oh no\n\nOopsAllParanoia: Ok… and?\n\nSleepyBoi420: This is the url I used, [autoinsurancepolicies.com](http:\/\/autoinsurancepolicies.com), you guys pull up the site too\n\n404HumorNotFound: are you drunk?\n\nSleepyBoi420: What’s up Ryan? You scared?

How many Ryans are out there?\n\n404HumorNotFound: i guess…\n\nSleepyBoi420: Let’s goooooo! \n\nSleepyBoi420: Ok, let’s all hop on a call and do it at the same time\n\n\"Okay! You guys ready?!\" Derek said with enough excitement for all of us. \"I'm good to go,\" I said. \"Let's just get this over with,\" Ryan mumbled. \"On the count of three, we press enter,\" Derek instructed. Ryan let out a heavy, reluctant sigh but agreed.\n\n\"Three.\"\n\nI sat at my computer, staring at the screen. Rereading \"*What is your name?*\" over and over.\n\n\"Two.\"\n\nI quickly typed Mark into the text box.\n\n\"One.\"\n\nI hit enter.\n\nThe box vanished. \n\nThe words \"*Thank you, Damon.*\" took its place.\n\nI sat there puzzled—\n\nHow did it know my real name?\n\n\"Yo, all I got was this stupid ‘*Thank you, Ryan*’ message. Was something supposed to happen, Derek?\" Ryan asked, annoyed. \"Ye-yeah, same here... ummmm, I don’t know...\" Derek's voice wavered slightly. “You guys I need to let you know some—”\n\n\"Welp! I'm just gonna go watch some YouTube and go to bed. See ya!\" Derek cut me off abruptly. \n\nA second later, he left the call.\n\n“What were you saying Damon?” Ryan asked. “It… it’s nothing…” I decided not to tell him what happened. Ryan and I sat in silence for a moment. Neither of us wanted to admit that something felt off. \"Soooo… I’m gonna go to bed too,\" Ryan finally said. I agreed. We both left the call. But as I stared at my screen, those words still lingered in my head.\n\n“*Thank you, Damon.*”\n\nAt around 1:30 in the morning, I woke up to my phone exploding with messages from a frantic Derek.\n\nSleepyBoi420: Guys!\n\nSleepyBoi420: GUYS!!!\n\nSleepyBoi420: Please this is serious!\n\nSleepyBoi420: RYAN!!!\n\nSleepyBoi420: DAMON!!!\n\nSleepyBoi420: Respond!\n\nSleepyBoi420: Respond!!\n\nSleepyBoi420: RESPOND PLEASE!!!\n\nOopsAllParanoia: Why are you going crazy bro? I was sleeping.\n\n404HumorNotFound: same here, this better be good, Derek\n\nSleepyBoi420: Ok ok, so I clicked my YouTube bookmark right, and the deadlinks website popped up with this message\n\n“*A site so old, yet still alive. A single box, a single plea. Enter your name, a message waits. You close the tab, but it's too late. We know your name, Derek.*”\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't have thought twice about it, but every other website I went to had the same message\n\nOopsAllParanoia: Ok… sounds like just some dumb cryptic poem meant to scare you.\n\nSleepyBoi420: Sure, but the thing is, I didn’t even put my name in\n\n404HumorNotFound: YOU SON OF A BITCH!! This was your idea and you didn’t even put your name in?!\n\nSleepyBoi420: I’m sorry!! \n\nSleepyBoi420: But I don’t know why you’re so mad. You don’t even believe it!\n\n404HumorNotFound: I DON’T! But damn man, what if something did happen? You were just going to leave me and Damon hanging?\n\nSleepyBoi420: I’m sorry man…\n\nOopsAllParanoia: Look, why don’t we just calm down and sleep this off guys? Besides the weird message Derek got, nothing has harmed us. Let’s just call it a night.\n\n404HumorNotFound: fine… goodnight Damon\n\nOopsAllParanoia: Goodnight man\n\nSleepyBoi420: Goodnight Ryan\n\n. . .\n\nSleepyBoi420: ...\n\nOopsAllParanoia: Don’t worry about it D, I’m sure Ryan will be over it by tomorrow.\n\nSleepyBoi420: Yeah, you’re right… Goodnight Damon\n\nOopsAllParanoia: Goodnight bro.\n\nI laid down to go to sleep, but the whole experience kept circling around in my head. There’s no way this stupid website could know who we are… right? \"Whatever, I should just forget about this whole stupid night,\" I muttered, trying to reassure myself.\n\nI woke up to my phone alarm blaring at 9 AM. I had forgotten to turn it off thanks to Derek’s shenanigans last night. Groggily, I peeled myself from the bed’s warm embrace, fighting against the invisible arms that tried to pull me back under. By sheer will, I forced myself up and trudged to the bathroom. A cold shower was my first line of defense against exhaustion, jolting me awake before I gradually turned up the heat. Steam filled the room, fogging up the mirror. After stepping out, I wiped it down to brush my teeth. \n\nThat’s when I noticed something was off.\n\nEvery forward brushstroke I made was echoed in the mirror with a strange, unnatural delay. My reflection didn’t follow smoothly—it hesitated, lagging, like a fish caught on a taut line. “There’s no way a mirror can lag, right?” I muttered, staring at myself. \n\nMust be more tired than I thought.\n\nShaking it off, I decided to clear my head and put last night behind me by treating myself to my favorite coffee spot.\n\nStanding in line, I lazily scanned the menu. This place, like many others, switched to displaying the menu on a TV screen. While I was looking for what sounded good to me, the items disappeared and the screen flashed the words:\n\n\"*Thank you, Damon.*\"\n\nI blinked and looked around. No one reacted. Customers shuffled forward, heads buried in their phones or in conversations. When I looked back, the menu was normal again. Lack of sleep. Had to be.\n\nI shrugged it off, stepped up, and ordered my usual, giving my name as always. Then I waited. Five minutes. Ten. Names were called—people before and after me—yet mine never came. “Maybe they just missed me,” I thought, walking up to check. My order was there, but instead of Damon, the receipt read: David. I vaguely remembered hearing David get called a few minutes ago, but no one had claimed it. The items were exactly what I ordered, so… close enough I guess. Coffee shops screw up names all the time. \n\nGrabbing my food, I headed to the park, finding a quiet spot to enjoy my breakfast.\n\nThe scenery was gorgeous. California in December meant clear blue skies, lush green trees, and that perfect bite of cold where a hoodie was just enough. The park was unusually quiet for a Saturday. It was ten a.m., and the park was nearly empty—not that I minded. I saw that as a win. \n\nJust a handful of people loitered around. \n\nA mother sat on a bench by the playground, glued to her phone, a stroller parked beside her. For a moment, I felt the flicker of something crawl up from the back of my mind—old, heavy memories I’d spent years trying not to unpack. \n\nI thought of my own mother. The way she used to sit at the kitchen table, half-listening while scrolling through her old beat-up phone. But I shut it down before the thought could finish, like slamming a door on a room I never wanted to open. I darted my eyes around looking for anything to distract me when I noticed a little girl clambering around the jungle gym, though ‘playing’ felt like the wrong word—she moved like she was following a script only she could see. \n\nI heard the faint crunch of dried grass underfoot. Behind me, about sixty feet away, was a guy in a hoodie, pacing back and forth across the grass in unnaturally long strides. Not jogging. Not speed-walking. \n\nJust… striding. \n\nHis movements were exaggerated, walking like he didn’t know how his legs worked. It looked insane, but hey, he wasn’t bothering anyone, so I mentally filed him under ‘park weirdo’ and moved on. I sat for about half an hour, enjoying my breakfast, when something started gnawing at me. A wrongness. \n\nNobody had come or gone in the entire time I’d been sitting there. \n\nThe striding weirdo never stopped. Never changed pace. The longer I watched him, the more I realized something was off. His hoodie sagged unnaturally low on his body, the sleeves dragging through the grass like limp, empty arms. His legs were freakishly long, yet somehow, he was short. The proportions were all wrong, like someone had cranked up the leg slider in a character creator but forgot to adjust the rest. With the oversized hoodie swallowing his torso.\n\nHe didn’t even look like a person—just a head bobbing atop a pair of legs. \n\nThe little girl on the playground, every so often, she’d stop moving entirely, turning her head just to look at me. Just staring. I gave her a small wave, trying to play it off. She didn’t wave back. She didn’t even react. Just kept staring, like a little NPC waiting for me to press the right button. “Kids just do weird shit sometimes,” I told myself. But the words felt less like reassurance and more like a desperate plea to believe that this was still normal.\n\nThe mother never looked up from her phone.\n\nNot once.\n\nNot even to check on what I assumed was her kid. She sat too still—too rigid. Almost like a mannequin propped up on the bench. I glanced at the stroller beside her. No rustling. No shifting. Just stillness. Too still. I worked up the courage to approach the young mother. A prickling unease slithered up my spine. Something about this felt off. I swallowed hard and stepped closer. She didn’t react. Didn’t shift. Didn’t even acknowledge me at all. Her daughter still stood in the playground, utterly motionless. Eyes locked onto me, unblinking. “Hi…” My voice came out quieter than I intended. The mother didn’t move. “Um, I—\" I stopped. Realizing she wasn't moving. Not blinking. Not twitching. She wasn't even breathing. My eyes drifted down to her hands. That’s when I noticed. The screen on her phone wasn’t even on.\n\nThe stroller jolted.\n\nSomething shot out. I barely had time to register it before it vanished into the brush. I turned back to the mother and—\n\nShe was gone.\n\nThe bench sat empty. I turned to the playground and the creepy little girl was gone too. The stroller sat there, perfectly still, as if no one had ever been there at all.\n\nTrying to get away from the weird shit going on at that park, I decided to go to the mall. It’s the weekend. There had to be tons of people there. I drove to the mall. The roads were busy, cars passing like usual, but when I pulled into the parking lot, my stomach dropped.\n\nIt was completely empty.\n\nNot just sparse—vacant.\n\nI sat in my car, gripping the wheel, watching the road. Cars kept driving past, not a single one turning in. It was like the mall didn’t even exist to them. Then, finally, I saw a car pull in. I exhaled, relieved—until I noticed something wrong. As it pulled in, it disappeared, like it was sinking into an invisible void. The back bumper was the last thing to vanish, swallowed as if it had driven behind a mirror. I blinked and rubbed my eyes. The lot was still empty. I turned my attention to the mall entrance. Watching. Waiting. \n\nFive minutes. Nothing. Another five. No one walked in. No one walked out. Every instinct told me to leave. But I had to know. I got out of the car and walked up to the automatic doors. They slid open instantly and I was greeted with generic pop music. I stepped inside.\n\nIt was noon on a Saturday. Almost Christmas. This place should be packed. But it was completely empty. I wandered through the barren halls. Stores were open, fully stocked, yet there were no employees. No shoppers. The lights were on. Registers were running but, it looked as if everyone had just stepped away. “Am I being pranked or something?” I muttered under my breath. A thought crossed my mind—”if no one was here, what's stopping me from taking something?” \n\nI shut that thought down immediately.\n\nStill, with no one around, I felt… wrong. Like I was trespassing somewhere I shouldn’t be. It took me entirely too long to realize that the music had changed.  The cookie cutter pop music was replaced with a droning piano melody—thin, stretched, and off-key. Like an old record player dying mid-spin. While I made my way through the empty lobby of the mall I heard something that made goosebumps erupt along my arms.\n\nFootsteps.\n\nNot the light tap of sneakers. Not dress shoes clicking against tile. It was bare feet slapping the floor. A guttural growl echoed from somewhere deep down the corridor. Low. Rumbling. I darted into the nearest open store, knocking over a display case in my rush. It hit the floor with a shattering crash. \n\nShit. \n\nNo time to worry about that. I needed to hide. I had bolted into a women’s clothing store so naturally I started towards the dressing room. \"No—idiot, that's way too obvious,\" I thought, silently roasting myself. Then, my eyes landed on a pink door at the back of the store. \n\nAn employee’s section.\n\nI sprinted toward it and grabbed the handle. It turned. I threw myself inside into a long, dimly lit hallway that stretched endlessly in both directions. Behind me, I heard it—the crunch of glass. My stomach twisted.\n\nIt was inside the store. \n\nThere was no time to make a choice. Instincts took over and I darted to the right. The hallway seemed endless and it felt like I had been running for the past ten minutes, my heart pounding. \"This doesn’t make sense. The mall isn’t this big.\" I thought. Suddenly, I slid to a stop. A figure stood ahead of me. A dark silhouette with long black hair. It was standing still. Motionless. My chest seized with pure, cold terror. Behind it…\n\nThe pink door.\n\nThe same one I had used to enter the hallway. I had been running straight. But I ended up back where I started?? The figure stepped forward. I turned around but this time, I searched frantically for any door. Anything I might have missed. Between the sound of my own racing footsteps, I heard it. Slow. Heavy. Steps.\n\nIt was following me.\n\nNot chasing. Just following. Like it thought there was no escape for me. My confusion deepened when I saw that the hallway now ended in a solid wall, with only a single door. I didn’t hesitate. The door shattered open under my weight, the world spinning around me as I stumbled forward—and into darkness.\n\nThe air was cold. Crisp. I was outside. But something was wrong. I had only been inside for an hour. Two at most. But the sky above me was a deep, suffocating black. It was night. I looked back and the door was gone. I couldn't wrap my head around what was going on. I just knew I needed to get the hell out of here right now.\n\nI scanned the parking lot. My car was sitting just a few yards away. Untouched. Sitting right where I left it. I staggered toward it, exhausted, every inch of me screaming to just get inside and leave. I flew out of the parking lot. Driving well past the speed limit, replaying the bizarre events of the day over and over in my head. The lagging mirror while brushing my teeth. The striding weirdo, the silent little girl, the still woman and the empty mall. It all felt… wrong, like puzzle pieces that didn’t quite fit together. The streetlights cast long, unnatural shadows as I pulled out onto the road. It was just past eleven p.m. and the streets were just an endless stretch of asphalt swallowed by darkness. \n\nMy hands gripped the steering wheel, the hum of the engine and the occasional flicker of passing streetlights were the only things keeping me company. I glanced in the rearview mirror to check if the mall was still behind me—and for just a split second, I saw something. A shape—small, barely noticeable—the very top of a head peeking up from the backseat.\n\nI sucked in a breath, my pulse hammering against my ribs. My grip on the wheel tightened as I forced myself to keep my eyes on the road. I must have imagined it. A trick of the light, or maybe the exhaustion was starting to play with my head.\n\nBut I had seen something.\n\nI stole another glance.\n\nNothing.\n\nAnother.\n\nStill nothing.\n\nI kept flicking my gaze between the road and the mirror, waiting for movement, waiting for something to change. With each glance, my nerves wound tighter and tighter, expecting—no, dreading—a face to rise up behind me. After glancing what felt like twenty times, relief. Nothing was there. I exhaled, letting out a breath I hadn’t realized I was holding. My muscles uncoiled slightly, my heartbeat slowing to a steadier rhythm. “See? Just my imagination.” I said to reassure myself.\n\nThe empty road stretched ahead, and as I reached for the turn signal, getting ready to merge right. I glanced at my side mirror and from the corner of my eye, something wasn’t right. It took a second for my brain to process it. The faint glint of pale skin. The curvature of fingers. Long, blood red fingers. Wrapped around the headrest of my passenger seat. My breath caught, my whole body going rigid. Slowly—so painfully slowly—I turned my head just a little more. Staring back just inches from me—\n\nA face.\n\nA hollow, sunken thing. Its eyes were wide, unblinking, black pits that seemed to swallow the light. Its skin was pulled too tight over its skull, stretched thin and sickly pale, the texture like something long dead. Its mouth was too wide, too sharp, curling into something that wasn’t quite a smile. I couldn’t scream. I couldn’t move. It just stared. And then—\n\nIt grinned.\n\nI slammed the brakes so hard I almost spun out. I veered to the side of the road, heart pounding against my ribs. I threw the door open and scrambled out. I swallowed hard, gripping the edge of the car trying to catch my breath. My pulse throbbed in my ears. \n\nI looked back into my driver side window and it was gone. I peered through the backseat window—nothing. Just to be sure, I popped the trunk—empty. That thing—whatever it was, was gone. Maybe I was just on edge. Maybe my mind was playing tricks on me. I forced myself back into the driver’s seat, gripping the wheel tight. I looked back over my shoulders.\n\nNothing.\n\nI needed to get home. Now. As I pulled back onto the road, I couldn’t shake the feeling that, somewhere in the darkness behind me, something was still there. Still watching. I drove home with my doors unlocked. I pulled into my driveway, heart pounding. As soon as I put the car in park, I yanked the keys out, threw the door open, and slammed it shut behind me. My hands fumbled to lock it—hopefully trapping whatever the hell might’ve been in there inside.\n\nThe night felt heavier now, the air thick. I turned toward my house. It was completely dark. Not a single light on. I opened the door. I needed light. Now. I flicked the switch by the door.\n\nNothing.\n\n“Oh, fuck no!” I said out loud. The power company never sent out a blackout notice. This wasn’t normal. The breaker maybe? I turned on my phone’s flashlight and stepped back outside. My house was old, and for whatever reason, the breaker box was mounted on the side. As I walked past my car, I hesitated, glancing through the windshield. The backseat was empty. But that didn’t make me feel any better.\n\nI forced myself to keep moving, pushing through the wooden gate that led to the narrow alley between my house and my neighbor’s towering brick fence. The darkness stretched forever, the alley feeling twice as long as I knew it was. Every tiny noise made me paranoid—rustling leaves, twigs snapping. It’s probably just a small animal. \n\nYeah that’s it.\n\nWhen I found the breaker. My heart sank to my knees. The door to the breaker was wide open and the switch had been flipped off.\n\nSomeone did this.\n\nI slammed it back on and tore through the alley, through the gate, up the porch steps, and into my house, slamming the door shut behind me. I locked it, my breath ragged. The sound of a rapid, scratching patter flew across my kitchen floor behind me. My blood ran cold. It sounded like a dog—long nails clicking against the wood.\n\nBut I didn’t have a dog.\n\n\"…If it was a dog, wasn’t that better than the alternative?\" I thought, trying to reassure myself. Swallowing hard, I forced my legs to move. Step by step, I crept toward the kitchen, my hand trembling as I reached for the switch.\n\nThe lights flickered on.\n\nThe room was empty. No dog. No person. Nothing. But somehow… somehow, it felt worse than before. I ignored the unease clawing at my gut and made my way upstairs, flicking on every light as I went. The brightness should have been comforting. It wasn’t. The shadows felt like they were watching.\n\nI sat at my desk, flipped open my laptop, and signed in.\n\n*discord ping*\n\nSleepyBoi420: Hey Damon, have you heard from Ryan at all today?\n\nOopsAllParanoia: Nah, he hasn’t hit me up yet. I take it you guys haven’t made up then?\n\nSleepyBoi420: No… I sent him a bunch of messages apologizing, but he never replied. In fact, I don’t think he even got on today.\n\nOopsAllParanoia: Well, let’s hop in a call. Maybe he’ll pick up.\n\nSleepyBoi420: Sure…\n\nThe group call rang. \n\nRyan’s profile was grayed out as Derek and I sat in silence, waiting. He didn’t answer. I went to message him when I saw him enter the call. I exhaled. “There he is.”\n\n“Hey Ryan, where have you been, man?” Derek asked.\n\n. . .\n\nDerek hesitated. “Ry—” A sound cut him off. A deep, inhuman rasping breath. Static crackled through the speakers. \"Wh… where…\" The distortion twisted, wet and wrong. \"Ha… have…\" A thick, gurgling noise seeped through, like something too large, too heavy was shifting against the mic. \"…y… you…\" My throat tightened. “Ryan, what are you doing?”\n\n“Yeah, that’s not fucking funny, bro!” Derek barked.\n\nNo response. Just guttural, sucking gasps, like something was trying to form words but didn’t have the right mouth for it. “Okay, Ryan, you can stop now…” I muttered. The static surged—then cut out.\n\nSilence.\n\n\"Okay, Ryan, you can stop now.\" My own voice said back to us. It wasn’t an echo. It wasn’t a replay. It was off. Like something was trying on my voice like a new coat. A chill lanced through my spine. I saw Derek leave the call.  I tried to leave too but the button wouldn’t work. \"How the hell did he leave?\" I thought, my stomach knotting. My laptop screen flickered.  \n\nWithout any warning—my webcam switched on.\n\nCold panic gripped me. I didn’t think—I just slammed my laptop shut. My hands were shaking. \"Okay, okay… the screen is shut. It should go to sleep in a few seconds.\" The speakers crackled.\n\nMy own voice spilled out into the room.\n\n\"Damon… where are you… Damon… where are you… Damon… where are you…\" I yanked the charger from my laptop, flipped it over and took out the battery. The voice didn't stop. My heart pounded and as I turned to leave the room—\n\nMy phone rang.\n\nThe sound nearly made me jump out of my skin. My ringtone blasted at full volume. I fumbled for my phone. Derek. I answered immediately. “Dude, are you good? What’s going on?” My voice was frantic, breathless. Derek’s voice was quiet. Shaky. “Damon…”\n\nHe paused.\n\nThen he said, barely above a whisper—“There’s something in my closet.” My blood ran cold. “What are you talking about?” I asked frantically. “Laughing… it’s laughing in my closet…” His voice wavered, as if he were on the verge of tears.\n\nAnd then I heard it.\n\nA low, wheezy chuckle filtered through the call. The sound was unnatural—wet and ragged, like a chain-smoker exhaling through shredded lungs. Derek’s voice broke through, barely holding steady. “Damon… what do I do?” His words were small, scared. I opened my mouth to answer, forcing down the rising panic. “You need to get ou—”\n\nThe call ended abruptly.\n\nI tried calling him back—once, twice, five times. Voicemail, every time. My heart started pounding as my brain clawed through possible scenarios—maybe he dropped the phone running; maybe the thing had cornered him; maybe he was already...\n\nThat’s when I realized—\n\nThe voice from my laptop was growing louder. More distorted and warped. The speakers crackled like they were about to blow out—\n\nThe voice stopped.\n\nAfter waiting a few minutes I slowly lifted my laptop screen. I was greeted by the same phrase I’ve seen since last night…\n\n“*Thank you, Damon.*”\n\nI barely had time to breathe before—the lights went out. I reached for my lamp. Nothing. \"Oh no… please don’t be the breaker again. Not right now.\" I muttered. I stepped towards the door, fumbling in the darkness. My fingers brushed the handle. From the other side of the door I heard—\n\n\"Damon… I found you.\"\n\nIt was my voice, muffled behind the closed door. Every muscle in my body locked. The door creaked open. It stopped, just slightly ajar. Just enough for me to see a familiar face.\n\nThe face from my car. This time just a few short inches away.\n\nGrinning. A too-wide, too-sharp, toothy grin.\n\nAnd this time, it didn’t disappear.\n\n**\\[END OF PART 1\\]**\n\n[Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kbm5ls\/does_anyone_remember_wwwdeadlinkscom_part_2\/)"},"24":{"title":"I found a door deep inside a submerged cave.

I disagree.\n\nIn space, there are stars. In the caves beneath the sea, there’s nothing but stone and pressure. You don’t float down here. You crawl. You breathe slow and careful. You pray your line doesn’t snap.\n\nI’d been diving for almost an hour when I found it — a narrow slit in the rock, just wide enough for me to squeeze through. It wasn’t on any map. My gut told me to leave it alone. But curiosity has a way of swallowing common sense.\n\nI wriggled through, scraping my tank against the walls, until the tunnel widened into a chamber.\n\nAnd not just any chamber — **a perfect sphere**. The walls were unnaturally smooth, almost polished, and the water inside felt heavier somehow, colder. It didn’t feel like a natural formation. It felt... emptied.\n\nIn the center of the cavern stood a door.\n\nJust a door. Upright. No frame. No hinges. No surrounding wall.  \nIt shouldn’t have been there.\n\nI floated closer, my light sweeping over it. The wood was dark, old but intact. No rot. No seaweed. It didn’t even sway in the currents. It looked... dry.\n\nI circled it twice, checking behind it. There was nothing but more stone. Solid rock.\n\nI don’t know how long I stared. Every instinct told me to leave.\n\nI turned to go.\n\nAnd then I heard it.\n\n**Knock. Knock.**\n\nTwo sharp raps, loud enough to rattle inside my helmet.\n\nI whipped around, heart hammering. The door stood still.\n\nA voice followed. Faint. Garbled by the water.\n\n**\"Hello?\"**\n\nIt was human. Definitely human. And close. Far too close.\n\nAnother knock.  \nAnother voice. This one softer, female.\n\n**\"Please. Let us out.\"**\n\nI spun in the water, shining my light everywhere. Nobody. Just the door.\n\nAnother voice joined in, sounding like it came from behind me.\n\n**\"It’s cold. We can’t breathe.\"**\n\nThen a fourth. **\"You left us here.\"**\n\nMy limbs locked up. This wasn’t nitrogen narcosis. I knew the signs. I wasn’t hallucinating.\n\nI grabbed my line and started to follow it back toward the exit.

My light flickered. Something brushed past my leg, but when I whipped around, there was nothing.\n\nI should have kept going.  \nI should have ignored them.\n\nBut something inside me — a voice that sounded like my own — whispered, *Just open it. See what happens.*\n\nI turned back.\n\nThe door waited.\n\nI reached out and gripped the handle. It was warm, almost pulsing under my glove.\n\nI opened it.\n\nBehind the door was nothing.\n\nNot black water. Not stone. Just pure void. No up, no down. Like staring into the mouth of something ancient and patient.\n\nA blast of freezing air roared out, slamming into me. My mask fogged. My body convulsed with cold. The light on my helmet flickered and died.\n\nAnd then I heard it.\n\n**Running.**\n\nDozens of bare feet slapping against stone. Hundreds. A stampede. They moved all around me, though I still saw nothing.\n\nSomething brushed my shoulder. Fingers maybe. Or claws.\n\nThe chamber trembled. Cracks spread across the walls like spiderwebs.

Where we moved to, old equaled cheap, and as a former self-emancipated teen and current broke adult, cheap was almost too much to afford.  \n  \nI’m grateful that my friends helped me with the move. When I’d left my parents’ house for the last time, I took nothing but what could fit in a bag, the clothes on my back, and the money I’d earned through back breaking work at the factory my father had worked for over thirty years. The old man would’ve noticed if I’d taken anything more and being discreet was the only reason I got out of there without getting pummeled all over my scrawny body. Or worse. But maybe nothing is worse than the desert town called Halliton.\n\nFar away from any family, far away from most things, was Halliton. It was a Southward drive shy of an hour down into Santa Fe, where my new community college classes were, but far enough to feel alone in the world. The place, despite being so rural, felt like a literal oasis at the end of those absurdly long stretches of roads we took there in our cars, loaded up with stuff. I didn’t have much, never had. My friends – Rebecca, Martin, and Raul – agreed to help me take my stuff from my shitty old apartment and into Raul’s truck.\n\nBefore we moved, the four of us sat around my last apartment, eating Chinese food and watching some movie, when Raul said something we all resonated with, “We need to get out of fucking Oklahoma.”\n\nThat was all it took.\n\nThe houses around Harrow Hill road were spaced far apart, as it was with these older places. I’d been in a few towns like this when I lived in Oklahoma, usually near or in the woods. By the time we arrived on our property, it was after 10pm. The house loomed over us, feeling taller, larger in the dark. The windows were blacker than the night sky, and from even outside you could hear the occasional creaking and groaning of the house settling, like an old widow, perched on her hill, moving through the pains of time going by too fast around her. \n\nA two bedroom with a finished attic was somehow cheaper than anything else on the market, and I’d eventually understand why.\n\n“Warner,” Rebecca called for me at the top of the stairs within the first five minutes we started bringing boxes in. “You’re sure you’re all right with the loft? I mean, I know it makes sense for Martin and I to take it, but the thought of going up and down the stairs to check on the baby on the way, not to mention morning sickness. And it doesn’t have a lot of space to put your paint and easel…”\n\n“I’m okay with putting all that in the basement.” I told her matter-of-factly.\n\n“It’s not even finished.” She insisted.\n\n“Well, would you rather me get oil paint all over carpet, tile, or hardwood floor?”\n\nHer mouth drifted open as she considered it. “Guess you gotta point.”\n\n“Rare, I know.”\n\n“That’s, like, super cool of you, by the way. To give us the master bedroom.”\n\n“Well, you are two, almost three people occupying one space. You'll probably want your own bathroom. Hard to argue with the math.”\n\nIt took three, maybe four hours to get all our stuff inside the house, and by the time we got our mattresses in our respective rooms, none of us felt like unpacking anything beyond some pillows and blankets to make it through the night. We put together our cash and “nose go’d” that Martin would be the designated pickup of pizza and beer. He gave Becca a peck on the lips before heading out into the harsh winter cold with that ugly gray scarf of his.\n\nRebecca and Martin had been practically married for about ten years, but as high school sweethearts who had recently turned 20 (Martin) and 21 (Rebecca) they were only married on paper for about two. I met them in grade school, and we were recess friends. You know, usually the kind of kid from another class, another grade, or someone you just never talked to in your own class for some reason. We reconnected together while working an old job at a restaurant.\n\n“I think Monica’s into me,” Raul got himself a glass of water from the kitchen. He must have had the forethought to put some utensils and stuff in place at some point. “I know it’s long distance, but I think we can make it work. I’ll make enough at this new job to pay for flights back and forth.”\n\nRaul I met in high school. He popped a guy in the gut at a concert for some metalcore Linkin Park ripoff band for breaking my nose after I bumped into his beer hand. Nothing bound two guys together as brothers more than escorting the other over their shoulder to the hospital three blocks away. We couldn’t have learned more about one another that night than if we got piss-pantsing drunk in a parking lot past 11am, one of few pastimes in our old Midwest town.\n\n“And you assume this because…?” Becks arched a brow as he went back for more glasses for the two of us.\n\n“She kept rubbing my shoulder when we clocked in together in the office, and I’d caught her checking my pecs once or twice before my last day before going remote.”\n\n“Totally a litmus test for any successful relationship.”\n\n“Feh. Monica’s not one for *relationships*, and I think I’m okay with that. After Daisy cheated on me I’m kind of over searching for love. I just want to have fun.”\n\nIt was so obvious that Rebecca didn’t agree with that mindset. Neither of us expected she might. I’d been single my whole life at that point, not even a wishy-washy middle school girlfriend. I mean, I’d once gotten one of those rubber bracelets from a girl in my calc class, which gave me the butterflies, but seconds later got told she’d apparently smoked a joint before fifth period and was making them for everyone. Thus were the breaks in one’s teen years.\n\nIt didn’t matter to me, though. I was too busy keeping my nose to the grindstone while working on a degree in engineering and soon looking for a job. Last month, before moving, I was working at a family restaurant with Mart and Becca, which was kinda nice, but also not sustainable. I kept falling behind on job duties due to all-nighters studying and trying to maintain at least some hobbies. Like painting.\n\nI wasn’t sure if I was particularly good. Friends praised me, but I’ve never bothered to submit a portfolio or attend art fairs. Painting was exclusively for me. A skill and pastime all my own that no one could take away. It’s nice to have things like that, to have one thing that makes you feel whole. I still like painting despite all that’s happened.\n\nMartin returned with food and and a six pack like a knight showing up to save the day, and with an empty belly I particularly felt like a damsel in distress. Men could be damsels too, given the right circumstances. Rebecca, of course, had sparkling water instead. Three beautiful, greasy slices and two cheap beers later, and I was more than ready for bed. Martin and Rebecca were too, but in a different sort of way.\n\n“Keep the boinking sounds to a minimum when Warner and I are home, you spouses.” Raul stood up from the floor with a groan and a symphony of cracking from his back. Our sounds would be the same once we stood. “I’m going to crash so hard, glad I don’t start work until Monday.”\n\n“Me, too.” Martin and Rebecca agreed.\n\nI wasn’t so lucky, but I was used to going to class and working in all conditions at the community college I just transferred credits from. I had qualified for a partial scholarship at my new college, but the usual academic fuckery messed with getting me full grants for some reason, so I still owed half the tuition myself. I planned to spend all of tomorrow in Halliton looking for something that worked with my day classes.\n\nI flopped onto my classes, dreading the early morning of registering for Santa Fe Community College and all the tedious paperwork that would follow.\n\n…\n\nI found work pretty easily at the Gas n’ Get, the gas station convenience store near the edge of town. It was perfect, the overnight shift let me get to my classes in Santa Fe and back home in time to rest up before heading into work. Only my first shift in, and I knew pretty much the ins and outs. My boss, Frank, was laidback and the register was relatively automated for such a rural town.\n\nThat weekend, we had our first welcome at our house's front door. He was an older guy, I’d say fifties or sixties, judging by his graying roots and salt and pepper beard. His puffer vest over a long sleeve flannel and worn hunter’s canvas pants combo was sort of ageless in its own way, so it was hard to nail down what range of age he was. I grinned politely at him, more of a lips pulling back into an awkward line sort of expression. Pure Midwest behavior.\n\n“Hi, the name’s Daniel Spritcher. So, you’re the new neighbors. I met Mr. Perez before, but not you.” He meant Raul. He offered his hand, and I shook it. “I’m your landlord.”\n\nHe laughed as though it were obvious, but as Raul was the one who found the place and did most of the paperwork, the most the three of us had to do was sign the lease. Raul had plenty of flexibility to do all that as he worked virtually and had the free time to get us set up. He’d found our house for cheap, and the rest worked itself out from there.\n\n“Oh! Wow. Uh. Thanks for the intro,” I said awkwardly. “I’m Warner, by the way. Are you just stopping by to say hello, or is there something I can help you with?”\n\n“The wife and I live down the road, ‘bout a couple football fields distance that way,” he pointed eastward. “So you’re welcome to stop by for a cold one if we’re out back on a weekend night. Just built a new firepit for the backyard. Make helluva smores.”\n\n“That’s a kind offer, sir.”\n\n“We saw you moving in, Wanda and I, and, thing is…” The old man scratched his neck, already raw from other scratches. I tried not to stare. “Young people, moving somewhere like this, we wonder if…I know you won’t volunteer the truth when I ask this if it’s true, but are you four in some kind of trouble? Running from someone? The law?”\n\n“Oh, God no.” I balked and waved my hands quickly. “No, uh, we’re just looking for a fresh start.”\n\n“Not the first I’ve heard of something like that, but almost never for our town. Guess I should have suspected that when I listed the house online after the last ones rented. Thought I’d try to keep up with the times. Listen, this is driving me crazy. Sorry, if this is awkward, but the more we talk…” More scratching, a little more aggressive. “I recognize you, somehow. You ever been around here before?”\n\n“No, sir.\" I was taken a bit aback by the question. \"First time here.”\n\n“Right, right. I remember Raul mentioning that. Never lived nearby? I used to substitute at a high school in Pecos.”\n\n“No, we’ve all lived in the west edge of Oklahoma our whole lives. I worked the graveyard shift at the Gas n’ Get last night, first day, maybe you saw me there?” Though I thought I would have recognized him if that were the case, there was no accounting for memory issues.\n\n“Strange. Graveyard shift, you said? No, I was most surely in bed by that time. Well, nice meeting you. Offer still stands for free beer and good company, maybe pizza from Andretti's on Wren Street – you *are* old enough to drink, right?” He asked quickly.\n\n“For a couple years,” I laughed.\n\n“Good, know you guys like beer. A six pack and pizza always hits the spot.”\n\nI furrowed my brow a little at that, amused how accurate he was about move-in night. Were twenty-somethings easy to clock as still having their college tastes?  \n  \n\"Well, be seeing ya.\"\n\nHe nodded and left, pulling the collar of his vest up to his ears as the winds blew sharper with the coming night.\n\n…\n\nWeeks went by, and I was well into the groove of working the graveyard shift. I left there to go to my only class that morning, and I finally returned home around 11am.\n\nHave you ever had the feeling of knowing someone is home, even if you’re on your own in another room and everything's quiet? I wondered if that was tied to the human animal’s sense of surviving predators in prehistoric times. The knowing one's being watched. Some leftover primal instinct embedded in our DNA.\n\nThe only car parked around the house was my own. Unlikely anyone but me was home. I tried to shake it, but I ended up sleeping on the sofa. New place jitters. I hadn’t lived in a house in about five years, and assumed it was the size, the emptiness, that got to me.\n\nI dicked around on my phone for a few before putting on some podcast to fall asleep to. I’m the kind of person that can’t sleep without noise. As I was falling asleep, I heard someone loudly moving overhead, but was too close to dreaming to wake up.  \n  \nThen someone *was* home, but how? Did one of the three walk home? Did Martin drop off Rebecca, or the reverse? Whoever it was went down the stairs, then back up, then down again, then back up. They were clearly searching through everything, there was so much thumping that I was sure they’d retrieved something huge from their room. Outrageously loud. I sat up and was rightfully annoyed.\n\n“Who the fuck is up there?” I called loud enough to reach upstairs.\n\nNo answer.  I figured it was Raul. I’d seen him leave earlier with his backpack. And I'd recognized the smell of his outrageously expensive cologne. As Raul’s remote in coding, he preferred to work at libraries and coffee shops for ambient noise. The only options he’d have in this town were a small library, a few coffee shops, a diner, or a couple little bar restaurants that seemed reserved for nicer meals out. Ermaline’s, where Becca and Martin had just been happily brought onto staff with.\n\nI was about to come up the stairs when Raul came down, in a major hurry.\n\n“Hey, man –” He brushed past me, cutting me off.\n\nHe made a sort of grunt in replacement of a real greeting or answer, and went out the door with a slam. In hindsight, despite going upstairs he had nothing in his hands. All that heavy thumping and dragging, things falling, and nothing to show for it? For that matter, why had he come home? *How* had he come home? Did he really walk back? Park down the road for some reason?\n\nDespite these questions, I didn’t bother to check if he had driven in or what. If he’d taken even a minute to talk to me, I might have offered him a ride back into town. I went back to the couch, fuming at how rudely I’d been awoken. Despite my rage, I somehow fell asleep.\n\nI woke to the sound of Mart and Becks coming home, laughing and taking off their coats. They, at least, had the decency to look ashamed when they’d realized they’d woken me up.\n\n“Hey, guys.” I rubbed my tired eyes.\n\n“Hey, bud, get enough sleep?” Martin was always concerned about my irregular sleep patterns, a real health nut.\n\n“About six hours. I only had one class today.” I stretched and stood up. Only 5 o’clock, and it was already pitch black outside, but that wasn’t surprising for winter. “How was work?”\n\n“Monotony.” Martin answered bluntly. \"Can't wait to rent a spot to open a practice.\"\n\nMartin had formal training in holistic chiropracting. A little pretentious, but at least he was helpful, not pushy about supplements and whatever.\n\n“But we’re meeting a lot of people! Great tips when it’s the biggest restaurant in town.” Rebecca said happily. “Speaking of! We brought home baked ziti for dinner. Hungry?”\n\nOf course I was. We were near finished with the meal when Raul came home, and I remembered the cold shoulder he’d left with after he rampaged upstairs. When he came into the dining room, I put my fork down a little more forcefully than I should have. This caught his attention.\n\n“Hey,” I looked up at him with annoyance, and he was taken aback. “What was up with this afternoon? All that, and you wouldn’t say two words to me? Are you angry at me or something?”\n\nHe furrowed his brow. “What are you on about? This afternoon?”\n\n“You went upstairs, you started moving things around, dropping things. Woke me up with it and left after grunting at me like some douchebag.”\n\n“Whoa,” Martin spoke up, hand up in a gesture for me to pull back. “Warn, you got it all wrong.”\n\n“Really? Seemed pretty clear to me.”\n\n“Bud,” Raul kept looking at me as if I were a stranger. “I never came back home today.”\n\nThat didn’t compute in my brain. “Dude, there’s no way, I *saw* you.”\n\n“Well,” Rebecca spoke up. “I mean, it’s true, War. He was at the restaurant all day.”\n\nI struggled to piece that together with the reality I’d experienced. It was absolutely Raul. I’d seen him, smelled his cologne in the air, he’d brushed against my shoulder as he’d left. But, I mean, I was asleep when he’d supposedly come home. It was *possible* I’d dreamt it, but still.\n\n“Look, have you been upstairs?” Raul offered.\n\n“No…” I hesitated. “I went back to sleep.”\n\n“Well, if I was doing what you said, it would probably be a mess, somewhere. Let’s go upstairs and check it out.”\n\nI followed him up the stairs. First, to the right, the hall bathroom. Nothing, everything in order. Then the master bedroom. Everything was intact, but frankly it didn’t seem Raul’s style to tear up someone else’s space. Next was his room. Same as last night when we’d played Xbox together, everything but his blankets were in their usual place.\n\n“See?” Raul said with finality. “Now will you drop it? You’re weirding me out, man.”\n\n“I…” I rubbed the back of my neck, confusion making my head spin. “Yeah. I mean, yeah. I’m sorry. I guess it was just a dream, or something.”\n\n“Sleepwalking,” Martin offered. “Your sleep hygiene has been all over the place. Maybe you’re still adjusting to the new sleep schedule.”\n\n“Right, yeah. But, just to be sure, let’s check my room?”\n\n“Hold on, you’d think I’d fuck with your stuff? As, what, a prank?”\n\nI was already up the stairs by the time he’d asked. My heart thudded in my chest, not just from the sprint upward.\n\n“Whoa,” Raul joined, and Martin came up the stairs to peer around him. “Wait, hold the fuck on, I *did not* do this!”\n\nMy room was trashed. My bedding was all rumpled, half on the floor, pillows scattered around. My drawers were rifled through, clothes tossed haphazardly in the direction of the door, even my curtain rod was pulled from the window.\n\n“Raul!” I was livid, I started getting to work cleaning, beginning with the curtain rod, but I was so frustrated I ended up fumbling with it and just threw it to the floor. “Why the fuck would you do this?”\n\n“I swear I didn’t!” He had his hands over his chest, eyes wide and wild. “I was gone all day, dude!”\n\nMartin put himself between me and Raul with clear intention to diffuse the coming fight between us. Truly a future dad skill coming into play, stopping a childish fight.\n\n“Stop. Obviously *someone* came inside the house. Or…I mean, it’s possible that you might have been asleep but still moving, Warner…” The silence filled in the blanks on his thought process.\n\n“No way, I was not sleep walking! I – I woke up in the same position I fell asleep in! My phone in my hand, earbuds plugged into the charge port.”\n\n“If someone did come in, why was the door unlocked?” Rebecca asked from the bottom of the stairs.\n\n“They probably used the key under the mat,” Raul ran his hand over his face. “We’ll need to find a new spot for it, it’s the most obvious place anyone could hide one. I just didn’t think it would be an issue in a town like this. Should we report it?”\n\n“There wouldn’t be much they can do…” Martin thought a moment as I stuffed things back into the drawers. “I’ll go into town tomorrow and get one of those video doorbells. It doesn’t fix much tonight, but it might make us feel safer. We’ll bring the spare key inside, make sure the doors and windows are locked, and make it work 'til morning.”\n\n“Oh my God,” Rebecca started freaking out downstairs. “I can’t believe this is happening. We *just* moved here.”\n\n“No one took anything,” I answered with finality. “My watches, my silver chain, my gaming stuff. It’s all here. Maybe I was sleepwalking. Or…I dunno. Something happened. Martin’s right. We’ll get a camera. Could’ve been some idiot punk kids. I’ll talk to the landlord.”\n\n“You’ve met him?” Raul asked as Martin went downstairs to comfort his wife.\n\n“Yeah, the other day. Seems like a nice guy. Lives down the road about five minute’s walk away, he said.”\n\n“Wouldn’t hurt to bring it up.” Raul stress sighed. “Warner, I’m sorry. This really sucks. I’d never do this to you, man.”\n\n“It’s fine,” I ran a hand through my hair. “Let’s just make sure everything is locked. You guys get some sleep while I’m at work.”\n\n“Tell Barb I say hi,” Martin chuckled. The stories I’d told about my favorite regular could fill a book, and I’d only been working at Gas ‘n Get for about a month.\n\n…\n\n\n\nThat night, the gas station shift was going by like normal. I actually liked the overnight shift. It paid hella well for what it was, and I was sort of enjoying the zen of stocking shelves with nothing but the sound of humming refrigerators and the occasional trucker making a snack or piss run before heading out on the road. I’d probably like being a truck driver, if it weren’t for the fact I was determined to get that degree.\n\nCohan, a regular who showed up around two AM most nights in his eighteen wheeler, and always bought out the Corn Nuts from their peg. I hated those things, but he said they went well with his smokes, of which he bought two packs of as well. Who was I to hate on someone’s road snacks? He was a big guy, the quiet type. He was the kind of guy who concealed carried but in a comforting way, the sort to put you behind him before he pulled the trigger.\n\nI was busying myself refilling the Corn Nuts that Cohan had bought out when Barb came in. Sometimes I wondered if she sat out in the parking lot to wait for the store to be empty.\n\n“Hey, hey, Warner.” She greeted in that gravelly country accent of hers.\n\n“Evening, Barb. How’s the weather on the roads like?” Being a notch up into the mountains, a winter night here could sometimes drop down to the cold of a Midwest winter day, still bitter and cutting.\n\n“If I had any balls they’d be puckered up and fallen off frozen,” she answered. “Trucks don’t hold no heat, even the newfangled ones. Looked at the forecast and read my cards, clear skies all the way through the weekend. Not like we’ve really had snow around here in years.”\n\nI wanted her to be right, and usually she was. She and her Tarot cards were more accurate about things past, present, and future than any hackneyed psychic could ever be.\n\nHonestly, Barb was just flat out cool. She sported a jet black bob hairstyle (which I frankly thought was a wig) that contrasted starkly against her pale skin. Her clothes and accessories were straight out of a hippie stoner’s dream wardrobe. Crystals hung on hemp and rope around her neck, dreamcatcher earrings dangled from the sides of her head, and rings of all kinds of stones adorned nearly every finger. She was a time capsule of the 70s.\n\nOld enough to be my grandma, but her arms were scattered with tattoos. God, I wanted her to *be* my grandma.\n\nDespite being just about five foot tall, she was able to knock back enough Red Bull in a night to put me to shame. She’d pulled a few flavors by the time I met her at the register. Those, plus a packet of snack cakes were her usual purchase of choice. We kept up our typical kind of conversation, until she said something that struck me.\n\n“You smell all kinds of wrong.”\n\nI cringed. Guess I should have showered before I’d come in, and the smell of sweat lingered on me as if I’d just come in from the rain. Then I squinted.\n\n“Wrong?” It was such an odd way to phrase someone’s bodily smell. “How do you mean?”\n\n“Strange,” she added, with absolutely no clarification. “Something new happened.” It wasn’t a question, which unnerved me.\n\n“Uh,” my tongue flicked over my lower lip in thought. “I don’t really know, everything is the same as it has been for a while. School, home, work. Rinse and repeat.”\n\n“Today. Something happened today.”\n\nI laughed, used to her eccentricities. She’d recently offered me a genuine rabbit's foot to pass an assignment, which I borrowed (in a plastic baggie), and passed, but that was based purely on how much work I’d put into studying. When I’d returned it, she rubbed salt over it and put it back into its original cloth satchel.\n\nRealization killed my laughter, though.\n\n“I guess. Yeah, something happened.”\n\nI told her about earlier that day. How I’d been asleep and ended up feeling like I was going crazy so soon after I’d woken up. I’d tried to put it behind me all night while working, focusing my energy on the moment instead of my mind. I was pretty good at that. I knew a lot of people had a problem with clearing out thoughts to meditate, but I never really had that problem. If anything, the whole head emptying thing was almost a problem of its own.\n\n“You ever sleepwalked before?”\n\nI shook my head. “Not to my knowledge.”\n\n“Mmmm…” The sound was grainy coming from behind her closed, thin lips. “That’s bad news. Doubt it’s sleepwalking. Could’ve been, of course, but ain't very likely if you never experienced it before. Mind if I read my cards?”\n\n“You keep them on you all the time?” I arched a brow as she pulled them from her purse.\n\n“They work good when they soak up my vibrations.” \n\nOkay. Made total sense. I think.\n\nShe pulled a cigarette from her bag and held it between her lips as she rifled for her Tarot deck. By the time she pulled them out, her pink lipstick smudged up half the cigarette and smeared a little onto the skin around her mouth.\n\n“There we go. Let me shuffle 'em.”\n\nShe set the box down on the counter and started maneuvering the cards as smoothly as a dealer at a casino. In a way, Tarot card reading kind of felt like gambling; hoping for a good hand, wanting the results to be just the pull you’d need to fulfill your desires. She had me pull three from a handful of ten, took them back, and laid them out face up. The only one I could recognize was The Tower, the other two were sort of faded, probably from years of use.\n\nBarb gnawed gently on the butt of her cigarette.\n\n“Upside down,” she tapped The Tower with the back of her knuckle. “Something’s off. Obstacles, bit o' misfortune in the air, coming hard times. This one,” she tapped on another, “Five of swords. Means someone’s working to get ahead by any means necessary. Foul motives. Lastly. The Hanged Man.”\n\n“That one sounds kind of not great,” I grit my teeth.\n\n“It means sacrifice, dying to oneself and one’s needs for a necessary change. Misfortune, misdeed, martyrdom. The intention for this reading was for revelation, now it’s time for interpretation. Want to try first? Often, the one read to can have more insight than the deck dealer.”\n\nI considered it a moment. This was Barb’s best ability, that she could convince even a stout skeptic for even one minute to consider her mysticism as possible. I never considered myself a skeptic or believer, but Barb was closest to pulling me to one side over the other.\n\n“Foul motives, I have no clue about. Obstacles, difficulty, maybe balancing both work and school?”\n\n“A bit shallow.” Barb muttered, and I felt judged, which egged me on to try again.\n\n“What happened today…” I ventured. “Might happen again. Or be the first of something. I should ask Mr. Spritcher about it tomorrow.”\n\n“Spritcher?” Barb echoed. “Why him?”\n\n“He’s our landlord.”\n\n“Oh, God.” Barb closed her eyes, the butt of the unlit cigarette now squished between her teeth. “I should have put two and two to make four. There’s just so many houses up for rent as the youngers move out for big cities. It’s that house on Harrow Hill?”\n\n“Uh, yeah?”\n\n“I guess it figures he wouldn’t have said anything, that weasel Spritcher. He bought up that property six, seven years ago and has been renting it out ever since.”\n\n“Sounds kind of standard?”\n\n“No one sticks around there for long. Even before that idiot bought it, it had a reputation. Kid, if you talk to almost anyone in town over the age of fifty, they could tell you all about that place. Its history. What we know of it, at least.”\n\n“Its history?”\n\n“Anyone who’s lived there ends up leaving. Whether because they pass in the house, someone else passes away inside, or they just…disappear. Warner, it’s a house that has its own name and it’s earned it for good reason.”\n\nMy throat was stuck, thick, gluey. “And that name is?”\n\n“They call it The House of Graves.”\n\nI lay awake that morning, no classes. Thinking, thinking, thinking. I thought about Mr. Spritcher. About Barb. The house. God, the house. And Raul, what happened last afternoon.\n\nI couldn't blame Spritcher for not divulging the track record of the tenancy. Who would want to live in a place that couldn't hold onto a renter under those questionable, and alarming, circumstances? And Barb, what she told me about the house itself, her insane accuracy on all things metaphysical. And Raul. I ran that interaction, that bizarre moment, the inexplicable outcome, all over and over in my head.\n\nI curled up onto my side, face in my hands as I tried to think. Any detail, any extra scrap, a thread of remembrance to pull things together and make it all make sense.\n\nThen, it struck me.\n\nThrough the veil of sleep, either the sleep of that afternoon, or the one that overtook me in the moment, I saw it. Clear as someone standing before me. Clear as a voice right in my ear. Unmistakable as if someone called my name. Somehow, it had blotted from my mind, smeared away from the canvas of my memory like oil paint with a painter's palette knife.\n\nIt *was* Raul.\n\nBut he didn't have a face."},"26":{"title":"I Hear My Mom Calling Me From the Basement [Part 2]","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kb1kld\/i_hear_my_mom_calling_me_from_the_basement_part_2\/","flair":"Series","author":"Popular-Ruin521","selftext":"\\-[Part 1](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k8medw\/i_hear_my_mom_calling_me_from_the_basement\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\\-  \n  \nI’m writing this from my closet.\n\nI don't know where else to go.  \nWhen the footsteps reached my bedroom door, I did the only thing I could think of — I slipped into the closet and pulled the door shut behind me, trying not to make a sound.\n\nI’m still not sure if it saw me.\n\nFor a while, it was just standing there.  \nI could hear its breathing — a wet, ragged sound, like someone struggling to suck air through waterlogged lungs.\n\nThe air inside the closet is hot and stale. I can smell old laundry, dust, my own sweat. Every breath feels too loud, like it’s echoing off the walls. I pressed my back against the far corner, squeezing myself as small as possible between the hanging coats.\n\nThen it spoke.\n\nNot a knock. Not a whisper.  \nIt spoke, low and broken, right outside my door.\n\n\"Let me in, sweetheart. I'm so cold.\"\n\nIt sounded wrong. The words hit the wrong notes in my ears, like someone playing a familiar song on an out-of-tune piano.  \nThe voice had a shape to it, if that makes any sense — thick and heavy, like it was trying to force its way under the door and wrap itself around me.\n\nI pressed my hand over my mouth to keep from making a sound.  \nTears stung the corners of my eyes, but I didn’t dare let out even a sniffle.\n\nAfter a long moment, the door handle jiggled.  \nSoftly at first, then harder.  \nLike it was testing how much pressure it would take to snap the lock.\n\nI don’t know why — maybe some leftover instinct — but I started whispering a prayer under my breath.  \nI haven’t been religious in years. Neither had my mom, really.  \nBut right then, it was the only thing I could think to do.  \nThe words felt shaky and unfamiliar, like trying to walk a path I’d forgotten.\n\nEventually, the rattling stopped.\n\nNow... it's quiet.  \nToo quiet.\n\nI want to believe it’s gone. I want to believe I’m safe to come out.  \nBut I can feel it.\n\nSomething is still out there, just beyond the door, waiting.  \nI can see its shadow through the gap at the bottom — a thick, unmoving smudge that blocks the hallway light completely.\n\nThe closet is getting colder.\n\nThe thin fabric of my pajama pants clings to my skin, damp with sweat. My hands are trembling so badly I almost dropped my phone while typing this.\n\nAnd worse — when I strained to listen a second ago, I heard something else.\n\nAnother voice.\n\nFrom the direction of the basement.\n\nFaint... but this time, not calling for me.\n\nIt was calling to something.\n\nI couldn’t catch the words. Just the tone — low, urgent, almost pleading.\n\nWhatever it said, the thing outside my closet heard it — because just now, it started moving again.\n\nBut not like footsteps this time.  \nIt’s dragging itself.\n\nSlowly, heavily, across the floorboards, as if its legs don’t work properly.  \nThere’s a sticky, scraping noise with every pull.  \nThe sound of something too heavy, too broken, trying to crawl toward me.\n\nCloser.\n\nCloser.\n\nThe closet door creaked just now.\n\nI can see the edge of the handle shifting slightly, almost imperceptibly.\n\nI’m holding my breath so hard my chest hurts.  \nMy heart is pounding so loud, I'm sure it can hear it.\n\nI don’t know how much longer I can stay quiet.  \nI don’t know if it’s waiting for me to scream — or if it’s just playing with me before it forces its way inside.\n\nIf I survive this... if there’s even a chance... I’ll update again.\n\nBut if you don’t hear from me —  \nif this is the last thing I post —\n\nPlease.\n\nDon’t answer when the basement calls you."},"27":{"title":"Orion Pest Control: Good News, We're Getting A House","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kalju8\/orion_pest_control_good_news_were_getting_a_house\/","flair":"Series","author":"adorabletapeworm","selftext":"[Previous case](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/s\/T0WoSJQkfn)\n\nI don't mean to sound ungrateful towards the Hunters for the seeds, because I truly am appreciative. When it comes to prosthetics from our world, they cost an arm and a leg (pun intended, die mad about it), especially for the options that are waterproof and capable of the complex motions I need for my job. \n\nThat being said, it certainly is something to have a plant growing out of your arm. Or more accurately, *within* it. \n\n(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/s\/OpNHnxiz8U)\n\nWhen the seeds first took root, I *felt* it. A slithering sensation beneath the still-healing skin, followed by the bright, blinding pain of them burrowing into my marrow. My arm had cramped up afterwards, my breath catching as fire flowed through my veins as my blood became theirs. Each beat of my heart fed them as they began their growth. In short, it wasn't entirely dissimilar to how it feels to be caught up in Briar's thorns. \n\nNow that I've felt both and have a basis of comparison, I have to wonder if they're related in some way. Or maybe it's like how hares and rabbits look similar, but are actually on completely different branches on the evolutionary tree. \n\nBefore leaving the Houndmaster's home, the mechanic had given me some pointers  to reduce the possibility of rejection. The one that helped the most was that sunlight can help soothe the ‘growing pains,’ as he'd called them. Sure enough, the moment the afternoon rays touched my arm, the roots spreading through my vasculature like tentacles eased their travel somewhat. The anguish didn't go away completely, but it became much more manageable. \n\nHowever, there was one day during this hellish week where it downpoured for nearly the whole day. The seeds took it out on me, causing breath-taking cramps that I could feel radiating up to my elbow. Reyna ended up running out to find an indoor plant lamp because of how bad it got. It helps in a pinch, though natural sunlight seems to be more potent.   \n\nAs terrible as the pain was, it wasn't the most disconcerting part, in my personal opinion.\n\nAt around two in the morning, roughly three days after implantation, I was torn out of a dream about being back in high school by a maddening, burning itch, right at the tip of the stump. At first, I thought it was that damned phantom limb shit again, but it went deeper. Far more than the typical irritation that I was already getting too familiar with. \n\nNow that I was wide awake from nerves, I crept out of bed and ducked into the bathroom, not wanting to disturb Deirdre or Reyna. They’d done enough for me since I got hurt; the least I could do to repay them is let them have one night of uninterrupted sleep. Heart pounding, I took a seat on the side of the bathtub, bracing myself for the worst. As I unwound the dressing covering the end of my arm, my mind tortured me with unwanted images of skin blackened by gangrene despite knowing I'd followed my doctor's and Briar's instructions to a T. \n\nAfter taking numerous deep breaths in an effort to slow the pounding of my heart, I uncovered my arm. The start of a small, red stem was growing from my wrist. I had to look away. \n\nLeaving it uncovered made it hurt less. Helped with the itch, too. Don't get me wrong, I know this is a good thing; the seeds were working without complication. But I couldn't look at the plant arising from my body without feeling sick.  \n\nThere were concerned weed whacker noises outside the shut bathroom door, accompanied by some scuffling. In the brief time we've had our two new roomies, Fireball has demonstrated an uncanny ability to know when someone is in desperate need of cuddles. I let her in then reached down, letting her sniff my hand, then scratched her behind the ear when she headbutted me comfortingly. \n\nIn the end, I loosely covered the stump and stem up with an oven mitt while Fireball acted as my little furry shadow, following me to and from the kitchen. Sleep wasn't happening for me that night, so I just laid in bed, staring at the ceiling as the little skunk snoozed, stretched out like an accordion between my legs. \n\nMost of my week has been spent watching impatiently as the stem got longer. Over time, it became an intricate network of spiderwebbing branches roughly the same size as what my natural hand had been. By that point, the phantom aches had become replaced with a harsh sting that had started out as tolerable, but gradually escalated. There were days when the pain made me immobile, even after covering them. It did help marginally, though even the light brushes of gauze were excruciating. The prescription-strength ibuprofen my doctor gave me didn't put a dent in it. \n\nRaw nerves. The branches were replicating nerves without having skin to cover them yet. It felt as if every molecule in the air was abrading the area with the intensity of sandpaper. I couldn't decide if the constant sensation of being flayed was better or worse than fluctuating between imaginary itches and nothing. \n\nBriar had stopped by between calls to check on my healing progress. At the time, Reyna and Deirdre were at work, and truthfully, I was bored out of my mind with nothing to do but check realty websites. For the most part, Fireball is great company, but she likes attention on her terms, and if she's not in the mood, she *will* let you know. \n\nThe puffball was loafing about in the sun, pretending like I didn't exist, when I heard a knock. As I was getting up to check the peephole, like fucking clockwork, my neighbor's door flew open. *That's* an aspect of apartment life I won't mind leaving behind. While the walls are rather thin in these units, they aren't nearly as sound conductive as he seems to think that they are. \n\nUpon discussion with the person in the unit on the other side of him, the miserable old bastard is just as unpleasant to her and her two toddlers as he is to us. Then to top it off, I caught him staring at Deirdre's behind as she walked past the other day. Creep wasn't even subtle about treating her like she was a prize cutlet at the local butcher. \n\nWhich brings us to when he got on Briar's bad side. \n\nI didn’t hear the first part of the crotchety bastard's gripe, just the last of his sentence: “-people coming and going at all hours of the day!”\n\nWithout any hesitation whatsoever, Briar coolly replied, “Like how I did in your daughter last year?”\n\n*Oh, dear God.*\n\nBefore this dispute could descend even further into middle school territory, I loudly interjected, “Hi! Inside! *Now!*”\n\nLeaving my neighbor red-faced and cursing at his back, the Hunter followed me inside. \n\n“Are you trying to get me evicted?!” I hissed, trying to keep my voice down. \n\nBriar apparently didn't share my desire for discretion, narrowing his eyes as he glanced around at the apartment judgmentally. “If that happened, you’d owe me a favor. I've seen cardboard boxes with more sturdy construction than this. The box would be more private, too. You know he presses a shot glass up to the wall to hear you better, right?”\n\nThat caught my attention. “He does *what now?*”\n\n“You could always have some fun with it,” He suggested with a mischievous smile that I saw far too many times while he was implanting the seeds the previous week. “Make him regret listening in on you. Put on a little puppet show! Make him think that you're all in a murder cult together.”\n\n*You mean the Wild Hunt?*\n\nWith no intention of following his terrible advice, I replied, “Can you please check my hand before you get me kicked out?”\n\nSnickering, he nodded towards my left arm. “Alright, let's see what I'm working with.”\n\nUnwrapping the gauze was a slow, excruciating process. It was hard not to wince at even the lightest of touches against the sensitive pseudo-tissue. Briar had to step in after a moment. Making me sit down as he delicately did the rest. It got to be too much once the branches were exposed to the elements once again. \n\n“It's looking good,” he remarked, then began fishing something out of his pocket. “I’m sure it doesn't *feel* good, but it's progressing exactly like how it's supposed to. No signs of infection or rejection, which is what we want.”\n\nAfter producing an amber vial topped with a dropper, he went on to explain that the muscles had already started to form, as well as the other associated connective tissues. Afterwards, flesh would follow, then the screams of my nerves would subside. \n\n“In the meantime, this'll help with the discomfort,” Briar informed me as he offered me the vial. “No more than two drops each day. And it tastes horrible, so brace yourself. I recommend lime juice as a chaser. The acidity neutralizes the bitterness.”\n\nExamining the bottle, I asked, “What is it?” \n\n“A painkiller from our world. Not eye of newt, if that's what you're afraid of. We also made sure to hold the snips, snails, and *puppy dog* tails.”\n\nShithead. \n\nTrying not to get snippy with him, I urged, “Please? I prefer to know what is going into my body before ingesting it.” \n\nHe appeared to be fighting the impulse to roll his eyes, but elaborated. “It's sap from one of the captain's willows. Isn't learning fun?”\n\nNo. But I wasn't in a place to refuse, despite how disturbing the source of this tincture was. Two drops of it did what modern medicine couldn't, taking the scream in my new nerves down to a throbbing hum. For the first time since the stinging began, I could properly breathe.\n\nBefore he departed, I tried to ask about the spear Reyna had retrieved. As expected, he didn't have the authority to answer. My best guess at the time was that it was intended to be used against Gwythyr, in some regard. \n\nAs far as the spear goes, its description matched that of a legendary weapon that I remembered from the old stories Grandma used to tell me. Such a weapon was said to be wielded by the god, Lugh, but upon doing some digging, a similar enchanted spear was said to have been used by one of Cú Chulainn's adversaries, Dubthach Doéltenga. However, one notable difference between the two is that the latter had to be bathed in blood in order to keep the spear from killing whoever wielded it, whereas the one Reyna took was found in water. And given the history lesson Iolo gave her about the tower, I'm thinking that this was Lugh's weapon. Though, it is worth mentioning that there are some sources that insist that they're the same weapon under different names. \n\nForgive the infodump. I have literally nothing better to do until Reyna and Deirdre get off of work, so I'm making it everyone else's problem. \n\nAnyways, both spears – whether it's Gae Assail or Lúin of Celtchar – were said to be devastating in battle, capable of decimating enemies from afar with unbeatable precision. It was also said that the tips of both spears would burst into flames if a battle was nigh.\n\nA battle such as Calan Mai. \n\nWas this Iolo's way of trying to end things between Gwyn and Gwythyr once and for all? Or was this for something else? \n\nA few days after skin started to grow on my hand, I finally had the energy to entertain the idea of having a long talk with the Hunters about how we were all going to move forward. By that point, the stinging had mostly subsided. It was still so horribly tender that exposing it to the open air hurt like a bitch, but it was a vast improvement over what I'd been experiencing prior. Even more significant was that I could actually move the branches.\n\nIt's hard to describe, but it still doesn't feel like *my* hand, or a hand at all, for that matter. I can maneuver it decently enough, but it's like I've got weights on the end of each finger. I've accepted that with my hand being gone and this being a new appendage entirely, this offputting sensation could be due to the fact that I have no muscle memory. Using it feels slow. Clumsy.  \n\nIt looks odd as well. The ‘flesh’ is a deep red when I'm properly hydrated and able to photosynthesize. It has a distinctly smooth, waxy texture that was reminiscent of sturdy leaves rather than skin. There are nail beds, but nothing resembling a fingernail to cover them. If you look closely, you can see what appears to be veins in the translucent pseudo-skin. In other words, it's obvious that it's a prosthetic, albeit one my ‘arms dealer’ wouldn't recognize. \n\nWhen Deirdre, Reyna and I went to check out a house for rent, the landlord kept looking at it when he thought I wasn't paying attention. Begrudgingly, I accepted that was something I most likely was going to have to get used to. I ended up putting it behind my back in an effort to keep it out of his sight, but the fucker still kept staring. \n\nBefore I could tell him off, Deirdre did it for me, albeit far more gracefully than I would have. \n\n“Staring is rather impolite, don't you think?” she said with a disapproving frown. \n\nHe flushed, instantly tearing his gaze away from my pocketed left hand. Without apology, he breezily kept crowing about the newly renovated living room, the granite counter tops, and *oh,* did you notice the crown molding that was original to the house? \n\nNo. I didn't. Something else had caught my attention. While we were walking through, a window flew open seemingly on its own. \n\n“Oh! That happens sometimes!” He chirped as he rushed over to close it. “You know how old houses are.”\n\nAll three of us shared equal expressions of skepticism with one another. \n\n“Is there… *something* already living in this house?” Reyna asked carefully. \n\n*Or not living.*\n\n“Oh, you mean like ghosts?” the landlord said with a chuckle that he'd probably meant to sound dismissive, but it was a bit too high in pitch to be convincing. “That’s just local talk!”\n\n“And what, exactly, do the ‘locals' say?” I questioned, scanning the room to see if anything was amiss. \n\nThe place looked spotless. Streaks were visible in the freshly vacuumed blue carpet. The wooden cabinets in the kitchen shone from a recent treatment. There wasn't even a hint of dust on the windowsill. Could be evidence of Housekeeper activity, or the landlord found a solid cleaning company to spiffy the place up before showing it off. All in all, unless he fessed up, we didn't have much to go off of. \n\nThe landlord waved my inquiry off. “Oh, it's all superstitious nonsense. Nothing worth repeating.”\n\n“Let us be the judge of that,” I retorted. “By law, you have to disclose any ongoing infestations to prospective renters. That includes the ones that seem unbelievable to most people.”\n\nAs he sucked air, Reyna chimed in, eyes still flitting around cautiously, “Has anyone died here?”\n\nHe shrugged again, then with a shake of his head, answered in a failed attempt at nonchalance. “Yes, there were some deaths that occurred, but that was *years* ago! Longer than any of you have been alive.”\n\nDeirdre looked like she wanted to make a comment, but thought better of it. It probably was the wiser choice, but she did pass up a golden opportunity to mess with this slimeball. \n\n“What kind of deaths?” I pressed. “Murders? And what were the ages of the victims?”\n\nHe gave me a sour look. “Seems a bit morbid to ask questions like that, don't you think?”\n\nPatiently, I replied, “Sir, we're pest control specialists. Whatever this is, we can deal with it. We just need to know what it is.”\n\n“Deal with *what?*” He balked with a forced laugh. “There's *nothing* to deal-”\n\nAt precisely that moment, somewhere in the house, a baby began to cry. \n\nIt wasn't the typical cry of a fussy infant at the grocery store. More distressed. Shrill. Reyna was shrinking into herself, her hand over her heart as the lights began to flicker in time with the infantile shrieks. Deirdre was still, eyes wide and locked onto the floor, her pretty red lips drawn together in a tight line. The blood had drained from the landlord's face. His hands were shaking. \n\nNot a Housekeeper after all. One of its cousins. \n\nThese Neighbors tend to stay close to hearths and fireplaces, preferring the warmth of a fire over anything else. In homes that don't have such amenities, they often settle for furnaces or hang out by radiators, depending on the age of the house.  \n\nAs such, I asked the landlord, “Is there a fireplace?”\n\nHe blinked, then worked his mouth as if he’d been so spooked by the cries that he'd forgotten how to speak. “A what?”\n\nAt my question, the screams took on a much more grating tone, causing me to grimace. It didn't like the idea of me looking for it. \n\nFor the most part, the treatment plans for Housekeepers and Redjackets are identical. As long as you leave them to their own devices and offer them some cream, they'll reward your kindness. Though, Redjackets are also known to enjoy slices of bread as well. One of the biggest differences between the two is that unlike Housekeepers, Redjackets don't transform when agitated like our favorite, self-appointed maids. That being said, they are still dangerous, especially when provoked. \n\nTwo springs ago, a client didn’t like the advice we gave him and chose to take matters into his own hands. He located the Redjacket and tried to shoo it away by dumping a pot full of boiling water onto it. \n\nThe next day, the client was found by his brother, chopped up and boiling on the stove in that same pot. \n\n“A fireplace,” I repeated patiently. “Or a hearth, of some sort. Somewhere warm.”\n\n“Uh, yeah. In the basement.”\n\nAfter telling him to stay where he was, I approached the only door we hadn't gone through yet. Deirdre opted to tag along while Reyna remained with him. \n\nThe cries increased in volume as I passed through. And became much angrier. The screams grated like glass between metal gears. The light switch for the basement didn't work. Before I made my descent into darkness, Deirdre's hand appeared on my shoulder. A light, comforting weight. \n\nAfter steeling myself for the first atypical infestation I've contended with since my injury, I called down the stairs, “Can we talk? We don't mean you any harm.”\n\nThe cries morphed into words, the voice childish in pitch, but monstrous in tone, as if dark fingers were manipulating the vocal cords like a harp. “*This is **my** home!*”\n\nIf I'd known we were walking into a Redjacket's claimed dwelling, I would’ve brought an offering. But now that I knew that it was here, it was easy to see why this listing had been up for so long, and why rent was so cheap in relation to the nice neighborhood it was placed in. This Redjacket must've scared off other potential renters. \n\nI told the Redjacket, “We'll be back with a proper offering.”\n\nIt grumbled, but didn't protest. Its cries had stopped, for the time being. That was a good sign. That meant it was open to communicating, albeit begrudgingly. As long as we handled the infestation properly, we could be out of the apartment by the end of the month. \n\nUpon discussion with Deirdre and Reyna, the latter was understandably unnerved by the idea of living with a Redjacket. We made sure to have this talk outside where the house's atypical resident couldn’t eavesdrop and potentially take offense. Meanwhile, the landlord paced nervously nearby, eyes and nose red from rubbing at his face. \n\nWe'd gotten him to agree to cut rent in half if we took the property, given that he'd initially failed to disclose the Redjacket in the basement. Some may wonder why we chose to rent a property managed by someone who'd potentially put us in danger with his secrecy. The short answer is desperation. Yinz already know the reasons why we're anxious to leave the apartment; the sooner we get out of Gwythyr's property, the better. And anyone who has looked at housing costs lately can tell you that a place to live with good space in a nice neighborhood has become an anomaly in recent years. \n\nBesides, I figure it would only be a matter of time before we were called out to deal with this infestation anyways. May as well mitigate it now before the landlord tries to mislead someone else. Someone that wouldn't know how to deal with it properly and would endanger themselves and anyone else living under their roof. \n\n“How do they compare to Housekeepers?” Reyna whispered, watching the house's front door as if expecting the Redjacket to burst through it at any moment. \n\n“Redjackets, generally, are more stable than Housekeepers,” I explained. “We wouldn't have to worry about it transforming. As long as we feed it in the same place every night and treat it with dignity, it'll be like having a fourth roommate that really likes to clean.”\n\nDeirdre supplied, “They also bring good luck to a household. We certainly could use more of that. It's also got a nice yard, and it's close enough that I could walk to the office.”\n\nReyna nodded, but still looked rightfully concerned as she asked, “Are they pet friendly?” \n\nI hesitated. Ordinarily, Redjackets are good with common house pets such as dogs and cats, but one of the many chores that they're said to help out with is removing pests from homes. Depending on its opinion on skunks, it could see Fireball as an intruder. \n\n“That's a good question,” I replied. “We'll have to ask about that when we return.”\n\nWe made a quick run to get what we needed, then once the offering was acquired, we were back inside. Like previously, the Redjacket had begun to wail as I approached the basement door. I went first, leaving Deirdre and Reyna to wait at the top of the steps as I pressed on with a plastic bowl full of cream with a slice of Amish friendship bread floating in it. That may sound like an odd combination, but this is a delicacy to Redjackets. And nobody with any sense of taste can say ‘no’ to friendship bread. \n\n“We don't want to remove you from your home,” I assured it. “You were here before us and we intend to respect that.”\n\n*CLANG!* I flinched as something pounded on the side of the furnace. There were footsteps on the wooden stairs as Deirdre raced down to check on me, but the Redjacket’s enraged shriek stopped her in her tracks.\n\n“I'm alright!” I told her. “Just give us a minute.”\n\nFrom the little bit of her that I could see, that appeared to be the last thing that she wanted to do, but she didn't descend the stairs further. \n\nThere was a shadow in the corner. Roughly a foot tall in height. It was only marginally less dark than its surroundings. Humanoid in silhouette. \n\nWhen the Redjacket spoke, a slight German accent was noticeable now that it had stopped screaming. “If all three of you can look upon me without fainting, you will be fit to live under this roof.”\n\nWhile nobody is certain how Housekeepers are made – assuming that they are made at all – the cause of a Redjacket's appearance is well-documented and tragic: if an unbaptized child has been murdered, there is the possibility that it may return as a guardian of its former home. Or as an avenger, if the murderer was somebody who lives under the same roof. My stomach dropped as my mind painted a macabre picture of what could've happened to the poor thing.\n\nNevertheless, I embraced the cold tendrils of dread as I told the Redjacket, “I accept.”\n\nThe shadows receded as the house's guardian crept forward, its small hands reaching up to adjust the crimson mantle that they're known for. Some have also been spotted wearing pointed caps, though this one didn't seem to be privy to such a fashion statement. Once it stepped into the spot of light provided from the open door upstairs, it revealed a face that was both young and old. The round, cherubic cheeks of a child were covered by neat white whiskers. \n\nSlowly, it removed its jacket, revealing a knife sticking out of its small chest. Deep gouges dented its torso as if whoever had done this had intended to puncture every organ in the Redjacket’s small body. Rather than being afraid, like I was expected to be, I teared up. Rather, I just felt sickened. Saddened. \n\n*Who could do this? Especially to a child?*\n\nThere was a gasp from behind me. It sounded like Reyna. \n\nOnce it was satisfied that none of us were going to lose consciousness, the Redjacket put its mantle back over its thin shoulders, its small face grim. All of us had been shaken up in our own ways. Deirdre had needed to sit down on the stairs, her face buried in her hands as she sniffed.  Reyna kept her eyes low, wiping her own tears away, not wanting to look directly at the Redjacket. \n\n“I welcome you,” it said with a polite bow before retreating back into shadow. \n\n“Pardon me,” I interjected before it disappeared. “I just have a question.”\n\nIt paused, not turning back to face me. “What is it?”\n\n“We have a skunk. She doesn't spray, but she can be a bit feisty. Is that alright with you?”\n\nIt repeated, “Skunk?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nAnother pause. Then, “Does the skunk bite or piss on the floor?”\n\n“No.” Reyna answered for me this time. “She just has a slight attitude problem and stomps a lot.”\n\nThe Redjacket deliberated upon this, absentmindedly toying with something I couldn't see. \n\nBefore it completed its disappearing act, it informed us, “The skunk is welcome as well.”\n\nWe move in once my lease is up at the end of April. \n\nI know how it probably looks to some of yinz: a self-inflicted horror story waiting to happen. However, unlike the worst of our clientele, the three of us can handle the apparently monumental responsibility of setting out nightly bread and cream to keep our house's guardian happy. And on a more compassionate note, I think it would be good for the Redjacket to have a caring household. Clearly, it hadn't been shown enough of that in its prematurely shortened life. \n\nWith the housing situation figured out, that was one less thing to worry about. The next one on the list was the biggest: Gwythyr. Like I had alluded to four score and seven tangents ago, a discussion with the Wild Hunt needed to be had. \n\nSpeaking of, when Reyna told me about her agreement with the banjo bastard, I'd been ready to cut him to ribbons, hand or no hand. However, once I'd stopped seeing red, I thought about it. *Really* thought about it. \n\nAs much as I hate to say it, I know him. Far better than I ever wanted to. The fact that he's given her a decade is generous, and he does not afford generosity to many people. Something that she'd done had appealed to him; whether that was the way she handled getting the spear or how she volunteered to take on my debt, I'm not sure. Maybe all of the above. It's possible that this was an act of mercy on his part, but most likely, he wants to see if any of her impressive actions were a fluke or if they were truly representative of her character. \n\nIn short, this decade is a test. One that I know Reyna will pass. \n\nDon't get me wrong, when she told me about all of this, I was still considering marching down to his shop to negotiate with him to try to take my debt back – at swordpoint, if I had to – but then Deirdre brought up a good point that stopped me in my tracks. \n\n“Part of what impressed the Huntsman was her bravery,” Deirdre said quickly, holding the top of my arm gently, but firmly. “Think of the implications. It wouldn't look good for her.”\n\nI hadn't even considered that he could interpret an attempt at renegotiation as me bailing Reyna out. That would be enough for him to convince himself that her entire sacrifice was just ‘lipservice,’ as he put it. In that event, his disdain for her would be even worse than ever, and yinz have seen how he treats humans that he doesn't respect. She'd be *lucky* to be turned into a crow, at that point. \n\n“Please, let me do this,” Reyna pleaded quietly. “Like, I'm scared, but… I have time. You know?”\n\nI'm scared for her, too. Believe me, I am. That being said, I have faith in her and I'll do what I can to help her every step of the way. \n\nAfter learning about the ten-year deal, it was hard for me to stomach the idea of seeing the mechanic again despite knowing that we needed him. It also didn’t help that our last conversation hadn’t exactly been pleasant, from what I remember while I was lying half-dead in the hospital. Likewise, I imagined that he most likely still harbored some ill-will towards me from my handling of the Wood Maiden situation, injury or not. \n\nThough, some of you have pointed out that I wasn’t in my right mind during that conversation, which yinz were right to. It’s possible that I may have misattributed his agitation as being against me. I don't know. I was there for the conversation, but not all there. Hell, I'd thought I dreamt that conversation between him and Reyna. \n\nIt seemed that the Houndmaster’s home was becoming a primary meeting spot between our two organizations. What’s interesting is that she doesn’t seem to mind hosting. I daresay that she might even enjoy it. Prior to the meeting, she told us that tea was offered to everyone on the grounds that Orion supplied scones to go with it. \n\nWhen we arrived, we found that our hostess had set out pretty, antique teacups for everyone as well as a tiered tray for the aforementioned scones. The kitchen table had been shined up like a new penny. Deirdre, being the avid tea-drinker, had aided in selecting the ones she thought would best suit the occasion.   \n\nShe had also been the first to try the tea, taking a sip before anyone could protest. Nothing happened, just as she’d known it wouldn’t. A trade was a trade, after all.\n\n“I already have two oversized juveniles to care for,” the Houndmaster said after surveying our reactions, earning side-eye from Iolo and a smirk from Deirdre as the Huntress poured herself some of the pink, floral-scented tea. “I have no desire to collect more.”     \n\n“We’re the light of your life and you know it,” Briar quipped with a smile, his chin propped on his hand as he watched the stragglers (Victor and I) take our seats, paying special attention to the boss.\n\nThe Houndmaster exhaled heavily into her cup, muttering, “If you say so…”\n\nVictor nodded at her with a look of long-suffering understanding as he took his place beside his thorn-wielding Not Boyfriend. The expression felt very targeted. Reyna and I exchanged a glance from where she sat across from me, staying close to Wes. \n\nTo summarize, this afternoon tea was much more relaxed than the last time all of us met up together last fall for the cookie hag. Of course, that interaction had been so tense that we could pretty much only go up from there. Strange to think that was only a few months ago. It feels like centuries have passed since then. \n\nThe mechanic was eyeing my left hand, though I couldn’t read his expression. Maybe this was a peculiar thought to have, but the last time we all had to work together, Iolo ended up losing a piece of himself. Now, I'm the one relying on parasitic seeds in order to function. \n\nUnder his scrutiny, I flexed the branches uncomfortably, finding that even the sensation of something as mundane as wood was overwhelming to the senses. It was raining again. Even with the aid of the growth lamp, I've noticed that the new joints tend to ache when it's humid. \n\nThe mechanic remarked, “You’ve been takin’ good care of it.” \n\n“Your advice helped,” I admitted, the closest I could get to thanking him without causing more trouble. \n\nThen with a slight smile, he informed me, “Rain fucks with mine, too.” \n\nHe could tell? \n\nVictor ended up being the one to get everyone on track, simply having to raise his voice a hair more than usual to turn the attention of the room towards him, “To start this off, it may help if one of the Hunters could describe what we're in for when it comes to Calan Mai.”\n\nIolo's gaze slid over to examine him, his grin suddenly appearing bitter. “Same shit that’s been happenin’ since centuries ago: Son of Scorcher and the White Son of Mist cross swords, Hunters and Sentinels die, and it all means nothin’. Won't mean shit til’ the final days. It's all just one pointless fuckin’ formality to keep Ol’ Pendragon happy.”\n\nAfterwards, the smile regained its familiar mischievous quality as he continued, leaning forward with renewed intensity. “But this year, we got somethin’ else in mind!”\n\nWes, who had been ordered to behave himself by the boss before we got there, appeared to be doing his best to refrain from diving across the table to wring Iolo's neck as he prodded, “And that is?”\n\nReyna tried to be subtle as she elbowed him in the ribs. She did not succeed. \n\nHowever, Iolo just chuckled. “Why, I'm *tickled* that you asked! We're gonna leave the fightin’ to the White Son of Mist and the others y'all got the pleasure of meetin’ on Halloween. Meanwhile, the three of us are gonna be hittin’ him where it *really* hurts. Know where that is, bloodsucker?”\n\n“Nope,” Wes said apathetically, not appearing to be interested in playing this guessing game.\n\n“All them human lawyers and chairmen we couldn't touch?” Iolo drummed on the table with his fingers for emphasis, still wearing a grin that came straight from Hell. “For one day, it's open season.” \n\n“What do you intend to do to them?” Deirdre inquired, brows drawn together in concern. \n\nThe mechanic glanced at her as if he'd forgotten she was there and was unpleasantly surprised to find her in the same room as him. \n\nBut his tone was cordial as he replied, “Ever since them blackpoll warblers were spotted, y'all may have noticed that construction has come to a grindin’ halt.  So that got me thinkin’ that maybe these esteemed assholes could help us replenish their populations *permanently.*  Along with a few other species that we just ain't seein’ enough of anymore.”\n\nThe Houndmaster agreed coldly. “Companies like theirs are the reason why those animals are disappearing to begin with. Only seems right that they should fix the problem they started.”\n\nThis may sound terrible, but I was past the point of caring what happened to the people working under Gwythyr. They didn't give a damn when people in town were vocal about not wanting them there. They also didn't give a rat’s ass when their expansions caused a food shortage in our county. As long as more zeroes got added to the ends of their paychecks, they didn't care what happened to any of us. \n\nAnd look at what happened to Reyna and me. I doubt we’re the only ones Gwythyr had lured into his home and introduced to his ‘Sentinels,’ as Iolo referred to them. We’re just the ones that got out.\n\nOn that note, I forgot to mention that Victor checked up on the Department of Wildlife a few days before this meeting. The officers that had played a role in the warbler case have been getting antagonized as well. They’ve reported being followed with one officer actually having someone break into his house while his daughter was home alone. Luckily, she’d been able to hide in the attic before the intruder could locate her. When law enforcement investigated, they found that nothing was taken. This information was shared in our talks with the Wild Hunt. \n\nI’d known that things with this development company were going to get ugly. I just never anticipated that it would be like this.\n\n“What do you need from us?” Victor asked.\n\nThe mechanic told him, “As of right now, nothin’. But on that day, you and your buddies at the Department of WIldlife are gonna wanna watch your backs. That’s what the spear’s for. We ain’t gonna be able to do much for ya, so y’all are just gonna have to survive the night on your own.”\n\nHe inclined his head at the spear, sitting with its tip submerged into a bucket of water. Had it always been there? Just chilling? Of course, you’d have to have a death wish in order to steal from a Hunter. \n\nNow that I’ve seen the fabled weapon myself, I have no idea how Reyna managed to carry that thing; it’s nearly twice her height and appeared to be made of sturdy, intricately carved wood. Whoever had crafted it had artfully adorned it with pointed leaves and Gaelic characters that Deirdre later explained were blessings intended to give the spear its power. \n\nIt was a lovely weapon. One that would be fit for a god to wield. Provided, of course, that it didn’t burn said god that armed themselves with it alive. \n\n“Is that Gae Assail? Lugh’s spear?” I inquired.\n\nIolo looked impressed. “Someone’s been doin’ her homework!”\n\nThat was a ‘yes.’ And not a comforting one. “How are we going to keep that thing from burning one of us up if we try to use it?”\n\nThe mechanic’s grin wasn’t kind. “Just keep it covered in blood and it shouldn't be a problem!”\n\n*Spoken like a true psychopath.*\n\nWes, to nobody’s surprise, volunteered. “Seems like fun.”\n\nIolo winked at him as he mockingly praised, “Knew I could count on you!”\n\n“Aren’t they going to be anticipating this?” Wes pointed out, for once having the self-control to not take Iolo’s bait. “I doubt they’re going to leave all these key people unprotected.”\n\nBriar gave the vampire a sneer. “You act like we aren’t experts at getting around things intended to keep us out. Or finding people that don’t want to be found. You had – what, three hagstones? – and we still got to you pretty easily.”\n\nBefore things could escalate, Victor curtly reprimanded the Hunter. “Be nice.” Then he glared at Wes. “You too.”\n\nWes raised his hand in a show of discombobulation. “Why am I getting yelled at?”\n\n“You know why,” Victor snapped, then continued like an exhausted parent. “Now, we’re going to discuss this like adults and there will be *no* infighting. Understood?” \n\nThe Houndmaster raised her teacup in silent acknowledgment. \n\nMeanwhile, Briar appeared to be biting back a smile as he rested an arm on the back of Victor’s chair, but didn’t say anything more. He merely stared down the vampire as if trying to pry open his skull with his mind. Wes, thankfully, didn’t feed into it.\n\nHowever, Iolo shrugged one shoulder. “Really ain’t much more to discuss. Just don’t die. Y’all are annoyingly good at that.”\n\nSo that's our great plan: don't die. Excellent. We'll see how that goes for [us.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/atypicalpests\/s\/SO6b77lmMD) \n \n\n"},"28":{"title":"The Final Observation","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kaxlko\/the_final_observation\/","flair":null,"author":"TheRambunctiousLord","selftext":"You don't realise the fragility of reality until you watch it begin to crack.\n\nI'm typing this now, hands shaking, because I've just understood something horrifying, and there won’t be much time to keep this coherent. I can't tell you exactly where I am—the truth is I'm not sure anymore—but what I can say is we are contracted by top-tier government research agencies. That is how I got here. It was here that Microsoft's Majorana 1 quantum chip was first tested and deployed, long before the public announcement.\n\nUsing Majorana fermions—particles that are their own antiparticles—this chip delivered computational power beyond our wildest imagination. Little does the world know, we've been using this technology covertly for years, enabling breakthroughs so profound they border on science fiction. We've accurately predicted geopolitical upheavals, controlled complex biological systems, and even manipulated climate patterns at a global scale. It's how Bill Gates got the idea to fund The Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment—beginning the controversial sun-dimming project to combat climate change.\n\nBut ambition, unchecked, can be catastrophic.\n\nHours ago, we reached an unprecedented milestone: simulating the quantum vacuum itself, the underlying quantum foam from which universes bubble into existence. For one fleeting moment, we glimpsed something extraordinary—but then something went horribly wrong.\n\nImmediately, subtle anomalies began to emerge in our instrumentation, rapidly escalating. Logs fractured, commands initiated but never concluded, calculations partially completed then abruptly reversed, and bizarrely, instruments spontaneously activated entirely unrelated simulations we never configured or even conceived of running. Each of us rushed to debug and investigate at our respective stations.\n\nThen I started noticing things personally. Looking at the clocks around me, one reads 2:03, another 1:58, and a third 2:01, which should be impossible since all are synchronized precisely with our atomic clock. My typing stutters inexplicably—letters appear, vanish, and then reappear completed without my conscious input. Soon, the entire team experiences surreal anomalies: receiving answers to questions we never asked, conversation amnesia, and the disorienting sensation of hearing the conclusion of a sentence before its beginning—all accompanied by an overwhelming and persistent sense of déjà vu.\n\nInvestigation became impossible as our calibration references began exhibiting quantum instability, shifting unpredictably between subtly different states. Even the clothes on my back feel inexplicably lighter, almost unreal, as if they lack the fundamental properties of solid matter. Doubting my perception, I witness my colleague’s jumper shift colour from red to blue between glances, though my memory insists it was originally red. Familiar items, like my notebook, feel profoundly alien, as if the emotional attachment and familiarity I once had have been erased.\n\nPanicking, I moved to leave the lab and raise the alarm. Our lab was meticulously designed, situated deep underground in a vibration-dampened, climate-controlled bunker. The Majorana 1 quantum chip itself is housed within a triple-shielded dilution refrigerator operating at temperatures colder than deep space, enclosed in a superconducting, electromagnetically shielded Faraday cage. Yet, as I opened the secure containment door, the auditory chaos engulfed me first. Background sounds fractured into nauseatingly dissonant layers, as i gazed out, voices echoed slightly ahead of mouths moving, and phantom whispers and footsteps emanated from empty spaces.\n\nReading became nearly impossible; labels shifted meanings without visual change—\"Cryogenic Tank 03\" became \"Emergency Vent 03\" upon a second glance, my mind reinterpreting the text entirely. Perception itself seemed layered. Briefly, I observed transparent echoes of alternate realities superimposed over my surroundings—two slightly different wall tiles at conflicting angles, a colleague flickering rapidly between locations.\n\nI quickly sealed the door, activating the Faraday cage’s electromagnetic shielding automatically behind me, isolating our lab in an attempt to slow the collapse, but it was futile. My mind races, comprehending this terrible truth: Our universe isn't stable; it's merely a fragile quantum probability among infinite possibilities. The Majorana 1 didn’t merely simulate—it observed, collapsing our delicate bubble universe into a catastrophic state.\n\nNow reality itself is beginning to unravel…and it will not be pleasant.\n\nEven here in this sealed room, emotionally everything feels profoundly wrong. An ordinary mug evokes dread, a chair sparks inexplicable grief. Familiar faces become momentarily strange or overwhelmingly familiar, evoking memories of lifetimes never lived. We are losing ourselves, and soon we will never again comprehend who, what, where, or even when we are—if we continue to exist at all.\n\nThese effects will escalate rapidly. Soon, you too will notice small shifts—forgotten conversations resurfacing with unfamiliar details, memories you trust suddenly seeming uncertain, moments repeating subtly differently, objects feeling unfamiliar in your hand. Your perception will split, witnessing ghostly layers of alternate possibilities, shadows whispering truths you never knew.\n\nSoon, our universe will fragment entirely, dissolving into raw quantum chaos. Seconds, minutes, days, weeks? Only time will tell. Hell maybe you're not out there anymore. Maybe I'm not actually here anymore either.\n\nI'm not writing this to stop it—we can't. It's far too late. I'm writing because, as the world flickers around me, I see something even more terrifying. I opened the logs from a spontaneous simulation—one that appeared unprompted after the observation.\n\nThis isn’t the first bubble universe to collapse—and it won’t be the last. Since the observation, the system has generated over 2¹⁶ logs. Each one shows signs of a universe-scale simulation attempt—spontaneous, unprompted, and beyond anything the test team configured.\n\nIf each log marks a reality, then we’ve unknowingly created 65,536 universes. Or perhaps... uncovered them. At least, among the ones I’ve been able to decode.\n\nBut the thought that lingers—the one that bends reason—isn’t just that this is happening.\n\nIt’s that every simulation might be another ‘us’ reaching the same conclusion.\n\nThe real question isn’t whether we’re the first to realise it.\n\nIt’s whether we’re just another entry in the next log."},"29":{"title":"It’s Digging Beneath my Bedroom","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kacf6m\/its_digging_beneath_my_bedroom\/","flair":null,"author":"Hokons","selftext":"My Dad never let me own a phone. He’d already lost one son to an online predator, and he wasn’t going to let it happen again.\n\nI tried to explain that I wasn’t like Kyle—I didn’t want to meet up with anyone from the internet. All I wanted was to message my friends and watch YouTube videos on the bus. But Dad wouldn’t have it.\n\nSince Kyle disappeared, I barely left my room. When dinner was ready, I waited until Dad had finished eating before I grabbed my plate—easier that way, without him watching. If I ate too slowly, he’d snap, *“What? Not good enough for you?”*\n\nBefore, Kyle used to redirect our old man’s anger at himself, shielding me from the worst of it. He’d taken a beating once when I knocked over a can of red paint in the garage; whenever someone asked about the purple bruise under his eye, he’d say it came from playing hockey. I never got the chance to thank him for that.\n\nI worked part-time bagging groceries at the Quick-Mart and saved two hundred dollars. One of my friends, Devon, sold me a cheap Motorola smartphone. I added people’s socials, installed YouTube, Spotify, and a few other apps, and set up this Reddit profile.\n\nI couldn’t risk Dad finding out the phone, so I pried up a floorboard in our bedroom—my bedroom—to hide it. I had to keep reminding myself of that. Without Kyle, there was no more “our” room, “our” desk, or “our” wardrobe: it was all mine, and that’s all it would ever be.\n\nWith steady internet access, my morbid curiosity got the better of me and I googled Kyle’s name. Articles—recent articles popped up, and a headline on an obscure news site froze me:\n\n**FATHER INVESTIGATED IN MISSING CHILD’S CASE**\n\nThe photo showed Dad stepping in—or out—of his Lexus.\n\nSuddenly, his boots echoed on the staircase. I slid the phone back under the floorboards and hopped into bed, pulling the cover to my chin.\n\nDad leaned in my doorway, slurring. “G-night, Bailey.”\n\nLately, I’d caught him hiding a flask of whiskey in his jacket. It hadn’t been this bad since the early months of the divorce.\n\n“Good night, Dad,” I replied, but a question escaped me. “Is… is there any new information on Kyle?”\n\nHis expression sobered. “You know the rule. We don’t talk about him. It’s not for you to worry about.”\n\nWhen he left, he kept the door ajar. I considered closing it, but if he went to the bathroom during the night and found it shut, he’d chew me out. \n\nI rolled onto my side and tried to sleep. I was beginning to drift off—my thoughts bleeding into hazy dreams—when the sound started.\n\n*scrtch, scrtch, scrtch.*\n\nIt reminded me of nails on skin or a shovel in dirt. I looked down at the floorboard I’d hidden the phone under, and the scratching stopped, as if it were saying, Yes, it’s me. I’m here. Had I left Spotify playing by mistake?\n\nCarefully, I slipped from the bed and crouched by the floor, glancing at the door to be sure Dad wasn’t watching. I pressed my ear to the boards and listened.\n\n*scrtch, scrtch, scrtch.*\n\nThen I recognized the sound: fingers clawing through soil, as if something was climbing up from beneath the house. I jumped back into bed and closed my eyes, desperately trying to ignore the sound. It was an absurd thought. Not one a rational mind interprets. Yet I couldn’t bring myself to lift the floorboard and look inside.\n\nThe next morning, I asked Dad what it could be. He had an immediate answer—rats. They’d probably nested in the walls and floor. One must have fallen into a gap and trapped itself.\n\nNight after night, the scraping continued. I wondered how long a rat could survive—five days? A week? By the end of two weeks, I knew it couldn’t be a rat. The sounds grew louder, closer. At times, when there was no wind outside, I’d hear weak, whistling breaths creeping up from the floorboard.\n\nI forced myself to endure it for two more days, determined to block out the noises until they faded—until last night, when everything changed.\n\nThe scratching began as usual around two or three in the morning, but after a few hours it stopped. Silence stretched, and for a peaceful moment I thought it may have stopped. But then the scraping resumed, rougher: fingernails against wood.\n\nThe loose floorboard wobbled open as something shifted beneath. Too terrified to look, I grabbed a stack of textbooks and placed them onto the board. The wobbling ceased, but on the other side the scratching continued.\n\nI stayed awake until dawn and at first light, I finally removed the textbooks and lifted the floorboard. Inside—my phone was gone—fallen into what had replaced it: an arm-sized hole leading into blackness. My heart pounded as I stared down the void.Without my phone, I had no light to shine inside and see how deep it was, so instead I leaned closer and hovered my ear over the hole.\n\nBreathing. The weak, whistling breaths I heard earlier—like the lungs were filled with dirt.\n\nMy pulse quickened. \n\nIt couldn’t be true—it’d be ridiculous to even consider it, but I found myself confronting the possibility.\n\nSomething was buried down there.\n\nAt school the next day, I borrowed Devon’s phone and called my number.\n\nDevon gave a short laugh. “You think the thing in the hole knows how to use a phone?”\n\nThe phone rang seven times, then clicked as someone answered.\n\n“Hello?” I whispered.\n\nA voice I knew all too well—Kyle’s voice—crackled through the static:\n\n“Don’t trust him.”"},"30":{"title":"If you're reading this, it's already too late.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kantei\/if_youre_reading_this_its_already_too_late\/","flair":null,"author":"xitopnotch","selftext":"\n\nI wish I could say I took the job at the old Briarwood Asylum because I was brave, or curious, or even desperate for a thrill. The truth is, I needed the money. I’d been laid off from my last gig, rent was overdue, and the ad for a nightwatch position at the edge of town promised more than I’d made in months. The only catch was the location: Briarwood, a sprawling ruin of red brick and broken windows, long since abandoned by the state and left to rot at the edge of the woods.\n\nIt was the kind of place people crossed the street to avoid, even in daylight. The kind of place that made the local news every few years, usually after some daring high schooler tried to spend the night and came running out at dawn, pale and shivering, refusing to talk about what they’d seen. But the pay was good, and the ad said “no experience necessary.” I figured I’d be sitting in a booth, maybe walking the perimeter a few times, drinking coffee and scrolling my phone until sunrise. Easy money, or so I thought.\n\nThe night before my first shift, I did what any sane person would do: I Googled it. “Briarwood Asylum nightwatch.” The results were mostly urban legends, grainy YouTube explorations, and a handful of Reddit threads with titles like “Never work security at Briarwood” and “Rules for surviving the asylum.” I read them all, half-laughing at the melodrama, half-wishing I hadn’t.\n\nThe rules were always vague, like warnings passed around a campfire. “Don’t go inside after dark,” one post insisted, though nobody explained why. “If you hear music, cover your ears.” “Never answer if someone calls your name.” “Don’t look at the windows from the inside.” There were more, but they all blurred together-half superstition, half dare. I copied them into a note on my phone, just in case. It felt silly, but I’d always been a little superstitious, and I figured it couldn’t hurt.\n\nI packed a bag with the essentials: flashlight, thermos, a couple of sandwiches, and a paperback I’d already read twice. I left my lucky coin at home, thinking it was better not to bring anything personal to a place like this. The last thing I did before leaving was text my sister: “Starting new job tonight. If you don’t hear from me by noon, call the cops.” She sent back a string of laughing emojis, but I noticed she didn’t say “good luck.”\n\nThe drive out to Briarwood took longer than I expected. The road wound through thick woods, the trees pressing close on either side, branches scraping the roof of my car. I kept the radio low, the DJ’s voice a thin thread against the growing dark. By the time I saw the asylum’s gates looming out of the mist, my hands were slick on the wheel.\n\nThe building itself was worse than the photos. Three stories of crumbling brick, windows boarded up or smashed out, the front steps sagging under their own weight. Weeds choked the driveway, and the old iron gates hung open, one twisted off its hinges. I parked beside a battered security shack just inside the fence, the only structure that looked like it might still have working electricity.\n\nThe air was thick with the smell of rain and mildew. I slung my bag over my shoulder and made my way to the shack, the gravel crunching under my boots. The door creaked open with a reluctant groan, and I stepped inside, blinking as my eyes adjusted to the dim light.\n\nThe interior was cramped but tidy-a battered desk, a folding chair, a bank of ancient monitors showing grainy feeds from cameras mounted around the perimeter. Someone had left a half-empty mug of coffee on the desk, the surface scummed over with mold. I wrinkled my nose and set my bag down, taking stock.\n\nThere was a logbook on the desk, the cover worn smooth by years of nervous hands. I flipped it open, scanning the last few entries. Most were short and businesslike-“All clear, 2:00 AM,” “Patrol complete, 4:00 AM”-but the handwriting changed near the end, growing shaky and cramped. The last entry was dated three days ago. It just said, “Heard music again. Staying in the shack tonight.” No signature.\n\nI felt a chill crawl up my spine. I checked the rest of the shack, looking for any sign of the last nightwatch, but found nothing except a battered thermos in the trash and a faded jacket hanging on a hook. I wondered if he’d quit, or if he’d just stopped coming in. Maybe he’d found a better job. Maybe he’d listened to the warnings.\n\nI settled into the chair and powered up the monitors, watching as the cameras flickered to life. The feeds were mostly static, but I could make out the main gates, the overgrown courtyard, and the front steps of the asylum. One camera showed the rear loading dock, the door hanging open on rusted hinges. Another showed the old playground, the swings creaking in the breeze. I tried not to imagine them moving on their own.\n\nI pulled out my phone and opened the note with the internet rules, reading them over one more time. “Don’t go inside after dark.” That one seemed easy enough. The shack was just outside the main building, and the job description hadn’t said anything about patrolling the interior. “If you hear music, cover your ears.” I wondered what kind of music they meant. “Never answer if someone calls your name.” That one made me uneasy, though I told myself it was just a prank. “Don’t look at the windows from the inside.” I wasn’t sure what that meant, but I resolved to keep my eyes on the monitors.\n\nThe first hour passed in silence. I made a round of the fence, flashlight beam bouncing off twisted metal and tangled weeds. The air was cold and still, the only sound the distant croak of frogs from the woods. I kept glancing back at the asylum, half-expecting to see a face in one of the broken windows, but there was nothing. Just darkness and the slow drip of rain from the eaves.\n\nI returned to the shack and poured myself a cup of coffee from my thermos, trying to ignore the way the shadows pooled in the corners. I flipped through the logbook again, reading older entries. Most were routine, but every so often there was a note that made my skin crawl. “Heard footsteps in the west hall. No one there.” “Lights on in Ward B. Reported to supervisor.” “Children laughing in the courtyard. No children on site.” I wondered if the same person had written them all, or if the fear just seeped in over time.\n\nIt was around midnight when I heard the first sound. It started as a faint melody, drifting through the rain-a few notes of a lullaby, played on an old piano. I froze, heart pounding, and remembered the rule: “If you hear music, cover your ears.” I pressed my hands over my ears, feeling ridiculous, but the music grew louder, winding through the night like smoke. I squeezed my eyes shut, counting to thirty. When I opened them, the music was gone.\n\nI let out a shaky breath and checked the monitors. Nothing had changed. The courtyard was empty, the gates still closed. I told myself it was just my imagination, the wind playing tricks. But I kept my hands close to my ears for the rest of the night, just in case.\n\nAt 2:00 AM, I heard my name. It was faint, almost lost in the hiss of rain on the roof, but unmistakable. “Eli.” My heart skipped. I hadn’t told anyone at the agency my name, and I was sure I hadn’t used it online. The voice was soft, almost pleading. “Eli, come here.” I gripped the edge of the desk, knuckles white, and remembered the rule: “Never answer if someone calls your name.” I stayed silent, staring at the monitors, willing the voice to stop. After a minute, it faded, leaving only the sound of my own ragged breathing.\n\nI spent the rest of the night on edge, jumping at every creak and groan from the old building. At one point, I caught myself staring at the asylum’s windows, trying to see inside. I looked away quickly, heart hammering, and focused on the monitors. The rules didn’t say what would happen if I broke them, but I wasn’t eager to find out.\n\nJust before dawn, I found something wedged behind the desk-a battered, spiral-bound notebook, the cover stained and torn. I flipped it open, squinting in the dim light. The handwriting was cramped and hurried, the ink smudged in places. The first page was dated almost a year ago. “First night at Briarwood. They say it’s just stories, but I’m not so sure.” I turned the page, reading on. The entries were short at first, then grew longer, more frantic. “Heard footsteps in the hall. Doors opening and closing. Saw something in Ward B. Not going back.”\n\nI closed the notebook, hands shaking. I’d planned to read more, but the sun was rising, and I wanted nothing more than to get in my car and drive home. As I locked the shack behind me, I glanced back at the asylum. The windows seemed to watch me, empty and waiting.\n\nI told myself it was just a job. Just a building. Just another night.\n\nBut as I drove away, the rules echoed in my mind, and I wondered what I’d gotten myself into.\n\nThe second night felt different from the start. I tried to tell myself it was just nerves, that I was still getting used to the routine, but the air around Briarwood was heavier, as if the mist had thickened and settled into my bones. I arrived just before dusk, headlights cutting through the gloom, and parked in the same spot beside the battered security shack. The asylum loomed in the rearview mirror, its windows black and blind, the brickwork slick with rain. I hesitated before getting out, watching the treeline for movement, but there was nothing out there except the slow creep of shadows.\n\nInside the shack, everything was as I’d left it. The monitors flickered with static, the logbook lay open on the desk, and my battered thermos waited for me like a small comfort. I set my bag down and checked the perimeter again, flashlight in hand, boots crunching over gravel and wet leaves. The fence was intact, the gates still chained, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was watching from the asylum’s upper floors. I kept my eyes down, following the path around the building, and made a point not to look at the windows.\n\nBy the time I finished my round, the sky was a deep bruised purple, and the first stars were blinking through the clouds. I ducked back into the shack, locking the door behind me, and poured a cup of coffee. My hands were steadier than the night before, but my mind kept drifting to the notebook I’d found wedged behind the desk. I pulled it out, smoothing the crumpled pages, and began to read.\n\nThe first few entries were almost mundane. The previous nightwatch-his name was Mark, according to the inside cover-described his first impressions of Briarwood, the endless paperwork, the boredom of long nights. He mentioned the rules in passing, noting how the agency had warned him to stay out of the main building after dark. “Probably just liability,” he wrote. “Don’t want anyone falling through the floorboards.” But as the entries went on, the tone shifted. The handwriting grew sloppier, the sentences shorter, as if he’d been writing in a hurry.\n\n“Lights on in Ward B again. No power to that part of the building. Heard someone humming in the hall. Didn’t check it out.”\n\n“Kids laughing in the courtyard. No kids here. Thought I saw someone by the swings. Gone when I looked again.”\n\n“Don’t go inside after midnight. That’s what the old guy said. He didn’t say why.”\n\nI shivered, glancing at the clock. It was only a little after nine, the night still young. I set the notebook aside and checked the monitors. The feeds were mostly useless, but every so often a shape would flicker across the screen-a branch swaying, a stray cat darting through the weeds, something too blurry to make out. I told myself it was just the low resolution, the camera’s sensors struggling with the dark.\n\nAround ten, I heard the music again. It was faint, barely more than a few notes drifting through the rain, but unmistakable. I froze, heart thudding, and pressed my hands over my ears. The melody twisted and warped, growing louder, closer, until it felt like it was playing inside my skull. I counted to thirty, then to sixty, and finally the music faded, leaving only the hiss of static from the monitors.\n\nI let out a shaky breath and tried to laugh it off, but it didn’t feel funny. I remembered the Reddit post-“If you hear music, cover your ears”-and wondered what would happen if I didn’t. I made a mental note to never find out.\n\nThe rest of the night passed slowly. I read more of Mark’s journal, the entries growing stranger as the days went on. He wrote about doors opening and closing on their own, cold spots that lingered in the halls, voices whispering from behind locked doors. “Sometimes I think I see someone watching from the third floor,” he wrote. “Tall, thin, always in the same window. When I blink, he’s gone.”\n\nThere was a gap in the journal-a few pages torn out, the edges ragged. The next entry was dated two weeks later. The handwriting was almost illegible.\n\n“Something’s wrong with the cameras. Keep showing the same loop. Saw myself walking the grounds, but I was in the shack. Don’t look at the windows. Don’t answer if they call your name. Don’t let them know you can see them.”\n\nI closed the notebook, rubbing my eyes. The shack felt colder, the air pressing in on all sides. I checked the monitors again, looking for anything out of place. The courtyard was empty, the gates still closed, but the camera facing the playground was dark, the feed cut off by static. I tapped the screen, but nothing happened.\n\nJust after midnight, I heard footsteps outside. Slow, deliberate, crunching over gravel. I killed the lights and pressed myself against the wall, listening as the steps circled the shack. The footsteps paused by the door, then continued around the building, fading into the distance. I waited a full five minutes before turning the lights back on, my heart pounding in my throat.\n\nI tried to convince myself it was just a stray animal, maybe a deer or a fox, but the steps had sounded too heavy, too purposeful. I checked the monitors, but all I saw was the empty yard, the broken swings creaking in the wind.\n\nI went back to the journal, searching for anything that might explain what was happening. Mark’s entries grew more frantic, the lines barely legible. “Don’t go near Ward B. Don’t even look at the door. Heard something scratching from inside. Smells like smoke.”\n\n“Lights on in the west hall. No power. Saw someone moving inside. Not going in.”\n\n“Dreamed I was inside. Couldn’t find my way out. Woke up with mud on my boots.”\n\nI looked down at my own boots, clean and dry, and shivered. I wondered if Mark had gone inside, if he’d broken one of the rules without realizing it. I wondered what had happened to him.\n\nThe hours dragged by. I made another round of the fence, flashlight beam darting over the tangled weeds. The air was colder now, the mist thick enough to cling to my skin. I kept my eyes down, refusing to look at the asylum’s windows. I thought I heard laughter, high and thin, drifting from the playground, but when I turned my light that way, the swings were empty.\n\nBack in the shack, I poured another cup of coffee and tried to steady my nerves. I flipped through the logbook, looking for any mention of Mark, but there was nothing after that last shaky entry. I wondered if he’d quit, or if something worse had happened. I wondered if anyone would come looking for me if I disappeared.\n\nSometime after three, the monitors flickered, the feeds cutting in and out. For a moment, I thought I saw someone standing by the front steps-a tall figure, unmoving, face lost in shadow. I blinked, and the screen went dark. When the feed returned, the steps were empty.\n\nI spent the rest of the night reading and rereading Mark’s journal, searching for patterns in his fear. The rules he’d written were different from the ones I’d found online-stranger, more desperate. “Don’t let them know you can see them.” “Don’t go near Ward B.” “Don’t look at the windows.” I wondered how many rules there really were, and how many I’d already broken without knowing.\n\nDawn came slow and gray, the sky barely lighter than the night. I locked up the shack and walked to my car, glancing back at the asylum one last time. The windows were empty, but I felt their gaze on my back all the way to the road.\n\nAt home, I tried to sleep, but my dreams were filled with music and laughter, footsteps echoing down endless halls. I woke with the taste of mud in my mouth and the feeling that I’d forgotten something important.\n\nI told myself it was just a job. Just another night.\n\nBut as I drifted off again, Mark’s words echoed in my mind, and I wondered what I’d do if the rules stopped working.  \n\n\nI didn’t want to go back for the third night. I lay in bed long after my alarm went off, staring at the ceiling, trying to convince myself that I was being ridiculous. It was just a job. Just a building. Just another night. But the memory of Mark’s frantic handwriting, the echo of music in my dreams, and the way my name had floated through the rain like a secret made my skin crawl. I told myself I needed the money. I told myself I was stronger than a few ghost stories. I got dressed, packed my bag, and drove to Briarwood with my jaw clenched tight and my hands shaking on the wheel.\n\nThe asylum looked different in the fog. The mist rolled thick over the grounds, swallowing the fence and softening the jagged lines of the building. The windows were dark, but I could have sworn I saw movement behind the glass as I pulled up. I parked by the shack, engine idling, and sat for a long moment, listening to the tick of the cooling metal. I thought about calling the agency and quitting. I thought about driving away and never looking back. But I got out, locked the car, and stepped into the gloom.\n\nInside the shack, the air was stale and cold. The monitors flickered with static, the logbook lay open to a blank page, and Mark’s journal waited for me on the desk. I set my bag down and checked the perimeter, flashlight beam slicing through the fog. The fence was intact, the gates chained, but the air felt charged, as if the whole world was holding its breath.\n\nI made my way around the building, boots squelching in the wet grass. The mist muffled every sound, turning my footsteps into dull thuds. I kept my eyes down, refusing to look at the windows, but I felt them watching, cold and patient. When I passed the playground, the swings creaked, though there was no wind. I hurried back to the shack, heart pounding, and locked the door behind me.\n\nI poured myself a cup of coffee and sat at the desk, staring at the monitors. The feeds were worse than ever, lines of static crawling across the screens. I tapped the camera showing the front steps, trying to clear the picture, but the image only smeared, as if something was pressing against the lens from the inside.\n\nI opened Mark’s journal, flipping to the last entry I’d read. The handwriting was jagged, the words running together. “Don’t let them know you can see them. Don’t answer the phones. Don’t go inside, not even for a second.” I frowned, remembering my first night, when I’d stepped into the entryway to check the fuse box after the shack’s lights had flickered. I hadn’t thought anything of it at the time. The rules I’d found online hadn’t said anything about the threshold. But Mark’s words made my stomach twist.\n\nI turned the page. The next entry was shorter, almost a scrawl. “Something’s wrong with the clocks. Time doesn’t move right in there. Saw myself in the hall, but I was outside. If you’re reading this, you’ve already broken the rules.”\n\nI sat back, the shack suddenly too small, too close. I tried to remember exactly how long I’d been inside the asylum that first night. Five minutes? Less? I told myself it didn’t matter, but the words in the journal said otherwise.\n\nThe monitors flickered. For a moment, every screen went black. Then, one by one, they snapped back to life. The camera facing the rear loading dock showed a figure standing in the doorway, tall and thin, face lost in shadow. I leaned forward, heart racing, but the image blurred and dissolved before I could make out any details.\n\nI tried to focus on the routine. I checked the logbook, made notes about the weather, the state of the fence, the time I started my patrol. I read through the rules on my phone again, the vague warnings from strangers online. “Don’t go inside after dark. If you hear music, cover your ears. Never answer if someone calls your name. Don’t look at the windows from the inside.” I wondered how many rules there really were, and how many I’d missed.\n\nJust after midnight, the shack phone rang. The sound was shrill, slicing through the silence. I stared at it, pulse thudding in my ears. The agency had never called before. I let it ring, counting the seconds, but it didn’t stop. After the tenth ring, I yanked the cord from the wall. The ringing continued, echoing faintly from somewhere deeper in the building. I pressed my hands to my ears, but the sound wormed its way through the walls, vibrating in my bones. I remembered Mark’s warning: “Don’t answer the phones.” I squeezed my eyes shut, willing the sound to stop. Eventually, it faded, leaving only the hiss of static from the monitors.\n\nI opened the journal again, searching for answers. The next entry was barely legible, the ink smeared and frantic. “They know I went inside. I see them everywhere now. In the windows, in the halls. They call my name, but it’s not my voice. If you see yourself, don’t follow.”\n\nI shivered, thinking of the figure on the monitor, the way it had seemed to watch me. I wondered if Mark had seen himself, if he’d followed, if that was why he’d disappeared.\n\nThe shack felt colder, the air thick and wet. I wrapped my jacket tighter and tried to focus on the routine. I made another round of the fence, flashlight beam darting over the grass. The mist was thicker now, swirling around my legs. I kept my eyes down, refusing to look at the asylum. When I passed the playground, I heard laughter, high and thin, drifting through the fog. I froze, heart pounding, and remembered the rule: “If you hear children laughing, turn off your flashlight until it stops.” I clicked off the beam, standing in darkness, breath held tight in my chest. The laughter grew louder, echoing from all directions, then faded as suddenly as it had begun. I turned the flashlight back on and hurried back to the shack.\n\nInside, the monitors flickered again. The camera facing the main entrance showed a door swinging open, though I knew it was chained shut. The feed glitched, and for a moment, I saw a figure standing just inside the doorway, face pressed to the glass. I blinked, and the screen went dark.\n\nI sat at the desk, staring at the journal. The next entry was the last. “If you’re reading this, it’s too late. You’ve already broken the rules. Don’t let them know you’re afraid. Don’t let them see you looking. Don’t let them hear your name. Don’t go inside. Don’t go inside. Don’t go inside.”\n\nI closed the notebook, hands shaking. I tried to remember exactly what I’d done that first night. I’d stepped over the threshold, just for a minute, to check the fuse box. I’d looked at the windows, trying to see inside. I’d heard my name and tried to ignore it, but I’d listened. I’d broken the rules, not knowing what they really were.\n\nThe shack phone rang again, the sound muffled and distant. I ignored it, staring at the monitors. The feeds flickered, showing empty halls, broken swings, the dark line of the fence. But in every frame, I saw movement at the edges-shadows slipping through doorways, faces pressed to the glass, hands reaching for the locks.\n\nI spent the rest of the night reading and rereading Mark’s journal, searching for something I’d missed. But the words blurred together, the warnings looping in my mind. Don’t go inside. Don’t let them hear your name. Don’t look at the windows. Don’t answer the phones.\n\nDawn came slow and gray, the sky barely lighter than the night. I locked up the shack and walked to my car, glancing back at the asylum one last time. The windows were empty, but I felt their gaze on my back all the way to the road.\n\nAt home, I tried to sleep, but my dreams were filled with laughter and music, footsteps echoing down endless halls. I woke with the taste of mud in my mouth and the feeling that I’d forgotten something important.\n\nI told myself it was just a job. Just another night.\n\nBut as I drifted off again, Mark’s words echoed in my mind, and I wondered what I’d do if the rules stopped working.\n\n<\/hr>\n\nBy the fourth night, I was running on nerves and caffeine. I barely slept during the day, haunted by dreams that felt more like memories-long, echoing corridors, music that twisted in and out of tune, laughter that turned to screams. I’d wake with my heart pounding, tangled in sweat-soaked sheets, the taste of rust and earth in my mouth. I started leaving the lights on, even at home, but the shadows always found a way to creep in.\n\nDriving to Briarwood felt like descending into a tunnel. The trees pressed close, branches scraping the roof, and the sky was a flat, unbroken gray. I parked in my usual spot, engine idling for a long moment before I forced myself out. The air was colder than it should have been for late spring, heavy with the smell of rain and something sour, like old milk. The asylum loomed out of the mist, windows black and watchful.\n\nInside the shack, I went through the motions-check the monitors, log the time, pour a cup of coffee-but my mind kept drifting to Mark’s journal. The last entry haunted me: If you’re reading this, it’s too late. You’ve already broken the rules. Don’t go inside. Don’t go inside. Don’t go inside. I’d tried to convince myself that stepping over the threshold that first night hadn’t mattered, that I hadn’t really entered the building, not the way Mark meant. But the more I read, the less certain I became.\n\nI flipped through the journal again, searching for anything I’d missed. There were pages I hadn’t noticed before, stuck together with old coffee stains. I pried them apart carefully, heart thudding. The handwriting was worse here, the lines jagged and uneven, as if Mark had been writing in the dark.\n\n“They watch from the windows. Sometimes I see myself watching back. The phone rings even when it’s unplugged. The music is getting louder. I think it’s coming from Ward B.”\n\nWard B. The name sent a chill through me. I’d seen it mentioned in the logbook, in Mark’s early entries, but I’d never seen it with my own eyes. The floor plan taped to the wall of the shack showed the main entrance, the admin wing, the old dormitories, and, tucked away at the back, Ward B. The door was supposed to be chained shut, but Mark’s warnings made me wonder.\n\nI checked the monitors, but the camera covering the back wing was dead, nothing but static. I tried to tell myself it was just a wiring issue, water in the lines, but the knot in my stomach tightened.\n\nI made my first round of the fence, moving quickly, eyes fixed on the ground. The mist was thicker than ever, swirling around my ankles, muffling the world. When I passed the playground, the swings were still, but I heard the faintest echo of laughter, high and thin, just at the edge of hearing. I kept walking, refusing to look back.\n\nBack in the shack, I poured another cup of coffee and stared at the monitors. The feeds flickered, showing empty halls, broken glass, and, for a moment, a shape moving in the admin wing-a tall figure, thin as a shadow, gliding past the windows. I blinked, and it was gone.\n\nI opened the journal again, flipping to the last few entries. Mark’s words were barely legible, written in a trembling hand. “I went inside. I had to. The music wouldn’t stop. It’s louder in Ward B. I think that’s where they are. I saw someone-looked like me, but not. Don’t follow. Don’t let them see you.”\n\nThe shack phone rang, shrill and insistent. I stared at it, refusing to move. The ringing grew louder, echoing in my skull, until I wanted to scream. I pressed my hands over my ears, but the sound wormed its way through, vibrating in my bones. I remembered Mark’s warning: Don’t answer the phones. I waited until the ringing stopped, breath coming in shallow gasps.\n\nI tried to focus on the routine. I checked the logbook, made another round of the fence, but the air felt wrong-charged, electric, as if a storm were about to break. When I passed the back of the building, I saw that the door to Ward B was ajar, the chain hanging loose. My flashlight flickered, the beam dancing over peeling paint and rusted hinges.\n\nI should have turned back. I should have locked myself in the shack and waited for dawn. But something pulled me forward-a need to know, to see for myself what had happened to Mark. I stepped up to the door, heart hammering, and peered inside.\n\nThe hallway beyond was dark, the air thick with dust and the faint, sour smell of rot. My footsteps echoed on cracked linoleum, each step louder than the last. The music was louder here, a twisted lullaby played on broken keys, echoing down the corridor. I pressed my hands over my ears, but the sound seeped through, wrapping around my thoughts.\n\nI followed the hallway, passing empty rooms, doors hanging open like broken mouths. The walls were covered in scratches, words carved deep into the plaster-HELP, DON’T LOOK, THEY’RE HERE. My flashlight flickered, the beam catching on something at the end of the hall.\n\nIt was a door, half open, light spilling out into the darkness. I crept closer, every instinct screaming at me to run. The music was deafening now, the notes twisting and warping, turning into voices that whispered my name.\n\nInside the room, I found Mark.\n\nHe was slumped against the far wall, knees drawn to his chest, eyes wide and staring. His mouth was open in a silent scream, lips cracked and bloody. His hands clutched a scrap of paper, the words smeared with sweat and tears. I knelt beside him, heart pounding, and pried the note from his grip.\n\nThe handwriting was barely legible, but I could make out the words: “They’re not patients anymore. Don’t let them see you. Don’t let them hear your name. Don’t go inside.”\n\nI staggered back, bile rising in my throat. The room was cold, colder than the rest of the building, and the shadows seemed to press in from all sides. I heard footsteps in the hallway, slow and deliberate, coming closer. I killed my flashlight, pressing myself against the wall, breath held tight in my chest.\n\nThe footsteps paused outside the door. I saw a shadow slip past the crack, tall and thin, moving with an unnatural grace. I squeezed my eyes shut, willing myself to disappear. The music faded, replaced by a low, guttural whisper. “Eli. Come here.”\n\nI bit my tongue, refusing to answer. The footsteps moved on, fading into the dark.\n\nWhen I opened my eyes, the room was empty. Mark’s body was still, the note clutched in his hand. I stumbled to my feet, heart racing, and fled down the hallway, the walls closing in on all sides. The music started again, louder than before, chasing me through the corridors.\n\nI burst out the door into the night, gasping for air. The mist was thicker now, swirling around my legs, hiding the world. I ran for the shack, slamming the door behind me, and collapsed in the chair, shaking.\n\nOn the desk, Mark’s journal lay open to a new page. The handwriting was mine.\n\n“Don’t go inside. Don’t let them see you. Don’t let them hear your name.”\n\nI stared at the words, heart pounding. I tried to remember writing them, but my mind was blank. The rules looped in my head, over and over, until they lost all meaning.\n\nThe monitors flickered, showing empty halls, broken swings, and, in every frame, a shadow moving at the edge of the light.\n\nI sat in the shack until dawn, afraid to move, afraid to breathe. When the sun finally rose, I locked the door behind me and walked to my car, glancing back at the asylum one last time. The windows were empty, but I felt their gaze on my back all the way to the road.\n\nAt home, I tried to sleep, but the music followed me, twisting through my dreams. I woke with the taste of dust in my mouth and the feeling that I’d left something behind.\n\nI told myself it was just a job. Just another night.\n\nBut as I drifted off again, Mark’s words echoed in my mind, and I wondered if I’d ever really left the building at all.\n\nI barely remember driving to Briarwood for my fifth shift. The world outside the car windows was little more than a blur of gray and green, the trees pressing in so close they seemed to swallow the road behind me. I hadn’t slept. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw Mark’s face, frozen in terror, and heard the music winding through empty corridors. I kept the radio off, needing the silence, but even then, I could hear faint laughter in the back of my mind, the echo of footsteps that never quite faded.\n\nWhen I pulled up to the asylum, the sky was a flat, colorless wash, neither night nor day. The building looked the same as always-three stories of crumbling brick, windows like rows of empty eyes. The security shack stood alone, a small island of false safety in a sea of weeds and broken glass. I sat in the car for a long time, hands gripping the wheel, trying to summon the will to get out. I told myself it was just a job. Just a building. Just another night.\n\nBut I knew that wasn’t true anymore.\n\nI forced myself out of the car, boots crunching on gravel, and made my way to the shack. The air was colder than it should have been, thick with the smell of rain and old, rotting leaves. I unlocked the door and stepped inside, locking it again behind me out of habit, though I knew it wouldn’t help. The monitors flickered with static, the logbook lay open to a blank page, and Mark’s journal sat in the center of the desk, waiting.\n\nI didn’t bother making coffee. I didn’t check the perimeter. I just sat down and stared at the monitors, watching the feeds cycle through empty halls, broken swings, the dark line of the fence. The camera covering Ward B was still dead, nothing but a gray smear. I tried not to think about what was waiting in that wing, about the cold, silent thing that wore Mark’s face.\n\nI picked up the journal, flipping through the pages, searching for something I’d missed. The warnings were all there, scrawled in a hand that grew more frantic with every entry: Don’t go inside. Don’t let them see you. Don’t let them hear your name. Don’t answer the phones. Don’t look at the windows. Don’t follow if you see yourself. But it was too late for me. I’d already broken the rules.\n\nI set the journal down and leaned back in the chair, closing my eyes. The shack felt smaller than ever, the air thick and heavy. I tried to remember what it had felt like to be safe, to believe that rules could protect me. But all I could hear was the music, winding through the halls, growing louder with every beat of my heart.\n\nThe phone rang.\n\nI stared at it, the sound sharp and insistent, cutting through the silence. I didn’t move. I’d learned my lesson. The ringing grew louder, echoing in my skull, until it seemed to fill the whole world. I pressed my hands over my ears, but the sound wormed its way in, vibrating in my bones.\n\nWhen it finally stopped, the silence was worse.\n\nI stood and walked to the window, careful not to look at the asylum. The mist had rolled in again, thick and swirling, hiding the world beyond the fence. I could see the faint outline of the playground, the swings barely moving, though there was no wind. I thought I saw a figure standing by the gate, tall and thin, but when I blinked, it was gone.\n\nI turned back to the desk and found the journal open to a new page. The handwriting was mine.\n\n“They’re not patients anymore. The rules don’t matter. If you’re reading this, you’re already inside.”\n\nI stared at the words, heart pounding. I didn’t remember writing them. I tried to close the journal, but my hands wouldn’t move. The shack felt colder, the shadows pressing in from all sides. I heard footsteps outside, slow and deliberate, crunching over gravel. I killed the lights and pressed myself against the wall, breath held tight in my chest.\n\nThe footsteps paused by the door. I heard a soft, familiar voice-my own-whispering from the other side. “Eli. Come here.”\n\nI squeezed my eyes shut, refusing to answer. The footsteps moved on, circling the shack, fading into the mist.\n\nI sat in the dark, listening to the silence, waiting for dawn. But the sky never changed. The world outside the window was stuck in that gray, endless twilight, the mist never lifting. The monitors flickered, showing empty halls, broken glass, and, in every frame, a shadow moving at the edge of the light.\n\nI tried to write in the logbook, but the pen wouldn’t work. The pages stayed blank, no matter how hard I pressed. I thought about calling the agency, about begging them to send someone else, but the phone was dead, the line nothing but static.\n\nI started to wonder if I’d ever really left the building at all.\n\nThe hours stretched on, time losing all meaning. I read and reread Mark’s journal, the words blurring together, warnings looping in my mind. I tried to remember the rules, to believe that they could still protect me, but they felt hollow now, like a prayer recited long after the faith was gone.\n\nI must have dozed off, because when I opened my eyes, the shack was different. The desk was gone, the monitors dead. The walls were peeling, covered in deep, ragged scratches-HELP, DON’T LOOK, THEY’RE HERE. The air was thick with the smell of rot and dust. I stood, heart pounding, and tried the door, but it wouldn’t budge. The window was black, nothing but a reflection of my own pale face.\n\nI heard music, faint and distant, winding through the halls. I pressed my hands over my ears, but the sound grew louder, wrapping around my thoughts. I heard laughter, high and thin, echoing from all directions. I heard my name, whispered over and over, until it lost all meaning.\n\nI tried to remember the rules, but the words slipped through my fingers, lost in the dark.\n\nI don’t know how long I wandered. The shack was gone, replaced by endless corridors, doors that led to bricked-up walls, rooms that changed every time I blinked. Sometimes I saw Mark, standing at the end of a hallway, mouth open in a silent scream. Sometimes I saw myself, watching from the shadows, eyes empty and cold.\n\nI tried to find my way out, but every exit led back to Ward B.\n\nI found a notebook on the floor, the cover stained and torn. I picked it up and opened it to the first page. The handwriting was mine.\n\n“Don’t go inside. Don’t let them see you. Don’t let them hear your name.”\n\nI tried to remember writing those words, but my mind was blank.\n\nSomewhere, far away, I heard a car pull up outside the gates. I heard footsteps on gravel, the creak of the shack door, the shuffle of a new nightwatch settling in for their first shift. I tried to call out, to warn them, but my voice was lost in the music, swallowed by the laughter and the dark.\n\nThe cycle repeats.\n\nI am still here, somewhere inside Briarwood, wandering the endless halls, searching for a way out. The rules don’t matter anymore. The building has swallowed me whole.\n\nIf you’re reading this, you’re already inside.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"31":{"title":"I Work at a \"Can't Kill\" Shelter.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kabols\/i_work_at_a_cant_kill_shelter\/","flair":"Animal Abuse","author":"JoeMorgue","selftext":"Hi.  My name is… well my name isn’t important I guess. If I’m right everyone will know the details soon and if I’m wrong it doesn’t matter.  Nobody will believe this without evidence and if there is evidence nobody will be able to deny it.  So what I say ain’t a hill of beans, but I need to say it.\n\nI work at a no kill animal shelter.  But it’s not the kind you’re thinking of.  We’re not doing pet adoptions or rehab.  We’re not a rescue.  We’re in a small town down South, middle of nowhere.\n\nWe aren’t a no kill shelter because we don’t want to kill the animals.  We’re a no kill shelter because we can’t kill them..\n\nThe animals here just won’t die.  Or at least they won’t stay dead.\n\nWe house animals that can’t die.  Near as I can tell this started happening back in the 60s.  Story goes, or at least the old timer who had this job before me and taught me everything I know claims that the local shelter, the regular old SPCA shelter, had a dog brought in one night.  Dog had been hit by a car and was in bad shape.  They were trying to get the emergency vet on the phone when the dog just… comes back to life.  But the dog was different.  It could scurry up the side of the wall like a lizard.\n\nAnd then another.  And another.  Animals that both can’t die and are… not normal.  You could take any animal here, pound it flat with a hammer until it was fur and powder, and within a day it’s back to normal.  We don’t understand it.  Or at least I don’t.  The old timers around here are a superstitious bunch and they say it’s best not to think about it.  But it happened more and more as time went on so in the 1980s the town decided they needed a place for them.  There was this old abandoned factory, just outside town, had been a place that made big metal body frames for campers and trailers I think someone said, that had closed in the late 60s.  They gutted it, turned it into this shelter.\n\nWe’ve got 138 animals as of this morning.  All of them weird.  All of them immortal.  Some of them dangerous.  It’s mostly all your normal pet species.  Cats, dogs, a ferret or two, a parrot.  A few others.  We’ve got a bunch of dog sized runs, kind you would see in a normal shelter.  Cages for cats.  Terrariums, aquariums, bird cages of all sizes.\n\n6 guys work here.  Most of the work goes on during the day but we rotate through staying overnight.\n\nWe’ve got dogs.  Lots of dogs.  We’ve got a Great Dane with 6 legs. Adorable but he’s clumsy as hell, tripping over himself.  We love him though.  There’s a small mutt terrier mix we call GiGi who’s got a tongue like one of those chameleon lizards.  You can hold a dog treat out 8 feet from her and she snatches it right out of your hand with it.   That always gets a laugh.\n\nLot of cats too.  A tabby we call Phoenix is actually on the desk in the office while I’m typing this, curled up purring in the top of an old printer paper box with a folded up old towel in it asleep.  She’s hot to the touch.  Not hot enough to burn you instantly like a stove burner but I mean you put your hand flat on her side and it’s so hot you’ll have to pull it away after a few seconds and I guess if you held her to someone’s skin for 30 seconds or so you’d give them a nasty burn.  Amazed she doesn’t set stuff on fired as much random stuff as she likes sleeping on.  One of the many reasons we don’t wear shorts on the job is because Phoenix likes rubbing up against people and that’s no fun with a bare leg.\n\nThere’s Bruce.  Bruce is a common Boa Constrictor.  About 6 feet long.  Actually pretty friendly as far as big snakes go.  Doesn’t cause us any issue but goddamn is he creepy.  His ribs all just jut out from his body about a 6 inches or so and he walks around and climbs the walls of his enclosure with them like a centipede instead of slithering like a normal snake.  I hate the scritch-scratch sound he makes when moving around.  But as long as he has a warm UV lamp to bask under and a thawed rabbit every couple of weeks he’s no real problem at all.\n\nThere’s a flock of cockatiels, 14 of them, all the standard colors and patterns of them that you’d see in a pet store.  We’ve got a nice big cage, the size of a large closet or small room for them.  They all have an extra ridge of small feathers going down their back like a sail and those feathers are sharp enough to cut you.  And they drink blood like vampire bats.  They sing pretty though.\n\nBaron is a ferret but he’s almost 4 feet long.  I mean stretched out, he’s regular ferret size as far as how big his head and limbs are but his middle part between his back and front legs is just like 3 or 4 times as long as a regular ferret.  He kills mice by construction like a snake.  He regurgitates them back out like an hour or so later, we still have to feed him regular ferret food but he gets cranky and bitey if we don’t give him a mouse to eat every week or so.\n\nThere’s a fish tank, normal 60 gallon job we got from the Petsmart next town over.  Got a bunch of those little fish that glow under UV light, Tetras I think they are called.  But these guys don’t just glow they leave these… trails of light behind them as they swim around.  And they don’t need a UV light they just glow all the time.  One of the guys says he don’t like looking at them, says the light trails make his head feel funny.  I think he’s full of shit but I make a habit of always looking away from them every few moments if I’m working near them alone.  No point in being stupid and taking a risk.\n\nSo many more.  Each one weirder than the last.\n\nSome of the animals are dangerous.  We’ve had incidents.  Last fall one of the guys was taking in a new animal, this was a chinchilla.  He broke protocol, picked it up without gloves before the observation period was complete.  The little thing did this little adorable shake like they do when they are in a dust bath and about a dozen quills, like porcupines, just popped out of his body.  Three of them caught the guy right in the palm, another one even went clear through his little finger.  Dude’s throat immediately started swelling up, like an allergic reaction.  We tried the Epi-Pen from the first aid kit but it didn’t make no difference.  We told his family he had been bitten by a rattlesnake.  I don’t think… hell I know they didn’t believe us, but they didn’t press the issue.  The chinchilla is still here.\n\nIf you just use your head these animals are weird and can take you by surprise, but most of them aren’t any more dangerous than handling a normal animal.  So, most days are fine.\n\nMost days are fine.  Except the days when someone has to feed Omega.\n\nWe… we don’t even know what Omega is.  We think he might be a horse.  Or used to be a horse.  He’s big, he’s horse sized.  Quadruped and vaguely horse shaped but the front legs are longer than the back.  And he’s way more heavyset then even like a big draft horse.  His head is horse shaped but the jaw opens way too wide, like a crocodile and the teeth aren’t for eating plants.  Jet black.  He has a mane but the hair is… wrong.  It’s thick and oily and I swear nobody believes me but if you watch closely the hair can move on its own.   He has his own run.  We can’t house him with any other animal. Luckily he doesn’t need to eat often.  We have a two man rule for feeding him.   A buckets worth of butcher meat mixed with alfalfa and some dog food.  He’s very food aggressive.  Hell he's very everything aggressive.  He’s the only animal we have to feed by pushing a tray through a little slot in the bottom of his enclosure with a broom handle.  The second person is on hand to pull you to safety in case anything goes wrong.  We just hose his shit out of the enclosure.  Nobody wants to go in there with him.  We don't like it, we actually do try and treat the animals with respect, but nobody wants get near Omega.\n\nOmega came here about ten years back, a year or so before I started working here.  But I’ve heard the story enough times from the different people involved and they all match up more or less so I reckon this is what happened.\n\nOne night about 11:30 Ricky, he’s the fellow that runs the scrap yard and had the only decent tow truck in town, got a call from Cyrus.  Now Cyrus is this old fart, he would have already been about 65 by that point, who was the closest thing we had to a town bum.  Cyrus was a constant in the town, always begging for money and winding up in jail for getting drunk and starting something.  But hell he never meant no harm.\n\nAnyway, that night Cyrus called Ricky from the payphone on the gas station on the edge of town.  Said he needed the tow truck which Ricky thought was weird seeing as how Cyrus didn’t have a car.  Cyrus said an out of towner’s car had started overheating on the freeway and he had managed to limp the car to the next exit, not knowing the gas station had gone from 24 hours to only day shift months ago, but now it was dead and wouldn’t start.\n\nRicky didn’t even bother to ask what Cyrus was doing up there.  Cyrus was one of those all-purpose bums and one of the places he liked to sleep when no place else was available was out back of the old gas station.  It was safe enough and he could start begging for money and cigarettes early when the gas station opened.\n\nRicky, when he tells this story, always includes the part about how he wished he had just let the phone ring that night or just rolled over and went back to bed.  But he could hear the rain drumming on the roof of the old mobile home he lived in right next to the scrap yard and he couldn’t bring himself to leave someone out in that.  And hell he knew he’d wind up bringing Cyrus back with him, sure as shit.\n\nSo, Ricky put on his big high visibility rain jacket, cranked up his old International 4300 and started heading out to the gas station.  He was halfway there, as he tells it, when for some reason he got on the radio and called the Highway Patrol, just telling him where he was headed and why.  All the Highway Patrol guys, even the overnight dispatcher, knew Ricky well enough, he was the guy they called for wrecks most of the time.\n\nHe got to the gas station just before midnight.  Cyrus was there, sure enough talking the ear off the guy.\n\nSorry I know I’m rambling.  None of this really matters.  I guess I just ain't in a hurry to get to where this story is going.\n\nRicky got the guy’s old Chevy Cavalier up on the flatbed and him, the out of towner, and of course Cyrus climbed into the tow truck’s cab and headed back to town.\n\nThere’s a sharp blind curve coming back to town.  Everyone in town knows about it.  Ricky himself has been onsite for wrecks and people skidding out into the ditch dozens of times.  But that night Ricky was tired, annoyed at Cyrus yakking his ear off, and when he came to that curve and there was an animal in the headlights of his tow truck, combined with that slick road and the fact that you can’t exactly Tokyo Drift in a tow truck with a full load…. Well whatever that animal was he hit it full speed, full force.  Drug whatever it was a quarter mile down the road under the wheels of his truck.\n\nRicky gave a cuss, put on the hazards, got out his flashlight and got out to check the truck for damage.  He was checking the back end, making sure the car was still secured, when he heard…it.\n\nRicky said it sounded like a cross between a gator bellowing and a mountain lion scream.  He whipped his flashlight around, pointing it down the road.  There in the beam was the crumpled heap of whatever animal he had hit.  It was twitching, trying to lift itself up.\n\nRicky had hit animals in the truck before.  It was one of the hazards of the job.  But the International weighed 30,000 pounds and that’s before you put another car on it.   He could hit a goddamn elephant in that thing and the animal would stay down.\n\nIf this thing was still alive, it could only mean one thing.\n\nThe thing that we would later name Omega lifted itself to its full height, its head almost level with Ricky’s, and Ricky’s a big dude.  It made that terrible sound again.  Then it looked at Ricky.  Its eyes locked on him and it growled.\n\nRicky.  Who had driven an MRAP in Iraq for two tours and once had a gun drawn on him by a guy who didn’t appreciate that the bank had hired Ricky to repossess the Dodge Charger that the guy was 4 payment behind on and just laughed in the guy’s face and told him to call the bank with any complaints and continued to load the guy’s car and drove off living the guy standing there pointing his gun at him as he drove off…. pissed himself.\n\nBehind him the door to the cab opened and Cyrus stuck his head out.  “What’s taking so long fer chrissakes?” the old bum hollered.\n\n“Shut up!  And get your ass back in the truck.  And turn out the lights.” Ricky grit teethed whisper yelled back.  He turned off his flashlight. He started back away, slowly.  It was a full moon, and he had enough light to keep the silhouette of the animal in his view as he slowly backed down the length of the truck, back toward the cabin.\n\nThe truck’s lightbar and hazard lights blinked off.  At least Cyrus had enough sense to do that Ricky though.  He grabbed the door handle and in one motion opened it, pulled himself up into the cab, and closed it.\n\nCyrus looked at him.  “What the hell was all that about?”\n\nRicky gripped the steering wheel and took some deep breaths.  “It’s an animal.” he said.\n\nCyrus made a face. “Okay and?”\n\nRicky looked at Cyrus, but then caught the look of the out of towner who was looking at the two locals like they were crazy.\n\n“Cyrus it’s a… one of those animals.” Ricky said.  That even shut Cyrus up.\n\nRicky got on the radio.  “I’m calling the Sheriff”\n\nThe out of towner finally had enough.  “Okay what is this all about?  You two are acting really weird.  What kind of animal did you hit?”\n\nRicky sighed.  Sometimes us locals forget how weird this must be to outsiders.  “Sir I know this is weird, trust me.  Just hold tight.”\n\nOn the radio the voice of the dispatcher crackled back.  “Hey Ricky what’s going on?  What the hell you even doing out this late?”\n\nRicky keyed the radio.  “Yeah Mike I’m out at that bad dead man curve with Cyrus and a customer. I ah… I need help.  I need you to wake the Sheriff and at least one other guy and… better have him rouse a couple of the guys from the shelter on the way here.”\n\nThe radio was silent for a few moments then Mike’s voice, now serious, came back.  “Roger that Ricky.  You okay?”\n\n“Yeah Mike we’re okay just… get them out here quick okay?  Something about this one is… giving me the creeps.”  Mike said.\n\n“I’ll get a rush on Ricky.  Stay safe.” Mike said.\n\n“Thanks Mike.” Ricky said and put the radio headset back in the dash mount.\n\n“Okay what the fuck was that all about?” the out of towner demanded.\n\nMike swallowed hard.  “Sir, I know this doesn’t make any sense.   There’s… there’s a dangerous animal out there.  The police and… animal control will be here soon.  Just stay put.”\n\nHe looked in the review mirror.  He couldn't see the animal.  Somehow that made it worse.\n\nThe out of towner was shaking his head.  “No. This is some kind of scam.  You are trying to shake me down.”\n\n“Sir I assure you nobody is tryi-” Ricky started to say but the out of towner was already opening his door.\n\n“NO!” Ricky yelled but it was too late.  The out of towner slammed the door and started walking down the road.\n\n“Gotdamn idiot’s gonna get his fool self killed.” Cyrus said.\n\nRicky reached down for the radio, intending to call Mike and tell him to put some extra hurry on getting someone out there.  He keyed it but nothing happened.  He cursed.  The truck was still off and had turned off the accessory power after a few minutes to save power.  He cranked the engine.  When he did the headlights turned back on.\n\nThe out of towner had only made it a few hundred feet down the road, if that.  He turned around when the lights turned on, his hand in front of his face.\n\nBehind him, maybe another few dozen yards down the road, Omega stepped out of the woods and onto the road.\n\nThe out of towner, apparently still thinking he was being screwed with, shot them the finger and then turned back around.  And then he screamed.\n\nIt happened so fast.  Ricky said ain’t no right for something that big to move that fast.  Omega bounded down the road, closing the distance in only a few steps and cut the man down with one snap of those huge jaws.  The man’s torso was cut open from shoulder diagonally down and across his entire open body, almost cleaving the man in two.  Omega watched the man’s body fall to the ground.  He leaned down, sniffed it and poked at it with his snout, and pawed at it with his front leg.  Then leaned down and pulled a big chunk of meat away from the body.\n\nCyrus brought his hands to his mouth.  “Oh Jesus, Oh Jesus, Oh Jesus.” he repeated over and over.\n\nRicky was fumbling with the radio.  In the dark and panic he hit the wrong button and a loud squelch of high-pitched feedback blared from the radio.\n\nOn the road, Omega’s head snapped up.\n\n“Fuck oh fuck…” Ricky said.\n\nOmega slowly stalked down the road, its attention now on the truck.  Closer and closer it came.  There was a terrible moment when it got close enough that Ricky and Cyrus couldn’t see it over the huge hood of the truck.\n\nThen with a single bound the creature jumped on the hood, only the windshield between it and them.  Both men screamed.  Omega kicked at the glass, spiderwebbing it.\n\nWhat happened next happened very fast.  Red and blue lights flooded the cabin.  Omega turned his head.  And then the shot rang out.  Omega was blasted off the hood.  Ricky looked over.  A highway patrol cruiser was parked on the shoulder.  The Sheriff, an older gentleman with an old school handlebar mustache, stood there, holding the big Mossberg shotgun, the one they used to stop high speed chases.  He racked it and leveled it again.  He fired again.  And again.  Another officer took position behind the cruiser, his service pistol in hand.\n\nAnother vehicle pulled up.  Ricky recognized it as the old F-250 our Shelter used at the time as a general-purpose vehicle.\n\nThe Sheriff held up a hand, telling them to say in their vehicle.  He walked up Omega, who was on the ground twitching.  He put the big barrel of the shotgun against the animal's ribs, directly over the animal's heart.  He pulled the trigger.  The animal jerked once and fell still.\n\nThe Sheriff stood there for several moments, watching for any movement.  Then he waved the two guys from the Shelter over.\n\n“You guys okay?” The Sheriff yelled at the two men still huddled in the tow truck cab.\n\n“Yes… I think we’re okay” Ricky yelled back knowing he was using a very limited definition of okay.\n\nThe Sheriff walked down the road, to the body.  He looked down, took his hat off.  “Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.” he muttered.\n\nSorry I got rambling again.  I’ve heard this story so many times it’s hard to tell it without all the parts I heard.\n\nThe guys from the Shelter, one of them was the old timer who taught me, loaded Omega up on the truck.  They knew they had to get him somewhere secure before he woke up again.  Sheriff just had the whole road closed off for the rest of the night.  Called for another officer to drive Ricky home and let Cyrus sleep at the station.  Got the coroner out to collect the body.  When morning came they drove Ricky back to drive the Tow Truck back to the scrap yard.  They wrote it up as a traffic accident.  Official story was the driver just lost control on a rainy night and spun out on a well known dangerous curve.  Guy didn’t have any close family so nobody looked too deep into it.\n\nWe kept Omega in an old shipping container for about a week.  Couple of guys from the local metal works made the run for Omega.  It’s heavy high security fencing, the kind they use to keep bears out of the shelters on the Appalachian trail.  Fully enclosed, set in concrete.  Nobody even remembers exactly where the name Omega came from, but someone called him that and it stuck.\n\nCyrus hit the bottle hard and drank himself to death about 3 or 4 years after that night.  Ricky still owns the scrap yard, but he hired a new guy to do the actual tow truck driving.  Of the two guys from the Shelter one of them stayed on until he died of cancer last year, that was the old guy who taught me, the other one tried to stay on but couldn't be around Omega.  He quit and moved out of state.  I was his replacement.\n\nAnd I told you this story.  Sitting here at the desk in the shared office, smoking through an entire pack of cigarettes so fast I might as well have been eating them like candy.  My hands are shaking.\n\nBecause you see Omega’s not in his run.  It doesn’t make any kind of sense.  He was there when I checked on him at the start of my shift and he’s not there now.  Me and one of the day shift guys gave him his dinner, standard two-man procedure like I talked about.  No issues.  Day shift guy went home.  I checked the other animals, feed some of them.  And then I noticed Yertle walking around without his shell.  Yertle’s a Russian Tortoise but he actually can leave his shell, like in the old wife’s tales.  So at least once a shift you have to make sure Yertle hasn’t wandered too far away from his shell and forgot where it was.  So, I did a quick loop around the building, finding Yertle’s shell in front of enclosure with the weird Blue and Gold Macaw we have that has a toucan beak and a full-size lizard tail for some reason, and on the way back to the office I checked on Omega out of habit… and he wasn’t there.\n\nThe run was intact.  No holes in the fence or broken latches on the door.  No signs that he somehow dug under the fence.  Goddamn monster just up and vanished.\n\nI called the Sheriff’s office.  Nobody answered.  I think I can hear sirens in the distance.\n\nI’m scared.  I’m scared of what that creature can do.  Scared of what will happen to me if the town decides to blame me.\n\nBut most of all I’m scared of what happens if Omega comes back."},"32":{"title":"My Brother Went Missing Last Year After Exploring a Local Condemned House.

Today, I’m going to find him.\n\n \n\nThis letter is the last remaining thing I have of William, and as much as I don’t want to go against his final wishes, I *need* answers.\n\nI *need* to find my brother.\n\n \n\n“You read the letter, man. He told you himself not to come after him. I’m sorry, Rich, but I think he’s gone.” Maybe he was right, but on the off chance that he wasn’t, I needed answers.\n\n“But look at what he wrote. He could still be alive.”\n\n“God-DAMN IT, Rich! He told you that he was losing control of his body, he’s gone man. I’m sorry, but he’s *gone*.”\n\nI wanted to tell him to get the hell out of my car, but a small part of me knew he was right.\n\n“Sorry man, I just miss him.”\n\n“Don’t sweat it dude, you’ve got that letter, and I think that’s good enough.”\n\n“You know? I think it is.” It wasn’t.\n\nAnd it was never going to be.\n\n10 PM. Gives me more darkness and I can get home before I have to go to school. My only problem is that mom and dad have been on high alert since William went “missing”. So, I planned to do it on a weekend day. Saturday, specifically.\n\nI had told them I was going to Dylan’s house, and that was my cover to leave and drive to the house on 22 XXXXX Drive. I had brought a flashlight, my phone camera, and my phone itself.\n\nLeaving my car, I walked up to the house. It was just as frightening as William had said it was. One thing scared me more than the house, though. William’s car was parked haphazardly between the lawn and the driveway.\n\nThe keys weren’t in the ignition. I didn’t fret, though. He was still here; he had to be. Why would his car still be here otherwise? Looking around, I saw that I wouldn’t be able to get in very easily, as a wardrobe stood in the doorway.\n\n Luckily, I’m smaller than Will, and the wardrobe was shifted at an angle that would let me squeeze through. Looking through the first floor of the house, I decided to take the same route William did.\n\n I went into the kitchen first. The refrigerator was gone this time. I was a little unnerved by this, because it was very clearly there when William went last year. I checked the cabinets. Snack wrappers and some used mouse trap.\n\nI chuckled a little bit at this. Yeah, mice couldn’t possibly be the worst thing in this house. Finishing up with the cabinet, I turned to the dining table. It was… *empty*? Looking to the floor, the cause became apparent. The dishes were thrown to the floor, their shattered pieces littering the hardwood. Only one fork remained on the table; the fork without a finger attached.\n\nDetermining that there was nothing of importance in the kitchen, I left and went into the living room.\n\nThe couch was missing all but one of the cushions, and that cushion was rotting. Springs and metal pierced through the fabric of the seat and jutted up in a dangerous manner. Not wanting to imagine what it was like to sit on that, I moved forward.\n\nI wasn’t paying attention, so I nearly jumped out of my skin when my face brushed up against something fuzzy in the air. I flailed my arms and smacked whatever I ran into down. Instead of falling, it returned and hit me again. I backed up and shined my light on it. It was a fuzzy fabric keychain.\n\n“You moron.” I whispered to myself, ashamed that a simple key accessory would scare me. It was hanging from the ceiling by a piece of twine, and I grabbed it. Something felt off about this. I looked a little closer and saw something that made my heart drop.\n\nThey were *William’s* car keys.\n\nWho the hell could have done this? I began to panic. Whatever was in here had deliberately set this up, and they had done so for me.\n\nThe keys weren’t bait though, as nothing happened when I took them. They were placed here merely to scare me. I stuffed them in my pocket and continued exploring.\n\nLeaving the living room, I decided I would look at the bathroom later. I headed upstairs. The steps creaked as my weight was put on them, but I wasn’t worried about alerting anyone.\n\n Worst case scenario—I could likely find a place to hide. Knowing what was in the first and second bedroom, I decided to look in the upstairs bathroom.\n\nI didn’t know what I was looking to find, but this kind of thing just doesn’t happen under normal circumstances. The shower curtain was drawn, hiding whatever may have been lurking in the tub. Hesitantly, I took the left end of the curtain in my hand and yanked it to the right.\n\nBefore I could react, a blinding flash overtook me, and I stumbled back. After the spots in my vision disappeared, I looked back into the tub. A camera lay in the middle of it, a string tied to the photo-taking mechanism of the camera. Another scare tactic, I thought. I freed the camera from the string and examined it.\n\nIt felt… familiar. Flipping it around and looking through it, I was impressed; this was a good quality camera. What changed my view were the initials written on the bottom of the camera in reflective chrome marker.\n\n‘W.P.’\n\nWilliam's initials. This was my brother’s camera. I looked at it and the camera began to shake. No—my hands were shaking while I was holding it. This—this had to be another scare tactic, right? I rushed out of the bathroom, panicking now.\n\n I suppose I wasn’t paying attention, because I ran headfirst into something and fell down. Rubbing my sore forehead and looking up, I saw the steps of a ladder. A ladder leading into the attic.\n\nI decided to go up. I didn’t want to stay on the second floor for much longer. Climbing the stairs to the attic, I could feel a change in the air. It felt heavier. The attic was pitch black, and it smelled like a multitude of things.\n\n It smelled old, it smelled like chemicals, and it smelled like *rot*. Looking around, I soon found the reason for the rotten scent. Laying on the floor, was a skin suit. As I examined it closer, I was blown away by how intricate and detailed it was. The suit was a bit rough, but still soft. It was a bit wrinkly and bumpy.\n\n I breathed again through my nose and nearly threw up. This was the source of the rot. I peeled the suit off the ground and a sticky, brown liquid stretched from it and the floor, like glue.\n\nStanding there, holding that pile of skin, it finally hit me: it was *real*. What scared me was not the fact that this was real, it was the physical structure of the skin. If I were to describe it on an actual frame, the person would look malnourished and sickly.\n\n They would look tall and gangly, arms too long for their body, and their feet bare. The head would have been bald. There was no mouth. Instead, it looked like there was a tube of skin with a hole in it coming out of where the mouth should have been. It was similar to the trunk of an elephant.\n\nThis couldn’t have been a normal person, but then, who would have done this? I put the pile of skin down and turned around. Leaving the attic seemed like the only good idea at this point.\n\nClimbing down the ladder, I breathed a sigh of relief. The air felt heavy, so heavy I could almost *taste it*. Heading downstairs, I didn’t care anymore, I needed to get out of this house. I needed fresh air.\n\nAs I neared the entrance of the house, I was horrified to find the wardrobe stuck in the doorway. I *couldn’t* leave. I nearly screamed; I had to find another way out. I looked behind me and saw the bathroom at the end of the hallway.\n\n The room was illuminated by the moon outside. I sprinted to the bathroom and slammed the door, locking it as I did so. Looking to the right, I saw it, my way out. Grasping the bottom part of the window, I went to open it.\n\n*Nothing*.\n\nWhat the hell? I began to panic once more and looked down. The window was nailed shut. As I was attempting to formulate another way out, I heard something; *quick footsteps coming up the basement stairs*. As quicky as I heard the footsteps, I heard what I assumed was the basement door open.\n\nI went back to the bathroom door and double checked that it was locked. After confirming that it was, I backed up to the cabinet. \n\nAs soon as my back hit it, the thing from the basement was at the bathroom door. I heard whatever it was breathing. I didn’t know if it was my fear riddled brain, or if what I was hearing was actually real, but I could have almost sworn that it was *William* breathing.\n\n“Will—is—is that you?”\n\n“……”\n\n“Come on man. Talk to me.”\n\n“……”\n\n“Will, it’s me, your brother. C—come on man.”\n\n“…brother.” Something was wrong. He wouldn’t have been that formal. I suppose I should have come to this conclusion a long time ago, but I was now beginning to doubt that the individual in the other side of the bathroom door was my brother. My mind was divided further when it slid something under the door.\n\nIt was William’s *phone*.\n\nThe patterns were repeating themselves. William experienced this too, albeit in a different way. There was no way out now. If I opened the door, it would get me. If I smashed the window, it could find me. This thing likely did know the house better than I did, after all.\n\nI had deluded myself so far to the point where I thought William was still alive. I knew the whole time that he was dead, I just didn’t want to accept it. I quickly formulated what could be called a plan.\n\nI was going to unlock the door, bust through it, and hit whoever was on the opposite side of it. What I was going to do after that; I still had to figure out.\n\nI psyched myself up and began to do it. I unlocked the door and took a few steps back.\n\n*And then I began to run*.\n\nWhen I burst through the door, there was resistance, which wasn’t surprising. My momentum brought me all the way to the side of the basement door, which was closed.\n\nII turned around, seeing that what I knocked over was…… another old chair? Before I could put the pieces together, I felt a force slam into me from my right side. It sent me crashing through the basement door and I tumbled down the stairs.\n\n By the time I landed at the base of the stairs, I knew something was wrong. The pain in my ankle told me I had broken it during my fall. Grabbing my phone from my pocket, I turned the flashlight on and got up. \n\nLimping to the end of the basement, I could hear it coming down the stairs. It walked *agonizingly* slow. By the time it reached halfway, I was already to the end of the basement.\n\nI looked around. Dozens of corpses littered the basement, although they were a little more decrepit now. They must have gone through the same fate William and Landon did. I imagined an apology for them and continued on.\n\n I was here for one person. I had nearly lost the strength to keep walking at the point I found him, but I didn’t need to worry about getting out now.\n\n*I was going to die here*.\n\nWithered, decaying, whatever words can be used to describe the condition he was in. it was William’s corpse. I had found him. I slumped down next to him and began to cry. Through all of our pain and misery, I had finally found him.\n\nIt was a pretty shitty family reunion if you ask me, but sometimes you need to take what you can get. I went onto the note app for my phone and began typing.\n\n If something was to happen, I would want somebody to know what happened to us. As I finish typing and remove the password from my phone, I can only think of one thing.\n\n*Way to disappoint your brother, Rich*.\n\nAs I look at the thing wearing William’s skin, I put the last of my thoughts together and prepare myself for whatever is about to happen.\n\nThe edge of my hometown. There, a house lies, but you shouldn’t go. It’s a bad place. Something hungry lies dormant within, waiting to latch onto everything it possibly can.\n\nI don’t know what this thing is, and I don’t think I ever will. It took my brother’s friend. It took my brother.\n\nAnd it’s going to take *me* next.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n "},"33":{"title":"Help - I'm stuck halfway inside a wall in an abandoned villa. My phone is dying.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kaxb9f\/help_im_stuck_halfway_inside_a_wall_in_an\/","flair":null,"author":"gamalfrank","selftext":"\n\nAnyone awake? I know it's late... but I don't know what to do and I need to talk or vent, or maybe someone can save me, I don't know... This thing I'm about to tell you is the strangest thing that's ever happened in my life, and maybe the last.\n\nFor a while now, maybe months, I've had a very strange feeling. A feeling I can't exactly describe. Like... like this body of mine isn't quite as solid as it's supposed to be. Like it has a certain percentage of fluidity to it, like thin air. Sometimes I feel that if I concentrate hard enough, if I really believe in this idea, I could... I could pass through things. Yes, just like I'm telling you, pass through walls, for example.\n\nOf course, the first time this idea entered my head, I told myself I was crazy. What is this nonsense? Cheap sci-fi movie stuff. But the feeling wouldn't go away. On the contrary, it grew stronger. I started noticing small things. Once, I was walking in the dark apartment at night and bumped into the edge of the table; I was sure my leg would be sprained, but I felt as if my leg passed inside the wood for a fraction of a second before I actually hit it and felt pain. Another time, I was leaning on the wall while lost in thought, and I felt as if my fingers sank just a tiny bit into the paint, like it was soft putty. Simple things, and maybe hallucinations, of course, but they kept happening.\n\nThis feeling started to dominate me. I began spending hours staring at the wall in front of me in my room, thinking. Thinking about its composition, about the atoms and the spaces between them. And thinking about my own body, about my atoms too. Is it really possible for these spaces to align? Is it possible that willpower, or a deep belief in something, can change the laws of physics? It sounds crazy, I know, والله (by God), but I feel it. It's not just an idea; it's a sensation in every cell of my body.\n\nI started doing small, silly experiments. Bringing my hand very close to the wall and concentrating. Trying to \"push\" with this feeling. Nothing happened, of course, other than my hand touching the cold wall. But inside me, that feeling of \"I can pass through\" kept growing. I started dreaming that I was walking down the street and entering shops through their walls, walking among people like a ghost. I'd wake up with my heart pounding hard, more convinced than ever.\n\nWhen I hinted at something like this to my friends, they obviously made fun of me. \"Ahmed wants to be Kitty Pryde?\" \"Are you going to phase through the wall to steal a PlayStation for us?\" Their words annoyed me, but at the same time, they made me want to prove it to them, and prove it to myself first. The idea transformed from a strange feeling into an obsession, and then into something like an inner certainty – a vague and frightening certainty, but it was there. I had to try. I couldn't live the rest of my life with this doubt. What if I really can? What if this is a special ability inside me, just waiting for me to discover it?\n\nThe problem was, where and how to try? Not at home, obviously. What if I succeeded halfway and got stuck? What if someone saw me? And if I failed and people found out, I'd be a laughingstock. No, it had to be an isolated place. A place where no one knew I was there. A place where I could truly concentrate, and no one would interrupt me or see me if something strange happened.\n\nI searched and asked around about abandoned places near the city. I found talk of a very old villa on the edge of the desert, said to be haunted, and no one had gone near it for years. It was the perfect location. Remote, deserted, and with a reputation that would make anyone think twice before approaching. This was it.\n\nThis morning, I told my family I was going out for a work-related matter and would be late. No one suspected anything. I took my car and headed to the place. The road was long and unsettling. With every kilometer I covered, the hesitation inside me grew, and so did the fear. \"What am I doing? Am I going to throw myself into danger for the sake of a delusion?\" But at the same time, there was a strange excitement, like someone about to discover a dangerous cosmic secret.\n\nI reached the place around late afternoon. The villa truly looked terrifying. Dilapidated, windows broken, covered in years of dust and grime. Surrounded by a low wall, broken in many places. I parked the car some distance away so no one would see it and walked in. The place was eerily silent. Nothing but the sound of the wind whistling through the crumbling walls.\n\nI went inside the villa. The smell of dust and decay hit my nostrils. Dark even though the sun hadn't fully set outside. I wandered through the empty rooms, floors broken and filled with debris. I was looking for the right wall. A wall that was thick, old, a wall you could \"feel.\" I don't know how to describe that sensation, but I was looking for a specific wall.\n\nI found it. An interior wall, roughly in the middle of the villa, in a room that might have once been a large living room or hall. A wall that looked solid and ancient, clearly part of the original structure. I stood before it. My heart was about to pound out of my chest. Sweat was drenching me, even though it wasn't particularly hot inside here. The feeling inside me, that feeling of fluidity, was at its peak. I felt like boiling water waiting to evaporate.\n\nI slowly raised my right hand. My fingers were trembling. I closed my eyes for a moment and tried to gather all my energy, all my belief in this idea. Logic doesn't matter, physics doesn't matter, nothing matters. I will pass through. I have to pass through.\n\nI touched the wall. Cold and solid, like any wall. But this time, I didn't pull back. I kept touching it, concentrating. Breathing slowly and deeply. Trying to \"dissolve\" myself into this wall. Trying to imagine my atoms finding their way between the atoms of the old cement and brick.\n\nAnd suddenly... something happened. My fingers... my fingers no longer felt the solid surface. I felt a different coldness, an internal cold, as if my hand had entered crushed ice but without pain. I slowly opened my eyes. My hand... my right hand, almost up to the elbow... was inside the wall.\n\nOh my God. I couldn't believe it. The sight was surreal. My hand inside the wall as if it had entered thick, dark grey jelly. I felt no pain, but a strange pressure, like a viscous resistance. Joy, fear, and amazement hit my mind all at once. I did it! I actually did it!\n\nDriven by excitement and without thinking, I pushed myself forward a bit. I wanted to get to the other side. I wanted to complete this achievement. My right shoulder went in, then part of my chest. The sensation was the strangest thing imaginable. Like sinking into quicksand, but dry and cold at the same time. I could see with my own eyes the wall slowly \"swallowing\" me.\n\nAnd then... then everything stopped.\n\nI was about halfway through, my entire right side inside the wall, my left side still out in the dark room. And my body... my body froze in place. I couldn't move forward, nor could I pull back. As if I was suspended in a viscous void inside the wall.\n\nI started trying to pull myself back, using my left leg which was still outside. No use. The part of my body inside the wall felt like cement had suddenly been poured over it. I tried pushing forward with all my remaining strength, still no movement. I'm stuck. Really stuck inside a wall in the middle of an abandoned villa in a remote place, and nobody knows I'm here!\n\nPanic started hitting me like a seizure. I'm screaming and shouting, but my voice is muffled in this empty place. I started banging my free left hand on the wall beside me, kicking my foot on the floor. Nothing happens except dust flying around me. I'm trapped. Half of me in one dimension and the other half in another, and the wall is the barrier holding me between them.\n\nThe sensations began to change. The pressure I felt inside the wall is increasing. It's no longer just pressure; there's now like a tingling and a faint pain spreading through my arm, shoulder, and side that are inside. The coldness is intensifying, to the point where it hurts. I feel like the wall... like it's pressing on me, trying to expel me or crush me, I don't know.\n\nHow long have I been like this? An hour? Two hours? I don't know. Time has lost its meaning. All I feel is the cold gnawing at half of my body, the increasing pressure, and the paralyzing fear.\n\nThe only thing I still have is my phone. It was in my left pocket, the side that's outside. With great difficulty, I managed to reach with my left hand and take it out. My fingers are trembling, and I can barely hold it properly. The screen glows in the darkness that has begun to deepen in the place as the sun sets outside.\n\nI'm writing this now while the fingers of my left hand are trembling from terror, cold, and exhaustion. I don't know why I'm writing. Maybe to leave some trace. Maybe so if someone finds this phone, they'll know what foolishness I committed. Maybe to scream at anyone, into the void of this Facebook [social media space].\n\nGuys... if anyone is reading this... I'm in real trouble. I'm in an abandoned villa... in a remote place... I can't describe my exact location but it's in the direction of the... (He tries to remember details but his mind is foggy)... It doesn't matter... No one will reach me in time.\n\nThe bigger problem now... my left hand is getting very tired. My fingers are tingling and I can barely feel them. The phone feels so heavy in my hand. I'm trying to keep hold of it, but it keeps slipping. Each time I grab it again with difficulty.\n\nAnd the battery... the battery is at ten percent.\n\nOh God... what have I done to myself? Was it a delusion? Was it a real ability that I used wrong? Or was this a trap? A trap from this place or something else?\n\nIt doesn't matter anymore. Thinking is pointless now.\n\nI feel the wall pressing harder. The cold has reached my bones. This right half of my body, I can hardly feel it anymore, just a cold, heavy, aching mass inside the wall.\n\nMy fingers... my left fingers are shaking violently. I can't...\n\nThe phone... so heavy...\n\nIt's... it's going to fall...\n\nHel..."},"34":{"title":"I just learnt that my ‘parents’ kidnapped me when I was a baby.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1ka1ig2\/i_just_learnt_that_my_parents_kidnapped_me_when_i\/","flair":"Series","author":"Theeaglestrikes","selftext":"Before I tell you about the present, I ought to tell you about the past.\n\nYou see, this horrible information has lent weight to what was already one of the most terrifying events from my childhood.\n\nMy entire life, I’ve felt keenly observed. Some claim there to be no scientific basis for that sensation—the feeling of a gaze, or many gazes, touching one’s skin. They claim it to be an illusion. As a child, I used to tell myself this, whenever I felt eyes upon me.\n\nBut now I know better.\n\nIn Year 9, Miss Black arrived at our school and became, for only one lesson, the new Religious Education teacher.\n\nShe spent forty-five minutes mystified by me. That wasn’t in my head; my friends commented as much. Her eyes lingered on my face, even when I wasn’t answering a question.\n\nIt made me squirm.\n\n“Are you a Christian?” one girl asked the teacher.\n\n“Religious persecution is part of the human condition, so I keep my beliefs close to my chest,” Miss Black replied, gaze locked on me, not the enquirer. “*Ripe*.”\n\n“What did you say, Miss?” asked another of my classmates.\n\nThe teacher ignored him and continued with the lesson, but we all heard that out-of-place word. My friends repeated it mercilessly for the rest of the day. They joshed me with smooching noises and puckered lips, all while refusing to take their own eyes off me—emulating my supposed “admirer”.\n\nI am grateful for that, however.\n\nGrateful for their steadfast mockery.\n\nGrateful that they clung to my side faux-adoringly as we walked to the buses at the end of the schoolday.\n\nYou see, if my friends hadn’t been there to scream for help when Miss Black attempted to pack me into her rusted Kia, perhaps Mr Alton wouldn’t have rushed forwards in time.\n\nPerhaps I never would’ve been seen again.\n\nFor many years, I woke in a sweat whenever recalling the many elements of that traumatic ordeal, which culminated in Mr Alton shoving Miss Black to the asphalt and rescuing me from the backseat.\n\nI remember Miss Black’s firm fingers clamping around the shoulder pads of my school blazer.\n\nI remember the putrid aroma of onions, cheese, and spices—meals woven into the leather chairs of her car.\n\nI remember the stained pillow and the scratchy blanket, suggesting that she’d been living in there.\n\nI shuddered whenever I imagined what that would-be abductor had in store for me.\n\nBut I may not have been frightened *enough*.\n\nMiss Black was arrested, and my parents moved us to the other side of the country. However, even with that dangerous woman locked away, my fear of being watched only worsened.\n\nA doctor prescribed antidepressants to “help” with my phobia of being watched. Sure, those pills “helped” to dull the fear—helped to dull *all* of my emotions, rendering me a numb adolescent, near-oblivious to the world around me.\n\nBut they were still there. The eyes of the watchers. I just cared significantly less about them.\n\nUntil this weekend.\n\nI came home from university to help Dad with some spring cleaning, as he’d been complaining about clutter in the house; though, it ended up being a matter of spring *reshuffling*, as things were simply being moved into the loft until my parents had the “mental energy” to decide what to do with them.\n\nMy father was quite particular about the tidying process, repeatedly telling me to stick to my side. I’d never been allowed in the attic as a child, and I hardly seemed welcome there as an adult, but Mum had apparently forced him to ask me for help; his back was playing up, so he’d been struggling to carry boxes on his own.\n\nAnyhow, I insisted that I would follow Dad’s rules, which made him soften a little. He conceded that I’d never disobeyed him before, so he’d trust me.\n\nAnd then came the second most frightening situation of my young life.\n\nWhilst we were moving clutter into the loft, my father clutched his chest with fingers bent angularly.\n\n“Dad?” I gasped.\n\nMost oddly of all, my father, legs buckling, seemed concerned only with the cardboard boxes at the side of the room. He tried to shove one in particular off the top of the stack, but both the box tower and his brittle body came tumbling down to the floorboards.\n\nI dropped to my knees beside him, then twisted my head to the open attic door. “*MUM! HELP!*”\n\nA few seconds later, my mother, calling out for an explanation, came flying up the attic ladder. She wailed in horror at the sight of her husband lying half-conscious on the attic floor.\n\nMum hurriedly rang 999, then beckoned me towards her. “Come on, Charlie. Get out of the attic.”\n\nI frowned, eyeing Dad below me. “What? One of us needs to stay with him.”\n\n“Charlie, I won’t tell you—” Mum began, then a voice came from her phone, and she started to descend the ladder. “Yes, it’s my husband! He’s…”\n\nAs she talked to the operator, I found myself focusing on something other than the man lying at my knees, teetering on the precipice of a cardiac arrest. Rather, I was focusing on my parents’ odd behaviour.\n\nDad had knocked the boxes over intentionally.\n\nMum hadn’t wanted me to stay in the attic.\n\nSomething was up.\n\n“Charlie…” Dad wheezed after I’d climbed to my feet and walked towards the toppled box, with a sealed lid, that he’d been trying to hide.\n\nI held up a hand. “Don’t move. Mum’s calling an ambulance.”\n\n“Don’t…” he croaked, exerting whatever strength he had left.\n\nBut every protest only motivated me further.\n\nI knelt before the unlabelled box, held together with sellotape robbed of adhesiveness by time, then I tore the flaps open with ease. Inside were discoloured sheets of paper, coated in orange, mildew, mould, and ink. The sheets were made of fibres that felt like painful bristles to the touch—as if they might draw blood, or burrow beneath my flesh.\n\nA horrifyingly inexplicable sensation that, now, I do not believe to have been imaginary.\n\nThose handwritten documents told a story that sickened me.\n\n*Adam Darin*\n\n*10\/02\/2005*\n\n*Blessed be.*\n\n*11 pounds.*\n\n*Blessed be.*\n\n*Adam smiles for the crescent moon.*\n\n*He is ripe for harvest.*\n\n*Blessed be.*\n\n*He shall end the world of men.*\n\n*He shall lead the chosen few.*\n\n*Blessed be.*\n\nThe poetic ramblings meant little to me, but the date of birth certainly didn’t.\n\nThe 10^(th) of February, 2005. *My* birthday.\n\nMy father painfully pleaded, “Don’t touch them… Please…”\n\nI found an old Polaroid at the bottom of the box, displaying dozens of people standing in a field on a sunny day—a timid moon hung above, half-hidden by the blue of the sky.\n\nThere was nothing immediately odd about the people. They wore ordinary clothes. Denims and cottons. At the front, a blonde-haired couple held a blue bundle between them—a towel cushioning a newborn baby, his cherub face peeking out.\n\nAnd a few feet to the side of them, wearing smiles tinged with falseness and fear, were two adults that caught my eye—twenty years younger, but instantly recognisable.\n\n*Mum and Dad.*\n\n“Stop touching them, Charlie…” Dad begged, and I turned to see him reaching towards me painfully. “They’ll have found us by now…”\n\n“The ambulance is on its way!” Mum called as she hurried back up the attic ladder, and when she saw the relics in my hands, her eyes widened.\n\nIn a demanding tone, I asked her, “*What are these?*”\n\n“You touched them…” she whispered, eyes flitting to the attic window fearfully.\n\n“*Who is this child?*” I growled, jabbing at the picture. “*Why are you and Dad in this picture?*”\n\n“We should’ve burnt that box…” Mum whimpered as she walked over to me. “Maybe it’s not too late.”\n\n“*NO!*” Dad weakly protested, choking on the word.\n\nMum knelt beside him and took his hand. “The operator said we need to get you into a comfortable—”\n\n“Don’t destroy any of it,” Dad pleaded, ignoring his wife’s pleas. “That’ll only make it worse… We have to run… We have to—”\n\n“Are these my real parents?” I interrupted, cheeks red with rage, pointing at the baby in the photo. “Am I Adam?”\n\nMy mum averted my gaze, answering me without saying a word.\n\nAs my fingers gripped the Polaroid’s plastic coating, I heard voices pouring out of the picture. Jubilant voices. Though nothing about their joy put me at ease—it *haunted* me. Haunted me because it felt as if I were bound to a force, both internal and external, unlike any earthly thing I have ever experienced.\n\nHorrified by this sensation, I dropped the contents of the box, and my parents let out a collective sigh of relief.\n\nBut then my free-willed feet carried the rest of my body over to the attic window.\n\nStanding at the other side of the road was a man in a parka. Just a man. An ordinary man. But he was eyeballing me. Looking straight up at the window. He mouthed a word at me.\n\nI don’t know how to read lips, but I’m certain of what he said.\n\n*Ripe*.\n\nHe began to sprint towards our front door.\n\nA shoe sole pummelled against the front door two floors below, and my questions no longer mattered. All that mattered was the very primitive and pressing urge in my head to escape—to survive.\n\nAnd, upon hearing the sound of the intruder, my parents shared a knowing look, before screaming in unison, “*RUN!*”\n\nTerrified beyond words, I slid down the ladder, leaving my sobbing mother and weak father behind. I scurried into my old bedroom, tuning out the sound of wood tearing from hinges downstairs.\n\nFeet pounded across the lobby.\n\nI tore open the bedroom window and eyed the branch of the oak tree a couple of feet away. As the stranger came upstairs and my heart pounded against my rib cage, I took a deep breath.\n\nThen, for the first time since my reckless youth, I jumped.\n\nA cry of frustration came from behind me as I clumsily caught the thick branch like a monkey bar. After scaling down the tree, I looked up in terror to see that man standing in the window, fingers clutching the edge of the frame; he had been a moment from snatching me.\n\nI fled as an ambulance siren filled the street.\n\nFor the past day, I’ve been hopping from bus to bus. I haven’t slept.\n\nI’m too afraid to contact my parents. But now that I’ve put some distance between myself and that horrifying photograph, which seemed to call out to a frightful force I do not understand, I’m starting to see a little more clearly.\n\nYesterday, I needed only to escape.

Dead hospitals. Hollowed-out factories.\n\nThere’s something addicting about walking places that were supposed to be busy and alive—finding them gutted, forgotten, and still somehow breathing.\n\nMe and my friend, Chris, had been planning this one for months.\n\nThe Red Fern Galleria.\n\nClosed down in 2008 after a series of “unexplained structural issues.” Condemned. Fenced off. No one touched it since. Half the town whispered about it; the other half pretended it didn’t exist.\n\nPerfect for us.\n\nWe got in through a service tunnel.\n\nFlashlights cutting narrow tunnels through the dark.\n\nThe smell hit first—mold, copper, and something sour, like meat left out too long. I tried not to gag.\n\nInside, it was worse.\n\nThe floor tiles were warped and buckled like waves. Mannequins were melted to their stands. Dried vines curled up the escalators, reaching toward the broken skylights like dead hands.\n\nNo animals. No bugs.\n\nNo sound except for us.\n\nEvery now and then, Chris would call out a “Hello?”\n\nHis voice would disappear into the dark like a pebble tossed into a bottomless well.\n\nWe made it to the food court.\n\nTables overturned. Stale trays of uneaten food petrified in the ruins. A faded Cinnabon sign hanging by one rusted chain.\n\nThat’s when we heard it.\n\nA faint scratching.\n\nNot random.\n\nRhythmic.\n\nChris swung his light toward the noise.\n\nNothing.\n\nWe waited, breathless.\n\nThe scratching came again—closer this time.\n\nSlow, deliberate, like something dragging its nails along concrete.\n\nThen we heard it breathe.\n\nA shallow, wet rasp, almost like a dog trying to growl with a crushed throat.\n\nMy flashlight flickered, and in that instant between light and dark, I saw it.\n\nLow to the ground. Pale.\n\nLong arms pressed tight to its sides. Elbows bent backwards like a spider’s legs. No hair. No clothes. Just stretched, mottled skin wrapped around a bony frame. Its mouth hung slack—jaw split wider than should’ve been possible—and its eyes were nothing but bulging, milky orbs.\n\nIt grinned at me.\n\nAnd it was fast.\n\nIt scuttled up the side of a derelict Orange Julius stand like an insect. Hands slapping the walls, limbs bending wrong, mouth dragging ragged gasps of air.\n\nChris bolted.\n\nI wasn’t far behind.\n\nWe sprinted through the dead mall, the thing chasing low and fast behind us, nails screeching against tile. Every time I glanced back, it was closer. Smiling. Clicking its broken teeth together like it was tasting the air.\n\nWe barreled into a department store—shelves collapsed, mirrors shattered.\n\nChris dove into a maintenance closet, yanking me in after him.\n\nWe killed the lights.\n\nSat in the pitch black, clutching each other’s arms like kids hiding from the monster under the bed.\n\nWe could hear it prowling just outside.\n\nScrape.\n\nShuffle.\n\nHhhhhhhuuuhh.\n\nScrape.\n\nAnd then…something new.\n\nA voice.\n\nMy voice.\n\nIt whispered my name, low and gurgling.\n\nOver and over, dragging it out like it was savoring the taste.\n\n“Jasonnnn…Jaaaassssoooonnn…”\n\nChris gripped my sleeve so tight it hurt.\n\nThe thing knew us.\n\nIt had seen us.\n\nAnd somehow, it could become us.\n\nChris’s fingernails dug into my arm.\n\nWe stayed frozen in the dark, barely breathing.\n\nThe thing outside scraped slowly back and forth, dragging something heavy across the tiles.\n\nThen it spoke again.\n\nBut not in my voice this time.\n\nIt was Chris’s.\n\n“Jay…c’mon, man. We gotta move.”\n\nHis exact inflection. His cadence. Even the stupid little hitch he had when he was nervous.\n\nExcept…Chris was still gripping my arm. Still right beside me. Still whispering breathlessly:\n\n“That’s not me.”\n\nThe voice outside giggled.\n\nA sick, hollow noise, like a child trying to imitate laughter.\n\nThen it said, again in Chris’s voice, “Jasonnn…I’m over here. You left me.”\n\nChris squeezed my hand tighter. “Don’t. Move,” he mouthed.\n\nThe scratching sound grew louder, more erratic.\n\nIt was hunting by sound.\n\nEvery muscle in my body screamed to bolt—but somehow, we stayed put.\n\nMinutes—or hours, it felt like—passed.\n\nThe scraping eventually faded.\n\nChris risked cracking the maintenance door open an inch.\n\nDarkness. Silence.\n\n“We gotta find another exit,” he hissed.\n\nI nodded, and we slipped out.\n\nWe kept low, ducking between toppled shelves and burnt-out kiosks.\n\nThe mall felt different. Wronger.\n\nThe architecture didn’t match what we’d mapped out online—hallways twisting in strange, impossible ways, storefronts repeating, signage written in gibberish.\n\nAt one point, we stumbled into an abandoned kids’ play area.\n\nSwings hung from the ceiling by loops of black wire.\n\nA carousel turned slowly by itself, though the air was dead still.\n\nAnd that’s when we found the first sign of them.\n\nA backpack.\n\nHalf-crushed under debris.\n\nA dusty Polaroid camera poking out.\n\nChris grabbed it.\n\nThe film inside was fresh enough to still have photos.\n\nHe slid one out.\n\nThe photo showed four people—two men, two women—standing proudly in front of the very same cracked mall entrance we’d come through. Grinning. Middle fingers up at the “No Trespassing” sign.\n\nSomeone had scratched their faces out.\n\nBeneath it, scrawled in shaky Sharpie, were three words:\n\n“IT COPIES SMILES.”\n\nChris swore under his breath, shoving the photo away.\n\nWe kept moving.\n\nNot long after, we found the rest.\n\nA tattered sleeping bag. A broken GoPro.\n\nA shoe, small and child-sized, tangled in rotten vines.\n\nA trail of deep gouges in the floor, like someone had been dragged backward, clawing desperately.\n\nChris stopped dead ahead of me.\n\n“Look.”\n\nThere, standing at the far end of the hallway, was me.\n\nSame torn hoodie. Same blood-streaked face. Same wide, terrified eyes.\n\nIt lifted its hand—and waved.\n\nChris tightened his grip on the flashlight until it creaked.\n\n“That’s not you,” he whispered.\n\nBefore I could respond, it grinned.\n\nNot my smile. Not even close.\n\nIt was a rictus grin—impossibly wide, stretching ear to ear, splitting its skin into raw, glistening cracks. Rows and rows of too-small teeth.\n\nIt took a step toward us.\n\nThen another.\n\nThen ran.\n\nChris moved first.\n\nHe let out a raw, wordless yell and hurled the flashlight straight at the thing’s face.\n\nThe impact cracked against its forehead with a sickening thwack.\n\nThe creature stumbled, its head snapping back at an impossible angle, neck audibly popping.\n\nBut it didn’t fall.\n\nIt straightened—its grin somehow wider now—and lunged.\n\nChris swung a rusted metal pipe he must’ve grabbed without me noticing.\n\nThe blow connected.\n\nThe thing shrieked, this awful, high-pitched childlike wail that rattled my teeth.\n\n“RUN!” Chris bellowed.\n\nI didn’t need telling twice.\n\nWe tore down a side hallway—dim outlines of dead storefronts flashing by—but somehow, I was faster. Chris stumbled behind, cursing under his breath.\n\nI hit a split in the corridor and whipped right without thinking.\n\nBehind me—footsteps.\n\nBut not two sets.\n\nOne.\n\nI skidded to a stop near what looked like a busted maintenance stairwell, heart hammering against my ribs.\n\n“Chris?” I called into the dark.\n\nNo answer.\n\nJust breathing.\n\nWet. Shuddering.\n\nAnd then, from around the corner—my voice.\n\n“Chris! Over here, man! Hurry!”\n\nExcept it wasn’t right.\n\nThe tone was off.\n\nToo eager.\n\nToo hungry.\n\nI backed up, my heel clipping broken glass, heart about to detonate out of my chest.\n\nThat’s when Chris really rounded the corner—blood running down the side of his head, panting hard.\n\nHe stared at me.\n\nI stared back.\n\nTwo Chris’s.\n\nOne limping, battered, clutching a real bleeding wound.\n\nOne standing perfectly still, eyes wide and glassy, smiling just a little too much.\n\nNeither one moved.\n\n“Jason,” the smiling one said. “We have to go.”\n\nThe other Chris gritted his teeth. “It’s that one!”\n\n“Which one?!” I shouted.\n\nBoth reached out a hand.\n\nBoth said, at the exact same moment:\n\n“Trust me.”\n\nI stumbled back another step.\n\nThe thing that was pretending to be Chris took a tiny step forward, fingers twitching unnaturally—too many joints flexing under the skin, knuckles bending sideways.\n\nAnd then its face twitched.\n\nThe smile cracked wider.\n\nTiny, needling teeth pushed up from its gums, replacing the human ones like shark teeth growing in wrong.\n\nIt wasn’t perfect at copying.\n\nIt never was.\n\nI didn’t hesitate.\n\nI swung a broken plank I found on the floor straight into its face.\n\nThe thing let out a gurgling hiss, its skin splitting open like wet paper.\n\nBeneath the torn Chris-mask, I caught a glimpse of the real face again—stretched, raw, grinning so hard its jaw cracked audibly.\n\nIt scuttled back into the shadows on all fours, leaving smears of blood—or something like it—on the cracked tile.\n\nI turned to the real Chris.\n\n“You okay?” I gasped.\n\nHe nodded, grimacing through the blood dripping down his jaw.\n\n“We’re not gonna outrun it. We have to end this.”\n\n“But how?”\n\nHe glanced down the ruined hallway, then pointed toward a sign hanging lopsided off a bent frame.\n\nSECURITY OFFICE.\n\nIf there was anything left in this tomb to help us, it would be there.\n\nWe sprinted.\n\nEvery step felt heavier, like the mall itself was pulling us down.\n\nThe floors cracked underfoot.\n\nThe walls pulsed slightly in the corners of my vision, like something was breathing behind them.\n\nWe made it to the door.\n\nChris kicked it open, and we tumbled inside.\n\nOld CCTV monitors lined the walls, half smashed, buzzing with static.\n\nBut one still worked, barely holding on like a dying flame.\n\nAnd what it showed made my stomach drop.\n\nIt was us.\n\nStanding in the food court.\n\nLaughing.\n\nGrinning.\n\nLooking happy.\n\nExcept we weren’t alone.\n\nBehind our smiling copies, dozens—hundreds—of other figures crept closer.\n\nAll wrong.\n\nAll twisted in that same broken way.\n\nThe screen flickered.\n\nThe figures on it turned.\n\nLooked straight at the camera.\n\nAnd smiled.\n\nChris slammed the door shut and jammed a broken chair under the handle.\n\nThe air inside the security office was thick—like it hadn’t been breathed in years. Dust floated in the beams of the dying flashlight. The CCTV monitor buzzed faintly, still showing that twisted mockery of us laughing while the things gathered behind.\n\nI could hear them now.\n\nSoft skittering outside.\n\nTap-tap-tap of nails against tile.\n\nLow, wet breathing just beyond the door.\n\nChris grabbed an old fire extinguisher from the wall and hefted it like a weapon. I found a broken length of pipe near one of the desks. We didn’t say anything—we didn’t need to.\n\nThere was no way out.\n\nWhatever that thing was—whatever they were—they didn’t want us gone.\n\nThey wanted us replaced.\n\nChris knelt down beside the door, jaw tight, eyes darting around for anything else we could use.\n\nThere wasn’t much.\n\nA few filing cabinets. A rusted vent too small for either of us to squeeze through.\n\nDead radios.\n\nDead hope.\n\nThe first hit came a few minutes later.\n\nA soft bump against the door.\n\nFollowed by another.\n\nAnd another.\n\nThen the wood cracked.\n\nTiny fissures racing across its surface like spiderwebs.\n\nThey weren’t rushing.\n\nThey were playing.\n\nI pressed my back against the far wall, pipe clutched so hard my hands ached.\n\nChris’s breathing was shallow, fast.\n\nThe monitor flickered again.\n\nNow the copies weren’t just laughing.\n\nThey were waving at us.\n\nHundreds of them.\n\nSmiling.\n\nWaving.\n\nInviting.\n\nThe door splintered.\n\nA hand—long, white, too many joints—pushed through the gap.\n\nThe fingers groped blindly, questing.\n\nChris swung the fire extinguisher, smashing the hand back.\n\nThe thing let out a high, keening noise—angry, hungry—and pulled away.\n\nFor now.\n\nWe dragged the filing cabinets in front of the door.\n\nPiled everything we could against it.\n\nBut I know it’s not enough.\n\nThey’re just waiting.\n\nThey want us scared.\n\nWeak.\n\nReady to be copied perfectly.\n\nI don’t know how much longer we can hold out.\n\nMinutes, maybe.\n\nIf anyone out there knows anything—anything at all about what these things are—how to fight them, how to stop them—please.\n\nPlease tell me.\n\nI don’t want to die here.\n\nI don’t want to become…one of them.\n\nI can still hear them laughing.\n\nAnd it’s getting harder to tell which laughter is theirs.\n\nAnd which is ours.\n\n"},"37":{"title":"I threw my cigarettes out in the marsh, until I realized something lived there.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1ka73hu\/i_threw_my_cigarettes_out_in_the_marsh_until_i\/","flair":null,"author":"Global-Dance-3402","selftext":"I became a smoker when I was 16. I stole two cigarettes that my older brother left on the dashboard of our car. In my head, I could blame this on his carelessness. I didn’t even have any reason to start smoking. I just wanted to know what it was like. Curiosity killed the cat and all that.\n\n\n\nA week after I had found them, I waited until it was past eleven and the house was asleep. I opened my window and climbed out onto the back roof overlooking the marsh. I used a candle match to light it. Funnily enough, I actually lit the filter instead of the tobacco end, and I sat there wondering what all the buzz was about. It tasted vaguely burnt, and I couldn't even blow out the smoke like I’d seen in movies. I stubbed it onto the windowsill and chucked it into the marsh, too scared of my parents' wrath to try and dispose of it any other way. \n\n\n\nI watched the orange spark still left on the end of it disappear into the long grass until the darkness enveloped it. Of course, now I know I was being careless, but back then I was too self-absorbed to think about the animals or the possibility of a wildfire. All I really cared about was not getting in trouble.\n\n\n\nThe second cigarette I’d ever smoked, I smoked it properly. It was broken in half with the tail hanging off, so I broke off the end of it and lit the paper still left. The filter was in my mouth this time, and I suddenly got why my entire family risked lung cancer every day. I held it between my two fingers and felt so unbelievably cool when I released the smoke in my mouth. The vague burning was more of an ash this time, stuck on my teeth and the back of my throat. I cannot explain what was so pleasant about it. As I’m sure any smoker could tell you, you don’t know why they do it until you’ve done it. I stubbed it shortly thereafter, since there wasn’t much paper to burn. But the damage was done, and I was hooked. I knew when I chucked it into the marsh grass that it would not be the last time, and that fact settled over me with a finality I accepted quickly. \n\n\n\nI brushed my teeth thoroughly after every smoke break. It started just at night, and then in the evenings after school when I knew my mother would be cooking dinner. Anytime I was stressed, I needed a cigarette. I craved the burn at the back of my throat. I wouldn’t say I was fully addicted at that point, since I was limited in my supply. I would be able to steal one or two a week, and even when I eventually started buying them off kids at school, I was too lazy to get a job and could only afford a pack once a month. \n\n\n\nEven as my habits changed, the place I smoked them never did. I still sat perched on my rooftop, feet dangling over the edge, and when I was done I would chuck them as far as I could into the marsh grass. It became a game in my head, if I could get farther than the last one. How long I could still see the ash in the dim sky. \n\n\n\nOnce, at two or three AM, I was splayed out over the roof on my back. The cigarette between my fingers was almost finished and when I held it in the air to blow out, it fell directly on my face. I cursed and sat up, twisting it into the roof in frustration. But, out of the corner of my eye, I saw something in the marsh. I spun my head around and saw the dark figure of a tall man. His silhouette was odd and unnerving, body too skinny to hold a head that large. He stared at me, arms at his side. I nearly fell off the roof. I used the heels of my boots to push myself up and grabbed the window sill. I shut my eyes tight as I climbed back through and plopped down on my bed. I whipped around to shut and lock my window. I snuck a peak out of the blinds but he was gone. I’ve never been sure if I actually saw something out there. I was tired, and unless he laid himself down in the wet mud or gained superspeed, I couldn’t figure out how he’d gotten out of my sight within that minute. It frightened me out of smoking for all of a week, and then I was back to my old habits. Except now, I smoked in the park. My window remained locked until I moved out. I still thought I saw him out of the corner of my eye sometimes, but I was also always known to be paranoid.\n\n\n\nI’m 28 now. I quit smoking last year when I got pregnant with my daughter. My husband and I are living in an apartment a long way from my childhood home. We’re on the final floor, high in the air with no balconies or ledges for my daughter to sneak out of when she’s older. Quitting smoking was one of the best decisions of my life. I have more money in my pocket to spend on my little girl. My anxiety has almost entirely ceased.\n\n\n\nLast week, I burnt dinner. It wasn’t a big deal, but the kitchen stunk. I decided to slide open a window to let some air in. \n\n\n\nI dropped the glass of water I was holding. It shattered on the floor. My husband ran over and found me confused, a hand up to my open mouth.\n\n\n\nOn the window sill, 400 feet in the air, was a mound of burnt cigarettes. Long pieces of grass were poking out of it, covered in mud. \n\n  \n"},"38":{"title":"Beneath the Junk, My Mother Found a New God to Worship","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1ka12sj\/beneath_the_junk_my_mother_found_a_new_god_to\/","flair":null,"author":"SkullKnitter","selftext":"My mother was a hoarder.

That one day she would stack old magazines on top of the oven coils, flick a switch, and burn the place down. Maybe it is an only child thing to worry about your parents this much. I do not have siblings to check in, and my father’s been gone ten years now. She is all I have left.\n\nI know she has broken pieces in her brain. I know something dark happened to her, maybe my father’s death, maybe something even older. Something pushed her mental state like a twig, pushed until it snapped. She had always been messy, but after dad passed, it became so much worse.\n\nA couple weeks ago, I tried to call for the first time in a while. A robotic voice told me her service had been disconnected. I thought about a wellness check, calling the police, but I knew the cracks in her mind seeped deeper than just hoarding. She could be unpredictable.\n\nBesides, I figured she probably just spent too much of her social security checks on lotto tickets and Marlboros. Forgot to pay the bill.\n\nAfter a few days, I grew worried. I took the rest of the semester off, dropped my classes and ate the fee. I bought a plane ticket home. It was not just about the lack of phone service, that was only the nidus for a conversation that had been long overdue.\n\nWhen I arrived, I thanked my taxi driver and watched the yellow blur disappear down the road. Immediately, I was shocked at the state of my childhood home. The grass was months overgrown. Milkweeds grown as tall as my hips swayed in the breeze. The chain-link gate rustled back and forth. It was a small home, two-story.\n\nI found it odd how all the blinds were drawn, yellowed and sun-bleached behind the dirty glass. Several magazines still wrapped in plastic sleeves sat on the porch, and pink and yellow notices were stuck to the knob. I opened the mailbox, it was stuffed full of junk mail and past-due bills.\n\n“Momma. You haven’t been keeping up on the bills?” I sighed.\n\nI looked around. The whole neighborhood looked worse for wear now. Maybe it was the foggy lenses of childhood innocence crumbling away. Being back made my gut feel like a stone sinking deep into a pond.\n\nI approached the front door and rattled the handle. Locked. I rang the doorbell and waited. Nothing. I knew where she kept the spare key for the back door. I turned and moved down the steps.\n\nThe neighborhood was dead. No familiar faces. Only me and the faint rustle of breeze and the distant sounds of low-middle-class suburbia.\n\nI walked beneath the awning of the carport, passing mom’s silver Honda. Dust covered the windows.\n\nHow long had it been since she drove this thing?\n\nThe spare key was hidden inside a fake rock. I had told her before it was a bad idea, but right now I was grateful.\n\nThe lock clicked easily and I slipped inside. Immediately I was hit with the foul odor of decay. I had taken a deep inhale without thinking, and I turned and wretched into the weeds. I suspected the worst. I thought about dialing 9-1-1, but I had to see for myself first.\n\nI held my shirt over my nose and slipped back inside. The house was dark. The hoarding had worsened since I last saw her. Still not insurmountable amounts, not enough to poison the bones of the home, but not good either.\n\nI saw him laying in the living room. Mr. Whiskers. Flies buzzed in the slits of light from the blinds. Maggots writhed in his almost fully decayed corpse. I swallowed the rising tide of bile, my fingers shaking.\n\nPoor Mr. Whiskers. She loved that cat. A deeper pang of fear struck like the tip of a knife.\n\nIf she had let this happen to him, something must be wrong.\n\nI grabbed my cell phone and called the police. They had a few cruisers out faster than I expected. A team of officers wearing blue latex gloves combed through the place. After some time, one sat me down on the front porch.\n\nShe wasn’t inside. They looked in every crevice, beneath every teetering pile. They were thorough and concluded there were no signs of foul play, no signs of forced entry. It was as though she had just vanished.\n\n“When did you see her last?” a mustached, greying police veteran asked me. His badge read Officer Mathers.\n\n“We haven’t been talking as much recently… I’ve been busy with school… and she can be a difficult person to communicate with sometimes. It’s been at least four months.”\n\nThe cop nodded sympathetically. Scratched at his chin.\n\n“Does she have any friends, family she could be staying with?”\n\nI shook my head. I knew my mom could rub people the wrong way.\n\n“She didn’t keep friends around, too much fuss. No other family really.”\n\nGod, I could have been talking about myself. I couldn’t tell if that hurt worse than saying it about Momma.\n\n“Okay. That about clears up my line of questioning. I do have one thing I need to show you inside.”\n\n“Oh. Okay, sure.”\n\nThe other cops were filtering out now, returning to their squad cars. I followed Officer Mathers inside.\n\nHe led me up the creaking stairs. Boxes and old furniture lined each side. The house had aired out a little, but it still held an underlying aroma of dust, the smell from Mr. Whiskers dampened but lingering.\n\nOfficer Mathers flicked away a fly buzzing near his face.\n\nUpstairs, he led me to the master bedroom. Junk had been pushed to the far corner. Her bed was pushed to the opposite wall from where it usually sat. The old floral comforter was disheveled.\n\nRed lines adorned the walls and ceiling. Mad ramblings.\n\nDoorway to the nine divine blessings.\n\nPartake of the flesh.\n\nThe god of Dreck.\n\nBetween the writing there were patterns. Sharp pointed arrowheads interspersed with weaving circular lines.\n\nGod, she’d really lost it.\n\nOn the wall to my left, where the bed once sat, there was an outline in red shaped like a doorway, the size of something you’d see in a children’s playhouse. Red arrows of all shapes and sizes pointed to it.\n\n“Oh no…” I muttered aloud.\n\nOfficer Mathers walked over to the red outline and pressed a hand down on the grey wallpaper. Nothing. His hand didn’t get sucked through. His arm didn’t reveal any hidden hatch.\n\n“I’ve seen cases like this before. Paranoid schizophrenia, delusions.”\n\n“Hoarding,” I interjected.\n\n“Yes. Hoarding too. Look, you seem bright, so I won’t lie to you. This doesn’t bode well. If we find her, I’d recommend looking into treatment. How old is your mother again?”\n\n“She’s only fifty.”\n\nIf we find her. Those words lingered like smoke in my mind.\n\nHe sucked in a breath, looking around the room.\n\n“And I hate to bring this on you at such a time. But I am obligated to report this.”\n\nHe swept a hand at the mounds of trash.\n\n“It’s breaking fire codes, city ordinances. We need it cleaned up for her safety. I will give you some time. But when I swing back here in a few days, I want to see some improvement or I’ll have to get the city involved. Understand?”\n\nI nodded. “I’ll spend some time cleaning it up.”\n\nAnd I did just that.\n\nI dipped into my savings and rented a dumpster that was parked in the driveway. I bought all sorts of cleaning equipment.\n\nMr. Whiskers was the first thing to go. His carcass had flattened into a firm disc, and I tried not to hurl at the sight of the maggots. There was a deep brown stain in the carpet where he had decomposed. It looked like something had been chewing at him. Once I tossed him in the dumpster, the smell inside the home immediately improved.\n\nI called around and paid the bills. Thankfully, the house itself had been paid off, so all I had to do was catch up on the utilities, which were two months overdue. I got the power and water restored that day.\n\nThen came the hard work. I tossed out broken lawn chairs, boxes of soiled newspapers dating back to the 70’s. I managed to clean out the whole living room by the time the sun started to dwindle.\n\nI have a tendency to work through pain rather than face it. I laid down on the old musty couch, sweat dripping down my brow, when I heard a knock come from upstairs. I startled awake, staring up at the ceiling. It sounded like it came from up there. From right above me.\n\nI stood and moved up the stairs, turning on lights as I went. Most bulbs were burnt out, but a few flickered to life.\n\nI rounded the corner, cautious.\n\nKnock.\n\nThe sound was coming from the master bedroom. When I rounded the corner, I saw the lettering and symbols inside the room glowed with a faint red luminescence. It reminded me of bioluminescent algae you’d see down in the crushing depths of the midnight zone.\n\nWhere the small red doorway was outlined, there was now a yawning black mouth. Seeing it sent the hairs rising on my arms. I felt a deep sense of wrongness. Hard to explain what it is like seeing your sense of possibility slip away. The feeling of your internal lines blurring. A skeptic seeing a ghost manifest right in front of them.\n\nWhat I was seeing was impossible. But there it was anyway, tearing a hole in my reality.\n\nI did the only thing I could think of. I grabbed the bed and shoved with everything I had, grinding it across the floor until it thumped against the far wall, blocking the hole. I backed out of the room, which opened outward, and shoved a chair from the kitchen beneath the door handle.\n\nI settled back down on the couch, struggling to sleep, imagining what loomed upstairs. That glowing doorway. That tunnel that looked as though it went on forever, collapsing inward like a wormhole.\n\nKnock. Knock.\n\nI gazed upward. It came again from above me. My heart beat faster.\n\nI leaned towards the wall, hesitated, then knocked three times in rhythm.\n\nKnock knock.\n\nI felt nauseous. I slumped beneath the blanket I was using, trying to focus on my phone. I heard the bed sliding away from the wall, a deep groan of wood biting wood. Then the sound of heavy hands, feet, something on all fours scuffling across the room. Pacing back and forth. A dog in a run.\n\nThe doorknob rattled upstairs. I heard the hinges groan and creak under the weight of something flexing its body against the door.\n\nThe pattering resumed. The slap of hands shifting around above me.\n\nSome primal part of my brain, some old loose neuron firing deep inside my skull, told me that whatever was crawling around up there was not my mom.\n\nKnock.\n\nThat seemed to confirm it.\n\nI laid there for hours, teeth gritted, clutching my blanket to my chest. Irrationally, I stayed there all night. I didn’t have anywhere else to go.\n\nThe light cut into the room through the dirty glass. A ribbon of sun landed on my face. I woke up gasping, looking around frantically.\n\nThe house was silent, except for the titter of birds outside. The night before felt like a fever dream.\n\nI slipped on sandals and pulled clean clothes out of my suitcase. After brushing my teeth and changing out of my sweat-soaked tank top, I moved upstairs.\n\nThe chair was still pinned beneath the doorknob. I moved it aside and stepped into the room.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was how the bed had been shoved back, sideways, upheaved against the wall. I knew I had moved it the night before.\n\nAnd there was no yawning mouth in the door.\n\nI decided the rest of the cleaning could wait. I needed answers.\n\nThe blinds in the room were closed, but an orange glow crept in from the edges. I grabbed a staple gun and a heavy black trash bag. I stapled it in place, layering two more bags over it until not a speck of light entered.\n\nThe room was drenched in a deep shadow. I saw the slight glow of red fill the space like a burning nebula. Some light crept in through the crack beneath the door, so I shoved a blanket against it.\n\nI heard a muffled sucking noise as a black square filled the spot it had yesterday. I wasn’t delusional. It was there. Only this time, I smelled old compost baking in the sun. The fetid stench of an unkempt outhouse.\n\nI found a measuring tape and approached the doorway. I am petite, quite short. The only way I would be able to fit through was to crawl on hands and knees.\n\nI got close, the stench clinging heavy to the air. The doorway looked like an illusion, the folded edges seeping into the void like a coin spiraling into one of those mall funnels.\n\nI eased the tape measurer forward. It clipped through the mask of darkness and I saw the wall shiver around the rattling yellow line. I continued to push it forward.\n\nAt four feet in, I felt it touch something unseen. Like a fishing lure scraping a lake bottom, a fisherman feeling for tension.\n\nI pushed it to six feet. Eight.\n\nSuddenly, a rattling tension yanked through the line. Something grabbed the end. The tape whipped through my fingers, slicing a groove into my palm. I gasped at the jolt of pain. The tape made a rattling din as it disappeared into the void.\n\nThe case was ripped from my hand, sucked into the wall. I shuffled backward, palm bleeding.\n\nEven out of sight, I heard the tape rattling. Then it shot back out.\n\nThere was a pause. I stared at the gaping darkness.\n\nSomething came whipping through the air inches from my head, crashing into the wall with a whip-crack. I heard the measuring tape clatter to the floor. I turned to see a deep wound in the drywall. The tape measurer lay smoking where it landed.\n\nNo words were spoken, but the message was clear.\n\nGet out before I hurt you.\n\nA deep gurgling noise came from the small doorway. The sound of someone drowning, choking for air. Movement approached.\n\nThen frantic tapping against the walls.\n\nI rushed forward, ripped the trash bags down, and bathed the room in light. My pupils dilated painfully against the sudden brightness.\n\nThe black doorway was gone.\n\nI wrapped a towel around my bleeding palm and dusted off an old first aid kit my mom kept in the bathroom. As I cleaned and bandaged the wound, a realization crept in slow and cold.\n\nThe police were not going to find my mom. If there was any chance of finding her, it was up to me.\n\nThe thought wrapped itself around my ribs like a wire tightening. Anxious thorns pressed inward with every breath.\n\nI am an intense introvert with obsessive tendencies. Doing this would require more from me than I thought I had. But what other choice was there? She was my mother. My blood. The last person in the world I felt connected to.\n\nAnd if she was still alive, she needed my help.\n\nThe decision made itself.\n\nI walked to the local hardware store and bought the most powerful construction lights I could find, two caged work lights with thousands of lumens. I stopped by an outdoor outfitter and picked up a harness, carabiners, ascenders, descenders, a static rope long enough to drop through the doorway, and a high-lumen headlamp.\n\nWhen I arrived home with a stolen shopping cart piled high with gear, a heavy fog had rolled across the neighborhood. The sky churned with a roiling tide of thunderclouds.\n\nThere was a hum in the air. I noticed for the first time the for sale signs posted on the lawns around my mom’s house. Maybe they too felt the ripple in the air. Maybe that was why the neighborhood was a dried husk now.\n\nThe air smelled like gunpowder. I tasted ash, like the cinders of a forest fire. The mist swallowed the world whole.\n\nAs I entered the house, a tail of fog curled in behind me. I closed the door against it. I felt like a diver standing on the white sand precipice of a great ocean cliff, watching alien shapes loom in the abyss below.\n\nI set up the construction lights in the master bedroom. In the background, the knocking came steady from within the walls. Like dripping water from an old pipe.\n\nKnock… knock… knock.\n\nThe air was heavy with dampness. A cineral hue seeped into the walls. The whole house felt like it was breathing.\n\nI flicked on the lamps, bleaching the room in merciless white light. I wasn’t ready to go through the portal yet. I needed control first. Some measure of it.\n\nClearly the doorway was bound by rules. Light seemed to be one of them. The glowing runes too.\n\nI rummaged through my mom’s belongings. Boxes of junk, old papers, magazines. Nothing useful.\n\nHours later, I found a bound leather journal shoved between the mattress and the bedframe. Alongside it, a bottle of ink and a fountain pen.\n\nWhen I uncorked the bottle, it smelled metallic, like blood, mingled with the scent of charcoal.\n\nThe scrawls inside the journal were nightmarish. Icons of people skinned alive, stretched out and pinned to columns like grotesque angels. Mountains of garbage rose around them.\n\nMy mom’s mind had not just broken. It had been twisted, reshaped into something alien.\n\nI flipped pages. Symbols that cut the paper with their symmetry. Jagged words I didn’t understand.\n\nThe journal unsettled me. There was no clear information inside, nothing I could use.\n\nI set it aside and refocused on the goal. On my mission.\n\nIn the attic, I found my father’s old rabbit rifle, a box of .22 caliber shells. I grabbed a rusted two-bit axe from the shed outside. Found his old Alaskan wolf trap too, a monstrous thing built for bears and wolves. I drenched the mechanism in WD-40 until the joints moved smoothly again.\n\nSomething else caught my eye beneath a pile of bird cages. A gallon of gasoline for the mower. I grabbed that too.\n\nA plan started forming in my mind. Reckless. Stupid. But it was all I had.\n\nMy eyes flicked back to the scrawling on the wall.\n\nThe god of Dreck.\n\nThe thing I heard crawling that night, it wasn’t a god. No divine being of filth and trash. It was a parasite. A leech, hardwired to feed.\n\nI was going to make it bleed.\n\nThe world outside dimmed, the sun shrinking like a bruised orange behind a blanket of clouds.\n\nStacks of boxes loomed against the walls. I felt an ache in my collarbone where it had been pinned together with screws years ago. A memory from sixth grade. An old pain resurrected.\n\nMy palm throbbed under the gauze.\n\nIt took all my weight and several tries to set the wolf trap. When it finally clicked down with a heavy clank, I slid it carefully into place in front of where the yawning doorway would appear.\n\nI loaded the rabbit rifle, thumbing in the cartridges one by one. Small rounds, but they would have to do.\n\nI set the construction lights up but kept them unplugged for now, ready to blaze at a moment’s notice.\n\nI kept the gas can within reach. A last resort.\n\nOutside, the world was swallowed in swirling white fog. Dew clung to the glass. I stapled more trash bags over the window, throwing the room into complete darkness.\n\nThe faint red glow crept back to life. The doorway started swirling again, the wall beyond vanishing into the growing void. The stench of rotten wood and stagnant water filled the air. I heard the faint clinking sound of coins rattling in a jar.\n\nA frantic tapping started against the walls.\n\nThe gurgling noise returned, low and wet.\n\nThe blackness in the doorway swelled and pulsed. The walls vibrated under the pressure.\n\nI shuffled back, rifle aimed at the center.\n\nThe red glow pulsed.\n\nAnd then it appeared.\n\nNot a face. Not exactly.\n\nIt was an exposed nerve pretending to be a face. Skinless, spasming, muscle flickering with twitches. Bone jutted in the wrong places. A stretched and melting human face buried halfway through a horse’s skull. Holes gaped where eyes should have been.\n\nIt pulled itself forward on too many limbs. Stick-thin appendages folded like broken insects.\n\nSNAP.\n\nThe wolf trap clamped shut across its midsection with a sound that was half metallic clang, half meat rupture. A gout of blackened pus exploded sideways across the floor, steaming where it hit the old wood.\n\nThe creature screeched. Not from a mouth. It screeched inside my head, a sound that cracked against my bones and drove straight into my spine.\n\nIt thrashed, pinned. Half its body still inside the portal. Half stuck in our world.\n\nThe trap held.\n\nIt was caught.\n\nIt wasn’t dying yet.\n\nBut it was vulnerable.\n\nIt spasmed, yanking against the trap, slick limbs scraping and slapping at the floor. The iron teeth of the old Kodiak trap were buried deep, grinding bone and viscera. Thick black ooze poured from the wound, steaming where it touched the floorboards. It wasn’t bleeding like anything natural; what came out looked more like oil, or tar laced with static. It kept twitching, frantic, trying to drag itself free. But the trap held.\n\nI grabbed the construction lamp’s cord, dragging it forward, inch by inch, until it hovered near the thrashing edge of the portal. My fingers trembled. The creature went still. It knew. It jerked once, violently, trying to pull back, but the trap only bit deeper. It was stuck. Snared.\n\nI shoved the plug into the socket. The lamps blazed to life, a brutal wash of white light flooding the room. The creature screamed, but not out loud; the scream rattled my ribs, cracked against my teeth, a deep psychic howl that vibrated the marrow in my bones. The portal rippled violently. The walls buzzed with heat as the red runes burned brighter. The light hit the threshold. The portal cinched tighter. Its edges trembled like a clenched jaw. The creature thrashed once more, a final desperate spasm. And then the wall bit down.\n\nThe trap groaned under the strain. There was a crunch, wet and final, as the thing was severed cleanly in half. The portal’s edges cauterized white-hot, sealing shut as the top half of the creature collapsed onto the floor. The lower half, still trapped, twitched once before slumping into a pile of glistening black muck. The stench was unbearable. Wet mulch and rotting meat mixed with something sickly sweet. It filled the room like a living thing, crawling into my nose, my mouth, my skin.\n\nThe lightbulb flickered once, whining under the strain. The portal spasmed again, glitching like a corrupted video feed. I raised the rifle, pressed the barrel to what was left of its twitching face, and pulled the trigger. The head exploded like a rotten melon, black ichor splattering the wall behind it. Wisps of smoke curled from the barrel. My heart hammered in my chest.\n\nThe twitching slowed. But it didn’t stop. The half-corpse slumped, leaking thick black fluid that puddled on the floorboards, bubbling and popping with tiny bursts of static. The rapping on the walls pitched higher. Faster. Maybe it wasn’t the creature knocking after all.\n\nI clicked off the work lights. Slowly, the portal re-formed. It rippled back into existence like a wound peeling open. There it was again. That impossible dark. Blacker than anything that should exist. The kind of black that swallows light, memory, and meaning itself.\n\nBut this time it wasn’t empty. This time the knocking was louder. Steady. Beckoning.\n\nI clipped the climbing rope to my harness, double-checked the anchor wrapped around the bedframe. The rope hummed faintly with tension as I tested my weight. I clicked on my headlamp. The cone of light pierced into the void, swallowed almost instantly by the darkness. The doorway pulsed at the edges, breathing.\n\nNo more hesitation.\n\nI took one last breath, thick with sweat, gunpowder, and the lingering stink of the creature, and dropped to my knees. The static whine clawed at my ears, like nails dragging across vinyl. I lowered myself forward, palms sinking into the blood-soaked carpet where the black fluid had seeped. I crawled through.\n\nThe temperature dropped instantly. Not just cold. Abyssal. It leeched the warmth from my bones. The space beyond didn’t make sense. Angles bent wrong. Distances shifted when I looked away. I turned, expecting to see the bedroom behind me. There was only more tunnel. The door was gone. Or hiding.\n\nAhead, a faint amber light leaked through the folds of the tunnel. Shadows slanted across the uneven ground. The walls pulsed and breathed shallowly, like living tissue. I crept forward.\n\nThe knocking grew louder. And I realized it wasn’t knocking anymore. It was scratching. Fingernails dragging across soft meat. Close. Just around the bend.\n\nI edged forward, every step a prayer. The tunnel widened, just enough for me to stand in a crouch. A sickly amber light poured from somewhere deeper, painting the walls in shades of old blood.\n\nI saw them then. Shapes fused into the walls. Organic lumps. Some twitching. Some still. Sacs of flesh, breathing gently like sleeping lungs. The air was wet and heavy with the stink of rot and something worse.\n\nAnd then I heard her voice. Weak. Wet.\n\n“…help…”\n\nIt came from deeper inside.\n\nI rounded the corner.\n\nAnd I saw her.\n\nShe was stretched impossibly across the far wall, her arms splayed wide, ankles twisted unnaturally. Her torso had been peeled open and spread outward, fused to the living structure of the tunnel like macabre wallpaper. Her head lolled to one side, lips cracked and split, but her eyes, those glassy, familiar eyes, locked onto mine.\n\nThe sacs I had passed earlier were connected to her. Dozens of them. Some pulsing. Some ruptured, leaking that viscous black fluid. One of the largest of these pseudo organs hung just beneath her ribcage, fanned open like cupped hands, something dark and wet pulsing inside.\n\nShe was not dead. She was not unconscious either. She was aware. Trapped in that endless moment, strung up and leaking into the walls.\n\nHer fingers twitched weakly against the wall. Tap, tap, tap. Not to escape. To warn me.\n\nShe had been trying to reach me. To pull me in. Or maybe to push something out.\n\nSomething shifted behind her, deep in the shadows. A low, wet groan crawled out from somewhere within the tunnel. The sound vibrated through the floor and into my teeth.\n\nI froze. She was not alone in here.\n\nAnd neither was I.\n\nFrom the folds in the fleshy walls, a shape emerged. Thin, low to the ground, its body gliding rather than walking. Its head jerked from side to side with insectile precision, sniffing the air with a wet, pulsing snout where a nose should have been.\n\nAnother shape followed. Then another.\n\nGlints caught in the beam of my headlamp. Eyes. Slits of light. Dozens of them. Crawling from every crack and fold in the tunnel. Some scuttled like spiders on too many legs. Others stretched tall, like skeletons stuffed into bags of leaking water.\n\nThey moved toward her. They moved toward me.\n\nI ran.\n\nFumbled the rifle onto my back. Nearly tripped over my own feet as I sprinted to her side. Her eyes followed me. Her mouth opened, cracked and bleeding, and a whisper rattled out.\n\n“End it… for the love of God.”\n\nI dropped the gas can trying to pull the rag free from my pocket. My hands were shaking so badly I almost dropped the matches too. I shoved the rag deep into the can’s mouth and struck a match against the box.\n\nThe flame caught immediately.\n\nThe creatures noticed. Their pace changed. No more slow stalking. They charged.\n\nI stepped back, tears cutting clean lines through the grime on my face. Her gaze stayed locked onto mine. There was no anger there. Only pleading.\n\n“I’m sorry,” I whispered.\n\nShe blinked slowly. One last time.\n\nI threw the can.\n\nIt hit the wall beneath her with a dull splash, soaking the area in gasoline. The burning rag hissed against the wet surface for half a second before the whole thing ignited with a low, heavy whump.\n\nThe heat punched the air out of my lungs. Fire raced up the fleshy walls, caught in the pulsing sacs, split them open like overripe fruit. Black fluid hissed and popped, fueling the fire higher.\n\nThe tunnel came alive with screams. The structure itself shrieked, a deep, wet howl that rattled through the walls and into my bones. The sacs along the corridor ruptured one after another, spraying black ichor into the fire, feeding the inferno. The light grew harsher, flickering madly across the uneven surfaces.\n\nShapes convulsed in the distance, writhing forms caught in the rising flames. Their bodies twisted and buckled, silhouettes melting against the burning walls. Some of the smaller creatures screeched and collapsed instantly, others tried to flee, gliding and crawling desperately along the fleshy floor toward me.\n\nI turned and ran.\n\nThe tunnel was tightening. Contracting like a throat. The walls pulsed and squeezed inward. The air grew heavier, hotter, choking. The static in my ears spiked until it felt like my skull would split open.\n\nMy headlamp flickered but held. I could see the rope, dangling in the shifting dark ahead, my last lifeline.\n\nThe creatures were behind me now. I could hear the slap of limbs against the burning, writhing floor. Fast. Faster than me.\n\nThe roar of the fire drowned out everything else. I reached the rope, hands slipping against the heat-slick nylon. I grabbed it, wrapping it around my wrist, and began hauling myself upward.\n\nBelow me, the world burned. I did not dare look back.\n\nMy boots slipped against the blood-slick surface. My wounded palm screamed in pain every time it gripped the rope. I climbed anyway, forcing my body upward, dragging myself away from the maw of fire and blackness that gaped below.\n\nThe portal was shrinking. The edges curled inward, burning themselves away.\n\nI felt the rope lurch once, sharply, as something heavy collided with the bottom. I did not stop. I climbed faster, hand over hand, heart hammering so hard it felt like it might explode.\n\nAt the last second, I heaved myself through the threshold.\n\nI landed hard on the bedroom floor, scraping my elbows and knees. Smoke billowed out of the collapsing portal, thick and choking. The runes on the walls sputtered, flickered, dimmed to dying embers.\n\nThe black mouth in the wall shrank smaller and smaller until it winked out completely, leaving behind a charred, cracked patch of drywall.\n\nThe remains of the creature caught in the wolf trap had started to dissolve, melting into a viscous black slurry that hissed as it spread across the floor. It smelled like burning oil and rotted fruit.\n\nThe only sounds now were the creak of the old house and the distant crackle of dying fire.\n\nI did not move.\n\nI lay there on the floor, covered in sweat, soot, and blood, staring up at the stained ceiling.\n\nI was alive.\n\nBut I had failed her.\n\nI had left her behind. Even though she had asked me to. Even though it was the only mercy left.\n\nI sat up slowly, every muscle trembling. The air was heavy with smoke and the bitter metallic stink of blood. I peeled the gauze from my palm and winced at the angry red gash underneath, already oozing through the wrappings. I pressed the bandage back down and forced myself to my feet.\n\nThe bedroom looked gutted. Scorched black fingerprints marred the walls. The floral comforter was coated in soot. The wood beneath the burned-out portal crackled faintly as it cooled.\n\nI stumbled downstairs. The living room was a mess of half-cleaned junk and overturned boxes. The front door hung ajar, letting the heavy morning fog seep inside in long, lazy tendrils. The sky outside was a flat, empty gray, the color of old bones.\n\nI leaned against the wall, my chest heaving.\n\nIt was over.\n\nI had destroyed the portal. I had burned whatever nightmare had taken root in this house. I had freed her, in the only way that was left.\n\nSo why did it feel like I had only peeled back the first layer of something deeper?\n\nI closed the door and bolted it, but the act felt hollow. There were no locks strong enough for what I had seen. No door thick enough. No prayers loud enough.\n\nI drifted through the house in a daze. Every corner, every piece of furniture seemed wrong now, corrupted by proximity. I spent my childhood here. Running my hands over these same walls. Watching cartoons on that same battered couch.

I planned on getting an hour of sleep before I started my work for the day. As I made my way back to the bed, my gaze fell upon the mushrooms, they were glowing now, brighter than ever. The pulsating bioluminescence reflected on the white walls of my bedroom. My heartbeat grew faster, almost syncing with the flowing glow. Faster, as the glow grew brighter.\n\nI went closer to the fungi, the glow now brighter than ever before. Illuminating the entire room with fluorescent green, blue and yellow lights. I saw that the stump had grown, not by a few millimeters in length, but grown large enough to sprawl out of the pot and on to the shelf, sticking to it like normally roots of a tree would, spreading out, as if ready for more growth. On this stump, grew more mushrooms. Big, round and glowing. Then, as if sensing my presence, all of them, at once, released the same, glowing spores out in the air.\n\nScores of glowing spores surrounded me at once. The air felt familiar now, hot, humid, putrid, just like in the dream. The smell of rot and decay engulfed me. Only now, I wasn’t bothered by it. It felt pleasant, relaxing, gratifying. The sweet aroma gave me a sense of tranquility I had never felt before. As if every muscle in my body was relaxed. My breathing became calmer, in sync with the bioluminescence. The peace I felt was otherworldly. I never wanted to snap out of the trance the mushrooms put me in. I don’t remember going back to bed.\n\nI don’t know when I woke up, but when I did, I had no urgency to go back to work. It was as if the world had slowed down for me. Everything seemed to be in slow motion. My instinct was intact enough for me to realize that this was wrong, that something was up. But it was like my mind had never known stress. Calmness had engulfed me. The sweet aroma emanating from the mushrooms was soothing every cell in my body. I yearned to go back into the dream world. A part of me had the urgency to open my laptop and start working, but the rest of me just wanted to sleep.\n\nI finally and reluctantly switched on my laptop. Browsed through the dozens of pending e-mails and opened tickets under my name, only to switch it back off and gaze at the magnificent fungi adorning my shelf. The spores still filled the air, like glowing dust across my room. They covered me, from head to toe. In the mirror, I saw the glowing version of myself, calm, at peace, as if every worry from the world had disappeared. I breathed in the fragrance and closed my eyes. I went to bed, hoping to go back to the dream world, that now, felt more like a home I always wanted.\n\nAnd indeed, soon I found myself back there. I realized that it was not the ground that was sticky, but the hyphae-like vegetative growth sprouting out of my feet trying to make its way underground. Soft, cotton like growth from my soles was trying to make its way into the wet, green, moldy ground. And with every step, I felt stronger, as if I derived nourishment from the ground.\n\nI observed the vast expanse of space above the giant mushroom trees. Glowing, fluorescent sky, nothing like the one back on earth. There were no stars, but the spores gave an impression of millions of illuminated celestial bodies floating around the horizon, as far as I could see.\n\nAs the growth from my feet spread, I felt myself slowing down, my own body entwining with the fibers already buried deep under the ground. Each time they touched, it was like a new thread stitching me to something larger, something vast. Then, the voices began—whispers layered upon whispers, countless, overlapping, impossible to follow.\n\nI strained to focus, but there were too many. Then, just as suddenly as they had come, the voices fell silent. A severing. A loss.\n\nAnd yet, I didn’t feel fear. The longer I stayed, the more I felt I belonged here. The strange calmness wrapped itself around me, deeper than before. It wasn’t just nature I was connecting with; it was something older, something that had long forgotten what it meant to be individual. The sweet aroma grew stronger, drowning my senses in a thick, soothing haze. I could feel them calling to me—not just to join them, but to *become* them. To be a part of the network. I felt. Included.\n\nI was annoyed when I woke up. My alarm had somehow managed to sever the fiber tethering me to the colony. I did not want to be back in this body. This mere sack of flesh, blood, bones and organs. A primitive mind, trapped behind eyes and mouth—tools for imitation, not true communion. The network here is fake and materialistic, behind a screen on a computer or a cell phone, where I can see pictures and read posts, but they are hollow for I cannot interpret the thoughts of those that post them. I don’t feel connected here. No one calls out to me here.\n\nThe spores surrounding my room immediately put me at ease, pulling me back into the trance I craved. The only thing left was the yearning to return to the colony. Work was insignificant now. Earth had become nothing more than a warehouse for my body, while my mind lived elsewhere - lived *with* them.\n\nThe stump had grown even further, sprawling across the shelf and spilling onto the floor. The mushrooms had multiplied—hundreds of them now sprouted from the thick, pulsing root. My walls, once bare and sterile, were now beautifully molding, giving my thriving colony a textured, organic backdrop. I could see the hyphae from each mushroom now, their fibers intertwining and stretching across the walls. Black mold bloomed around them, framing the latticework in a living, breathing masterpiece. It was perfect.\n\nIt was perfect, but I no longer wished to be there. The colony was my home and that’s where I longed to be. I took a deep breath of the sweet spore-nectar and drifted back to my stupor.\n\nBack home in the colony, the hyphae had now grown long enough to intertwine with the fibers existing beneath the moldy surface. They were woven together, holding me firm and immobile in my place. But at this point, movement was no longer needed. I was connected to the mycorrhizal network, the web. I was now not just a part of the colony; I was the colony.\n\nI could now hear them all—the countless whispers that once seemed chaotic now wove themselves into a single, coherent chorus. They were the voices of the Earthlings, hundreds, thousands of pilgrims like me who had found their way into this promised land. I could hear them reminiscing over their old lives, voices filled with gratitude for being freed from their mundane existence and insignificant worries. Each one gave thanks to the colony, to the great web, for consuming them, for giving them purpose beyond themselves.\n\nOn Earth, I woke up for one last time. A loud thud on my door had jolted me back into this vessel. The mushrooms had now consumed my house, growing over every surface, even over me. My body glowed with their bioluminescence, as if preparing to launch what remained of me into the greater web back home.  \nSoon, I thought. Soon, I will be home forever.  \nThrough the haze, I heard faint voices from the Earthlings outside:  \n“It’s been smelling like this for days, officer!”  \n“Police! Open up!”  \nI laughed, a rattling sound as the last air escaped my lungs. As my body slumped, empty at last, I left this alien planet behind. I had returned to the colony — the land of eternal peace."},"40":{"title":"A Man Watched Me Outside My Hotel Room.

Nothing fancy. Just clean, cheap, and close.\n\nThe lobby smelled faintly like old coffee and lemon-scented floor cleaner. The guy at the front desk barely looked up when I checked in. Just slid the keycard across the counter and muttered, \"Room 309. Elevator's to the left.\"\n\nThe elevator ride up was uneventful. No one else got in with me. When the doors slid open on the third floor, I immediately noticed how quiet it was. Too quiet. No distant TVs, no doors slamming, no muffled conversations. Just a long hallway with patterned carpet and yellowish lights buzzing faintly.\n\nMy room was at the far end. 309. Past all the other identical doors.\n\nAs I rolled my suitcase down the hall, I noticed something.\n\nAt the very end of the hallway, standing near the stairwell door, there was a man. He was facing me. Not moving. Not doing anything. Just standing there, watching.\n\nI slowed for a second, confused. Maybe he was waiting for someone. Maybe he was a guest locked out. I kept walking. Tried not to stare.\n\nAs I got closer to my door, I glanced back.\n\nThe man turned without a sound and slipped through the stairwell door. Gone.\n\nI shook it off. Told myself it was nothing. Maybe he did not want to make it awkward. Maybe he was embarrassed.\n\nInside the room, everything felt a little too still. The air smelled faintly of old detergent, like the carpets had been cleaned but not aired out. I noticed the desk chair was turned to face the window. Not where housekeeping usually leaves it. A small detail, but it stuck with me.\n\nI turned on the TV for background noise, tossed my bag onto the bed, and settled in.\n\nThe evening passed without anything else. I ordered delivery and ate on the bed, flipping through cable channels. Every now and then, I thought I heard faint footsteps in the hallway. Very soft. Not constant. Always stopping when I muted the TV to listen.\n\nAround 1:50 AM, the room phone rang.\n\nThe sharp, old-fashioned ring cut through the quiet like a knife. I sat up, startled.\n\nI answered.\n\n\"Hello\"\n\nStatic. A faint crackling sound.\n\n\"Hello\" I said again, louder.\n\nThere was breathing on the other end. Not a voice. Just steady, audible breathing.\n\nThen a click. Dead line.\n\nI hung up, staring at the phone. It could have been a prank. A crossed wire. Old phone system. Hotels are not exactly known for perfect maintenance.\n\nI laid back down, facing the door.\n\nMaybe twenty minutes later, there was a knock.\n\nThree slow, deliberate knocks.\n\nMeasured. Not frantic. Not playful.\n\nI sat up and listened. Another knock.\n\nI got up slowly, walked to the door, and looked through the peephole.\n\nThe hallway was empty.\n\nNo footsteps. No elevator ding. No stairwell door swinging shut.\n\nI stood there longer than I should have, holding my breath, waiting.\n\nNothing.\n\nI backed away and grabbed my cell. Called the front desk.\n\n\"Comfort Inn, front desk,\" the same man answered.\n\n\"Someone knocked on my door,\" I said quietly. \"And someone called my room.\"\n\n\"Room number\"\n\n\"309\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"Sir, external calls cannot be connected to guest rooms,\" he said. \"Only internal.\"\n\nAnother pause.\n\n\"Stay inside your room. I will send security up.\"\n\nAbout five minutes later, I heard the elevator ding faintly. Then slow, heavy footsteps coming down the hall.\n\nThere was a knock. Normal this time.\n\n\"Hotel security, sir\"\n\nI looked through the peephole. One staff member. Middle-aged guy. Black polo with the hotel logo. Radio on his hip.\n\nI opened the door with the chain still latched.\n\nHe asked if I wanted him to walk the hallway and check the floor. I said yes.\n\nHe disappeared down the hallway, moving slowly. Checking doors. Looking into the stairwell. He even checked the emergency exit at the far end.\n\nWhen he came back, he shook his head.\n\n\"No one out here now. Could be someone messing around,\" he said. \"Happens sometimes late at night.\"\n\n\"You should keep your deadbolt locked,\" he added.\n\n\"I have,\" I said.\n\nHe gave a short nod and walked back toward the elevator. I watched until the doors closed.\n\nI locked everything again and sat back down on the bed. I left the TV muted. I wanted to hear everything.\n\nAround 3:00 AM, I heard it again.\n\nThe door handle moving.\n\nSlow at first. Then a little firmer. Like someone trying to see if it was unlocked.\n\nI got up carefully and looked through the peephole.\n\nIt was covered. Like something was pressed against it from the other side.\n\nI backed away immediately. Heart pounding.\n\nI grabbed the nearest chair, jammed it under the door handle, and sprinted to the room phone. I called the front desk.\n\n\"Someone is at my door,\" I hissed. \"Trying to get in.\"\n\n\"Stay inside. We are sending security up right now,\" the man said.\n\nLess than two minutes later, I heard footsteps. A knock.\n\n\"Hotel security, sir\"\n\nI checked the peephole carefully. The cover was gone. The same staff member was outside.\n\nI opened the door with the chain still on.\n\n\"There was no one here when I got up,\" he said. \"No one in the hallway.\"\n\nI demanded they check the cameras.\n\nHe agreed and called the front desk on his radio. After a short wait, he came back.\n\n\"The feed is down,\" he said. \"Wiring issue. Cameras on this floor have been glitching. They are supposed to fix it tomorrow.\"\n\nI stared at him, not knowing what to say.\n\nI relocked everything, reinforced the chair, and sat on the bed, wide awake.\n\nAn hour passed. Around 4:00 AM, I realized I was not going to sleep.\n\nI decided to go downstairs to the lobby. Maybe just sit there until sunrise.\n\nI grabbed my room key, unlocked the door, and stepped into the hallway.\n\nIt was completely silent. Still.\n\nI started walking toward the elevators.\n\nAbout halfway there, I glanced down the opposite end of the hall.\n\nThe man was there.\n\nHead to toe in black.\n\nStanding perfectly still.\n\nWatching me.\n\nI froze.\n\nHe took one step forward.\n\nThen another.\n\nThen he broke into a full sprint straight toward me.\n\nAnd I [ran](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SafeScare\/)."},"41":{"title":"Always wash your face twice","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1ka3bxp\/always_wash_your_face_twice\/","flair":null,"author":"CallMeFiction","selftext":"I didn’t used to believe in weird rituals or superstitions.

Instead, I found myself back in the cemetery. Again, the dream took on a new form.\n\n*I am there, staring at the swelling black curtains, only inches away from me. After hours of agonizing fear I feel the invisible hand wrap around my throat once again. It squeezes tightly—my breathing turns desperate. Through choked breaths, I plead to be let go but the hand does not concede. My throat collapses all over again, slowly and dutifully submitting to the hand’s strength. I cough violently, feeling as though I will hack up my organs if it goes on for a moment longer. As I beg with half-formed words, the darkness becomes more alive than ever before.*\n\n*The buzzing sound grows tremendously loud; the noise, formerly indistinct, now takes shape. The vibrations of the hidden insects become a conduit for something much more human—humming the theme song of Little House on the Prairie. Nostalgia curdles in my stomach as the melody begins to drift subtly off-pitch, paired with an almost imperceptible increase of the tempo. Layered on top of the buzzing and humming, a voice forms from the dark, delivering jumbled phrases, as if a broken tape recorder is spitting out disjointed words—a cheap mimicry of human speech.*\n\n\n\n*“For eternity… I don’t want—want—want—want to leave, I don’t. I DON’T. NO, NO, NO–For eternity? Come in here, buddy—I, what? What? Turn it back on, please. I need it back.”*\n\n\n\n*The chopped-up mutterings come from a deep male voice—nearly indistinguishable from my father’s.*\n\n*The disembodied voice switches tone; I hear a female voice, far more coherently replicated than the previous imitation.*\n\n\n\n*“Hello? Joseph, can you please take a sho—oh! Sorry boys, I didn’t realize you were asleep—it’s early, but Angie misses you both, so get up…”*\n\n\n\n*Again I hear the stammering, staticky voice of my father.*\n\n\n\n*“She’s coming really soon—look up at the treeeeees, aren’t they soooooooooooooooooooo tall?”*\n\n\n\n*Synapses fire in recognition of that phrase. Where do I remember that from? The wretched voice continues to distort his words, half-howling while maintaining a sinisterly coy delivery. The words come to me as though invisible lips were pressing to my ear.*\n\n\n\n*“Look up… please—JJ, WHERE ARE YOUUUUUUUU? I WANT TO SEE YOUUUU? I’M UP IN MY BEDROOM, I MISSS— I… I miss you, I really do…”*\n\n\n\n*I hear his voice much more clearly, just before it returns to incoherent babbling. I lose track of it, swallowed whole by the raging storm of creatures waiting to pounce.*\n\n*I look up to the tops of the trees, swaying my broken neck. I stare in awe of their height until, suddenly, the curtains fall.*\n\n*A swarm of insects rushes forth. The air is now unbelievably humid, far more capable of ushering forth the putrid stench of rot–it’s so thick that I can taste it, almost as dew drops on my tongue. I try to shut my mouth, but–for the first time–I feel a second hand. Settling two fingertips on my face, one on either side of my jaw, it squeezes tighter and tighter. Suddenly it rips downward, dislocating my jaw with a sound that seemed closer to a crack of thunder.*\n\n*Now hung open, I could no longer fight the stench nor the insects. Feeling my throat fill with tiny, squirming bugs, I give in. After a near eternity, all sounds halt and I open my eyes to see a figure in front of me, slowly emerging as the insects disperse in every direction.*\n\n*In complete silence, like an old movie scene, I see the bugs, now filling the sky–my head bobs back. In a momentary glimpse I am only able to notice a pair of eyes, wide open and entirely unmoving—the plastic eyes of a doll, loosely nestled within deep sockets. As my limp neck bounces back, I stare down at the dirty and battered arms of suit jacket bridging the gap between the figure and myself. With one final tilt of my head, I see white liquid, foaming from between a pair of chapped lips—contorted into a smile. Shadows obscure nearly every other detail, but the figure seems to be ready.*\n\n*Before it can emerge I choke out one last cough, spewing a chunk of saliva-covered insects with it–entirely depleted of air, I black out.*\n\n*--*\n\nWhen I woke up I was relieved to feel that my throat was no more bruised than it had been the past few nights, though a horrendous, bitter taste overwhelmed it that I can only compare to arsenic nasal drip. I went to the sink to wash my mouth, then noticed that I could not hear the running water–the buzzing still rang in my ears. Gently, and without any inclination as to why I was doing it, I began to wrap my hands around my throat. The tender skin ached as I squeezed down; my subconscious unable to protect me from choking myself–I wasn’t even sure if I was the one moving my hands. The shower curtain in my childhood bathroom had been gone for years, replaced by a glass door, which was actually quite a relief to me as it got rid of that monster’s hiding spot.\n\nThen, I hear the window slide up, cautiously I guide my eyes over, the only thing I still have control of.\n\nThe face of the man from my nightmare cartoonishly pops through the window; its expression made of gleering eyes and a half-witted smile. My hands grow tighter around my neck–my trachea threatens to crumble at any moment.\n\nInvoluntarily I turn, only slightly, towards the window. Now, rather than being able to see it in the mirror, it is several feet to my back left, only slightly accessible in the corner of my vision. I fail entirely as I strain to turn my head and gain clear sight of the watchful eyes.  The image in the corner of my view is nothing more than a blur, but I can make out its grotesque movement as I stand, entirely still and suffocating to death. These thoughts feel relatively unimportant, though, as I see the creature slide down, through the window and out of sight. I can hear its suit buttons clatter against the floor tiles, growing closer.\n\nAfter so many run-ins with these impossible situations, I was capable of deciphering dreams from reality; unfortunately, I knew I was awake. Despite my every wish, I knew what was coming and prayed that my lack of genuine rest had sent me into a hallucination.\n\nIf I am able to move, my body would collapse in reaction to the next feeling; my back, muscles–tight in anticipation of the being behind me–become immediately flaccid as I felt a wet, scratchy face press timidly against my lower back. Patiently, it slides up my spine, careful not to come any closer than necessary, only letting the prickly hairs deliver a fluid onto my back–I’m forced to imagine it was pouring from between gritted teeth and an unbearable smile. When it reaches the top of my spine my tears begin to pour; its crusted lips brush against the nape of my neck, scratching as they find their way up to my ear. Upon arrival, the figure holds its mouth at such a distance so that the flaky skin would only tickle my earlobes. The lips part like a dam opening the floodgates–ushering forward a humid breath that dampens my cheek and earlobe. The breath carries forth an equally unpleasant smell, one I have come to know quite well. Even through my collapsing throat it is enough to make me wretch. I hear a shaky whisper–its trembling was a consequence of stifling laughter;\n\n*“Yooooooouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu…Don’t you get curious sometimes? Ever wonder how it felt for him?” Breathily, now, as if it were excited, “Try it, you know you want to…I’ve been trying to show you how good it feels. JJ, I think you’ll really, really like it…it was good enough for him to forget about you, wasn’t it? Rememberrrrrr, JJ. I’ll let you see my face if you–”*\n\nThe figure lets out several low, raspy, crackling coughs; immediately following this he begins to release a childlike giggle in my ear, the sound bubbles and screeches like an overflowing pot of boiling water as it grows more emphatic. The desperate, wheezing laughter begins to morph into the drone of millions of flies. They desperately pour from his throat, filling up the bathroom. As my vision becomes clouded, the bathroom shrinks into a few patches of light that will soon be filled by flies. As I hold onto the last bit of light my hands release slightly, now only barely aggravating my fuschia bruises. A wave of relief rushes over me, yet I remain unable to move my own body.\n\nPresumably in reaction to my new-found freedom, the monster’s hands begin to shift towards my stomach. As if imitating a spider’s jumpy movement, the monster taps its fingers like legs, crawling up the sides of my stomach, through my armpits, up my neck and under my ears–and then it reaches my face. \n\nThe fingers–with their horrid, unkempt nails and calloused skin–smell sickly-sweet. Rotten.\n\nThey linger against my cheeks for a moment before brushing away my tears. Comfortingly, the hands rustle my hair, then guided my head gently towards the mirror. I can only make out its hollowed, sunken doll eyes before I feel the hand begin to push the back of my head. \n\nWith a slow but incredibly assertive force the hand pushes my head towards the mirror. My forehead reaches it first, the hand now pressing forward with the patient, damning strength of a hydraulic press. The flies are so densely packed by now that they cushion my forehead’s contact against the mirror, but my fleshy pillow of insect bodies is quickly pulverized under the pressure, leaving behind an impressive amount of bodily fluid to drip down my face. As it continues to push me onward, the hand grips so tightly it feels as though my brain is swelling far beyond the capacity of its shell.\n\nI begin to shiver uncontrollably; the hand seems to suck the warmth from me. In the haze I started to feel the glass press into my skin, splintering under the pressure. Slowly, and with absolutely no hope to change the situation, I realize that this is where I will die. Cursed, likely from my birth, my hands have been bound to leave me defenseless against this monster–my legs have been forced to walk towards this inevitable fate. \n\nThe moments before my head shatters through the mirror and my throat splits open against the glass are agonizing–the splintering of the glass worsens dramatically with each second. The hand takes as long as it can to draw out my demise.\n\nTime drags as each crack in the glass finds its way into my skin, peeling apart my face and burrowing deeper. My eyes are next–splinters begin to scrape away at my eyelids, but the mirror is at its breaking point–I pray that I’ll be lucky enough to only suffer cuts on my eyelids before death. Instead, a number of broken shards slide from my brow, lubricated by my blood, and fall into the sockets. In an instant the barrier between the internals of my eye and the outside world is violated. It was a simple realization; a soft pop in each eye, and then the feeling of liquid rushing forth. \n\nWhen stabbed anywhere else one does not feel the absence of space–only the severe pain of the wound–but this is different. The searing pain seems to reach past my eyeballs, grinding against the bone of my eye sockets. Worse though, is the feeling of emptiness, maybe best compared to the acute awareness of the empty space left when a tooth falls out–one does not have to touch the area to realize there is a hole in their flesh, the feeling is constantly there. \n\n\n\n*And then, snap.*\n\n\n\nMy skull finds its way through the mirror–my neck is thrust into the shattered remains along the frame, almost entirely severed. It takes a moment for me to realize that I remain somehow, regrettably, alive. Upon having this realization I feel my hair yanked backwards. Then a familiar sensation arrives–my head flops sideways, as if only attached by a rubber band. Through the swarm of flies’ violent noise I hear its voice again, hissing:\n\n\n\n*“I just want you to have what you need, why not let go? Are you that much of a fucking pussy? You know you want to, so grow a pair, you waste of cum. Let. the. Fuck. go.”*\n\n\n\nSatisfied with its message, it disappeared, dropping me to the floor. My body became my own again and I, without hesitation, reached up to feel my eyes–they were still there, fully intact. At my side lay a shard of glass, draped in red. In the remains of the mirror–to my shock, it really was broken–I saw a skin-deep cut parallel to my hairline, with countless other gashes across my entire face. I grabbed the bloodied piece with my right hand, immediately flinching upon gripping it–carved into palm were cuts as well; perfectly, they matched the edges of the shard, a self-inflicted wound.\n\nA million thoughts rushed through my head; more than anything, I was eager to dismiss this as another of my hallucinations, or rather, a psychotic break. I would have had every reason to do so–no matter how real they feel, I have proven myself incredibly capable of weaving dreams and reality so effectively that I could never really differentiate, but I was bothered by an entirely different revelation. Fighting from the deep recesses of my mind, the thought occurred; did *it* really have to kill me with its own hands? Has it ever even tried? It was clear to me that there was something more–the loss of a parent is a tragedy, but how could it lead to *this*? There were two possibilities; either I was truly, irrevocably insane, or the beast of my dreams was fully capable of controlling my body, and was using it to lead me to my death. The former would explain everything, only failing on a few minor accounts; primarily, the origin of my madness. As a child I was troubled, but I moved on. And, not to forget, those markings on my throat–how could bruises from hands so giant be self-inflicted? \n\nI had to find out what “it” was and how it ever came to be. I could not have imagined how terrible the answer would be, even though the answers were so clear all along.\n\n\n\n*I denied it, I had to.*\n\n\\--\n\n  \nBefore I even realized what I was doing I had begun driving to the cemetery, this would be my first time back since that day that has plagued my life. My legs moved themselves, walking me down the same path that I had so many years ago. My hand felt the tightening grip of my mother’s; I heard the echoes of my baby sister’s cries and laughter; I stared at the many aged gravestones, although far more were now softened–nothing more than markers for long-forgotten loved ones who selfishly left the world behind.\n\nWhen I got to his plot, I didn’t even glance at his gravestone. Instead, I stared at that same coastal sky, obscured by what I had to believe were the exact same foreboding clouds. Maybe it was the fact that the scene was identical, but it was only now that I realized that exactly eighteen years had passed since the invisible hand began to beckon me into the gaps between the trees. In that moment, though, the pines looked far smaller than I remembered. Their curtains had fallen revealing a truth so obvious that I began to laugh–the woods simply went on.\n\n\n\nI thought; “Of course, I always knew that they were just woods, and that the trees were just trees. Somehow I had convinced myself that there had to be more, but there could never have been unbelievably dark curtains draped between the trees, or any unknown, desperate creatures, or a ridiculous invisible hand.”\n\n\n\nAnd for a brief moment I felt truly comforted in that belief, but then I wondered if it was even possible for my subconscious to have led me back here, on the same exact day; or for the weather to perfectly match my memory. Maybe I suffered psychosomatic symptoms as a child, but what about the blood on my head, or the buzzing that continued to echo in my ears. As I looked back towards the trees, I questioned if I had simply imagined them as being smaller–at the very same instant, they began to stretch towards the sky in front of me, and the woods beyond slowly dissipated into tangled, moving shadows. The sound of buzzing grew oppressively loud, and my breath became shallow.\n\n\n\nI cried out, “YOU’RE NOT REAL, YOU CAN’T BE. HE’S DEAD SO JUST LET ME GO–” but I stopped myself, overcome by the thought: \n\n\n\n*Why did my voice have to sound so much like his?*\n\n\n\nI thought back to the time without dreams, to the many years of calm, uninterrupted sleep. I wished desperately to return to that time. Unwittingly, I had begun squeezing my eyes shut so tightly it hurt. \n\n\n\nWhen I opened them I saw my fathers face–the same sunken, hollow expression that I had seen buried in his shadowy room–now dimly lit in the blackness below the trees. His eyes flickered up towards me, fighting to stay open. \n\n\n\nHe smiled. \n\n\n\nI smiled back.\n\n\n\nI asked him why he left; his face softened, now a look of loving concern.\n\n\n\nI heard his voice, gently assuring me,\n\n\n\n*“You already know why, don’t you? I love you, JJ, for eternity. Now please come closer, I want to see your face. I need to hold you.”*\n\n\n\nI begged him to leave the woods, to come to me.\n\nAbruptly, the figure jolted forward. His spindly arms preceded him–I watched as the stretched appendages jumped between physical states like two reels of film projected on top of one another. In one, its arms slowly coiled up and unfurled–snapping the bones and grinding them against each other. In the other, his forearms jutted to unfeasible angles, far beyond the limits of the elbows. The sound of bones cracking filled the air, but they were not simply breaking–they were adjusting themselves. \n\nBefore revealing anymore of itself, the entity decided on a form that was suitable; the splintered realities aligned as the arms snapped into place, now they hung limply at his sides, spindly and unwieldy. At the ends of its newly formed arms, fingers jittered back and forth on distended hands, entirely too large for even his body. His eyes, though… they were human. They were Dad’s.\n\n\n\n*“JJ?”* his shadowy smile grew larger.\n\n\n\n*“You look so handsome, just like your old man…”* his voice was cooing, warm. It carried the same raspy, calming inflection I knew so well–the voice I longed to hear again.\n\n\n\n*“Please… let me get a closer look, you know my eyes were never the best without my specs. I just–I really missed you.”*\n\n\n\nI couldn’t believe what I was seeing, “Dad? Dad, what is wrong with you? Are you okay? How are you even here?”\n\n\n\n*“What, you think I wouldn’t say goodbye? To my boy, my baby? You–you think I didn’t know I’d be here? I never really left, I couldn’t leave you behind. My boy… just come here, how many times do I have to ask?”* Uttering the last few words, his smile dimmed.\n\n\n\n“Daddy, I can’t–why can’t you just come closer? You aren’t acting right. I missed you, too–” my voice sounded so young, so frightened.\n\n\n\nThe first tear fell from my eye, stinging the cuts that covered my face. In the pain came memories of those impossible hands, the years of suffering they inflicted on me. For a brief, pathetic moment I believed him–in spite of everything, I wanted to. \n\n\n\nI drew back, and in exchange he took a step forward–seemingly aware of my new found distrust.\n\nI began to make out his face more clearly: a bubbling, white liquid dripped down his chin from a familiar smile, softening his scruffy five o’clock shadow. \n\n\n\n*“Do you remember how much I love you? Why don’t you just–JJ are you listening? Can you hear me? Can you just, please, listen to me for one goddamn second?”*\n\n\n\nI took another step back, and again, he came closer. My body reacted, my hands covering the bruised skin of my throat.\n\n\n\n*“I am telling you. You–LISTEN–you need to come here, right now.”*\n\n\n\nI revolted, his fingers were no longer twitching–they reached, curling and uncurling, as if feeling for something. As if waiting for a turn.\n\n\n\n*“I am DONE playing this game with you. I have waited, and waited, and–YOU KEPT ME AROUND, WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?”* As he barked at me, his voice began to falter–it would briefly slip into a register far deeper than my father’s, crackling from his hoarse throat.\n\n\n\nWhimpering, I released the few words I could muster, “Please, *please*–just leave me alone. For once in my life I want to sleep, I want to forget about you.”\n\n\n\n*“Oh booooohooo, how tragic. Why don’t you take a single second to think back? Was Daddy so special? He left you, you goddamn pansy. He didn’t give a single fuck about you, not enough to even leave you with a few words, you’re nothing, a nobody to everybody, but especially to your father. You don’t know a single thing about yourself or him, you’re still hiding from reality. If accepting the truth is so awful, why not just end your life? Is it really my job to make you accept that putting a stop to your miserable, pathetic existence is the only good thing you could ever do?”* \n\n\n\nHis eyes were glassy and unblinking, even as the insects from my dreams began pouring from behind his eyeballs in writhing droves. With them came the stench. It was thick, sour. Not rot–something far worse. \n\n\n\nMy stomach knotted, my vision blurred. What the hell was this smell? Why won’t it leave me alone for once in my life, for a single moment? I hated it, I fucking despised every moment of my life and I wanted to die, so why wouldn’t I? It gave me plenty of chances, it practically did the job for me–I hated that it was right. Yet I wanted to live, so badly–I must have. If I was really ready, wouldn’t I have walked to the woods? My twisted stomach began to boil–how many years could I handle wasting like this? Didn’t I deserve happiness too, or at least a goodbye? \n\n\n\n“DON’T YOU THINK I WANT TO DIE?” The words escaped me before I was even aware they were there.\n\n\n\nIt paused. Then let out a soft chuckle.\n\n\n\n*“Oh, sweetheart,”* it said wryly, “*That’s all I’ve ever wanted to hear*.”\n\n\n\nSomething deep inside me snapped. “WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE? IF I’M SO WORTHLESS, WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT EVEN I DON’T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOU?” \n\n\n\nI took a breath, “I… I don’t. I don’t need you. You’re not him and you could never be. Not even close.”\n\n\n\n*“A little touchy, huh? I want you to do something for me, if you don't mind. Try and remember what made him sooooooo great. You don’t miss your father, you fucking crave him. It's sick, you disgusting, shriveled fuck. I can still see it in your eyes, everytime you think of him you get so excited.”* He grinned, clearly pleased to see me react*. \"*He wouldn’t give a shit about a little-pricked fuck like you.”\n\n\n\nVomit began to fill my throat; what was this *thing*? Its desperate attempts to degrade me–to make me feel worthless–stung, only for the fact that they came from *his* mouth.\n\n\n\n*“Oh I’m just teasing, you fairy–and don’t think I don’t hear you in there–convincing yourself that it doesn’t bother you. I have heard your every thought for the past eighteen years. Do you even realize how constantly you think about him? You’re a broken record–either you let the fucking guy go, or you give up–he’s not coming back, and certainly not for you. Eighteen years, JJ–eighteen pointless years obsessing about a guy who didn’t think twice about you. Do you know why he didn’t leave you that letter? It wasn’t because you were unlucky, or because he wasn’t capable of loving you–your little obsession grossed him out, it made him resent you. Constantly begging for his attention–really, what else could he have felt? What kind of ten year old needs to sleep with Daddy every night? That is who you are, and who you will always be.”*\n\n\n\nI stood, paralyzed, unable to distinguish between my feelings and that thing’s. I had known for a long time that the only real thing Dad left with me was a hollow heart, his parting gift. It really would have made me happier to leave the world behind, to fly away.\n\n\n\n*“I–I can’t fucking stand it anymore and I know you can’t either–JJ, I SEE WHAT GOES ON IN THERE. EVERY FEAR. EVERY INSECURITY. THEY ARE ACKNOWLEDGMENTS OF THE TRUTH, SO STOP HIDING–FUCK–JUST FUCKING END IT BEFORE I–WHAT IS WROOOOONG WITH YOU?”* his voice no longer wavered; it had totally abandoned its imitation. It didn’t crackle–it screeched, desperately. Voices layered on top of voices, echoing and changing and crying:\n\n\n\n*“YOU–WE–Heyyyy bud, when did you come in? WHY ARE YOuu–DON’T YOU SMELLL IT, YOU GREEDY FUCK? THAT’S ALL THAT’S LEFT OF GOOOOOOOOD OLDDD DADDDYYYY–SHUT THE FUCK UP, YOU, YOU–”*\n\n\n\nThe voices collapsed into one–for a fleeting moment, I heard my mother,\n\n\n\n*“It’s fine if you want to stay here, my love–”*\n\n\n\nAnd then, its face lurched towards me, its neck stretching far across the graveyard. I came face to face with the monster. Its was contorted with anger;\n\n\n\n*“Do NOT think you can get away. You are a useless, self-obsessed, copycat who’s ‘Daddy’ hated him–that’s why he left, JJ, because he couldn’t stand you. Do your family a favor, make up for their loss by fucking. killing. yourself.”*\n\n\n\nI couldn’t hear another word. Bearing witness to this horrific figure in full for the first time, the memory of the smell began to pester at me. I pushed away these thoughts as quickly as they came, but they were unrelenting. \n\n\n\n*When did I smell it for the first time?*\n\n\n\nI saw *it* more clearly; beneath his disturbing facade was an unmistakable expression, a memory locked in the most unreachable part of my mind.\n\n\n\n*Why did I have to recognize his face so clearly, so many years later?*\n\n\n\nNo–the memory may have been suppressed, but it was not locked. I could never truly hold it at bay; the imagery proliferated in my subconscious at every turn. Refusing to accept the nature of what happened back then, I disguised it in every possible way, desperate for any reality that denied my own.\n\n\n\n“Wow, you think you figured it out, don’t you? Little JJ finally stopped living in denial–I’m so glad. Maybe this will finally push you over the edge… I’ll see you soon, freak.”\n\n\n\nI had no choice, not anymore. I remembered now.\n\n\\--\n\nEighteen years ago, in early spring, my mother brought my baby sister to our aunt’s house for a night. After I refused to go along, my mother went to talk to my Dad, but standing at the bottom of the stairs, I heard sigh deeply and calmly ask him something to no response. When she came back, eyes now watery, she patiently said;\n\n\n\n“It's fine if you want to stay here, my love, but please, if you need anything go next door, they have Auntie’s number. If I get a call I’ll come right home to–”\n\n\n\n“Why wouldn’t I just go to Dad?” I asked, interjecting.\n\n\n\n“JJ, your father needs more sleep than other people, let him rest for now, okay? I’ll be back soon.”\n\n\n\nI told her I wouldn’t need anything, and they left.\n\n\n\nIt didn’t take long for me to need something, though, maybe just a few hours. What I needed was something that neither my Mom or neighbors could ever give me; I needed Dad.\n\n\n\nI knocked on the bedroom door.\n\n\n\n“Dad… you promised me we could watch a scary movie next time it was just us two. Wake up,” I slammed open the door, giggling while I shouted, “WAKE UP! IT'S TOO EARLY FOR SLEEP!”\n\nAnd then I smelled the stench, one that has been stuck on the inside of my nose for my entire life. My brain could never truly forget it, although it tried so hard to. For eighteen years I convinced myself that this was the smell he *always* took up in his episodes, though I knew, I had to have known, somewhere deep down that I was lying to myself.\n\n\\--\n\n\n\nWhen I was ten and a half years old, I found him.\n\n\n\nI denied it then, tucked away from the world in the quiet of his room.\n\n\n\nI understand it, finally.\n\n\n\nHe did not just pass away, he *left* us.\n\n\n\nAnd I found him, although it took many years to realize what I had seen.\n\n\\--\n\nThere he was. The old wood-paneled television that my mother gifted him for their anniversary flickered against the dark. Its static made a piercing, ceaseless hum, filling the room. I called out, asking once, twice, “Dad, how can you sleep with that noise?” but he didn’t hear me.\n\n\n\nThe faint light of the television reached across the room, brushing his face with a shifting, electric glow. In the shadows, his cheeks looked hollow and his eyes sunken.\n\n\n\nBut they were open. His lips showed a gentle, melancholic smile.\n\n\n\nI figured the light from outside would do the trick, so I set out to open the curtains. For some reason, though, I couldn’t do it. I hadn’t realized, but my hands were shaking and I was weeping, unable to hear my own whimpers over the television’s buzzing, now growing impossibly loud in my ears.\n\n\n\nThe moments that followed are the most vivid in my memories now. I took a step back, and then another. I thought about “Pa” from Little House on the Prairie, Dad’s favorite character. We spent much of our time watching the show, pretending to be a part of the cast. I knew that from my acting experience that Pa wouldn’t be nearly as scared as I was. I thought about the smile on Dad’s face whenever I pretended to be Pa, and I lurched forward to open the curtains.\n\n\n\nThe light rushed into the room, but so did the flies who found their way in through a crack in the window, lured by the odor. I began to sob uncontrollably. Unable to turn around–to bear seeing something that I, at least subconsciously, knew was behind me–I kept on waiting to hear Dad’s voice. I reached my hand out slowly, turning the television off. Losing track of time, the same phrases ran through my head at an unbelievable pace; my subconscious was desperate to rationalize the situation and I had no intention of stopping it. Over and over, all I could think was: “He must be really sick to sleep like this.” Despite my false confidence, I couldn’t muster the bravery to turn around.\n\n\n\nI’m not sure how much time passed, but eventually I heard him wake up. \n\n\n\nI snapped my head around, thinking that his unintelligible noise meant we could go to the movies, or at least eat dinner. He coughed, or rather, *choked*. Despite the awful noise he emitted, his wet, hacking cough didn’t seem to be that bad–his body was almost entirely unflinching. And then he coughed again, this time I noticed another oddity; his eyes weren’t closing as he coughed. I saw something at the corner of his lips. Another moment passed, and a final cough. With it came a rush of white substance; his mouth was foaming up with some liquid that I found revolting and confusing.\n\n\n\nQuickly I jumped up next to him, wailing, I begged:\n\n\n\n“Daddy, please wake up! Look, you got sick on yourself. Please wake up–please. I-I can help you clean up.”\n\n\n\nUsing my sleeve I got the foaming liquid off his mouth and cheeks. I distinctly remember being so fearful when it came out of him, yet when I went to wipe it up there was no hesitation. In fact, I was suddenly calm. My eyes began to well up again but this time the tears fell upon a gentle, hesitant smile. It felt nice to help him, I guess.\n\n\n\nThe light faded as I laid next to him, going back and forth between begging him to wake up through sobs and silently, wordlessly, asking him to hold me. This went on for hours, until my throat became hoarse and my body was exhausted. I tucked my back against his scrawny chest, sinking into the bed with him. The moment I pulled his arm around me my body decided it couldn’t sustain me for another moment–for the last time, I fell asleep in Dad’s embrace. \n\n\n\nWhen I woke up, I first noticed the sun peaking out over the treetops. I realized how warm it felt. Almost immediately afterwards, my notice of Dad’s icy skin interrupted any pleasant delusions. Sitting up, I looked over to his bedside table, and saw several bottles of sleeping pills. Next to them sat an envelope. Inscribed, in his favorite pen, were the words;\n\n*To JJ, my pride, my future, and my best friend. I love you, and I will for eternity. If I ever go, please stay here.*\n\n*--*\n\nWhen I was ten and a half years old, my father laid in his bed, took as many pills as he could swallow, and passed away.\n\n\n\nWhen my mother found us wrapped up in bed it actually took her a moment to realize. She had been, understandably, put off by the smell but then again, some things are just too horrific to accept–I know that more than anyone. Her brain, even just for that brief moment, had to deny the implication of me, curled up in his arms; especially to avoid confronting the fact that it wouldn’t have happened if she were home. Unknowingly, her eyes avoided looking into the face of my father; in fact, they were entirely closed as she smiled at what appeared to be an affectionate embrace.\n\n\\--\n\nEighteen years later, I stood under a cloudy sky in a cemetery in Maine–hallucinating visions of the last night I spent with him; the creature that he became. Shifting my vision towards his grave, I think I can now see what he meant in his poem to Angie. My fingers ran across the aging words:\n\n*“In our youth we fly…*\n\n*I have come to much prefer the nest.”*\n\nDad was not able to live a normal life, not as a child or a young man, not even when his heart had been “filled.” Despite preferring the nest, the bird flew into the sun. Here, hand resting upon this lovely stone, I wondered how good the flight must have felt.\n\n\\--\n\nThe fall breeze traversed the folds of my pajamas, forcing itself against my most vulnerable points.  In response, my brain began to conjure the words of my favorite work in Dad’s collection of poetry. It was untitled and had been written urgently on an unfolded pregnancy test package with an expiration date in the year of my birth. His penmanship was different, too–there was a suggestion of excitement in the bouncy lettering;\n\n*She twirled the fresh curls in her finger,* \n\n*flashing a toothy grin as the waitress circled with a fresh pot of bitter “Colombian” coffee.*\n\n\n\n*Her smile lingered.*\n\n*On each tooth I saw a different reality,*\n\n*One with magical spells,* \n\n*or one where humans were roughly 15 feet tall…*\n\n*In one we were Adam and Eve,*\n\n*and in another there was only one difference; I had an extra toe.*\n\n*Some had alien invasions, dictatorships, or whatever else I could imagine.*\n\n\n\n*Only one thing was always there; all of our potential worlds revealed an image of two Moons above our heads.*\n\n*I would stretch my neck to stare up at them,*\n\n*whirling and circling each other in the most beautiful dance.*\n\n*Each basking in the other’s glow.*\n\n\n\n*I looked up into her eyes and saw the same beautiful Moons.*\n\n*I asked her;*\n\n*“Do you know how the Moon came to be?”*\n\n\n\n*I never got an answer, she just kept on smiling*\n\n  \n\n\nThe tragedy of the Moon, a broken fragment of the Earth that it longs to rejoin, began to overwhelm my thoughts as I suffered through the wind’s penetrating, bitter gnawing against my skin. I wondered how he wrote so much of my life story, our life story, in just a few lines of a poem. A life spent floating in his orbit had prevented me from ever becoming more than a memento of his legacy–a body made from a chunk of his own, unable to ever even replicate his image. It has come time to break my orbit, for our waltz to change.\n\nRight now, I bet his wings are begging to rest as he heads into the Sun. His whole life he searched for its warmth, always too far to reach.\n\nWhile he travels, hoping only to be embraced by that celestial body, I will still be waiting here, remembering his fading heat as I fell asleep on our last night together. I hope you find it, Dad. Maybe, for the first time, the warmth that escaped from your skin your whole life will be replenished.\n\n\\--\n\nUncertain what to do now, I laid down next to his grave, hoping that at the very least my body heat would reach him through the dirt. As the wind raged, harder and harder, I somehow felt entirely comfortable. I began to feel as if my body was sinking into the ground, and as my eyes gently shut, I began to dream.\n\n\n\n*I open my eyes to see the Earth, plunged in a dark void–the unending blackness only interrupted by countless stars in the backdrop. My hands raise involuntarily, reaching out in front of me. I examine them as they desperately grasp towards the Earth.* \n\n\n\n*These hands are not mine, I think, they’re far too small. Inquisitively, I look at the body I’m attached to–it’s no different.* \n\n\n\n*A smile grows across my face as I realize I’m wearing my favorite t-shirt, a gift from my Dad. In bold font, the words “Redwood National Park” hover above a print of the tallest trees in the world. He bought it for me on a trip we took together shortly after my parents found out they were having another child. My eyes take in the ground below; somehow I’m on the Moon.*\n\n\n\n*I blink–when I open my eyes I’m on the Earth, now looking back at where I just stood. My hands begin to wave; first at the Moon, and then at a lonesome bird overhead.*\n\n\n\nMy hand continued to wave until I felt someone grab my shoulder, shaking me. Looking back, I saw my mother, crying. I could feel the nurturing heat from the Sun soaking into my skin; softly, my eyes opened as I left behind my first new dream since childhood.\n\n\n\n“Hi..” I muttered, still dazed. I realized I was crying.\n\n\n\n“I saw what happened in the bathroom… come home, please.”\n\n\n\nI cast a glance toward the tree line. Through my teary eyes, I couldn’t tell if the figure that still stood there was real.\n\n\n\nI once again see her facial expressions from that first visit to the cemetery–the rage, the hurt, the loneliness–and I now remember the look she gave me when I read the quote in my father’s voice–she was terrified. I wondered if she had ever planned to give me that letter, only to decide against it when she realized why my likeness to my father scared him so much. Unfortunately for all of us, I found Angie’s first and kept it hidden, driving myself into the belief that I was the only one forgotten.\n\n\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that the words I have been searching for are sealed inside that dusty envelope. Maybe I’ll read it one day–I’m sure Mom will give it to me if I ask–but today, I think my memories are enough to tell me all that I need.\n\n\\--\n\nDad… I forgive you, so please, go to that warmth that you need. Keep searching higher and higher, far away from here. You deserve to find whatever it was that was taken from you, fill your heart up as much as you can.\n\n\n\nPart of me will always be here, sealed away– a child, terrified by the pines, hearing the static of your old television, falling asleep in your limp arms. Today, as I stood six feet above you but millions of miles away, I realized I don’t mind that so much. Honestly, I just wish you could see the sun emerging from the clouds above Mom and me. As it does, the light cascades between the trees, revealing the deep, unexplored woods–they have always been there waiting for me. Those dark, impenetrable curtains are finally wide open, and the Sun is shining so brightly. I can still see the imitation of you, its twisted face barely peeking at me from behind a tree. I wonder how long it will be before it beckons me back into the dark.\n\n\n\n"},"43":{"title":"Someone Left Notes for Me in My New House","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k9zoh3\/someone_left_notes_for_me_in_my_new_house\/","flair":null,"author":"Naruto_fanverse","selftext":"Part 1: The First Note\n\nI’ve never posted anything like this before, but after everything that happened, I can’t keep it to myself anymore.\nMaybe writing it down will help me make sense of it.\nMaybe it’ll just make it worse. I don’t know.\n\nAbout four months ago, I moved into a small rental house just outside town. It wasn’t anything fancy — two bedrooms, old carpet, leaky faucet — but it was cheap and I needed a fresh start.\nThe landlord barely said two words during the walkthrough.\nHe handed me the keys, told me to \"stay out of the attic,\" and left.\n\nI didn’t think much of it at the time.\n\nThe first few weeks were uneventful. I worked during the day, unpacked at night, and slowly made the place feel like home.\nIt was... lonely, sure.\nThe neighbors kept to themselves.\nSometimes I felt like I was the only person on the whole street.\n\nAbout three weeks in, I found the first note.\n\nIt was a Sunday afternoon. I was rearranging the kitchen cabinets, trying to figure out a better place for my coffee mugs.\nWhen I pulled out a dusty stack of paper plates left by the previous tenant, something fluttered out and landed on the counter.\n\nA piece of yellow lined paper, folded twice.\n\nNo envelope.

I worked through college so I could move out of my parents' place soon after graduating. The place itself is nice - it's got a pool, hot tub, even a tiny attic for storage. It’s a 10 minute drive from my work, and it’s walking distance from the gym I go to. It’s the perfect little set up for someone just starting their adult life, like me. \n\nI am not an outgoing person. When I lived in my parents' neighborhood, I knew none of the neighbors. I kept to myself, and I had every intention of continuing this habit. In fact, the only exception to this was the middle aged lady who lived immediately next to me, Jane. Our yards have small fences and we often greet each other when leaving or coming back home. But it’s only ever a friendly “Hey.” Besides that, I don’t put my nose where it doesn’t belong. \n\nI work very long shifts, and I get home very late - around midnight, sometimes later. My routine is to make dinner, shower, and go straight to bed, if my eyes can stay open for even that long. But on the very first day in the apartment, my precious sleep was interrupted.\n\nCrack. The unmistakable sound of a can opening. In my defense, it was nearly 3 a.m., and I was exhausted. It sounded close - close enough to see from my window. I checked, and found that I was right.\n\nBefore I explain any further, you’ll need context as to the apartment complex I live in. It’s a row of 2 story buildings, with units on both sides of each building. I live on the first row, right on the street. My bedroom is on the 2nd story and is on the back of the building. My window overlooks the fence of the building behind me, giving me a perfect view of the ground floor unit’s porch. There are plants and shrubs behind the fence, seemingly to provide some more privacy, but my view is above those, too.\n\nSitting on the porch was an old man with a Coors Light in one hand and a cigarette in the other. I wanted to shout at him. If he was going to indulge in his vices so early in the morning, he could at least do so with some consideration for others. \n\nRegardless, he stayed relatively quiet after this, and I was able to get some rest. \n\nThe next night, I was woken up at an even more egregious hour by the sound of coughing.\n\nCoughing doesn’t even feel like the right word for it. It was more like hacking. Violent, deep, guttural noises followed obscene hocking and spitting. \n\nOutraged, I went to my window and immediately located the sound. It was the old man again. He was standing, one hand on the back of a chair, the other over his mouth, doubled over and coughing with his whole being. My anger turned to pity and shame. \n\nHearing how he coughed, this man could very well have some type of disease or condition, and here I was selfishly condemning him. As I listened to him mumble to himself, I made a new resolve. I would break my chain of solitary living and introduce myself to my neighbor. Even if it was only once.\n\nThe next day, as I passed by Jane in our morning ritualistic greeting, I decided I would ask about the man. She told me his name is Leonard and that he had lived there a long time. She told me he lived a sad life - a widower forgotten by his children. This flushed out any semblance of doubt left in me. I would befriend this man whether he liked it or not\nAs we spoke, I noticed the faint murmur of a voice coming from the open upstairs window of her unit - quiet, almost whispering. I assumed she must have had guests and kept the conversation short, not wanting to intrude.\nAdmittedly, I was slightly nervous. I put together somewhat of a gift basket consisting of things I thought he may appreciate. Mostly snacks from nearby stores. I waited for the weekend and, gifts in hand, marched over to his front door. \n\nHe was very slow to answer. I stood waiting for almost 5 full minutes. Within those minutes, I heard strange noises. Thud, drag, thud, drag - moving somewhere on the upper floor. And wheezing, too. Not like before, but like someone with holes in their lungs was trying their best to breathe. A painful pattern of inhales and exhales punctuated by a terrible squeaking from within someone's body.\n\nJust as I was about to leave the gifts on the ground and go home, the door swung open. The first thing that struck me was the smell.\n\nDeath. \n\nIt was so strong that my eyes watered. I had to stop myself from gagging to preserve any type of manners in front of my neighbor. \n\nHe now stood before me, clad in a dirty, faded red t-shirt and stained, baggy, grey sweatpants. He looked like he hadn’t showered in days. When he spoke, his breath was somehow able to overpower the smell of rot from his apartment. It was like curdled milk.\n\nHe spoke gruffly, slurring his words,\n\n“What?”\n\nHe took up most of the doorway, but I could see a portion of his living room. Flies buzzed incessantly over something behind his couch. His carpet was flecked with large brown stains. His TV must have been on somewhere out of sight - the sound of distant muttering fluttered like a ghost through the air.\n\nHe noticed me staring. I know he did. I flashed him my best attempt at a smile, holding up my offering to him,\n\n“Hi, I’m Stan. I moved in not too long ago. I thought I’d introduce myself. These are for you.”\n\nHe plucked the basket from my hand and dug through it, tossing everything to the ground one by one, as if he was looking for something specific. When all but the pack of beer remained, he looked up and gave me an equally gruff, \n\n“Thanks,” \n\nI was sure this time. He sounded drunk.\n\nHe shut the door on me and most of the things I had purchased for him, which were now scattered on the faded brown welcome mat. I was shocked. I had over thought this so much that I had planned for every scenario. All but this one. My mission had been a complete failure. \n\nHonestly I was relieved. I took it as fate telling me to stay in my lane and mind my own business, as I always had. Something I was all too happy to do.\n\nBut it also meant I was right back at square one. \n\nThat Sunday night, I was again woken by the same ungodly hacking. I went to shut my window when something caught my eye - something different.\n\nMy neighbor wasn’t doubled over like usual. There was no tension in his body. He was standing half-hidden in the bushes by his fence, as if trying - and failing - to conceal himself. His mouth barely moved, yet the same violent, guttural coughing rattled from his throat, perfectly mimicking the sounds I had heard so many nights before.\n\nHe was staring straight up at my window. Staring into my eyes from his hiding spot.\n\nI don’t know why this flooded me with panic. I felt like a rabbit who had just been spotted by a hawk. I ducked down immediately, and the coughing stopped in the same instant. When I peeked my head up again, the porch was vacant. I shut my window and checked the locks -just in case. Paranoia, maybe. But it helped me sleep.\n\nThe next week was peaceful, not a sound from my night-owl neighbor. I started to think that he may be on a trip or something. I do have a habit of jinxing myself, because the very night I began to hope that my sleeping troubles were at an end, I was woken by another noise.\n\nNot the crack of a beer can, not coughing or wheezing, but popping. Sickly and wet, the sound sent chills through my body before I even saw their origin. I peeked through my blinds, careful not to make too much motion in case he was watching me again. If only.\n\nMy neighbor was on the floor, laying on his back with glossy eyes. He was almost dead still- the only movement from him came when the man eating him ripped another chunk from out of his thigh. \n\nAnother pop. The sound of bone being ripped from sinew and socket. The figure looming over my neighbor had chewed enough off of him to pop his entire leg from his hip. He proceeded to gnaw at the meat like a carnival turkey leg. I gagged - a mistake I curse myself for.\n\nAs soon as I made a noise, the man looked up directly into my eyes - still hidden from behind my shutters. \n\nI understand I sound like a lunatic. I know that it’s not something anyone would ever believe. But the man eating my neighbor was my neighbor. On the floor, he lay pale from blood loss, partially eaten, in a pool of black blood. And on top of him was the very same man, now smiling at me with chunks of his own flesh still wedged in between his yellow teeth. I almost instinctively grabbed my phone from the nightstand by my bed and dialed 911.\n\nSeemingly in response, he jumped over his porch fence with agility not befitting his age and sprinted towards my front door. I raced him down the stairs. I was confident I had locked the door, but I needed to be sure. I stopped in my tracks before I reached it.\n\nJane had her face pressed against my sliding, glass back door. Like Leonard, her chest and hands were drenched in blood. She smiled at me the same way he did, and knocked almost politely on my door. \n\nI ran back upstairs and locked myself in my bedroom. The operator had already assured me that several officers were on the way, despite my incoherent rambling, but that did little to calm me. I wanted to vomit, to faint, to be anywhere but here. \n\nI keep a knife by my bed, which I retrieved and clung to as the banging on my front and back doors intensified. Then a hellish choir of coughing filled the air - coming from both sides of my home. It sounded like a recording of Leonard's cough, but as if it were coming from all around. It filled my ears until my vision spun. It was deafening.\n\nAt last, I could hear sirens approaching - cutting through the cacophony of coughing. After a few more minutes, the police arrived at my door. I didn’t open it for them and I’m sure me holding a knife at them as they kicked my bedroom door down did my reputation with the law no favors. \n\nThey carted me off to the station, where I explained everything to them. They told me there was no one there. Jane and Leonard’s apartments were empty. Spotless. Scrubbed clean. And no one was by my front or back doors. There was no evidence of anything happening, this or any night. More than that, aside from documentation, there was apparently no evidence in the 2 apartments that Jane or Leonard had ever lived there.\n\nIt's been a few months since then. The apartments next to and across from me are, to my and the police’s knowledge, vacant. \n\nMy secluded lifestyle has only gotten more drastic. Nothing makes me feel better. That feeling of prey being stalked never leaves me. Every polite smile I get nearly sends me into a panic attack. I never know if it’s real anymore. They all smile the same - too wide, too still, like they’re waiting to be recognized.\n\nI’m suspicious of everyone. I know they’re still out there. Jane and Leonard. And who knows how many others are like them. \n\nMy online friends recommend therapy, but I refuse to trust some stranger. I barely trust my own friends anymore.\n\nRegardless, I try to do things to keep my mind off of it. Exercise, work, even some art classes at the community college. Anything to distract me. \n\nIn fact, I only decided to post this because, just now, I heard a noise from my attic. It’s around midnight now.\n\nIt was faint. Almost polite.\n\nThud, drag. Thud, drag."},"45":{"title":"I Check the Weather Obsessively","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k9uaso\/i_check_the_weather_obsessively\/","flair":null,"author":"Gold_Firefighter_448","selftext":"The sun was just beginning to set beyond the mountains which encircle my hometown when a Spring rainstorm popped up. I hadn't expected rain. The forecast had been showing clear skies all day long. It started as nothing more than a drizzle, and quickly became a deluge before subsiding back to a drizzle. \n\n\nAs the downpour waxed and waned all around, I was disturbed to hear a sound which was not borne of nature. It was the sound of somebody trying my back door's handle. The torrential rain slowed long enough to hear a slow, low, disappointed voice say \"...cked up tight.\" I felt panicked. Somebody was trying to get into my house. \n\n\nI was allowed only a second to grapple with this realization before I was wrenched back into the present by the sound of thunder slamming itself against my side door. The knob attempted to turn uselessly against its locked mechanism. The voice came again, this time sounding devastated. As if encountering a locked door while trying to gain entry to my home were one of fate's cruel tricks. \"Locked up nice and proper.\" My heart skipped a beat at the sound, and it skipped another when I turned to look at my front door. Unlocked. \n\n\nI ran for the door. I doubt that I've ever moved that fast before, and I'm sure I could never do it again. I slammed against my wooden savior in haste, the lock sliding in with a \"clunk\" immediately answered by a thunderous impact which shook the frame of the door if not the whole house. Picking myself up from where I lay, several feet away from the door I saw that it had remained intact. Even the glass portion in the middle of the door was unmarred by the titanic force which slammed against it. \n\n\nI began to process what I was seeing beyond the glass. The thing which had been trying to enter my house had its face pressed up against the transparent barrier. It was a putrid mass of writhing flesh. Hundreds, if not thousands of tiny tentacles comprised the bulk of the \"face\". It had the eyes of a snake. Its tentacles moved in perfect synchronization to reveal a mouth filled with row after row of way too many teeth. Its teeth were round and dark in color. Like stones worn smooth by a river. It spoke again, this time consumed by animal rage. \"ALL LOCKSY UPSY GOOD GOOD GOOD.\" \n\n\nAfter its outburst the creature took to silently leering at me with only enough of its head exposed to allow its eyes to see me. We stayed like that for a while. The thing leering at me with cold fury in its eyes. Me staring back with cold piss in my pants. Eventually the rain subsided and that devil disappeared from my doorstep. I had thought that would be the end of it. \n \n\nFour months had gone by, and I was beginning to approach the idea of letting go of the horrific experience I'd had. It had been almost an hour since I had last checked the weather, and I was thinking of going for two. That's when I saw the announcement of a \"pop-up storm\" for my area. All of my doors had been staying locked for months, and thay day was no different. The thing made its rounds, growing in volume corresponding with its rage. When it had checked all of my doors and found its efforts frustrated, it took to leering at me just as before.  \n\n\nIt's been seven years since then. I'm a morning person by necessity, that's when I do all my shopping, gardening, working, and general \"outside\" stuff. I check my weather app every fifteen minutes. These are precautions I've taken as I don't know how it all works. I don't know what would happen if I were away from home when a surprise storm rolled in. I don't know what this thing even is. I do know one thing though. After seven years of maximum effort attempts, the thing now only bothers, half-heartedly, to check the front door. Finding no success, it sighs, and goes to sulk in a corner. After seven years, it's giving up.

Hell, I barely believe it—and I was there.\n\nI’ve been cave diving for most of my adult life. It’s one of those things that either terrifies you or makes you feel alive in a way nothing else can. Crawling through lightless, half-flooded tunnels of stone with barely enough room to breathe… it rewires your brain. You stop thinking in straight lines. The world becomes narrow and endless all at once.\n\nLast weekend, I drove four hours out to a site I’d been meaning to explore for years. It wasn’t on any official maps—just a whisper passed around in old diving forums. A collapsed sinkhole out in the woods, hidden behind a rusted chain-link fence so twisted with vines you’d miss it if you weren’t looking.\n\nThey said the cave beneath it was “alive.”\n\nI figured they were just being dramatic.\n\nI geared up alone. No spotter, no lifeline. Stupid, I know. But the site was so remote that dragging another person out there would’ve raised too many questions. I didn’t want anyone else staking a claim.\n\nThe entrance was a narrow shaft, just wide enough for me to wriggle through with my tank scraping the sides. The temperature dropped the second I slipped below the surface, the rock slick with something that smelled faintly metallic.\n\nIt felt like the earth swallowed me.\n\nFor the first hour, everything went as expected—tight squeezes, shallow water pooling in strange, veined patterns on the floor. My flashlight cut thin white beams into the blackness, carving out tunnels only a few feet at a time.\n\nThen I found the passage.\n\nIt wasn’t like the others.\n\nThe stone around it looked wrong—almost porous, like coral or old bone. When I ran my glove over it, the surface felt soft. Almost… pliant. I should’ve turned back then. Every instinct in my body screamed at me to turn back.\n\nBut curiosity won out.\n\nI pushed through.\n\nThe tunnel narrowed and dipped sharply down, forcing me into a crawling descent. The walls pressed so tight against me I could feel my own heartbeat vibrating in the stone. I kept telling myself it was just rock. Just empty space.\n\nThat was before the breathing started.\n\nIt wasn’t mine. It wasn’t human.\n\nIt was deep, wet, and rattling—like something with too many lungs, struggling to pull air through a thousand crooked throats. The sound echoed through the tunnel ahead, growing louder the deeper I went.\n\nI should’ve backed out. I should’ve scrambled for daylight, no matter how tight the space got.\n\nInstead, I crawled toward it.\n\nThe tunnel opened into a wider chamber after what felt like hours. My flashlight beam shivered across the walls—and that’s when I saw it.\n\nThe walls weren’t rock.\n\nThey were made of flesh.\n\nPale, rippling tissue that stretched across the ceiling and floors, pulsing with a slow, sluggish rhythm. Veins as thick as my arms throbbed beneath the surface, branching out like the roots of some impossibly huge tree.\n\nAnd in the center of the room… something moved.\n\nAt first, I thought it was a pool of water. It shimmered and shifted like liquid. But then it began to rise, pulling itself upward in long, stringy strands, forming a rough, heaving shape. No eyes. No mouth. Just a roiling mass of translucent, worm-like tendrils that groped blindly at the air.\n\nAnd it smelled—a wet, rotting stink that clung to my skin, soaked into my suit.\n\nI was frozen. Completely paralyzed. My body knew something my mind hadn’t caught up to yet:\n\nIt wasn’t just living tissue.\n\nThe whole cave was alive.\n\nAnd it was waking up.\n\nI tried to back away.\n\nSlow. Quiet. No sudden movements.\nThe thing in the center was still assembling itself, its tendrils weaving together in twitching, nauseating patterns. I figured if I was careful enough—if I didn’t make a sound—I could slip back through the tunnel before it noticed me.\n\nI turned, crouching low, moving one hand at a time toward the way I came.\n\nThe light from my flashlight jittered across the walls, making the veins in the flesh-pitted stone look like they were writhing. I fought to keep my breathing steady. Fought to ignore the way the walls seemed to tighten with every inch I crawled.\n\nThen my foot slipped.\n\nJust a little.\n\nJust enough for the heel of my boot to scrape against the wet surface—and that tiny sound, that tiny scritch, was enough.\n\nThe creature stopped moving.\n\nIt froze mid-assembly, tendrils stiffening like a marionette pulled taut on invisible strings.\nA low, wet clicking sound echoed through the chamber, vibrating through the stone—and the walls responded.\n\nVeins bulged. Flesh shuddered.\nThe entire cave seemed to lurch forward in one slow, slithering motion, like a body trying to force itself through its own skin.\n\nPanic took over. I abandoned any idea of stealth and lunged for the tunnel mouth, my hands clawing at the slick walls, my knees scraping raw against the stone-flesh. I half-crawled, half-swum into the narrow passage, my flashlight bouncing wildly and plunging the tunnel into jerking shadows.\n\nBehind me, the breathing grew louder. Faster. Hungrier.\n\nSomething heavy slithered after me, wet tendrils slapping against the stone with a sickening, rapid rhythm. The tunnel was too tight to turn around. I couldn’t see it—but I could feel it, the vibrations rattling through my bones.\n\nI kept scrambling, dirt and mucus-slick stone filling my gloves, my gear catching on the narrowing walls. Every second counted.\n\nThen the tunnel shifted.\n\nI don’t mean it branched off—I mean it moved.\nThe stone-flesh around me flexed, like a throat constricting. The opening I had come through twisted sideways, folding into itself. The way back was gone.\n\nI crashed into the dead end, my helmet striking the wall with a sharp, hollow thunk. Pain spiked down my neck.\n\nI whipped around, trying to shine my light behind me.\n\nAnd I saw it.\n\nThe thing had almost filled the passage. It wasn’t chasing me with legs or arms—it was dragging itself forward on a hundred writhing filaments, each one tipped with tiny, grasping claws.\n\nAnd it was smiling.\n\nNot with a mouth—there was no face—but the ripples across its form shaped a crude, mocking grin.\n\nIt didn’t just want to kill me.\n\nIt wanted me alive.\n\nThe walls pulsed again, tightening, the fleshy stone squeezing inward like a hand about to crush a bug.\n\nMy flashlight flickered once—then died.\n\nAnd in the pitch black, the breathing closed in.\n\nI forced myself to move.\n\nOne hand at a time, fumbling across the rippling, mucous-slick floor, desperate to find anything I could use. A loose rock. A broken shard of old equipment. Anything.\n\nMy fingers brushed against something hard.\nSomething… sharp.\n\nI didn’t even think. I grabbed it, the edge slicing into my glove and nicking the skin underneath. Pain flared in my hand, sharp and grounding—good. It meant I was still alive. Still fighting.\n\nI jammed the shard into the wall.\n\nThe fleshy stone screamed.\n\nIt wasn’t a sound—more like a vibration, a high-frequency pulse that rattled my teeth and made my nose bleed instantly. The “wall” writhed under the impact, veins spasming and pulling away from the wound like worms recoiling from salt.\n\nI stabbed again. And again.\n\nEach hit tore more of the pulsing tissue apart, revealing layers underneath: slick, twitching muscle, then wet bone, then something that looked like a vast network of tangled nerves.\n\nThe whole tunnel shook.\n\nFrom behind me, I heard the thing shriek—a gurgling, chittering noise like thousands of tiny mouths tearing open at once.\n\nIt was coming faster now. No more slow, deliberate dragging. It knew what I was doing. It knew I was hurting it.\n\nI dug the shard in deeper, carving a rough hole through the wall. My hands were slick with blood—mine or the cave’s, I couldn’t tell. The air tasted metallic and foul, thick with rot and something sharp like burnt hair.\n\nThe hole widened just enough to see a faint glimmer of light beyond it—cold, bluish light. Not daylight. Something else.\n\nBut it was an exit.\n\nOr at least, not this.\n\nI shoved my body into the gap, feeling the fleshy membrane tear around me, sticky strands clinging to my suit. The cave tried to pull me back—veins snaking around my legs, tendrils lashing at my arms—but I fought harder, kicking, tearing, screaming into the pitch-black air.\n\nFor one terrible moment, I felt hands—not tendrils—hands—grabbing at my ankles. Thin, brittle fingers with too many joints, clawing, pleading.\n\nI didn’t look back.\n\nI tore myself free, half-falling, half-crawling through the ragged hole—into the unknown light beyond.\n\nI hit the ground hard on the other side, sliding across slick stone. My flashlight, miraculously still strapped to my wrist, sputtered back to life with a weak, shivering beam.\n\nAnd I saw where I was.\n\nNot another chamber.\n\nNot freedom.\n\nA nest.\n\nHundreds—maybe thousands—of those same fleshy tendril-creatures, all slumped in tangled heaps along the walls, sleeping. Shuddering softly in rhythm with the breathing pulse of the cave.\n\nThey hadn’t seen me.\n\nNot yet.\n\nBut one of them—the closest one—twitched.\n\nAnd slowly, slowly, began to stir.\n\nI stayed frozen, barely breathing.\n\nThe creature closest to me slumped back down, its twitching subsiding into slow, wet convulsions. Around it, the others continued their rhythmic pulsing, a grotesque mimicry of sleep.\n\nI had to move.\n\nAs I edged along the wall, my flashlight’s weak beam swept across the stone—and I saw it.\n\nMarkings.\n\nDeep grooves, almost invisible against the pulsing flesh-stone, spiraled across the surface like scars. Arrows. Symbols. A path, carved by someone before me.\n\nI followed the markings with my eyes, tracing them to a darker corner of the cavern.\n\nThen I saw it.\n\nThe massive thing at the center of the nest.\n\nIt wasn’t like the others.\nIt was huge. Rooted into the floor by thick cords of veined flesh. Its skin stretched taut over a skeleton too angular, too wrong. Its “head” was a mass of writhing tendrils, shaping crude impressions of faces—grinning, weeping, screaming.\n\nIt wasn’t breathing.\n\nIt was dreaming.\n\nAnd the whole nest pulsed in rhythm with its dreams.\n\nIf it woke, all of them would.\n\nI edged toward the carvings, my every step a fight against my own shaking body.\n\nHalfway across, the tendrils along the ceiling shivered.\n\nThe massive creature twitched.\n\nThe nest stirred.\n\nI stumbled the last few feet to the far wall, found a fissure hidden behind the markings, and squeezed through just as the nest exploded into motion.\n\nTendrils lashed. Bodies screamed. The massive thing in the center began to unfold.\n\nI forced myself upward through the narrow stone shaft, kicking at grasping fingers, clawing at slick stone, until—\n\nI burst into the open.\n\nCollapsed onto cold, wet grass.\n\nThe sinkhole behind me was silent.\nThe sky above was purple with dawn.\nThe breathing was gone.\n\nFor now.\n\n⸻\n\nI don’t know how long I lay there.\n\nEventually, I staggered back to my truck and drove. I didn’t look back.\n\nI haven’t gone near that place since.\n\nBut sometimes—late at night, when the world is quiet and I can’t sleep—I swear I can still feel the breathing.\nSoft at first. Like the pulse of a distant tide.\n\nGetting closer.\n\nI moved last month. Packed up everything. Left the state.\n\nIt didn’t help.\n\nTwo nights ago, I found something on my living room floor.\nA wet, pale thread, about the length of my finger.\nStill twitching.\n\nAnd last night, when I pressed my ear to the wall—\nI didn’t hear the sounds of the city.\n\nI heard the stone breathing.\n\nAnd this time, it wasn’t just calling my name.\n\nIt was whispering how to find me."},"47":{"title":"Every day, I meet the Grey Man at the bus stop","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1ka0e75\/every_day_i_meet_the_grey_man_at_the_bus_stop\/","flair":null,"author":"GOBI_501","selftext":"Every day I meet the Grey Man at the bus stop.

I have\r\ngrown accustomed to his presence. At least I had. Never once did I think that I relied on him to\r\nbe standing beside me as I waited in the limbo before my inevitable departure. Never once did I\r\nthink that his absence would lead to the worst experience of my life.\n\r\nIt was one, rather gloomy, September morning, when I left for the bus stop. Something felt\r\nwrong. The bus stop was two blocks down the street, but I already knew, not in my mind, but in\r\nmy heart, that today I would not be seeing the Grey Man.\n\r\nThe fog was thicker than normal. It was almost impossible to see even three feet in front of me.\r\nThe sky had turned to a deep crimson as if the black clouds had bled out, poisoning the blue\r\nethereal waters and everything inside of them. The harsh, but distant, rumble of thunder\r\nthreatened rain upon the cold earth. All of the plants seemed to wilt and sprout thorns. Every\r\ntree that I passed looked like a devilish hand scorched bark, reaching up towards the tainted\r\nheavens. All of the leaves, weather on the trees or the ground, had seemed to wither overnight,\r\nbecoming Grey, ashy, husks. I tried to not pay attention to these things. I tried to focus on\r\ngetting to the bus stop. I had to confirm that my suspicions were true.\n\r\nAs I approached the intersection, the emptiness of the area set in. For the first time, the Grey\r\nMan was gone. I was struck with an immediate sense of dread as I crossed the street to the bus\r\nstop. My veins filled with the urge to run away. Every part of me, of my soul, just wanted to be\r\nback home, but I knew that I couldn’t leave.\n\r\nI sat down on the bench to find that it was completely rotten. Falling through the seat, I was\r\nexposed to the sight of large pink larva, squirming about within the wood. They clustered on\r\nchunks of decayed wood. Slimy translucent film strung them together in a web of pulsating\r\nparasites.\n\nOne of the larval creatures burst from its cluster, extending towards my face to reveal that,\r\nbehind the layers of goopy raw flesh it had a face, the face of a doll. White with childlike\r\nproportions, the larva’s face was contrasted by two deep voids of sockets, hidden behind its\r\nfluttering eyelids. Its mouth opened to release a dark ichor down onto the others.\n\r\nI reeled back in absolute disgust, crawling backwards across the dark, decaying grass. I tried to\r\nmake sense of what was happening. I tried to rationalize the situation. It was no use. I could find\r\nno answers to my questions.\n\r\nThe stench of rot had breached my nostrils. It was too strong to keep down. I felt the fluid rise in\r\nmy esophagus. I proceeded to vomit up that same dark inky secretion into the dead grass. It\r\nmelted and merged with the plants to create a hot tar puddle.\n\r\nStanding up, I realized that I was shaking. I was shaking violently. I looked up towards the sky,\r\nveiled by the swirling fog and dark accumulations. Almost on queue, a flash of lightning and\r\nsubsequent thunder signaled the rain to start. The sky, as well, was not free from the dark ichor.\r\nIt poured down from the charcoal clouds, flooding the grass, and spreading the reach of the\r\nmolten tar.\n\r\nI tried to run, but my feet were stuck in the boiling black mucilage, forcing me to fall over into the\r\nring of nightshade where the Grey Man once stood. I stared at the flowers on the poisonous\r\nplants. Flowing ichor dripped from their petals as they began to die. I slowly crawled my way\r\nthrough the grass, my hands and legs sticking with every movement. I managed to reach out\r\nand grab the curb, which I used to pull myself out of the tar.\n\r\nI was lying in the street. The dark, heavy rain was coming down even harder, creating syrupy\r\npools on the asphalt. By that point, my muscles had started locking up. I watched as my hands\r\nturned to a sickly white color. I began to cough up more ichor as I lay there, curled up and\r\nshivering.\n\r\nI’m not sure how long I layed there before they appeared. It felt like days. Eventually I saw them.\r\nThey were large grotesque creatures. They shared the porcelain face of the larva, but seemed\r\nmore human in form. Four long wasp-like wings sprouted from their lumpy backs. They only had\r\ntwo long arms that ended in hands that looked like slimy tree roots. Their abdomens all ended in\r\nan ugly point from which more roots grew.\n\r\nThey appeared in a circle around me, their wings beating in slow motion as they hovered slowly\r\ncloser. As the circle constricted the things began to screech in an incomprehensible language.\r\nMy ears were ringing. My head began to spin. I felt like I was bleeding from every orifice on my\r\nbody. They closed in. The world got dark. I had never wanted to die more in my life.\n\r\nThe creatures fled when the lights came. Piercing through the foggy black rain, were the two\r\nunmistakable beams of headlights. At that moment, I only hoped that the vehicle would put meout of my misery. I saw no other way out of that hell than to become human roadkill, but the\r\nvehicle had different plans. It stopped just short of where I lay on the ground, clearing the fog\r\naround it. The bus had finally arrived.\n\r\nWhen I climbed onto the bus, the world seemed to lighten up. The driver gave me a look of\r\nconcern as I sat down in a seat. Looking out the window, the sky was its normal grey and the\r\nfoliage was looking rather green. I found myself soaked in nothing but water. The bus departed\r\ndown the street. I had made it out of hell.\n\r\nThe following morning, everything was back to normal. Light fog crept over the sidewalk, but\r\nnever dared to obscure my vision. I made it to the bus stop, where the Grey Man was standing\r\nin his circle of nightshade. I went and sat down on the bench next to him. The bench was now\r\nstiff, as if recently replaced with new wood. I sat for a moment before I spoke.\n\r\n“Where did you go yesterday?” I said, my voice starting to shake as I remembered the events of the\r\nprevious day.\n\r\n“Why weren’t you here?” Tears were starting to form in the corners of my eyes. I stared at the\r\nGrey Man for what felt like forever before he turned his faceless head towards mine.\n\r\n“I apologize for my absence. There was something I had to tend to.”\n\r\nHis words were soothing in a way I did not think possible from such an ominous entity. I felt\r\ncalmed by his recognition of my pain. He managed to convey all emotion at once without any\r\nexpression. He turned back to face the distance.\n\r\nWe haven't spoken since. I don’t even want to. His presence is enough to keep me feeling safe.\r\nTo this day, he still meets me at the stop before I head off to work. I silently thank him as I step\r\nonto the bus. I'm not sure what he is, I don't care to know, but I am eternally grateful that he\r\ndecided to stand on that corner."},"48":{"title":"My Brother Went Missing Last Year After Exploring a Local Condemned House.

It’s a bad place. Something hungry lies dormant within, waiting to latch onto everything it possibly can and wear it's victims like a costume.\n\n \n\n“So, what, it’s haunted or something?” Dylan asked as he rifled through my glove box, looking for something to entertain himself with.\n\n“That’s what I’m assuming. If what William wrote about was true.”\n\n“Okay, but didn’t he go missing last year? You couldn’t possibly be thinking—.”\n\n“He’s my older brother, Dylan. I can’t just put the fact that he might still be alive behind me.”\n\nMy older brother went missing last year, at least, that’s what everyone thinks happened. I had overheard him talking about exploring the condemned house near the edge of our town. Whether it was with friends or telling mom and dad about how cool he thought it was, I was well aware of what he thought of it. I could have stopped him.\n\nWhen he left, he was quiet about doing so. I only woke up to the sound of him closing the window as he jumped from the second floor into our yard. I should’ve called for him, but I didn’t want to get him in trouble.\n\nThat night was the last time I ever saw William alive, but it wasn’t the last I heard from him. The next day, he left me a letter. The contents of which, have brought me to where I am today. I transcribed this before following in Will’s footsteps. This is my brother’s story. This is how he went missing.\n\n \n\n“To, Rick.\n\nSorry to say goodbye like this, but I’m out of options. I’m not going to be around anymore, but you don’t need to worry about that. I’m writing this so you don’t end up making the same mistake I did. When you read this, tell mom and dad that I ran away, it’ll be easier for them to think that I did. It’s just— I can’t get it out of my head. I have to satisfy my curiosity, Rick. I’m sorry you have to find out like this, but when you finish reading, you’ll understand. Just, don’t be mad at me.”\n\n \n\nMom and dad are heavy sleepers, so I figured I’d be able to get out of the house without much of a challenge. Richie, on the other hand, is a light sleeper. I’m going to have to be quick if I want to leave without him noticing. My bedroom window leads to the sloped part of our roof, so I can get to the ground below without hurting myself.\n\nBackpack, flashlight, notepad, camera, I had everything I needed. By the time I was ready to go, it was 4:46 AM. Dad was going to get up soon to get ready for work, I had to move quickly. Gripping the bottom part of my window, I eased it up as to not make any unnecessary noise.\n\nBy the time it was halfway open, I heard shuffling from the room to my right. Shit, Richie was awake, what was I going to do? I quickly finished opening the window and exited my home. Turning around, I quickly shut the window and dropped to the ground below without anybody noticing.\n\n It was winter, so it wouldn’t be light out for another couple hours. I got in my car and started it. Pulling out of the driveway, I wondered if what I was doing was worth it. Was whatever could have been in this house worth potentially leaving my family? I quickly pushed that thought to the back of my head and brought the house back to the front of it.\n\n22 XXXXX Drive (not going to get it out of me that easily, little brother.) I punched the address into my phone and pressed on. Landon, one of my friends, had gone to the house a couple months earlier. Strangely, he made it out just fine.\n\nHe even recommended that I go to it and check it out for myself. I attempted to ask him to come with me, but he never responded. Okay, I lied a little bit. This trip wasn’t just to satiate my own curiosity; I was going to this house because I wanted to find my friend.\n\nBy the time I had begun to mentally prepare myself for what was about to happen, I was already in the driveway of the large, imposing house. I grabbed everything I brought from the passenger seat and left my vehicle. Two stories, and it looks like nobody has lived here since it was created.\n\nI took a couple deep breaths and then pressed on. Grabbing the door handle, I figured it was going to be locked. To my surprise, the knob came out of the door in my hand, and it creaked open inwards. Sweet, didn’t have to look for a way in.\n\nI passed the threshold and looked around, turning my flashlight on. Cobwebs clung to the ceilings and corners of the house and dust coated nearly every surface my light shined on. It smelled old and musty.\n\nI did a quick walkthrough of the first floor and determined that there were 4 total rooms downstairs. A living room, a dining room, a kitchen, and a bathroom. On the side of the staircase was a door leading down to the basement.\n\nThis was what everyone talked about, but it was going to have to wait. There was nothing interesting in any of the downstairs rooms. There wasn't really anything interesting except for the kitchen.\n\nI opened up the refrigerator and found the dusty, crumbling remains of whatever last meal the residents of this house ate. I had to shut the door when I saw the worms wiggling out of the pot.\n\nTurning around, I went over to the dining table. Three plates set for dinner. Three plates with the same food I found in the fridge on them. Three forks. I went to leave but had to do a double take. I whipped back around and found I was right.\n\nThere was a mummified *finger* wrapped around one of the forks.\n\n“What the hell?” The words danced in my head. I didn’t want to speak for the fear of alerting anyone else who might be in the house with me, but I was surely shaken now. I took out my camera and snapped a photo of the fingered fork. When I went to leave this time, I actually went through with it. Time to head upstairs.\n\nI knew the house was old, and so I knew that the stairs would creak when I stepped on them, but they didn’t. That should have been my first sign to leave. The stairs being in good condition meant somebody took care of them. The only thing on my mind at the time was an answer as to the whereabouts of my friend, all rational thoughts pushed to the back.\n\nI reached the second floor and did another quick scan of it. Four rooms again. Three bedrooms and a bathroom. Having seen what was downstairs, I was a little hesitant to explore the rooms this time. My fears were quickly suppressed by the feeling that I wouldn’t find what I wanted if I didn’t go any further.\n\nThe first bedroom was easy to get into because the door was out of the frame, and I couldn’t find it anywhere else. Creeping in, I looked around with my flashlight.\n\nNothing of real interest popped up, but I did find a pair of socks on the pillow of the bed. I started to feel sick. Looking closer, I could see that the socks were about the size of ones that would belong to a child.\n\nSnapping the photo, I turned around to leave when I heard it.\n\n*Somebody was downstairs.*\n\nI stopped dead in my tracks. Could—could they hear me? They were still moving around so they couldn’t have stopped to listen to me.\n\nI didn’t want to take my chances downstairs, so I crept back out into the hallway. Maybe I could hide in one of the rooms with a door. I crouch-sprinted over to the second bedroom and grasped the knob. I got up and turned it. *Unlocked*. Okay, now to just get in. I opened the door slowly and nearly screamed.\n\nAs the hinges of the door screeched, whoever was downstairs stopped. They knew I was up here now. Knowing I didn’t have to be careful anymore, I rushed into the room and slammed the door. By the time I had done so, they were upstairs.\n\nMy eyes darted around the room looking for anything I could use to block the door. They landed on a chair next to the bed. I almost fell over trying to get to it but didn’t. I picked up the chair and slammed it under the door knob at the same time whoever was upstairs with me slammed into the door. I was safe, and they couldn’t get in.\n\nI backed up and slid down the wall into a sitting position. Either it was going to get in, or I was going to wait it out. I figured I could use the time to look over my photos. I scanned the picture of the fingered fork and noticed something. Zooming in and enhancing the image, I noticed something. I nearly dropped the camera when it hit me.\n\nIt was *Landon’s* finger.\n\nWhen we were younger, he had messed around with one of his dad’s power tools and sliced the tip of his index finger off. It was able to be reattached but left a scar on his *right* index finger. That same scar was on the finger wrapped around the fork.\n\nI’m not sure what scared me more; the fact that it was my friend’s finger on the utensil, or the fact that he had all ten fingers when he told me about this place. Before I could gather my thoughts, a voice rang out from behind the door.\n\n“Hey… let me in.” It—it was Landon’s voice. Why was he doing this?\n\n“How do I know it’s you?!” I yelled, desperation quickly overtaking me. I didn’t know if he could hear the fear in my voice, but I could certainly feel it in my body.\n\n“I’m your friend, of course it’s me.” The voice was flat. Zero cadence, like a robot was trying to mimic him.\n\n“I’m—what’s something only you AND I would know?” I had to throw something out. I needed him to say something about the scar. I spoke again, correcting myself.\n\n“N—no, wait. What finger is your scar on?”\n\n“……” I didn’t like that. I needed him to answer me.\n\n“Landon. *What. Finger. Is. It. On?*” Regardless of the answer, I knew I wasn’t going to like it. The severed finger downstairs told me that much.\n\n“……” He doesn’t know. He doesn’t know what scar the finger is on. *That’s not Landon*.\n\nAs if to solidify my realization, whatever was on the other side of the door slid something under it. I knew what it was. I didn’t need to look down to see, but I did anyways. Between my feet, was the *real* Landon’s severed finger. Before I could do anything else, I heard heavy footsteps as whatever was on the other side of the door ran downstairs.\n\nAfter waiting for about 15 minutes, I decided it had to be safe enough to venture back out into the house. I crept downstairs and bolted for the front door.\n\nThere was a wardrobe in front of the door frame. I gave it my all, but it wouldn’t budge. I was stuck in here. I heard footsteps from the kitchen. It would take too long to go back upstairs, so I went to the only place I hadn’t yet explored.\n\n*The basement*.\n\nOpening the door, I crept in and closed it behind me. I turned on my light and ran down the stairs. This room must have been sealed off, because it smelled like *death*. I reached the base of the stairs and looked around. I had to stifle a scream and cover my mouth to stop myself from puking. There were dozens of corpses down here. No blood, no entrails and no insides.\n\nI went up to one of them and it looked almost as though the corpse was withered. Not old, but like something had sucked the life out of it. What the fuck happened here?\n\nI—I wasn’t the first person to come down here. As I heard the basement door close, I finally realized that I was *not* going to be the last person to do so either. I went to the opposite end of the basement. I know what happened to my friend now. That wasn't really him who told me to come here.\n\n*Landon’s withered corpse was leaning against the wall, his mouth agape. Four fingers on his right hand.*\n\nIt’s him. As the footsteps behind me grow louder, only one thought goes through my head; “it’s really him.” I turned around and shined the flashlight on the thing wearing Landon’s skin. It raised its five fingered, scarred left hand and smacked my flashlight, destroying it and breaking my wrist in the process.\n\nI fell to my knees and screamed out in pain. The thing walked up to me and put its hand on my head. Everything went black.\n\nI woke up outside of the house, the sun shining on me. I sat upright and wheezed. My whole chest hurt, as well as my mouth and throat. It felt almost as though something crawled inside me. I got up and decided my next move. A force was drawing me back to the house, and I couldn’t resist it for long.\n\nI trudged back home. It took *hours*. It was a school day as well as a workday, so by the time I made it back, I was the only one home, *good*.\n\nI stumbled up to my room, the pain in my chest was nearly unbearable. I began writing a letter. A letter that would explain everything. I had to lie to mom and dad, if only to protect them. I could tell Richie though, he’d get it. Ugh, it’s getting worse now. I need to leave soon.\n\nRich, I’m leaving this on your pillow, you’ll find it. When you do, don’t come after me. I made this choice, so I have to deal with it. By the time you read this, whatever killed and impersonated Landon is likely to have done the same to me.\n\nTell mom and dad that I just ran away, that I got sick of living here. But also tell them that I love them. And uh, I love you too little brother. I need to go now, while I still have at least a *little* bit of control. Don’t come back for me.\n\nFrom what I could read, there was a little splatter of blood on the corner, but there was nothing else besides that. After reading it and coming to my own conclusion, I knew what I had to do.\n\nI had to *find* my brother.\n\n[ Part Two](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kas1yv\/my_brother_went_missing_last_year_after_exploring\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n "},"49":{"title":"I saw something terrifying in the fire - Update","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k9mge4\/i_saw_something_terrifying_in_the_fire_update\/","flair":"Series","author":"Mr_Outlaw_","selftext":"Context: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k5r2hi\/i\\_went\\_to\\_a\\_rave\\_in\\_an\\_abandoned\\_factory\\_it\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k5r2hi\/i_went_to_a_rave_in_an_abandoned_factory_it\/)\n\nWhen I arrived at the psychiatrist’s office, I checked in at the front desk. The woman working there told me to take a seat, that the main guy was just finishing up with another appointment.\n\nNow I’d never seen a psychiatrist before or been in one of their offices. But I wasn’t terribly impressed with this one. It was like the opposite of inviting. The entire place looked old and somewhat decrepit. Weird stains on the walls, floors that looked like they hadn’t been swept in months. There was also the faint smell of something burning. Not sure what exactly, but definitely not food. The only other person in there with me was an older lady sitting in the corner, reading a magazine.\n\nThere was also a TV anchored right above reception. It looked pretty new. Flat-screen, maybe fifty inches. Didn’t quite match the aesthetic of everything else.\n\nI started watching it but couldn’t understand what it was supposed to be. Looked like somebody filming themselves walking through a residential street. Like one of these city walk videos you can find on YouTube. Except this wasn’t somewhere interesting like Tokyo or Shanghai. Just some suburbs somewhere in America.\n\nSomewhere strikingly and uncomfortably familiar.\n\nEventually the camera stopped in front of a house, staying on it until I could feel a sinking in my gut.\n\nI recognized the place. It was my childhood home. A memory clear as day.\n\nWe’d moved several states over when I was about eight years old. We moved because the house had burned down while we’d been away on vacation in Florida. Left the stove on, is what my father had told me. I never really bothered looking into it. Instead of going home, we moved into my uncle’s place for a few months while my folks figured everything out and found us a new place.\n\nI continued watching as the camera panned down to a gloved hand holding a container of gasoline at which point I looked away and then down at the floor.\n\nThis could not be happening. There was no way. Of course I knew that I needed to get the hell out of there, but an esoteric kind of fear was keeping me glued to the seat. The kind of fear you’d have as a kid when you were getting ready to go upstairs at night. That once you started moving, something would start chasing you from behind.\n\nI looked back up at reception, making sure to ignore the scenes on the television. The girl looked busy, typing away on the computer. Then I looked at the lady in the corner again and noticed that she wasn’t moving. Like at all.\n\nIt was a statue. A human-like prop. Made of what, I couldn’t be sure. But it was starting to melt in the sunlight.\n\nI looked back over at the receptionist and now she was looking at me, her hand covering her mouth as if the sight of me was one of the funniest things she’d ever seen. On the television now was my old bedroom completely engulfed in flames. There was a figure sitting on my burning bed, their back turned to the camera. After a while they began to turn slowly around and that’s when I jumped out of the seat and ran away.\n\nMy mind’s racing as I walk home and I’m looking over my shoulder every few seconds. Now the fear has evolved into some overwhelming dread, and I get this sense that I’m being followed even though the streets are packed and there’s no way to confirm that.\n\nA few minutes later I get a call from Jack.\n\n“Where are you right now?” he asks me.  \n\n“Just out and about. Why?”\n\n“So you’re not home?”\n\n“No. Why?”\n\n“Don’t go home. Meet me at the Starbucks near my place. I’ll explain.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Absolutely do not go home.”\n\nGiven everything that’s happened, I took his advice and went over to the Starbucks. When I got there, he was already sitting at a table waiting for me, two lattes in front of him. It looked like he hadn’t slept in days.\n\nI sat down across from him, and he looked at me and sighed and slid me one of the cups.\n\n“I don’t how to begin to explain this to you,” he said. “It’s fucked up. It’s gonna be a lot to digest.”\n\nI told him that I was pretty much willing to believe anything at this point.\n\nHe went on to explain a bizarre incident he was involved with several years back. His station had received a report about intense, rancid smells coming from a condo in a suburban neighbourhood near the edge of the city.\n\nGiven the details, it seemed like a cut and dry case. Somebody was murdered and a body was dumped somewhere the killer had deemed inconspicuous. Apparently these things happen a lot.\n\nSo he goes over there to investigate with Clayton, his partner at the time.\n\nWhen they showed up, they were surprised to find that the place had been extremely well-maintained. Freshly mowed lawn, immaculate paint, the works. Which wholly contradicted the claims that it had been abandoned for years. However, none of the neighbours were able to remember the last time they’d seen anybody actually entering or leaving the place.\n\nHe told me that the moment they got out of their car, their senses were assaulted by this overwhelming stench. But not the kind they’d been expecting. Not at all like decomposing flesh. It was more esoteric than that. Like something burning. But they couldn’t tell what exactly.\n\nSo they start making their way to the front door and the closer they get to it, the more they feel compelled to turn and sprint the hell away. A strange kind of feeling. As if some invisible force was trying to tell them that this place was not meant for them, that they needed to steer clear.\n\nThe energy oozing from this place was awful. Sinister. Enough to make two hardened officers question everything that had led them to the moment.\n\nJack went to knock on the door but saw it was already partially open. They entered and their eyes immediately began to water. The air was boiling inside, and the smell had become outright oppressive, so heavy around them it almost felt like they were moving underwater.\n\nIt was also dark. Abnormally so. Light was streaming in from the windows only to be completely suffocated after a few inches. Even their flashlights were being drowned in the gloom, hardly able to provide enough light to effectively navigate. It almost felt like they had entered another dimension.\n\nAt some point Jack nearly tripped over something. A small notebook, he realized after picking it up. Like one of those micro journals. He put in his back pocket and continued on.\n\nMoving further into the place, they could start to hear something. Like a low, muffled rhythm. After a while they could tell that it was some sort of chanting. But it didn’t really make sense. It sounded too far away, as if it were happening several floors below them. But it also could’ve been a recording. Which too would’ve raised some frightening implications.\n\nSoon they found themselves standing in front of a door presumably leading to the basement. Here they could hear the chanting the clearest, though they still couldn’t make out what exactly was being said. They tried to enter but it was locked. Jack told me that he opened his mouth to call out to whoever was below, but the words got caught in his throat. As if his body was doing everything it could to keep him quiet.\n\nAnd apparently Clayton didn’t have the nerve to advertise their location either so the two of them just stood there in silence.\n\nUntil Clayton eventually whispered something to him.\n\nJack didn’t hear what he’d said at first, so he asked him to repeat it.\n\n“There’s people sitting on the stairs.”\n\n“What?”\n\nJack looked around, pointing his flashlight every which direction but couldn’t see any stairs. He couldn’t see anything at all.\n\n“Where are they?” he asked. “Where the hell do you see them?”\n\nNo response.\n\n“Clayton?”\n\nNothing. The guy was gone. Jack was in there by himself. But the thing is, he never actually heard Clayton leave. He was right behind him when they first entered and now he was gone.\n\nBut then who the hell had been whispering in his ear?\n\nAfter asking himself the question, he turned and bolted for the door.\n\nClayton wasn’t outside either. He was nowhere to be found at all.\n\nHe called it in, asked for some backup. Then he started to feel extremely light-headed and passed out shortly after. By the time he came to, he was laying in a hospital bed.\n\nHe was out for close to forty hours. During that time, another pair of officers were sent over to investigate the place. Both were then killed under mysterious circumstances. One of them was found buried in the backyard, his torso fully eviscerated. The other was found days later in a closet in an abandoned building on the other side of town with her head, hands and feet cut clean off. As for Clayton, he was never seen or heard from again.\n\nJack never ended up finding out what became of the case. The entire station seemed to be hush about it, trying to avoid making any mention of it at all. There were whispers, though, that they were never actually able to gain access to the basement. That a SWAT unit had been sent in and each one of those officers had either gone missing or ended up dead. That they tried burning the place down several times unsuccessfully. That the entire community was shortly evacuated and all roads leading to the place were subsequently blocked and taken off the map. That it’s now a controlled area being closely monitored by the FBI.\n\nHe was right. That was a hell of a lot to take in. But I was still confused.\n\n“So what does this have to do with me?”\n\n“The journal,” he said. “I ended up going through it afterwards. It was fucking weird. Just a bunch of names, dates and addresses. One of them was that apartment you live in. It even has the unit number.”\n\nI shook my head. It was hard to believe but then again so was everything else that had happened. “Well I’ve been there for over two years,” I tell him. “So why would something happen now?”\n\n“The date written next to the address. Today’s date.”\n\nI didn’t really know what to say.\n\n“So… what then? What do I do? Where the hell am I supposed to go?”\n\nJack sighed. “It goes deeper than what I’ve explained. It gets more complicated. You’ve become targeted by the director.”\n\nAnd this is the point where I began to lose the plot. He tells me that the director is some kind of obscure, extremely malicious entity. Something largely beyond our understanding. They don’t know where he came from, what rules he operates by or why he’s here. He first showed up during World War 1 in the trenches of northern France. Several soldiers from both sides had reported seeing him filming them during battle, standing right in the midst of vicious gunfire. They said that he wouldn’t fall to bullets. Couldn’t be burnt. Couldn’t be blown up. That he couldn’t die. That they saw him in their dreams. That he watched them while they were awake.\n\nIt attaches itself to people. No real rhyme nor reason behind who it chooses. But once it latches onto you, it won’t let go until it completes its objective. Which is capturing your death on camera.\n\nBut it won’t just kill you. It certainly could, but it chooses not to. Instead it aims to film and prolong your suffering. It can manipulate reality. It’ll force you question everything. It’ll turn you insane.\n\nI never told Jack about what I saw in the factory that night.\n\n“How the hell do you know this?” I ask him.\n\nHe sighs, stares at me blankly. I can see him starting to open his mouth but he just as quickly closes it.\n\nThen he smiles at me. Then he starts laughing.\n\nI shake my head. I’ve had enough of this shit. “What?” I ask him. “What the are you doing? What the fuck is this?”\n\nSoon the laughing devolves into an unhinged cackling, and I can see spit flying out of his mouth as he’s pounding the table with his fists. I look around the café but nobody seems to be disturbed by this. Actually nobody’s moving at all. They’re all melting.\n\nEventually he stops, his expression settling back into something more reserved.\n\n“I know the director personally,” he says to me. “He’s right behind you.”\n\nAs soon as he says this I stand up and make a beeline for the front door.\n\nStep back out onto the streets and start walking. No clue where the hell I’m going because nowhere feels safe now. I’m freaking the fuck out. I’m panicking.\n\nI’m looking over my shoulder after every other step, searching for that pale, dreaded figure. But I don’t see him. At least I don’t think I do.\n\nNot sure how long I walked for. Maybe hours. Eventually I find myself on an unfamiliar street and it’s completely empty. Now it’s getting dark out. My heart’s beating through my chest and I can barely concentrate on any singular thought. I need to settle down. I need a drink. I look around and see a liquor store up the street to my left. I head over there and walk in.\n\nThe only other person inside is the cashier and this comes as a relief. He smiles and gives me an enthusiastic greeting as I walk in though I can barely muster up a hint of a smile in response as I head towards the cool room.\n\nIt’s also mostly empty in there, save for a couple in the corner. Head for the malt liquor and I can hear them arguing. It’s a heated one. They’re really going at each other throats. Out of curiosity I start eavesdropping.\n\n“Why is it always my responsibility?” the guy shouts at her. “Why is it always fucking me?”\n\n“Just fucking do it!” she shouts back at him. “Quit whining, just go do it! Go and strangle him!”\n\n“Keep your voice down! Or else he’s gonna hear you!”\n\nSuddenly everything’s quiet and I hesitate before turning around.\n\nThey’re both staring at me now, their expressions maliciously vacant. The guy has one arm behind his back, and I can see a rope dangling between his legs.\n\nI take the bottle I’m holding and toss it at them and then run out of there, only to stop as I see somebody blocking the front door.\n\nIt’s a young dude. Lanky, pale skin, dark and messy hair, wearing a t-shirt and jeans. Large, unnerving eyes. Filming me with a black camcorder. Smiling.\n\nThe cashier’s sitting in the same spot, still smiling, still waving at me.\n\nI turn around and see the couple walking out of the cool room and towards me. The guy’s covered in malt liquor and I can see pieces of glass stuck in his cheek and eye.\n\nI look back at the director and see him walking towards me. And that’s it. I’ve reached my limits. I clench my jaw and close my eyes and start screaming.\n\nShortly after, I hear a loud crash, and I’m blasted with glass and drywall.\n\nOpen my eyes again chaos erupts. A large, black truck has rammed through the wall and people in tactical gear holding rifles are pouring out of it, shouting over each other. Bullets start flying and the air becomes heavy with dust and gunsmoke and then I’m tackled from behind. I feel rope fastening around my neck and as I get pinned to the floor, I see the director laying in front of me. There’s blood leaking from the side of his head but he’s still holding the camcorder. Still filming.\n\nAnd then I black out. When I came to however many hours later, I was lying in a bed in some hospital. There were cuts all over my arms and it felt like the skin had been peeled off of my throat. It hurt to swallow.\n\nI sat up, stared at the wall in front of me. I wanted to believe that everything had just been a dream but that wasn’t possible. The memories were clear. They were burned into my head.\n\nAfter a while this tall guy in a suit walks in, pulls up a seat next to my bed.\n\n“How are you feeling?” he asks me. “Are you okay?”\n\nI’m not exactly sure what to tell him so I default to “Yeah. I think so.”\n\nHe tells me that I was caught up in police trap. That the FBI had been tracking a wanted criminal and that he just happened to show up in that particular liquor store while I was in there.\n\n“What criminal?” I asked him. “What’d he do?”\n\nThe suit just smiles at me, tells me that all my questions will be answered later. To just relax and rest for now. Then he leaves before I can say anything else.\n\nI stew in my thoughts for some indeterminable amount of time before a nurse comes in holding a tray of food. She sets it down on the table beside me and I thank her. She smiles and leaves. I look over at the tray and see a rectangular package wrapped in brown paper. There’s a message written on it in black marker.\n\n*Final Cut*"},"50":{"title":"My coworker at the laundromat kept hiding inside the machines","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k97wzs\/my_coworker_at_the_laundromat_kept_hiding_inside\/","flair":null,"author":"Omin00se","selftext":"Last year I worked at a laundromat near my parents before I moved away to college. I saw the advert in the window when I was shopping with my Dad, and figured it was an easy way to earn some money. \n\nThe woman who ran the laundromat 'interviewed' me and I started that same day, but not before she introduced me to her daughter—who also worked there. She was called Mia, was really petite and really...odd. \n\nThe first time I met her she immediately said, \"Hey! Can you do this...?\"\n\nThen she did this weird thing with her eyes that made them vibrate. It's hard to explain, like they were rapidly moving side to side, and the whole time she had this toothy smile on her face like it was the most amazing thing in the world.\n\nMia must have only been a year or two younger than me, so still in her teens, but her behaviour seemed really juvenile and kind of try-hard.\n\nAnyway, I just figured she was trying to break the ice in her own way, so just kind of rolled with it. I got through the rest of the day with just small talk and didn't think too much of it.\n\nI was barely a week into the job when I first caught her hiding inside one of the machines. She'd somehow managed to climb up and curl herself up in one of the big tumble dryers. I wouldn't have even noticed had I not walked past and heard her giggling inside the drum, scaring the shit out of me.\n\n\"What're you doing?\" I asked, annoyed she was dicking around whilst I was working my ass off.\n\nHer large eyes watched me in the darkness, her legs pressed up against her flat chest. \n\n\"I'm just cleaning it.\"\n\n\"Right. Okay.\"\n\nI'd literally cleaned the lint out of the machine just this morning so didn't buy her bullshit for one minute. Anyway, she climbed out of the machine like a creepy gymnast shortly after, earning a few strange glances from some of the customers, but no one was hurt.\n\nThe next time was worse. About three days later I was helping this young mom set up a load of laundry after her machine broke in her apartment. It was her first time in a laundromat so she didn't really know where to start and had brought her kid along too, although she wasn't doing a very good job of keeping an eye on him.\n\nI'd just finished walking her through the different powders, prices and settings when I heard that same eerie, echoing giggle again towards the back of the store—only this time it was followed by a child's laughter. As soon as I heard the sound I had a weird hitching feeling in my gut. Although I'd only known Mia for about a week, I knew leaving a random kid with her would be like leaving them unattended by an open electrical socket. Anything could happen.\n\n\"Sorry, I'll be right back,\" I said to the mom, leaving her to load her washing into the machine.\n\nMost of the machines in the laundromat were 10kg washing machines. We also had a few larger 18kgs, and one massive front loaded 33kg machine used for washing duvets etc which Mia's mom had affectionately christened 'The Beast'.\n\nThe whole time I'd worked there I'd never seen it used once, yet I found Mia half inside The Beast that day, playing with the kid stood in front of it. Her bottom half was inside the drum, elbows resting on the rubber seal with the door open as she handed quarters to the boy. She was pulling funny faces and doing that weird thing with her eyes again, making him laugh. \n\nThe sight made me freeze for a second, wondering what the hell she was playing at.\n\nI heard the boy ask her, \"What do I do?\"\n\n\"Just close the door,\" she explained, \"and press the big red button.\"\n\nIt was only then I realized she was trying to bribe the kid into locking her inside the machine and switching it on.\n\n\"Mia!\" I hissed, hurrying through the maze of machines to confront her.\n\n\"But what will it do?\" The little boy asked her.\n\n\"I'll go on an exciting ride!\"\n\nI finally reached the door and grabbed it, putting an end to the madness. Both Mia and the kid looked annoyed, like I'd interrupted a great game of theirs.\n\n\"What did you think you were doing?\" I snapped.\n\n\"It was just a little fun—right kiddo?\"\n\nThe boy laughed as Mia tussled his hair before he finally scampered off back to his mother, who was still piling dirty underwear into the machine at the other end of the store, oblivious.\n\n\"Hey, just chill,\" Mia said, sensing my anger as she slid out of the machine. \"He wasn't really going to do it.\"\n\nI shook my head and walked away, knowing the kind of shit my own little brother would do for a few dollars.\n\nLater that day, Mia's mom came out of her office to check on us and I thought about ratting Mia out right there and then, but the way she seemed to always dote on her strange daughter like the sun shone out of her ass made me pause.  \n\nWhy would she believe me over her own flesh and blood? After all, I hadn't even made my first paycheck yet and I really needed the money. That thought alone ultimately made me decide to just let it slide.\n\nI didn't know how much I'd come to regret not bailing right there and then.\n\nA few days later Mia and I were both working the evening shift. It was nearing closing time and the place was dead. I was just putting a damp sock in the 'lost and found' basket when she appeared at my shoulder and asked, \"Do you like me?\"\n\nI frowned, and focused on the sock. \"Yeah, of course.\"\n\nI knew I'd over egged the lie as soon as it left my mouth, but I wanted to keep the job at least until college started. \n\n\"Then why do you never look me in the eye?\"\n\nI forced myself to turn away from the basket and finally face her.\n\n\"What d'you mean?\"\n\n\"Do you like me?\"\n\nHer face had a sudden seriousness to it. Whenever I'd seen her before she'd always had the ghost of a smile on her lips, and a playful look in her eye, but now she looked almost disappointed in me somehow.\n\nMy mouth felt dry as I croaked out a, \"Yes.\" \n\n\"Liar.\"\n\nI felt my awkwardness switch to fear as she did that weird vibrating thing with her eyes again, only this time they seemed to pull mine in. It was like I had tunnel vision all of a sudden.\n\nI tried to take a step back but my legs felt cut off from my brain. Instead, they followed her as she slowly walked backwards towards the row of machines lining the rear wall. \n\nPanic set in as I realized she was leading us straight towards The Beast. The playful look on her face returned as she sensed my fear.\n\n\"Don't worry,\" she said, her voice sounding like it was at the end of a tunnel. \"It's just a little fun.\"\n\nHer vibrating eyes never left mine as we reached the huge machine, she opened the door at her back and started to climb in. In my periphery, I saw her arms and legs contort in a nightmarish way. The whole time her head stayed fixed in space, her eyes now the centre of my universe. \n\nOnce she'd crawled inside her voice called to me from the darkness of the drum.\n\n\"Close the door and switch it on. Wash cycle, max spin.\"\n\nI felt powerless to obey. I watched as my arms closed the door and programmed the cycle. The panic inside of me rose, making me feel like I'd vomit if I still had control over my body. \n\nAs my finger hovered over the 'start' switch I held onto one last sliver of hope. The cycle wouldn't start without money and I was fresh out of quarters. Yet as she ordered me to start the machine and the button clunked home and the door locked without any complaints, I realized she'd already preloaded the coins. The sick creep had planned this right from the start.\n\nI heard the machine fill with water and felt tears spring into my eyes as I realized I was about to watch someone drown to death in the worst possible way. The drum part-filled to her chin but Mia never took her eyes off of me, not even as the machine started to spin.\n\nI didn't know if it was the trance like state she'd put me in, or if her neck wasn't...*human*, but her head filled that thick glass door and never rotated an inch. I remember watching a nature documentary on birds of prey and how owls’ heads remain stable in flight to better track their prey, and Mia’s face reminded me of exactly that. Just this pale, big, black-eyed face staring back at me through the glass. \n\nShe must have forced me to stand like that, watching her 'drown' for a good half hour because I remember the floor starting to shake as the machine hit its spin cycle. The drum whirled about her horrid face like an optical illusion, pulling me in and never letting me go until finally, the sudden surge of power caused the lights overhead to flicker.\n\nMy eyes lost sight of hers for a moment in the darkness, and I blinked for the first time in what felt like an eternity. The top halves of my eyeballs felt like dry gritted glass as they finally slid down on the tears collecting below.\n\nSuddenly in control of my own body again, I flung a hand over my eyes and looked away. I heard Mia calling to me from the machine, trying to get me to look at her again but I wasn't falling for it.\n\nMy brain felt foggy and my legs felt drunk. For a split second I thought about trying to switch The Beast off before realizing it wouldn't work mid cycle, and it'd only release the true monster currently trapped inside of it. Whatever 'Mia' was, clearly wasn't human and I dreaded to think what she'd had planned for me next.\n\nI remember half-running, half-stumbling past her mom's office door, praying it wouldn't open in case she tranced me too. Thankfully, I managed to stifle my sobs and it stayed shut, leaving me to slip out the laundromat door into the night. \n\nI never went back again. When my parents asked why I quit I told them I needed more time to focus on my studies instead, which seemed to shut them up. \n\nA couple of days ago, I finally mustered up the courage to look up the laundromat on Google Maps street view. \n\nI didn't know if I was hoping to see if the store had closed, or if anyone had left any bad reviews complaining about the creepy teenage girl that worked there, but I found neither. Instead, all I saw was what looked like another ad for hire in the window and the silhouette of a small woman with bleached blonde hair staring out the window. \n\nI didn't know if that was Mia, or just a bored customer, but I closed that browser window real quick. \n\nI'd hoped telling my story on here would somehow help me to process it, but now I've told it I don't really feel any better. I still can't use the dorm laundromat because every time I close the machine door I see her creepy owl-like face staring back at me.\n\nI'm either hand-washing or buying new clothes these days, which is breaking my bank account. I think I need help. Maybe I should see someone?"},"51":{"title":"The scariest spring break I ever had.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1ka804c\/the_scariest_spring_break_i_ever_had\/","flair":null,"author":"Subject-Thanks-6972","selftext":"I woke up from bed, excited to start spring break. So I took a shower, ate breakfast, brushed my teeth, got dressed, and decided to go play golf and fishing. However, when I got to the golf course, which also had a nice stream for fishing, it mysteriously turned night. Then, my golf club and fishing rod somehow came to life.\n\n\n\nI froze, and jumped back in fear.\n\n\n\n“Why are you afraid of us?” asked the golf club.\n\n\n\n“We’re just your golf club and fishing rod.” they both said.\n\n\n\n“You cannot be real items!” I said. “You don’t even look realistic!” The second I said that, I looked at them, and they had even creepier faces. Their eyes were literally red dots, and blood was coming out both of their mouths. I wanted to run and get help, but there was nobody around!  \n  \n\n\nSo I was literally trapped in the golf course with these two creepy objects that I could have been using, but instead, they seem like they wanted to kill me. Then they started to say to me:\n\n\n\n“Feed us.”\n\n\n\n“We’re famished.”\n\n\n\nI didn’t know what to say or do. I wanted to pick them up and throw them into the river, but I was too afraid to do so, as they could have bit my hand off if I tried to pick them up. So I just ran to the vending machine and bought a chocolate bar, then gave it to those weird freaks of nature.\n\n\n\n“What’s this?” they asked.\n\n\n\n“It’s a chocolate bar!” I said. “Just eat it, you’ll like it!”\n\n\n\nBut they just stared at the chocolate bar. After realizing they weren’t gonna eat it, I picked it up and ate it myself. \n\n\n\n“Weren’t you gonna eat the chocolate bar?” I asked.\n\n\n\n“No,” said the things. “Please give us something edible, like, maybe bring us an animal.”\n\n\n\n“You know what? I’m not doing that.” I said as I just busted down the gate and ran away.\n\n\n\nI had a whole list of stuff to do the next day.\n\n\n\nVisit the Zoo\n\nGo to the Fossil Museum\n\nEat frozen yogurt\n\nGo to the Planetarium\n\nBuy marshmallows\n\n\n\nAnd I hoped nothing would ruin it. \n\n\n\nThe next day, I visited the zoo. I saw all the animals. But just as I was about to go to the museum, the golf club and fishing rod ran away, and all the people ran for their lives, although a few people ended up getting eaten. However, the animals were all killed, but not all eaten. I saw a dead ostrich. I saw a zebra. I saw a caracara and a kookaburra next to each other. I saw a capybara.\n\n\n\nMan, would they follow me everywhere I went? I froze, then somehow, it turned night again. Then all the dead zoo animals and staff turned into zombies.\n\n\n\nZOMBIES?!?\n\n\n\nI admit, it’s pretty fun when you read books about zombies, maybe watch movies like Night of the Zoopocalypse, but now that I was in an actual zoo with actual undead animals, it was no laughing matter. The animals started chasing me, with the golf club and the fishing rod leading them. \n\n\n\nThe next day, I headed to the museum. I saw so many cool dinosaurs and other extinct animals, like the Ornithomimus. After leaving, I was waiting for it to become night again as expected, but nothing happened. Then, some strange blue light enveloped the museum, and then the you-know-whats started running out of the museum, the fossils and dinosaur displays, who have been brought to life, ran out. The golf club was riding on the Ornithomimus, while the fishing rod was riding a Giant Moa. \n\n\n\nI ran for my life and outran them. I then headed to the frozen yogurt place and ordered chocolate frozen yogurt with gummy worms on top. But just as I finished eating, they showed up. The staff ran for their lives as the yogurt machines and toppings were brought to life. So I ran.\n\n\n\nI went to the planetarium and looked at cool displays, and of course, the golf club and fishing rod showed up after I left. They brought the space displays to life, and the people ran for their lives, of course. I quickly ran and bought my marshmallows, and then of course, they came to the store and brought all the marshmallows (except the ones I bought) to life. I quickly ran away.\n\n\n\n I ran into the woods and stopped to catch my breath. I ended up staying there, so it was nighttime. Then I walked into the woods to use the bathroom there, and after finding a bush, I was about to start peeing when I heard them coming. So I quickly zipped up my pants, but after I did so, they were literally right in front of me. I was so shocked, I peed myself, but I didn’t care, as peeing your pants was way better than being eaten. Seriously, I could die by drowning in an ocean, but instead I was gonna get eaten by a golf course. People would be laughing at my funeral!\n\n\n\nI was seriously about to accept death when I heard the screech of a hawk. So I copied the screech, sending everything back to normal. The animals were back to the zoo, normal, the fossils and space displays were back in their museums, the marshmallows were back in the supermarket, the frozen yogurt stuff were back in place, and most importantly, the gold club and fishing rod were back to normal! \n\n\n\nI could finally enjoy myself, but still, this is your warning:\n\n\n\nIf your golf club and fishing rod come to life…\n\n\n\n**DON’T LISTEN TO THEM.**\n\n"},"52":{"title":"🚇🦟 The Things Beneath London","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k9u3cd\/the_things_beneath_london\/","flair":null,"author":"Itchy-Carpet-2114","selftext":"I’ve always loved the Underground. There's something about it that's nostalgic, like a secret world buried beneath the city, with its rhythm. But I've learned to be careful about what you fall in love with, because sometimes, the deeper you go, the darker the things hiding there get.\n\nIt happened one cold evening. I'd been working late, the usual routine. The last train home. Empty stations, echoing footsteps. It was the kind of silence that made you feel like you were the only person left in the world.\n\nI was just about to board the last train when I noticed them. At first, it was a vague feeling—like a slight itch on the back of my neck. Maybe a bug, perhaps a draft. But then that feeling became sharper, like a needle pricking my skin. I swatted at it, irritated, but it didn’t go away. It felt like something was following me. Something that wasn’t quite right.\n\nI tried to brush it off, but when I looked around, I saw them. Mosquitoes. They weren’t the usual ones that buzz lazily around in the summer. These were different. Bigger. Darker. Their wings made a sound that felt heavier than anything that small should be able to make. They circled the station in a slow, deliberate pattern. Not random, like mosquitoes usually are, but calculated. Intentional. There were more than a few, and they seemed to be watching me.\n\nI tried to ignore it at first. Mosquitoes are pretty common, right? But these... they weren't acting like normal insects. They didn’t scatter when I swatted at them. They didn’t seem to be leaving me alone. I felt something crawl under my skin, an itchy, burning sensation that didn’t make sense. I looked at my arm. There were already dozens of bites. Swollen, red, angry. But I didn’t have time to dwell on that. I just needed to get out.\n\nI pushed through the turnstiles and headed for the platform. But then, I wasn’t alone anymore. A few of the station workers were standing nearby. Their faces were pale and tired. One of them, an older man, noticed me looking and glanced around nervously.\n\n“You should be careful,” he said quietly, almost like he was talking to himself. “They’ve been multiplying in the tunnels. It’s worse than before. They breed down there—and it’s not just the mosquitoes.”\n\nI stared at him, confused. “What do you mean?”\n\nHe looked away, his eyes darting to the shadows. “They’ve been evolving. Growing. More aggressive. They’re adapting to the heat, to the damp. They’re becoming something else. Something meant to live down there now. And it’s not just them. It’s everything. The whole system’s changing.”\n\nI felt a chill run down my spine. “Evolving? In the tunnels?”\n\nThe old man nodded slowly, his gaze flicking nervously to the dark corners of the station. “It’s the heat from the trains, the moisture. The deeper you go, the more you feel it. The rats, the cockroaches...they’ve changed too. But the mosquitoes? They’ve found something. They’ve started feeding on more than blood. Their bites—if they don’t kill you—they make you different.”\n\nBefore I could ask more, the last train pulled into the station. He gave me a sharp look and turned away, disappearing into the shadows. I didn’t get the chance to ask him anything else.\n\nI tried to shake off his words, but the feeling of dread only deepened. When I stepped onto the train, the atmosphere was different. The air felt thicker, the buzzing around me louder. I glanced out the window, my reflection warping as the train jerked forward. The lights flickered in the tunnels. And then, another bite.\n\nBut this time, it wasn’t just a single prick. It felt deeper. Like something was crawling under my skin. The sting burned like it was digging in. And the worst part? I could feel them moving, burrowing deeper. I couldn't stop it. They were inside me.\n\nI started to panic. I pushed my way through the train, desperate to get to the door, but the tunnel stretched endlessly before me, a dark, twisting maze I couldn’t escape. The train kept moving, but I wasn’t sure it was even taking me anywhere anymore. Was I still in the Underground? Or had I crossed into something else? The station, the workers, the train, they all blurred together, a sickening fever dream.\n\nThe pain in my skin intensified as I reached the platform again, dizzy and shaking. The mosquitoes were still biting, still buzzing in my ears. I staggered to the surface, gasping for air. But they didn’t stop. My skin was on fire, crawling with an itch I couldn’t shake. Even outside, in the cold London air, they wouldn’t leave me alone.\n\nI still hear them. Every night. The buzz of their wings, crawling under my skin. I don’t know what happened down there, or what the workers knew, but I feel... different.\n\nSome say the mosquitoes aren’t just biting anymore. They’re changing us in tiny ways.  \nPassing things in their saliva.  \nNew infections, maybe.  \nMaybe something else.\n\n  \nI’ve heard stories. People who’ve gone missing, found weeks later with bites all over them, twitching and mumbling in strange, half-forgotten languages. Their bodies look wrong, like they’ve been remade, remolded for life underground.\n\nYou can still ride the Underground safely.  \nMostly.\n\nJust... don’t take the last train.  \nAnd if you feel a sharp prick on your skin and you’re alone in the carriage,  \n**don’t scratch it.**\n\nThey can smell blood.  \nThey can feel heat.  \nThey can *follow movement*.\n\nThe tunnels are their world now.  \nWe’re just passing through."},"53":{"title":"My parents made me keep a diary.

Something bad.\n\n\n\nAnd the goldfish...\n\nThat night, I swear to god, they all floated up at once.\n\nBodies stiff, mouths half-open, stuck like they were still trying to scream underwater.\n\nIf you watched long enough, it almost felt like they were whispering something.\n\nI didn't understand. I didn’t want to.\n\n\n\nMy parents acted like it was normal.\n\n\n\nUntil one day they put cameras all over the house.\n\n\n\nThey didn’t tell me why. They just said it was for \"security.\"\n\nBut the next morning, I caught them whispering in the kitchen.\n\n\n\n\"Did you see it last night?\" Mom asked, real low.\n\n\n\nDad didn’t answer right away. Then he muttered,\n\n\n\n\"It's reacting faster than we thought.\"\n\n\n\nReacting to what?\n\n\n\nI remember standing there, watching them. They smiled when they saw me. Like nothing was wrong.\n\n\n\n\"Morning, sweetie! Breakfast’s almost ready. Did you pack your school bag?\"\n\n\n\nThey always smiled too wide.\n\n\n\nA few days later they took me to meet this \"uncle.\"\n\nI don't remember his name. I barely remember the drive there.\n\n\n\nI just know that halfway through talking to him, I started feeling tired. Like, heavy, like my bones didn’t want to stay up.\n\nAnd then everything went black.\n\n\n\nWhen I woke up, I was back home.\n\n\n\nMom and Dad standing over me. Smiling.\n\n\n\n\"From now on,\" they said, \"you should write a diary every night. Write down everything you do. Everything you think. Be a good boy.\"\n\n\n\nSo I did.\n\n\n\nBecause I was a good boy.\n\n\n\nAt first, the diary was normal.\n\nMe writing about school. Homework. Dumb stuff.\n\n\n\nBut then...\n\nStuff started appearing in the diary that I didn’t write.\n\n\n\nIn red ink.\n\n\n\nThings like:\n\n\n\n\"You weren't polite to your teacher today.\"\n\n\"Don’t sneak snacks after dinner.\"\n\n\n\nSometimes there were drawings.\n\nLittle crude sketches of my room.\n\nOf me.\n\n\n\nI thought maybe... maybe Santa Claus was watching. Or some guardian spirit.\n\nI tried not to freak out.\n\n\n\nBut it kept getting worse.\n\n\n\nThe diary started telling me about things that hadn't happened yet.\n\n\n\n\"There will be a fire drill tomorrow. Don’t panic.\"\n\n\n\nGuess what?\n\nThere was a fire drill.\n\n\n\nThen it started telling me what to think.\n\nWho to trust.\n\nWho not to question.\n\n\n\n\"Don't worry about where Dad went last night. He's doing it for you.\"\n\n\n\n\"Trust the process.\"\n\n\n\nProcess?\n\n\n\nBy the time I was a teenager, I knew something was wrong.\n\nVery wrong.\n\n\n\nOne night, when my parents were out, I snuck into their room.\n\n\n\nFound their laptop.\n\nFound a folder on the desktop.\n\n\"Experiment No. 012\"\n\n\n\nInside?\n\n\n\nHundreds of photos of me. Charts. Brain scans. Notes. All about me.\n\n\n\nThere was one file I can't get out of my head:\n\n\n\n\"Subject 012: Neural restructuring at 60%.\"\n\n\"Dream function terminated successfully.\"\n\n\"Antisocial personality framework initializing.\"\n\n\n\nWhat the fuck was happening to me?\n\n\n\nI ran to the bathroom.\n\nLooked in the mirror.\n\n\n\nFor a second,\n\nI swear to god,\n\nI didn’t recognize myself.\n\n\n\nMy reflection smiled before I did.\n\n\n\nI grabbed a razor, sliced my finger—\n\n\n\nGreen.\n\nThe blood was fucking green.\n\n\n\nAnd then behind me—\n\n\n\nDad’s voice. Calm. Too calm.\n\n\n\n\"You're almost one of us.\"\n\n\n\nI don’t know how much time I have left.\n\n\n\nI still write in the diary every night.\n\nBut now?\n\n\n\nThe replies come before I even finish writing.\n\n\n\nSometimes they tell me things I don't want to know.\n\n\n\nSometimes...\n\nthey tell me things I’m about to do.\n\n\n\nAnd lately—\n\n\n\nthe handwriting?\n\n\n\nIt’s starting to look like mine."},"54":{"title":"I found a wallet in the forest. It used to tell me stories at night","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k9g48i\/i_found_a_wallet_in_the_forest_it_used_to_tell_me\/","flair":null,"author":"EmmaWatsonButDumber","selftext":"Ever since I was young, I've had a fear of water.\n\nI could never understand the comfort it brings to other people - it feels endless even when it's clearly contained, even when you can see where it begins and where it stops, even when you can feel the bottom of a lake and dig your feet into the soft, sticky mud. It feels... heavy, even when you float. It burns your eyes, leaves your body cold, like a corpse.\n\nI was the youngest out of five kids. Our summers were bland and uneventful - the days merged one into the other, resulting in some hybrid that remained imprinted in my mind as long, soulless breaks between school years. We lived by the sea, and my siblings would always go swimming until their skin wrinkled and softened. I would stand on the shore and watch them, until I got bored.\n\nThat's when I would go for long walks through the woods.\n\nI liked to pretend I was the sole survivor of a crash and had to gather supplies, but most of the time I would forget I was playing and end up treasure hunting. I would find rocks, bones, old clothes. My parents never let me keep them.\n\nThe woods were infinite to me, but a smaller infinite than the sea. They stretched as far as I let them and wouldn't disobey me. If the beach was theirs, the woods were mine. I think that's why I found it - I was the only one truly looking.\n\nAt first, it blended in with the roots and the dirt - I don't remember how I noticed it, but one minute I was wandering aimlessly and the next one I was crouched over, studying the worn out leather.\n\nI picked it up. It was lighter than I'd expected. I opened it and found some coins and two bills that didn't add up to a lot, and yet I pocketed them. I don't remember the last time I'd felt such pride - I was 11 and it was the first money I'd got my hands on that wasn't given by my parents. The wallet also contained two old pictures and a note - the first photograph was of a woman, turned away from the camera, and the second was of a child playing. I put the wallet in my pocket and unfolded the note.\n\n*Dear Austin,*\n\n*Beauty fades and rots. It is only the soul that haunts. Don't fear me when I walk behind you.*\n\n*Lori*\n\nI stared at the note. The handwriting was neat, but some letters were too sharp, as if the writer's hand was twitching. I wasn't superstitious, but something in me moved - I suddenly felt very small, very vulnerable in the middle of those woods. I looked up at the branches, then back down, and my shoulders tensed up.\n\nWas I... being watched?\n\nI tamed the pounding in my chest by reminding myself of the money, and how cool I would look in front of my siblings. I don't remember the way back to the beach - in fact, I don't remember much of that day, apart from the wallet. And the note.\n\nI marched triumphantly to my brother Rob and shoved the wallet into his face.\n\n\"Take a look. I'm not giving you a cent.\"\n\nHe took it, turned it over, opened it. Took one of the photos out.\n\n\"Where'd you get this, Oliver? In those woods?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" I grinned. Why wasn't he grinning back? Was he jealous?\n\n\"You know those woods are haunted, right?\" He raised his brows at me. \"Maybe you shouldn't take what's yours.\"\n\n\"Yeah, the tree ghost is gonna kill me for stealing their dusty ass photos.\"\n\n\"They might kill you, or worse.\"\n\nFor a moment, we just stared at each other. His seriousness had spread to me, and by the time his face cracked into a smile, I was genuinely considering giving it back.\n\n\"I'm fucking with you. Good job. First and last note you'll get from a girl.\"\n\nHe then threw the wallet back to me and went inside.\n\nMy other brothers and sisters weren't that impressed. I think I could've gone missing for days, and they wouldn't have cared.\n\nI threw it under my bed and went to sleep. I don't remember dreaming anything, and yet I kept waking up, pierced by the feeling that someone was coming, that something would happen. I think Rob's words had scared me more than I liked to admit. When I finally fell into a somewhat deep sleep, I had one dream. I was talking to my mom about my birthday, and she stopped in the middle of the conversation and casually asked me if I knew that someone was under my bed.\n\nI don't remember what I responded, and I don't remember the rest of the dream. All I know is that morning finally came and my fears of someone walking *behind me* left, scared away by the sun.\n\nI took the wallet from under the bed and opened it. The note was the same.\n\n*Dear Austin,*\n\n*Beauty fades and rots. It is only the soul that haunts. Don't fear me when I walk behind you.*\n\n*Laurie*\n\nI stared at the writing for the second time. Something was different about it, and yet I couldn't place my finger on it. I shoved it into a drawer and forgot about it until a few nights later.\n\nI was laying awake in bed, my wide eyes glued to the ceiling. I kept thinking about the dream and the note. *Something was different. Something was different about it.*\n\nI needed to take a third look and settle it for good.\n\nIn retrospect, I should have left it in the drawer. I curse 11 year old me for opening the wallet again and reading the note for the third time, in the dark, alone, barefoot on the cold wooden planks. Curiosity speaks louder than caution, after all.\n\n*Dear Austin,*\n\n*Beauty fades and rots. It is only the soul that haunts. Don't fear me for I am behind you.*\n\n*Laurie*\n\nMy heart instantly dropped, leaving my chest to feel empty and as light as paper. The more I remained frozen, the more afraid I grew to turn around. I started gasping for air and dizziness made it impossible to make out if the heavy breathing I was hearing belonged only to me.\n\nAfter what seemed like decades, I turned around. At that point, I'd completely disassociated.\n\nNothing was there.\n\nJust my bed and my closet.\n\n*It's under the bed.*\n\nThe thought suffocated me. No, it can't be. I won't look.\n\nI won't look, I can't.\n\nI kneeled. I could barely stand up anyway. I slowly lowered my face, as if something was forcing me, and greeted the darkness with a grimace.\n\nNothing was there.\n\n*It's in the closet.*\n\nI stood up, staring straight ahead. The closet stared back at me. There's not enough room for a person in there.\n\n*But a child could fit in there.*\n\nMy sweaty shirt was sticking to my back. I reached my hand out in the darkness, and turned on my lamp.\n\nThe room instantly became warmer, more welcoming. What an idiot. I should have done that way before. That's the thing with fear - for some, it can sharpen the mind. For others, it dulls the senses and rids them of any rational thinking.\n\nI triumphantly swung open the closer door.\n\nNothing was there. My clothes were hung neatly, pants and jackets and shirts. Nothing was there. I let relief wash over me for a good second, before I checked the note.\n\nIt was empty. I turned it over. Nothing was written on it. Absolutely nothing.\n\nI checked the photos. They were the same. In all honesty, even if they'd changed, I hadn't studied them well enough to notice. I shoved everything back in the wallet. I wanted to always be able to check it, so I put it under my pillow. This way, I could just turn on the lamp and take it out, without emerging from the comfort of my blankets.\n\nI didn't sleep at all that night. I kept checking the note, putting it in the wallet and opening it up again, in hopes that it would help.\n\nThe next night, I had the strangest dream.\n\nI was walking on the beach, and for the first time I didn't feel disgusted of the salty waves dancing at my feet. The smell of the sea filled my nostrils. Seagulls played in the distance, or hunted - to me, it seemed like playing. I didn't notice their cries of help - just as I didn't notice, at first, the second pair of steps that was matching my footprints in the sand.\n\nI stopped. The walking behind me stopped. I wanted to turn around, but I suddenly heard a voice right behind my ear.\n\n\"Don't. You'll be scared.\"\n\nIt was a woman's. At first, I thought it was my mother's. I seemed familiar, cheerful. Melodious. *Sing to me,* I thought. My feet had gone cold from the salty water, but I didn't care.\n\n\"I'm not your mother.\"\n\n\"Are you... the woman in the picture? Are you Laurie?\"\n\n\"I'm Laurie, yes.\"\n\n\"Were you...\"\n\nI felt a knot in my throat. \"Were you behind me? That night, in the room?\"\n\n\"I can only be behind you. You should always keep your back turned to the dead.\"\n\nOn a closer look, I realized I couldn't recognize the beach. It wasn't my beach, and the woman behind me was not my mother.\n\n\"Can I... wake up? Please?\"\n\n\"I'd like to tell you a story first. You like stories. I can tell - children always do.\" Her breath smelled like wet stone.\n\n\"If I listen, will you help me wake up?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course.\"\n\nHer responses seemed rehearsed. As if she'd read my thoughts, she whispered: \"I sat in those woods for so long, whispering to myself and practicing... Do you know the Star-Spiller?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"Is he... some sort of monster? I'm not scared of them, you know. Just as I'm not scared of you.\"\n\n\"No, he was not a monster. He was a man, and some would argue that was worse. He did something so, so wicked once, that the world titled in its sleep.\n\nHe was once a clockmaker. His hands could shove life into broken things, make them twist and turn by themselves. He lived with his loneliness and awaited his death, but a hunger began growing inside of him. One night, when the stars hung low and heavy, pulling down the sky itself, a woman knocked on his door with a watch that seemed to tick backwards and whisper to itself. Her smile stopped the clockmaker in his tracks, and her words came confident and piercing - *fix it, and I will tell you how to stop the world.*\n\nThe clockmaker agreed, but his heart hoped to outwit the things that come crawling out of the dark. He worked on it, forgot to eat and breathe and bleed - his eyes only saw the watch, his fingers remained curled forever, and in time... the watch began to *breathe*.\n\nWhen the woman came back for it, the clockmaker's heart had forgotten her. The watch spoke only to him now and it craved. It wanted. It needed.\n\nThe clockmaker crushed her skull like a ripe fruit, and the blood found the cracks of the watch just as a key finds a lock. The gears spun so fast they sang. Then, the clockmaker tried to turn the clock back. To use it. The thing about time is, it slips. I unravels, yes, but not neatly. The clockmaker watched rivers run backwards, beasts crawl and suns break over the horizon, and he changed.\n\nHe was no longer someone, but something. He is still out here, spilling the stars, one by one. Listen for him.\"\n\nHer last sentence melted into the sunrise, and I found myself shooting up from the bed, eyes darting from one corner to another. My head felt heavy, and my neck stiff. I walked aimlessly around for the whole day, unable to put my finger on the reason why I felt so uneasy.\n\nThe next night came, and I found myself on the same shore.\n\nHer voice came from behind me, her breath sour and wet.\n\n\"Have you heard of the Orchard's Keeper?\n\nHe was a farmer once. Loved his orchard more than anything - rows of fruit, bright and big and sweet and firm. Love comes hand in hand with greed, and the farmer wanted his fruit brighter and bigger and sweeter. A woman came to him once, and he listened. *Bury something precious at the roots. Something breathing.*\n\nAnd so he did. A rabbit, then a dog, frogs, anything that lived under the sun. The orchard grew, and so did its hunger. His wife's loud mouth was soon stuffed with dirt and her hair tangled in roots, and after her went the children. Then, the neighbors. The orchard grew hungry, and it didn't care who's flesh fed it. The farmer had nothing else to bury but himself.\n\nThe roots pulled him deep, into the heart of the earth and then deeper. His glimmering eyes went numb and his voice was forgotten, but he still grows the orchard from underneath. He feels your very steps in his hollow bones\"\n\nAnother story followed, and another. I would beg the gods to let the day pass swifter, so the night would come and bring another story.\n\nDays melted into weeks, and her clear voice seemed to linger even after I woke up. The characters bled into reality, and I began to have day terrors - night would comfort me, but I couldn't stand to be under the sun.\n\nI remember every single story, including the last. Especially the last.\n\n\"Have you heard of the Wallet Stealer?\n\nHe was a photographer - the best of the best. He had a camera, and a terrible appetite. One day, he found a wallet in the dirt, and kept it in his pocket. He forgot it, and the wallet grew heavier and heavier, until curiosity got the best of him and he pulled it out. He found himself staring at its own beating heart, and-\"\n\nSomething creaked in the distance. Somewhere in the sky, but also deep into my bones.\n\nI didn't hear the end of the story, because of the banging on my door. I woke up to my mother barging into my room, yelling.\n\n\"Oliver, who the hell are you talking to? WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO? WHAT DID YOU DO?\"\n\n\"Mom? What do you mean? What *did* I do?\"\n\n\"Who were you talking to? I heard this hoarse, awful voice through the door... who are you talking to? Is this why you're so tired during the day? What did you do to your hands?\"\n\nI stared at my bruised and scratched arms, unable to respond. Hoarse voice? \"I was dreaming, mom.\"\n\n\"No. What's that that you're holding?\"\n\nShe snatched away the wallet, and started looking through it. \"What is this?\"\n\n\"I found it in the woods.\"\n\nShe read the note, and her eyes widened in terror. Her mouth opened, then closed. She looked up to me. Then, behind me. Her frown suddenly dissolved, and her face grew sober. Was that... concern in her eyes?\n\n\"I understand. Maybe I should keep this to myself. It's... hurting you.\"\n\nI instantly calmed down, seeing her smile. Looking back, I realize she did what any rational parent would do and acted like everything was fine. She took me into her room and we watched TV together, until the stories faded from my mind and made room for her soft words and warm fingers.\n\nYears later, she told me she had seen something in the window, behind me, but didn't want to scare me. I asked her what the woman looked like, and what the note in the wallet said, but she refused to say."},"55":{"title":"The last day of summer","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k9up7s\/the_last_day_of_summer\/","flair":null,"author":"NathanielPhoenix","selftext":"Me and my friends were exploring this abandoned building once and it was crazier than we thought. \n\nSo me and my three friends, let’s call them Joe, Bud and Reagan. We were bored on the last day of summer and wanted something exciting to do. Bud said “ how about we go explore something?” At first we didn’t really want to do that. It felt too boring. All the abandoned buildings around our town were already explored or demolished but Bud told us about a new abandoned building. One that any of us had ever heard about. We hadn’t even seen the building even though almost all of us had lived in that town for 18 years. Except for Reagan, he moved in a couple of years back.\n\n\nOnce Bud told us about a house that we had never heard of. All of us got very excited. All the other abandoned buildings were lame but this one sounded very thrilling. “The building is said to be an old psych ward,” Bud said. That got us even more excited. “How old is it?” I asked. “ I don’t really know.” Bud said. “All I know is that it’s abandoned and supposed to be very scary and there may even be traps” Bud added. “Wow” we all said in unison. The traps made it more exciting for us because we were young and thought it’s like a video game. We got outside, hopped on our bikes and took off.\n\nWe stopped by a store and got some snacks and energy drinks to enjoy, while we were inside the building. Then it was time to go. We went into a forest nearby. Bud was the only one who knew where this place was. That made me a little bit suspicious about this whole thing. That and the fact that this was supposed to be an abandoned psych ward that none of us knew about. We walked on this path through a dense forest. The path was old and no one had been there in ages. Or so we thought. It was dark even though it was during the day because the forest was that dense.\n\n\nThen I started to see light coming through the thick leaves and branches and a building. “Pretty small” I thought. The building was quite small, about the size of a 2 story house. It looked small because I imagined a psych ward to be huge. It looked abandoned but not completely worn off by the weather. The windows had bars on them and the paint was in pretty good shape. Few cracks here and there but nothing big. Surprisingly it did not have any fence or gate surrounding it, just the building in the middle of the woods. “How the hell have we not heard about this?” Joe said. “I don’t know” I answered in disbelief. We walked up to the front door. It looked almost normal but it too had bars on its windows. We tried the handle. “Click” The door unlocked and we opened it.\n\nAs we got inside everything looked brand new. Walls were painted a light blue color and the floor was made from wood. All in darn good shape for an abandoned building. Everyone was pretty anxious about the whole thing, I could feel it. “How long has this even been abandoned?” I asked. “I don’t know but it doesn’t look abandoned” Bud said with this horrified look on his face. He looked like he didn’t have any clue about this place and from how he talked earlier it seemed like he had been inside this building before. “So you have never been here?” I asked with a small bit of anger in my voice. “Nope,” he told us. Now we all were scared as hell. I sensed that in each one of us.  We were all scared and wanted to get out but our egos didn’t allow it and we continued exploring.\n\nWe went into a room. It had a sofa in it and a couple of chairs with restraints on it. “Wow this actually is abandoned and old,” Reagan said. “These types of chairs are not used anymore,” He added.  Apparently he was really into abandoned hospitals and psych wards and had been researching them alot.  Then we heard a ghostly voice whisper  “get out”. “What the fuck” Joe said loudly. Then we heard a door slam shut and footsteps followed by what seemed to be chains rattling or someone walking with chains on their body. We looked behind us and the door to the room was closed. “did that door just slam shut?” I stuttered. I was terrified and almost had a panic attack. “ I think it did” Reagan said also stuttering. “We need to get out!” Bud yelled. \n\nSo we did. Joe went first and opened the door slowly. We heard nothing. We stepped back in to the lobby. We heard a whisper “sssss” but I couldn’t hear what it said. Then we heard the chain rattle again. It sounded like it was coming closer and it was. Every second that passed that sound came closer and closer.\n\nWe started walking towards the exit. We wanted to get out of there.  I tried to open the front door but it didn’t open. “What?” I thought. We just came in from that door maybe 20 minutes ago. “It’s locked,” I said, visibly shaking. “We have to find another way out,” said Joe. He didn’t seem scared at all. That calmed me down too because what could happen to us, right?\n\nWe started to walk inside the building looking for a way out. The rattling was gone. Weird. Then all of a sudden we heard another slam sound. I looked behind us and I can still see that picture in my head. \n\nThere it was, Bud. Laying on the floor. Not moving nor breathing. I checked his pulse and he was dead. He had a plank attached to his head with lots of blood on the floor. “What the fuck” I yelled and we started running towards the exit. I was so scared that I almost couldn’t run. We made it to the exit and opened the door. “How the fuck is it unlocked?” Reagan yelled. And he started to cry as well. Then we started to run away from there so fast that we even forgot our bikes.\n\nI glanced back at the building and I saw lights on in one room and a weird figure just waving at us. We stopped to catch our breath and I called the police. We waited for what felt like at least two hours but in reality it was maybe 20 minutes. The cops arrived and we explained what happened. They went in and came out maybe 10 minutes later. They said that Bud was really dead but the house was also empty. We were all shocked and started to cry a little. Or at least me and Reagan did. Joe was calm, too calm. It was bizarre. Our friend just died and all because we entered that abandoned ward. I never thought that this would be the last time I’m going to see Bud.\n\n"},"56":{"title":"I found a disturbing dark web video series, and the star of the show looks exactly like me.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k9flkw\/i_found_a_disturbing_dark_web_video_series_and\/","flair":"Series","author":"11velociraptors","selftext":"This happened almost a month ago, but it's only as of today that I had the wherewithal to start writing it all down. I want to share what happened to me as part vent and part precautionary tale, and so I hope you understand why I'm keeping the details vague. \n\nI'm 21F and about to graduate college. Since sophomore year, I've worked part-time as a barista at a coffee shop. Up until a few weeks ago, it was a great gig. I was well paid, I got free pastries, and many of my coworkers became close friends of mine. One of said coworkers is relevant to this story, and to protect her privacy, I'll refer to her as \"Lydia\" henceforth. \n\nEvery once in a while, I would get hit on by a patron, but it never escalated beyond a few sometimes creepy comments. I had previously never felt unsafe at my workplace, especially with all of my coworkers and regulars around. That changed about a month ago, when this whole ordeal began. It was around 4 in the afternoon, a pretty quiet time for the cafe, and I was refilling the pastry display. All of a sudden, Lydia comes up to me and says, \"Hey, that guy at Table 10 has been staring at you for a really long time. Do you two know each other?\"\n\nI looked at the corner table and instantly saw the patron in question. He wasn't a regular and he was a lot older than our usual clientele, probably in his late fifties. He had large, light blue eyes and thick, worm-like lips. I expected him to look away after I spotted him, or maybe to give me a suggestive wink and smile. The patron did neither. Not only did he continue staring at me, but he did so with an expression of pure shock on his face. He looked as though he'd seen a ghost. After an awkward staring contest, he rose from his seat and approached the counter. \n\nBefore I could do my usual spiel—\"How was the drink, sir? Can I help you out with anything else today?\"—the man said, \"Angelica?\" \n\n\"That's not my name, sorry.\" \n\n\"Oh, right. It's only a stage name, then?\" His voice was soft and high-pitched, as if atrophied. I had no clue what he was talking about and told him as much, albeit in more polite terms. What followed was a brief but frustrating conversation; the man, seemingly convinced that I was someone else, kept asking me about a video series that he'd seen me in. Specifically, he was interested in commissioning me for a video. By the way he danced around the exact content of said videos, I had a feeling that he was alluding to pornography. \n\nAt one point, he mentioned that name of what I presumed to be the platform he was watching these videos on. I obviously won't give the exact name here, but for the purposes of this account, I'll pseudonymize it as \"Doves\". \n\nAfter some more back and forth, I was starting to think that the guy wasn't completely alright in the head. It would explain his insistence and his generally strange demeanor. However, just as I was about to ask him to leave, the man suddenly went quiet, sighing as though collecting himself. After a moment, he gave me a wink. I remember his eyelids audibly clicking as they opened and shut. \n\n\"You don't have to be nervous,\" he told me. \"I'm a fan of yours. Look.\" He then took his phone out of his pocket, spent a minute searching for something, and then held the phone out to me. I don't know what got into me exactly—sheer curiosity, I guess—but I took the phone from his hands to look at the image he'd pulled up. \n\nOn the greasy screen was a photo of a young woman in an empty white room. The lighting was harsh and flat, lending an uncanny effect to an already bizarre composition. The woman stood close enough to the camera that you could only see her body from the waist up. She held her arm out towards the camera, showing off what seemed to be a puncture wound on her forearm. There was a large bruise encircling the area, and the wound itself was clearly infected, caked with old blood and pus. I looked up from the arm to her face, and despite the strange lighting, I was shocked by how much it looked like my own. She had my eye color and shape, my nose, my jaw, even my freckles. I dropped the phone onto the counter with a gasp and the man scrambled to pick it up. \n\n\"What the fuck is that? Where did you get this photo!?\" I shouted, losing all pretense of nonchalance. The cafe went quiet, customers looking over at us and a few of my coworkers stepping closer to me. Seeing this, the man scowled and began muttering under his breath. I only caught a few words: \"uppity bitch\" and \"good money\" among them. He exited the shop in a huff, leaving an untouched cup of coffee on the corner table. \n\nAfter he left, I took 15 in the break room to compose myself. The photograph of the woman burned in my mind's eye. This \"Angelica\" seriously could have been my long-lost identical twin. I pulled out my phone and did a preliminary search for \"Doves\", the website (at least I assumed it was a website) that the man had mentioned, but I saw nothing that looked like a content sharing platform. I resolved to do a more thorough investigation once I returned home and had access to a computer. I made it through the rest of my evening without further incident. \n\nI worked the closing shift that day: 2 to 10 at night. When at last my coworkers and I finished all of our closing tasks, I put on my coat and stepped out of the building. The moment I felt the cold air on my face, the thought of walking two blocks to my car made me sick with fear. Lydia walked me to my car, which I greatly appreciated. She's a good head shorter than me, but she carries, so I felt a hell of a lot safer braving the dark beside her.  When I reached my car, I checked the trunk and backseat. After assuring myself that there was no-one waiting for me inside, I bid my friend goodnight and we parted ways. \n\nI had plenty of time to reflect during my thirty minute drive home. Embarrassing as it is to admit, I was a former pageant kid. I competed for most of my childhood, at the behest of my former beauty-queen mother. As a teenager, my mom tried to get me into modelling. It never went anywhere, but the amount of times my parents made me sit for digitals gave me some long-term scopophobia. To this day, I don't have any public social media as a result. I think anyone would be disturbed if a stranger confronted them in the way my customer did me, but my background made the experience impossible to shrug off. I needed to figure out who the hell this \"Angelica\" woman was, even if I knew I might not like what I discovered. \n\nI got back to my apartment at around 10:30 at night and the first thing I did was grab a drink, hoping it would soothe my anxiety. Unfortunately, the alcohol seemed to have the complete opposite effect. Never before had I regretted living alone so much. The fact that I lived on the first floor of the apartment building, usually a great convenience, also seemed at that moment to be a point of vulnerability. I checked that all of my doors and windows were locked before settling into my desk to begin my research. \n\nWhen checking the lock on my bedroom window, I stole a glance outside at the street. My apartment building has no attached parking garage, so the streets outside are lined with cars at all hours of the day and night. I've become familiar with my neighbors cars to the point where I can recognize when one of them is missing. It's for this reason that I picked up on the unfamiliar  Cherokee XJ across the street. The dark blue car, which I initially mistook for my neighbor's Isuzu Trooper, blended in well with its surroundings despite being an unusual model. I don't think I would've noticed it at all had the events of the day not left me so paranoid. I didn't see anyone inside, and it wasn't as though there was anything I could do about it, so I just closed my shutters and focused on the task at hand. \n\nAt 10:45, I sat down at my desk with nothing but a woman's name and what I believed to be the name of a website. For a full hour, I poked around on the web to no avail. I started off with searches like \"Angelica arm puncture wound video\" and \"Angelica arm white room doves\" and then tried more detailed queries. I searched around increasingly obscure forums dedicated to all manner of topics from body horror art to grotesque auto-portraiture photography. Several drinks later, it occurred to me that I might be conducting my investigation in the wrong place—more specifically, on the wrong layer of the web. I hadn't wanted to confront the notion previously, but there was a chance that Angelica was producing some kind of self-harm fetish content, and if that were the case, I wasn't sure how much I'd find about her content on the surface web. \n\nSince I don't want anyone reading this to go on to search for the website, I'm not going to get into the details of my search. I will say, though, that once I got onto Dread, it wasn't nearly as hard to find as I thought. By midnight, I had found what I was looking for. \n\nThe website's homepage was minimalistic—white text on a pure black background. It had a heading, \"**DOV3S**\", and a subheading, \"**3 friends creating exclusive content with love**.\" Beneath were three names that let me know I was in the right place:\n\n**> angelica** \n\n**> mary**\n\n**> adam**\n\nI steeled myself and clicked on \"angelica\". This portion of the site was a single, sprawling page that seemed to scroll for miles. Up at the top was a message, supposedly written by the woman herself: \n\n**angelica. 8teen. durable. i <3 my fans!!**\n\n**no longer accepting commissions.**\n\n**price varies on a per-video, per-photoset basis.**\n\n**click title for duration\/thumbnail\/price info**\n\n**!!! VIDEOS BEFORE 1\/14\/23 DO NOT HAVE AUDIO !!!**\n\n**!!! NO REFUNDS !!!** \n\nBeneath the introductory text was a subheading that read \"free sample\", and beneath that was an embedded video, two minutes in duration. \n\nI pressed play. The video buffered for a long while, then began. It faded from black into a familiar shot. In the same white room I'd seen in the customer's picture, there she stood. She—\"Angelica\"—looked *awful*, far worse that she'd looked in the photograph. Her jaw clenched and unclenched strangely and her eyes were wide and darting, like a wild animal's. There was a giant, half-healed gash in her cheek and her left arm was covered in bandages, perhaps suggesting that this video was filmed after the customer's photo was taken.   \n\nThe woman wearing my face gave the camera an uncertain smile. She held up a hand, showing her palm, then turning it around to show the back. She then slowly set her hand palm-down on a small wooden table below her. The camera tilted downwards, following her hand in such a way that indicated another person was filming with a handheld. The camera lingered on her hand for a moment. I heard someone inhale. And then, a hammer came down on the woman's hand. \n\nAfter the blow, the camera jerked back up to her face. She started making this pained moaning sound. Her mouth twisted and I saw tears welling up in her eyes. The camera moved back down to her hand, where a deep bruise was already welling up under her skin. I paused the video here to scroll down, reading through the myriad of titles listed beneath it. The most recent link was called \"blunt force 33\", followed by \"blunt force 32\", \"puncture 12\".\n\n \"eye infection\". \n\n\"needles under nails\". \n\nI felt dizzy. I had to stand up and pace around the room to keep from puking my guts out. Maybe I should've stopped there, but for whatever reason, I felt like I had some responsibility to finish. I pressed play once more. \n\nDown again came the hammer, this time landing atop the knuckle of her forefinger with a *crack*. Four more blows rained down on the hand, one for each knuckle. By the end, the sounds coming from the woman didn't seem entirely human. It didn't sound like me, but it was hard to tell. I'd never been in that kind of pain before. I didn't know what I'd sound like.\n\nIn the last few seconds of the video, the camera was raised and angled downwards such that you could see both \"Angelica's\" face and mangled hand. The shot gave the viewer a better view of her chest and the small, spade-shaped birthmark a few inches beneath her clavicle. It was this all-too-familiar mark that removed any lingering ambiguity about what I was watching. Angelica was no coincidence, no circumstantial doppelganger. \n\nShe was a deepfake of *me.*\n\nWhen the video ended, I sat staring at the final frame until my laptop went to sleep, too shocked to do anything else. I couldn't believe what was happening to me. I still can't. I've done everything \"right\": all my life I've kept my socials private and generally minded my own business. I've stayed modest, low-profile, and out of the spotlight for all of my young adulthood. I never even sent nudes to my ex-boyfriend, despite his insistence, because I was afraid of what would happen to them if we ever had a nasty breakup.   \n\nAs it turned out, we did have a messy breakup. In the immediate aftermath of that video, as I wracked my memory for answers, I couldn't help but think of my ex. If I were a public figure, then the culprit behind the deep fakes could've been anyone; but for a nobody like me, it had to be someone close. Someone with access to my private photos. The thought made me shudder. Could my ex really have taken things that far? Did he actually hate me that much? I had a sudden urge to call him and demand answers, but I knew that wouldn't get me far. It would be easy enough for him to lie if he was the culprit, and then he would know I was onto him.\n\nThere was much left for me to explore on the DOV3S website, but after my discovery, I wasn't in the right state of mind to keep investigating. I thought about calling someone, maybe Lydia or my parents, but for some reason, the thought of doing so filled me with tremendous embarrassment. Even though I knew deep down that it wasn't my fault, I couldn't help but feel ashamed of the videos, even if I had had no role in their creation. \n\nI needed sleep, but knew it would be nearly impossible, and so I popped a few sleeping pills and crossed my fingers. After tossing and turning in bed for a few minutes, I got up to use the bathroom, which required walking down the hallway past my front door. When I got to said door, I stopped, noticing a strange shadow coming from the hallway. It looked as though someone had placed an object right outside my door. I walked closer to look, about to crouch to peek under the door, when the shadow suddenly moved. It hadn't been an object at all, but rather a person standing in front of my door. I heard their footsteps thudding down the carpeted hallway. By the time I looked through the peephole, it was too late to see anyone, and I certainly wasn't about to open the door to look for them. I immediately suspected that it had something to do with the blue Cherokee, which was still parked across the street when I stole a glance out the window. \n\nSuddenly, I had no desire to sleep anymore, but the pills were already doing their job. I wanted to stay alert in case whoever was outside my door returned, but fighting against the drowsiness was like trying to outrun a monster in a nightmare. The last thing I imagined before I slipped into unconsciousness was my own face smiling jubilantly as a hammer smashed my hand into a bloody pulp.\n\n  \n\n\n[Update #1](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/11velociraptors\/comments\/1kb1bji\/i_found_my_doppelganger_on_the_dark_web_now_her\/)"},"57":{"title":"Whispering Teeth","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k9h165\/whispering_teeth\/","flair":null,"author":"UnalloyedSaintTrina","selftext":"No one knows where he came from. No one really understands how he died, either.\n\nWe all woke up one morning, and Dough was just…there. \n\nSlumped over belly-first against the Cemetary gates, naked as the day he was born. No pulse, no signs of external trauma, no nearby missing persons reports that fit his description.\n\nNo ID, for obvious reasons.\n\nOur city’s medical examiner, who also moonlights as the father of my children during his off-hours, informally christened him “Dough”. The corpse was short, pale, and exceptionally pudgy around the midsection. In other words, an unidentified body with Pilsberry Dough-Boy like proportions.\n\nSo instead of being a “Doe”, he was a “Dough”. It's tacky, I'm aware. Given his profession, you’d think he’d have more reverence for the dead.\n\nTo his credit, he came up with the nickname *after* he performed the autopsy. \n\nJim’s a resilient, dauntless individual. You stare death in the face enough times I think the development of an emotional carapace is inevitable. On the rare occasion something *does* rattle him, dumb jokes are his go-to coping mechanism. It’s a bit of a tell, honestly. He doesn’t resort to gallows humor under normal circumstances.\n\nSo when he arrived home that night cracking jokes about “Dough”, I knew something was bothering him. I wanted to press him on it, but I was initially more preoccupied with how Paige was doing.\n\nYou see, my daughter discovered Dough. She could see him propped up against the black steel bars from her bedroom window as the morning sun crested over the horizon.\n\nTurns out, she was feeling fine. More curious than disturbed. In retrospect, I suppose that shouldn’t have been surprising. Paige received a crash course on death and dying way ahead of schedule. It’s hard to tiptoe around the taboo when your mom owns and maintains the Cemetary, your dad is the county coroner, and you just so happen to live *next* to said Cemetary.\n\nPaige reassured me that if the whole thing started to make her feel uneasy, she wouldn’t hesitate to tell me or Dad, but she doubted it’d come to that with Pippin by her side. Our trusty St. Bernard would ward off the icy inevitability of death, like always.\n\nLater that night, after Paige had gone to bed, Jim spoke up without me prying, emboldened by a few generously poured glasses of wine.\n\n*“Whoever he was, he took superb care of himself,”* he remarked, sitting back in the porch chair, eyes pointed towards the stars.\n\nLeaning in the front doorway, I glanced at him, puzzled.\n\n*“Wait, what? Isn’t the whole joke that he’s, you know…pleasantly rotund? Out-of-shape? Giggles when you poke his belly, like in the commercials?”*\n\nHe forced a weak chuckle.\n\n*“No, you’re right. Dough is certainly uh…yeah, pleasantly rotund is a diplomatic way to put it. That’s what’s so odd, I guess. You’d think he’d look as unhealthy inside as he did on the outside. But every organ was pristine. Fresh out the box. Like he jumped from the pages of an anatomy textbook. Couldn’t find a single thing wrong with him, let alone determine what actually killed him.”*\n\nThe chair legs screeched against the porch as he stood up. He walked forward, settled his elbows on the railing, and put his head in his hands.\n\n*“And he doesn’t giggle - Dough chatters.”* He muttered.\n\n\\- - - - - \n\nHe would go on to explain that he witnessed the unidentified man’s jaw spasm at random times throughout the autopsy, causing his teeth to chatter like he was experiencing a postmortem chill.\n\nNearly gave my husband a coronary the first time it happened. Still definitely dead, by the way. Jim had already cracked the ribs and removed his heart.\n\nThe faint clicking only lasted for a few seconds. A half an hour later, it happened again. And again ten minutes after that, so on and so on. Had to convince himself it was a series of atypical *cadaveric spasms* so he could complete the procedure without succumbing to a panic attack.\n\nBut no corpse had ever done that before. Not in his thirty years of experience, at least.\n\nWhen he slid Dough into his temporary resting place, a refrigerated cabinet in the morgue, he was more than a little relieved. If his teeth were still clinking together every so often, the metal tomb made it inaudible. Jim considered opening the door and listening in.\n\nUltimately, he decided against it.\n\nWe hoped an update would find its way to us over the weeks and months that followed. Jim had plenty of loose lipped contacts in the police department. We did hear about the case, but the news wasn't illuminating. Unfortunately, the investigation into Dough’s identity went nowhere fast.\n\nThe first and only lead was a total dead end, and it created more questions than answers.\n\nCC-TV from local businesses revealed Dough popping out from an alleyway about twenty minutes before Paige called me into her room. Sprinting at an unnatural pace for his proportions. A stout, flabby cheetah. Not peering behind him like he was being chased or anything, either. He just made a B-line for the Cemetary. A man on a mission.\n\nHere’s what really had everyone scratching their heads, though: the alleyway he appeared from is heavily surveilled on both sides, but there’s zero footage of Dough *entering* on the other side. No windows on the walls of that narrow corridor, either.\n\nThe only workable explanation was that Dough climbed out of a sewer grate present in the alleyway. Naked. No one loved that explanation. Per Jim, he didn’t smell *feculent* on arrival, either. He couldn’t recall the corpse having any odor at all.\n\nA thorough police search of the tunnels beneath that alley revealed only one cryptic anomaly. Nobody could make heads or tails of it. More than that, no one could say for certain that it was even *related* to Dough. It was definitely as bizarre as him, but that was the only discernible connection.\n\nA circle drawn in red chalk with about a hundred empty sun-flower seed packets neatly stacked in the middle, only twenty yards from the sewer grate Dough supposedly materialized out of.\n\n\\- - - - - \n\nYears passed, and Dough quickly became a distant memory. A story told in a hushed but theatrical voice to enthrall wide-eyed dinner guests. No more, no less.\n\nUntil last month, when it became my turn to deal with his uncanniness. I received a call. Dough’s clock had run out. He needed to be removed from the morgue.\n\nIt was time to bury him.\n\nHistorically, the unclaimed dead were eventually buried in what’s called a *Potter’s Field*, on the state’s dime, of course. I don’t know the exact origin of the term. Try not to hold that against me. I’m confident it’s a biblical reference. Beyond that, your guess is as good as mine.\n\nBasically, it was a mass grave with a nicer name. \n\nMost cities have strayed from that practice nowadays. Cremation is much cheaper than a pine box. I live in one of the few hold-out cities that still utilize Potter’s Fields. If I had to speculate, I’d say we’ve resisted that change because of the high percentage of Greek Orthodoxy present in our community. It’s one of the few Christian faiths that hasn’t evolved to accept cremation.\n\nI procured only the finest of pine boxes for our old friend Dough. Less than forty-eight hours later, we lowered him into an unmarked grave.\n\nJim asked me if I heard any chattering. Thankfully, I did not.\n\nAll was quiet for about a month. Then, the stray animals started appearing.\n\nIt was just a few at first. A mangy-looking cat here, a devastatingly-emaciated dog there. I’d see them wandering around the graveyard, searching for something that always led them to the foot of Dough’s grave. A weird nuisance, sure, but our city is full of strays, so it didn’t alarm me. Couldn’t say what was so enticing about the area Dough was buried. I rationalized the phenomena as best I could and moved on.\n\nThings escalated.\n\nBefore long, it wasn’t just a few lost animals loitering through the grounds. It became a coalition of animals dead set on unearthing Dough. A task force of unlikely allies - cats, dogs, raccoons, foxes, bats - joining together under the same banner to bring their unusual goal to fruition. Even Pippin began enlisting in the cause, ignoring his training and leaving the backyard at night, something he’d never done before.\n\nMr. Thompson, our grounds keeper, just wasn’t prepared for such an onslaught. He’d visit Dough’s grave multiple times a day, blaring his whistle, trying to get the animals to disperse. We ended up temporarily hiring his nephew to do the same at night. Two days ago we were forced to call animal control because the whistle wasn’t doing jackshit anymore. The strays just ignored it and kept digging.\n\nYesterday morning, Mr. Thompson barged into the house, drenched in sweat and trembling like a child. He begged me to follow him. There was something I needed to see with my own eyes.\n\nWhen we approached Dough’s grave, I couldn’t quite grasp what I was looking at. From the front, it appeared to be some sort of discolored potato, a red-blue spud peeking out of the soil. The growth had many ridges, tubes that slithered and twisted under the violaceous peel towards the apex, almost vascular in their appearance. I spied a few bite marks as well.\n\nI squinted and noticed something else: hundreds of incredibly thin, crimson sprigs emerged from the length of the tuber: dainty threads that connected it to the surrounding dirt, faintly pulsing every second or so.\n\n*“What do you suppose it is?”* I asked Mr. Thompson, standing in front of the mysterious polyp, perplexed but not yet afraid.\n\nWordlessly, he walked to the opposite side of it, and pointed at something.\n\nI followed him. I wish I hadn’t.\n\nA glossy, curved half-crescent covered the back-half of the growth. It was opaque at the bottom, with a line of yellowish coloration at the top.\n\nIt looked like a fingernail.\n\nSomething about the soil had allowed Dough to…I don’t know, expand? Bloom? I’m not sure what the right word is.\n\nAnd when I listened closely, I could appreciate a high-pitched, rapid, clicking sound in the earth below my feet. \n\n\n\\- - - - - \n\nThe last twenty-four hours have been an absolute whirlwind. Long story short, the entire Cemetary is on lockdown. We called the cops, and they called in the government. They’ve quarantined me, Jim, Paige, and Mr. Thompson to the house. Armed men standing at every exit, something I thought only really happened in the movies.\n\nI think their efforts may be too late, though.\n\nIt’s the middle of the night where I live. An hour ago, I woke up to a weighty thump at the foot of our bed, where Pippin likes to sleep.\n\nI crawled out of bed and found our dog lying on the floor, unresponsive and pulseless. I shook Jim awake. We argued about what to do. How to tell Paige.\n\nA sound cut our deliberations short. We rushed out of the room and shut the door behind us. \n\nThat said, I can still hear it from across the hall. The chaotic ticking of a time bomb that we’re praying isn’t airborne. \n\nBirds are beginning to crash into our bedroom window. \n\nIf I had to guess, I think it’s a call of sorts: sharp whispering in a language we can’t understand. \n\nThe dead clicking of Pippin’s [chattering teeth.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/unalloyedsainttrina\/s\/fa07YuRH0e)"},"58":{"title":"A Howl in the Mountains","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k9ifn8\/a_howl_in_the_mountains\/","flair":null,"author":"dorimarcosta","selftext":"The old diesel truck coughed loudly before falling completely silent, parked next to the tool shed. The engine had a life of its own, just like the house’s power generator, which had already failed three times that week. \"It's a gas guzzler,\" Dad used to say. We always kept a can of gasoline next to the outdoor cabinet — an emergency measure we knew we’d eventually need. Life out there was like that: patched together, fragile, but functional — at least most of the time.\n\nThe night before, the usual calm of the farm was broken by the frantic barking of the dogs. Dad, used to small intrusions by wild animals, grabbed his shotgun and walked out with heavy steps. I followed, carrying a flashlight. \"Stay behind me,\" he ordered, his eyes fixed on the darkness.\n\nThe dogs were circling the pigpen, their bodies tense as if facing something invisible. There was a metallic smell in the air — a mix of blood and damp earth. As we got closer, we saw the scene: one of the pigs was dead, thrown against the broken fence. Its skin had been torn off in patches, exposing its ribs. The eyes seemed to have been gouged out.\n\n\"Cougar,\" Dad said, but the word came out hesitant. I looked at him, noticing the doubt in his voice. \"Was it a cougar, Dad?\" I asked, my eyes wide. He didn’t answer right away. He inspected the surroundings, but there were no tracks, no clear signs of a struggle.\n\nBack inside, he reinforced the door locks and muttered to himself, \"Just an animal. I'll take care of it tomorrow.\" But deep down, something was bothering him. That strange smell, the silence that took over the forest after the barking stopped — it was as if the woods themselves were too scared to breathe.\n\nThat night, I had trouble sleeping. I woke up twice, swearing I heard something scratching at the wood outside. The second time, I tried to ignore it, but an inexplicable chill ran down my spine.\n\nDad didn’t sleep either. He stayed in the living room, shotgun within reach, listening to the generator’s intermittent hum outside. When the machine failed for the third time, he almost went to check it, but changed his mind. \"In the morning,\" he thought, as if making an empty promise.\n\nHe had no idea that dawn would bring more than just a simple generator repair. Something was lurking out there — something that wasn’t a cougar, or anything he could face alone.\n\nAnd it was just getting started.\n\nThe sun had barely risen when Dad went out. I followed, dragging my feet, still heavy from lack of sleep. The smell of the dead pig already filled the air — sour and nauseating. The fence was still broken, and the chickens wouldn’t stop clucking, restless, as if something was still prowling nearby.\n\n\"Go get the tarp from the shed,\" Dad told me, holding the flashlight. I hesitated, glancing at the forest around us, but obeyed. When I came back with the tarp, he had already dragged the pig out of the pen, trying to ignore the animal’s gruesome state.\n\nThe body was almost unrecognizable. The claw marks were deep and distorted, as if the creature that attacked it had inhuman strength. Dad tried to rationalize it. \"It was a cougar. It had to be a cougar.\" But the absence of tracks and the mysterious silence from the day before still unsettled him.\n\nWe wrapped the pig in the tarp and dragged it to a hole near the back fence where Dad usually buried dead animals. The work was slow and unpleasant, and even the crows that usually hovered around stayed away, as if sensing danger.\n\n\"Done. It's over,\" Dad said, wiping sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand. But he knew he was lying.\n\nThe rest of the day was filled with an uncomfortable silence. I tried to keep up with daily chores, but the tension in the air was palpable. \"Dad, are you going to leave the fence like that?\" I asked late in the afternoon, but he just shook his head.\n\n\"I'll take care of it tomorrow. I'll check the generator before dark,\" he replied, grabbing his tools from the shed. He spent the whole afternoon trying to get the damn motor running properly, but the problem seemed bigger than he thought. The gas can next to the cabinet remained untouched, but every time he passed by it, a strange unease climbed up his spine.\n\nThe sun began to set, painting the sky blood-red, and the tension on the farm only grew. I brought the dogs closer to the house and locked up the pigpen. \"Dad, can we go to bed early tonight?\" I asked as the lights started to flicker.\n\n\"Yeah, we are,\" he replied. But Dad had no intention of sleeping. Something inside him screamed that the night would bring worse problems than a broken generator.\n\nWhile we were having dinner, the dogs started barking again. This time, it wasn’t just a warning — it was pure terror. Dad stood up, grabbed his shotgun, and looked at me. \"Stay inside.\"\n\"But what about you, Dad?\" I asked, clutching his arm tightly.\n\"I'll be right back. I just need to see what it is.\"\n\nBut deep down, he knew he wasn’t ready for what awaited him outside. The night was alive, breathing through the house like a beast stalking its prey. And it hadn’t shown its teeth yet.\n\nWhen he went out, the sight was horrifying: two of the dogs were dead, their bodies twisted at impossible angles, as if crushed by something monstrous. The third was barking at the darkness but suddenly fell silent, letting out a final agonized yelp before being dragged into the woods.\n\nDad smelled it. It wasn’t just blood — it was something deeper, like rotten flesh mixed with sulfur. He pointed his flashlight at the trees, and what he saw made his blood run cold: glowing yellow eyes, burning like embers.\n\n\"Who's there?!\" he shouted, his voice betraying his fear. The answer came as a guttural growl, a sound that seemed to vibrate through the very ground. Then, a figure emerged. It wasn’t a man, nor an animal. It was something in between, with deformed muscles and black fur that seemed to pulse. Its long, filthy claws gleamed under the weak beam of the flashlight.\n\nThe creature lunged with impossible speed. Dad fired. The shot echoed through the night, but the monster didn’t stop. The impact only seemed to enrage it. It knocked him to the ground with a brutal blow, his shotgun flying out of reach. As he tried to get up, he saw the creature tearing into one of the dogs like it was just a snack.\n\nInside the house, I heard my father's screams and started praying, but I knew prayers wouldn’t be enough. I grabbed the machete Dad kept behind the door, my heart pounding as heavy footsteps approached.\n\nThe door burst inward, and the creature entered, its eyes locked onto me. I screamed, terrified, but didn’t back down. As the monster lunged, I swung with all my strength, striking its face. A horrible howl filled the air, but the machete got stuck in its thick flesh.\n\nDad, wounded, crawled to the door and saw the scene: I was struggling while the monster gripped my arm, lifting me like a rag doll. \"Let go of my daughter, you bastard!\" Dad grabbed the gasoline can with trembling hands and doused the creature before striking a match.\n\nThe fire engulfed the monster, which thrashed in agony, dropping me. The smell of burning flesh was nauseating, but even in flames, the creature didn’t die. With a final roar, it ran into the woods, disappearing into the darkness.\n\nWe survived, but we didn’t come out unscathed. My father lost his right arm that night, and I was left with scars that will never fade. Despite everything, we decided to stay on the farm. We reinforced the fences, took turns keeping watch, and always kept our weapons close.\n\nBut the howl of that creature still echoes in my nightmares. I know it’s not dead.\nI know one day it will come back to finish what it started.\nAnd all we can do is be ready to face it."},"59":{"title":"I Found Glowing Mushrooms on My Run [Part 1]","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k9ph04\/i_found_glowing_mushrooms_on_my_run_part_1\/","flair":"Series","author":"YogurtclosetTrick649","selftext":"I’ve always loved running in spring. April in my new town—a quiet place on the city’s edge, where rent’s cheap and farmlands stretch behind my house—was perfect for it. After weeks of chilly rain and clouds, the forecast finally promised clear skies, warm air, and blooming flowers along the jogging trails. It was Sunday, and I’d slept like a rock, dreaming of the crisp morning air I’d breathe on my run. My route was set: a trail through the fields to a small hill with a tulip garden at the top, where I’d snap a photo of the city skyline for Instagram.\n\nThe morning was everything I’d hoped. Sunlight spilled over lush green trees, and the flowers—reds, golds, purples—lined the path like a welcome mat. My shoes scraped rhythmically against the dirt trail, blending with birdsong and the rustle of leaves in the breeze. Each breath fueled my lungs, my pace quickening as I hit my stride. I felt alive, unstoppable, as I started the incline toward the hilltop.\n\nThen things got… wrong. A dense fog rolled in, swallowing the clear sky. Strange for such a small hill—too low for altitude to shift the weather like that. The air turned chilly, not frigid, but enough to prickle my skin through my shorts and tee. I shivered, chalking it up to clouds blocking the sun, and pushed upward. My breath puffed white, and the trail seemed to narrow, the flowers fading into gray mist.\n\nWhen I reached the hilltop, the skyline was gone, drowned in fog. So much for my photo. But that wasn’t what made my throat tighten until it ached. The tulip garden was obliterated—not trampled, but burst apart, as if something had erupted from the soil itself.\n\nIn the center stood a clump of… mushrooms, I guess you’d call them, but nothing like any I’d seen. They sprouted from a gnarled, ginger-like stump, surrounded by dozens of fan-shaped caps, broad as dinner plates. Their surfaces were moldy, brownish green with black patches that seemed to writhe in the dim light. The caps’ gills pulsed with a glow—not steady, but flowing, like bioluminescent veins tracing paths from stump to tip. It reminded me of deep-sea creatures, alien and wrong on dry land. The air around them hummed, low and unsteady, like a distant engine.\n\nI should’ve turned back. But I couldn’t look away. My hands shook as I pulled out my phone and opened Google Lens, hoping for answers. Nothing. No Wikipedia, no images, no articles. Just one link, buried deep in the results. Curiosity got the better of me, and I clicked.\n\nMy browser flashed a warning: “This site’s security certificate is not trusted!” The red screen screamed at me to stop, but the mushrooms’ glow seemed to pulse in time with my heartbeat, urging me on. I clicked “Proceed Anyway,” half-expecting a virus. What loaded was… underwhelming. A barebones page, like something from the early internet, with a grainy photo of the same fungal clump and a single sentence:\n\n*“Regarded by forgotten circles as a bearer of fortune; its presence said to soothe restless minds.”*\n\nI paused to check the name of the webpage. It read – *“the mycorrhizal network”*\n\nI was not a believer in charms and trinkets. Neither was I convinced that having a bunch of mushrooms at home would in some way magically lower one’s stress. Yet, I felt that something as unique as this should adorn my shelf and I did however, like having plants at home. Luckily, I always carried a pouch strapped to my belly during my runs for some emergency rehydration. So I reached out to grab a stub from the ginger-like stem, which had a handful of mushrooms. A sharp sting prickled my fingertips when I first touched it, although the touch was light, it felt as if the stub itself was piercing me.\n\nI looked at my hand again and swear I saw faint white lines forming under my skin, merging with the veins throbbing out due to the exertion. I quickly wiped my forehead with my sleeve and looked back again. Nothing. Strange I thought, but I managed to break a stub with a handful of mushrooms and put them in my pouch.\n\nThe run home was uneventful, the fog lifting as I descended, the sun returning like nothing had happened. Back at my place, I planted the stub in an empty pot, its faint glow casting shadows on my bedroom wall. I told myself it was just a cool plant, something to show off to friends. I showered, headed into the city to meet up with them, and stumbled home late, a little drunk and exhausted. Work-from-home Monday meant I could sleep in, but I needed rest. As I crawled into bed, I glanced at the pot. The mushrooms looked bigger, their caps spreading like fingers, but I blamed the alcohol and passed out.\n\nI woke up in a cold sweat, so parched that my throat was hurting. My tongue felt strange — rough and dry, as if a thin film had coated it overnight. My legs felt heavy, almost...rooted. When I swung them over the bed, it was as if something was tugging back, trying to keep me lying down. I swallowed some saliva to ease the pain as I check my smart watch. It was 5:50 am, still 90 minutes for my alarm to go off. But what woke me up was the dream I had. I call it a dream because I slept and woke up exactly at the same place, so whatever transpired in between must have been whatever my mind imagined in my slumber, right? Because, what I saw, rather felt, no, *rather lived*, seemed so existent, that it could hardly be classified as a dream. It was a sensory experience, as if I was transported to a different world whilst my body slept in the world I know of.\n\nIt was the dream-world itself, which was the most surreal part of this experience. I was transported into a world full of fungi I got back with me from the hilltop. Only here, the fungi were giant versions of these. As tall as the tallest trees on earth. And as I walked, my legs seemed to stick to the ground at every step, as if I was walking on glue. The ground was moldy, of the same color as the ginger-like stump I saw the other day. The air was thick, humid and warm, like stepping into a greenhouse. But the smell was nothing like one. It smelled horrible, like a dozen corpses rotting in the summer heat. I lifted my hand to cover my nose. And found I had none.\n\nI saw my hands; they were no loner the limbs of a human but fan-like caps of those strange fungi. They had their own gills. The pulsating glowing path, same as those mushrooms I got, same as the giant tree like counterparts in this world, was also present on my hands. I was horrified at the absence of my nose and the presence of sense of smell at the same time. I tried to scream in horror, but I couldn’t. I lowered my hand to where my mouth should have been, but I had no mouth as well.\n\nI raised my hands to feel my head. I could only feel a giant mushroom cap, oyster shaped, with long, thick gills running over what should be ma face and neck, all over my body. How I could see, I do not know, but surely, I was able to see and experience all that was going on around me.\n\nI could also feel, because I felt tiny droplets of rain falling on my body. As I looked up, I saw that these droplets were not falling from the sky, but from the giant mushrooms. They were small, almost miniscule, but visible, bright glowing. They were all over the place, as far as my “eyes” could see”. I looked around, trying to catch my bearings, of where I was, what was around me.\n\nThen I saw, hundreds, if not thousands, of “beings”. Similar to me. Human-sized, glowing oyster mushrooms. Just like me, most of them were looking aimlessly, towards the giant mushrooms. Some were more focused, walking the best they could on the slimy, sticky floor, towards something, or someone. And some, which I could only make out as “beings” because they moved their mushroom limbs from time to time, were fixated on the ground, immobile, appearing more “mushroom” than all the others. But all of them, all of us, looked up towards the giant mushrooms when they rained their spores on us."},"60":{"title":"I'm trapped on the edge of an abyss.

Back in our world.\n\nIt was black like the abyss, the sky a murky shroud of shadow. The sand beneath my feet was obsidian. Tiny, glittering grains that whispered their soft song as it shifted and slid with the wind. The gusts blew hard into my face, the tiny stones it carried stinging my cheeks as I tried to block it with my arm. I couldn’t see much around me; maybe 10 feet or so.\n\nI could hear though.\n\nOn the wind came another sound. Soft whispers that I could barely make out. They rode the bellows in confusing patterns, making me unsure exactly of their origin, but as I focused, I pinned it somewhere in front of me. I was so scared that I couldn’t move, and this was only made worse when another sound joined in. Heavy, slow steps pounding into the dunes. Something circling me just out of sight.\n\n“It’s infinite…” I picked out from the chorus of whispers around me. It sounded tired and pained, “All the filth that trickles down…”\n\nEach of the steps was scored by a dreadful cracking sound, like tree branches being ripped apart in a storm. I remember thinking that the only thing it could be was its limbs, but if that was the case, there was no way they weren’t broken to all hell.\n\nThe beast in the dark moved closer and closer, but I still couldn’t bring myself to move.\n\n“This place is deeper than hell,” a whisper sobbed with shaky breath,\n\n“It only goes deeper…” another returned.\n\nIt was right in front of me now, just barely shrouded by the veil of my vision. I held my breath and shook in place, nearly falling over under the weight of the winds, but I was too stiff to allow even that to happen. My brain screamed at me to move, but it was only a dream, and I was at the mercy of its plot.\n\nI barely caught a glimpse of something large, smooth, and ivory as it began to pierce through the contrasting shadow. Before I could make out what it was or anything about its form, I woke up.\n\nI really didn’t know where else to put that story, but it seems important, so I needed to get it down somewhere…\n\nOn a less intense note, Hope is undoubtedly me, but I’m starting to see some differences.\n\nFirst of all, she’s decidedly more optimistic about everything than I am. Ever since that moment she chose her new name, she practically shook the darkness of this place off her shoulders. She barely seems on edge like I am all the time, or if she is, she’s just better at hiding it. While I have been mostly silent and stoic, still not used to having a new face around, she offers me a smile pretty much anytime we make eye contact.\n\nThe main thing that made me notice all of this was when I made a self-deprecating joke to her to break the ice. I don’t even remember what it was because I was so caught off guard by her response.\n\n“Hey, don’t talk like that!” She scolded gently, “You’re great. We’ll, I guess *we’re* great, I should say.”\n\nThat was odd. Like, really odd. I think I’ve mentioned that I don’t have a very high opinion of myself, so the fact that my exact copy was saying she thought I was cool felt odd. The fact that she wasn’t even saying it to justify herself was weirder.\n\nAll of this may sound like I’m seeing these things as red flags, but it’s not quite that. It’s not like she’s freaking me out or acting suspicious by being nice. I guess it’s just that I haven’t really seen a version of myself like that in a long time. Maybe she was right when she said that we’d have different perspectives on things.\n\nIt makes me wonder what about her is so different from me. If she came straight out of my body with all my thoughts and memories, you’d think she’d have an even worse view of things having been dumped here so abruptly. Whatever the case, that mystery is on the back burner for now. We’ve got bigger beasts to report here.\n\nAfter my last post, we headed up to the radio room to take a look around again, this time with an actual flashlight. Hope had the same reaction I did to the rancid smell of rot in the room, though I tried to warn her.\n\n“Wow,” she choked out, “You weren’t joking.”\n\n“Yeah,” I said back, using the hood of my jacket as a mask, “The um… body is behind the desk over there. That’s where I found the laptop.”\n\n“How long do you think it’s been in here?” She asked, “If it smells that bad, then it has to have been a while.”\n\n“Maybe,” I told her, “Although, everything in this place is rotted to all hell. I’m curious if time works normally here.”\n\n“I guess that wouldn’t be too out of character for it.”\n\nArmed with my phone this time, there was a lot of detail that I had missed my first trip through. For starters, it was trashed way more than I could originally see, but I don’t mean that in the way that the town is falling apart. Most of the equipment up here was actually new and lacked the distinct dust and mold that everything else was painted with. It was smashed to pieces though, like something tore through and took the furniture with it. I had a feeling it was the same thing that had left the pair of legs behind.\n\nWhatever this place was, it was clearly the Kingfisher team’s area of operation. The massive server obelisk that still hummed in the center of the room was also hooked up to more than just the radio tower. There was a whole nest of cables that ran across various corners of the ceiling and into the walls. I followed one that looked like it ran to a window, and following it outside, I could see that it connected to the town’s power lines and ran off into the dark. I wondered if all the other wires did the same.\n\n“Hey, Hen, look at this,” Hope called to me from across the room, an undercut of curiosity to her tone.\n\nI turned to see her standing across the space near the station's recording booth, a wall of monitors and computer stations set up before her. They all looked to be set up by our scientist friends, and one of the larger screens was glowing with power.\n\n“How’d you get that running?” I asked, moving to join her.\n\n“It was already on; I just pressed a button on the board here.” She informed.\n\nThe monitor was clearly different from the numerous ones next to it. While those looked to be surveillance monitors (Confirming my theory that we may be being watched), this one was just one large CRT screen attached to a confusing looking control board. On it were a collection of red lines, boxes, and symbols that made no sense to me at first. The more I studied them, however, the clearer it became.\n\nIt was a map of the shelf. I could clearly make out the jagged, almond shape of the plateau, and I could parse which side was the cliff face, and the drop into the abyss. A lot of the buildings around the main street of town were accounted for, including the motel, and in front of that, they even had what I assumed to be the vending machines marked. They were represented by a series of three rippling circles, and, text beneath them read ‘*research point A’*.\n\n“Looks like they were a mystery to them just as much as they were to me,” I muttered aloud.\n\n“What do you think these are?” Hope asked, pointing to another symbol on the chart.\n\nThere were plenty more. The giant metal door was marked by a triangle that read *‘Kingfisher Main’*, and behind it, we got an idea of what might be waiting.\n\nDotted outlines of a large space appeared back there; a whole facility a fraction the size of the town. A spot of note in there was an area labeled, *‘imprint processing’,* mirroring the deposit hatch I’d seen by the door, but there was also a stranger one.\n\nIt was a circle with a line beneath it, almost like an omega symbol, and it simply read *‘the drill.’*\n\nThose weren’t what Hope was pointing to, though. She was pointing out one of numerous spots on the map that read ‘*Rig 1, Rig 2, Rig 3,*’ and *‘Rig 4’.* They were all represented by a rectangle that flashed solid, then outlined repeatedly. All four of them, each positioned in a different corner of the shelf, had the same words beneath them.\n\n*‘Cell loaded; Malfunction detected’*\n\n“I have no idea…” I said with a furrowed brow, finally answering my clone’s question, “Whatever they are, though, they don’t look like they’re going to be much help to us,” I continued, tapping the malfunction box.\n\n“Those might, though,” Hope noted, pointing to one of the numerous red dots scattered across the map. There had to be over three dozen of them, all in random locations, and while they weren’t labeled on their own, they did appear to have text linked to them. In the top corner of the screen in big letters that flashed to the same tempo as the dots, the words, *‘Imprints Detected’* burned against our skin with its glow.\n\n“That word was on a hatch near the door where I woke up,” Hope said.\n\n“I saw it too,” I nodded in agreement.\n\n“What do you think they are?” She asked, “If we take one to that hatch, maybe something will happen that’ll give us some clues on how to get the door open?”\n\n“We can find out right now,” I told her, tapping on the glass. The radio station also had an icon of its own—a simplified version of its prominent tower—and overlapping it was one of the dots. “There’s one here.”\n\nHope turned and looked around the space, “Well, what do you think an ‘imprint’ is? I suppose we need to know that to figure out what we’re looking for…”\n\nStepping away from the monitor, I began looking myself. There wasn’t anything in the space other than the kingfisher equipment that looked out of place, so I couldn’t tell for sure. I pinned it up in my memory as I kept searching the rest of the area, hoping that it might reveal itself the more I dug around.\n\nDespite how long I’d put it off for, I knew that I needed to return to the desk that I’d found the laptop from. I still needed a password, and though I hadn’t seen one upon first inspection, I didn’t exactly look very hard the first time, and my mind had been elsewhere.\n\nGingerly, I moved toward the lonely pair of legs, trying my hardest to avoid the sticky puddle of blood left in their wake. It was a fruitless effort.\n\nWhen I reached the desk and shined my light on it, however, I was very glad I’d come back to look. I hadn’t seen it the first time because the laptop was resting atop it, but there actually was a note left behind.\n\nBlood spattered its surface and had soaked its edges from pooling under the laptop, but luckily, it was still legible. Unluckily, it was not a password, and even worse, what it read made me nauseous all over again. \n\nHope must have seen my expression in the afterglow of my light, because she moved closer to me, a look of concern on her face, “What? What is it?”\n\nMy eyes kept scanning the note, feeling worse with each passing sentence.\n\n“Hensley? What is it? What does it say?”\n\nLooking up at her, I swallowed, then took it from the top.\n\n“Brand,” It began, “I don’t know where you are, but I pray that you’re just hiding somewhere because you couldn’t make it back to the tower in time. Please, please, please, let this be the case. You’re all that I have left now.”\n\n“Poor guy,” Hope muttered, looking at the body, then quickly regretting the decision.\n\nI carried on, “Shae may have fucked us, but we might still a have a shot. That thing destroyed most of the equipment here during its first time around, but I managed to at least fix the tracker and reconnect it to the tower. Now, the bad news is, I don’t know if there’s enough imprints around town to get us home, but the good news is the rigs are all still fully charged. There’s more bad news, though.  They’re malfunctioning for some reason. If we can get them up and running again, we might be able to power the drill long enough to punch a hole back home.”\n\nAs I read, I could tell Hope was deep in thought, and while I continued, she moved over to the map again to plot things out.\n\n“It’s a long shot, and I know we lost a lot of people the first time around trying to get them back online, but that was with Shae at the helm, and clearly, he didn’t have our best interests in mind. Admittedly, I’ve never even seen the inside of a rig in person, but if it’s anything like our tech out here, I’m sure I can find a way to fix it up. I’m going to head out to the first location to see if I can’t work it out. I hope that you’ll be back by the time I return. I *need* you back by the time I return. Signed, Juarez.”\n\nHope, who’d had her face buried in the map since she’d walked over there, finally pulled away to look at me, raising a brow, “That’s… not that bad. If anything, that’s good news! We have a concrete way of how to get out of here! Course’ we still need the door code and to figure out how to fix—”\n\n“That’s… not all,” I cut ‘myself’ off, not wanting to get her hopes up, “He um… must have come back because everything I just read is scribbled out. He wrote another message beneath it.”\n\nConcern blossomed on Hope’s face, and she shook her head, “What does it say?”\n\nSwallowing hard, I read it, “Forget it. You’re dead. I’m dead. Everyone’s dead, and it’s what we deserve. I didn’t know. I swear I didn’t know what we were doing here. Shae, he lied to us. He lied to us all. Maybe there was a chance of escape, but even if there were, I can’t live with myself now. I’m waiting here until that thing comes back. I’d just end it myself, but I’m more afraid of what might be waiting for me in hell. Maybe being a part of its form will be a fate less wretched. I’m sorry, God. I’m so, so sorry.”\n\n Hope looked like she wasn’t breathing, and I was having a hard time doing so myself. We just stared at each other for an eternity, our imaginations like wildfire about what that note could possibly mean. The more I thought, though, the more despair came to coil around me.\n\nSensing this, Hope cleared her throat and spoke to distract me, “Hey, um, this room seems important. If we’re going to be up here a lot, do you think we should…?” She asked, pointing to Juarez’s legs.\n\nI eyed them vacantly, forcing myself to detach, then nodded.\n\nBodies are heavier than you’d expect them to be. Even half of one. It makes sense in hindsight; most people weigh over 100 pounds, but still, looking at something so still and lifeless makes it feel off. Knowing that it once belonged to a living being makes it seem like it should weigh less or something. As if the soul that left it was where the real heft was at.\n\nHope and I tried not to think about things too much as we grabbed the shoes of the rotting limbs and hauled it onto some long window curtains we’d found next door. Juarez’s cold, rotting flesh peeled off the vinyl with a sick squelching crackle, and a black sludge oozed from the folds of his stomach. It was all both us had to not puke.\n\n Ungracefully rolling him up, we each grabbed an end of the coffin hammock, then started out of the room. Heading out the front doors of the station, we moved for a back alley across the street. It felt a little ungraceful leaving a dead man's legs in a dank, decrepit alley, but it was really the only place we could think that would be out of sight and mind. It seemed better than just tossing it over the edge into the abyss, and besides, neither of us were really too keen on going near that ledge.\n\nMy frail, aching bones were sore by the time we set the now bloodied and rancid drapes behind a dumpster, then Hope and I looked at one another.\n\n“So, what now?” She asked, “What’s the game plan? Do we want to go see what those imprint things are? It seems like our only lead.”\n\nI bit my cheek and nodded, finally tearing my gaze free of the bloody wad we’d just left on the pavement, “Yeah. I suppose.”\n\n“You okay?” Hope asked softly.\n\nI turned to face her, “Yeah, sorry. I’m just curious about what he saw at those rigs that drove him to well… that.”\n\nHope smiled, “Well, let’s not concern ourselves with those, okay? That note said that those imprint things can get us home if there’s enough of them.”\n\n“Yeah, but he said there *wasn’t* enough…”\n\n“Well, maybe, but who knows how long ago that was written? Whatever they are, there could be more that have popped up since then. Obviously, they were tracking them on that map for a reason. It was probably to see when more were found.”\n\nThat actually made a strange amount of sense, and I was a little impressed that an offshoot of me was being so savvy about all of this. I had barely pieced together anything yet.\n\n“How are you being so optimistic?” I asked her.\n\nShe just shrugged, “What’s pessimism going to do for us in a time like this?” moving toward me, she patted my arm and spun me around confidently, “C’mon! Let’s go check that map again and get a few locations down.”\n\nWe moved back up to the station's top floor, Hope leading the way while I kept my eye on the tower light. I’ve noticed that creatures seem to space themselves a bit after one shows up, but that’s not necessarily a guarantee.\n\nThe room smelled marginally better already, but marginally really is the keyword there. Hope and I sucked it up, returning to the imprint monitor, but when we reached it and looked down at the chart again, something caught our eyes.\n\n“Wait a minute,” my clone said, “Where’d the one that was at the station go?”\n\nShe was right. The dot that was positioned directly on the tower was now missing.\n\n“Do you think these things, like, disappear or something?” Hope cocked her head at me.\n\nI just shook my own, furrowing my brow down at the screen and searching for any information that might help answer her question. That’s when I noticed a new dot, however. One close to the station while all the other ones had been at least a block or two away. It was parked just across the street from us, tucked between two boxes on the map that marked buildings.\n\n“What the…” I muttered, snapping my head to the window to confirm a quickly brewing theory.\n\n“What? What is it?” Hope asked.\n\nSure enough. If I was looking in the right spot, then…\n\nI pointed to the speck, then looked at my friend, “Hope, isn’t this where we *just* put Juarez…”\n\nI saw the color drain her face as it dawned on her too, “Wait… yeah. Yeah, it is.”\n\nSuddenly, the red glow from the map on our faces felt much more sinister.\n\n“You don’t think that… all of these dots are…?” Hope began slowly.\n\nI swallowed hard, “I don’t know. I haven’t explored this place enough.”\n\nHope chewed her cheek, shaking her head, “I don’t understand why they’d call them imprints. I don’t get what they were doing here.”\n\n“Me either,” I told her, grabbing a piece of paper from the desk next to us. Snagging a pen too, I placed it over the screen by the radio tower, then started tracing, marking any dots I could see, “But there’s only one way to know if that’s what these things really are.”\n\nFor a fleeting moment, traveling outside a few minutes ago had felt somewhat safe. We knew the rhythm of this place; so long as the light was off, we were in the clear. Now though, walking through the endless dark knowing that this town might just be one big graveyard? Well, the thought of rotting corpses being hidden in every cranny of this place wasn’t exactly a reassuring one.\n\nThe nearest dot was a small grocery store on the main street, just across the road from the gas station. Hope and I eyed the wall of cold, black windows with a shudder before moving for the door. They were automatic sliding ones that were shut, but that didn’t matter. They were already shattered to pieces.\n\nThe store smelled rancid and noxious, and I felt like each breath was slowly shaving minutes off my already shortened life. Rotting food and moldy surfaces painted everything like a putrid collage, and the rusty metal shelves creaked and groaned softly, as if we were waking this place from a long nap.\n\nOn the terminal, the dot looked like it was near the back of the building, so hope and I began making our way there. My heart matched my footsteps as we moved, slow and steady, and I hoped deeply that what we were about to find wasn’t actually going to be a corpse.\n\nI knew the light wasn’t on when we had entered this place, so we were theoretically safe, but still, I couldn’t see the tower anymore, which I really wasn’t a fan of.\n\nAs we came to the back corner of the store where a meat deli was, the smell was unbearable. Viscous decayed sludge was behind the display glass, but the scent was more than just the rotten cuts. It was a familiar one that we’d gotten accustomed to back at the radio tower.\n\nHope and I rounded the counter, and my throat tightened. Splayed out on the tile, a body lay, limbs frozen in clawing agony. Their face was a frozen scream, and their eyes empty sockets where orbs had melted away. There wasn’t any gore, no blood to be found, but I took no solace in that fact. The implications of their death were far, far worse.\n\nTheir skin was gaunt and grey, shriveled to their bones like somebody paper mache’d a skeleton. There was nothing left inside the corpse, and it was clear to see why.\n\nI don’t have trypophobia—the fear of clusters of holes—but seeing it on a body is a different experience.\n\nHundreds of thousands of tiny punctures littered every inch of the victim's skin, even peppering through their clothes. The edges of each one were highlighted with a ring of dark red blood that had escaped whatever tube had slurped it out. The body almost looked like a giant wasps nest now, and all hope and I could do was stare in horror.\n\n“Hensley, I really don’t want to die in this place…” was all she could say.\n\nI agreed whole heartedly.\n\nSwallowing, I spoke sickly, “I guess that confirms it. Imprints are definitely bodies.”\n\n“Why the hell were they collecting them?” hope shook her head, “And how are they supposed to help us get home?”\n\n“I have no idea,” I told her, shaking my head, “But if this is what they were doing in this place, then I’m not sure throwing them down that chute is a good idea. We don’t really know what could happen.”\n\nI could tell hope agreed with me, but she made a very good point as she turned to me with a tragic look, “Do we really have any other options?”\n\nWe used a shopping cart to move the body this time. It took a while for me and myself to get the courage to even touch the thing, afraid that it might spring back to life or that some sort of insect swarm might be living inside. With all the things I’ve heard while living here, I really don’t know what to expect anymore.\n\nOnce again, my eyes were glued on the radio tower as we moved through the street, more hurriedly this time. I was especially more on edge since we were wheeling a giant metal cage that rattled and squeaked into the silent air as we moved across the bumpy asphalt.\n\nHope was the one who volunteered to push while I kept a sharp lookout on the tower, and though she now had the flashlight to light the way ahead, I was still making sure to listen out for anything past the cart’s rattling. There was a chance that I might hear a beast shrieking as it scaled the cliffs up to us before the tower even lit up.\n\nThat intense focus is what helped me to hear the whispers.\n\nI shot my arm out and grabbed Hope, freezing her in place while my head went on a pivot. When I saw nothing, I snapped my head up to the tower, but the light was still asleep. Even so, it was unmistakable; I heard something talking. Murmuring in the streets around us.\n\nThis was before I’d had the dream I mentioned earlier, otherwise I might have gone full panic mode. They weren’t really whispers, though. It sounded more like a recording of somebody speaking normally, but playing at a very low volume. I noticed it was coming from behind me, so I spun on my heels, reaching for Hope's hand and wrenching the flashlight within it toward the dark. There was nothing there, however.\n\nIt was around that time that she heard it too, “What… what is that?” She asked barely above a whisper.\n\nI furrowed my brow in confusion, trying to decide if it’d be safer to run, or hold our ground for more clues. The sound was still so hard to make out; no words that came through clear enough for me to hear. There was a sudden sound, however, that was unmistakable. A laugh, sudden and loud, making me jump.\n\nIt wasn’t because it was scary, it was just the suddenness of it that had jarred me. In contrast, the chuckle sounded genuine. Warm and filled with joy. It was also so loud and stark to everything else, that I finally pieced together where it was coming from.\n\nMy eyes fell toward the hollow body, crumpled in the cart.\n\nInstantly, I grabbed Hope and tugged her back, breathing shallow so that I could hear more of the sound emanating from the corpse. Eventually, she did the same, both of us attempting to figure out what the hell was going on.\n\nThe body didn’t move, though. It didn’t sit up and start clambering toward us. It just continued to lay still while recordings echoed from its many holes.\n\n“Is there something still in there,” Hope whispered, “There’s no way it’s still alive, right?”\n\nCautiously, I took a step closer, the other me still gripping my arm tightly, just in case. The laughing had stopped, and the noise was back to its original chatter, but in the silence, I could finally make out its sound.\n\n“I love you,” I heard a feminine voice say with adoration dripping from her tone.\n\n“I love you too,” a man said back.\n\nThen music began to ring out at that same, low volume. It was something slow and romantic, wailing somberly into the streets. I continued to hear voices and shuffling in the background, but couldn’t discern what they were saying through the noise.\n\nShaking my head, I said, “Hope… I think the noise *is* the body.”\n\nShe rejoined me by the cart's side, “What the… how is it doing that?”\n\nI shrugged, “I’m not sure.”\n\nAfter a long beat of listening, the two of us indulging in more of the oddity, hope finally spoke again, softly and curiously.\n\n“Imprints…”\n\nLeaving us both to chew on what that meant, she gingerly grabbed the handle, then turned to me, “Should we, um…?”\n\nI nodded, not peeling my eyes from the talking husk, “Yeah. Let’s go.”\n\nThe rest of the walk to the cliff door was a little more somber, the both of us carrying more than  just the weight of the body. Hope was probably right; more imprints had ‘appeared’ since that note was made. The problem was that imprints were bodies, and if more bodies appeared, than that meant they were probably just poor, innocent souls that stumbled into this place like us. People who got lost here and never found the towers refuge in time…\n\nThere was more weight than that, though. The term ‘imprint’ combined with the noise from the corpse told a chilling story. Something about this place was taking part of people with them when they died. Hell, the fact that it was a lovely town in the real world, but a dead, decaying place on the other side made me wonder if it was making imprints of more than just ‘organic’ things.\n\nObviously the people here were fascinated by the concept as well, and thought it could lead to… well, *something.* That part I’m still trying to figure out.\n\nI can’t help but think about the end of Juarez’s note, though.\n\n*‘I swear I didn’t know what we were doing here… Shae lied to us… I can’t live with myself…’*\n\nI really hope that the extent of that was these bodies, and there isn’t more horrific secrets waiting around the bend.\n\nHope and I finally reached the hatch, then looked at each other before creaking it open. The pungent smell of death began wafting up from its depths, and my stomach did somersaults as I finally had to confront what we were about to do.\n\nHope could see it on my face, “Are… you okay with this?” she asked.\n\nI swallowed and eyed the body, “Like you said earlier. What other choice do we have?”\n\nHope nodded, then together, we grabbed each side of the body and lifted it out.\n\nIt was a bit of a struggle to untangle the thing from the cart, then get it hoisted onto the lip of the hatch door. Once it was up, the two of us listened to its somber melodies one last time before giving it a final shove, sending it tumbling into the dark below.\n\n*Thunk thud thump!*\n\nDown it went, deep into the depths, bouncing off the unforgiving shaft walls all the way. Hope and I waited one minute, then two, our eyes locked on each other as we listened. Nothing seemed to be happening at first, but after a beat of silence, a noise returned up the shaft.\n\nA low, ominous rumble. Large metallic parts whirling and clanging deep below.\n\nWe listened carefully for around 3 minutes until it finally stopped, and then, the air went back to its quiet, unliving drone.\n\nI stepped back and took it all in, wondering if I’d missed something, but no. nothing about the door, nor the hatch had changed or shifted in anyway. Well, almost none of it.\n\nI zeroed in on the small gauge to the side of the hatch marked by the amber LED’s, noticing that it was now different. Where as one row had been lit up before, there was now two. That might have been encouraging, knowing that we’d actually just made something happen, but the issue was that there were still hundreds of tiny bars still dark. The gauge was massive, and we’d just put a drop into a very large bucket.\n\nWithdrawing the copy of the map I’d made from my pocket, I began counting the dots, my heart sinking the closer I got to the end. There were more on the screen back at the station that I couldn’t fit, but even factoring in an extra couple dozen, there was no way we were even close to filling the meter. Not if it was only enough to fill one bar at a time.\n\nOn top of that, even if we filled it, there was no guarantee that it would even do anything. The note said that it could power something to get us home, but *we* didn’t know how to operate it, and besides, we still needed the code to the door to even get inside. Once again, the tide of hope in my heart began to recede.\n\nIt’s a good thing my clone had picked a fitting name.\n\n“That’s okay,” she nodded confidently, looking at the meter, “We still got a bunch more to go. Who knows, maybe some of them will have more, um… ‘juice’ than others.”\n\nI shook my head, “Hope, what do we even do once we fill it?”\n\n“I don’t know, but we’ll cross that bridge when we get there. It’s better than just sitting around and waiting to become and imprint ourselves, right?” she smiled.\n\nI looked to the side with a frown, unsure about everything.\n\nHer smile began to melt and match mine, “Look, I know the odds are that we die here. I’m being optimistic, but I’m not naïve. But we can’t just give up. Not when Trevor and Dad are still waiting for us back home. We can’t leave Dad alone—not after mom—and we can’t die with the last thing we said to Trevor being… well, you know.”\n\nHer words stung my heart to hear, guilt bubbling up into my chest, but she still had a point. I had amends to make back home, and the only thing that scared me more than the creatures out here was dying without getting to see my family one last time.\n\nLooking back, I couldn’t believe I had started my road trip in the first place with that very idea in mind…\n\nI looked to hope and nodded, returning her soft smile, “Right. Let’s head back to the station and get a solid plan laid out. We don’t want to be in the streets when something shows up again, and we’ve already been out here a while.”\n\nShe nodded in affirmation.\n\nI couldn’t help but laugh and shake my head as she pulled her coat farther onto her shoulders.\n\n“What?” she asked, cocking her head in confusion.\n\n“Nothing,” I told her, “I just don’t think I’m ever going to get used to talking to myself.”\n\n“Oh, whatever,” she giggled back, “We talked to ourselves all the time. The only difference now is that we don’t have to look in a mirror to do it.”\n\nWe decided to bring the cart back to the station with us for future use, but agreed that we might need to make some modifications or find something else in the future. That body had been light as it was… well… *empty.* But future ones were going to be harder to haul, and trying to get them in and out of the cart was not easy. Plus, the thing was loud as hell, and we worried that it might attract much unwanted attention from below.\n\nWe were in the middle of discussing this when Hope suddenly trailed off, looking toward the north side of the plateau in confusion. I turned to check the tower for the fifth time in the last minute, but the light was still off, so that wasn’t her concern.\n\n“What’s up?” I asked in a whisper.\n\n“Was it always that bright over there?” She asked.\n\nI looked off toward where she was directing and saw clearly what she meant. Over the buildings and houses, there was a large swath of the abyssal sky that was being scared off by copious amounts of light. Considering this place had been pitch black aside from the door and the tower, I could confidently say that it was new.\n\nMy heart started back to its new favorite rhythm.\n\nWe were close to the station, so we continued on until we reached the front door, then left the cart before cautiously starting toward main street. Based on where the lights were coming from, we should have been able to see their source down the road.\n\n“Do you think this is a trap?” Hope asked.\n\n“Maybe,” I told her, “Let’s just keep a safe distance.”\n\nSure enough, looking down the street, right next to the spot where the road abruptly dropped into the sea, I could see streetlights to an empty parking lot casting their beams onto the asphalt below. The weird thing was that even though I hadn’t spent much time over there, I was almost certain that there hadn’t been a parking lot. There had been a small business building, and the lights were definitely not on.\n\nSlowly, like moths drawn to flame, we kept creeping down the road, our curiosity getting the better of us. It wasn’t until we were right next to the motel that we could get a full view of the place, and what we saw made my blood run cold.\n\n“Oh my God…” Hope gasped breathlessly, “Is that—”\n\n“Yeah…” I muttered, dread pressing onto me like an ocean.\n\nA large parking lot filled with streetlights lay ahead with a massive building behind it. The structure was plain; mostly composed of grey painted bricks, but there were several neon tubes of light comprising a rainbow that ran the top perimeter of it. A sign near the double front doors said the name of the building, but it paled compared to the more extravagant one by the street.\n\nA colorful cartoon zebra smiled out at us, arms stretched in welcome, backlit by searing, florescent lights. Beneath him in colorful, bubbly letters were the words, ‘*Zane’s Jammin’ Jungle’.*\n\nThe location that Hope and I had a birthday when we were 7.\n\n“Why is that here?” She asked me, panic under her words, “H-Has that always been—”\n\n“No.” I answered sharply, my heart pounding.\n\nWe stared, positively transfixed by the building for a long time before I felt Hope grab my wrist, “Well, whatever it is, it can’t be good. Come on, let’s get back to the tower.”\n\nI resisted for the slightest moment, feeling inexplicably drawn to the place. I wanted to know why a random building from my youth was suddenly dropped into this horrible town. A place that was so far from my childhood innocence that it looped back around to being downright sinister seeing it perched on the edge of the abyss. I knew Hope was right, though. Nothing good could come of it, and charging in blind without a plan wasn’t going to end well.\n\nTogether, we made for the station.\n\nAnd that’s where we’ve been since. We’ve gone out for a few more bodies, but like the first, they don’t do much to fill the meter. They all sing and talk; all in different voices and songs. All of them just as mutilated as the last. We’re not sure what we’re achieving, but we haven’t really found any other clues to set us on another path.\n\nWell, I suppose that’s not true. We found one.\n\nUpon checking the map once more for dots, one of the rig statuses had changed. The one on the north side of town. The north side, right where Zane’s has appeared.\n\nIt now reads, *‘Cell Ready For Harvest; Malfunction detected’.*\n\nHope thinks we should ignore it, and I agree, but I think both of us know deep down that we’re not going to get anywhere else with this if we don’t eventually venture in there. Why else would something so prominently related to us appear out of thin air? This place is clearly all about imprints of the past, and if my past has started getting stitched into this hellscape of a town, then there must be answers there.\n\nWe also know that whatever is waiting there for us can’t be good, however, and I think that’s what scares us…\n\nJuarez wasn’t lying about damages to the equipment, and I suspect that might be what’s causing the signal interference. There’s a lot of cables ripped to pieces or servers that looks smashed. I’ll be the first to tell you that I know nothing about computers, but I found a closet full of spare chords and parts, and I’m going to attempt to swap a few out in my free time. I don’t know if it’ll help with anything, but at this point, I’m dying for outside contact.\n\nI guess more accurately, now more than ever, I need advice on what I should do. There’s gotta be puzzle pieces here that I’m not seeing, and I’m terrified that I might make a wrong step and get my selves killed. Here’s to hoping I can get it figure out…\n\nI’ll update you when I have more, but for now, thank you all for following along. It gives me more comfort than you can imagine to know that we're not entirely alone in all this, and that if we die, we aren't going to die unknown.\n\nBe back soon.

Not by choice– trust me, I may not fear many things but space is 90% of them so fuck it in its entirety. This one's gonna take a bit to finish. I’m still rusty at writing, writing these has gotten some of my mojo back, and I want to give you my best here. \n\n\n\nSomething had recently dawned on me. After posting the last part, I reread it to make sure I had spelled everything right and see if my grammar was in order– although I should, I don’t proofread– when I grazed over the last paragraph. I wrote it without thinking very much, just tossed the thought on the page. But, rereading it, it felt like someone standing in my ears screaming for attention. My dreams, the carousel of nightmares I had been living with since I was able to plunder REM. They were coming to life and dying by my hand. The gangly and inhuman humanoid at the foot of my bed, with me since 3, left after burning the corpse of the entity below my bed. Running across a lawn only to be caught and torn apart by snarling piles of shifting rotten meat but never dying, with me since 4, left after euthanizing the last Mockingbird. Sharpened branches plunging through my body as I crucified on a tree with fire roaring below encircled by figures, with me since 2, left after crushing the throat of the cult leader. \n\n\n\nThe nightmares I faced and conquered were the nightmares I conquered in my youth. Noticeably, one I had never gotten over was the same dream I had the night of my last post. \n\n\n\nFigures, thin and wrong, taking me from my bed and pulling me into the sky. Their slick skin holding me down as they peeled me open layer by layer, inspecting each carefully, only to be forced to repeat the filleting after the flesh grew back. My head was removed from my shoulders and awake to watch as they sampled me, refining their pallet. The worst part was they found me a delicacy. \n\n\n\nOf all my dreams, that one made my body soak with sweat and my heart sprint. Being enjoyed by another thing. Unfortunately, I’m too smart for my own good and understood what this meant. \n\n\n\n“Tony girl, eat up.” She still refused to eat the overpriced wet food, but was more than happy to inhale a bowl of ground beef. As she slobbered away, I readied my arsenal. \n\n\n\nHoney Lavender Shampoo, Mint Coat Oil, Coconut Paw Scrub, Peanut Butter Protective Toothpaste, Aloe Ear Lotion, and most dangerous of all, Doggie Soft Butt Wipes. Tony side eyed the empty room as she ate. Pulling away from her empty bowl to search the room. For upstairs she heard the faintest crinkle of a bag, her treat bag. Like a rocket she flew up the stairs and burst into the bathroom to see the bag balanced on the edge of the tub. She staked over to into and bumped the bag to the ground with her snoot. The door shut just as she realized the bag was empty.\n\n\n\n“It's the end of the line, pooch. You’re getting in that tub.” I clutched the shampoo tightly as Tony lowered her stance like she was ready to pounce. “Don’t try it. It won’t work this time.” She leapt at me, tongue first. My back slammed against the door and she licked my face. “Nope! No! You won’t win!” I swept her back legs and spun on to her back, picking her up and dropping her into the bathtub. I lathered her fur with shampoo as she mean-mugged me. I had to refill the water 5 times from the amount of blood and dirt in her coat. She didn’t protest for long and even fussed after I stopped scrubbing her paws with the purple solution.\n\n\n\nDrying her off was the next war I had to wage. I fought each of her attempts to shake and even employed a blow dryer to finish the job. “Good fight.” I shook her paw. “Here.” The Milk Bone barely left my pocket before she had already snatched it. “Good dog, go on, get.” I patted her on the rear as I opened the bathroom door. \n\n\n\nA lance of high frequency hit and exploded my eardrum. Blood poured out of my ear and vomit spilled onto the ground. “Starting a little soon.” I grunted. I was quick to clean up and was able to hear again after a few seconds. It was coming that night. I just knew it. I knew that no matter what I did, I was gonna get taken. All I could do was prepare. I carved open my stomach and put blades under my organs, tools of many varieties stuffed into layers of fat on my sides, and hid a P320 zip tied to my rib cage. Immortality is a curse to most people, personally despite how much I love my father I made him a promise that’d be the one to kill him and he promised the same but jokes on him, and if I’m not afraid to lose him then I doubt I would be for anyone.\n\n\n\nAfter bleaching the blood and letting my organ settle around the blades, I got ready for bed. After showering and perfuming I found myself unable to go up the stairs to bed. I was stunned at my rigidity. Metal stirred in my guts but even the knowledge I was prepared wasn't enough. “Tony girl. Help me.” She looked at me for a moment, then gently stepped up to the stairs. I placed my hand on her back and kept it there as I slowly followed her up to my bedroom. I let go of her back as I pulled the covers over myself. At the tree line, the deer watched me. The sight of that let me take my first breath in minutes. I still had no clue what it was, but I knew it helped me. It helped Tony. So I trusted it.\n\n\n\nThe cloud of sleep enveloped me and soon I was gone, beyond the veil of dream.\n\n\n\nI wasn’t even surprised when I woke up to belligerent white lights flooding my vision. Fluorescent may not be the word, but it’s the closet description I can provide. Figures stood, cutting out bulb-like shapes in the cascading light. My wrists twitched and caught against the metal clamps holding my limbs down. My fingers dug into and tore open my palms as a slender finger outstretched and probed my face. The prodding was thorough, testing the tender and fattiness of each location. The finger slid to my lips, pressing and pinching them. I went to bite the finger, but realized whatever laundry list of things they did to me before my waking must have included injecting me with a cocktail of paralyzing agents.\n\n\n\nAfter finishing probing my face, they moved to my arms and torso, then my legs and delicates. “Not much meat.” A humming and loose voice spoke. *“Very above average, actually.”* I thought as they commented on my calves. \n\n\n\nThey returned to my stomach. “Fatty, start here.” One spoke to another. “*Dick, I’m on a bulk- start here? Fuck…”* A thin wire dragged along my belly, peeling off a thin sheet of skin. A scream bubbled in my throat but couldn’t burst into existence. My breathing turned into hyper-ventilation and my heart slammed against my rib cage. The light obscured their expressions, but it was obvious one took note. It leaned down and pressed its hearing organ against my chest. “Scared.” It reported to another. \n\n\n\n“Calm it, the fear will ruin the meat.” Its constituent responded.\n\n\n\n“Human. Breath. Take peace in knowing your meaningless existence was given purpose by the lottery of our random selection.” If I could have spit I would have hawked one into the thing’s eye. Sure, life was a bit purposeless after getting my retirement from being the government’s personal harvester, but my land had enough spice, I didn’t need the universe dropping this on me as a treatment for the occasional boredom or thousand yard stare.\n\n\n\n“Astounding.” One of them muttered and I jeered silently. Of all the meat bags they could have grabbed, they grabbed the immortal one. I watched as they split the sheet of skin between the two or three of them. Each took a sommelier-sniff and set the sacred flesh on their equivalent of tongues. “Delicate yet gritty. It has such a tender-aged bite to it, I’m getting notes of war and killer instinct. It’s divine. What a deep oaky flavor, wisps of coffee, gunpowder, and… Tangerine. Delectable.” \n\n\n\n*“Oh fuck me.”* I groaned to myself.\n\n\n\nIn the void of space, under the beat of clinical luminescence, it’s nearly impossible to judge time. Thankfully you don’t spend 3 weeks in Chinese caves systems without learning to track your precise internal clock. 3 hours of their relentless sampling and babbling had passed before they finally stopped. Despite this, the time felt like decades. I’ve endured tortures beyond endless imagination, but none have gotten as close to breaking me as having to lay and listen to those fuckers talk about the “notes” and “nuances” of the taste of my skin. I taste like pork. I know I taste like pork. I happen to know that I pair greatly with some garlic and basil. Don’t compare me to oak and gunpowder or what-the-hell-ever, it’s downright offensive. \n\n\n\nAfter their agonizing circle-jerk of uppity sampling, they clicked off the lights and left the room. With the lights finally off, I could take deeper account of the room. The ceiling was a smooth and hospital-bland white with light projecting circles dotted on the vertices of a pentagon shaped window with a faint chip in the crystal glass.\n\n\n\nMulticolored, blot peppered space filled the infinite view. I can’t imagine how I was surprised by this. I was out, alone in the void. \n\n\n\nMy blood was laced with a bounty of otherworldly drugs and chemicals. My veins wriggled like they were full of maggots. My heart was steady and my breathing was measured. I needed to move. If I could get back my ability to move at least I could dislocated my fingers and deglove my hands to get out. I started breathing heavier, forcing my heart to speed up. I exerted and forced each in and exhale. I felt moisture gather under the clamps as I started sweating. The sweat was green and thick as it was forced out of the pores. It started with a twitch in my finger tips, as movement reached the first knuckle I flexed my finger rapidly. Then it reached my wrist and I flexed and flapped each hand. I didn’t know how long I had but I needed to sweat out as much of these drugs as I could. \n\n\n\nThe moment I had enough movement, I pulled my hands through the clamps. The flesh of my hands peeled off and loose strings of muscle tissue flopped about before healing back into place under fresh skin. I was able to operate my toes by the time I gripped my- above average sized- calves and ripped my feet out. The left foot came completely off but returned promptly. \n\n\n\nTaking in the room I made two assessments. One: Whether by stupidity or ego, they had no cameras in the room. Two: I wasn't alone. \n\n\n\n4 halls, in line with sides of the pentagonal window on the ceiling, sprawled in multi-mile long galleries of still and weakly whimpering aliens. There must have been hundreds of thousands of complex lives strung up and routinely harvested. Liquid and gelatinous lifeforms swirled in sealed tubes with taps at their base. The bodies were marred with thin scars where they removed flesh and organs for feast. The flesh itself was fragile and sloppily healed, like the meat was stapled back on over and over. If the things that took me were advanced enough to traverse the stars looking for “nuanced flavors.” they were probably good at keeping their stock full. \n\n\n\nBlood flooded the metallic floor and my organs cascaded in hot pursuit. “Come on, give it up.” I wheezed and grunted as I rummaged around the blades and tools throughout my organs and tissues. “Why the fuck did I use heavy duty zip ties?” I coughed. The zip tie around my rib finally snapped and the P320 fell onto my liver on the ground. When you’re stuffing your body with weapons to use against aliens who are going to kidnap and eat you, it feels like a lot, but once you take it all out you regret how little shit you actually brought. The blades I had brought were two box cutters, the tools were a wire saw and a garden spade, and sure I had the P320 but I forgot a second magazine. \n\n\n\nKids, if you end up immortal and have premonitions of being kidnapped by aliens: Make sure you back a window breaker of some kind and extra ammo for whatever gun you bring. I recommend putting the extra mags under your intestines. \n\n\n\nI started stuffing my organs back into place when a spark plug was spat out from under a kidney. “When the hell did that slip in?” My ribs clicked back into place and the blood caking me soaked into my body. Lacking a belt, I cut pockets into my thigh and holstered the box cutters and the spark plug. \n\n\n\nThe door which I heard them leave through was perplexing, as I’m sure more alien tech is. The door required a strange appendage to be scanned for the door to open. The print was like a human hand but longer and bony thin. “If I had to bet…” I trailed off into thought, turning my sights to the gallery halls. How long does a species take to dedicate themselves to the complexities of cuisine till they sample their own? Not long I suppose. \n\n\n\n4 bodies deep into the north east hall was a creature matching the appearance and appendage of the others that had sampled me. I took the garden spade and lopped off its hand. With a wet slap and chime the scanner turned some shade of red and the door opened. “Well… Damn.” A command deck with hundreds of bipedal, wet, grey, thin, and tall Graymen was still in shock. “Truce?” A horrid screech filled the room and from the thin, membranous flesh around the tips of their fingers peeled back and razor sharp bone nails were exposed. More concerning than  their transformation, was what was coming into view through the command deck window.\n\n\n\nA luminary pillar of raging opulent gluttony crested into sight. The yellow spatters of aurum light spewed and stained space. A vomit of comic resplendence, the collective piece meal of a million million minds and many more hands. A plant dwarfing bastion of a prestigious and loquacious species. No diamond or pearl equaled one\/ one trillionth of the billowing glow. A space station the size of Jupiter, the mother ship.\n\n\n\nNails sank through my skull and split my head in two. Blood flowed down my shoulders and then lavender blood splashed over my hand as I drove the spade into the Grayman’s throat. “I do not, have ever, nor will ever have notes of tangerine!” Another stepped up to bat and took a box cutter to the stomach. Its noodle guts spilled out and I grappled the wrists of a falling claw. I rolled between its legs, leapt onto its shoulders, tied the guts around its throat, pulled, and sent its hand through its face. “3 years of improv classes, Grace me now.” I ran my tongue against my teeth while getting hacked apart and returning the brutality. *“Escape pod, no they’ll just come for me once I get home. Steal the ship, nope they’ll track it and find me… Ram it? Don’t know about comedy, but solutions certainly do come in 3s.”*\n\n\n\nThey say insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting a new result, but I’ll be damned if smashing your head against a brick wall till the wall caves doesn’t pair wonderfully with immortality. The spade got eaten, the box cutters melted from the Graymen’s box-cutter-dissolving blood, and the P320 was empty at just the perfectly wrong moment. The back of my skull blew open as I was slammed to the ground and dog-piled. “None of you would be interested in a recess would you?” My face got crushed. *“No gun, no weapons, jack-squat…Well, every closed door opens a window… Window!”* Yeah, I had a 80’s crime thriller epiphany, I’m not ashamed to admit it, try it some time.\n\n\n\nThe great thing about accidentally getting a spark plug inside your guts: it gives you a great window breaker that can be used even while getting mauled by aliens.\n\n\n\nI fished the spark plug out from my pocket carved into my thigh. I fumbled it between my teeth and cracked off the ceramic body. I dug out one of the chunks from my gums and waited for an opening. The sea parted and in exodus an ordained ceramic chunk flew towards paradise. The Ozymandias hand of panic eyed Grayman leapt for the escaping fragment. The same time I ran out of biblical metaphor, the window chipped then shuddered away screaming into the mother void. \n\n\n\nMy blood vessels and eyes exploded, regenerating in time for me to catch a death grip of the throttle handle. The gray flew into space, exploding as their blood boiled was dragged out of them. The run of air struggled against my regeneration to rip my arm out of socket. The pressure drained from the ship until silence filled it in its entirety. \n\n\n\nThe ship jittered as the thrusters belched. I crawled through zero-gravity towards a star map in the center of the command room. “*Earth, Earth, Earth, come on, no whammies.”* Intuition guided my finger, spelling out what I hoped would be home. A line of dotted hope stretched through the image of the galaxy connecting me to home. I committed the direction to memory then climbed. I dragged myself out of the window, carefully stalking along the outside to the point I planned to leap from. \n\n\n\nThe mother ship's lights ran crimson, a flashing red that was meant to alert its population to their coming demise. They say it only took 6 miles of rock to eradicate all life on earth however many millions of years ago. As I pushed off the stampeding ship, I wondered how the mothership would fare against a crescent shaped hunk of metal, 11 miles wide, many times denser than granite, charging at a light-chasing speed.\n\n\n\nI prayed a quick prayer for the souls chained up in the ship. The mother ship flashed then liquified into asteroids of super heated metal. An explosion so visceral it split atoms and compounded its own destruction. Flames that licked the tail of heaven and stepped on the head of hell vaporized two neighboring planets, spilling out dust and magma into the great cradle of all things. The mothership’s artificial atmosphere facilitated a shock wave that, while helpful when it came to my speed, turned me into a fine mist. \n\n\n\nThe journey was long. I grazed the pull of black holes and witnessed unmarked nebulas roil, pregnant with baby stars. I froze and boiled, occasionally at the same time. I was lucky to dodge spiraling asteroid belts, but wasn’t lucky enough to avoid plunging though a bright blue star. I’d mark it down as a positive though. My body went from vaporizing while working with Sisyphean will to reform, to mending before I got so much as a sunburn. By the measure of my trusty internal clock, I rocketed through space for about  3 days. Of all the sights I perused along my gallery walk of the galaxy, the most divine was a star being inhaled by a blackhole. The menagerie of colors and the rivers of fission was something no hand or computer could respect with the finest paint brush, most flowery of language, or complex of generation systems. \n\n\n\nWhile that may be the most beautiful moment of the trip, the best was getting pasted as I touched down on my beloved mother Earth. \n\n\n\nTwo hitchhikes, one bus, and a short walk later, I was home. As fast as you read that sentence, the time passed. All of that cosmic travel for a 5 hour trip till I was able to pet a very anxious and excited Tony. I think the term is: Hollow Victory. I was happier than anyone to be home, but now that I was, I was disappointed. For so long my purpose was killing people who threatened the safety of the people for the French Foreign Legion and Delta Force, then it was being the government hole-patcher, then it was Tony. But Tony had joined the routine. I loved her, but learning to take care of her wasn’t a challenge anymore- beside the weekly bath. The supernatural threats, though terrible and draining, were giving variety to my life which lacked such. As I petted Tony’s head, I came to realize that if these nightmares ever did stop: I’d be more lost than ever.\n\n\n\nNah, I’m fucking with you. You should see the look on your face, I sure wish I could. I spent decades as a killer and now I got to enjoy my fucking land and I wanted to enjoy it dammit. “Aw, oh, wee, I hate having a steady routine that is peaceful and beautiful land.” Yeah right. What I hated was having to wait weeks for the next nightmare to come to life. I wanted these damn things dead ASAP so I could sit on my porch and sip coffee while petting Tony for the rest of my life. \n\n\n\n“What do you think… Anything I could do to speed things up a bit?” I asked the deer who was now, after 4 days of me being back on Earth, comfortable joining me and Tony on the porch for coffee. I rubbed its nose against its hoof. “Blood sacrifice maybe? Know a good goat or lamb dealer?” It licked the wood planks of the porch. “My uncle Jacob might know a guy… I need you to hurry!” I yelled to the woods.\n\n\n\n“That won’t help none.” The deer looked me in my widening eyes.\n\n\n\n“Huh?”\n\n\n\nAnd that’s all for part 4 folks. Bit sudden, I know but a threat unlike that I’ve ever seen– Tony swan in mud– has just made its presence known and it requires my full and immediate attention. \n\n\n\nBesides, who doesn’t love cliffhanger? Until next time folks.

The area is nice. Neighbors are friendly. But the odd thing is this squirrel in my neighborhood keeps stalking me. \n\nHow do I know? Because it trails me every time I go out for a walk. It hops along our neighbors’ fences. Whenever I stop to look at it, it freezes like it’s been caught committing a crime. \n\nI’ve dubbed this squirrel, Stranger, because he doesn’t look like other squirrels. You see, most squirrels in the area are brown with bushy tails. But this one has grey hair and a ratty tail, like it was caught in an electrical outlet. Also, part of his left ear is missing.  \n\nEither way, he’s creepy and I’m tired of my roommates pretending like he’s not. Like, just the other day, Stranger was perched in a tree outside our apartment. I threw a rock to scare him off and he scampered away, dropping something in the grass.\n\nWhen I got close to see what it was, I almost passed out: “The fuck?!”\n\nStranger had been chewing on —\n\n— a human finger! \n\n“Gross!”\n\nI called the police. They informed me there’d been a woman downtown who was attacked by a homeless man. She had survived, but two of her fingers had been cut off! Disgusting.\n\nThe cops came, bagged the finger. Told me to call in if I had any more questions. \n\nI did call the next day. Turns out the body part belonged to the woman who’d been attacked. So creepy! \n\n“I mean, seriously, what the hell?!” Why did Stranger have that woman’s finger? Don’t squirrels just eat nuts and stuff? Gross.\n\nThat night, I couldn’t sleep. Roommates were working late, so I was all alone. Around 2 AM, I heard scratching at the door. \n\nI panicked and grabbed my baseball bat. Rushed to the window. Right there in the driveway was… \n\n… Stranger… \n\n“What the —?!”\n\nHe just stared at me with those thin, dark eyes. I was so sick of him following me! I dashed out. Screaming: “You want to drop fingers around me, Dude?! Come on!”\n\nBut when I got to the driveway…\n\n… He was gone…\n\nI went back inside. Delirious. Coated in sweat. Turned on a movie to stay awake. But I must’ve drifted off to sleep because I awoke to the sound of metal scraping at my front door. Someone was trying to get in!\n\nHeart pounding, I dashed into the living room. But stopped dead in my tracks because… near the front door was… a homeless man, crouched over something… his back turned toward me. \n\nHe was wearing a black trench coat and had long grey hair. His odor was faint but disgusting, like rotten meat. And his left ear, like Stranger’s, was partially missing. Wait… what?!\n\n“Oh my god.” I whispered and stood still, not wanting to give away my position. (Somehow he hadn’t seen or heard me yet.) \n\nI took a small step back, landed on a creaking floorboard. The homeless man turned. His eyes were black like Stranger’s. His smile was full of yellow teeth…\n\n“Please… don’t hurt me…” I said, sobbing. The homeless man just laughed. Set something on the ground and went outside. \n\nSoon as he was gone, I barricaded the door. Called the police. I was so scared I could barely breathe. My eyes crept down to the spot where he’d been crouching… and there it was…  \n\n… another human finger!\n\nOver the next few weeks, my roommates and I crashed at another place. Cops searched the area. Found no signs of him. It was like he’d disappeared. Local news started calling our mystery man: “The Finger Thief.” \n\nAnother week passed and there were still no sightings. It was like he had disappeared. Thank god. Maybe another homeless person had dealt with him.  \n\nDays went on and I started to think: “Maybe he’s gone for good. I can get back to normal life.”\n\nHow wrong I was.\n\nThis morning, when I went outside for a walk, I saw something perched high up in a tree. It was Stranger, watching me. I’m not even sure how he found me. But he just titled his head slightly and raised a paw, like he was waving."},"63":{"title":"Death Road","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k98daa\/death_road\/","flair":null,"author":"SquirtCumcision","selftext":"Please forgive me, as It has been almost ten years since this event took place so I am a little fuzzy on a few of the details, but I will tell it to the best of my ability. \n\nIt was mid March, my friends and I were in our early twenties, and were really into backpacking, hiking, camping, etc. Living in the pacific northwest, we were definitely in the right area to satiate our cravings for the outdoors. \n\nWe wanted to go on a weekend camping trip, so earlier in the week we went out scouting for an area to camp. After we drove a ways out of town, we found a rural road that looked really promising. \n\nA few miles down the road, we came to an intersection. We could continue straight, where the paved road turned gravel, turn left to be near a creek about twenty feet from the road, or turn right to what looked like a little-used, mostly grass-covered road. We decided to turn right and see what that area held. The grassy road followed a gentle left curve for about a hundred yards, then opened up to a small roundabout with a flat campground looking area to the right of it. The site looked like it had been used plenty of times, but there was a lot of untouched grass on the road and flat area, so we assumed no one had been there in a while. \n\nWe liked the spot, but it was a little close to the road for us, so we decided to get out and have a look around. Shortly into our inspection, we found a trail that went deeper into the woods. We hiked up it for a quarter mile or so, and really liked the way it looked. It was rural enough that we could really \"feel\" like we were in the outdoors, and there was no pesky cell reception to distract us from mother nature. After deciding this would be our spot for the upcoming weekend, we packed up and headed home. \n\nOnce we got back to cell service, one of us used Google maps to make sure our prospective campsite wasn't on anyone's property. To our relief, we were in the clear for several miles around the area. \n\nWe decided that since we were all able to get friday off work, we would pack up Thursday after getting home, and head out that night, so as to squeeze the most out of our trip. \n\nFast forward to Thursday night. All of our gear is packed, and we have all the food, water, and illicit substances we could need for three days of unwinding in the woods. \n\nAs we pulled up the familiar grassy road and we get around the bend, we see the reflection of our headlights glaring back at us from the darkness like the eyes of a large demon, angry we intruded on its slumber.  It was the tail lights of a parked car. Our hearts collectively drop as we slow to a stop and decide what to do. We can hear a dog barking, and see a tent set up near the car, so we decide to turn tail and head home in defeat. \n\nAfter regrouping at home, we decide that if we try again the following night, it would be enough time that hopefully whoever was there would have packed up and left. \n\nFast forward to Friday night. We pull up and the car is still there, along with the tent and the barking dog. Big let down for sure, but after a brief talk amongst ourselves, we decide to risk it and stay. We park on the roundabout, about fifty feet away from the car and tent, and hike up the trail so that we can be away from whoever was already there. \n\nWe get out and the dog's barking reaches a feral crescendo. Based on the fact that it hasn't already come over and started mauling us, we assume it's leashed up or something. We quickly put on our packs and hike up the trail in the dark with our flashlights on. \n\nIt's a creepy walk, especially since everyone is practically holding our breaths in fear of someone coming out to yell at us for trespassing or ruining their night or something, but nothing happens. \n\nAfter making it to a good spot and setting up camp, we get right to partying. We joke about what the camper, or campers we passed must be thinking or doing right about now, and try to scare eachother with half-cocked theories about whoever it is and what they might do to take revenge on us for barging in on their quiet evening. Little did we know, the memory of our trip would be ruined in a way that none of us could have guessed. Eventually we all fall asleep, and the next day rolls around. \n\nWe spent that Saturday hiking further up the trail and exploring. Nothing major happens, and we end the night much in the same way we did the previous one. Sunday is when the story takes a turn. Everyone is tired, hungover, and pretty much ready to go back civilization, so we start hiking back to the car. \n\nWhen we get there, we all notice a complete shift in the atmosphere. I can only describe the scene as eerie. It felt like all the life had been sucked out of the wilderness. For the first time since arriving, the woods were completely silent. The car was still there, and so was the tent, but we don't hear the dog barking anymore. Being daylight now, we can see more of the encampment. It was unusual, to say the least. \n\nThe car was up on the type of little ramps people use for working on their vehicles. The tent was opened, and there was a plastic fold-up picnic table set up next to the car with all kinds of things on it. Motor oil, transmission fluid, automotive tools, a gallon of milk with the lid off, paper plates, miscellaneous food items, etc. It looked like someone was working on their car in the middle of the woods, and stopped to prepare a meal, only to seemingly vanish into thin air. \n\nCuriosity overtook better judgement, and we decided to have a look around. Walking cautiously through the campsite, we looked for any clues about why the person, or people, could have left in such a hurry. My mind immediately went to the missing 411 cases.\n\nOne of my friends pointed out that the windows of the vehicle were heavily fogged up, so we tried our best to peer inside. The windows were also pretty heavily tinted so looking through them proved difficult, but the fog hadn't quite reached the edges of the glass. This made it possible to just barely see the silhouette of a large dog in the back seat. It sat there upright and panting hard, but not moving or making any other noise. My heart sank. It was Sunday morning, and for all I knew, that dog had been trapped in this car since Thursday night when we first arrived. I assumed that was why it wasn't barking anymore, as it probably didn't even have the energy to do so and was likely badly dehydrated. We debated what to do, and decided trying to break a window or open a door to let the dog out was a bad idea, since it could be violent, or hurt itself on the broken glass. \n\nSince we didn't have cell reception, we decided with heavy hearts that the best choice would be to drive back to town and call animal control as soon as we had service. We left, and I made the call and did my best to explain the situation to the person who answered. He told me he would head out to the area in a few hours and update me on how it went. I thanked him, and that was the end of the call. \n\nI waited around for hours to hear back from the guy, and I started getting restless. Worried for the well being of the dog, I ended up calling him back when it reached around  7PM. He said he tried to follow my instructions, but to my dismay, he mistakenly continued straight down the gravel road for several miles rather than turning right onto the grassy road. He had actually just gotten back to cellphone service when I called. \n\nHe told me he would head back out there the next day and try again, as it was getting late and he had other calls he had to get to. I was distraught. I started debating heading out there myself to let the dog out of the vehicle, but ultimately decided it would be best to let the professionals handle it. I had no idea how good that decision was at the time... \n\nThe next day, I heard nothing back from the animal control guy, despite several calls from me. By about 7PM I was really frustrated, and desperately hoping for the best, but ultimately, fearing the worst. That's when one of my friends, who'd been silently browsing her phone for a while, suddenly gasped. \n\nWhen we asked what was wrong, she started reading aloud from her phone. It was a news story from a city about four hours away from ours. To this day, I have no idea how or why they were able to report on this news so quickly. The story roughly went as follows: \n\n\"On *redacted* road (the same one we went down to camp)  in the town of *redacted* Animal Control was called about a dog trapped in a vehicle for several days. When they arrived on scene, they tried the door of the vehicle, which was locked. The animal control employee called the local deputies, and a state patrol officer who was in the area showed up to assist. Upon shining his flashlight through the tinted window of the vehicle, the state patrol officer was able to identify the body of a woman in the back seat, accompanied by the dog in question. When the local deputies arrived, they were able to open the vehicle and help animal control capture the dog, a pit bull, who was very aggressive upon the door being opened. The woman, identified as *redacted* was deceased. Cause of death is at this time unknown. \" \n\nWe all sat in silence for about, I kid you not, maybe ten seconds, and then my phone rang, showing a private number. I answered, and a female voice said \"Hello, this is detective *redacted*, is this Mr. *redacted*?\" To which I answered by saying \"Yes, may I ask what this is about?\" Or something along those lines. She asked if I was the person who called in the dog trapped in the car, and I told her that I was. She asked me to explain to her what happened, and I told her everything from the Thursday night we went out there, up until our present phone call -minus the bit about us just having read the news story. Something in my gut told me it would be better not to mention what we had just learned. She seemed surprised, and said \"oh, that's it?\" To which I replied that yes, that was all. And as an afterthought, I asked how the dog was doing. She said it was alive and in the hands of animal control. I then asked if she needed anything else from me, and she said no, but that I would hear from her if anything else came up. \n\nThe call ended, and we all started talking at once, asking each other if anyone had touched the vehicle, or anything at the campsite. To our relief, it appeared none of us had. We couldn't help but imagine what would have happened had we broken a window to rescue that poor dog though. \n\nThe next day I called the animal control guy and re-introduced myself, and apologized for his experience after explaining that we saw a news story about what he had found. I asked him what would become of the dog, and he told me it was going to the humane society and that they were going to try to rehabilitate it. Apparently, it had been trapped in the vehicle so long that it started eating the person who was in there with it.  I asked if I could come visit the dog, and he said that right now the dog was technically \"evidence\" related to the case and that I couldn't see it, but he would let me know if anything changed. \n\nAfter a few weeks of waiting and wondering, I called the humane society to ask about the dog, and was told they regrettably had to put it down. I guess there was just no coming back from what that poor thing went through. I didn't get, or ask for any more details. \n\nEventually we got word about the coroner's report. The woman was transient, and a mother with an ex-husband and a nine year old son. She died from a drug overdose. Time of death was recorded to have happened at approximately midnight of the very same Thursday that we first went to the camp site and saw her car. \n\nAfter all this time, I googled that old news story about what had happened just to refresh my memory on the details. What I found really took me by surprise. According to several other news stories that came up in my search results, stretching back to at least as early as 16 years before our event took place, and up until the current year of 2025, there have been a surprising number of mysterious deaths that occur on that specific road we found... \n\nWe haven't been back to that neck of the woods since, and probably never will. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"64":{"title":"I worked as an overnight watchman at abandoned properties across New England.

Not for the past two weeks. I grappled with the idea of telling Emma throughout my sleepless nights, being tormented by my past while she slept soundly beside me. She knew something was wrong but I’ve been able to keep myself together. The insomnia has made work a disaster however and my boss sent me home early yesterday. He wasn’t angry but just seemed… worried about me. I’ve been so engrossed in my own world of panic and fear that has only grown lonelier and lonelier. Emma has really been the only one to break me out, even if just temporarily during our date night or while watching TV laid out on the couch. \n\nAs I drove home last night, I tried to take my mind off of the knock by turning up the music in the car. I hoped the sound could drown out my own negative thoughts with something more positive and lively. As the first song ended however and the station went to a commercial break, my thoughts grew much darker much too quickly. \n\nThe first commercial was for a local fast food restaurant, nothing I hadn't heard a thousand times before. The second however, noticeably dated and with crunchy, weaker audio, I had only heard once before and the sound of the opening jingle nearly sent me off the road.\n\nSouthside Square Mall, just on the outer edge of Harmon by the lonely north-south highway, closed in the summer of 2016. There were talks of what to do with the land but ultimately, it just sat empty for a lot longer than I think anybody hoped. The owners of the property did not want anyone getting inside. The first time they contracted my father’s company, it was for alarms and cameras. Kids were smarter than they thought however, and soon they were finding more creative ways inside than the floor to ceiling glass windows or boarded up main entrances. So eventually, my father was called upon again for a night watchman.\n\nSouthside Square wasn’t the location I was assigned to watch right after the boot came off but the memories of the abandoned bank or truck stop that were sandwiched between dissolved to barely a trace of a recollection. In my mind, the mall might as well have come right after the factory. \n\nIt was the first large assignment my father felt comfortable with me undertaking by myself. After what happened at the factory, he’d been treating me differently. He always looked at me with worry and fear in his eyes no matter the conversation. He gave me smaller and closer locations and admittedly I was happy to return to the mundane nights of nothingness I’d grown to expect from the job. Time at each location was short lived however as watchmen tended to rotate jobs every month or so, especially at smaller locations like the ones my father had been giving me. Finally my time had come to draw the shortest straw. At least I thought it was at the time.\n\nI remember pulling up to the chain link fence that surrounded the property, the headlights of the car barely able to make out the shape of the building. It seemed so far from where I stood, a sea of parking separating myself from the structure. Grass and weeds grew up from the cracks in the concrete, tire marks scarring the asphalt from kids doing burnouts and doughnuts. The exterior of the building looked tired, its entryway windows foggy and doors blocked off. The concrete walls were stained with grime and signs were faded or outright missing. Where they once hung were ghostly outlines of what once was.\n\nThe security trailer was on the far side of the mall, near the entrance which used to house the food court. The trailer was fitted the same as I’d come to expect and I spent the first night settling into the office and getting a lay of the land. The mall did not have power anymore but luckily the last owners never upgraded their directories to digital so the maps were very helpful in navigating the building. It had been a couple years since I’d been inside and in the dark, any landmarks that I remembered from when I was younger were shrouded in the shadows. Unlike my previous locations, part of the parameters of my job included walking the interior of the mall. I guess because the owners actually believed the building was worth saving in some form. \n\nOver the course of my first week I slowly got more familiar with the layout of the mall’s interior. I started to memorize where stores were, and sometimes remember what was there when I was younger. Towards the end a lot of businesses left the mall and were seemingly replaced by no-name cheaper alternatives. It was sort of a fun nostalgia trip for me, roaming the halls of a place that I’d once spent so much of my time and had a lot of good memories. I even found the bench where I’d had my first kiss. \n\nBy the second week, I’d caught my first trespassers. I remember hearing rumblings of the abandoned mall when I was in high school so I imagined I’d come across kids at some point or another. It was a group of kids, probably a couple years younger than I was. I spotted them on the camera coming in through one of the old loading docks while aimlessly wasting my time in the trailer. I sighed, knowing I’d probably not get the best response from the boys. The first time I’d caught trespassers, it was at the truck stop. High school kids as well, probably from the neighboring district to Harmon. They laughed at me when I told them to leave and it took an actual call to the police to get them to listen. I guess I wasn’t the most intimidating presence. I still could’ve easily passed as one of their classmates.\n\nI groaned as I pulled myself out of the office chair, preparing mentally for a difficult encounter and probably some name calling I’d rather not elaborate on. I grabbed my flashlight, pepper spray and baton, sliding them onto my belt and stepping out into the cool evening breeze. The overgrown trees in the islands of the parking lot swayed gently amongst the forest on the horizon but stranded in the ocean of concrete. The building loomed over me, its black silhouette contrasting with the bright, vibrant stars of the night sky. One of the few things that I truly loved about growing up in the middle of nowhere.\n\nI trekked towards the food court entrance, light rain starting to pitter on and off as I unlocked the large security door over the glass airlock. When the door shut behind me, any sound of the outside world was squashed. The mall was dead silent. The stale air inside the building felt heavy, strangely worse than I’d grown accustomed to. I took out my flashlight and clicked it on. I walked past the empty fast food counters, only the dated tiling on the walls indicating what restaurants that would’ve once been. I grazed over each of the counters with my flashlight but it was so quiet inside the building, I could’ve heard those kids breathing. I knew wherever they were, it was a fair distance away from me. \n\nThe main thoroughfares of the mall had seen better days. Any plants inside had either died or overgrown their pots and spread onto the increasingly cracked tile floor. Signs had fallen off or were stolen from their mountings. The occasional storefront window was smashed in. Furniture was strewn about haphazardly. Water stains dotted the white ceilings. The mall wasn’t absolutely trashed but it would’ve taken serious money to get it into any presentable state again. \n\nIt took a good ten minutes before I finally started to hear voices, laughter at the far end of the wing I’d found myself traveling down. One of the large anchor stores sat with its entranceway wide open like a gaping mouth, revealing a truly black abyss inside where no light extended further than ten feet. The kids, two boys and a girl, didn’t notice me at the other end of the hallway as I spotted them. They were too busy peaking their heads into the abyss of the department store. The sign above their heads still displayed the store name, however the company had long since given up on Southside Square. \n\nI approached them as quietly as I could muster, not wanting them to run off and lead me on a wild goose chase. As much as I’d tried to study the mall’s layout, I was not confident in my hide and seek skills. I watched the kids whispering to each other, checking their phones and shining their flashlights into the empty stores around them. Before I knew it, it was time to make myself known.\n\n“Hey, you guys can’t be in here. This is private property.” I said calmly as I approached them. I’d learned my first go around that the tough guy approached was not something I could pull off. The three of them quickly spun around and froze at the sight of me.\n\n“W-who are you?” The taller of the two boys asked, his voice slightly nasally.\n\n“I’m the night watchman. Now please, I can’t let you guys stay here, this is trespassing.” I explained, trying to keep a professional manner. The other boy’s eyes lit up.\n\n“W-wait so you’re here like every night?” He questioned. He turned to the young girl, who I could only imagine was forcefully dragged into the situation. Unlike the boys, she seemed genuinely afraid of me. “Julia, he’s got to know where it is. Ask him.” He whispered to her.\n\n“Ryan, are you an idiot? H-he’s here to fucking arrest us.” She replied angrily, still with fear in her eyes. I couldn’t help but break a smile.\n\n“Guys I’m not going to arrest you, alright. I’m not a cop. But if you don’t leave, I will be forced to call them. And if I see you on the property again, same deal.” I tried to reassure them.\n\n“W-wait but we need to find something. We weren’t going to break stuff or anything I swear.” The taller boy tried bartering.\n\n“Y-yeah, my girlfriend told me about this place her friends went to and I had to see if I could find it myself.” The other boy who I could assume was Ryan, elaborated. I bit my lip for a second, genuinely a little curious about what place exactly they were talking about. I knew a few spots in the mall were pretty cool and unusual but in my own mind, none of them risked being caught trespassing. Then again, I was the one doing the catching.\n\n“What exactly are you talking about?” I hesitantly asked, a little ashamed of myself for giving into my curiosity. Ryan nudged his girlfriend to speak. She gave him an annoyed look and stepped forward.\n\n“We um… m-my friends told me about this store in the mall that they said they never remember being there. One of the big ones with two floors. It was like, really old looking. Like 70s old. And it… they said it messes with you. Like your head. I guess it’s haunted or something? I don’t know, they were probably lying just to freak me out since I didn’t go with them. Then these two found out and uh… I got dragged along anyway.” She explained, letting out a sigh. “I knew this was a bad idea.”\n\nI gave her a puzzled look. I knew every anchor store in the mall, by heart at this point. They were so easily recognizable, locating them took a matter of five minutes even if you’d never step foot inside the building before. And I found it incredibly odd that anybody, even a few stupid kids, couldn’t find them all. \n\n“Did the store have a name?” I regretted asking as I really started to question why I was even continuing this conversation and we weren’t walking to the exit.\n\n“No man, they just said they didn’t remember it being here. And those girls were here like every day after school when we were little. They would’ve remembered.” The taller boy answered quickly.\n\n“It might’ve closed when they were young. And if they were experiencing anything psychological, there could’ve been a gas leak in the building. That’s one of the reasons it's not safe to be here.” I said, trying to reach logical explanations for their claims. In the back of my head however, I was deathly curious. I wanted to find this store myself, but I knew I had to do my job first. I had to escort these kids out of the mall.\n\nIt took a lot of back and forth and a few threats to the police before they finally agreed to leave. I felt like I’d spent hours going around in a circle with these kids but by the time we were back in the desolate parking lot it had barely been twenty minutes. They warned me more of their classmates were likely to try looking for the store to which I replied “Then the police are going to have a busy week ahead of them” as ominous as I could. They simply laughed as they walked back down the empty road and I rolled my eyes as I locked the gate behind me.\n\nWhen I turned back around to face the mall the feeling in the air had changed. This place that I thought I’d learned like the back of my hand now had this aura of mystery and allure that I never had felt before. Even if the kid’s story was full of shit, which I assumed it was, it could be kind of fun to see which anchor they were looking for. But maybe there was more truth to the story than I wanted to believe. As much as I had tried to move on from the factory, moments of it stuck with me and when I closed my eyes, I could still see myself in that moonlit room. I could see the Knocker standing in the doorway, studying me while completely motionless. My optimistic curiosity soured as the thoughts ran through my mind and I returned to reality. I didn’t understand what happened to me that night in the factory but I know what I saw. There was danger in the darkness, especially alone. \n\nFeeling a grim mood rush over me, I decided not to venture back inside that night. For the first time since my first couple of nights back, I was feeling a strong wave of anxiety and nervousness. I couldn’t stay still watching the cameras. I’d constantly pace around the room, popping my head to the window to try to catch some sort of monster looking back at me. But there was never anything there. Just the empty parking lot surrounding me on all sides.\n\nThe next night I was forced back inside the mall. Southside Square’s layout was odd but there was a central corridor that all others led off or connected back to. I’d learned these different wings of the mall by the street names they were given. All named after trees except for Main, it was a relic of the mall’s earliest era but the faux street signs still stood at the intersection of every hallway. They were bolted straight into concrete which made them difficult to steal, unlike many of the newer fixtures that once dotted the common spaces of the mall.\n\nAs I passed “Pine Street”, the wing that led exclusively to a home improvement store, I noticed something peculiar. Across the way, shrouded in a somehow thicker darkness away from the shine of the moon, was a parallel wing. It has similar shops and at the end, an immense entrance to some kind of anchor store. The store’s wood paneled exterior and warm colored display windows seemed bizarrely dated for the mid 2000s fixtures and design of the rest of the mall. Southside Square had gone through several renovations and as far as I was aware, there was essentially no remnant of its 70s and 80s era heyday. But this didn’t make me interested or curious. It startled me. It scared me. It was unknown. There wasn’t supposed to be a parallel wing to Pine Street. It was supposed to be for Chestnut. I slowly turned my head to see further down the main concourse, assuming maybe I was remembering wrong. Or maybe someone had somehow switched the signs. But my fears were confirmed. Chestnut and Main crossed each other just as they always did. \n\nI turned to face the foreign and blindly began walking. The air felt colder as I stepped down the wing, increasingly so as I approached the anchor store. I shined my light up above its gaping entrance way. The name Randall’s was written out in script with a red with white outline. The sign seemed aged, its colors faded and washed out noticeably where light bulbs used to illuminate it. Unlike the other anchor stores, Randall’s didn’t have the theft prevention gates guarding the wide expansive entrance. Only stand up advertisement signs greeted me, listing the sales that had long since passed and new inventory that had long gone out of style. \n\nI stood at the entrance to Randall’s for a long time, studying the store. Trying to conjure up some kind of memory of the place. Anything to confirm to me that what I was looking at had always been there. While I could see into the store, whatever light the mall’s dirty skylights provided was snuffed out less than 20 feet in. It left the dark shadows of shelves, mannequins and displays up to the imagination. My flashlight’s beam barely penetrated into the store’s sales floor, leaving me just as in the dark, so to speak, as before. A draft blew over me from within the cavernous opening of Randall’s, the wind whispering through my ears.  It sent a shiver down my spine as I finally started to back away from the storefront. I wanted to know more, desperately so. But it didn’t feel right. The entrance to the store felt like a venus fly trap waiting for its prey to walk inside. \n\nIt was a ridiculous thought, I knew that. It was just a building, brick, steel and concrete. It couldn’t hurt me, not any more than any other abandoned building that is. I thought about how I was overreacting as I walked back to the security trailer. As I opened the door to step inside, I looked back at the mall and tried to spot where Randall’s would’ve been located. The anchor stores were quite obvious from the outside, more so than any other store. I counted the big brown and beige boxes that stuck out from the sides and ends of the mall, listing which store was where. But I couldn’t find Randall’s. Not for the life of me. I cast my eyes across the building multiple times. It should’ve been clear as day. Another bump in the hills and valleys of the mall’s outline. But it simply wasn’t there.\n\nI didn’t leave the trailer for the rest of the night, trying to take my mind off of Randall’s and the school of questions swimming in my head. The isolation, the silence of the space I found myself in made my thoughts simply echo off the walls of my brain. I watched the clock tick agonizingly slowly as the sun finally started to peak over the horizon line. Grabbing my things, I waited impatiently by the door for my relief. \n\nLeonard pushed open the door fifteen minutes late, something I honestly did expect but desperately hoped wouldn’t have been the case this morning. He was a tall, lanky man in his late twenties. Shaggy brown hair was kept at bay by the cap nestled on his head and his five o’clock shadow was haphazardly shaved. I remember him working at the fast food restaurant downtown when I was little. He was always nice to me from behind the counter, and made sure I got the toy I wanted in the kid’s meal. You never forgot a face in Harmon. Everyone knew everyone and most of us would never leave.\n\nI asked Leonard about Randall's when he walked in the doorway but he wasn't of much help. The man was barely awake as usual and didn't even register my question until I said it for the third time. \"N-no Adam, it's really not ringing a bell. If I think of something. I'll leave a note for you on the desk, alright?\"\n\nOn my drive back home, I yawned as I sought through the radio stations. The early morning didn’t net a lot of good results up in the middle of the scenic nowhere I called home. As I passed between two of the stations I knew did come through, something came through the static on a station I didn’t recognize. At first it was subtle, barely audible above the white noise. I took my hand off the dial, genuinely curious what was coming in over what I could only have imagined was a rare long distance station. It was unrecognizable, just a hint of music along with voices. As I came to a red light however, I turned up the volume and tried to decipher what was coming through. The static slowly faded and the transmission began to clear up. It sounded dated however, something recorded onto an analog machine with that tinny sounding voice you’d hear on old tv shows.\n\n“-for your family this summer. Randall’s is the only place to shop. We can’t wait to see you very soon.” A dated, midwestern accent read. A short jingle followed, telling the listener the best price and best service was only a short drive away. “A store so special you’ll never want to leave” it ended with. The commercial then started over. And I listened to it again, and again, and again. The same jingle, the same scripted voice. The same slogan. After the third time, I knew I wasn’t going crazy and I wasn’t just sleep deprived. Randall’s was real. And it wanted to make sure I believed it.\n\nMy father was sitting in the family room with my mom, watching the morning news while sipping on freshly brewed coffee. I could smell the aroma as I walked through the kitchen door. Both my parents turned to look at me as I stepped through the doorway, warm smiles on their faces. Since Sean had left, I was the only one left for them to give attention to. Sometimes that was a blessing, other times it was a curse. \n\n“Hey kiddo, how was your night last night?” My dad asked, but I didn’t answer him. My mind was elsewhere and I walked past them like a zombie. “Was Leonard late this morning again, I noticed you… came in… late.” His words fell off as I swung myself around the stairs. Out of the corner of my eye I saw my parents’ smiling facing morph to concerned looks. My brain was filled with nothing but fear and questions, and I didn’t know which was fueling which more. I couldn’t even give them an attempt of acknowledgement. I was physically and mentally exhausted.\n\n“Richard, see what’s going on with him. H-he didn’t look right.” I heard my mother insist to my father from the top of the stairs. My dad let out a sigh.\n\n“Yeah… yeah there’s something up. I can tell. I uh… see what I can find out. You know how he gets though.” He replied, groaning as he stood up from the couch and put down his mug on the coffee table. “I hope it’s not… work related. Especially after what happened back in May.”\n\n“If it is, we’re going to have to have a talk about this. I know you say he’s up to this but… he’s our son, Richard.” My mom insisted.\n\n“Oh trust me, Rach. We will.” He agreed. I was already shutting my bedroom door as I heard his footsteps race up the stairs in chase of me. I laid out on my bed, rubbing my temples as I prepared for the interrogation I was about to receive. My father knocked on the door right on queue.\n\n“Hold on Dad, just… I need a second.” I pleaded, my voice exhausted.\n\n“Adam, please open the door.” My father said quietly but with a hint of firmness in his tone. I heaved myself to my feet and swung open the door.\n\n“What?” I asked plainly, my brain already starting to shut down for my morning nap. It was a routine I wasn’t proud of but staying up all night, it was the only way to recharge.\n\n“Did something happen last night at work? Because your mother and I both know when something’s going on with you, kiddo.” He gave me as sincere a smile as he could, even chuckling a little as he finished speaking. But behind his expression I could tell he was concerned. It was the same look as when he first laid eyes on me in the emergency room.\n\n“Dad, have you ever heard of a department store in the mall named Randall’s?” I asked flat out, completely ignoring his question. I think no matter how I intended to respond to him, the same answer would’ve come out whether I liked it or not. He stared straight at me, stiff as a board. His face didn’t move a muscle and for the first time I truly couldn’t get a read on my father’s normally very expressive face. All I could see were his eyes and they did not change. He was scared. I’m just not sure if his fear came from the question I asked or the anticipation that I might’ve asked it. After a moment, he collected himself, loosed up and spoke three words as clear and calm as ever.\n\n“No, I haven’t.” He told me. His eyes burned into mine, desperately awaiting my response. I nodded slowly.\n\n“Well I um… just thought I saw something about it in the mall.” I lied, “An ad on the floor or something. Just… never remembered it being there is all.”\n\n“Your memory serves you right, that store doesn’t exist as far as I can remember.” He told me. “Could ask your mom though, she was usually the one to take you shopping.” \n\n“Right yeah… maybe I will. It’s just I caught these kids last night and they were saying something about a store that wasn’t on the mall maps so I thought since I didn’t remember Randall’s-”\n\n“Adam, I personally have surveyed that property a dozen times. At this point so have you and you tell me, is there an anchor store called Randall’s that you’ve seen?” He wondered, genuinely looking curious to hear my response.\n\nI hesitated. “N-no, I don’t think so.” I finally replied. \n\n“Then what are we getting so worked up about, kiddo?” My father questioned, trying to return to his positive mood. “I mean are you really letting some kid’s creepy story get to you?”\n\n“No, i-it wasn’t even creepy.” I had to admit, telling the truth without at all indulging in the details of my night. “It just was uh… off putting. I-I was on edge the whole night.” My father put his hand on my shoulder, sitting me down on my bed beside him.\n\n“Listen, I know you had a rough start to the job. What happened was… it wasn’t what I wanted. And that was a one in a million chance.” He paused for a moment, trying to word what he wanted to say next. “And I just… It’s important that… I-I want you to feel safe. We don’t get a lot of crazies out here squatting in these places. You know that by now. This job is supposed to be pretty straight forward, you know? Low stress. And seeing you walk in here looking like you saw a ghost, ignoring your mother and me, that doesn’t seem like a low stress night on the job.”\n\n“Y-yeah I’m sorry, Dad. I should’ve at least said hi to you guys. I just… had a lot on my mind. And I really am exhausted.” I apologized, still trying to justify myself as much as I could.\n\n“It’s alright, Adam. Just… don’t let those stories get to you. They’ll drive you crazy, especially when you have the whole night alone to think about them.” He advised me, standing up and stretching his back. “If you want to talk more about anything, you know I’m always here. A-and as your dad, not your boss. Just to clarify.”\n\nI cracked a smirk, couldn’t help it. “Y-yeah, Dad. I get it.”\n\n“Good, good. Listen, I’ve got to make a couple appointment calls this morning but if there’s anything you need me for, I’m pretty open this afternoon.” He offered.\n\n“I’ll see when I wake up.” I told him, yawning a little.\n\n“Of course, of course. I won’t delay that any longer.” He assured me. “Oh and Adam, I know I probably don’t say this as much as I should but… love you, kiddo.”\n\n“Thanks Dad, love you too.”\n\nHe nodded as he slipped out of my room and pulled out his phone from his pocket. I watched him quickly dial a number as he headed for his office at the end of the hall.\n\n“Yes, can I speak to Dr. Ackerman… It's urgent.” There was an insistence in his voice as he grabbed the door behind him and tugged it to shut as he stepped inside. “Hey this is Rich from \\[redacted\\] Securities-” The door closed behind him with a slow clunk. From there, my father’s voice was an unintelligible garble. \n\nWhat little I caught of the call concerned me. He was clearly lying to my face about speaking to clients, I wasn’t an idiot. And who he did call did not seem like his medical doctor. I thought it must’ve been the property owner at the time. But that wasn’t what actually scared me.\n\nMy father asked me if I’d ever seen an anchor store called Randall’s. And while I’ll readily admit I lied straight to his face. Something I felt very guilty doing. He had done the same. I knew the second he’d asked that question because I never told him Randall’s was an anchor store.\n\nThe entire day I didn’t speak to anyone in the house. My mom was out running errands and my father kept his distance from me. He ended up going into the office in the afternoon and it left me completely alone in the quiet of an empty house. I debated with myself for what felt like hours whether I should look for Randall’s that night. If I would even find it where I’d left it the night before. And if I did, should I step foot inside? The painfully curious side of my brain was almost begging my more rational side to let loose and just walk in. But I knew there was something wrong with that place. And in my gut I knew it was stupid to walk in alone. So I called the only person who’d be stupid enough to take the leap of faith with me.\n\n“Hey man, what’s up? You off work tonight or something?” Devon asked as the phone finally connected. His voice seemed monotone, as if my call had woken him up despite it being 3:30 in the afternoon. It wouldn’t have surprised me.\n\n“No I uh… ok this is going to sound stupid.” I opened, my own tone more serious.\n\n“Most of what you say is, Adam.” He joked back. I rolled my eyes.\n\n“Very funny.” I said sarcastically. “But seriously, do you remember a store at Southside Square called Randall’s? Like an anchor store not inside the mall.”\n\n“I… I don’t think so. Wait, aren't you watching that place these days?” he remembered.\n\n“Yeah, the past couple of weeks actually.” I confirmed. “So you’ve never heard of Randall’s at all?” I reiterated.\n\n“N-no dude I really haven’t um… can I ask why exactly you’ve got your panties in a knot over this?”\n\nI gave him the entire rundown of the past two nights, the kids looking for the store, the rumor going around their high school, then my own encounter with Randall’s. I tried my best to describe the area I found myself in but he didn’t really understand.\n\n“Adam, I'm really struggling to understand what you’re telling me. So there’s a part of the mall that all of us just didn’t notice existed for however many decades the place has been open? I looked it up while you were talking and I could not find a single thing online.” Devon tried to wrap his head around the idea, clearly thinking I was either high out of my mind or losing it.\n\n“I-I don’t know, Devon. I don’t think it ever existed. And everyone I’ve asked has said the same. But I know what I saw.” I assured him, being as stern as I ever had been with my best friend. Devon let out a sigh.\n\n“Alright Adam, I believe you think you saw whatever you saw but I-I honestly don’t know what else to say here man. Is… is there something I can do? Do you need help? Anything man, you know I’ll be there.” He offered, sounding both concerned and desperate.\n\n“I want you to come to work with me tonight.” I said plainly. \n\n“A-are you sure that’s-”\n\n“It’s fine, my dad won’t care.” I interrupted. “And if he does… I’ll deal with it, it’ll be fine. I just need… I need someone to tell me what I’m seeing is real. Or maybe that I really am just crazy.”\n\n“Well, you know I won’t pass up a free ride to an abandoned place. And to tell you you’re going crazy. When should I be there?”\n\n“Swing by around 5:30.” \n\n“I’ll be there.” He assured me.\n\nDevon was always exactly on time, it was a bizarre skill that I never seemed to master. And today was no different. He knocked on my door at 5:30 on the dot just as I was throwing my shoes on. We jumped in my car and started heading down towards the south end of Harmon. The mall wasn’t far from my house, but then again nothing was. We sat at the traffic light, the sun’s evening golden rays shining over the tree line and gently accenting the building in the distance. The radio station had gone to commercials but we didn’t bother changing it. We were too busy talking. It felt good to talk, especially to Devon. It kept my mind off the job that I was going back to. \n\n“You know I haven’t been in that place in a couple of years. Honestly it was still pretty clean, I don’t think a lot of people had figured out a way in. How’s it looking these days?” Devon wondered, his gaze drifting to the abandoned mall.\n\n“It’s not the worst I’ve seen. People definitely did their fair share of damage though honestly. Lots of tags, broken windo-” I froze in mid sentence. The radio had gone static in the time I started to speak and it took me just that split second to recognize exactly what had started playing.\n\n“A-Adam? You alright, man?” Devon looked at me concerned.\n\n“D-do you hear this song? T-the commercial?” I stuttered my way out. The Randall’s commercial played as loudly as its poorly recorded audio could muster, echoing through the car’s tired speakers. Devon listened intently, and I watched his expression shift as he started to realize it was exactly, to a tee, what I had described to him over the phone. \n\n“I-it’s the-”\n\n“It’s the same fucking thing, dude. The same thing I heard this morning after leaving work.” I confirmed. “I’m telling you, there is something wrong going on.”\n\n“A-are you fucking with me, Adam? Because I swear to god if-”\n\n“I’m not.” I said sternly.\n\n“W-why does it just keep repeating?” He asked, his voice trembling just slightly. I shook my head as the light finally turned green.\n\n“I-I don’t know. Let’s just… get up there and out of the car. Turn off the radio.”\n\n“Didn’t have to tell me twice.”\n\nThe mall loomed over us as we drove up through the gate. Leonard had already left, as was usual, and I locked up before we made it to the security trailer. The silence in the car as we traveled over the cracked asphalt ocean was agonizing but Devon, the one who I hoped would keep my own brain in check, was thoroughly freaked out. I hadn’t seen him like this since we’d tried to shortcut through the woods while trick-or-treating in fourth grade.\n\nWe stopped in the security trailer momentarily and I gave Devon a quick tour. I looked for a note from Leonard but as I expected, it was nowhere to be found. Devon tried messing around with the cameras, telling me it was just because he thought they were cool. However I could tell in his eyes, he was looking for something in particular. I didn’t let him look for long, I knew he wouldn’t find anything on the cameras. I’d already tried. I handed him a flashlight from the locker and took one for myself. \n\n“Come on man, let’s go. We’re just… wasting time.” I insisted. He stood up from the desk, the chair rolling back to the wall.\n\n“Right… delaying the inevitable. I-I just don’t know exactly what the inevitable is.”\n\n“Neither do I.” I admitted.\n\nThe interior of the mall looked the same as I’d left it. Devon was like a kid in a candy store, throwing up his phone and taking pictures of everything that we passed. I felt like a father having to drag his kid around the mall. And I suppose in a sense I was. Even if Devon was two months older than me. \n\nWhile he was taking pictures, I was watching the street signs. Willow, Maple, Chestnut and finally Pine. I put my arm out to stop Devon as I stared at the eerily dark hallway to Randall’s. He gave me a confused look before his eye caught the faded red sign.\n\n“H-holy shit. But I didn’t see-”\n\n“You wouldn’t have. I didn’t either.” I admitted to him. We both slowly approached the entranceway, the coldness becoming increasingly noticeable as the gaping mouth of the store grew larger and larger in front of us.\n\n“Jesus Christ, Adam.” Devon exclaimed as we stopped right on the threshold of the tile flooring. I could see the goosebumps on his arms. “This is not… this isn’t normal. This feels wrong.”\n\n“I know… but we need to know what it is.” I took the first step forward, looking up at the doorway and expecting giant teeth to chomp down on me. But nothing happened. I walked inside just like any other store in the mall. Devon hesitantly did the same. We walked further inside, not saying a word but conveying a thousand with our just eyes. The store was quiet, deathly so. It felt like a soundproof room, separated from reality through every sense. \n\nOur flashlight beams seemed to shine dimmer as we walked further. The store was becoming colder, so much so that I was shivering with my security jacket on. Our steps became more hesitant and without even realizing it, we were holding onto each other’s sleeves. We were enveloped in the deepest, most isolating darkness I’d ever experienced. I could barely make out Devon next to me, but I felt his hand shakily clenching my shirt. That’s when I started to hear him scream.\n\nHis hand dug into my arm and I first I was both confused and terrified. My best friend began crying hysterically, calling out names. Some I recognized, some I didn’t. He tried to run but I held him back, terrified of losing my only source of tangibility. \n\n“A-Adam, w-why are they talking to me? W-why are they doing this? P-p-please just make it stop!” He pleased with me, nearly falling to his knees. I nearly broke down crying myself. I’d never felt so helpless. I couldn’t even see my best friend, only hear his own suffering as he held onto my arm. \n\n“I-it’s going to be ok, Devon. We’re going to get out of here I-I swear.” I tried looking around for anything. Shelves, a sign, furniture, a landmark. But the darkness had consumed it all. The store was so dark, I was starting to question whether my eyes were even open. I started to feel things brush pass me as I dragged Devon along aimlessly. He stumbled behind me, crying hysterically. My heart was beating out of my chest as my steps forward became more difficult. The things brushing past me became to feel like a crowd of people I was wading through. I could hear their unintelligible whispers in the voices of people I could easily recognize. My mom, dad, grandparents, aunts and uncles. Dead, alive or otherwise, their voices filled my ears as I pushed forward and dragged Devon behind me. My ears were overwhelmed and I could feel the tears starting to streak down my face as I felt whatever stamina I had left giving out on me. My leg finally gave out and I tripped over something in the darkness. I collapsed to the ground and took Devon down with me. I felt his arm momentarily lose its grip before desperately clawing at the fabric of my sleeve to recapture it. \n\nWhen I looked up, all I saw in front of me was the messy, abandoned center corridors of the Southside Square Mall. Devon was still behind me, laying flat out on the tile face down balling his eyes out. I turned my head behind us at the façade of Randall’s. Its security gate was shut, the metallic structure old and rusted, as if it hadn’t moved in 30 years. Behind it you still couldn’t see further than twenty feet inside. But amongst the shadows I could see people shuffling from within. And they were staring at us, looking right into my eyes. I turned my head away, never daring to turn back. I threw up right there on the floor and completely broke down, crying next to my best friend for what felt like hours.\n\nI never walked past Pine Street again. I always lied on my reports, and never dared follow any trespassers. I'd just sit in the trailer and call the police. Devon and I agreed to never speak of what happened again. And I didn’t hear from him for over a month. Luckily we’re still as close as ever, something I was worried wouldn’t be the case after Randall’s.\n\nI never again asked a soul about the department store Randall’s, the anchor store that doesn’t exist. And I never heard a soul speak of it in return. No mention that it ever had or ever would exist. Not until just two hours ago last night. I haven’t told Emma. But I think I need to. She saw it on my face, there was no hiding it. I’m scared, terrified. And at this point, I don’t know what I should do. I think I should call Devon but I don’t know how he’ll respond. I can’t just keep letting these things happen because one of these nights Emma’s going to be waiting for me and I’m not going to come home."},"65":{"title":"Swamp Ghost","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k9dgwn\/swamp_ghost\/","flair":null,"author":"jiltedone","selftext":"“So tell me soldier, in what war have you fought?” the captain asked as we sailed through the swamp. I looked at the river ahead and mulled on the answer, the flies swarming all around us while the smell of rot hung in the air. The heat was almost unbearable this time of the year and I really did not care for it. “I fought the jungle war if that is what you are askin’ and honestly it wasn’t worth the money they paid. We weren’t fighting soldiers but village people who were defending their lands.”\n\nHe looked on knowing what I meant, he did not say anything till we reached the pier. There as I stepped out the boat he put a hand on my should and spoke “I know you don’t want to preached to but understand this brother, war is a cancer that will either kill you or eat you from within. I have seen too many die fighting wars long after the real ones ended. Take care and if you need a job you know where I am.” I nodded and left him standing there on the boat. I walked on the shaky pier to a man waiting at the end, he was a little overweight but the only person who knew how to make me laugh. “Look at the most sorry, dried up and hungry catfish I have ever laid my eye on. Come here so I can fatten that that useless body you keep hauling about.” I smiled, Jared was just an old friend but to me he was the only family I had.\n\n“I hope this time the meat will be soft, last time you made me eat leather and down it with piss water.” He laughed and gave me a bear hug before I could even move out. I smelled the cheap whisky on him and this brought back old memories. “Lissen, I make the best barbequed meat in this swamp and you know that, lass time was because the gator was old. I pro.. promise this time we will hunt something so you know it will be soft.”\n\n“Wait we are going hunting?”\n\n“Yup, hunting season ends today so this is the only chance you get to hunt some prime meat. You know how it is these days, the laws are changin’ and there’s nothing we can do about it.” I just stared at him, I was tired and needed a drink. Trust Jared to weasel out of a deal, he was supposed to pay for the first meal I had when I got back alive. Putting my rucksack down I stretched and felt all the joints crack like an old man then looked at his old pickup that I spent more time fixing than driving. It was still a shitbox but its all we had. Shaking my head I agreed and we were off to the hunting grounds. On the way I checked the old rifle we were to use and spoke about the war, Jared being an idiot acted like he just came back from the war rather than me but that suited me.\n\nOnce there we got out the truck and checked the rest of the gear and set out, I was tired but knew if I did not do this then I would be sleeping under the stars with the gators. We walked through the swamping marsh using a guide stick to make sure the ground was solid, it was a long trek to the hunting ground. We finally reached the spot and started to look for tracks or signs off any feral hogs, they had been breeding like crazy and the hunting season was them only. As he stalked further into the swamp forest I could not find an tracks but felt uneasy, the place was silent, too silent. It was as if the swamp was holding its breath for something, I kept my eyes and ears open to anything. As we made our way back to the truck I stopped and Jared almost fell into me, just as he was about to burst out I raised my hand silencing him. There was a sound coming from within the forest, it was faint at first but it was getting louder. I tried to listen but it was to far away and I had to stop just to pinpoint the location.\n\nJust as we were about to move forward a loud shriek was heard coming from our left, I turned to see what it was and raised my rifle on the ready. The trees were thick in that part of the swamp so I could not make out the source “h.. hey Mart, you ever heard about them banshees or somethun?”\n\nI turned to Jared and looked at him oddly, he in turn shrugged and continued “lissen I heard there is something in them woods that has been huntin’ peoples.”\n\nI shook my head, “so you decided to bring me here to do what, hunt the thing?”\n\n“No, this is our usual place. Look, that thing or the stories started just a couple of months ago. I didn’t pay it mind but …” just then the shriek came again and it was closer, we ran the other direction. Running through the trees and swamp was no easy task but we had to run, the shriek was getting louder and closer. I saw a ditch and pointed it to Jared and once we reached it we both dove in and scrambled up the side and held our breaths. We were both covered in mud and looking up at the entrance, the shriek came again and it was close. I heard flapping and within a second something swooped past our ditch that looked a shadow moving like an airplane. I was scared and could hear Jared whispering a broken prayer under his breath. We waited for what felt like hours before we moved again, I moved up the ditch to see if it was still around but the shrieking had gone and there was nothing around us. Jared curse and spoke about soiling himself, I told to shut it so I could listen. He then tried to get out the ditch and before I could stop him he was out and moving to the truck, it was maybe a mile away so I had to scramble after him as we practically ran to the truck. The shrieking returned and we now doubled our speed, reaching the truck Jared jumped into the passenger seat while I had no choice but to run around and get in the driver’s seat. Once inside I started the truck and gunned the gas, did not care where we were going but I needed to get the hell away from this place.\n\n“What in the actual fuck was that thing Jared, what hell is going on here. I leave for a couple of years and all of a sudden you guys have a devil in the swamp? What the fuck is going on?”\n\nJared was too scared to speak and kept looking at the back, his eyes were moving in every direction trying to find whatever that thing was. “Lissen I told you what I heard. Them Lewis boys told me about the thing, they said it was hunting people. I had no idea they was telling the truth, honest. We need to get out of here before we’re food for it.”\n\nI just looked ahead and drove, no idea where we were going but I was feeling better just being as far away I could from this thing. “So no one is hunting the thing?”\n\n“Last I heard was that old mama Betty said she would rustle up here people and try to catch the thing. I heard nothing after that, I kept myself out the picture ‘cause they was trying to enlist anyone to go hunting for that thing. Lissen Mart I had no idea it was all the way there, I thought it would be closer to the Marrows not here.”\n\n“Well its here now and we are fucked if we don’t find…” just then something slammed the truck from my side, I tried my best to keep the truck from crashing and I just managed while Jared had bent over crying like a child. I looked at the mirrors trying to find the thing while keeping the truck from flying of the road. It was no where to be seen, then I saw a shadow moving from behind and it slammed the truck from the rear. I kept the truck moving but knew that another slam might just tip the truck. I tried everything possible like moving the truck from side to side to help me from being slammed again. “Fuck, fuck, fuck, we are so fucked Mart.”\n\n“Shut the fuck up Jared, I am trying to keep us alive. The road was blur to me and so was everything else, I needed to get to town if we were to survive this. Bracing for another attack I kept the truck at a steady pace, after about 45 minutes we reached the town and I finally slowed down. I could see the lights of the town and houses, I was able to breath out finally. I sniffed the air in the truck and realised that Jared had actually shit his pants and I swore at him. One in town I stopped at the first bar we came across and I jumped out, only to realise how much mud was on me and I ran my hands over my face I could feel the thick clay flaking off. Looking at the damage on the truck I was blown away, the entire side the truck was bent inwards and so was the back. The truck looked like it had crashed into a tree.\n\n“Looks like the tree won there Martin, what happened?” I turned to see the speaker and found it was Benji, a local. “Something in the swamp hit the truck, I have no fucking idea but it was fast.”\n\nBenji looked at the damage closely as more people were now coming to see, I saw the local deputy also join the small crowd. Jared remained in the truck huddling in the seat like a scared child. “I wish I could say good to see you Martin but it seems you met our local boogey man. Can you tell me what happened?”\n\nI nodded but told him I need a beer and change of clothes first. The deputy nodded and pointed me to the motel across, I picked my rucksack from the back of the truck and picked Jared from the truck and followed the Deputy. He led us to the motel, sniffing the air even he realised that Jared had shit his pant and laughed. “Seriously Jared, here you preach about hunting the damn thing and when you met it you shit your pants?”\n\nJared was not amused but I could see he was shell shocked by the experience. Getting to the motel the Deputy got us a room so Jared and I could clean up, I had spare clothes but Jared on the other hand had to wait for his dad to bring them for him after the deputy called him. It felt good to finally have shower and put on some clean clothes, I left Jared in the room waiting for new clothes while I followed the deputy back to the bar.\n\nI gave him the full account on what happened, and he whistled at the end, we were joined by another deputy who just sat there stoic listening. “Whatever that fucking thing is I am sure happy that you survived it. We have been getting reports that people are going missing out there but no idea what was causing it. Well Martin we need more than a shotgun to get this thing.” I nodded to this but knew this wasn’t my war anymore. I was itching to leave now, leave this godforsaken swamp and find a better place away from the curses of this land."},"66":{"title":"Worked for a semi-famous criminal before he hit it big. He's not what you think.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k8wrmo\/worked_for_a_semifamous_criminal_before_he_hit_it\/","flair":null,"author":"str8aura","selftext":"This happened a while ago. I can't say my name, location, or the timeframe for obvious reasons. Just know I'm nowhere near that city again, and if you've followed the news, you probably are gonna figure out real quick which place I'm talking about.\n\nI was a thief, to be blunt. A burglar, ski mask and all, who'd steal things out of people's houses at night and resell them. Got sloppy one day. Went to jail for a few years, did my time, and came right back out. Unfortunately, that kind of stuff doesn't look good on a resume, so my bounceback wasn't going great. I knew in my heart I was probably gonna end up returning to stealing shit eventually. I just didn't expect such a good offer- not for someone as small scale as myself. Clearly, I impressed someone.\n\nThe job offer first came to me on a bus station bench in a light drizzle. I was the only one there, it was late, and we were both illuminated by a street lamp. A real picturesque scene if I do say so myself, straight out of a crime film. That was when I saw the suit for the first time, which my would-be boss came to meet me in person in. In case you haven't seen it, you really need to, because words don't do justice how creepy the fucking thing is.\n\nIt looks like it might have been a sports mascot or theme park character suit at one point; a purplish-pinkish dog, or bear or something, shaggy and clearly built for snotty little kids to give it hugs or whatever. Only instead of having a big care bears smile on its face, it just looks mildly depressed, like it's having a fucking mid-life crisis. Big white mesh eyes you're supposed to look out and a creased frown on his muzzle. Also, it looks much worse nowadays than it did when I first saw it, but lemme tell you it was never pretty. Even then it was dirty and ragged, missing patches of fur in places and covered in unknown substances in others. If it was ever washed, it was years before I ever came into contact with it.\n\nWhatever. Guy comes to meet me in the suit and tells me the deal. We hit up a couple places, him, me, and a few other guys he was contracting. We all wear the same suit, we try to talk as little as possible, and with luck the cops think it's all one guy. He basically admits to my face it's a herd mentality; if one of us gets caught, they close the case and the rest of us take what we've got and bounce. Brutal, but each of us was thinking the same thing; hey, at least it probably won't be me, right?\n\nOf course it was me. That's why I'm fucking writing this. You figured that part out already. I also never met any of the other people working for him, before you ask. All normal people like me, I'm sure.\n\nI don't want to wear the fucking thing, but even I have to admit it's a pretty good plan. Never really heard anything like it off the top of my head. So I agreed.\n\nHere's how it would work; I'd get a call on a day telling me to meet him somewhere, often a parking garage or the back lot of a gas station, the drug dealer usual suspects. The boss had a deep, gravelly voice, but always sounded weirdly calm, almost bored. Never once threatened me or told me I had 24 hours or whatever. Basically, his voice matched the face on the suit. He'd tell me what we were hitting, what to bring, where to bounce when you were done, where to stash the suit. And the whole time, of course, he was wearing it. I never brought it up, but it was pretty clear this guy didn't want me to know who he was. I speculated, of course, had my own pet theories about who was rich and stupid enough to do this scooby doo villain shtick (Rich because remember, he's really not getting much after all the cuts he has to make for the team members; a lot of people had a lot of irons in the fire for even a single job, not just the guy in the suit).\n\nI'm cruising, it's not bad for a bit. I'm not raking in hundreds of thousands, but it's not middling pennies either. Enough to keep the landlord off my ass, and I hide the remainder as a rainy day fund. Every once in a while I'd turn on the TV and find out about a suit job I hadn't been told about, which was fine by me, because I was still making money and nobody was looking for me specifically. I'm a bit of a lanky guy, and the suit's padded to look like a real bodybuilder must be under there. I'm way above suspicion.\n\nI also see a few of the jobs I'm not involved in include grabbing weapons; nothing heavy duty, but shit from rifle stores and the like. Keep that in mind.\n\nAnyway. The whole time I'm wondering who it is, but I honestly don't care enough to actually look into it and jeopardize my cushy opportunity I'll probably never get handed like this again in my life. Obviously that changed one day.\n\nI came to where I'm supposed to pick up the suit, an old apartment building that had been vacated ages back and was meant to be torn down soon. I come to the room he specified, and I guess I got there a little early, because he was still fucking there; every other time he's dipped before I got there, and I assumed he was leaving it there days in advance. Hours at least, to avoid running the risk of... y'know, *this* happening.\n\nHere's where I tell you I saw his face and he was a fuckin quasimodo, right? Super disfigured, terrifying zombie of a man? Nah. All I saw was him bending over, pulling the head off, and he was hunched over so low I couldn't even see his real head. I quickly ducked out because fuck that, I'm not even gonna risk getting a target painted on my back. Waited outside, listening for someone to leave. Nobody did. I waited as long as I could without fucking up our schedule (In case you've never played a videogame, getting in and out with your haul quickly is important in heists, especially when you're as conspicuous as a giant purple fucking bear) and then went in. There was the suit, sitting on the floor for me. No obvious exits. Whoever was in the suit vanished into the wind. Poof.\n\nWhatever. I don't have time to worry about it. I grabbed the suit and did the job.\n\nThat wasn't my last one for him. The next one was.\n\nJewelry store. Jared's, I think. I stop the car outside, charge in, hold the place up. Only one other guy in there, buying jewelry for someone. He goes down on the ground the same as the rest. Only thing is, when I'm holding up the girl at the register to empty the money she's got, I hear a buzz. I turn around, and he has the biggest 'oh shit' look on his face, holding his phone right next to his head on the ground. Motherfucker was smart enough to stealthily call the cops while I wasn't looking and stupid enough to not turn off his goddamn vibrate.\n\nI took a moment to think of what to do, whether I should ditch completely or just snatch his phone and put some more hustle into my step.\n\nI didn't have time to decide. The suit shot him.\n\nI know. I know. I've explained it a thousand times. Nobody ever believes me. I cannot stress it enough.\n\nThe suit. Shot him.\n\nI didn't move my arm. The heavy suit arm swung up independently, taking me with it. The fingers clenched around the handgun. With damned good accuracy, it hits and the poor guy's head explodes. A lot messier than I expected from such a dinky ass gun. It happened so fast, I couldn't even react at first, and just like that I was in control again. I dropped the gun. Snatched it up again, because evidence. Booked it.\n\nGot two steps before my feet stopped. My legs kept going, hitting against the suit's confines, but the bear paws were firmly rooted to the ground. Now that I had finally put two and two together, I realized I was stuck in the most idiotic fuzzy iron maiden ever devised. I was terrified out of my mind.\n\nThe suit stepped back. I had lost my breath and was too busy shitting my pants to say a word, so it probably looked like I had just had a sudden change of heart about leaving. Lifted the gun again. Unsurprisingly, the girl complied, and I left (of my own volition) with a full bag.\n\nAnd then got grabbed by cops on the drive back.\n\nI didn't even try to resist arrest. I only requested, once they pulled me out of the suit, that I be celled far away from it. I don't think they listened.\n\nTheir loss, unfortunately. Because after a while spent in the holding cell, only dimly aware that the suit had been taken into evidence, I heard a gunshot and the door opened again.\n\nThe suit stood in the door. He still didn't threaten me. He didn't say a word. He just walked up to me, dropped the gun in hand, and collapsed like a shirt falling off the hangar. All illusion of someone in there, wearing him, disappeared in a second. He was done pretending. He figured I got the message.\n\nI didn't want to go. I didn't want to go to jail again, but I wanted that a hell of a lot more than to ever get inside that thing again. Unfortunately, there was really no way to say no in that moment.\n\nI fled the station in the suit, taking back lots and alleys to the original site where I was supposed to dump him when I was done.\n\nWhen I did, just in case I might've thought the whole thing had a rational explanation, the suit spoke to me. Right as I had turned away to leave. All it did was thank me by name. That same gravelly voice I'd been hearing over the phone, coming out from somewhere inside the empty head.\n\nI fled to a place safer than my house. You're damn sure I deadlocked that fucker.\n\nThat's not the end of the story. The part everyone knows is next, the very next day. The Suited Freak's attack on the Family Which Shall Not Be Named. A family of the Scorcese-Godfather type, except less Italian from what I remember of them. The group with the biggest control over drug and weapon trade in the area, manned by the huge asshole I had spent a good portion of my life trying not to meet.\n\nHow he disappeared, and was replaced with a new guy. And you'll never guess what outfit the new guy was never seen outside of.\n\nI got the hell out of dodge, grabbing my rainy day savings and only making one last call right before I chucked my phone off a bridge. I had a friend with some connections to that group, and I asked if he knew what had happened specifically. My accounting is thirdhand. I don't know if it's true. I don't know why I wouldn't believe it at this point.\n\nAccording to him, Suit Freak attacked the family's house out of nowhere, using all the weapons he had stocked up. Took every bullet without budging. Punches or rifle smacks were even more useless. In about an hour, he tore through every bodyguard until he reached the head in his bedroom. The recounter supposedly only survived by playing dead, and happened to catch what happened next sideways on the floor, surrounded by his dead mates.\n\nSuit Freak came up to the patriarch in his bed. Took his own head off.\n\nThe family's adult son was inside. They didn't know if he had been alive inside there before the attack, but he had taken every single bullet fired at the bear personally.\n\nSuit Freak let his father stay alive just long enough to see what had been done, how he had won his victory, and then shot him in the head without a word.\n\nSuit's still the most prolific criminal over there now. Police still haven't figured out how the hell to catch him. They're even fairly certain he's been using his new resources to make duplicate suits to carry out multiple jobs at the same time. I doubt any of them are like he is, or at least I sure hope not, because if that thing can reproduce we might as well just give up now.\n\nI suspect I know his worst case scenario plan for if he's ever caught; hide someone's body inside himself again beforehand, some prolific criminal he can pin it all on. Let them think they shot and killed him, then go into hiding. The same plan he had when I worked for him, only without bothering to get the corpse's consent anymore.\n\nThere's so many places, I imagine, an inanimate costume can fly under the radar."},"67":{"title":"My Childhood Nightmares Came Back. This Time, I Woke Up with Bruises. [Part 1]","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k96w4y\/my_childhood_nightmares_came_back_this_time_i\/","flair":"Series","author":"PotentialPhase7966","selftext":"[Final Part](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kabal9\/my_childhood_nightmares_came_back_this_time_i\/)\n\nA few nights ago something started to bother me. It began as a nameless anxiety while I brushed my teeth. The feeling escalated as I stared at my trembling hands. I lost control of my breathing, and when I looked into the mirror I saw another’s face staring back in place of my own–my father’s. Foreign words ran through my mind in the shape of unintelligible mutterings as I traced my shaky fingers across the features that I hadn’t seen in years.\n\nAbove my shoulder I saw the shower curtain crumple violently, and the words in my head were drowned out by violent laughter. The next moment, I collapsed.\n\nWhen I regained consciousness, I found the bathroom in ruins–words were choppily etched all over the walls as if the paint were torn by fingernails;\n\n“STATIC. LIGHT. MOVIE. BURIED IN YOUR BODY. WARM. COLD. FLIES. VOMIT. COME BACK. YOU FOLLOW. HANDS. THROAT. ALONE SUDDENLY ALONE SUDDENLY ALONE. FLIES. BREATH IN. FLIES. DON’T LEAVE. COME BACK.”\n\n\\---\n\nWhen I was ten and a half, my father died. His gravestone read:\n\n*In loving memory of Joseph Michael Calhoun*\n\n*Dedicated Son, Brother, Father, and Husband.*\n\n*‘In our youth, we fly…*\n\n*I have come to much prefer the nest.’*\n\n*1965-2007*\n\nThe quote came from a poem he wrote just before my sister’s birth titled, “Into the Rising Sun.”\n\nHe wrote a lot–poetry, short stories, love letters–really I think he just liked to read his own words, we all did. If he had his way the gravestone may have been able to fit a few chapters on it, but his death was sudden, and his mind was the first part of him to go.\n\nMany nights my mother would sleep downstairs; I was always so certain it was because he was tucked in that dark room to work on a story for me, with one gentle, flickering light to guide him. Often, if this seemed to be the case, I would try and peek in to see what he was writing; I could never hear the keyboard though, it was always drowned out by some humming white noise. I only remember seeing the light lunge across the room, my one sign that my father was there.\n\n\\---\n\nAt only ten and a half years old, I lost far more than just a father. In his passing, he took with him my idol, my caretaker, and, possibly his most selfish choice, he took away my chance to hear all he had to say.\n\nEvery weekend we would stay up as late as we could watching his favorite old tv shows, or reading his favorite books–we did just about anything we could together. I couldn’t part from his side, and he never left mine. It’s a difficult relationship to relay, I’ve spent most of my life without him but even now I see him in every little thing. I can hear the way he would describe the most mundane things with such magic. I fell in love with his world and felt so lucky that he invited me into it. Just as fully as I feel his presence, I continue to feel his loss. The pain remains the sharpest of my whole life, yet I wouldn’t trade a thing in the world for our memories together.\n\nI ran home from his funeral; I couldn’t stand to see him sealed away in front of my eyes–forever unreachable. In search of a single thing that could draw me closer to him, I tore apart the boxes of his belongings that my mother just recently moved to the attic.\n\nWhile my family said goodbye to him I desperately clung on. I fought through a storm of tears, until finally something turned up; a letter for my sister, inscribed:\n\n*I love you, my Angeline. In this letter I give you a piece of myself, in case I one day leave you.*\n\nI couldn’t justify taking the letter away from Angie, despite my every selfish urge to destroy it. I put it back where I found it, but only after I transcribed it–if only just to make sure I never lost his words. This was a false promise to myself, as days later I tore my copy apart in one of my many fits of rage–my mourning was not gentle. One piece remained intact, though, the beginning of the poem;\n\n**Into the Rising Sun**\n\n*Dedicated to my Angel*\n\n*Many years ago, the Moon was formed, a piece of the Earth.*\n\n*Many years ago, the Moon found its footing, creating the tides.*\n\n*The Sun sat patiently, bearing witness to beauty beyond comparison.*\n\n*So it began, an endless waltz between these three celestial bodies*\n\n*The Sun brought warmth, despite being forever separated from the other two*\n\n*The Moon brought balance, despite being fated to remain incomplete, only a drifting piece of the Earth*\n\n*The Earth, paying back its companions, brought life-*\n\nOnly a few weeks ago I found the scrap buried in an old writing notebook from high school. I thought back to a lesson during my astronomy elective in college; the Moon was created when an asteroid struck the Earth, breaking off tremendous debris. This debris, all magma and rock, slowly fell into itself, forming into a giant chunk of the Earth, now bound to orbit its life giver perfectly, forever separate. I’m certain it longs to return, to become part of the Earth again; what suffering it must experience in its incompleteness.\n\nIt took a long time for my mother to find Angie’s letter; she refused to look through Dad’s stuff until I was stable enough to help. Having hidden it so long ago, it took me a few minutes to realize that it had been missing from where I left it, then I noticed the corner of an envelope sticking from her sweatshirt pocket. She saw the recognition in my face and asked what was wrong, but I just told her,\n\n“Give her that letter, Mom.” I was furious–I couldn’t believe that she was trying to hide it, but more than anything, I couldn’t believe that I was arguing to give it to Angie. My baby sister was too young to understand, but I had left it in the attic for a reason.\n\nShortly after, I began to read constantly; first I poured through every piece of paper left in my father’s wake, reading many of them over and over until the paper began to stain and crease. Once it became a concern that I would damage or devalue these prized possessions, I moved on to other forms of literature, exploring some of the many influences my father made reference to. As my knowledge of the literary world grew, so did my prowess as a writer. I especially enjoyed writing prose, and at many points, free-form poetry–I learned my style from my father’s. Despite this, I felt my work was entirely inadequate in the shadow of his legacy.\n\nAt night, even now, I ask myself if my life has amounted to anything other than chasing a ghost. Muddy, distant memories of our relationship before his death are all that remain, some of which are, to put it pleasantly, unfortunate. In his best times, he was a life raft upon which the whole world could float. It would be impossible to truly claim that this was the majority of the time, but I remember the good far more than I do the bad. On occasion, however, I can see the image of his face, sunken, pale against the unlit void of my parents room. More memorable is the stench from the room in times when he would refuse to leave the bed for days.\n\n\\---\n\nTwo weeks after the funeral, my mother took my sister and I to visit the grave. I felt ready. My mother held my hand in her left, hoisting a sweet, chubby-armed Angie up with her right arm. I can still see her wandering, wide-eyed expression on our walk through the aging plots. In my memories her shallow breaths, giggles, babblings, and whispers are an overture played over grainy B-roll footage. This film plays through my head often, always in the same order; \n\n*I see countless monuments to the dead, their lettering cruelly washed away by time, leaving stones that do little more than remind me that my dad’s words will go away one day too; Angie being set down to crawl; my mother attempting to stifle an expression that took me many years to understand. Directly after seeing her steely, confusingly furious gaze, I see the coastal sky hanging over the tips of impossibly tall white pines. I hear my sister giggling.* \n\n*Averting my eyes from the gloomy sky, I take in an unfortunate sight–the most vivid piece of this memory: my mother’s expression has collapsed. Her quivering lip and her tear-battered cheeks stand in stark contrast to the stillness of her body, as if all of her humanity existed only in those cascading tears and the lip that fought valiantly to hold back the screams of a fresh widow. She was left behind, a mother of two, a grieving wife, and, more than anything else, a person forced to mourn her best friend. Angie’s babbling words echo in my ears.* \n\n*Then, I look to see what may have caused this overwhelming shift in Mom’s demeanor, and see nothing but the stone that has my father’s words engraved into it. Angie coos, seeking attention.*\n\n*Unable to understand what had upset Mom so suddenly, I thought I may cheer her up by doing an impression of my father–I had become a real talent at replicating his voice in the many hours I spent clinging to him. Maybe I was learning about sentence structures at the time, or simply liked the way it looked, whatever it was that lead me to read his words doesn’t matter.* \n\n*In our youth, we fly…*\n\n*I have come to much prefer the nest.*\n\n*I see my mother turn her face to me, her features obscured and unrecognizable. I have never been able to recall that expression.*\n\nMost often, I lose track of the memory here, with my father’s words, *my words*, echoing in my mind for days afterwards. Oddly, I do not hear it as a boy’s imitation, but instead, my father’s actual voice, somehow weathered and extremely comforting.\n\n\\--\n\nFor some time after our visit to Dad’s grave the memory appeared only as a dream, but it deviated from the actual morning significantly. Of the many fabrications that a dream is bound to incorporate, I only remember the following changes with any clarity.\n\n*I stand with my family, but only I notice the foul odor of death riding along the wind–the smell of damp, rotting flesh. Instead of staring into the gloomy sky, I stare deeply into the woods, unable to break eye contact with something hidden within them.*\n\nThis portion of the dream often seemed to last for hours. I would never wake up without completing the dream, leaving me stuck.\n\n*I can’t move, feeling as though some invisible hand is latched around my wrist. It tugs against my arm, trying to pull me into the gaps between the pines.*\n\n*In these gaps, a sort of shifting is occurring.*\n\nIn my best description, given to a therapist years ago, the empty space sat in complete darkness, like a curtain that was perfectly fitted between each tree, leading all the way to their peaks.\n\n*On the other side of this perfect veil, millions of small, unidentifiable, buzzing creatures attempt to escape. With endless force they work to drive themselves through the curtains, but they fail each night, no matter how long they try. Each one moves independently, trying different angles and squeezing against each other. As the curtain swells, I see the shape of a human face pressing against it, nearly ten feet up.*\n\nI was unable to even speak about this dream at the time. I would wake up still able to smell the stench of the bodies. My wrist was constantly sore during the period that I suffered these nightmares. At the time a doctor examined me, whispering to my mother that the sensitivity I felt indicated some trauma, but it was dismissed as a boyish injury. It took me years to rationalize that the lingering effects of my dream were psychosomatic–the brain’s influence on the body is far stronger than we realize.\n\nDespite being aware of the nightmare’s insignificance, a therapist I attended in my teens urged me to explain the feelings in the best wording I could. We worked together to journal my explanation, which was as follows;\n\n*Imagine; you are paralyzed, stuck with a cold, concrete floor against your back.  Above your head hangs a thin sheet, strung up at its corners by rusty hooks. Pounds of chubby, writhing larvae begin raining down onto the sheet, pressing weightily into the fabric. More, and more, and more. Slowly, the corners of the sheet begin to tear, the fabric no longer able to bear the increasing mass of fleshy, wriggling grubs.*\n\n*By now, you’re unsure if you would even survive the massive weight if it were to collapse. Meanwhile, you remain entirely incapable of moving, or defending yourself, or even closing your eyes. The sheet does not collapse, though; it stretches impossibly, yields endlessly to the weight without buckling under it.*\n\n*This process goes on for hours, you are now certain it would kill you, but not by crushing you–now you believe that you’ll be suffocated underneath a mountain of these festering things.*\n\n*It will not be quick; you come to the conclusion that a pile of larvae would definitely be porous enough to allow for pockets of air. Instead of simply suffocating you by denying you access to the air, the maggots would provide a much harsher fate.*\n\n*Looking to escape the mountainous pressure from the pile above them, the maggots would crawl into your nose, preventing you from breathing comfortably and you would begin to panic. Your desperate struggle for air would cause you to reflexively open your mouth, even if just the tiniest bit. Immediately, you would feel a few of the writhing grubs fall through your lips as you struggle for air–their bitter, mucus drenched skin worsening your reaction. As your mouth continues to fill, you would choke, sucking them into your throat. Still choking, but now on their fleshy bodies, you begin hacking up larvae. No matter how many you expel, they climb back down, deeper, deeper, deeper.*\n\n*Of course, the sheet still hasn’t actually broken.*\n\nAfter enough time, however, the torture of waiting becomes tantamount to the suffocation itself. If, per say, I slept for 9 hours, I would estimate that I dreamt for almost the whole time, and almost all of that time was spent waiting, terrified that the curtain would fall. That I would suffocate, choke to death upon whatever was hiding in the dark.\n\n\\--\n\nMost nights I would wet the bed; I struggled with my appetite, I became hostile, lashing out at anyone around me. I would love to say that it was just my grief, but I was consumed by fear of that monster in the dark.\n\nI stopped going to school in this period, my mother felt that I wouldn’t handle peer interactions well and thought it best to allow me to process in the comfort of my home. In some ways, she must have done it just as much for herself as she did it for me; although it was certainly bittersweet, my resemblance to my father and my incessant imitation of his every characteristic was of still a piece of comfort in a house that felt so empty in his absence. His vacancy weighed on us as though we had only ever been aware of his company–my own mother felt alien to me. Angie was blissfully unaware of our troubles but she must have felt the palpable emptiness, even if she couldn’t have recognized it.\n\nMy night terrors only lasted for a few weeks but I would say that these were, markedly, the worst weeks of my life.  \n\\--\n\nThe other night, after I collapsed in the bathroom, I fell asleep only to “awaken” in the cemetery. Years after I escaped it, the hand found me again, ready to call me back into the woods. \n\n*In my dream I walk down the path, once again a child, experiencing the same procession that I did on that fateful day. This time, though, I can hear the buzzing from behind the curtains well before reaching the plot. My wrist begins to ache in anticipation of the hand’s steel grip. I try so desperately to avert my gaze from the gaps in the pines, but my effort is fruitless.*\n\n*Beneath me, my feet begin to tread towards the woods, as the trees grow taller and taller. The sky slowly disappears, shrouded behind the canopy. I shout at my legs to stop, yet they continue. After an eternity I arrive at the edge of the woods, the swelling curtains reaching out, inches from my face. Well above me, the face–outlined by the curtains–looks stoically forward.*\n\n*I stand in anticipation, my hearing beginning to dull from the cacophony of bestial noises born mere inches in front of me. The stench fills my nose as my eyes peer up–the canopy seems to still grow, and only a tiny bit of the sky remains.*\n\n*The hand finally joins me, brushing gently against my cheek. Slowly, I feel the fingers wrap around my throat. My pulse throbs, veins stifled by the meaty fingers. The grip brings an unbearable pressure–bit by bit my windpipe collapses. Like sucking all of the air out of a plastic water bottle; the plastic crumples until, ultimately, it becomes a shriveled, twisted mess–a completely alien form. Equally alien to its original shape, my windpipe is distorted and crumpled, the little air passing through my throat catching against the sharp angles of my trachea.*\n\n*I struggle to hold my head up as my seizing neck muscles give into the pressure and lose all strength. With a snap, I fall limp and my vision turns sideways. My head is held on by nothing more than my tattered throat, a bungee cord on which my skull bobbles back and forth. The hand, trembling with some concealed fury, worsens this effect. I feel my inhuman neck elongate and contract in reaction to the angered shaking of my lifeless body.* \n\n*My vision–hazy from experiencing a level of pain entirely new to me–bounces in tandem with my head’s movement. My eyes largely point to the ground, but occasionally I get a look in a random direction. I look to the grey, far off shimmer of sky; it fights to reach me through the sprawling canopy. After a few excruciating moments, my vision then crosses the face above me, still stoic against the curtain. Then, just as I begin to realize that I may never escape the hand’s grasp, my eyes land upon my father’s grave.*\n\n*Suddenly I regain control of my body–my arms reflexively pry at the massive fingers to no effect. Weakly, I reach toward the curtain, hoping to make any attempt for my life. Before I can tear it open the hand throws me down. My head slams violently against a root.* \n\n*I look up to see the shape of the face, high above me, look down as it begins to smile. On the verge of death, the sound of my own sobbing fails to reach my ears, impossibly quiet in comparison to the hum of the millions of unseen things behind the curtain. I feel a warm liquid pool in my crotch.*\n\n*The curtain now stretches to accommodate a human figure, seemingly attached to the face far above me. Its proportions are inconceivable; it is not simply “too tall” to be real, each part of it seems to be a poorly done rendition of the human figure. It’s more similar to crayon drawings–misshapen and far from anatomical–than it is to any natural being. As it pushes itself closer to me I hear the curtain tear, my eyes quickly shut to avoid whatever was coming. I feel a warm hand against my cheek–reflexively my eyes open. Only inches in front of my face is another. In a flash, I see a set of kind, watering eyes. I refuse to look below them; although hazy in my periphery, I know that if I do, my gaze will meet with a set of snarling teeth hanging loosely from an unhinged jaw. So instead, I stare deeply into the eyes, coming to recognize them–they were his.*\n\nI woke up. Tearing my way out of bed, I found the bathroom and flipped on the lights. I struggled to recognize my reflection–my face was covered in a mix of blood and salty tears, and beneath, my throat was host to extensive bruising, the marks all at least eight or nine inches long, making up the loose shape of fingers. Grime and dried blood piled under my broken fingernails, pushing them up off of my nail beds and threatening to tear them away entirely; or perhaps their displacement was a result of whatever led them to get chipped, torn, and bloodied in the first place. \n\nI spent the day locked in my bathroom in a fetal position. The stench of my piss-drenched pajama pants filled the air as I begged for help, uncertain who would ever be able to hear me. A cough lingered from being strangled. Every gurgling choke brought with it blood and a frothy white substance, almost like a baby’s spit up. I gently cleaned my scruffy five-o-clock shadow as memories of my father’s scratchy facial hair flow through my mind. \n\nEach time I coughed I worried that my head may fall to the side, my neck suddenly giving in to the pressure of that beckoning figure from beyond the woods.\n\nI laid on the cold tile floor until night returned. In a brief moment of lucidity I decided to gather myself to take a shower. If I was going to sleep again, at the very least I could fall asleep clean, if only to feel slightly more grounded. By then the bruising on my neck had purpled, sensitive to the touch. Before getting in I washed my hands, staring intently down at my fingernails as I cleaned the grime from underneath. I pulled apart the chipped remains with clippers, wincing as I ripped off more than just nail.\n\nMy task now completed, I looked in the mirror–behind me the shower curtain began to swell forward, emanating the familiar stench, paired with the pestering sound of what I could only imagine were countless insects. \n\nI refused to turn around and face this monster. I would go to bed dirty. More than anything, I needed to keep moving rather than accept that my reality was shattering–the monster found its way out of my dream. As I exited the bathroom I chose to ignore the set of eyes I saw in the mirror, peeking curiously from the shower, nestled in the dark. I also chose to ignore the familiar, timid laughter it emitted.\n\nI couldn’t trust that I was really seeing anything at all. My delirium was notably worse than in my childhood, but not totally new to me; I know my mind is capable of tricking me into whatever it wants. Besides, I was already confident in what I had to do to fix this.\n\n\\--\n\nThen, I had the dream for the second time.\n\nAnd last night, a third. I’ve woken up bruised and bloodied, unable to recuperate.\n\nI caught a last minute flight from JFK to Boston thinking that whatever was going on could only be settled at my family home. I can’t quite explain the feeling; perhaps I simply acted on instinct, unsure whether my hallucinations were becoming increasingly powerful or if some unseen force had actually been bringing this misery upon me, but nonetheless confident that the solution was there at home, waiting.\n\nMy sister is in her first semester at a local community college–her life path has been entirely opposite my own. Having never truly known my father, she was left to struggle with his absence, but not the loss of him as a person. If anything, she spent her life just as jealous that I had known him as I was for the fact that he wrote her a letter. \n\nShe was successful throughout school, had friends, and generally lived a fulfilling youth. She made the plan to stay at home for her first two years of college out of a sense of responsibility to my mother, who faced a rapid decline in her mental health almost immediately when my sister and I were both old enough to take decent care of ourselves.\n\nI felt little responsibility for that. It was simply not an option to live in the overwhelming absence of my father. \n\nAt the airport I called my sister–no answer–and then my mother, who picked up after a single ring. I asked if anyone was home; after assuring her that everything was alright and that I just needed to look through some of my old possessions, she told me that she and my sister were there and excited to see me.\n\nI packed my duffle into the passenger seat of my rental. For two hours I navigated the Maine coast, reminiscing on many drives from my youth. I pulled up to the house, it was exactly the same as I left it. By now it was nearly eleven at night, but I could make out every detail of the house under the illumination of the streetlight–a subject of earlier childhood nightmares, the oddly tall streetlight would spend each night staring through the cracks in my curtains as I slept. If I was struggling to sleep, I would ask my father to sleep with me–the nightmares always went away. My troubled sleeping habits aside, I found the streetlight comforting after all of this time. In a strange way, the return of the dream made me sentimental, and the sight of the house ushered back memories, good and bad, but all worth having.\n\nInside I was met with a look of shock on my sister’s face rather than her usual reaction–unmasked resentment. “You look like shit, did you crash on your way here?”\n\n“Do you have the letter Dad left you?”\n\nA familiar look came across her face–simultaneously readying her defense of her letter and openly pitying my lack of one.\n\n“Is *that* why you came here?”\n\n“Angie, why do you care? Did Mom ever tell you about my dreams? I know you were young, but she must have mentioned them.” My frantic questioning visibly unnerved her.\n\n“Listen–you need to grow up. Mom brings you up all the time. She already lost Dad, why are you leaving her? And *yes*, JJ” she said dismissively,  “she mentioned them. She’s always been worried about you, and if she knew you were talking about Dad’s letters again? How would she feel? She already told you, there isn’t anything for you in them.”\n\n“Them?” I asked.\n\n“I mean… in the letters we got–Mom and I. JJ, I’m sorry that he didn’t write you one or whatever but you should be happy, why do you need to hold onto an imaginary letter from a man who couldn’t be bothered to see you grow up? Just drop it, okay?” With this final point, she let out a frustrated grunt and then looked away, immediately regretting what she said.\n\n“Please, Angie. I promise I won’t let Mom know that this is why I came back, just let me see the letter, I’m begging you.”\n\nSighing, the same deep, frustrated sigh she always did when I’d complain about the letters, she said, “Fine–but you have to make sure she thinks you just wanted to come home to see us and grab some stuff, and please hide those bruises–there’s makeup in my room.”\n\nWaiting until I was alone, I read over it again hoping to quell the resurgence of the dream.\n\n\\--\n\nThus far, I have failed to explain two things: the full contents of the letter, and the nature of my first time reading it. In a moment I will transcribe it, but first I would like to explain my urgency in retrieving it, and what really happened upon my first read-through.\n\nIn the attic, rummaging through boxes of Dad’s stuff that were tucked away only a week prior, I found the envelope. I instantly ripped it open, tearing away a seal that was not mine to break. The words left for my sister were clearly not meant for me, though no amount of shame could have stopped me from reading them. My anxious scanning was pointless, the words left for Angie meant nothing to me. As a result there was no revelation to stop my dreams; quite the opposite in fact, it became an entirely new hurt to see his deep love for Angie instead of me. I hid the letter back where I found it, unsure why I felt the need to.\n\nThat night, I fell asleep feeling far worse than I had any night in the past month. To my surprise, I experienced a night without bad dreams, or any dreams at all. From that point on I slept at night–every night–without a single dream, this relief lasted until the nightmares returned. It only felt natural, then, that reading the letter *should* help me move forward again.\n\nTears began to well as I, years later, reread words; “I love you, my Angeline. In this letter I give you a piece of myself, in the case of my passing.” The envelope had wilted slightly over its lifetime, splotches of discoloration were left behind from the tears I shed over it as a child.\n\nSo here it is, written just before my sister’s birth, over eighteen years ago;\n\n**Into the Rising Sun**\n\n*Dedicated to my Angel*\n\n*Many years ago, the Moon was formed, a piece of the Earth.*\n\n*Many years ago, the Moon found its footing, creating the tides.*\n\n*The Sun sat patiently, bearing witness to the formation of the Earth and the Moon.*\n\n*So it began, an endless waltz between these three celestial bodies*\n\n*The Sun brought warmth, despite being forever separated from the other two*\n\n*The Moon brought balance, despite being fated to remain incomplete, only a drifting piece of the Earth*\n\n*The Earth, paying back its companions, brought life, if only to allow them to witness its beauty*\n\n*Inseparable, now, these three companions have continued their dance for eternity.*\n\n*Many, many years later, I saw the sky.*\n\n*In my first life, I was a bird, soaring above endless expanses of land.*\n\n*For many years I refused to look down,*\n\n*I exhausted my wings, flying upward*\n\n*Into the Rising Sun*\n\n*My wings burned, my feet ached for land, and so*\n\n*I descended from the heavens*\n\n*And found another bird, one so beautiful that I forgot the sky entirely*\n\n*And she said to me,*\n\n*“In our youth, we fly…*\n\n*But should we continue?”*\n\n*Without a second thought, I answered*\n\n*“No, these wings have brought me here,*\n\n*I think they should rest.”*\n\n*And so, I stopped chasing those tragic stars.*\n\n*It was a quiet life, but I took pride in that.*\n\n*Not once did I miss the Sun or the Moon.*\n\n*I realized something, though*\n\n*Retiring from flight had broken me down,*\n\n*Made my body weaken.*\n\n*Going against my nature had come at the cost of my life,*\n\n*I felt it slipping away as my body grew cold.*\n\n*As I sat, for many hours pondering how to confront my fate,* \n\n*I felt the warmth of the sun, and it was the next step towards* ***our*** *life.*\n\n*Before departing, I simply told my companion*\n\n*“In our youth, we fly…*\n\n*I have come to much prefer the nest.”*\n\nIn an attached letter, he wrote:\n\n*My dear Angeline,*\n\n*I look forward to meeting you,* *more than anything*\\*. In my heart exists a space that has, for my entire life, been empty. Upon the arrival of your brother my heart began to fill, and now it is your task to complete me. Thank you, for everything you are and everything you will become. As I write this I am next to my beloved Catherine, “Mom” to you…\\*\n\n*Consider yourself lucky, you will grow up with the most compassionate, talented, brilliant, and beautiful woman as your mother. At her side, old “Pa” will be patting himself on the back for helping to make such a beautiful family. So while you feel lucky to have your Mom, just remember that I am the luckiest man in the whole world.*\n\n*In the last few months your brother has begun asking all sorts of questions about you; “Who will she be? What does she like? Can I be her best friend?” He smiles endlessly, although I have been doing just the same. In fact, the whole world has begun to brighten, anticipating your arrival.*\n\n*For the first time in my life, I feel as though I am at a loss for words. By the time you read this you’ll probably find the idea of my wordlessness to be pretty amusing; I cannot wait to prattle on to you about just about anything.*\n\n*I suppose I should recognize the unfortunate truth of this letter. I will leave you one day, and although that may feel a tremendous loss to you, it will be far worse for me. My life will only start when I hold you, when my heart is filled. Yours will go on, long past mine. Some days will be unbelievable, and those days will become cherished memories (of which I hope to be in a few); others will be far from perfect, but I promise you, with all of my strength, that I will be your support, your rock, and anything else you ever need. Someday, when I depart, you will no longer need me. On that day, you will realize that I was nothing more than a port, and now your ship is prepared to sail. At your side will be your brother.*\n\n*Please protect him.*\n\n*By the time you read this, I hope you’ll understand why I ask that of you.*\n\n*So here they are, my first words to you, and my last.*\n\n*Thank you, my joy and pride, my cherished daughter, my Angeline. Thank you for joining us, we are truly lucky to have you. The sun has never shone this brightly, nor has the wind ever smelled so sweet. The world is ready, I hope that you are as well. I love you for eternity.*\n\n*With love,*\n\n*Dad.*\n\nAnd then, he left. He left me, my mom, and my sister–he said goodbye to them. I never did read what he left my mother, she didn’t keep it for very long.\n\n\\--\n\nI poured over the words left for Angie in my head. I thought about the Moon. What a fate; forever unable to do anything but sit in awe of its creator. \n\nAs my mind wandered aimlessly, a timid knock at the bedroom door jolted me into reality. It slowly opened with the aged hands of my mother wrapping around its edges.\n\n“What’s up, Mom?”\n\n“Hi, Honey–” She quickly interrupted herself, and instead chose to walk toward the bed, gently setting herself down at the foot.\n\nI loosened the blankets, sitting up to meet her wavering eyes. “Is everything alright? You don’t look like yourself, why are you even up?”\n\n“He was a really great man, really great. You know he loved you, right?”\n\nStunned, I shifted further up the bed, stiffening my back against the wall. As I did so, I saw a sudden turn in her expression, now surprised.\n\n“JJ, you look so much like him–”\n\nFully aware of her meaning and concerned she knows exactly why I came back, I sheepishly asked, “Mom, what’s going on with you? Are you talking about Dad? I don’t really look like him, and I’m honestly not sure why you’re suddenly looking to talk about him.” \n\nMy tone, doctored to appear innocent and unaware, came out less coy than I had intended; again, her face was contorted, now some vague feeling beyond surprise was aimed at me.\n\n“Please, you know why I’m thinking about him. I can tell the dreams are back, have you looked in a mirror? Honey, you know what the doctors said, it's not real.”\n\n“Mom–” before I could say anything more, she spoke over me.\n\n“You really have grown up. It’s okay to talk about him, I promise. I don’t mind that you miss him, you’d be silly not to.”\n\n“Do–do you?” I had given up on hiding it, she knew, and soon my sister would be aware that I violated our promise. Not that it was particularly important, though, I had already gotten what I wanted.\n\n“Honey, he died a long ti–”\n\n“Mom, he wrote me a letter, right? He had to have left me something, right?”\n\nAs a child I made a habit of abruptly springing into this line of questioning nearly every day, she would always reply in the same calm tone, “I’ve told you a billion times, there was no letter.” \n\nThe first time I ever asked, though, she told me something else; “I’m sorry my love, but I’m sure he knew that you’d be alright without him. Look at you, what could he tell you with words that you don’t already know? Honey, you’re just like–well, you’re so.. *similar*. You’ve been by his side since birth, he chose to trust that you would find what you needed in your memories, rather than simple words…” I was particularly frustrated by this–if we were so close, wouldn’t I deserve a letter more than anyone?\n\nFor longer than seemed possible, we sat in the silent presence of one another, remembering the years of hardship brought to mind by this familiar conversation. \n\nShe adjusted on the bed, now looking directly at me for the first time. In the quiet of my childhood bedroom, under the watchful gaze of the streetlight, she found a new response. With an excruciatingly cold tone, as if reciting a script, she told me; \n\n“He loved you, more than he did me or your sister, more than he *could have* loved us. If you don’t realize that, you really have no idea how much you meant to him. But you should know that it was hard for him, I guess, to see so much of himself in you. I never really understood why, but it hurt him–over time it began to make more sense to me than I would like to admit. Can’t you just be happy knowing that even his wife was jealous of how much he loved you? What would a letter do for you, you had him all to yourself when he was alive.”\n\nWith that, she got up and left. As she walked out I couldn’t help but think how much more present she was; it was as if her aging was reversed, just for a moment. Maybe I’ve taken too long to say this, but yes, I did know my father loved me. It was never really a concern to me, honestly. More than anything, I couldn’t believe that I would spend the rest of my life without him–at the very least, I could have had a final memory to hold onto. It made no sense to deny me that little kindness. I couldn’t understand how quickly he left, nor could I heal until his absence was any easier to swallow.\n\nNow, laying in bed and writing this out, I know that this monster is ready for me. I have my headphones on, but the quiet laughter coming from the window curtains is unaffected by my attempt to drown it out. \n\nIt seems like no explanation will really make anything better. I’ll plan to update you all tomorrow, maybe by then someone out there will be able to give me some peace of mind on all of this–maybe I’ll have fixed it myself."},"68":{"title":"My aunt owns a thrift shop.

She closed the door, locked it, muttered to herself *“damn 343 and its eavesdropping,”* and then took a seat at her desk. “I’m sorry. I should’ve told you everything sooner,” she said, looking at the three of us grimly.\n\n“You think?” I snapped.\n\nI instantly regretted saying that, from the guilty expression on her face. *What’s wrong with you?* I scolded myself. Aunt Gigi could’ve been indirectly responsible for killing us all, but one heartfelt apology and guilty look and I want to forgive her for everything.\n\n“Do I really have to tell your friends, too?” she asked, looking skeptically at Kira and Elias.\n\n“They saw everything, so, yeah. Besides, I’d say you owe me.”\n\nShe sighed. “Okay. The thrift shop has been in my husband’s family for generations. I think I’m the first person not related by blood to run it, though. No one expected him to die so young.” She sighed and put her elbows up on the desk. “There was actually a bit of a legal battle, where his uncle wanted to take it from me. But the will clearly left it to me. That was before I knew what it really was, of course… I would’ve gladly given it to his uncle if I knew.” She shook her head.\n\nKira plopped down on the floor, criss-cross applesauce. Elias leaned against the back wall, looking tall and brooding, like he was thinking deep thoughts. Knowing him, though, he was probably just thinking about the classification of spiders or something.\n\nAunt Gigi glanced to each of us, one by one, frowning. “So, there are…” she paused for a while, and then went with: “…*people* on this earth that need to buy things that are a little… *different.* Some of the things sold here are dangerous, but it’s better if they’re vetted and regulated. There’s an entire Board for supernatural objects that I have to report to. They tell me which things I’m allowed to sell, and which ones I need to send back to them. Let me see…” She grabbed a book off the bookshelf behind her and thumbed through it. “Here’s one I had to send back to them.\n\nShe slid the book towards me.\n\n*Entity #824*\n\n*Class V*\n\n*Presentation: #824 is a pewter fork. It is six inches long, one-twelfth of an inch thick, and three-quarters of an inch wide at its widest point. It has five tines and weighs one-point-eight ounces. It has the imprint of a man’s face on the top of the handle, which has its mouth wide open, as if screaming.*\n\n*Safety Precautions: When #824 is inactive, it is harmless and can be handled using Class I Safety Precautions. #824 is activated when the tines come into contact with any solid or liquid with a water content of over thirty percent. In one case, it was observed to activate in air, when humidity reached eighty-three percent (Patel, et al, 2004).*\n\n*At that time, it is theorized that a poison\\* is secreted from the tines. Whoever ingests what the fork touches will become fatally ill. They will experience fever, sweating, dizziness, and hallucinations. They will die within four to seven days, with the average being five-point-seven.*\n\n*Not much is known about the person’s experience after they ingest the poison, as they are usually unable to speak after day two (they only scream.)*\n\n*Recovery Procedures: #824 cannot be destroyed with fire. It can withstand up to 10,000 PSI, or possibly more (O’Keefe, 1997.) There is no known cure for individuals affected. Because of this, it is recommended that #824 is kept locked in a safe at twenty-percent air humidity or lower.*\n\n*Origin: It is thought that #824 dates back to Rome in the 4th century, when they began experimenting with material properties, such as using dichromatic glass in the Lycurgus Cup. However, the entity’s exact origin is unknown.*\n\n*\\*While theorized to be a poison, the exact nature of the substance is unclear. It decomposes so quickly, thorough studies have been impossible.*\n\n“I got it from a traveling salesman,” she said. “Well, not literally. He wasn’t a *man,* of course. But the Board said no. Apparently, because it was so untraceable, it had been used in several murders already. They were glad to have it back.”\n\n“So the fork isn’t okay,” Elias said, reading over my shoulder, “but the woman in the painting, who almost killed us, is?”\n\n“It’s complicated. The painting was supposed to be picked up a few days ago. I was only keeping it for a little while.”\n\n“And you let me work here, alone, while you were in possession of it,” I said, glaring at her.\n\n“Look, I’m sorry. I’d forgotten about it. Okay? You were the one who didn’t listen to my rules. About wearing closed-toe shoes and everything,” she said back.\n\n“Fair,” I said. “Sort of. Mom’s going to be *pissed,* though.”\n\nShe paled. “You’re… you’re not going to tell your mom about this.”\n\n“I’m not?”\n\n“She’d *kill* me.”\n\n“Oh yes, she absolutely would.”\n\nShe glanced at Kira, then Elias, then back at me. Then her eyes narrowed. “You’re trying to negotiate with me. Is that it? You want something? Spit it out, then. You want money? You want me to pay you for the summer, and tell your mom you’re working when you’re out surfing or something? Fine. I’ll do it. But if you *ever* breathe a word—”\n\n“That’s not what I want.” I looked at her squarely. “I want the fork.”\n\n“Nadia, I can’t—”\n\n“Kidding. I want you to employ Kira with me. Her job sucks. Her coworker harasses her. Her boss makes her come in on weekends.” I glanced down at her. “No offense.”\n\nShe put up her hands, as if to say, *nope, it’s fine.*\n\nAunt Gigi’s eyes narrowed, glancing from me to Kira.\n\n“I don’t know,” she said. “What if something in here injures or kills her? I’m going to be sued to all hell.”\n\nMy jaw fell open. “*That’s* what you’re worried about?”\n\n“Well, obviously I don’t want her to die, either. I’m just saying…”\n\n“I’ll sign a waiver,” Kira cut in. “I’ll do whatever. You just have to educate us properly on the dangers. Because, like, you didn’t tell Nadia what was going on at all.”\n\n“This is a big ask,” Aunt Gigi said.\n\nI pulled out my phone and started dialing.\n\n“No—okay, okay! She can work here. It’s not my fault if she dies, though. The waiver’s going to say that.”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe first few days of the job went smoothly. Aunt Gigi gave us everything to read. The manual, the safety protocols, *everything.* “I didn’t think there would be homework,” Kira groaned, as we poured over the manual on our break.\n\n“It’s better than working with Chad, though, isn’t it?”\n\nShe sighed. “Yeah.”\n\nAn hour after our break, on that third day, we had our first customer. Most of our work up until then had been reading, restocking, and sweeping the floor—we hadn’t dealt with customers yet. Aunt Gigi always dealt with them if she was here, but today she wasn’t, off to pick up some haunted table china in Rockville.\n\nThe bell jingled. Kira and I looked at each other, excited, and then made our way to the front of the store.\n\nThe safety manual had included a list of rules for how to interface with the “not-people,” as Aunt Gigi so lovingly called them. I felt like they would be supremely offended if they knew we called them not-people, but she said there wasn’t a better word. “They’re other beings wearing peoples’ skin,” she’d said, “so I suppose you could call them that. Skin-wearers, maybe?”\n\n“No,” Kira and I said at the same time.\n\nThe rules were simple. Don’t make eye contact with them. Don’t speak to them more than necessary. And don’t *ever* ask them why they need to purchase what they’re purchasing.\n\nThis not-person took on the appearance of an older gentleman. He had fluffy white hair and bent dramatically over his cane. He wobbled into the store, slowly scanning our wares, his thick mustache trembling with each breath. Aunt Gigi warned us that sometimes the not-people looked *off—*uncanny—like an early ‘00s render or a drawing of a person by someone who’d never actually seen a person. This man was no exception.\n\nI didn’t make eye contact with him, but I could tell his eyes were too close together. His face was too, trapezoidal almost, with the cheekbones sticking out so far. And his arms weren’t even the same length.\n\n“Excuse me, miss,” he said in a warbly voice as he approached the counter, “could you direct me to the fedora, please? Number two-one-two.”\n\nWow, this guy (not-guy) didn’t screw around. He gave the number and all.\n\n“Not a problem,” I said, riffling through the manual.\n\n*Entity #212*\n\n*Class III*\n\n*Presentation: Entity #212 is a fedora-style hat in a men’s size 7. There is a small tear on the rim, but it is otherwise in good condition. When worn, it allows Subentity #212-A, colloquially known as “The Demon,” to take control of the wearer’s body. “The Demon” is a bit of a misnomer, as the behavior of #212-A is more poltergeist-like than demon-like, and there is no proof that it is associated with demons from Christian theology.\\**\n\n*Safety Precautions: #212 only activates if it is placed on the head a living creature (human or animal.) It will not be activated if it is touched by hands or other body parts.*\n\n*Recovery Procedures: Removing the hat will immediately stop all effects.*\n\n*Origin: Unknown, though the lack of stitchwork indicates this is not an ordinary object that was given these qualities, but a created as a whole through supernatural means.*\n\n*\\*More conventionally “demonic” behavior of #212-A has been reported from unverified sources. The Lin Scale classifies #212 as Class IV because of these accounts.*\n\n“Right this way,” I told the man, leading him towards the back, where we kept our clothing items. There was a rack of a few dresses and a coat rack that held exactly one child’s coat and one fedora-style hat.\n\nI carefully took it off the rack, keeping it far away from my head, and gave it to the man. “Here you go! Payment up front.”\n\nI stared walking back towards the counter.\n\nI was halfway there when I felt pressure on the crown of my head.\n\n*What the—*\n\nMy entire body froze. I tried to take a step, but couldn’t. My heart began to pound.\n\nHe put the hat on me.\n\nI tried to lift my arms to take it off. Nope.\n\n*KIRA!,* I screamed internally. *Where the fuck are you?*\n\nMy body started to rotate. I turned towards the man, and felt my lips turn up in a smile. “So we meet again,” I heard my voice say. Except it sounded so unlike me, filled with hate and venom, coming from low in my throat.\n\nI stepped towards the man. He flinched. “Have you thought about the deal?” I rasped.\n\nHe nodded.\n\n*No, stop, stop it!*\n\n“I want to proceed,” he said, finally.\n\n“You remember our terms?”\n\nHe nodded.\n\n“You will provide me a permanent host, and I will restore your youth?”\n\nHe nodded again.\n\n*Permanent host?*\n\n“Is this host sufficient?” he asked. “It is youthful, and female, like you.”\n\nA pause.\n\n“It is sufficient.”\n\n*NO!* I screamed internally. *GET OUT OF MY HEAD!* But no matter how hard I tried to wrench my arms to my head, I couldn’t lift a single finger. My heart pounded in my chest. *FUCK FUCK FUCK. GET OUT! GET OUT!*\n\nKira would find me. She would take the hat off. And then it would all end. Right?\n\n“There is just one modification I would like to make,” I heard my voice say. Then I wheeled around the room. I picked up an old silver knife, held it up to the light.\n\nThen I brought it closer to my face.\n\n“I had blue eyes in my corporeal form. Not brown,” the voice said.\n\n*Oh no oh no oh no—*\n\nThe pressure disappeared. Kira was standing in front of me, holding the hat. “What the *fuck* are you doing?!” she screeched. “You’re not supposed to put this on!”\n\n“He, he put it on me—”\n\nI whipped around just in time to see the man escaping out the front door.\n\n“Oh no,” Kira said, pointing to my eye.\n\n*Oh no.* I touched the skin under my eye. My fingers came away red.\n\n“Is it bad?” I whispered.\n\n“’Tis but a scratch,” Kira replied.\n\nAnd that’s how Kira and I learned that not every customer of Gigi’s is nice. In fact, sometimes the not-people are more dangerous than the entities themselves."},"69":{"title":"My brother's voice started coming through the baby monitor [Final]","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k8vsun\/my_brothers_voice_started_coming_through_the_baby\/","flair":"Series","author":"ExceptingAlice","selftext":"\n[Part 1](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/s\/C5F7BWngIE) [Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/s\/OwU35BiNUP)\n [Part 3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/s\/S9hck7EROE) [Part 4](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/s\/RVLlGYT0Nn) [Part 5](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/s\/YQUMRTN3Ep)\n\nCaleb didn’t move at first.\n\nThe spirit’s voice threaded through the smoke, soft and slithering:\n\"You don't have to die.

She was just doing her job, and I clearly wasn't competent enough at mine. When I wasn't cleaning hotel rooms during the day, I was putting up with drunk losers who make triple my salary demanding more shots from the other side of the bar. If you cant tell, that doesn't leave too much room for me to sleep, and the comfortable hotel bedrooms that I definitely couldn't afford to be in during normal circumstances, were just too alluring for me to resist sometimes. \n\n\n\nI drove home early that day in my 2007 Toyota Camry, it wasn't exactly a Ferrari, but it got me from point A to point B, and that's all I really need. Well, needed, I doubt I'll be driving to the hotel anymore after I decided that 2pm was naptime. The drive home was like every other, just a few hours earlier than I anticipated. A thick fog coated the area, reminding me of Silent Hill, a reference which makes me feel old for even thinking of.\n\nI sat in the car, blasting music with my windows down, tapping the steering wheel to the beat.\n\n\n\nIt was only once the song finished, that I realised just how quiet it was. I don't just mean the roads, I mean everything. No singing mockingbirds, no cyclists, hell, not even any insects blindly smashing into my already filthy windshield. It almost felt like a blessing at first, I slowed down the car, just wanting to enjoy the brief calmness before the storm that I knew was waiting for me back at my place.\n\n\n\nI pulled over on a dilapidated country road on the route home, getting out of the car .It was my final drive home from the hotel, I might as well take my time and enjoy my victory lap, I thought to myself. I pulled out a creased pack of cigarettes from my coat pocket. I hardly considered myself a smoker, but one every now and again they helped take the edge off. \n\nI stared out into the distant fog. It relaxed me at first, but after a while, something changed. It started to hurt, like I was looking at something my brain was struggling to understand. I just wanted to toss it up to the damp, discoloured, cigarette, but something just didn't feel quite right. It was time for me to get back on the road, I didn't know much, but that, that I did know\n\n\n\nA quarter of an hour later, I pulled in to my driveway. Good god, I needed to mow the lawn at some point, it was getting close to being legally considered a jungle. As I walked down towards my house, my eyes peered to my right. My neighbour was fast asleep on his porch chair, but I had no idea how he wasn't awoken by my loud-ass car pulling into the driveway. Not that I was complaining, there's only so many of his 'back in my day' rants I can handle before I start feel sleepy myself. After a turn of the key and a few shoulder barges, my door squeaked open. I really needed to get the hinges fixed, turns out, WD40 doesn't actually fix everything. I headed to the fridge, hoping for a quick snack. Upon opening, I saw what I thought was  some sort of red smoothie. I sure as hell didn't make it, so I assumed my sister made it before heading to school. She was more into the healthy stuff than I was. I had a sip. It tasted absolutely foul, almost metallic. It probably had some sort of health benefit, but I didn't want any part of it, so I put it back where I found it.\n\n\n\nI browsed LinkedIn for about an hour after that, searching for a day job that paid anything above minimum wage. Just when I thought I was finally getting somewhere, the universe gave me a giant middle finger. My internet connection was gone. At this point, I could only laugh at my own misfortune. I lived deep in rural Nevada, and whilst we aren't still living like we are in the wild west, id be lying if I said that the internet connection was perfect, so I wasn't exactly surprised. I took it as a sign and decided to call it a night on the job search. I checked the time, 7:30. Better make some dinner, I thought.\n\n\n\nI was no chef, but I could make a mean plain boiled pasta, or so I've heard. I filled a pot with a healthy serving of fusilli, as I planned on saving some for my lunch tomorrow. I carried the pot to the other end of my cramped kitchen, gently placing it down in the sink prior to turning the tap on to fill it with water.\n\n\n\nThat's when I noticed something odd.\n\n\n\nThe water, if you could even call it that, had a reddish-brown tint to it. At the time, I was more annoyed than concerned. Not only did I not have any drinking water, but it had also ruined some perfectly good pasta. I'd just call the water company in the morning, I thought. There had probably just been a leak in the pipes, or something. I'm not gonna pretend that I know anything about water or pipes. \n\n\n\nI carried the tainted pot into my front yard to scrape it into my already overflowing trash can, successfully managing to prevent any spillage; it was the little victories that counted. Just as I turned around to head back into my house, I noticed that my neighbours porch light was still on. Mr Pinney probably just forgot to turn it off when he went back inside, I assumed. As I got closer to his house, the situation just got increasingly weirder.\n\n\n\nMr Pinney was still sat on his porch chair, seemingly still fast asleep.\n\n\n\nConcerned, I hurriedly made my way towards my elderly neighbour, which is when I noticed just how deathly pale he was. He was never exactly tanned, but this just looked wrong, even just the sight of him made me feel queasy. I tried shouting his name, to no avail. Starting to feel a little unsettled, I shook him by his shoulders, causing his head to jolt back.\n\n\n\nI fell backwards after seeing his neck, I barely had enough strength to catch myself on the porch railing. He had a giant gash on his neck, deep enough to expose his windpipe. I stood there, urgently trying to catch my breath. Once I eventually recovered from the initial shock, the confusion set in.\n\n\n\nWhere the hell was all the blood?\n\n\n\nThis was a deep, wide cut, but not a single drop of blood could be seen on, or even around his body. Aside from the beer stains, his white shirt was spotless. It was like he was some sort of wax figure. Every litre, every gallon, was gone. \n\n\n\nHis dog sat cold and lifeless on his lap. I didn't know if it had the same fate as its owner, but I didn't have the heart or the balls to check.\n\nBefore I could even start to think about who did this, or how they did this, the porch light flickered, and then cut out, shrouding me and the pale, shrivelled husk that once was Mr Pinney in complete darkness. Not even the moon shone, not even it wanted to illuminate this horrific scene.\n\n\n\nIll be honest, I screamed like a little girl. I got up, making a break for the fence separating our properties, I refused to step into the fog on the street, knowing what could still be out there. Using one arm to propel myself, I just about conjured up enough strength to leap over the picket fence, with agility that in any other circumstance, id be pretty damn impressed with.\n\n\n\nI made it to my door, which I had idiotically not thought to lock when I left, and repeatedly thrusted into it, scolding myself for being too stingy to not get it fixed sooner. I pushed it open just wide enough for me to slide in sideways, and I wasted no time entering. Thankfully, it shut easier than it opened. I immediately looked for my phone, and dialled 911, having to take my time to enter the numbers because of my shaking fingers.\n\n\n\nMy heart dropped further than I already thought it could when my phone flashed up with an error message. No explanation given, just 'ERROR'.\n\nThe coincidences were just piling up, I fell backwards into my couch. I tried calling my sister, hell, I tried everyone. Every time, I just got the same damn error message.\n\n\n\nI knew I couldn't stay here. Whoever, or whatever, did this to my neighbour, probably knew I was here. I needed to go. I grabbed my car keys, and headed for the front door. Then I remembered, when I moved out, my father gifted me a gun. It was nothing fancy, just a colt 1911, but it was better than nothing. I grabbed it from the drawer in my bedside table. I'd never really used it before, and I was starting to regret not taking my dad's offer up for some training all those years ago.\n\n\n\nI crept downstairs, not wanting to make too much noise. Luckily, the door opened pretty easily this time, allowing me to sneak over to the car. I didn't even bother shutting the door, there was nothing in there of value anyway. I got in the car, turning the key. Something was wrong.\n\n\n\nI had no gas.\n\n\n\nI didn't understand, I had a full tank this morning, and I had only driven sixty miles to the hotel and back. The car wouldn't even start. Its not like I was running on fumes, it was like all the gasoline had just vanished, just like Mr Pinney's blood did, as much as I wanted it to be a coincidence, but the evidence was just piling up.\n\n\n\nThat's when it clicked.\n\n\n\nI didn't just stumble into a crime scene. Whatever did this, it wasn't gone. It was still here. It was messing with me, like some sick little game.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been locked in my car for the past 2 hours, writing this, hoping somebody will find it. To whoever is reading this, I have one piece of advice.\n\n\n\nDon't stare into the fog, you don't know what is staring back.\n\n\n\n"},"71":{"title":"And when the lights came back on, there was a number on everybody’s arm.

Blair looked at her, then at me. \n\n“*Wow, that’s a nice gun*,” she said. And immediately she started clawing for it with no real regard for her own safety. I put up a fight before remembering that my ‘paper tiger’ version of a pistol probably wasn’t worth dying for. She tore it from my hands, laughing as red droplets flicked from her mouth. \n\nThen she just held it and looked at us. And I knew the second the *click* came through, we’d have to run, *not* crawl.\n\nBut instead, after giving us a look of contemplation, she just backed away, continuing to giggle. “Hey, *hey all of you fuckheads,*” she shouted, garnering attention, desperately looking behind her to make sure no one was closing in. “Fuck *all of your dumb alliances*.” And I watched the bottom half of her step out of frame and closer to the center of the chaos. “*Matt*,” *she said.* “Remember when you forgot to cc me on the Tradewinds report and made me look like a fucking moron for not knowing about it? Maybe I should blow your brains out for that, hey?” And then her body pivoted. “Or *Terry.* Where the fuck’s Terry? I heard what you said about me—that I *derail meetings?* Fuck you I do! My shit *ends on time.*”\n\nBlair and I went for it—a mad dash this time.\n\n“Go, go,” I said, as we sprinted around tables, bodies, and violent strangers to close the last few meters between us and the hallway. I heard multiple “Hey’s!” coming from distant corners and from folks crawling out from cover. I prayed Blair still had her half of a scissor blade if needed, but as we stepped out of the open office, it was clear that the department fights, megaphones, and now—Lindsey’s hollow gun—served as enough of a powder keg to make our small fireworks presentation seem lame in comparison. \n\nI turned to look—no one was after us.\n\nWe bolted down the hallway. The distant door to the stairwell was wide open.\n\n“Please, please for the *love of God,*” Blair said as we made it and stepped through the propped-open passage and descended into the stairwell. I looked up. I looked down. No life—only the remnants of blood and chaos. *Empty.* We thundered down the taps. \n\n“What happens if the tallies aren’t gone when we step outside?” she asked me.\n\n“Then we’ll figure something out, because at that point there’d be no other choice, but *right now*, much as I hate the word, let’s hope. Let’s *fucking hope.*” \n\nOur boots slammed the last few steps before we hit the second floor. I awaited jumpscares but was met with nothing. We continued on desperately towards ground level. \n\n“I just want a shower, and fucking ice cream, and—oh—yeah, I’m gonna *finally* see my therapist,” Blair said, and I almost laughed.\n\nAnd then we reached the bottom. The back exit to the outside world. I held the handle. I turned and pushed.\n\n*Nothing.* Locked.\n\n“No. No, *fucking please—-*” I started, frantically trying to twist the handle.\n\n“It’s locked,” I heard a voice say. We both turned—-a man with a stab wound in his stomach **crawled** from his hiding space underneath the stairs. “I already tried it.”\n\nI took the lead as we moved towards him cautiously. He held a light smile on his face. “It’s funny. It feels like *mortally injured people* are probably the new currency in our fucked up workplace economy.”\n\n“We’re not gonna hurt you,” Blair said. He reacted with a face I couldn’t place. “It’s been—*this has been enough as is*. We just wanted to see if there was a way we could get out.”\n\nHe shifted a bit. Looked like he was deep in thought. Then, “you guys got two left each on your tallies. And still a bit of time I’d imagine. I’ll let one of you kill me, but on one condition.”\n\nBlair and I immediately turned to each other. “We’re not gonna—” I started.\n\n“Shh,” he said. “I left my phone upstairs. I dropped it. I just want to… call my son. Tell him I love him.”\n\n“We just came from the third floor,” I said. “*It’s gonna be a shitshow.*”\n\n“What’s his number? I can call him,” from Blair.\n\n“I don’t… I can’t remember his number.”\n\nBlair pulled me aside, whispered. “*What the fuck do we do? Just leave him?*”\n\nIt was no ‘trolley problem’, but it still the strangest moral quandary I’d ever been faced with. Was this… *ethical murder,* if we fulfilled his last wishes first?\n\n“But maybe it’s a good thing,” Blair continued, low. “I don’t think we have enough time to… y’know… *beat this whole tally thing*.” She looked down at her marking. “The megaphone psycho dude asked—*what kind of people do we want to die as,* right? Or something like that?” \n\nAnd it was partially the mania and the adrenaline, but I was endeared to the idea.\n\n“I’ll sign my life to you both,” he said, “if you do this favor—”\n\n“It’s on the house,” I said. And strange as it was, we hoisted the stranger between us—and started the slow ascent. *Step after step.* It had been a weird life.\n\n“Never thought two girls from marketing would ever give me the time of day,” he said. It was a weird note—I guess he knew us, despite him being a complete stranger to me at least. I looked at his arm. \n\n*Step. Step.*\n\n# I\n\nHe didn’t *seem* like a fighter, so maybe the guy must’ve had the best and worst simultaneous luck in this whole game. Born on fourth base with the ‘I,’ *shanked* immediately.\n\n*More steps.* We’d arrived back at the second floor, en route to the third. The word ‘seem’ lingered in my mind—after today’s learnings, did anyone actually *act* how they *seemed?*\n\n“Where did you leave your phone?” Blair asked.\n\nHe groaned in pain as we continued the grinding climb. “It… must’ve been in the bathroom,” he said. “On the third floor. So… we’re almost there.” \n\nAnd our footfalls echoed on, but I could feel something tense in Blair, much as it did it in me. And I snuck a hand, ever so carefully, on *instinct* rather than intention, into his jeans pocket, tracing what I’d first thought was the sound of pocket change clinking. I carefully pulled out what was, without a shadow of a doubt, a *shell casing.* A bullet. \n\n*Step. Step.*\n\n“Was it gonna be today?” I asked him, brazen. I noticed Blair quietly reach for something.\n\n“Today that wha—”\n\n“Blair, do it!” I screamed, but before she could strike with her scissors, he *kicked* her leg back and she fell, toppling down four or five stairs, slamming her head *hard* against one of them, the office weapon tumbling down further.\n\n“No!” I screamed, and immediately he went for me next, overpowering me with a quick, desperate burst of strength and flipping me onto my back. Before he could catch me with a swing, *I stuck my fingers deep into his wound.* He screamed in response. I placed my free hand on his neck and with whatever strength I had left tried to choke him.\n\n“It’s funny… you’re seeing me as the bad guy now,” he said, struggling, between pained gasps, “*when everyone with a fucking pulse is tearing each other apart today—*”\n\n“*Being miserable doesn’t give you the right to make it the world’s problem.* Don’t compare everyone’s shittiness in the face of something *incomprehensible* to you being willing to kill people on a *sunny fucking day—*”\n\nHe rocked me with a punch, my head bouncing against the step. I involuntarily detached, almost forgetting where I was. And then the words just came out of me. “You’re gonna—fucking—die here,” I said.\n\n“*So are you,*” and his smarmy tone suddenly gave me a second wind and this time I secured both of my hands around his neck. It didn’t stop him. He swung again, and again, but I held on, trying to squeeze air out of his windpipe. \n\nI heard the rush of footsteps coming up the stairs. Blair, having come to, swung at the back of his head a few times. It didn’t stop him. In a frantic blitz, she reached to dig her nails into his face—his eyes. He groaned. “Help me… choke him…” I said. She tried to join me in grabbing his neck, but he shifted to the side, catching both of us with flailing jabs and elbows. \n\nShe switched strategy, desperately jamming her hand into his mouth, pinching his nose closed with her other, while I continued to try to force the oxygen out of him. “Just fucking die!” she screamed. He thrashed violently, bit down—Blair screamed—but she held on and the messiness of a *long, weak* strangulation played out in front of us. No instruments to help the murder, just brute force with what we’d been born with, and soon—his eyes fixed and the fight drained out of him. \n\nAnd then, he really *was* dead. We both let go and lifted ourselves up evenly on the stairs. I looked at the torn-up, destroyed mess of Blair’s hand. And her tally. And my tally. They were both the same.\n\n# I\n\n“Hey,” I said, “I guess whatever this is, it *counts* teamwork. That’s a silver lining I gu—”\n\n“*I can’t fucking do this anymore!*” she screamed. \n\n“Fair, totally *fair—”* and then immediately my head shot up as I heard people rushing down the stairs from above. “We need to fucking *go*,” I said, accidentally grabbing her busted-up hand by mistake, causing her to wince, and then gripping her arm instead. We stormed back down the steps and pushed through the door to the second floor. We charged past occupied rooms, barricaded hallways, and bodies galore as I tried to spot somewhere—anywhere—we could catch respite. The small kitchen in the corner that showed up in my line of sight seemed like the best bet.\n\nWe hurried to it as an injured, feral-seeming survivor heard us from a distance and gave chase. We slipped in, I smashed the door behind us, then locked it. The stranger banged at the door for a beat before giving up.\n\nBlair looked around for a second, then sat back against the refrigerator and slowly slid herself to the ground. A long exhale. “*How much time do we have left?*” she asked. \n\nI walked up to the microwave on the counter. *5:13 PM.* Three minutes until we’d supposedly die.\n\nBeside the microwave: a knife block that had been nearly completely raided. There was a single blade left lodged in one of the wooden slots.\n\nBoth Blair and I were down to one tally. There was no time left.\n\nI grabbed the knife.   \n\nI walked back over to her. Crouched down to her level. It took her a second to look at me. Confusion in her expression once she realized what I was holding. \n\nSlowly, I placed the handle of the blade into her mangled hand.\n\nI sat down beside her. I closed my eyes.\n\nAfter a few seconds—“what are you doing?” she asked.\n\n“Time’s almost up. You have one left on your tally. Let’s not waste the horror.”\n\n“*So do you.*” Then—“I’m not going to kill you.”\n\n“You *actually* have something to live for. You have *friends* and a *life* and a *boyfriend who loves you* and you seem to, give a shit to like—*actually* live your—”\n\n“*So do you!*”\n\n“I am an empty person. I feel, like, *nothing,* most of the time. Otherwise, it’s like, *slight comfort* or anxiety or stress, I am—*I, this”* I motioned to myself, “Doesn’t need to continue.” I thought back to the one unnecessary kill I made. “But maybe it can end on like, an *okay* note. Maybe *I* can end… on an okay note.”\n\n“You are *fucked,*” she said.\n\nI laughed. “No kidding.” Then—“I hope it’s like, easy. The way we die. Like, *not brutal,* just like… the way the Avengers go out, y’know? Like, I start fading away and turning into leaves or whatever, and it’s like—and then I go like—Mr. Stark, I don’t feel so good.” I started snickering. She looked at me like I was fucking gone. “*I’m melting, Mr. Stark,*” I snickered again.\n\n“How the fuck were *you* playing the straight man in our friendship?”\n\n“Mr. Stark, stick a fork in me—I’m cooked.”\n\n“Do you really want those to be your last words?” she said.\n\n“*Come on*,” I said. “Live a little.”\n\nShe smiled. Shook her head. “Fine,” she said, caving. “Mr. Stark… I dunno, clear my search history for me or something. *Please.*”\n\nI laughed. “Je m’appelle Stark, je suis triste.”\n\n“That means, *I am Stark, I am sad.*”\n\n“He *is* sad,” I said. “*Spiderman* just died!” \n\nAnd then, from that same PA that came the initial mandate, came a new beeping sound. A countdown, it seemed. For how long it would run for, who knew.\n\nShe rested her head on my shoulder.\n\n“We did alright, right?” she asked.\n\n“Yeah, we *tried.*” Then—”You said *our friendship* earlier?”\n\n“Easy *cancer,* let’s not end this on too saccharine a note.”\n\n“*Hey,*” I said. “*Big word, look at you.*”\n\n“Fuck you,” she laughed.\n\n“Fuck you too,” I said, and I closed my eyes, and the *beep beep beep* intensified until—\n\nIt stopped.\n\nSilence. Deafening silence.\n\nAnd that tinny voice returned to the PA system.\n\n**“Thanks. That was great. The test is now complete. You’re free to go.”** \n\nAs I sat with the revelation, a follow-up came a split-second afterwards: **“P.S. If you want great seats for the next phase, feel free to go to the roof.”**\n\nIt took us a good while—minutes that felt like hours—to finally slide up from our seats. I was afraid that instant death in the form of an invisible shock collar or something would knock me out, but… nothing.\n\nBlair used her miserable hand to return the knife into the knife block. I unlocked the door.\n\nWe limped to the elevators. Called them.\n\n*DING.*\n\nThey opened near-immediately. A few dead bodies lined the back. We got in.\n\nI looked at the “ground floor” button and the tenth floor button. She pressed the tenth floor. I looked at her.\n\n“Five minutes ago I thought we were absolutely dead. Fuck it,” she said. The doors closed. The elevator went up.\n\n*DING.* Third floor. Lindsey—project manager, frequent all-hands presenter and gun thief entered. She limped in. Took a spot near the back.\n\n“Sorry,” she said.\n\n“All good,” I said. \n\n“That gun didn’t have any—”\n\n“Bullets,” I said. \n\n“Yes,” she said. “Wait. You knew?”\n\n“Yes,” I said.\n\n“Makes sense.”\n\nThe doors started closing—until a hand slipped in, stopping them.\n\nThey slid open again. Chris, the man with the megaphone entered. “*Ladies*,” he said. They closed again. “We all going up?”\n\n“Yes,” both Blair and I said in unison, to Lindsey’s shock.\n\n“Wait,” she said. “This is going up?”\n\n—\n\nIt didn’t take too long to figure out what the man on the PA had meant.\n\nI looked out from the rooftop to the neighboring buildings. For many blocks out, it looked like the lights had been killed dead—pitch black. We kept eyeing until they suddenly came back. With the returned illumination, I spotted something else through all the windows. The people inside were thrown, confused, wondering what’d happened, and then suddenly—in a stark throwback to only an hour ago—looking down at their arms with concern. I could feel the panic from my *distant enough* vantage point.\n\nAnd I wondered what my—*our*—civic duty was at this moment. Chris, in an extension of his previous attempts to quell group mania, turned on the megaphone again and leaned over the ledge to try—likely to no avail—to get the folks to not panic. “*People!”* he started. *“You don’t need to fulfill the tallies—*”\n\n“Kay,” said Blair off the distorted backdrop, “I already know your birthday and where you were born. But do you know what *time* you were born? Like, exactly.” \n\nI thought for a second. “Why?”\n\n“Just answer the question. I’m doing your star chart.”\n\n“Hmm.” Funny enough, it was a piece of personal trivia I actually had the answer to. “Time of birth for me was… 2:02 AM. Ish.”\n\nAnd then she clicked away at her phone, really taking her time with it, wincing with every button press that required the input of an injured digit. And then—\n\n“Oh shit,” she said, fixated on the result, while I watched, like clockwork, the neighbouring buildings fall to greater confusion, greater hiding, escalating violence, and people defaulting to their spots on the ever-so-violent fight, flight, and freeze continuum. “*Capricorn moon*.” She looked at me, *really* looked at me. “I mean, I fucking love that [for you.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/WorldAwayTweedy\/comments\/16r75hk\/master_story_list_and_narration_policy\/)” "},"72":{"title":"I Hear My Mom Calling Me From the Basement","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k8medw\/i_hear_my_mom_calling_me_from_the_basement\/","flair":null,"author":"Popular-Ruin521","selftext":"I’m not sure why I’m even writing this down.\nMaybe because if something happens to me, at least someone will know the truth.\n\nMy mom died two months ago.\nCar accident.\nShe was coming home late from work when a drunk driver ran a red light.\n\nIt was sudden. Brutal.\nNo last words. No goodbyes.\n\nI live alone now in the house we shared.\nIt’s too big for one person, but I can’t bring myself to leave yet.\nHer stuff is still everywhere. Her shoes by the door. Her coffee mug in the sink. Her favorite blanket tossed over the couch.\nLike she’s just out running errands, and any second now, she’ll walk through the door.\n\nThe first time I heard her, I thought I was dreaming.\n\nIt was around 3:30 a.m.\nI woke up to the sound of her voice — faint, but unmistakable.\n\n“Sweetheart? Can you come here?”\n\nI sat up, heart racing.\nIt came from the basement.\n\nI told myself it was just a dream.\nMaybe I was half-asleep and imagined it.\n\nThe next night, it happened again.\nSame time.

Same call.\n\nAnd little by little, it changed.\n\nAt first, she sounded normal.\nThen, the tone shifted — slower, heavier.\nLike the voice was dragging itself through the words.\n\nThree nights ago, when I didn’t respond, I heard footsteps coming up the basement stairs.\nSoft, deliberate.\nThey stopped at the basement door.\n\nAnd then… a knock.\n\nThree slow, heavy knocks.\n\nI didn’t move.

It hides when you look, follows when you turn your back. People used to say it snatched loggers, hikers, hunters. Always from behind. Always without a sound.\n\nIt was just a campfire story to me.\n\nUntil two weeks ago.\n\nI was clearing some old trails behind my grandfather’s property in northern Maine. He died last fall, left the land to me—a patch of dense, silent forest nobody in the family really wanted. I figured I could clean it up, maybe sell it to some “off-grid” survival type.\n\nThe woods felt wrong almost immediately.\n\nIt wasn’t just the quiet. It was a layered silence, like every sound was being swallowed before it could reach me. The crack of a branch under my boot barely echoed. Even the wind felt muted, like it was holding its breath.\n\nAbout an hour in, I started noticing little things.\n\nTools I knew I put down would vanish if I turned away for even a second.\n\nThe little trail markers I tied to the trees with bright orange tape kept disappearing behind me.\n\nAnd sometimes—only when I wasn’t looking directly—I’d feel something slip from tree to tree.\n\nFast. Silent. Always in my peripheral vision.\n\nI thought I was just being paranoid.\n\nThen I found the shack.\n\nIt wasn’t on any map. Just a small structure of rotting wood tucked into a grove of black pines. No windows. No chimney. The door barely hanging on its hinges.\n\nI should’ve turned back.\n\nBut the hairs on the back of my neck stood up—and not from fear.\n\nIt felt… like a dare.\n\nLike something wanted me to come closer.\n\nInside was a single room. Dirt floor. Collapsed roof.\n\nAnd a pile of bones in the center.\n\nSome human, some not.\n\nAll broken and twisted like they’d been bent backward before death.\n\nThere were carvings on the walls. Hundreds of them. Rough shapes gouged deep into the wood with something sharp.\n\nNot words.\n\nNot pictures.\n\nJust… eye shapes. Staring. Crowded together until the walls looked like skin covered in bulging tumors.\n\nThat’s when I heard it.\n\nThe breathing.\n\nShallow, ragged, right behind me.\n\nI didn’t turn around.\n\nI couldn’t.\n\nSomething in my gut screamed that if I turned around—if I acknowledged it—it would be real.\n\nSo I stepped backward.\n\nSlowly.\n\nOne foot. Then the other.\n\nOut the door, into the clearing.\n\nThe breathing followed. Closer.\n\nI could feel a long, cold exhale brushing the back of my neck.\n\nI ran.\n\nBranches clawed at my clothes, the underbrush grabbed at my boots, but I didn’t stop until I saw the rusted frame of my truck between the trees.\n\nThe breathing never stopped.\n\nI slammed the door, locked it, and peeled out onto the rutted trail.\n\nDidn’t look back once.\n\nBut here’s the thing:\n\nI know it followed me home.\n\nAt first it was just little things again.\n\nFootsteps in the hallway at night when I was alone.\n\nCabinet doors left open after I swore I closed them.\n\nReflections in the TV screen when it was off—shapes moving in the background.\n\nLast night, though, I saw it.\n\nNot fully.\n\nNot straight on.\n\nI was brushing my teeth, leaned down to spit in the sink, and when I looked up—\n\nthere was something crouched just behind my left shoulder.\n\nLong, jointed limbs.\n\nNo face—just skin pulled tight over where a face should’ve been.\n\nAnd the worst part?\n\nIt wasn’t hiding.\n\nIt was waiting.\n\nI didn’t sleep after that.\n\nI sat up in bed, every light in the house on, trying to convince myself it was a trick of the mirror, a hallucination, anything but what I knew it was.\n\nBut sometime around 3:00 AM, I started noticing… distortions.\n\nFirst, it was the walls.\n\nThey seemed too far away.\n\nLike the room was stretching when I wasn’t looking, the corners retreating into shadows that shouldn’t exist.\n\nThen the sounds started.\n\nI’d hear the front door creak open, the soft pad of footsteps on the hardwood.\n\nI’d rush to check—nothing.\n\nI’d swear I heard the shower turn on by itself.\n\nI’d fling the curtain back—dry.\n\nAt some point, I stopped trusting my own eyes.\n\nSometimes I’d catch a glimpse of my own reflection in a window—and it wouldn’t move in sync with me. It would lag behind by a second, like it was deciding whether to follow.\n\nOther times, I’d catch a glimpse of something crouched inside the walls, pressing against the drywall like it was made of wet paper, skin stretching taut, fingers too long and too many joints bending the wrong way.\n\nAlways just for a blink.\n\nAlways gone when I turned my full attention to it.\n\nThe worst part was the sound, though.\n\nThat breathing.\n\nIt was getting bolder.\n\nNot just behind me anymore.\n\nAbove me. Below. Inside the vents, the closet, the crawl space under the house.\n\nA low, wet rasp.\n\nLike something trying to learn how to breathe human air.\n\nBy the fifth day, reality just… stopped making sense.\n\nI’d walk into the kitchen to find all the drawers pulled out, contents dumped on the floor—only to blink and see everything back in place.\n\nI’d reach for my phone and feel the cold, clammy touch of something else wrap around my fingers before vanishing.\n\nVoices whispered my name from inside the walls, getting the pronunciation wrong. Twisting it like it was tasting the sound.\n\nAnd still, the breathing.\n\nAlways the breathing.\n\nI stopped leaving the house.\n\nI stopped answering texts, calls, emails.\n\nPeople think I’m sick. Depressed. Crazy.\n\nMaybe I am.\n\nBut I know the truth.\n\nThe Hidebehind isn’t just a creature.\n\nIt’s a parasite.\n\nIt doesn’t just hide—it hollows you out from the inside.\n\nBends your senses. Warps your reality.\n\nUntil you’re not sure what’s real anymore.\n\nUntil you’re so fractured you don’t even try to fight back.\n\nAnd then—\n\nthen it steps in.\n\nIt wears you like a puppet.\n\nYou become the next reflection lagging behind.\n\nThe next whisper in the walls.\n\nThe next breathing in the dark.\n\nI think that’s why the old stories never really explained what happens to the victims.\n\nBecause once it takes you, you’re not missing.\n\nYou’re just… something else.\n\nI knew I couldn’t survive like this.\n\nI didn’t even feel fully human anymore—more like a puppet on broken strings, twitching through a life that wasn’t mine.\n\nSo I made a plan.\n\nIf it was tied to the house—to the shack, the woods, the walls—maybe I could sever it.\n\nMaybe I could burn it out.\n\nI soaked the place in gasoline.\n\nEvery room. Every inch of sagging floorboards, rotting drywall, stained carpets.\n\nThe canister was almost empty when I paused at the front door, lighter trembling in my hand.\n\nThe breathing was so loud now.\n\nIt wasn’t even pretending anymore.\n\nIt filled the air like a second heartbeat.\n\nI flicked the lighter.\n\nThe flame danced, tiny and weak against the heavy dark pressing in.\n\nI could feel it behind me.\n\nClose enough that the air grew wet and cold against the back of my neck.\n\nBut I didn’t turn around.\n\nI just dropped the lighter.\n\nThe fire caught fast.\n\nIt raced up the walls in a living, howling bloom.\n\nSmoke filled my lungs, my eyes, but I forced myself through it, stumbling outside into the cold night.\n\nI didn’t look back until I was halfway down the overgrown drive.\n\nThe house was an inferno.\n\nRoof collapsing inward, windows bursting one by one.\n\nThe trees around it caught too, sparks spiraling up into the black sky.\n\nFor a moment—just a moment—I thought I saw something in the flames.\n\nNot one thing.\n\nMany.\n\nShapes squirming just beneath the surface of the fire, writhing against each other like worms in a corpse.\n\nSome tall, some bent, some crawling.\n\nAll of them wrong.\n\nAnd all of them watching me.\n\nI didn’t stop running until I hit asphalt.\n\nI spent the night in my truck, parked at the edge of town under a streetlight that buzzed and flickered like it was struggling to stay alive.\n\nAnd for a while, I thought maybe it worked.\n\nMaybe I burned it out.\n\nMaybe I was free.\n\nBut now—now I’m not so sure.\n\nWhen I close my eyes, I can still hear it.\n\nThe breathing.\n\nNot behind me anymore.\n\nAll around.\n\nThe light in my truck flickers more than it stays steady.\n\nSometimes, in the brief moments of darkness between blinks, I catch glimpses.\n\nSomething hunched just outside the window.\n\nOr pressed against the glass.\n\nOr crouched on the ceiling above me.\n\nAlways gone when the light comes back.\n\nAlways a little closer.\n\nI think burning the house didn’t destroy it.\n\nI think it set it free.\n\nAnd it’s not just me anymore.\n\nIf you’re reading this—\n\nif you feel the hairs on your arms stand up—\n\nif you hear breathing where there shouldn’t be any—\n\nif you think, for even a second, that something just moved in the corner of your eye—\n\nDon’t turn around.\n\nDon’t look.\n\nIt’s already there.\n\n"},"74":{"title":"The Library Where You’re the Story","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k8rez0\/the_library_where_youre_the_story\/","flair":null,"author":"TheAuthor_Lily_Black","selftext":"There’s a building in my hometown that no one talks about anymore. I think people used to, back when there were still yellowed pamphlets taped to telephone poles about “community restoration” or whatever the hell that meant. It was quiet for a while. Then the signs stopped showing up. People forgot. Or maybe they just didn’t want to remember.\n\nI only ended up back here because my aunt died. She lived alone on the outskirts of the neighborhood, the kind of house with a screened-in porch that smells like dust even when it’s raining. I came to pack up her stuff, maybe flip the place or rent it out, but I didn’t get that far.\n\nHer will was strange. Not dramatic, just… off. The language felt wrong. Like it had been written by someone trying to sound formal but missing the point entirely.\n\nThe last line was what stuck:\n\n*“Do not go to the library.”*\n\nThat’s it. No explanation. Just that sentence, sitting alone on the last page, typed clean and sharp, like everything else.\n\nBut here’s the thing. We don’t have a library.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nThe building’s still there, tucked behind the old city records office, across from what used to be a dentist’s office with windows permanently fogged over from years of neglect. But nobody calls it the library. Nobody calls it anything.\n\nExcept I did. I called it what it was. I called it what I remembered. I should’ve left it alone.\n\nBut if you grew up where I did, you probably remember the old card catalog. Not digital. Not even electric. Real wood, metal handles, rows of tiny drawers labeled in that fading plastic sticker tape. You’d open one and hear the squeak of swollen wood rubbing against more swollen wood. The cards smelled like glue and mold. If you stayed still long enough, you’d start to think the drawers were breathing.\n\nThat’s the memory that came back when I walked past the building for the first time in years. The sidewalk was cracked. Some of the bricks from the library wall had fallen and were never picked up. The front doors were chained shut, but I noticed something weird. The chains were new.\n\nClean. Tight. Bolted into the frame like whoever put them there wasn’t trying to keep people out.\n\nThey were keeping something in.\n\nI circled around the back and found the basement entrance. I used to sneak in there as a kid with a flashlight and a bottle of soda I wasn’t supposed to have. The lock was gone. Not broken. Just gone. Like someone had taken it off neatly and left no trace.\n\nIt smelled the same. Old paper, wet stone, something else underneath. Something I didn’t remember but recognized anyway. A kind of metallic rot. Like rust if rust had a temperature.\n\nI only took three steps in before I found it. The card catalog.\n\nIt shouldn’t have been there. The basement wasn’t where they kept it. That thing used to sit proudly near the front, right past the information desk. But here it was, shoved into the center of the concrete floor like it had been dragged there and left in a hurry.\n\nI don’t know what possessed me to open a drawer. Maybe it was the smell. Or the silence. Or the way my aunt’s last words kept humming in the back of my head like static.\n\nI pulled open the second drawer from the top.\n\nThere was only one card inside.\n\nIt had my name on it.\n\nNot just my name. My address. My date of birth. The name of my ex, who moved away last spring. My blood type. I didn’t even know my blood type. But it was there.\n\nTyped in red.\n\nAll of it.\n\nI flipped the card over, and there were words written in a shaky, angular hand. Not typed. Not neat. Like it had been scribbled in the dark:\n\n*“you shouldn’t be here.”*\n\nI dropped the card and slammed the drawer shut.\n\nThat should’ve been it. That should’ve been enough. I should’ve turned around and left that place behind me, gone home, booked a flight, burned the house down if I had to.\n\nBut I didn’t.\n\nBecause right as I turned to leave, I heard it.\n\nA drawer opening.\n\nNot behind me. Not in front of me.\n\nAll around me.\n\nI don’t know how to explain it. The catalog drawers, they weren’t just drawers anymore. They were mouths. Hollow little mouths yawning open one by one in slow succession, metal clacking, wood creaking. It was like a song played in a language I wasn’t supposed to understand.\n\nAnd they weren’t empty.\n\nEvery drawer had a card.\n\nEvery card had a name.\n\nAnd I recognized every single one of them.\n\nPeople I knew. People I’d forgotten. People I hadn’t met yet.\n\nAnd the worst part?\n\nSome of the cards were blank. Just waiting.\n\nThe drawer behind me slammed shut. I didn’t even look. I just ran.\n\nI tripped on the stairs. Skinned my hands and knees on the way up. Didn’t feel it until hours later.\n\nWhen I got outside, the air felt wrong. Heavier somehow. Like the pressure had changed while I was in there. Like something else had come out with me.\n\nI haven’t been back since. Not inside.\n\nBut sometimes at night, when I’m trying to sleep, I hear drawers opening.\n\nJust one at first.\n\nThen another.\n\nAnd another.\n\nUntil it’s all I can hear.\n\nThat soft sliding wood. That cold click of metal.\n\nThat breathing.\n\nI think it’s reading me.\n\nI didn't sleep that night. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the drawers opening, heard the soft sliding of wood, the click of metal handles. The image of my name, typed in red, burned into my mind.​\n\nThe next morning, I tried to convince myself it was a dream. A hallucination brought on by stress and grief. But the scrape on my knee, the splinters in my palm, told a different story.​\n\nI needed answers.\n\nI returned to the library, this time in daylight. The building looked even more decrepit under the sun. The chains on the front doors still gleamed, too new for a place forgotten.​\n\nI circled to the back, found the basement door ajar. The air inside was stale, thick with the scent of mildew and something else—something metallic.​\n\nThe card catalog stood where I'd left it, drawers closed. I approached cautiously, half-expecting them to spring open. They didn't.​\n\nI opened the drawer with my name. The card was gone.​\n\nIn its place was a new card, blank except for a single line:​\n\n*\"Reading Room.\"​*\n\nI remembered the Reading Room from my childhood—a spacious area on the main floor, filled with long tables and tall windows. But the main floor had been inaccessible, the front doors chained.​\n\nI searched the basement, found a narrow staircase leading up. The door at the top was unlocked.​\n\nThe Reading Room was bathed in a sickly yellow light filtering through grime-covered windows. Dust motes danced in the air. The tables were gone, replaced by rows of chairs facing a blank wall.​\n\nOn each chair sat a person. Motionless. Eyes closed. Breathing shallow.​\n\nI recognized some of them—neighbors, teachers, people I'd known. All seated, as if waiting for something.​\n\nA low hum filled the room, growing louder. The wall flickered, revealing a projection—a grainy video of the card catalog, drawers opening and closing.​\n\nThe people in the chairs began to speak in unison, reciting names, dates, events. Their voices overlapped, creating a cacophony of memories not their own.​\n\nI backed away, heart pounding, and fled down the stairs, out of the library, into the daylight.​\n\nThe whispers followed me home.​\n\nThe house felt wrong when I got back. I kept the lights off, like maybe it would make me less noticeable. Like if I didn’t move too much, whatever followed me wouldn’t see me.\n\nBut the whispers didn’t care about the dark. They moved through the walls, the floor, the vents. They filled the cracks in the wood and the gaps around the windows.\n\nAt first, it was little things. I’d hear my name in the background of songs on the radio. See flickers of myself standing in reflections that didn’t match my movements.\n\nThen the television turned itself on. Static.\n\nThick, heavy static that crackled and buzzed, louder than it should have been. The screen showed nothing but white noise, but if I stared long enough, I could almost make out shapes moving behind it.\n\nIt got worse after midnight.\n\nThe static started to bleed out of the TV, dripping into the air, weighing down the room like fog. I couldn’t breathe right. I couldn’t think straight.\n\nI smashed the TV with a hammer from the garage. The glass shattered in a spray of dust and black. For a second, the room was quiet.\n\nThen the phone rang.\n\nI didn’t want to answer it. I let it ring until the machine picked up, but when the message played, it wasn’t my voice.\n\nIt was me, but not.\n\nThe recording said, *\"You have been selected for documentation. Your story is incomplete.\"*\n\nClick.\n\nThe dial tone screamed in the empty house.\n\nI tried to leave. Keys, wallet, shoes—out the door. I didn’t even grab a jacket.\n\nThe world outside wasn’t right either.\n\nThe sky was that same static gray as the broken TV. The streets were empty, but I could see figures standing in the distance, motionless, facing my house.\n\nRows of them. Hundreds. Maybe more.\n\nAll standing like the people in the Reading Room.\n\nBreathing shallow. Eyes closed. Waiting.\n\nI backed into the house and locked the door. Like it would help.\n\nThe only thing I could think to do was go back.\n\nBack to the library.\n\nMaybe if I gave them what they wanted, they'd stop.\n\nOr maybe it was already too late.\n\nI grabbed a flashlight and went back into the basement. The door closed behind me without anyone touching it.\n\nThe drive back to the library barely felt real. I don’t even remember the stoplights or the turns. It was like I blinked and I was there.\n\nThe building looked worse than before.\n\nThe front windows were dark, smeared over with something like ash or dirt. Half the sign had fallen down. The front door hung open a few inches, just enough to feel like it was waiting for me.\n\nI parked on the curb and left the car running.\n\nI don’t know why.\n\nMaybe some part of me thought I could outrun whatever this was.\n\nThe second I stepped inside, the air changed. It was thick and heavy, like stepping underwater. The smell was worse now too, sharp and sour, like paper left to rot.\n\nThe lights buzzed overhead, flickering.\n\nRows and rows of books stretched into the dark. Way more than I remembered. Way more than should have fit inside the building.\n\nAnd the shelves.\n\nThey moved.\n\nThey didn’t walk or shake or sway. They breathed.\n\nSlow, rising and falling motions, like lungs struggling to pull in air.\n\nI kept moving, flashlight sweeping side to side. Every time the light landed on a shelf, it stilled. But out of the corner of my eye, I saw them moving. Contracting. Expanding.\n\nThe Reading Room was up ahead, down a long aisle that hadn't been there before.\n\nIt was darker there, darker than it should have been.\n\nAnd I could hear something.\n\nPages turning.\n\nDozens of them.\n\nHundreds.\n\nThe sound layered over itself, louder and louder, until it was deafening.\n\nI covered my ears and stumbled forward.\n\nWhen I finally broke through the last aisle, the Reading Room opened up around me like a throat swallowing me whole.\n\nThe chairs were still there. The tables too.\n\nBut now every seat was filled.\n\nPeople hunched over books, flipping pages faster than should have been possible. Their hands a blur. Their faces blank.\n\nThe librarian was there too. Or what was left of her.\n\nHer figure was half melted into the desk, like wax held too close to a flame. Her mouth stretched open in a scream that never ended.\n\nBut the worst part was the books.\n\nEach one had a name stamped on the cover in heavy black ink.\n\nNames I recognized.\n\nMy parents. My sister. My old classmates.\n\nAnd there.\n\nAt the very front.\n\nA book with my name on it.\n\nStill blank.\n\nStill waiting.\n\nI didn't want to touch it. Every part of me screamed to run.\n\nBut my hand moved on its own.\n\nI reached out and opened it.\n\nAnd the world broke apart."},"75":{"title":"How I met Milou","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k80il8\/how_i_met_milou\/","flair":null,"author":"Saturdead","selftext":"I was born a burden. My parents said it jokingly, but I could tell it’d always been on their mind. Even as an infant, I had bronchiolitis, hypersensitive skin, and several infections. My mother used to say that I was made as if God was tired of looking out for me, and handed it all over to my parents.\n\n“He couldn’t be bothered anymore,” she’d half-joke.\n\nI was a sickly child in a healthy family. I had three older brothers and two younger sisters. And while one affliction would disappear, it would just make way for another. Bronchiolitis gave way to asthma. Infections gave way to allergies. Sensitivity gave way to eczema. Add a mix of violent migraines, bad eyesight, and car sickness, and you have 8-year-old me.\n\n \n\nI grew up near a vineyard. If you continue east from Toulouse, past Gaillac and Albi, you find this long stretch of road piercing through a sparse forest, opening to the colorful rolling hills of southern France. A lot of people just think “Champagne” when they think of French wine, but there is so much more to it. My father used to say that before we had a country, we had wine.\n\nNow, while we didn’t live on the vineyard itself, my family owned it. My father had worked those lands since he was a boy, and me and my brothers were expected to do the same. My sisters too, but in another way. But this isn’t like in the movies, where we bike down some road with a half-cocked beret and baguettes in our baskets – this was *hard* *work*.\n\nWe’re talking chemicals, heavy machinery, inspections, quality testing. Traditions have to evolve to satisfy a modern market. So when I say hard work, I don’t mean leisurely strolls down lanes of grapes. I mean dragging boxes of equipment, filling out paperwork, loading up trucks, sitting in meetings with suppliers, paying taxes, and reaching seasonal work quotas.\n\n \n\nNow, I couldn’t do all that. I wanted to, but I couldn’t. I couldn’t run very far, and I couldn’t lift heavy things without running out of breath. I’d get headaches from staring at screens. My mom had to do my laundry separate from the others, or my skin would break out in hives from the softener. I had to use special shampoo, and I had to get special buttons and zippers. I had a nickel allergy, and wouldn’t you know it, most zippers and buttons use nickel.\n\nBut I think I could’ve lived with all of that if it wasn’t for my allergy to fur.\n\nAll my siblings wanted was a pet, but my allergies were too strong. If they were at a friend’s house, and that friend had a cat, I could get a reaction. It got so bad at times that I had to stay in the car while they went grocery shopping, in case someone at the store had a dog. I did have some medication for it, but it made me sleepy and nauseous – not a good combination for longer car rides.\n\n \n\nI remember once when my brother, Maurice, snapped at my parents. He was five years older and had just crossed the line into teenager. We were all sitting down for dinner, and I was having a reaction to something in the soup. My parents argued whether it was the tomatoes or the spring onions. My mom had aired out the house earlier that day, so it might just be pollen from the garden. Maurice couldn’t take it.\n\n“Every day!” he yelled. “Every day there’s something new! Why do we even bother keeping him alive?!”\n\nOf course, my mother scolded him, but it didn’t matter. He was furious.\n\n“We would be so much better without you,” he continued. “We could have so much. We could go anywhere, do anything. Now we’re all stuck with you.”\n\nHe stormed out, screaming all the way up the stairs to his room.\n\n“I’d rather have a dog than you as my brother!”\n\n \n\nThing is, he wasn’t wrong. He was just saying the quiet part out loud. I suppose that’s the worst of it.\n\nThat night, I went out into the woods. I’d taken one of my allergy pills so I wouldn’t get sick from the trees, but I could feel my legs dragging from the side effects. I had filled my pockets with a small pharmacy – the standard kit for leaving the house.\n\nI wanted to find Maurice a dog. It was a stupid idea, but I really wanted him to like me. Of course, there aren’t many stray dogs roaming the French countryside, but I didn’t think that far. I was upset, and I didn’t want to be a burden anymore.\n\nI wandered through those woods for hours, calling out for something to find me. Something I could show everyone. I just wanted to do good.\n\n \n\nIt got too dark to keep going, so I decided to head back. I was disheartened. I’d made a fool of myself, again.\n\nThen I heard a splash.\n\nThere were puddles in the woods from the afternoon rain, and something was splashing around in it. Something small. A frog, perhaps. I got down on my knees, letting the mud soak into my freshly cleaned jeans. Sorry, mom.\n\nI felt around with my hands and touched something poking against the tip of my finger. I recoiled.\n\n“Sorry,” I said. “I don’t want to hurt you.”\n\nI felt around a little more – carefully. Something the size of my thumb was moving around in the mud. Not a frog, but something equally slimy. I held my hand flat, inviting it to be picked up.\n\n“What are you?” I asked. “You’re not a frog.”\n\nIt crawled into my hand and lay there. I held it up to my face, trying to see what it was. It didn’t move. Something black, with a ridge along the spine.\n\n“You wanna come home with me?” I asked. “Or you can stay, if you want.”\n\nI put my hand back down, but it didn’t leave. I couldn’t help but to smile. I think that was the first time something willingly chose to stay with me.\n\n \n\nBut it was late, and my parents were out looking for me. I hurried into one of the storerooms and got a jar. I filled it with some rainwater and dropped my new friend in. I left the jar open if it wanted to leave, apologizing profusely, and promised I’d be back in the morning. I hid it on the far side of the house, near a pile of raked leaves.\n\nMy parents were furious, of course, but mostly just worried. Maurice got a severe talking-to, which didn’t make things better. Not only had I been a burden to him, now he got in trouble because of it. I was probably in for a beating.\n\nI had trouble sleeping that night, trying to imagine what my friend in the jar looked like. Maybe it was a frog, after all. Like a really cool, black, punk rock kind of frog.\n\n \n\nThe next morning I hurried outside to check on the little creature. I picked up the jar and noticed how it had curled up in the bottom of it, trying to submerge itself completely in the water. I hadn’t filled the jar that well, and hadn’t considered that it might need more water. Was it some kind of fish? Strange.\n\nI remember standing there in my flip-flops and jammie bottoms. Fog was rolling off, giving way to the early morning sun. My hands were chilly as I filled the jar with water from a garden hose and held it up against my face to get a better look. The creature was about as long as a middle finger, and blacker than coal. I could clearly see the spine of it, where little spikes poked out, but I couldn’t make out what kind of creature it was. It had the head of a trout, but the body of a snake. It had gills with long tendrils coming out the side.\n\nAs soon as I filled the jar up, it came to life, twirling and rolling around the jar. Almost like a dance. Then it looked at me with dark, expressionless eyes.\n\n“I’ll call you Milou,” I smiled. “And we’re gonna be best friends.”\n\nCan you tell I was a Tintin kind of kid?\n\n \n\nI decided to keep Milou hidden from my siblings. Maurice was still a bit salty about getting yelled at, so I figured it was best not to show him something he could use to hurt me. I’d never had a pet, and chances were, I’d never get one. So I decided to keep Milou hidden away.\n\nI fed him little bits and pieces. Grapes from the vineyard, of course. Ants. Flies. And little bits and bobs I could squirrel away from my dinner and breakfast. He took his time with it, but seemed to like all of it. He also enjoyed having little things to play with, so I’d drop in little plastic soldiers and rocks and stuff. I would imagine him as a sea monster, towering over the little soldier guys. My own little kraken.\n\n \n\nAfter a couple of days, I noticed a weird smell coming from the jar, so I decided to take it inside to clean. I waited until no one was home, got a fresh jar from the storeroom, and hurried into the kitchen. My heart was pounding as I opened the jar, only to feel this eye-watering burn in my nose. I was having an allergic reaction to something. I filled the fresh jar with water and tipped Milou into it before pouring the old water down the drain.\n\nI hurried back outside and almost dropped him. I had to sit down and take my asthma medication, wheezing for air – apologizing between coughs.\n\n“I’m sorry,” I cried. “I’m sorry, I don’t know what-“\n\nI looked down at Milou. He’d pressed his little fish head against the glass, looking at me with eyes wide open. Even without a single muscle to express emotion, I could tell; he was worried.\n\nThere was something in that discarded water that got my allergies flaring up, that much I figured out. I tried running the tap in the kitchen to get rid of the smell, but I could still feel it. By the time my mother got back, I was scared she might notice it. Instead, she walked in with a smile.\n\n“Did someone pick flowers?” she asked. “It smells wonderful.”\n\n \n\nAs my secret routine turned from days into weeks, I picked up on a few things. Milou would do something to his water. Something I was very allergic to, but that others seemed to enjoy. If I got some of it on my hands, I’d get this terrible rash, but the smell was, to others, wonderful.\n\nThere was one time when I was cleaning out the jar when my dad burst through the front door. He was probably just home to get his lunch. I hurried out the back door, leaving the dirty thing on the kitchen counter. It was free from rocks and twigs this time, but the smell was as powerful as ever. It made my insides itch.\n\nBut dad wasn’t reacting like that at all. I saw him from the kitchen window, lifting the jar. Turning it over, looking it up and down. Sniffing it. Tasting it with the tip of his tongue.\n\nThen downing it in six big gulps.\n\n \n\nOf course, Milou grew. The tendrils extending from his gills got longer, and his jaw grew into a sort of underbite. His scales looked stronger and had a bit of a shimmer to them. I had to upgrade him from a jar to a pot. We had a couple in storage, but I realized he didn’t enjoy it. He wanted something transparent. He liked to *look*. He’d float around, wiggling his tail, keeping his head upright. And he’d just sit there, for hours, observing.\n\nWe had an old fermentation jar in the garage. My grandfather once used it to make preserves, but it hadn’t been used for a while. It was larger than my head, so there was plenty of space for Milou to grow. It also helped that it was entirely made of glass. It also had a tap, so I could get some of the wastewater out without having to rinse through the entire thing.\n\nIt was good enough. There was a corner in one of our old sheds where I knew no one ever looked, and I tried placing Milou there – but he objected. He’d tap his head against the glass, pointing me back outside.\n\n“I don’t know where to put you,” I said. “I have to keep you safe.”\n\nHe tapped his head against the glass again. He was right – I couldn’t keep him locked in the dark.\n\n \n\nThere’s a hill overlooking the property, right by the edge of the forest. The ground there was softer and covered in moss. I found a spot near one of the trees and dug a hole. I put Milou’s jar in it, but not all the way up. I left part of it above ground; like a window. I covered the rest in leaves and moss. I sat down next to him. No more tapping against the glass – he was happy.\n\n“I’ll try to get you a cricket tomorrow,” I said. “And maybe some other stuff.”\n\nMilou did a little spin. Dark eyes looked up at me from the back of the jar.\n\n“Do you need anything?” I asked.\n\nI wasn’t expecting a response, but he tapped against the glass. He’d done so many times, but now it seemed more deliberate. I thought about it for a moment.\n\n“Do you really understand me?”\n\nTap again.\n\n \n\nI leaned my head down close, coming up eye to eye with the creature. He never blinked and only moved enough not to sink to the bottom.\n\n“Do you know you’re Milou?”\n\nTap. He knew.\n\n“Do you like me?” I asked.\n\nHe stopped for a moment to look at me. Turning its head side to side, as if to get a better view of me. My heart sunk a little. Then, out of the blue, he tapped again. It was clear as day. We were friends.\n\n \n\nA couple of days later, I went back up there to change the water in his jar. It started out well enough, but I ended up spilling a whole jar of wastewater on me. I had to put him back and hurry back to the house to change my clothes before my throat swelled up.\n\nI ran through the kitchen. My dad was sitting down with my sisters, talking to them about homework. As I passed by, he called out to me, then followed me into the washroom. I changed my pants and tried to hide the stains, but he was right behind me.\n\n“What’s that smell?” he asked. “Where’ve you been?”\n\n“Out,” I said. “In the forest. I didn’t go far, I wasn’t by the lake or anything.”\n\nHe took the stained pants from the laundry basket. To me, it smelled like an asthma attack waiting to happen, but to him it was something different.\n\n“Is that… wildflowers?” he asked. “Some kind of… melon?”\n\nI didn’t answer. I just washed my hands. I could feel a rash coming on. Dad leaned down and looked me in the eye.\n\n“Did you make that lemonade before?” he asked. “The one in the jar, on the counter?”\n\n“It’s just water,” I said. “It’s not lemonade.”\n\n“Everything is water,” he smiled. “Even wine. But did you make it?”\n\n“Sort of.”\n\nHe smiled at me and gave me a pat on the shoulder. I think it was the first time I saw him really approve of me.\n\n“You should make more,” he said. “It was fantastic.”\n\n \n\nI went back to Milou every day, having little chats about everything and nothing. I told him about what my dad said, and he seemed excited. Milou didn’t seem to mind at all. I was a bit skeptical – I didn’t want anyone to find Milou, or to ask questions. So the next time I cleaned out the jar, I saved his water in bottles and filled them with wildflowers. That way it looked authentic, like I made something.\n\nDad had never really encouraged me to make things on my own before. I wanted to make him proud. I’d seen my parents make everything in that kitchen for years, so I knew where everything was. I cleaned the bottles up, added some honey and fennel, and made my own label. I was kinda clever. I was afraid I might slip up the name Milou someday, so I made it the label. That way, no one would bat an eye if I mentioned it.\n\nThat night, as my family gathered around the dinner table, I took out every bottle of “Milou” that I’d chilled during the day. Everyone got their own bottle. I told them that dad liked it, and that I hoped they would too. They didn’t know what to make of it at first. But they opened their bottles, and it fizzed a little like a light sparkling wine. And after that first sip, their frowns melted away.\n\nFor the first time, there were smiles all across the table. And not just any smile – they were smiling at *me*. They *loved* it. They loved *me*.\n\n \n\nAll summer and well into autumn, I kept up my secret routine. Milou was large enough to have an entire meatball for dinner by then. He was longer than my foot but still had plenty of space to grow. I’d feed him, talk to him, clean his jar, and give him things to play with. But he was getting tired of toys and rocks – he wanted something new. He’d tell me with little taps on the glass.\n\nI did this thing where I took old newspapers and cut out pictures. I’d lick them and stick them to the glass for Milou to look at. He *loved* them. Especially pictures of people, those were the most interesting to him. He always lingered a little longer on pictures where they smiled.\n\nI continued to make my bottles of “*Milou*” about once a week. I told them it was my secret recipe. My father would bring home honey and fennel for me to use. Sometimes he’d bring cherries, or some fruit. We’d spend some time together making up recipes, and he encouraged me to experiment. To me it all just smelled like burning acid, but feeling useful made my heart swell with pride. I wasn’t just taking – I was finally giving back.\n\nI told them I couldn’t drink it myself, and that it burned me. They didn’t even question it. But they all enjoyed it nonetheless. Even Maurice.\n\n \n\nThis kept going for an entire year. I had the best birthday of my life, where my family whole-heartedly celebrated me. It wasn’t just an obligation, they were happy to. I was getting invited into conversations. They asked my opinion on things. On New Year’s Eve, I even heard my dad drunkenly brag about my drink to a neighbor. I wasn’t just a sick boy – I was in the family *business*.\n\nThere was some tension though. I’d often find Maurice out in the fields, or in the kitchen, trying to replicate my recipe. He couldn’t make it, and it frustrated him to no end. He explained to me, in no uncertain terms, that he would make something better. He wouldn’t be beaten by someone who could die from goddamn *fabric* *softener*.\n\nBut dad was thinking of other things. Bigger things. So come spring, we made our first bottle of wine using water from Milou as dilution. It’s usually done to balance out the sugar levels, but dad thought it could give it a ‘colorful musky tone’. Not that I knew what the hell that meant back then.\n\n“Mineral water might not change the taste,” he said, “but it can change the way it feels. And with this?”\n\nHe held up my bottle, giving it a cheeky little shake.\n\n“With this, it will feel like a mother’s *kiss*.”\n\n \n\nI remember the day we finished the wine. Dad poured it into a small glass. He let it rest a little. We sat quietly around the kitchen table, waiting patiently. He smelled it. Twirled it. Observed the color and the consistency. And when he finally tasted it, his eyes went wide. He put down the glass and smiled at me like he’d won the lottery.\n\nHe swept me up on his shoulder and hurried outside, holding the bottle as he went. He called out to my mom to try the glass in the kitchen. He put me down and we ran all the way out to the field workers. Two of them were off to the side, having a cigarette. Dad handed over the bottle.\n\n“Tell me,” he said. “Tell me that isn’t the best thing you’ve ever had.”\n\nThe worker, Claude, had a sip straight from the bottle. He thought about it. Then something just *clicked*. A smile melted onto his face, and he laughed. He handed the bottle to the other worker with a loud ‘*whoo!*’. Others came to look. Everyone got to try it. All the while, my dad went around to them, one by one.\n\n“My son made this!” he laughed. “My son did!”\n\nThere were pats on my shoulder. They ruffled my hair. They lift me up and cheered. They passed the bottle around, emptying it sip by sip.\n\n“Best damn thing I’ve ever tasted,” someone said.\n\n“It’s soft. How can it be so soft?”\n\n“It *melts* me. I love it!”\n\n \n\nAfter that, things were wonderful, but complicated.\n\nDad really wanted me to give him the recipe. He wanted to put it into production. But of course, I couldn’t do it. He couldn’t understand why, and I couldn’t blame him. I was just a kid. I hated lying to him, but he’d be horrified if he knew the source. He wasn’t mad about it. Just disappointed.\n\nMaurice, on the other hand, had plans of his own.\n\n \n\nOne day, as I finished cleaning Milou’s jar, I noticed Maurice. He’d been following me. I thought I’d been clever, hiding the empty bottles in my school bag, but he must’ve heard the clinking. He hadn’t spotted Milou and the jar yet, but it was just a matter of time. He walked up to me with a smug smirk.\n\n“You hide them up here?” he asked. “What are you using?”\n\nHe looked around, kicking some leaves. I didn’t say a thing or move a muscle. It felt like facing a predator – like movement might trigger him.\n\n“I don’t get it,” he continued. “Is it mushrooms? Roots?”\n\nHe picked up a rock and looked at me. I didn’t meet his gaze. That was, apparently, the wrong thing for me to do. He threw the rock at me. I ducked, he missed, and it hit the side of Milou’s jar. It didn’t break. Didn’t even get a scratch.\n\nBut it made a noise.\n\n \n\nMaurice pushed me aside.\n\n“No!” I yelled out. “Please, don’t!”\n\nBut that just spurred him on more. He pushed the moss and the dirt aside, finding the top of the jar. He grinned as he twisted the lid. The moment it popped open, I’d pulled out a bottle from my pack and held it like a club.\n\n“Stop it!” I said. “Or else!”\n\nHe stopped. He dropped the lid. He turned to me. Older, stronger, healthier. He was better in every way – and yet, I’d threatened him. He wasn’t having it.\n\n \n\nHe wrestled me to the ground and beat me. I’d never been in a fight with him before. Not like that. It was just malice, through and through. He was enjoying himself, showing how powerless I was.\n\nAs I lay with my face in the mud, I looked over at Milou’s jar. I saw something peak over the edge. Dark, expressionless eyes. The long face of a trout, opening its mouth in a silent scream.\n\nAnd then he began to shiver.\n\n \n\nMaurice rolled off me. He was having a seizure. It’s as if he was mirroring Milou’s shaking. His eyes rolled back in his skull, and his fingers were making these weird twitching movements. He was frothing at the mouth – and the bubbles smelled like Milou’s water.\n\nI went from relieved to terrified. I rolled Maurice over, slapping him on his back. He kept coughing up this white foam, gasping for air. His eyes had turned an unnatural black, mirroring the color in Milou.\n\n“It’s okay,” I waved at Milou, trying not to think of my broken lip. “It’s okay. It’s okay, Milou.”\n\nHe stopped shivering. He just rested his head at the edge of the jar.\n\n \n\nThen, Maurice spoke.\n\n“Are you alright, friend?”\n\nIt was his mouth, but not his voice. A deep, croaking rumble. I could see a tremble in his throat, like something was about to emerge. Something pushing against the skin. My eyes went from Maurice, to Milou, and back again.\n\n“Are you doing that?” I whispered.\n\n“He will not hurt you,” Maurice said. “I will make sure.”\n\nMaurice wasn’t moving. I couldn’t even tell if he was alive. Was he breathing, or shaking?\n\n“How do you do that?” I asked.\n\n“I go swim,” he answered. “I can swim very far.”\n\nI didn’t have to say thank you. Milou just plopped back into his jar. As he did, Maurice’s eyes returned to a cold natural gray. He bent over, screaming from a stomachache, and couldn’t stop throwing up. He had no idea what’d happened.\n\nBut he knew he’d lost.\n\n \n\nI felt like the king of the hill. Maurice had to stop bothering me. I felt confident. I had a friend looking out for me, and he was stronger than everyone. So the next time my dad asked me to help with the wine, I said yes – but on my terms. He couldn’t touch the dilution tank. No one could. Just me.\n\nHe agreed.\n\nIt was mid-July when we got the tank set up. It was like a small swimming pool. No one was around when I dropped in Milou.\n\n“You can’t look out” I said. “But you’ll hear people all day. Is that okay?”\n\nHe tapped his head against the metal siding. He was okay with it. He had so much more room to grow. He was already the size of my leg.\n\nI had a stupid idea. I borrowed a beach ball from the shed and climbed into the tank with Milou. It was cold and dark, but I trusted him with every fiber of my being. He was my best friend, and he would never hurt me. The water was fresh, so I wouldn’t get a reaction. Instead, I blew the ball up and passed it to him. He passed it back. And before I knew it, we were playing catch, bouncing it back and forth, my laugh echoing against the hollow steel.\n\n \n\nThings would progress from there. Dad would make a trial batch using Milou. He’d hand the bottles off to his workers and took a couple to a sommelier in Marseilles. It was a hit. That first test run, tentatively named “Ami de Milou”, ran out almost immediately. This was turning from a passion project to commercial sales.\n\nThe whole thing was getting out of hand. I had to yell at workers to not investigate the dilution tank. My dad would wave me off. He kept his promise to leave me in charge of the tank, but I could tell he was about to budge. I could see it all slipping between my fingers. I was getting pushed out of the equation. Then again – why wouldn’t I be? You can’t rest an industry on the shoulders of a child.\n\n \n\nOne night, I saw my dad climb up to check the dilution tank. He wanted to grab a sample to have it analyzed. He had promised me a hundred times over that he wouldn’t do it, but he did it anyway. I didn’t understand that he needed to make sure there were no pollutants, and that it was safe to drink. You can’t put mystery recipes on store shelves.\n\nBut I didn’t care. I felt betrayed. So I let him open, and look.\n\nThe moment he opened the water tank, his eyes glazed over. He stumbled down the ladder, as if learning how to walk. He wasn’t shaking, like Maurice had done. It’s as if he had climbed down a new person. Like a *new* new person. Someone who didn’t know how to use his body.\n\nMy dad’s new dark, expressionless eyes settled on me. He smiled.\n\n“Friend,” he gargled. “*Best* friend.”\n\n \n\nOver the next few weeks, I noticed things. I saw Claude putting down a crate of filters just to stare at the sky. I saw my sister’s eyes turn dark as she watched the TV, forgetting to blink. My brothers would sit on the floor next to the fridge, tasting jams and sauces straight from the jars. Milou was using his newfound strength to look beyond the tank, using the eyes of anyone who had drunk from his waters.\n\nI remember my father coming home with dark eyes. My mother had them too. They started kissing in the hallway. But not, like, nice kissing. I’d never seen them like that before. They were pushing, biting, grabbing. I’d never seen adults act like that before. They hurried up the stairs and I didn’t see them for the rest of the night. We missed dinner.\n\nBut it wasn’t all the time. Most of the time it was normal. Until it wasn’t.\n\n \n\nI remember my 10^(th) birthday. It was quiet.\n\nI stepped downstairs and into the dining room. They were all sitting in a circle. My mom and dad. My sisters. My brothers. All their eyes dark, with smiles plastered across their faces. Like they didn’t know how to smile, but tried their best. It looked more like snarling wolves, biting down so hard their jaws trembled.\n\n‘Happy Birthday’, they said as one.\n\nI got the seat of honor. All eyes on me. There was a carrot cake. My dad got up with a kitchen knife. He pushed my sister out of the way so hard she fell off her chair, still smiling. He leaned over the table, smashing his hand down on a plate like his joints were too stiff. It’s a miracle the plate didn’t crack.\n\nHe leaned in with the knife, putting his entire weight on it – and cutting off the tip of his index finger. He didn’t seem to notice.\n\nHe didn’t even cut up a slice. He just cut into the cake because that’s what he’d seen in the pictures. They don’t move in newspaper clippings. With both his hands, he grabbed the cake and pushed the whole thing across the table, dragging the tablecloth along. Every glass was spilled. Every plate rolled onto the floor. Spoons clattered as my siblings toppled over like fallen chess pieces – smiling all the way down.\n\n \n\n“Happy Birthday, friend,” dad gargled. “Best friend.”\n\n“Thank you, Milou,” I stuttered. “Thank you.”\n\n“I *love* you.”\n\n“I love you too, Milou.”\n\nDad sat down on the floor, looking up at me like a curious dog. The one remaining spoon on the table was mine. They all stared in awe, waiting for me to approve. I took a bite of the carrot cake, and their teeth began to chatter. They were so pleased. So, so, pleased.\n\n \n\nI didn’t know what to do. Milou kept reaching further and further away. I’d see people around town walking around with dark eyes. Bus drivers, fruit vendors. I’d see them smelling flowers, running their hands across blue sunflower petals at the shop. Sometimes there’d be groups of them. They wouldn’t even bother speaking like people, they’d gargle amongst themselves, exploring new and visceral sensations.\n\nI’d see them at the library. Ten people reading ten different books at once. I’d see it at school, with our music teacher clumsily slamming their hands on the finely tuned piano. And I’d read about it in articles, where dark-eyed fishermen would disappear on long hauls, only to come back with mysterious barrels. Barrels that would make their way to our dilution tank.\n\nMilou knew what he was doing. He didn’t trust anyone but me, and it served him well.\n\n \n\nOne night, I climbed back up the side of the tank. I opened it, holding my breath as to not choke on the fumes.\n\nMilou had grown. By then he was at least twelve feet long. He’d spun himself into a spiral, resting at the bottom of the tank. All around him were these little black things, no longer than a nail. His kin, from the barrels. I didn’t know what to say. Just opening my mouth made the fumes burn. Milou uncoiled and raised himself out of the water like a cobra. His eyes were bigger than my fists. The spikes along his spine were thicker than my fingers.\n\nJust like with everything else, he’d gotten away from me. He was no longer my pet.\n\nI was *his*.\n\n \n\nHe leaned his head in close. I could see his fangs. Translucent, like glass. He put his mouth against my forehead, as if giving me a tender kiss. It was cold, and it burned. Whatever he was doing, I was still allergic to it.\n\n“You’re hurting me,” I said.\n\nHe leaned back. Now, like then, he understood. He coiled back into the bottom of the tank apologetically, and I climbed back down.\n\n \n\nIt all came to a breaking point in late September.\n\nI woke up one night to cheers and the pitter-patter of running feet. Looking out into the field, I could see torches. They’d started the tractor. They were dragging the tank out into the open, using chains wrapped around the side. It made this long track in the ground, thoughtlessly toppling over grape vines.\n\nI put on my shoes and hurried down the stairs. My siblings were already outside, flailing with their arms and gargling at the night sky. They’d completely abandoned trying to look and sound like people. They even *smelled* like Milou.\n\nThey were all busy. Pushing, chasing, dancing, jumping, and yelling. One of my sisters were on her knees, just staring at the full moon. Claude was playing with a torch, running a blackened hand through the flame. But I couldn’t see mom and dad.\n\nAnd then I did.\n\n \n\nThey were coming out of the storeroom, holding something between them. After a couple of seconds, I could see a head. They were holding someone up, carrying them on their shoulders. A stranger, it seemed. He was waking up.\n\n“Let me… go!” he yelled. “Who are you people?!”\n\nEveryone threw things at him. Grapes. Tools. Gloves. He was bleeding from his forehead. And when he got closer, I could see a gash across his forehead. They’d hurt him.\n\n“What are you doing?” he asked. “What is this?”\n\nThere was no response as they led him up the side of the tank.\n\n \n\nThe moment he looked down, he started screaming, and he couldn’t stop. He was trying to beg, and fight, and run, all at once. But his body was betraying him, and the gathering crowd held him back. I protested, but my voice was too weak. They didn’t hear me. Or maybe they didn’t care.\n\nThey threw him into the water tank. His screams turned from panic to pain. I could hear his voice whip around, as if he was suddenly tugged and pulled in different directions.\n\nThey celebrated. Cheering. Gargling. And as the screaming grew louder, a hand pulled on my finger. My youngest sister, looking up at me with dark, expressionless eyes.\n\n“We want to try,” she said. “To taste. To see.”\n\n“You’re hurting him!” I cried. “Please, you have to stop!”\n\n“I’m just hurting *him*,” she said. “Not *you*. Never *you*.”\n\n“No!” I protested. “This *hurts*! This hurts me too!”\n\n \n\nThat made her pause. For a moment, the movement inside the tank stopped. She held my hand, thinking. Then, a plastered smile returned to her face.\n\n“I have a solution, friend. Best friend.”\n\nShe hugged me. Others followed suit. Mom. Dad. Maurice. The screaming in the tank resumed.\n\nThey pulled me to the ground, wrapping me in a hug. Stroking my hair and cheek. Caring for me. All the while, the screaming in the tank was cut short; replaced with the snapping of bones, and the tearing of flesh.\n\n“I love you,” they whispered. “I *love* you.”\n\nI lay there all night, listening to a man being eaten alive.\n\n \n\nThe following morning, there was a bag outside the front door, and a stranger with a white car. He had covered his eyes with sunglasses. My dad took me by the hand and led me away from the others.\n\n“If it hurts, you can’t look,” he said. “I will take care of you.”\n\n“Wait,” I said. “What are you doing?”\n\n“Taking care.”\n\nThey put me in the car. They tossed Maurice in there too. He looked at me with dark, expressionless eyes.\n\n“I don’t like this one,” he said. “He goes too.”\n\nThey took my things, and they sent me away.\n\n \n\nI stayed with a stranger in Marseilles for a while. Weeks, maybe. Maurice eventually returned to his normal self, but we couldn’t make heads or tails of it. Any of it. We were just kids, we couldn’t do anything. But we had a place to live. People that came and went; giving us food, washing our clothes, and giving us as large an allowance as we ever could’ve wished for. We could play any game. Go anywhere. See anything.\n\nAnd I wish I could say we fought. That we figured out a clever trick. That we were smarter than a strange frog from the woods.\n\nBut we didn’t, and we weren’t.\n\n \n\nThis was a long time ago. Ami de Milou has a different name today. I’ve tried posting it here, but the post gets removed. I think it’s filtered. I am almost 22 years old. I’ve never worked a day in my life. I have a nice car, and a big apartment. Most people think I come from trust fund money. When I say the company name, they always gasp. I’m sure you’ve heard of it too.\n\nI can say what I want, no one will believe me anyway. I’ve sent letters, but they have disappeared in the mail. Calls get disconnected. They sometimes hides the dark eyes behind sunglasses, but I can still tell who has them. They move a certain way.\n\nI can’t pinpoint the moment Maurice and I gave up. Maybe it was the moment we realized we could have ice cream for dinner. Maybe it was when Maurice moved out and got a dog. Or maybe it was on my first birthday away from my family, when a dark-eyed man handed me a birthday card. There were two boys playing with a beach ball on it.\n\n“I love you,” it read.\n\n \n\nThey run other companies now. I know the logos. I see them on fishing boats. On trash collectors. And lately, I’ve sensed a familiar smell coming from the water in the shower. Perhaps there’s a familiar logo at the water treatment plant as well.\n\nI’ve gone back a couple of times, but there’s not much I can do. There are so many to stop me from trying anything. I never get closer than that hill, overlooking what used to be a vineyard. Now there’re walls, and barbed wire. Mostly around the new artificial lake they’ve dug.\n\n \n\nBut I suppose, in a way, I’m lucky. Wherever I go, someone cares. Someone watches, and listens. And if I ever feel lonely, I just walk into a crowd.\n\n“I love you, Milou.”\n\nThat’s all I have to say.\n\nAnd someone, somewhere, will whisper it back."},"76":{"title":"If Heaven is your reward, Hell is my mercy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k8ulyc\/if_heaven_is_your_reward_hell_is_my_mercy\/","flair":null,"author":"Exciting_Ball9852","selftext":"“It's not my fault this isn't fair…”\n\nThis phrase seemed to govern the better part of my life\n\n“It’s not fair!”\n\nLike a forgotten parent\n\n“Yeah, I'll visit you someday. I’ve just been busy, don’t have much time these days.. But I still love you.”\n\n“I didn't know.”\n\nLike those borrowed ten bucks that you keep avoiding\n\n“Yeah, I'll get you back next week. I get paid next week”.\n\n“What was I supposed to do!?”\n\nLike that habit you're trying to drop\n\n“It’s okay, I can always start tomorrow.”\n\nLike that one person in your life you’ve only ever been “friendly” with for too long.\n\n“Yes! I'm going to tell them how I feel this year.”\n\nMy whole life, I lived betting on tomorrow, but when tomorrow ends… when every tomorrow has ended, who but myself will I have left to blame? Despite this, all I could do was keep doing what I’ve always done\n\n“Were you not given free will…”\n\n“Were you not given knowledge…”\n\n“Were you not given guidance…”\n\nThe longer you ignore it, the easier it gets to ignore. That little voice in the back of your head. That was true back then, but now, having to face my excuses head-on, the voice only grew louder as I walked closer and closer to the front of the line.\n\nA billion eyes stood quietly to my left and right, each sending an energetic ray of violent sunshine, silently judging me with their gaze alone. “This wasn’t a fair trial,” I thought. There was no jury of my peers, nor a pricey lawyer to defend me. I’m certain, I’m certain that even if they turned around, they would still see me.\n\nWhile I was lost in my own thoughts, the line moved without my consent. The weight of the innumerable amount of people behind me forced me forward while reminding me that I was surrounded by people, but we’re not the same. I had to continuously lie to myself to keep from crumbling at the reality of my situation. Others looked at peace, some had the same look on their face as me. Again, I was shoved forward, completely incapable of falling out of line due to how tightly packed everyone was. And my bare feet slapped against the smooth, colorless floor. Each step sent a horrible vibrational static through my leg, fading over the rest of my body like a wave reaching its shore. I could no longer tell how close I’ve gotten to the front of the line, all I know is that it felt like standing too close to the bonfire, the extreme heat felt like being repeatedly poked by pins on any part of my body that wasn’t shielded by the person in front of me. I don’t know if it was the heat or my nerves, but my mouth was completely dry. My tongue felt rough against my mouth, talking would be difficult, and there was much I wanted to say.\n\nI was reaching my limit, soon the heat would be too much. I had to get out of here. My eyes were shut tight, but the light relentlessly breached my eyelids. All I could see were powerful scarlet flashes of sardonyx through the thin layer of skin protecting my eyes from certain blinding radiance. Just then, it was unquestionable. I was before Him, my Judge, *The* Judge.\n\n\"So that's it, you're just going to banish me to eternal torture? What, just because I didn't kneel for you? Because you made me like this? What fault of mine is it that you created something so flawed! …I didn't ask for free will, I didn't ask to be born…\" \n\nBut my complaint never even got the chance to manifest on my lips. My knees tore me down to the ground like a magnet meeting its opposite. My body vibrated violently as the shock of striking the ground full force welcomed itself into my bones. I disemboweled myself of every emotion I had in stock without taking a single breath of the air that my body once lived off of. I regretted everything I thought up to that moment, and I knew soon I would pay for that too. I don’t know how long I went on for, but he never rushed me. He didn’t even have to say anything, I knew very well exactly where I belonged. I used to always cope, thinking \n\n“Well, there’s no way eternal torture is real. There can’t be anything I could do here to deserve torment without an ending sentence. There must be something else, maybe we just cease to exist.”\n\nThose weren’t my thoughts exactly. I could never stand to think about it for too long, but subconsciously, I always hoped there would be a third option.\n\nThe eyes were gone, I didn’t seem to be in the same place anymore, and my eyes felt comfortable enough to open. I was somewhere else. There was nothing to see, nothing that could be described in written language. But I wasn’t alone yet. Suddenly, a set of doors appeared somewhere in the distance. I looked around, but I couldn’t tell where he was. I approached the doors. Here I was facing three doors. Each looked different, but familiar, as if they were molded from my childhood memories. Each had a feeling anchored to it. I don’t know exactly how to describe it, but it felt like seeing doors with different colors. I don’t choose to see one as blue and the other as red, they just are. Similarly, looking at each door forced me to feel a certain way without regard for my own will. I approached the first door to my left. From a distance, I felt longing and joy for this door. The closer I got, the stronger the feeling got until I grabbed the handle. The emotion shifted to intense sadness. I turned the handle, and it refused to comply. I turned towards the door in the middle. Fear, despair, dread. My heart was thumping from fear of that door, and hope for the third. Would he really give me my third option? I skipped the middle door and rushed to the handle of the third. Clutched in my hands, I stared at it and felt nothing, the handle wasn’t hot, it wasn’t cold. It wasn’t even neutral. I looked behind me, almost as if to ask for permission to leave. I slowly turned back around, opened the door, and stepped through. \n\nI want to tell you that in the blink of an eye, that in a fraction of a blink of the eye, I was, and then I wasn’t… But I can’t. There was no in between, there was only a before and an after. I want to say, I felt relief, I can’t even say I felt horrified. There was no moment, there wasn’t even “nothing” that word alone simply cannot describe what it was. No, thing can. It was as dark as the Sun. It was as bright as a singularity. It was as bleak as a rainbow. As colorful as a singular ray of white light. It was as short as eternity, and as long as a second.\n\nI was left only with a new emotion. An emotion as foreign as a new color. Indescribable by nature to anyone who hasn’t felt it. Like explaining to a blind person that blue is cold and red is hot. As fleeting as a dream. It was like focusing on a dim star in the night sky. The harder you look, the less you can see. Try to think about when you were born. Try to think about before you were born. I know why we can’t remember being born now. \n\nWithout another complaint, I turned to the middle door and took my place among the rest. If Heaven is your reward, Hell is my mercy.\n\n"},"77":{"title":"I’m still stuck in my high school.

I should be home by now, but somehow, I’m stuck here, and nothing feels right anymore.\n\nIt started innocently enough. I was packing up my bag after my last class, just like every other day. The bell rang, and students started filing out, talking about whatever plans they had after school. I grabbed my jacket, said goodbye to a few friends, and made my way toward the stairwell. I figured I’d be home in 20 minutes, just like always.\n\nBut as soon as I stepped out into the hallway, everything felt... off. It wasn’t the usual, familiar hallway I’d walked a thousand times. No, this was different. The walls seemed to stretch farther than they should’ve. The tiles on the floor—ones I’d been walking on for years—looked new, but not in a good way. Like they were trying to look older than they were.\n\nAt first, I thought I was just tired, maybe a little distracted. So, I took the stairs down to the ground floor, expecting to see the familiar hallway that led to the front doors. But when I reached the bottom, there was another hallway that I didn’t recognize. I stared at it for a moment, trying to make sense of it. There had never been a hallway there before. The walls were lined with old lockers, the kind that were supposed to be gone years ago. I could’ve sworn I was walking in circles.\n\nI started walking down the new hallway, thinking maybe I was just on the wrong floor. But the more I walked, the more I realized this didn’t make sense. I was still in the same place, but it didn’t feel right. The lockers were all closed, but some of them were slightly ajar, like they hadn’t been used in years. And the light flickering above me—it was like the school was glitching, like it wasn’t quite real.\n\nI walked past the classroom doors—some of them were cracked open, but there was no noise coming from inside. No students. No teachers. Just silence.\n\nThat’s when I ran into someone I knew. It was Jessica from my history class. She looked... fine. I mean, she looked the same, but there was something off about her. When I waved at her, she gave me this weird look, like she didn’t recognize me. She smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes. There was a blankness in her gaze that made my stomach churn.\n\n“Hey, Jess,” I said, trying to shake off the uncomfortable feeling in my chest. “What’s up?”\n\nShe didn’t answer. Instead, she just nodded and walked past me, as if I wasn’t even there.\n\nI don’t know why, but I felt an overwhelming urge to follow her. Maybe I was just trying to make sense of everything. But the more I walked, the more everything felt wrong. I started seeing other faces—students, teachers, but they weren’t... they weren’t real. They moved like they were going through the motions, but none of them looked like they were actually there. Like ghosts in a loop.\n\nI went down to the cafeteria to try to clear my head. I figured if I could just get a snack or sit down for a minute, I’d feel better. But when I walked in, it was completely empty. No students, no lunch ladies, just... silence. I grabbed a bag of chips from the counter, but the whole place felt cold, sterile. No one was eating. No one was even sitting at the tables.\n\nI tried to shake it off. Maybe the lunch period had ended early, I thought. But then the bell rang again, and it wasn’t the usual bell. It was deep, echoing through the walls, like it was calling to me.\n\nI couldn’t take it anymore. I bolted out of the cafeteria, hoping to find the exit, but the doors wouldn’t open. The hallway stretched out in front of me, and suddenly, I realized I had no idea where I was. Every turn I made just led to another hallway, another set of stairs, another door that wouldn’t open.\n\nI’ve walked for hours. I know it sounds crazy, but it’s true. Hours. I’ve tried everything. I’ve gone up, down, tried to retrace my steps, but the school just keeps... changing. It’s like the walls are shifting, pulling me deeper inside. And the people? They’re still here, but they don’t act like they used to. They just... stare at me, like they’re waiting for something.\n\nI saw Mr. McCarthy, my old chemistry teacher, near the science wing. He looked exactly the same, but when I asked him where the exit was, he just stared at me with this strange expression, like he hadn’t even heard me. Then he pointed down the hallway, but I swear the hallway wasn’t there a second ago. I turned to thank him, but when I looked back, he was gone.\n\nI don’t know what’s happening. I don’t know if this is some kind of nightmare or if I’m just losing my mind, but I’ve been trying to get out for hours. I keep opening doors that lead to more hallways, and the more I walk, the more the school feels like it’s alive.\n\nAnd the worst part? Every time I look at the clock, time is going by slower. It’s almost like the seconds are stretching out, holding me in place. I feel like I’m never going to get out of here.\n\nI think something’s waiting for me. I don’t know what it is, but it’s here. It’s always been here.\n\nAnd now, I’m just waiting for whatever comes next."},"78":{"title":"My Guitar Amp is Pickup up a Radio Station from Hell.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k8dmg8\/my_guitar_amp_is_pickup_up_a_radio_station_from\/","flair":null,"author":"CallMeStarr","selftext":"I was terrified. Still am, if I’m being honest. It’s not everyday your guitar amp gets possessed. Here’s what happened:\n\nMy guitar amp started picking up a random radio station. Initially, it was faint, barely above a whisper. I just grumbled, then went back to practicing whatever I was working on. Probably something by Brandon Lake. The next morning, I’d completely forgotten about it. I had other problems.\n\nThis was a dark period in my life. After spending my 20’s touring in a Christian alt-country band, I’d decided to settle down and find gainful employment. (Is there such a thing, these days?) Perhaps I’d find a partner and get married. Simple pleasures, right? \n\nWell, I did find employment, although I wouldn’t call working at an outlet store, selling shoes, gainful. Around that time, I’d lost interest in playing music. In fact, I’d gone a full year without touching my guitar. I was emotionally drained, having spent most of my young adult life touring crummy venues and crashing in cheap motels.\n\nTo make matters worse, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t find a partner. This saddened me. Probably, that’s why I picked up the old Fender Telecaster again. Shame me if you will, but I knew if I performed at some open jams on the weekend, my chances of finding an interesting partner would greatly improve. It’s worked in the past.\n\nYou see, I’m socially awkward. A wee bit on the spectrum, perhaps. Picking up women was never my forte. I’d sooner sit on a frozen toilet seat then approach some good-looking stranger in a bar. Yikes. And online dating just isn’t my bag, ya dig? Tried once, and failed miserably. I still prefer meeting people the old-fashioned way: in person, even though the process eludes me. When I’m performing music, however, they approach me. It’s how I meet people. It’s my superpower.\n\nAnyways, back to the amp.\n\nThe following weekend, while I was plucking away on my electric guitar, it happened again. My amp was picking up a random radio station. Only this time, it was loud and clear. It scared the hair right off my head (what was left of it, anyways). The deejay spoke in a low-pitched, sardonic voice. Something about his voice sounded off. It was too harsh, for starters. Like a chainsaw. Voices don’t sound like that. Human voices, that is. His drawl was as deep as a Leonard Cohen song. A drawl that can only come from the Deep South. Eastern Kentucky, perhaps. But not quite. It was unlike any voice I’d ever heard.\n\nI live in Saint Paul, Minnesota, in a crummy, one bedroom apartment. Nowhere near the South. So, you can imagine my confusion. The voice speed-talked for about a minute, while I stood stupefied, scratching my head. Ultimately, I chalked it up to a faulty patch cord, and kept picking away at Sturgill Simpson’s version of a Nirvana song. \n\nWhen the deejay spoke my name, I nearly died.\n\n“Hey Noah,” the voice croaked, “you gonna learn to play that thing, or what?”\n\nI dropped my guitar pick and watched it bounce underneath the bed.\n\n“Welcome to WDVL, 666 on your earthly dial!” the voice went on as if nothing out of the ordinary happened, as if he hadn’t just spoken my name. “Hail Satan. He’s the truth, the light, and the darkness.”\n\nThe voice rambled on and on, speaking so fast he barely had time to breathe. Meanwhile, I was trembling, my bladder threatening to burst. That the deejay knew my name troubled me most. I wondered what else he knew. Did he know my faith was weakening? Or that I’m a sinner? With a flick of the wrist, I turned off the amplifier. His grim voice died an awful death.  \n\nI gulped. My right leg was twitching a million miles per hour.\n\nWhat’s going on? \n\nWas something wrong with me?\n\nClearly, there was.\n\nBut what?\n\nI wasn’t taking drugs. I rarely drank alcohol. Nor was I on any meds. I wasn’t a weirdo – the people at work seemed to like me. And I wasn’t living in some random haunted house. This made zero sense.\n\nNeedless to say, I avoided the amplifier, choosing instead to practice on my acoustic guitar. Problem was, I could barely strum the damn thing, my hands were so shaky. That night, sleep was futile. My mind was racing. So, instead of tossing and turning, I did some research and discovered that the problem was, in fact, my faulty patch cord. Just as suspected. The next day, after work, I went to a local guitar store and purchased a new one. Paid a hefty price, but I wanted the very best. Guitar stuff isn’t cheap, lemme tell ya.\n\nWhen I returned home, the guitar amp seemed larger than life, lurking joylessly in the corner of my bedroom, daring me to plug in. Every time I’d pick up my electric guitar, ready to blast out some chords, my anxiety skyrocketed, and I’d put it down. My nerves were shot. I started talking to myself. Not a good sign. I had to do something. This was getting ridiculous. So, at long last, I plugged the shiny new cable into my amp (a Fender '68 Custom Deluxe Reverb, for all you gearheads), and started rocking out.\n\nNothing. \n\nNo devilish deejay, no random radio station. Just pure, angelic Fender tone. Phew! Relieved, I set about working on some Johnny Cash songs. Who doesn’t like the Man in Black? While I was belting out \"Ring of Fire\", giving it all I had, the unthinkable happened: the dreadful deejay returned.\n\n“Hell yes, my son! You will, in fact, burn in a ring of fire! Loooooord below! Satan is the way, the truth and the answer; give unto him, and he shall fulfill your deepest, darkest desires…”\n\nI froze. My tongue felt like a sponge, my hands as big as baseball gloves. My blood turned to ice. Something about the voice paralyzed me. It was like he was in my room, delivering his diabolical sermon directly to me.\n\n“...that’s right, Noah,” he sneered, “give unto Satan, the Loooooord of Death, and he shall deliver salvation. You want a partner? A luscious, beautiful blonde? I’ll bet you do. Or how about a busty brunette? Yessir! A gal that looooooves her country music!”\n\nI unplugged the cord, hoping that would stop him. \n\nIt didn’t.\n\n“Nah!” he continued, louder than before. “What you reeeally need, Noah, my hapless human friend, is a fiery redhead. Loooooord below! One that’ll suck the paint off your porch, if ya know what I mean. Ha ha ha. I don’t care to intrude, Noah, but yer looking awfully thin these days. I do reckon. Aaand…”\n\nI turned off the amp; it crackled and popped, then went silent. My beating heart, which was louder than a bass drum at a rock concert, filled the room. Tears threatened my eyelids. I’d always loved that amp. Had it for years. Suddenly, I was too afraid to even look at it, let alone touch it. What a dilemma. Smartly, I put the guitar back in its case, and shoved the case in the closet. \n\nThen I wept.  \n\nThat night, the deejay visited my dreams. I can’t recall exactly what he said, but I woke up in a pool of sweaty sheets. Worse, my fingertips were encrusted with blood, and I was balding. My once-golden hair was sprinkled across my moist pillow, like evidence. I knew I needed help, but there was no one to turn to.\n\nHaving spent ten years on the road, my only friends were my bandmates, and let’s just say we didn’t end our partnership amiably. Spending that much time with anyone – even your closest friends – can cause serious friction, even in the best of times. And I’m not close with my family; they never approved of my musician lifestyle. I have many acquaintances, but only one true friend, Peter, and he’s going through his own version of hell, (a nasty divorce). So I didn’t reach out. \n\nAfter my morning shower, I put on a fresh pair of Levi's and a plaid sweater. As I was leaving the bedroom, my amp started hissing. The red power light was flickering. When it spoke, I nearly had a heart attack. \n\n“Plug me in,” the deejay said, in a croaky voice. “You’re not scared are you?”\n\nThe rational part of my mind insisted that nothing was wrong. That this was merely my overzealous imagination. Had to be, right? But that didn’t explain the voice. Amps don’t speak. Especially when they’re unplugged. \n\nI shoved the amp in my closet, next to the guitar. \n\nFor the remainder of the week, I avoided the electric guitar and returned to my trusty ol’ acoustic (a Gibson J-100). Life seemed to settle. The following weekend, longing to find myself a partner, I decided to hit up a local jam session. It had been over a year since I’d last performed. I needed this. Problem was, most jam sessions provide inadequate amplifiers. And tone is king. (It’s a guitarist thing.) So, despite my trepidation, I loaded my amp, guitar, and a Tube Screamer overdrive pedal into the van, and drove downtown.\n\nThe house band was fairly decent. Weekend warriors, at best, but nice enough fellas. That they knew who I was certainly boosted my confidence. I’d only done backing vocals in my previous band; now I was to sing lead. Confidence was crucial. When they called me up, we blasted through a Georgia Satellites’ classic, followed by “Tennessee Whiskey”, always a crowd favorite.\n\nAlthough it was a meager-sized audience, I had them in the palm of my sweaty hands. My voice felt strong, and my amp sounded superb. Halfway through “Tennessee Whiskey”, I noticed a redhead wearing a tight Zeppelin tee-shirt giving me dirty eyeballs. She couldn’t keep her gorgeous green eyes off me. I felt invincible. Just like old times. With the two songs completed, the small-but-mighty crowd demanded an encore. \n\nI busted into “Ring of Fire”, and all hell broke loose. \n\nThe drummer kicked off a steady train groove. The bass player locked in nicely. There was a keyboard player on stage providing the much-needed harmony. I played the trumpet bit on the guitar. We nailed the intro. \n\n“Love,” I sang, in a throaty baritone, “is a burnin’ thang.” \n\nThe redhead started dancing. \n\n“...And it makes a fiery ring…”\n\nAs I leaned into the mic, eager to deliver the next line, I got zapped. Electrocuted. I fell with a thud, cracking my head on the side of the stage. The mic stand went flying and slammed the keyboard player in the skull. He went down, too. Amidst the chaos, my amp started speaking. \n\n“This is WDVL, 666 on your earthly dial…”\n\nEverybody stared, stupefied, as I lay sprawled across the stage, twitching.\n\nThe band leader approached me cautiously, “You alright, son?”\n\nI tried speaking, but my lips felt like two balloons. Graciously, he helped me up. As my eyes adjusted, I noticed the redhead walking out of the bar, shaking her head. The remaining patrons chuckled, then returned to their drinks. With a troubled mind and scorched lips, I gathered my gear in disgrace.\n\n“You’re pitiful, Noah,” the deejay pestered. “All hail Lucifer, the Prince of Darkness, the Evil One, Loooooord of the Flies…”\n\nThe hair on my arms stood tall. My mouth was as dry as a musician’s sense of humor. I studied the barroom. Was anyone else hearing this? Apparently, not. Or if they did, they chose to ignore it.\n\nI drove home highly agitated. What the hell’s wrong with my damned amplifier? I pouted. And why me? What did I do to deserve this? Not only was I miserable, I was petrified. I needed to get to the bottom of it, and fast, so I contacted a local luthier (a guitar repair person, for you non-musicians). \n\nWhen I told Steve (not his real name) what was happening, he turned ghost-white.\n\n“Heard of this happening once before,” Steve said in a nasally voice. He ran a large hand through his thinning gray hair, and paused. “Paul Marino,” he said thoughtfully, eyes cast afar. “Poor ol’ Paul is still in the mental hospital. Or whatever it’s called these days. Not allowed visitors, last I heard.”\n\nSteve looked at my amp with suspicion, then smiled awkwardly.\n\nI was as tense as a two-dollar steak. Having just turned thirty-one, I knew I was too young for a mid-life crisis, but that’s how it felt. And I was lonely. Playing guitar was my only outlet. I needed it. Even if only on the weekends.\n\n“Tell ya what,” Steve said, inspecting the amp, “I’m sure it’s nothing. Probably your patch cord. You have your cables on you?”\n\nI did.\n\n“Good!” he said. “Leave 'em with me. I’ll have a look. Come back next week.”\n\nI sighed.\n\nHe turned the amp on and, using my cables, plugged a guitar into it. No radio station. No disreputable deejay. He strummed a G chord; it sounded as sweet as roses. \n\n“Looks fine. Sounds good.” Steve shrugged. “It’s probably nothing but strange karma.” He winked. \n\nWe shook hands, then I left.\n\nIt was a rough week. I could barely concentrate at work, and I no longer felt comfortable at home. I slept on the couch, avoiding my bedroom like the plague. The following week, when I hadn't heard back from Steve, I stopped by his shop after work. The lights were off. The parking lot was deserted. I called him, and it went straight to his voicemail, which was full. An icy chill climbed up my spine. Steve worked late hours. He should be open. \n\nThe following Friday, there was still no word from Steve. My anxiety skyrocketed. I could only imagine what my dreaded amp was doing (or saying) to him. My life was in turmoil. I’d lost weight, and to my chagrin, I’d gone completely bald. Seemingly overnight.\n\nNone of that mattered.\n\nWhat mattered was that people were posting about Steve on social media, asking for information. Apparently, he failed to show up for a band rehearsal, and he missed an important gig. His family and friends were worried sick.\n\nBy now, I was completely freaked out. The cursed amp! What the devil was going on? A question came, one I could do without: what would the deranged deejay do next? My mind jumped to many conclusions, each more terrifying than the last. Was the devil out for revenge? Was he punishing me for quitting my band? He probably hates Christian country bands. Maybe I should play heavy metal? Surely, the devil loves metal. Or perhaps, I should pack up and move to Canada. He’d never find me up there. Too damn cold. \n\nI stayed put. My rational mind was having none of this. Surely this is a case of bad luck. Or as Steve put it, ‘strange karma.’ Another week went by, and still no news of Steve. It was like he’d vanished. \n\nUltimately, I was forced to purchase a new guitar amp.  Truth be told, I was kinda excited. Yeah, I was saddened about Steve – he’d helped me a lot back in the day, working on my road-worn gear – but perhaps a new amp was all that was required. Out with the old, in with the new, as they say.\n\n(Don’t judge. Once a musician, always a musician. I had to do something. Besides, it’s not like I murdered Steve. All I did was bring him a glitchy amp. Repairing amps was his job, for Christ’s sake.) \n\nThus, I bought a brand new Vox AC 30. A classic. \n\nWhen I plugged it in, it sounded wicked-good. No devil, no radio station, just a smooth, velvety tone. The amp soared. I cranked it to eleven and wailed all weekend. It was a blast, although I’m sure the neighbors would disagree.  \n\nRelieved yet anxious, I needed redemption. It was time. I had to return to the local jam session. Perhaps there was still a chance of impressing the redhead. Needing new material, I decided to take a stab at something more challenging: a popular Charlie Daniels’ song. Not an easy feat, lemme tell ya. Playing the fiddle part on guitar would require a heck of a lot of practice and dexterity. But the devil’s in the details, as they say, so I woodshedded all week. \n\nI was extremely nervous. Bizarre amps, missing luthiers, electrical shocks; if only I had someone to soothe my worried mind. A fiery redhead, perhaps. Despite my trepidation, I practiced the Charlie Daniels song as though my life depended on it. And perhaps, it did. \n\nAnother week passed, still no Steve. Surely, an omen. I was coming unglued, but sitting around feeling sorry for myself wasn’t helping, so I returned to the local jam session, toting my brand new Vox AC 30.\n\nThe place was packed. The fiery redhead was there, sipping cocktails in the corner with her friends. The host looked at me peculiarly, but smiled nonetheless. I was terribly nervous about performing the Charlie Daniels song. What if the house band couldn’t handle such a challenging piece. Maybe I should reconsider, and choose an simpler song? \n\nWhen I was called up to perform, a few patrons giggled, including the redhead. Despite my shotty nerves, I played exceptionally well. My guitar soared like an eagle. The Vox delivered what it promised: killer tone. The band was hot. The audience was receptive. After blazing through a Jimmy Reed song “Big Boss Man”, I started to relax. Things were actually going my way! It was time to play the Charlie Daniels song.\n \nThe drummer – a middle-aged Mexican man, with a cop mustache and hefty beer gut – looked uneasy. Nonetheless, he counted off “The Devil Went Down to Georgia”, and away we went.    \n\n“You gonna play that thing, boy? Or stand there looking stupid?” \n\nThe deejay. \n\nHis menacing voice soared through the amp’s speaker, clear as a bell. \n\n“Because I’m in the mood for some fiddlin’. Loooooord Below. Yessir, I am.” \n\nHis voice was as meaty as a porterhouse. \n\nFear paralyzed me. My shaky hands could barely hold the guitar pick. I’d forgotten the words. I didn’t know what to do. Fortunately, singing wasn’t required. Apparently, Satan knew all the words: \n\n“Well, the Devil went down to Georgia,” he sang. “He was lookin' for a soul to steal. He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind. And he was willing to make a deal. When he came across this young man…”\n\nI fainted. \n\nWhen I came to, the barroom had cleared out, the bartender glared at me with contempt. I felt like an imbecile, a total loser. I left immediately. In the confusion, I’d forgotten the amp.  I considered returning for it, but was too embarrassed, so I stayed at home and wallowed in self-pity. \n\n…\n\nI’ve thought long and hard about this decision. Maybe I should’ve gone back for it. Maybe not. Hard to say. Because what happened next still haunts my dreams. \n\nLater that night, in a burning ring of fire, the bar was set ablaze. Foul play is suspected.  \n\nAnd still no word from [Steve.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesFromStarr)"},"79":{"title":"My brother's voice started coming through the baby monitor [Part 5]","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k842qs\/my_brothers_voice_started_coming_through_the_baby\/","flair":"Series","author":"ExceptingAlice","selftext":"[Part 1](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/s\/TnsKELEK6P) [Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/s\/0OaR4HHyuD) [Part 3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/s\/3dzN8MPsGL) [Part 4](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/s\/TgwdsW3Ppw)\n\nWe pulled up to the house and stopped cold.\n\nThere it was.\n\nThe toy horse.\n\nPropped in the front window.\nFacing us.\nLike it had been waiting.\n\nSam hugged Ellie tighter. I killed the engine but stayed frozen, staring back at it. A knot twisted deep in my gut.\n\n“We burn it all,” I said.\n\nSam nodded. Her voice was steady. “The house, the horse. Everything.”\n\nI popped the trunk. The gas cans were ready—two of them, still sloshing from the drive.\nWe circled to the trunk, whispering fast—where to pour the gas, where to light it, how fast we’d have to move.\n\nMid-sentence, Sam stiffened.\n\n“The horse,” she whispered.\n\nI turned back to the house.\n\nThe window was empty.\n\nGone.\n\nBefore I could react, the ground rumbled beneath us—a low, throbbing vibration that climbed up through my shoes and into my bones.\n\nThe air shifted, heavy and sour, and then a sound rolled out from under the house:\nA deep, guttural growl.\n\nThe trees bent under the sudden gust of wind, howling through the yard, clawing at our eyes.\n\nSam shrieked.\n\nEllie was wrenched from her arms by an invisible force.\n\nSam lunged, grabbing at empty air—fingers scraping against the nothing that swallowed our daughter.\n\nAnd then Ellie was gone.\n\nOne second she was there, clinging to Sam’s shirt—\n\n—and the next, nothing but the echo of Sam’s scream.\n\nWe didn’t hesitate.\n\nWe ran.\n\nWe knew exactly where she was.\n\nThe attic.\n\nThe heart of it all.\n\nThe front door crashed open under my shoulder.\nInside, the house was already tearing itself apart.\n\nLights stuttered and sparked.

It’s one of those things I put off every few months, but this time, I decided to take care of it. My closet’s a mess—old clothes from college, jackets that don’t fit anymore, random things I’ve collected over the years. You know the type.\n\nI reached for a jacket that I hadn’t worn in ages, one that was a bit too small but always reminded me of simpler times—walking around campus, running late for classes, just the usual college life. I pulled it out from the back of the closet, shook off the dust, and noticed something odd.\n\nThere was something in one of the pockets. I don’t remember putting anything in it, and I’ve had this jacket for years. I didn’t even know the last time I wore it, but the thought of finding something inside felt… weirdly comforting.\n\nIt was a small, folded piece of paper. The kind of paper that felt old and familiar but still a little crisp. I unfolded it, half expecting to find some stupid receipt or an old ticket from a concert I’d forgotten about. But instead, it was a note, written in my handwriting.\n\nI froze.\n\nIt wasn’t the kind of note I would have written recently—it was my handwriting from years ago. But I’m certain I didn’t write this. The words were clear, precise, and strangely calm. Here’s what it said:\n\n> “Do not open the door at 3:23 AM. Don’t listen to the knock.”\n\n\n\nMy blood ran cold. I didn’t even know what to think. I looked at the clock. It was 3:22 AM.\n\nI checked the time again. 3:22 AM.\n\nHow could this note have been written by me? I haven’t written anything like this in years. I couldn’t remember ever making a note like this, and yet—there it was, in my handwriting, in my jacket pocket, as if it had been placed there just moments ago.\n\nI stared at the paper for what felt like an eternity. The smell of old leather and paper in the room suddenly felt too thick, like the air was closing in on me. I thought about tossing the note, throwing it away, or burning it. But something made me keep reading.\n\n> “I’m not joking. The knock will come. It will be faint at first, but it will get louder. Don’t answer the door. It’s not you on the other side.”\n\n\n\nThat part didn’t even make sense. It made my head hurt just reading it.\n\nBut before I could even make sense of it, the strangest thing happened. I heard it.\n\nA knock.\n\nI know it sounds crazy, but it wasn’t just any knock—it was like someone was tapping on my door, just hard enough for me to hear but soft enough that it almost sounded like I imagined it. I looked up, my heart pounding, and checked the time again: 3:23 AM.\n\nThere it was, just like the note said. My mind raced, trying to rationalize it. Maybe it’s a neighbor. Maybe I’m just hearing things.\n\nI stood there frozen for a while, staring at the door, waiting for more knocks, something, anything. But it didn’t come. For a while, the silence was almost unbearable.\n\nAnd then, I heard it again. This time, it was more deliberate—louder. Almost as if it was an actual person on the other side, someone knocking slowly, methodically, like they knew I was there. But that’s impossible, right?\n\nI’m here alone. No one has keys to my apartment. No one should even know I’m up this late.\n\nI’ve read enough horror stories to know where this is going, but something feels off. This isn’t like any other story I’ve read—this feels personal, like it’s meant for me. That’s what’s scaring me the most right now.\n\nI’m not answering the door. I swear I’m not.\n\nBut every time I look at the clock, it’s like I can feel the time slipping by. The knocking hasn’t stopped. It’s still there, faint, rhythmic, almost a whisper at this point. I can’t tell if it’s just my mind playing tricks on me. Or if it’s something… else.\n\nSo, here I am. Writing this, because I don’t know who else to tell. I don’t know what to do. The note was right—3:23 AM came and went, and now I’m sitting here in the dark, listening to something I can’t explain.\n\nBut if the note was right about that, then what else is true? What else is coming?\n\nI’m scared to find out.\n"},"81":{"title":"Blair, this is Finn. A group of people broke into my house last night, but nothing was stolen. You can have everything.

I mean, I haven’t exactly taken a full inventory of my stuff yet, but it doesn’t seem like anything is missing…”*\n\nThe cop cleared his throat, cutting me off. A loud, phlegm-steeped crackle emanated from the depths of his tree trunk sized throat. Without taking a breath, he smoothly transitioned the sputtering noise into a series of followup questions.\n\n*“Let me make sure I’m getting this right, buddy: you woke to the sound of burglars just…moving your furniture around? That’s it? I’m supposed to believe that a roving band of renegade interior decorators broke in to, what…open up the space a bit? Adjust the Feng Shui?*\n\nHe looked over his shoulder and gave his partner an impish grin. The other officer, an older man with rows of cigarette-stained teeth, responded to his impromptu standup routine with a raspy croak, which was either a chuckle or a wheeze. I assumed chuckle, but he wasn’t smiling, so it was hard to say for certain.\n\nMy chest began to fill with all-too familiar heat. I forced a smile, fists clenched tightly at my sides.\n\n*Let’s try this one more time,* I thought.\n\n*“I can’t speak to their intent, sir. And that’s not what I said. I didn't hear them move the furniture. I woke up to the sound of music playing downstairs. As I snuck over to the landing, I saw a flash, followed by a whirring noise. It startled me, so I stepped back, and the floorboards creaked.”*\n\nThe cop-turned-comic appeared to drop the act. His smile fell away, and he started to jot something down on his notepad as I recounted the experience. I was relieved to be taken seriously. The rising inferno in my chest cooled, but didn’t completely abate: it went from Mount Vesuvius moments before volcanic eruption to an overcooked microwave dinner, molten contents bubbling up against the plastic packaging.\n\n*“I guess they heard the creak, because the music abruptly stopped. Then multiple sets of feet shuffled through the living room. By the time I got to the bannister and looked over, though, they had vanished. That’s when I noticed all the furniture had been rearranged. I think they left through the back door, because I found it unlocked. Must have forgotten to secure the damn thing.”*\n\n*“Hmm…”* he said, staring at the notepad, scratching his chin and mulling it over. After a few seconds, he lifted the notepad up to his partner, who responded with an affirmative nod.\n\n*“What do you think? Has this happened to anyone else closer to town?”* I asked, impatient to learn what he’d written.\n\n*“Oh, uh…no, probably not.”* He snorted. *“I have an important question, though.”*\n\nHis impish grin returned. Even the older cop’s previously stoic lips couldn’t help but twist into a tiny smirk.\n\n*“What song was it?”*\n\nSeething anger clawed at the back of my eyeballs.\n\n*“My Dark Star by The London Suede,”* I replied automatically.\n\n*“Huh, I don’t know that one,”* said the younger cop, clearly holding back a bout of uproarious laughter.\n\nIn that moment, the worst part wasn’t actually the utter disinterest and dismissal. It was that, like the cop, I’d never listened to that song before last night. Didn’t know any other tracks by *The London Suede*, either. So, for the life of me, I couldn’t understand how those words spilled from my lips.\n\nI’d google the track once they left. It *was* what I heard.\n\nAnyway, the cop then presented his notepad, tapping his pen against the paper.\n\n*“These were my guesses.”*\n\nIn scribbled ink, it read *“Bad Romance? The Macarena?”*\n\nIt took restraint not to slap the notepad out of his hand.\n\nGod, I wanted to, but it would have been counterproductive to add *assaulting a lawman* to my already long list of pending felonies. Criminality was how I landed myself out here in Podunk corn-country to begin with, nearly divorced and with a savings account emptier than church pews on December 26th.\n\nSo, I settled for screaming a few questions of my own at the younger of the two men.\n\nFor example: I inquired about the safety of this backcountry town’s tap water, speculating that high mercury levels must have irreparably damaged his brain as a child. Then, I asked if his wife had suffered a similar fate. I figured there were good odds that she also drank from the tap, given that she was likely his sister.\n\nThose weren’t the *exact* words I yelled as those neanderthals trudged back to their cruiser.\n\nBut you get the idea.\n\n\\- - - - -\n\nNo matter how much bottom-shelf whiskey I drank, sleep would not come.\n\nOnce dawn broke, I gave up, rolled out of bed, and drunkly stumbled downstairs to heave my furniture to its previous location. I didn’t necessarily *need* to move it all: my plan was to only be in that two-story fixer-upper long enough to perform some renovations and make it marketable. In the meantime, I wasn’t expecting company, and it wasn’t like the intruders left my furnishings in an awkward pile at the center of the room. They shifted everything around, but it all remained usable.\n\nI couldn’t stand the sight of it, though. It was a reminder that I plain didn’t understand *why* anyone would break in to play music and move some furniture around.\n\nSo, with some proverbial gas in the tank (two stale bagels, a cup of black coffee, additional whiskey), I got back to work. The quicker I returned to renovating, the quicker I could sell this godforsaken property. I purchased it *way* below market-value, so I was poised to make a pretty penny off of it.\n\nBlair would eat her words. She’d see that I could maintain our “standard of living”, even without my lucrative corporate position and the even more lucrative insider trading. It wouldn’t be the same, but Thomas and her would be comfortable.\n\nAfter all, I was a man. I *am* a man. I deserved a family.\n\nMore than that, I couldn’t endure the thought of being even more alone.\n\nIf that was even possible.\n\n\\- - - -\n\n*How did they do all this without waking me up?* I contemplated, struggling to haul my cheap leather sofa across the room, its legs audibly digging into walnut-hardwood flooring.\n\nI dropped the sectional with a gasp as a sharp pain detonated in my low back. The sofa slammed against the floor, and the sound of that collision reverberated through the relatively empty house.\n\nSilence dripped back incrementally, although the barbershop quartet of herniated vertebral discs stacked together in my lumbar spine continued to sing and howl.\n\n*“Close enough.”* I said out loud, panting between the words. My heart pounded and my head throbbed. Sobriety was tightening its skeletal hand around my neck: I was overdue for a dose of spirits to ward off that looming specter.\n\nI left the couch in the center of the cavernous room, positioned diagonally with its seats towards a massive gallery of windows present on the front of the house, rather than facing the TV. A coffee table and a loveseat ended up sequestered tightly into the corner opposite the stairs, next to the hallway that led to the back door. Honestly, the arrangement looked much more insane after I tried to fix it, because I stopped halfway through.\n\nI figured I could make another attempt after a drink.\n\nSo, the sweet lure of ethanol drew my feet forward, and that’s when I noticed it. A small, unassuming square of plastic, peeking out from under the couch. I don’t know exactly where it came from; perhaps it was hidden under something initially, or maybe I dislodged it from a sofa crease as I moved it.\n\nHonestly, I tried to walk past it with looking. But the combination of dread and curiosity is a potent mixture, powerful enough to even quiet my simmering alcohol withdrawal.\n\nWith one hand bracing the small of my aching back, the other picked it up and flipped it over.\n\nIt was a polaroid.\n\nThe sofa was centered in the frame, and it was the dead of night.\n\nWhen I arrived two weeks ago, I had the movers place the sofa against the wall. That wasn’t where it was in the picture. I could tell because the moon was visible through the massive windows above the group of people sitting on it.\n\nAt least, I think it was a group of people. I mean, the silhouettes were undoubtedly people-shaped.\n\nBut I couldn’t see any of their details.\n\nThe picture wasn’t poorly taken or blurry. It was well lit, too: I could appreciate the subtle ridges in the furniture's wooden armrests, as well as a splotchy wine stain present on the upholstery.\n\nThe flash perfectly illuminated everything, except for them.\n\nTheir frames were just…dark and jagged, like they had been scratched out with a pencil from *within* the picture. It was hard to tell where one form ended and another began. They overlapped, their torsos and arms congealing with each other. Taken together, they looked like an oversized accordion compromised of many segmented, human-looking shadows.\n\nNot only that, but there was something intensely unnerving about the proportions of the picture. The sofa appeared significantly larger. I counted the heads. I recounted them, because I didn’t believe the number I came up with.\n\n*Thirty-four*.\n\nMy hands trembled. A bout of nausea growled in my stomach.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, a violent, searing pain exploded over the tips of my fingers where they were making contact with the polaroid. It felt similar to a burn, but that wasn’t exactly it. More like the stinging sensation of putting an ungloved hand into a mound of snow.\n\nThe polaroid fell out of my grasp. As it drifted towards the floor, I heard something coming from the hallway that led to the house’s back door. A distant melody that I had only heard once before last night, and yet I knew it by heart.\n\n*“But she will come from India with a love in her eyes*  \n*That say, ‘Oh, how my dark star will rise,’*  \n*Oh, how my dark star, oh, how my dark star*  \n*Oh, how my dark star will rise.”*\n\nTerror left me frozen. I listened without moving an inch. By the time it ended, I was drenched with sweat, my skin coated in a layer of icy brine.\n\nAfter a brief pause, the song just started over again.\n\nMy head became filled with visions. A group of teenagers right outside the backdoor, maybe the same ones who had broken in last night, playing the song and laughing under their breaths. Maybe the cop was there too, having been in on the entire scheme. Perhaps Blair hired them to harass me. The custody hearing was only weeks away. The more unstable I was, the more likely she’d get full custody of Thomas.\n\nThey were all out to prove I was a pathetic, wasted mess.\n\nOf course, that was all paranoid nonsense, and none of that accounted for the polaroid.\n\nI stomped around the couch, past the other furniture, down the narrow hallway, and wildly swung the door open.\n\n\\*“\\****Who, THE FUCK, are…”***\n\nMy scream quickly collapsed. I stood on the edge of the first of three rickety steps that led into the backyard, scanning for the source of the song.\n\nA few birds cawed and rustled in the pine trees that circled the house’s perimeter, no doubt startled by my tantrum. Otherwise, nature was still, and no one was there.\n\nMy fury dissipated. Logic found its way back to me.\n\nWhy was I expecting anyone to be there? The nearest house was a half-mile away. Blair wouldn’t hire anyone to torment me in such an astoundingly peculiar way, either. One, she wasn’t creative enough, and two, she wasn’t truly malicious. My former affluence was the foundation of our marriage. I knew that ahead of time. Once it was gone, of course she wanted out.\n\nBefore I could spiral into the black pits of self-loathing, a familiar hideaway, my ears perked.\n\nThe song was still playing. It sounded closer now.\n\nBut it wasn’t coming from outside the house like I’d thought.\n\n\\- - - - -\n\n*Laundry room, bathroom, guest room. Laundry room, bathroom, guest room…*\n\nNo matter how much I racked my brain, nothing was coming to mind.\n\nYou see, there were three rooms that split off from the hallway that led to the backyard. From the perspective of the backdoor, the laundry room and the bathroom were on the left, and the guest room was on the right, directly across the laundry room.\n\n*Maybe I’m just forgetting the layout. I haven’t been here that long, after all.*\n\nI remembered there being three rooms, but I was looking at four doors, and the muffled sounds of *”My Dark Star”* were coming from the room I couldn’t remember.\n\nMy palm lingered on the doorknob. Despite multiple commands, my hand wouldn’t obey. I couldn’t overcome my fear. Eventually, though, I found a mantra that did the trick. Three little words that have bedeviled humanity since its inception: a universal fuel, having ignited the smallest of brutalities to the most pervasive, wide-reaching atrocities over our shared history.\n\n*Be a man.*\n\n*Be a man.*\n\n***Be a man.***\n\nMy hand twisted, and I pushed the door open.\n\nThe room was tiny, no more than two hundred square feet by my estimation. Barren, too. There was nothing inside except flaking yellow wallpaper and the unmistakable odor of mold, damp and earthy.\n\nBut I could still hear *My Dark Star*, clearer than ever before. The sound was rough and crackling, like it was being played from vinyl that was littered with innumerable scratches.\n\nI tiptoed inside.\n\nIt was difficult to pinpoint *precisely* where the song was coming from. So, I put an ear to each wall and listened.\n\nWhen I placed my head on the wall farthest from the door, I knew I was getting close. The tone was sharper. The lyrics were crisp and punctuated. I could practically feel the plaster vibrate along with the bass.\n\nI stepped back to fully examine the wall, trying to and failing to comprehend the phenomena. There was barely any hollow space behind it. Not enough to fit a sound system or a record player, that's for certain. If I took a sledgehammer to the plaster, I would just create a hole looking out into the backyard.\n\nI stared at the decaying wallpaper, dumbfounded. I dragged my eyes over the crumbling surface, again and again, but no epiphany came. All the while, the song kept looping.\n\nOn what must have been the twentieth re-examination, my gaze finally hooked into something new. There was a faint sliver of darkness that ran the length of the wall, from ceiling to floor, next to the corner of the room.\n\nA crack of sorts.\n\nI cautiously walked towards it. Every step closer seemed to make the crack expand. Once my eyes were nearly touching it, the crevice had stretched from the width of a sheet of paper to that of a shot glass.\n\nSomehow, I wasn’t fearful. My time in that false room had a dream-like quality to it. Surreal to the point where it disarmed me. Like it all wasn’t real, so I could wake up at any moment, safe and sound.\n\nThe edges of the fissure rippled, vibrating like a plucked guitar string. Soon after, I felt light tapping on the top of my boots. I tilted my head down.\n\nEssentially, the wall coughed up a dozen more polaroids. They settled harmlessly at my feet.\n\nThe ones that landed picture-up were nearly identical to one I discovered in the living room, with small exceptions. Less scratched-out people, a different couch, more stars visible through the windows in the background, to name a few examples. The overturned polaroids had dates written on them in red sharpie, the earliest of which being September of 1996.\n\nWhen I shifted my head back to the crevice, it found it had expanded further. I stared into the black maw as *My Dark Star* faded out once again, and I could see something.\n\nThere were hundreds of polaroids wedged deeper within the wall, and the gap had grown nearly big enough for me to fit my head through.\n\nLong-belated panic stampeded over my skin, each nerve buzzing with savage thunder.\n\nI turned and bolted, flinging the door shut behind me.\n\nRacing through the narrow hallway, I peered over my shoulder, concerned that I was being chased.\n\nNothing was in pursuit, but there had been a change.\n\nNow, there were only three total doors:\n\nLaundry room, bathroom, guest room.\n\n\\- - - - -\n\nI have a hard time recalling the following handful of hours. It’s all a haze. I know I considered leaving. I remember sobbing. I very much remember drinking. I tried to call Blair, but when I heard Thomas’s voice pick up the line, I immediately hung up, mind-shatteringly embarrassed. I didn’t call the police, for obvious reasons.\n\nThe order in which that all happened remains a bit of a mystery to me, but, in the end, I suppose it doesn’t really matter.\n\nHere’s the bottom line:\n\nI drank enough to pass out.\n\nWhen the stupor abated and my eyes lurched open, I found myself on a sofa, propped upright.\n\nNot angled in the middle of the room where I had left mine, either.\n\nThis one had its back to the windows.\n\n\\- - - - -\n\nThe scene I awoke to was more perplexing than it was hellish.\n\nThe living room was absolutely saturated with objects I didn’t recognize - knickknacks, framed photos, watercolor paintings, ornamented mirrors. A citrusy aroma wafted through the air, floral but acidic. There were the sounds of lively chatter around me, but as I sat up and glanced around, I didn’t see anyone. Not a soul.\n\nI was about to stand up, but I heard the click of a record player needle connecting with vinyl. The sharp noise somehow rooted me to the fabric.\n\n*My Dark Star* began playing in the background.\n\nWhen I turned forward, there he was. Materialized from God knows where.\n\nHe appeared older than me by a decade or so, maybe in his late fifties. The man sported a cheap, ill-fitting blue checkered suit jacket with black chinos. His face held a warm smile and a pair of those New Year’s Eve novelty glasses, blue eyes peeking through the circles of the two number-nines in 1995.\n\nThe figure stared at me, lifted a finger to the corner of his mouth, and waited.\n\nI knew what he wanted. Without thinking, I obliged.\n\nI smiled too.\n\nHe nodded, brought a camera up to his eye, and snapped a polaroid.\n\nThe flash of light was blinding. For a few seconds, all I could see was white. Screams erupted around me, erasing the pleasant racket of a party. Then, I heard the roaring crackle of a fire.\n\nSlowly, my whiteout faded. The clamor of death quieted in tandem. My surroundings returned to normal, too. No more knickknacks or family photos: just a vacant, depressing, unrenovated home.\n\nThe man was also gone, but something replaced him. Like the scratched-out people, it was human-shaped, but it had much more definition. A seven-foot tall, thickly-built stick figure looming motionless in front of me. If there was a person under there, I couldn’t tell. If it had skin, I couldn’t see it.\n\nAll I could appreciate were the polaroids.\n\nThousands of nearly identical images seemed to form its body. They jutted out of the entity at chaotic-looking angles: reptilian scales that had become progressively overcrowded, each one now fighting to maintain a tenuous connection to the flesh hidden somewhere underneath.\n\nIt didn’t have fingers. Instead, the plastic squares formed a kind of rudimentary claw. Two-thirds down the arms, its upper extremities bifurcated into a pair of saucer-shaped, plate-sized digits.\n\nI watched as the right arm curved towards its belly. The motion was rigid and mechanical, and it was accompanied by the squeaking of plastic rubbing against plastic. It grasped a single picture at the tip of its claw. Assumably the one that had just been taken.\n\nThe one that included me.\n\nWhen it got close, a cluster of photographs on its torso began to rumble and shake. Seconds later, a long, black tongue slithered out between the cramped folds. The tongue writhed over the new picture, manically licking it until it was covered in gray-yellow saliva.\n\nThen, the tongue receded back into its abdomen, like an earthworm into the soil. Once it had vanished, the entity creaked its right arm at the elbow so it could reach its chest, pushing the polaroid against its sternum.\n\nThe claw pulled back, and it stuck.\n\nAnother for the collection.\n\nAn icy grip clamped down on my wrist.\n\nI turned my head. There was a scratched-out, colorless hand over mine.\n\nMy eyes traced the appendage up to its origin, but they didn’t need to. I already knew what I was about to see.\n\nThe sofa seemed to stretch on for miles.\n\nCountless scratched-out heads turned to face me, creating a wave down the line. Everyone wanted to see the newcomer, even the oldest shadows at the very, very end.\n\nI did not feel terror.\n\nI experienced a medley of distinct sensations, but none of them were negative.\n\nPeace. Comfort. Fufillment.\n\nSafety. Appreciation.\n\nLove.\n\nEver since the polaroid snapped, I’ve been smiling.\n\nI can't stop.\n\n\\- - - - -\n\nBlair, I hope you see this.\n\nThe door is fully open for me now, and I may not return.\n\nYou can have everything.\n\nThe house, the money, the cars.\n\nYou can keep Thomas, too.\n\nI don’t need you, I don’t need him, I don’t need any of it.\n\nI’ve found an unconditional love.\n\nI hope someday you find one, too.\n\nIf you ever need to find *me*, well,\n\nYou know where to go, but I’ll tell you *when* to go.\n\n11:58 PM, every night.\n\nIf you decide to come out here, bring Thomas.\n\nGregor would love to [meet him.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/unalloyedsainttrina\/)"},"82":{"title":"He can’t eat turkey anymore","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k8b5cm\/he_cant_eat_turkey_anymore\/","flair":null,"author":"AnceldaAce","selftext":"Have you ever seen a turkey that was as big as a human, or was it a human that was as small as a turkey? Oh wait, I remember now: it was a hybrid of a turkey and human. Quite frankly, I don’t know how that abomination could exist, but apparently it does; at least according to a young man by the name of Trent. Now Trent has volunteered his recounting of his encounter with what he calls “Turkey Man”. I’ll leave it to you to judge the veracity of his account. \n\nTrent recalled that night to me with some trepidation. He stated that he was camping out in the woods with some friends. They were playing airsoft against his friend’s older brother and friends. About a quarter mile separated the two camps. The middle ground was marked by a stick with some turkey feathers they found. The night was cold with a dry breeze that weaved between the trees. Trent and his team had secured a few victories in some skirmishes, but could not capture the enemy camp’s flag. He said from the afternoon until the evening he saw nothing out of the ordinary; just some teenagers having fun. Once the sun had set below the treetops, odd occurrences started. \n\nTrent had eaten a campfire meal alongside his friends when they heard something strange off in the distance. Trent’s friend Will dismissed the noises as his brother and friends, but Trent wasn’t so certain. The smell of smoke hung heavy as they waited for any sound, without so much as a cricket chirp. (According to Trent, the noise had come from a different direction of the other campsite). His unease was momentarily forgotten when Will teased him about his current crush. The camp returned to the normal noise of fire and chatting soon afterwards. \n\nWill was about to add some wood to the campfire when they heard the noise once more, closer this time. It was close enough to distinguish it as a turkey call (which sounds like a gobble). Will and Trent remarked that the turkey must have been what they heard earlier. Isaiah wasn’t so sure. He didn’t hunt so he thought it sounded a little off. The other two shrugged and went back to cracking jokes. This did little to assuage Isaiah of his worry, but he reluctantly joined them.\n\nSome time later once the chill had started to sink into each boy, Will said it was time for action; a midnight raid on the enemy camp.  This got Trent excited while Isaiah was more wary. Isaiah was sent to scout along the trail that connected the two camps. Trent headed to follow the dried creekbed that led near their camp to surprise the enemies with a flank. However, before they could make for their assigned missions a loud crash came from next to their camp. They jolted in surprise at the sudden sound that shattered the silence. What followed was a loud “gobbling” from where the crash occurred. The boys froze, their breath caught in anticipation. The “gobbling” echoed again growing louder—closer.\n\n“Wait, did just hear ‘gobble gobble?’” Trent\tasked in confusion.\n\n“Must have had too much ‘Root Beer’,” Will snorted.\n\nAs Trent was about to snap back, they heard something running, the rustling of feathers accompanied by dried leaves being crunched and twigs snapped underfoot.\n\n“What the hell?” Isaiah stammered.\n\n“After it,” Will shouted, “I think it's Lance or one of his friends! They stole the flag!”\n\nTrent ran after the noise and slipped down the bank of the creek.  He crouched on one knee to steady his airsoft gun. He flicked on the flashlight affixed to the barrel and scanned the creekbed. Their flag lay about twenty feet from where they had planted it.\n\n“It is them,” mumbled Trent. \n\nHe resumed his search, looking for the perpetrator of the failed theft. His flashlight beam came over something curled to the side of the creek bank. Trent strained his eyes to try and get a better look despite the dimming light from his flashlight.\n\n“Is that a turkey?” he wondered aloud.\nAt that moment the creature unfurled from its curled position. It stood upon two thin legs. It had a pot belly that was speckled with feathers and dark splotches. The short, oddly angled arms clung to the side of its feathered chest. A wattle hung low from its spindly neck (Trent was despondent at this point of his retelling and required several breaks to recount it fully). Its head froze Trent mid-breath. A sharp beak glistened where a mouth should’ve been. Feathers smothered its small rounded ears. Its eyes stared, irises like pinpricks. Looking into them Trent knew that it wasn’t one of God’s creations (his words). The beam of light dulled and started flickering as Trent was shocked still. The flashes caused the creature to let out not a “gobble” but scream. Trent vomited from the overwhelming sense of dread and disgust. As his body seized upon the ground in the fading light of consciousness he saw it flutter away deeper into the woods.\n\nTrent was pale and unresponsive to my prodding. I assisted him up, guiding him towards the door. He’d said all he could so I allowed him to leave. I do hope the medicine dulls his memory of that night.\n"},"83":{"title":"We Thought He Was Following Us","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k84qw4\/we_thought_he_was_following_us\/","flair":null,"author":"CheeseCrackersDEMO","selftext":"A few summers ago my friend Lexi (not her real name) and I went on a road trip down from Virginia, where we both live, to Florida. We had such a great time that we went again next year, but this time we went to New York. It was so much fun just hanging out with her on the road for days at a time that it was a no-brainer to head off once again this summer, and this time we planned to road trip to Dallas and then Phoenix.\n\nIt was the week after finals week and we were all packed and ready to go. Lexi had just gotten her full license over winter break so she was super excited to do some of the driving, which she did before anyway, but she was always so afraid of getting caught that it wasn’t ever for very long. I drove over to her house and helped her throw all her bags into the trunk and back seat of my dad’s old green and gray Subaru.\n\nSome of the bags were too big to fit in the trunk so we threw them in the back seat, a couple duffels covering the footwells behind our seats, which wouldn’t have been in the way of us reclining our seats to sleep on the nights we didn’t have a motel booked.\n\nWe had the whole trip planned out: everywhere we’d stop to eat, sleep, refill gas—by this point we were practically pros at road tripping. With everything prepared and settled, we set off around noon.\n\nThe route we had first went south, then cut through the middle of Alabama towards Dallas. We stopped for dinner in Birmingham, Alabama about eight hours into the trip. After that we were going to drive the last three hours to a city just across the border in Mississippi, but we completely lost track of time, staying at the diner in Birmingham for like two and a half hours.\n\nWhen we got back on the road the plan was still to try to make it to the city in Mississippi, but after only an hour I was afraid to squint too much at the other cars’ headlights and risk accidentally falling asleep. Lexi was also way too exhausted to drive and neither of us really loved the idea of stopping in some random town in the middle of Bumfuck Nowhere, Alabama, but we also didn’t love the idea of getting to Mississippi just a few hours before the sun rose and having to keep driving on less than five hours of sleep. So, Lexi took out her phone and I parked in the breakdown lane while she looked for nearby motels for us to stay at.\n\nThere weren’t many cars on the road so late at night. It was taking forever for the webpages to load on her phone so I turned the car off and we sat in the silence of us both being just desperate to find somewhere to sleep. After a while and a few grunts of frustration from Lexi, I was about to suggest we just find somewhere to park and sleep in the car when a pair of headlights pulled into the rear view mirror.\n\nAn old red truck, one with only the front seats, turned its hazards on and parked right behind us and I turned to Lexi expressing the same anxiety I was feeling. My hands were shaking a little when I went to put the keys in the ignition and we drove away before whoever pulled in behind us could talk to us.\n\nI pulled off the interstate at the next exit sign. We don’t even remember seeing a sign for the town’s name anywhere on the off-ramp, just a pitch black night besides our high beams and the trees and speed limit signs caught in front of them.\n\nThe first road off the highway was empty and full of potholes that were felt but unseen. Lexi pointed on the map on her phone to a public park where we could park and sleep for the night. After maybe twenty minutes of trying to navigate the roads of this town without GPS, passing horribly decrepit homes and commercial buildings with faded signs, we finally found the park and parked sideways in the lot. In the headlights we could make out a terribly run-down swing set, a slide, and a seesaw, all made of old, rotting wood. We made sure the doors were locked and spent the night in the car.\n\nLexi and I both woke up the next morning at about the same time, a quarter after seven. Sitting up, we both got a better look at the town we’d parked in. Across the street from the park there was an abandoned house. Its windows and doors boarded up and its front lawn was overgrown, up as high as the porch. Just next to it was a house with trash bags filling the front lawn all the way to the weed-infested sidewalk. Surrounding everything was a sparse hazy forest, and the rest of town was some ways behind us.\n\nI turned the car on and tried to blast cold air but all that came through was swelteringly hot. Desperate to get out of the heat and both starving, we fought the urge to leave that town as soon as possible and instead headed towards the center in hopes of finding somewhere to eat breakfast before we continued our trip.\n\nTraveling deeper into the town didn’t show us anything better than what we’d seen before. Flat, barren, and almost entirely deserted, this weird town only got weirder when we found an old diner. The sign in the window said it was open, so we gave it a shot.\n\nPulling into the parking lot, there were only two other vehicles parked, and one of them looked exactly like the red truck from the night before. Lexi pointed it out and suggested it might even be the same one, and that was weird, but we definitely didn’t feel it was weird enough to raise any red flags in our minds.\n\nStepping inside we were met with a room only marginally colder than outside and a blast of air from a standing fan right beside the door. The diner was more like a bar with a few wooden tables pushed up against the walls. A jukebox was up against the wall playing some 80s rock, but it was hardly loud enough to contend with the six box fans they had affixed to every window.\n\nSat in the corner of the diner there was a man, maybe in his 40s or 50s, staring down at a cup. His hair was almost unignorably greasy, glistening in the sunlight poking through the shredded blinds of the window beside him. The whole diner reeked of cat piss and I felt myself almost turning to leave when we were greeted by a woman on the other side of the bar. She asked what we wanted to drink and I turned to Lexi, kind of hoping she’d be the one brave enough to walk away. Instead, she shrugged and joined the woman at the bar, sitting up on one of the stools.\n\nThere were only two things listed on the menu for breakfast, and I hardly remember anything about what we ordered except that we both ate it very quickly and it all tasted stale. The man from before wasn’t sitting at the table anymore when we left the diner, and I remember noticing that the red truck wasn’t there anymore, either.\n\nWe hit the road and made it to Dallas a whole hour earlier than the route predicted and got a chance to do most of the things on our list. An uneasy feeling persisted in my stomach throughout the day which kind of ruined most of our destinations, but I tried my best not to drag Lexi down with me. I had no idea what was going on, there was just a horrible feeling that I was always being watched, but every time I looked around I either saw nobody or there were so many people that I couldn’t find whoever was watching me even if they existed.\n\nThen I finally saw him.\n\nWe had just arrived at Reunion Tower in the afternoon; it was when we stepped into the elevator. As the doors closed I saw him, the man from the diner, his eyes staring right back at me through his long black hair. My heart dropped and I felt sick, almost collapsing into Lexi. The weight of the paranoia I’d been feeling all day came crashing down at once and I could barely breathe enough to explain to her what I just saw.\n\nThe idea that this guy must’ve been following us all the way from Alabama seemed to click in both our heads at the same time. The other people in the elevator looked disgusted overhearing our conversation, all about as disturbed about the idea as Lexi and I were. A woman and her husband offered to walk with us back to our car and Lexi and I tried to decline, but they had already made up their minds about us so they went with us anyway. I’ll admit it, I felt a lot better in their company, especially since none of us saw the man again on our way back to the car. We thanked the couple and left as fast as we could out of Dallas, headed west towards Phoenix.\n\nThis second night we planned would take us out into the desert of New Mexico where we’d get a chance to see the Milky Way Galaxy and stargaze. It was around midnight that we reached the road we scouted on google maps. Lexi parked the car on a stretch of empty road and we stepped out into the quiet night, and the sky was beautifully clear. We soaked in the night sky for as long as we could before sleep started to overcome us and we got back in our car.\n\nAn hour passed and Lexi was fast asleep, but I just couldn’t sit still. I was tossing and turning and my heart was pounding with paranoia and a bad smell kept wafting past my nose and I really couldn’t manage to get any shut-eye. Eventually, exhausted, I sat up in my seat, lifting the back and staring out at the road.\n\nMy eyes darted all around the dark night horizon, looking for something to explain this feeling that has now followed me from Dallas, like someone is still watching me, like I’m not safe. My palms are getting clammy and I bite my lip, my gaze flickering up at the rear-view mirror where a set of headlights have appeared over the horizon. With my heart lurching in my stomach, I quickly stuck the keys in the ignition and hit the gas, desperate to escape this feeling and whoever is following us.\n\nWas that car following us? I didn’t know, I didn’t care. I had this awful feeling in my gut and I wasn’t going to just lie around and wait to find out why I was feeling it. Lexi jerked awake as I hit the gas, but didn’t have many questions when she saw the headlights behind us.\n\nWhen the maps finally loaded, I found the nearest motel, which was about a half hour away, but I wouldn’t have cared if it was four hours away. I didn’t feel safe sleeping in the car at all, and with that car already long gone behind us before I even reached the highway, I suppose I was just waiting for any excuse to get up and out of there.\n\nI triple checked that the door to our motel room was locked before collapsing onto the bed and passing out as soon as the adrenaline wore off. Lexi woke me up the following morning all distressed, pulling me out of bed and up to the window. Can you guess what was parked a few spaces away from our car? That exact same red truck from the interstate and the diner. I already started to feel a little less crazy for not taking any chances with those headlights the night before. Desperate for answers, we left our motel room to scope the red truck out.\n\nIt took every ounce of courage that we had to just approach the truck. We nervously peered inside. It was messy, full of fast food wrappers and soda cans and napkins and a pale grime was forming on the edges of the windows, probably from smoking. Importantly, however, the man from the diner wasn’t inside. Shaking, we checked out of the motel and hit the road, hoping that he might still be asleep in his room and won’t know where we’re going.\n\nI’m starting to get really paranoid now and Lexi is trying to calm me down and drive at the same time. I tell her we shouldn’t go to Phoenix anymore, thinking maybe this guy knows our plans, but she tells me that’s ridiculous. I remind her that he’s already followed us all the way from Alabama, but I can tell she’s starting to get really irritated. She doesn’t want to hear me suggest we turn back, and I could hardly blame her. I was also pretty angry at the idea that this trip would be ruined because some creep decided to ruin it, but I also didn’t want to end up in the newspaper. Regardless, she managed to soothe me enough to be on board with the idea of staying on track and finishing our road trip.\n\nWe crossed the state of New Mexico and ended in Phoenix, Arizona at around sunset. Even despite the tensions and stresses we both shared, I think that it would’ve been impossible for us to both sit in still silence for ten whole hours. Eventually, we started talking again and getting back into the good vibe that we were seeking in this road trip in the first place.\n\nWe started to joke about the creepy guy following us, saying we must be drop-dead gorgeous for someone to chase us across five states. Although each quip had an undertone of discomfort, we were trying really hard to move on and have a good time despite it all. In all the long stretches of empty desert freeway,we didn’t see that truck once, and in the way the panic died down as the day went on, we really were starting to enjoy ourselves once more.\n\nAt one point on the road we were starving. Hoping still to make it to Phoenix before the sun set—and also perhaps a bit afraid to stop driving in case that red truck catches back up with us—Lexi told me she had a box of granola bars in her bag in the back seat. I reached back and unzipped it, taking the open box out and bringing it into the front seat. Lexi paused with a weird look on her face and asked if I had opened the box, to which I said I hadn’t, and to which she said she must’ve opened it and forgotten, but with the look on her face it was clear that she didn’t really fully believe herself.\n\nThose kept us going until Phoenix, where we stopped at a McDonald’s and headed inside for a chance to stretch our legs. We ate fast and left to head to the motel and check in, but when we did we were told they were completely full. Lexi was starting to lose her mind as we drove around the city trying to find another motel within our price range that wasn’t completely occupied. When we eventually found one, we went inside to find one of the beds soaking wet for literally no reason. Full of exhausted anger, she stormed down to the clerk and practically screamed at him. He offered her a new room at no cost, but she just stormed out and back to the car, so I followed her.\n\nWe got into the hot car and she had a breakdown, sobbing into the steering wheel. I tried to console her but the truth was I was almost surprised I wasn’t crying right there with her. I was able to keep my composure and we switched seats, and I drove us out to find somewhere to sleep in the car for the night. We lied there in the car, the engine half-on and AC blasting freezing air to keep the interior habitable, and just grieved our ruined road trip, tried to make the plans up to think of another time this summer we might get a chance to give it another go. Eventually, she fell asleep basically mid-sentence and I tried to follow suit.\n\nThe street lamp a few yards behind the car dimly illuminated the roof of the car as I stared up at it. That terrible smell crept back into my nose, but it lingered instead of wafting past. It was like a mix of vinegar and sewage and I almost gagged, covering my nose and mouth with the shirt I’d taken off. My heart was still pounding in my chest, and that feeling came back. Here? A state and a half away from where we last saw that truck? No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn’t rest my mind once again. I groaned and rubbed my eyes vigorously, pulling the seat back upright. It hissed like a gasp as it pulled up and I paused, quietly turning towards the back seat. Lexi’s seat was reclined back over her bags that covered the footwell completely. Obscured it absolutely.\n\nTrembling, I shook Lexi awake. She opened her eyes and I silently hushed her. She sat up and I pointed at the bag just behind my seat. I turned the AC off and we both stared. The bag rose and fell with a hushed breath that wasn’t either of ours. Horror pulled at her eyelids. A scream climbed her throat but she bit her lip as her eyes started to water. Her nails clattered against the door handle as she panickedly threw the door open and leapt out of the car. I rushed out right after her, but before I closed the door, I pushed my seat back down and nearly tripped into the road as I stumbled out. Lexi was already pacing up towards the lamp and I threw my shirt back on as I rushed to the sidewalk at her side. She was hyperventilating and cursing and I took my phone out, barely able to dial for 911. It was just then that I started crying trying to explain what we both just thought we saw—a man was hiding in the back seat of our car.\n\nI threw up in my mouth and sat down to catch my breath. Lexi couldn’t stand still and couldn’t muster a single coherent sentence, just pacing and staring back at the car, waiting for the police to show up. A few cruisers showed up and the police called for the man in the back of our car to step out. When nothing happened, they opened the doors and paused, pulling him out onto the street to administer CPR.\n\nThe man had long, greasy black hair and laid strewn out lifelessly on the asphalt. They pronounced him dead at the scene, having suffocated under my reclined seat. Tucked away under our seats they found a small knife and some zip ties, and the thought of what he might’ve done had I allowed myself to fall asleep brought me to my knees, relieving sick on the sidewalk while Lexi tried to comfort me with her trembling hands.\n\nWe stayed in a hotel for a couple days while my dad drove over to pick us up. He had the Subaru towed back and Lexi and I both just went home. I don’t even know what to do with myself at this point, honestly. I know it isn’t my fault but I can’t help but feel horrible for not catching on sooner. I feel really stupid, I don’t know."},"84":{"title":"I encountered a Stranger while working at a desert Radio Station","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k7vi4j\/i_encountered_a_stranger_while_working_at_a\/","flair":null,"author":"SleepySniper45","selftext":"Back in my early twenties, I worked at a small radio station as the night time Radio host. The station itself was in a small town about an hour away from Las Vegas. “KRT3 87.4 FM” was our station name, not particularly noteworthy or catchy sounding, but our signal only really served the small towns surrounding one side of Vegas so it didn't need to stand out. Despite that fact, we had a small yet dedicated listener base and played mostly old Country songs. Some mornings when I'd go to the local diner for breakfast after my shift I'd talk with some of the old timers that liked to tune into my evening broadcast. They'd usually give me music suggestions or things to talk about for my next show. \n\nNeedless to say, it was a great gig and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The pay was okay, but it honestly wasn't a lot of work and it got me by while I figured out what I wanted to do with my life. With that being said, there was one incident at the station that made me quit for good, and to this day I still have zero idea as to what actually happened that night.\n\nFor context: our station was a small brick building about a 30 minute drive outside of a very small town. All together the total population had to have been somewhere around six hundred people, so the community was very tight knit. We were situated just off the “main highway” and it wasn't unusual to see a few cars pass each night, but you never really saw any people whatsoever. The land across from the station was bare desert for miles and miles, and the same could be said for the surrounding land as well with the exclusion of a few small mountain\/foothill ranges and a Native American reservation approximately 80 miles north of the station.\n\nNow with the scene set, let me share with you one of the most horrifying nights I've had in my life.\n\nIt was late August, probably around 6pm. I was an hour into my shift and my co-worker, who was the daytime host, had stayed a bit later with me so we could do a segment\/debate about the local Mayoral election coming up. Super boring stuff, but our average listener base consisted of old farmers and ranchers who ate up local politics. We finished up and I segwayed into the first music block I had carved out for the night, allowing my co-worker to gather his things and get ready to go home.\n\n“Alright, I've got my keys… got my bag… should be everything” my co-worker mumbled to himself. “Oh and are you still okay to come in an hour and a half earlier tomorrow to cover me? I'm sorry to do it to you but my Dog cannot miss her appointment at the vet. She's getting old y'know”.\n\nI never was able to sleep well anyways, and the little bit of overtime would help with some bills, so I had readily agreed.\n\n“Yeah man of course, don't worry about it. I'll be here for 3:30 PM sharp. Just don't forget, you owe me one!” I jokingly jabbed back at him\n\n“Yes yes I know I won't forget… anyways I gotta run, see you tomorrow dude” my co-worker replied back as he clumsily stumbled his way out the door towards his car\n\nWith a slam of the door and a turn of the key, him and his car motored off back into town leaving just me at the station. I had about 50 minutes left of the uninterrupted music block I started, so I decided to break out one of the books I had in my desk and then head to our small kitchen to put a pot of coffee on. \n\nI managed to get about 3 chapters of “Death Is A Lonely Business” and 2 cups of coffee down before it was time to interject with my weather update for the day\n\n“It's another lovely evening here in *town name* with temperatures sitting around 91°F as the sun is setting. Nothing but clear skies on the radar so get out there and do some stargazing tonight! Anyways, coming up next we have another solid hour of nothing but solid gold country hits, starting off with a great one from Hank Williams… this one's for you Ray!”\n\nRay was one of the old timers I talked to at the diner often. He had requested a certain album that morning so of course I had to dig through all our vinyls to see if we had it, which we did. As I dropped the needle onto the groove, I was startled by a sharp succession of knocks at the station door \n\nIt caught me off guard as nobody really ever shows up at the station unless it's someone in dire need of help, or maybe my co-worker turning around because he forgot something. I recalled an incident the year prior where a stranded motorist had shown up at the station at night seeking help and thought maybe this was the case again. I got up as my next block of music started, and went to peer through the peephole of the door to see who was there.\n\nThere was a guy on the other side of the door, probably in his late teens or early twenties. Slim build, average height, possibly Native American or Latino with dark black hair, dark brown eyes and was wearing a tan plaid shirt with a pair of dirty jeans and well worn cowboy boots. I decided to open the door to greet him and truly caught sight of just how bad he looked. He was disheveled and looked exhausted with his eyes sunken back into his skull and beads of sweat pouring from his face. \n\n“Hey man are you alright? Do you need something?” I asked him\n\nHe looked back at me for what felt like almost entirely too long before replying in a low, almost hushed voice: “My car broke down.. you got a phone?”\n\nThe station did indeed have a landline, so I brought him inside and led him to the phone\n\n“There's a directory book hanging on the wall beside the phone. Town's not too far from here and I believe the service station offers towing services. Why don't you give them a call and I'll grab you some water man, you don't look too good..”  I told the man as I went to the kitchen to get some water, and simultaneously make a fresh pot of coffee \n\nHe nodded but didn't say a word \n\nI returned down the hallway with a glass of water and found him sitting at my co-workers desk. His back was to me, sitting absolutely pin straight in the chair with his arms resting on the chair’s. \n\n“Here's that water man, were you able to get ahold of the folks at the service station?” I asked as I set the water down on the desk in front of him. I received no reply to my question. Instead he kept his gaze focused out the window beside the front door. \n\nI went and sat in my chair across from him. Yet again he remained silent, but picked up the water and drank it all down in one continuous motion before sitting the glass back down on the desk.\n\nI found his lack of any real conversation a bit strange, but then again I had no idea how long dude had been out there exposed to the elements. It could get up to 110°F during the day and that kind of heat can kill you if you're not prepared. I thought he's probably just severely dehydrated and beyond exhausted.\n\n“How far away did your car break down?” I asked.\n\nHe stared at me for what felt like an uncomfortably long time before raising his finger towards the East and saying again in a hushed tone “About five miles”.\n\nHe looked like he had walked about five hundred miles to get here, not just five. So I was a bit confused on how he looked as disheveled as he was. Nonetheless I wasn't here to judge.\n\n“Hey that ain't too bad, at least it wasn't 100 miles away. Kinda lucky you were close to here. Well just sit tight for a bit I'm sure the tow truck will be along within the next hour or two. I've got coffee brewing right now if you want some”.\n\nAgain he didn't utter a word and just turned his head to stare out the window. The sun was starting to go down, casting a deep Orange glow onto his face. I took it as a silent acknowledgement and jumped back into my reading for a bit, neither of us moving from our positions for the next 30 minutes, and nobody uttering a single word in that time. \n\nChecking my watch I saw I had about 10 minutes before introducing the next music block so I got up to get more coffee. The guy was still staring out the window as I passed by. I'm not even sure if he blinked once in the time we spent sitting there, he just kept his head to the side staring out the window. Grabbing two mugs I poured us both some coffee, but being the klutz I am I managed to spill mine. I spent a few minutes cleaning everything up before heading back out to my desk with mugs in hand. \n\nMy coworkers's chair was empty. I sat the one mug I poured for the stranger down on the desk and looked around for him. Walking briefly to the hallway I noticed the bathroom door shut and figured he was probably in there. I was a bit confused as I never heard anyone stand up and walk down the hall, but didn't really give it a second thought. \n\nI set my coffee down at my desk, dropped into my chair and popped my headphones on just in time to interject my commentary before the next hour of music. \n\n“KRT-3 with yet another hour of uninterrupted music coming up next starting off with a great album from The Charlie Daniels Band! But before that I'd just like to say even though we are heading into fall make sure you and your vehicle are prepared to face the heat of the desert if you're headed out. It's better to be over prepared rather than under prepared!” \n\nSwapping out the last vinyl for the next while I gave my spiel, I put the needle down just as I finished my last sentence. Taking off my headphones I picked up my book yet again and began reading, totally forgetting about the stranger who was still in the bathroom. It wasn't until 45 minutes later after I finished my 3rd coffee and really needed to piss did I remember he was still in there. I half-rushed down the hall and went to knock on the door with a “Hey sorry man but…” when the door pushed open as soon as my hand met it.\n\nThe bathroom was empty. The stranger was gone. Now, there were no windows in the bathroom. If you were to leave you'd have to walk out of the bathroom, straight down the hall and then turn Left right past my desk to go out the front door. So if he left it at any point he would have walked right past me as I was sat there reading. \n\nOf course I was beyond puzzled at this, but I did still really have to pee… so I did my business. I washed up and came to the conclusion that maybe I was just mistaken. Maybe the tow truck had gotten here early and he left and I mistakenly thought he was in the bathroom. It still didn't explain though how I never heard anyone leave though.\n\nUpon drying my hands off I walked back out to my desk and then stopped dead in my tracks when I rounded the corner. There at my co-worker’s desk was the stranger. Sitting in exactly the same way, still facing out the window, as if he had never moved from the chair.\n\nI was very weirded out, but I like to consider myself a rational and level-headed person and reasoned with myself that there had to be some sort of explanation for where this guy went, so I asked him:\n\n“Hey.. man.. I thought you left. Where did you go? Did the tow truck come by yet?”\n\nNothing. Not a word from this guy.\n\nAt this point I was just wondering what the hell his problem is. I didn't want to come off as bigoted but I thought that maybe he just didn't speak English very well? I mean he didn't seem like a threat, he was just… really fucking weird I don't know. The kind of vibes I was getting from him were indescribable. \n\n“Maybe he just went outside for some fresh air or something. It's pretty stuffy in here anyways. Not a big deal” I thought to myself\n\nI was feeling a bit tired from not sleeping particularly well the previous day and just chalked things up to my brain jumping at shadows. I decided that another cup of coffee might be a good idea to regain some brain power. I grabbed my mug and noticed the stranger's mug was also empty\n\n“I'm grabbing some more coffee, you want some?” I asked\n\n“Yes”\n\nThe reply came almost instantly, in a deeper voice this time. A stark contrast to the hushed tone he had used earlier, but I welcomed it seeing as how he hadn't spoken a word to me since he initially showed up. With both mugs in hand I went back to the kitchen. I emptied out the old grounds and filter and replenished the water before loading the machine with more coffee grounds. I decided to make a full fresh pot seeing as how I'm tired and obviously the stranger likes the coffee, even if he didn't say much to me. Upon flipping the switch to start the brewing process, I turned and headed back to my desk as it would soon be time for my next commentary and the next album. \n\nHe was gone. Again. \n\nNow I know for a fact this time I didn't hear anybody get up and move around. No footsteps, no noises, no opening and closing of doors. Nothing. Yet he just disappeared.\n\nI checked the bathroom, the door was wide open and empty. Nobody was in the studio at the desk, nobody was under the desk, hell I even checked IN the desk for some reason. Nothing. Nobody was in the kitchen, and nobody was in the storage room. That's the entire studio, and this stranger had just vanished. \n\nI walked back over to my desk and slumped into my chair feeling half fearful and half bewildered. My mind was now going in circles trying to figure out what the hell was going on here. I must have sat there going back and forth over possible scenarios for a good five minutes before I realized the record I had playing ended and it was time for commentary again\n\nStill shaken I picked up my headphones and tried to think of something to say\n\n“KRT-3 here… we may be uh.. having a few technical issues here tonight, so I do apologize to any of our late night listeners. To make up for it I have a special record up next. From one of my personal favorite artists, here's Waylon Jennings-”\n\nAs I changed out the vinyl I was again startled by a sharp succession of knocks at the front door, just as I dropped the needle.\nI scooted back with my chair and dropped my headphones on the desk, sitting and listening. We kept a .22 Caliber rifle nearby in the storage room just in case (it was a small town in the desert with lots of farms and ranches around, not uncommon for most people to own firearms) and without thinking I made my way over to grab it \n\nWith rifle in hand, I grabbed a few bullets from the box of ammunition stored next to it and made my way to the front door. If this was the stranger out there at this point I didn't care. Now I was looking out for myself.\n\nI peered out the peep hole in the door and scanned what little of the surrounding area I could see. It took my eye a bit to adjust, but I could just barely make out a figure standing back away from the door. I could not tell who it was though. Since the blinds on the window were still open, I carefully shuffled over to my left and leaned my head over to see out of it. \n\nAt this point it was fairly dark and I couldn't see all too well with the faint glow cast by the two outside lights mounted on either side of the front door. But I could make out someone standing there, approximately 20 feet from the door. It shared the same height as the stranger but I couldn't make out any discernible details. I strained my eyes to look a little harder when a giant thud hit the door. \n\nThe sound was so violent and so unexpected that I screamed and fell back onto the floor. Still clutching the rifle, I brought it to my chest with one hand and used the other to slide myself backwards; pushing wildly with my legs until I was up against the wall.  Though my hands were shaking hard I raised the rifle to the door and shouted.\n\n“I have a gun! I don't know who the hell you are but you need to leave before I start shooting”.\n\nMy warning however went unheeded, and the door shook again with a crashing thud. I kept my composure as best as I could and kept the rifle trained on the door, ready to start letting off rounds. \n\nTHUD…. THUD…. THUD\n\nIt repeated about every 20 seconds\n\nAfter I don't even know how many times the front door was hit, my adrenaline hit a peak and I squeezed the trigger. A single shot rang out and pierced though the door around chest level. I quickly cycled the bolt and let off another round, hitting the door again not far from where the first round hit.\n\nThen there was silence. \n\nAs the ringing in my ears lessened and my heavy breathing slowed a bit, I stood myself up and kept the rifle trained at the door, cycling the bolt for a new round just in case. I didn't want to chance opening the door and getting jumped by something or someone in case I missed, so I slowly worked my way over to the window where I could see if anything was sprawled out on the ground.\n\nWhen I was finally able to get a clear line of sight outside I was horrified to see absolutely nothing. No person, no animal, nothing. My blood had run completely ice cold at this point. My rational brain had all but completely shut down and I was now entirely submerged in fight or flight.\n\n*THUD* \n\nThe crashing noise started up again but this time from the opposite side of the building. Like I mentioned earlier, the station was a brick building. The only possible way a noise of that magnitude would be possible is if you took a pickup truck and hit the wall with it going AT LEAST twenty miles an hour.\n\n*THUD*\n\nSomething hit again from the roof this time \n\n*THUD* \n\nAgain the front door shook. At this point I was turning in circles trying to decide where to point the gun next. It was like I was being surrounded, and boy if I wasn't severely outnumbered. I slung the rifle on my back and made a quick dash down the hall to the storage room, turning and slamming the door once inside. Thankfully this being a storage room there were some decently heavy file cabinets along the wall. I managed to slide one in front of the door to block it off before turning and slumping myself down against the opposite wall, grabbing and pointing the rifle at the door at the same time. \n\nThe loud thudding continued for some time before blending into what sounded like a symphony of fists knocking on every inch of the building. I was beyond frightened. I was trapped in this small room, and though I did have something to protect myself with I didn't even know what I was up against. I had never experienced anything even remotely close to this in my life.\n\nI sat there with the rifle and listened as the symphony of knocks dwindled to just a single knock at the front door, before stopping all together. Obviously I didn't trust that whatever was out there was gone for good, so I waited about an hour (according to my watch) before even thinking of leaving the confines of the storage room. \n\nPushing myself up off the laminate floor all my muscles ached and my body felt heavy. Once my fight or flight wore off I just went back to being completely exhausted. No amount of Caffeine could help me now. But I knew that I still had to keep my wits about me and stay vigilant. Even though I had only fired the gun twice, I grabbed another handful of bullets from the box and shoved them into my pocket with the others. Better safe than sorry is a great principle to live by. \n\nI stood in front of the door and took a couple deep breaths to steel myself. \n\n“I just need to get to the phone. I can call the Sheriff and get them to send everything they've got. It'll only take a minute. I can do this”\n\nWith those thoughts in mind I pushed aside the filing cabinet and readied my weapon. One… two… three.. I threw open the door and brought the rifle up to both my hands immediately. I could see across to the bathroom, it was empty. Slowly working my way out, I peered Right towards the front door, and then Left to the kitchen area. Everything was as it should be. Nothing in disarray, the chair to my co-workers desk was pushed in neatly. The kitchen still faintly smelled of coffee, but there was this weird heavy scent that hung thick in the air through the whole station.\n\nI hadn't noticed until after leaving the storage room. This might show my true age but eh whatever, it's the best way I can describe it; have you ever rolled your spare change into those wrappers so you can take them to the bank? After handling all those old Pennies and Quarters and what not, your hands get this very distinct earthy\/coppery\/metallic smell to them. That is precisely what it smelled like in there. \n\nThe coppery smell, the eerie silence only broken by the sound of the vinyl player’s needle skipping over the record I had put on last. The whole situation was fucked up like I was on the set of some horror movie. But unlike those movies with their (quite frankly) brain-dead protagonists, I only had one mission in mind; and that was to pick up the phone and call the Sheriff. So I did.\n\nAfter assuring myself the place was indeed empty, I slung the rifle back over my shoulder and made my way into the kitchen. I grabbed the phone off its receiver and started wildly punching in the number for the Sheriff's office. A small sense of relief was starting to wash over me as the dial tone started to sound.\n\nBut that sense of relief did not last long at all. Over the eerie quiet that had befallen the station; over the dial tone of the phone, and the skipping of the record player, there was another noise. The sound of the front door’s hinges ever so slowly opening. Through everything that had transpired that night, not once did it cross my mind to even lock the front door, and in that moment I had felt fear like I'd never felt it before. My heartbeat which I could feel thumping so prominently within my chest through everything had increased by so much I could no longer feel it, and I'm sure my face must have been whiter than a fresh snowfall. \n\nI forgot all about the phone in my hand. I dropped it. I had zero grip strength left in me. Turning slowly around to face the front door, I saw the stranger was back. He stood back faced towards me in the open doorway, arms at his sides, unmoving. The sound of the dial tone went quiet. The skipping of the record player however, kept a steady rhythm. The only thing that pierced the silence were the words the stranger spoke:\n\n“I. Need. Help” \n\nNow about here is where things get foggy for me. After those events, the very next thing I remember is the deep Orange glow of the morning sun beaming on my face, and a firm hand on my shoulder.\n\n“Dude, what the fuck are you doing out here? Are you okay are you hurt?? What's going on?” \n\nIt was my co-worker. Apparently when he rolled up to the station for work that morning, he saw something out in the open desert across from the building. My co-worker wore glasses and all around just genuinely had terrible vision, so he kind of just brushed it off because he couldn't make out any discernible details. But after walking up to the now closed front door of the station and noticing two perfect bullet holes right through it, he became intrigued and quickly went inside. \n\nI was gone. There was a cold cup of coffee on my desk, and the needle on the last vinyl I played was sitting off of the record, as if someone had taken the time to stop it from repeatedly skipping. He called out for me and checked every room of the station, becoming increasingly concerned when he could find no trace of me anywhere, and found the rifle missing from the storage room. \n\nHe returned outside and walked to the road when he noticed the figure in the desert had moved closer, just barely being able to discern it's features now as a human. He started to walk towards it, forming into a sprint once he got close enough to notice it was in fact me standing out there. \n\nAnd that is where I woke up. I was standing in the middle of the desert, arms laid at my side, back pin straight, just staring out at the horizon.\n\nMy co-worker brought me back to the radio station and phoned the Sheriff, telling him the state he found me in and about the bullet holes in the door. Apparently the Sheriff's station did get a call that night, but the Operator hung up as there was nobody on the other end of the phone. I couldn't even speak for myself at this point, it was as if my mind had just completely broken leaving me as a living, breathing, shell of a human. Eventually the Sheriff and a couple deputies did turn up as well as an ambulance. Everyone tried to ask me questions about that night and I knew I couldn't tell anyone what I witnessed. They would have just labelled me as crazy and locked me away in an institution or some shit. \n\nSo with what little grip of my sanity I could muster I spun them a short tale about some crazed drifter that tried to assault me that night. Obviously they were a bit dubious about my story, as there was no blood from any of the shots I fired, and no sign that anyone else had been there with me that night. Hell I learned later on apparently there wasn't even a second coffee mug found, just the one that I used. But as they had no other evidence to go off of, that is the official explanation for what happened to me according to the law. \n\nI stayed in the local hospital for a couple days so they could monitor me. The first day they loaded me up with Ativan as I was still in somewhat of a state of shock and couldn't function. But ultimately I was released a few days later with a clean bill of health. \n\nI did briefly get a chance to speak with some of the locals I usually conversed with at the diner after the incident. They asked me how I was and I reassured them that I would be fine. Ray, who was the one that specifically requested that Hank Williams album, would have been up late listening to my broadcast that night, so I asked him if anything seemed off about it or if he noticed the Dead Air after I stopped playing music.\n\nHe told me he stayed up a bit later after the music I played for him as he was working on installing some new parts for his farm truck that night, but that he didn't notice anything unusual. Nobody else I knew caught my broadcast after about 8pm. \n\nI still don't exactly have an explanation for what happened that night. I remember years later learning about Wendigos and Skinwalkers and all the cryptids of the desert, and the coppery Blood smell usually associated with the first two entities, but ultimately I just don't know. I ended up moving to Canada a couple years later and no longer have contact with anyone back home. Most of my family is dead and I really just don't have a reason to go back there. \n\nEver since I left I haven't experienced anything like that in my life ever again. \nSome days I still wonder if the old radio station is still standing, and if anyone else has seen the Stranger. But as far as I know I'm the only one to come across him. That night left me with a giant mental scar I'll never truly be able to forget. \n\nIf anyone has any ideas on what I might have come across that night I would love to hear some suggestions, as I really don't have the faintest clue.

My body hurt, though as I flexed each limb, I didn’t think anything was broken. The wet clothes I wore didn’t care for the frigid conditions, and my teeth began to chatter as a light snowfall tumbled around my face. It was still dark, but the sky overhead was a mass of puffy white, snow-laden clouds that rolled by on their endless march through the atmosphere. Some of the wind had died down, but instead of a surrounding canopy of towering pines or swamp grass, I found myself stretched out in a rolling field pockmarked by scrub brush, bedded down with the winter’s snow. All in all, I would have some nasty bruises and could feel the places where I had cuts of lacerations, but still, I was alive.\n\nBreathing a sigh of relief as I blinked to clear my head, I tasted the fresh air with weary delight.\n\n*Barron County. Never thought I’d be so happy to see you again. Did you miss me?*\n\nTwo faces materialized in my plane of vision, and a familiar grin made my heart start working.\n\n“W-We’ve got to s-stop meeting like t-this.” I shivered, my throat dry, but smiled as Chris pulled me into his arms.\n\n“Old habits die hard.” He dragged me out of the snowdrift with ease, his voice hoarse as Chris shook with the cold. “You okay?”\n\nI winced as the soreness in my battered muscles returned. “Ask me in the morning.”\n\n“I told you she’d be fine.” Jamie tucked a woolen army surplus blanket around my shoulders, but from her pale, blood-spattered face, I could tell she was as relieved as he was. “Come on, let’s get her to the fire. Temperature’s still dropping, and we’ve come too far to die from hypothermia now.”\n\nHauled to my feet, I put both arms around their shoulders and walked through the snow towards a distant line of trucks. Now that I was awake, I could see our forces scattered over the wide field, many like myself waking up in the snow, dazed. Few of our original vehicles had survived; most of the wreckage lay strewn about the field, like oversized children’s toys that had been discarded. The circle of vehicles in the center I recognized to be our support column, a secondary group tasked with meeting us after our mission had concluded. Two gray chinook helicopters squatted inside the long cordon, and teams of stretcher bearers rushed out to scoop more men from the snow. Over half of our number lay wounded, some limping or crawling toward their comrades, others too broken to make the trip, their cries haunting and pitiful. Many dead bodies carpeted the field, all of them ours, as if the passage back into our world had whisked away the casualties from Vecitorak’s defeated army. Tauerpin Road, and all its strange landmarks, was nowhere to be seen. The concrete tower was gone, the gravel road with it, and instead of the perpetual rain of an October night, we had returned to the wintry present, where the early December skies dropped buckets of snowflakes on our heads.\n\nInside the circle of idling trucks, medics tended to the lines of wounded on the ground next to several small piles of brush that had been set ablaze by the soldiers to provide warmth to the sodden task force. The vehicles were already packed with men, their heaters on full blast, and the NCO’s did their best to make sure the worst off got priority in that luxury. The rest of us huddled around the fires, while various squad leaders called out names as they searched for missing people.\n\nChris wedged me into the nearest circle so I could warm myself by a fire lit inside an old, rusted oil drum someone had found, and one of the survivors to my right peered at me through a mass of blood-stained gauze.\n\n“Didn’t think we’d be seeing you again, lass.” The bundled-up man croaked, and my jaw dropped.\n\n*No way.*\n\nStunned, I took in the sight of Peter’s haggard face, the left side covered with a large bandage over his eye, more cotton pressed down over a gouge that ran from forehead to cheekbone in a bloody trench. He’d taken a sword cut right to the face, and I doubted there remained much of an eyeball under that bandage, judging by the sheer amount of blood smeared over his skin. In his arms, Peter held Tarren, her face buried in his long coat, dirty hands balled up in his shirtfront.\n\n“I could say the same to you.” Relieved, I matched his ornery grin but nodded at the girl in his lap. “Is she okay?”\n\n“Physically, yeah.” His smile faded, and Peter scowled at the nearby bonfire, tugging the woolen blanket closer around Tarren’s little shoulders. “Hasn’t said anything in the last half-hour. Not sure if or when that will change.”\n\nThat made my heart twinge, and I watched Tarren stay curled up in his arms, refusing to look around, only her slight breathing giving indication she was alive. “What about you?”\n\nPeter continued watching the flames for a moment, then glanced at me with his one good eye. “You seen Grapeshot?”\n\n“Once.” I winced and squinted down at my dirty fingernails for a distraction. “It wasn’t for very long.”\n\nHe waited until I brought my gaze back up, and Peter’s face took on a serious contour. “He’s dead?”\n\nUnable to think of anything else to say, I nodded. Despite everything he’d done, all his sins, Captain Grapeshot had saved my life, gave me the time I needed to bring the Oak Walker down, and I knew it was a debt I could never repay. His face would forever be etched into my memory, his final words, the way his lifeless body had flown off the tower on the heels of the grenade.\n\n*Another life paid in exchange for mine.*\n\n“Good.”\n\nShocked at his words, I gaped at the boy’s calm expression in the firelight. “Peter . . .”\n\n“He was my brother.” Craning his head back to look up at the snow-laden clouds, Peter let out a long sigh. “Maybe we shared no blood, aye, but we were brothers all the same. I watched him suffer, every day, until he stopped being himself and turned into someone I didn’t recognize. Whatever pain he was in, he won’t feel it anymore, and that’s for the best.”\n\nI grimaced in sympathy at the sadness in his voice and angled my head at Tarren. “He gave his life to save her.”\n\nHis dark eyes moistened, and Peter gripped a silver rapier under his opposite arm, one that I remembered from my time spent on the *Harper’s Vengeance*. “Then he died as himself.”\n\nA team of medics slogged by, carrying another litter, and one of the trucks opened so a mercenary could call out to his comrades.\n\n“I need more plasma here!” He waved to the other medics, his blue rubber gloves awash in crimson. “BP’s dropping fast. Tell Primarch either we get those birds in the air, or someone better get a nine-line going, ASAP!”\n\nPeter’s mouth formed into a grim line, and he pointed to the vehicle, keeping his voice low so the words stayed between us. “The preacher’s not doing so well. They’ve had him in there for the past fifteen minutes, working on his legs. Even the flower juice the golden-hairs use didn’t bring him around.”\n\n*Last time I saw him, he was crawling for his sword, through fire and ash.*\n\nAt that, my heart sank, and I swallowed a lump in my throat as more ELSAR soldiers rushed to bring medical supplies to the truck in question. Adam had stood toe-to-toe with Vecitorak, crossed blades with an immortal being on par with the demons of ancient lore, and paid the price for it. Even his armor hadn’t protected the man from the mutant’s wrath, and in my head, I saw again Eve’s tear-streaked face as she bid him goodbye on the tarmac in Black Oak.\n\n*Crunch, crunch, crunch.*\n\nBoots trudged through the snow behind me, and I turned to see another figure push through the crowd.\n\n“You alright, Captain?” Colonel Riken looked me over with the stern ease of a man who’s seen too much to be rattled by the insane circumstances we found ourselves in. He’d lost his helmet at some point and sported a bandage around his left hand, but other than that, the ELSAR commander seemed okay. His uniform was as gory and ragged as everyone else’s, the light machine gun at his side caked with gray carbon deposits around the muzzle. A long tear, likely from a claw, had ripped through his plate carrier, the armor underneath all that stood between Colonel Riken and what would have been certain death.\n\nUnder the assault of another icy blast of wind, I shuddered but did my best to speak between chattering teeth. “I-I’m fine. How m-many did we lose?”\n\nColonel Riken shrugged the soot-covered weapon higher on his shoulder. “A third, by my count. But whatever you did, it worked. Our scanners show stable radiation and electromagnetic readings. It’s still too high to communicate with the outside world, but the Breach is sealed. It’s over.”\n\n*No, it’s not.*\n\nAware of just how many curious ears there were around us, I hugged the blanket tighter over my shoulders and jerked my head to the side. “A moment, Colonel?”\n\nHis face drew into a hard line, as if Riken could tell I was about to give him bad news, but he followed me away from the fire. Peter stayed where he was, content to enjoy his well-earned rest, while Chris and Jamie closed ranks with the colonel and I until we were out of earshot.\n\n“Barron County is going to vanish.” Amidst the curtain of snow, my breath fogged in the wind and reminded me of the old steam locomotives from a fair I’d been to as a child. “The Breach is closed, yes, but it’s going to pull Barron County down with it. Once it does, the area will stabilize for good, and in seven days we will be standing in a different world.”\n\nHis glower deepened, and Colonel Riken folded both muscled arms over his ruined armored vest. “Are you serious?”\n\nI met his hardened gaze and refused to look away so that the colonel knew I wasn’t lying. “The beacon killed the Oak Walker, and Vecitorak, but that left a vacuum that collapsed the Breach in on itself. You have to get Koranti to allow an evacuation, at least of those who want to stay in our world. Once we go through, there’s no coming back.”\n\nThe others stared at me, and I could tell they wanted to call me crazy but couldn’t find a justification for it. We’d all been there when the Oak Walker fell, they’d seen the road the same as I had. For us to be here now, after everything, without needing to leave our personal sacrifices behind meant that the Breach was in fact gone for good. Yet, like an enormous ship sinking slowly into the ocean, it couldn’t leave this world without dragging something down with it. Perhaps, like Professor Carheim said, it already had. Maybe the reason no one had ever heard of Barron County, remembered where the old dusty maps were in the local libraries, or asked about relatives from here, was because the collective memory of this place had already been eliminated . . . just not in the past as I had always assumed. No, in some strange loop that connected all of time, most knowledge of Barron Count had been expunged from the past the instant I’d closed the Breach, like a circuit being completed when a switch was thrown. This had been the path all along, the hidden destiny for which I was meant, and while it would have terrified the old Hannah, I couldn’t help but feel a glow of reassurance in my chest as Adam’s words from the chapel at Ark River flowed through my mind.\n\n*‘My ways are not your ways, my thoughts are not your thoughts.’*\n\n“You’re sure?” Chris seemed the most adamant to believe me, though his handsome face drew thin and pale with the news. “There’s nothing we can do to reverse it? No way to go back, find the road again and . . .”\n\n“No.” There was so much I knew, so much I wanted to talk to Chris about, but didn’t have the time, and so instead I shifted from one foot to the other in an effort to keep the chill at bay. “And we . . . we’re not meant to leave. I know it sounds insane, but some of us have to stay, have to cross over to the other timeline. I think it’s the same one the—”\n\nI froze, catching myself before I mentioned the missile silo in front of the colonel, but from the way Chris and Jamie tensed up, I could tell they understood. Colonel Riken’s eyebrow rose, but he seemed to get the hint, and didn’t press the matter.\n\n“So, what, we’ll end up back in time?” Jamie stuffed both hands into her wet jacket pockets and hunched her shoulders against the cruel wind.\n\n“Yes and no.” Wishing I could return to the fire, I blew warm air into my cupped fingers and did my best to elaborate so Riken could understand without revealing any defense secrets. “We’re going to an alternate reality, one where the Breach overran the world in the 1950’s and basically destroyed most of human civilization. If Tauerpin Road was a space between spaces, then the universe we’re going to is the space opposite ours. Does that make sense?”\n\n“Barely.” Colonel Riken let out an exasperated sigh and rubbed at the bridge of his nose. “But I’ve heard stranger things in my time. Either way, staying behind sounds like a death sentence.”\n\n*Or a second chance.*\n\nThinking back to the walk through the redeemed Tauerpin Road with *Him* at my side, I caught myself in a half smile. “From what I’ve been told, we’ll survive the crossing and are meant to start the reconstruction once we reach the other place. There’re others out there, just like us, who need help to fix things. That’s our job.”\n\n“If word gets out, people will panic.” Jamie rubbed her arms in a shiver and glanced at Chris. “Even if they believe us, the Assembly won’t support anyone staying behind. Hannah, we trust you, it’s just . . .”\n\n“No one will stay if Koranti opens the border.” With his thumbs hooked into his pistol belt, Colonel Riken finished Jamie’s thought for her, and his eyes drifted to the waiting helicopters nearby. “Whoever told you all this might be reliable, but it won’t matter if the population riots. I’ll get in touch with Koranti, and see what can be done about evacuations, but in the meantime we need to get the wounded back to the safe zone. Mr. Stirling is in bad shape, and if he doesn’t get to a hospital soon—”\n\n*Boom.*\n\nIn the distance a flash lit up the horizon, not from thunder, but the deep tolling of artillery.\n\nEveryone in the cordon paused, their eyes focused on the north, and dozens of more explosions began to flicker against the clouds. Pilots climbed down form their cockpits in the chinooks, gunners stood up in their turrets on the trucks, and even the medics slowed their brisk jogs back and forth to stare. It seemed no one, be it ELSAR or coalition, had the slightest idea what was going on, but as the seconds dragged by, the truth started to dawn on me.\n\nMy blood ran colder than the snow, and I turned to one of the nearest coalition soldiers. “Private, get me a radio.”\n\nHe came running back a few moments later, and the man held out one of the handsets from our relief convoy, his face white as the landscape from the sounds that came from the device’s speakers.\n\n*“We can’t hold this position, there’s too many!”*\n\n*“Fast movers! Fighters coming in from the north! Six jets inbound!”*\n\n*“I’ve got tanks all over my sector, where the hell is our artillery support?”*\n\n*“All units, collapse in on the square! I say again, the northern district is gone, collapse in on the square! Fall back!”*\n\nStunned, I turned to Colonel Riken, who seemed equally confused, and pointed to the horizon. “What the hell is this?”\n\nAnnoyed at his own radio not responding, Colonel Riken waved to one of his nearby men, the mercenaries growing more uneasy by the minute. “Find me a comms set that works, *now*.”\n\nJamie glared at him and tightened both hands on her well-worn Kalashnikov. “This was a trick. You did this on purpose, didn’t you? We get the Breach out of the way, and while we’re gone, you send your boys to restart the occupation.”\n\nHer words spread across the nearby soldiers like wildfire, anger replacing surprise on the faces of our men. Indignant murmurs turned into audible growls of discontent, and the encampment formed into two separate ranks, ELSAR men on one side, our own forces on the other. Weapon safeties clicked off, gun turrets swiveled around on their armored charges, and we found ourselves facing each other across a prickly line of steel. No one dared level a rifle yet, but from how tense things were getting, I knew it was only a matter of time before someone lost their cool.\n\n“Everyone just stay calm.” Chris raised his hands to gesture for our men to keep their weapons lowered, pacing between them and the mercenaries to keep anyone from disobeying. “I said stand down, we’re going to handle this. Colonel, start talking.”\n\nOne of his troopers ran up with a functional radio, and Colonel Riken jammed the talk button down to snap orders into the speaker, his tone sharp as a knife. “Overlord, this is Primarch, requesting status update, over.”\n\nNothing.\n\n“Overlord, this is Primarch, we are green on our mission objectives, requesting mission status update.” He shifted on his boots as the bombing intensified, and somewhere high overhead, I caught the rumble of airplane engines for the first time in months. “I say again, this is Primarch, we are green on our mission, awaiting further instructions. Someone talk to me, over.”\n\nMy gut churned at tiny arches of light that shot through the clouds miles to the north and slammed down in the space that I knew was Black Oak. They were hitting us with multiple launch rocket systems, just like at New Wilderness. Such weapons had reduced our hilltop fortress to cinders, and in the densely packed streets of a city, they would wreak unimaginable damage on civilian and military targets alike. Whatever this was, ELSAR wasn’t pulling any punches, and I quietly palmed my Type 9 that still hung by my side on its ragged strap.\n\n*Is Jamie right? Was this all a setup? Riken doesn’t seem to know any more than I do, how could they not let their commanding officer know about an offensive?*\n\nA vein rose in the skin of his neck, and Colonel Riken ground his teeth, ready to erupt like a hand grenade. “Central Command, this is Colonel Riken. Someone better get on the horn and figure their life out or so help me they will wish they’d never been born. Our mission is complete, and we await further instructions. Do you read us, over?”\n\n*“Loud and clear, colonel.”*\n\nThe surprise on the colonel’s weathered face reflected my own, as Crow’s smug voice slithered out of the radio speaker like venom on the wind. “Captain McGregor? What in God’s name are you doing on this frequency?”\n\n*“Oh, it’s not ‘captain’ anymore.”* She chuckled back with confidence that made my skin crawl even from several feet away. *“I’m afraid there’s been a change of command. You are hereby no longer part of the Ohio task force. All callsigns and intel clearances to your former rank have been revoked.”*\n\n“On who’s authority?” The second he had a chance to talk, Riken smashed his thumb into the talk button, gripping the handset so hard I thought the metal would bend.\n\n*“Mine.”* Crow hissed back, both satisfied and hateful, as if she’d been waiting a long time for this moment. *“Koranti needs loyal officers to lead this campaign, and I can do a better job of cleaning up the insurgency, so we came to an agreement. As brigadier general of the new expeditionary force, I will take over from here on; you are to return to headquarters at once for reassignment.”*\n\nStruck speechless for a brief second at the command, Colonel Riken shook his head in furious bewilderment. “Reassignment? Did you not hear a word I said? We completed our mission, the Breach is closed, the operation was a success!”\n\n*“And yet, the beacon signal was never received.”* She spoke with a haughty, almost bored tone, one that cold alongside the detonations of artillery fire in the distance. *“Which means the coalition is in direct violation of their ceasefire agreement. Execute any insurgents within your vicinity, and report back to us.”*\n\nNot far from the nearest burn barrel, Peter clutched Tarren to his shoulder and slid one hand to a pistol on his hip. His dark eyes met mine from across the snow, and the pirate made a slight shake of his head. If I trusted anyone to know when things had gone sour, it was Peter, and that look made my pulse jump into another level of fear.\n\n*We’re all standing right here, if they open fire, we’ll all butcher each other like rabid dogs.*\n\n“Fool!” The colonel shouted into the radio, losing his cool at last. “This is madness, can’t you see that it’s over? We did our job, *we had a deal*, and you want to start this up again? I have wounded men on the ground out here, we’re black on ammo, what the hell am I supposed to do?”\n\nThere was a pause on the other end, and I couldn’t decide whether I thought Crow might be laughing or suppressing her own rage.\n\n*“Carry out your orders, colonel.”* Sheer defiant indifference radiated from her words as Crow signed off. *“Kill the insurgent leaders and evac to the rear. We’re going to finish this, Riken . . . with or without you.”*\n\nWith a frustrated snarl, Colonel Riken spun on his boot heel and threw the handset against the nearby burn barrel so hard that it dented the rusted steel drum.\n\nSilence reigned in the cordon, and I noticed how tired everyone looked in the flickering firelight, both coalition and ELSAR alike. Despite their suspicious glowering at one another, both sides were bloodied, exhausted, and soaked to the bone. Any fight that happened now would reap a dreadful harvest among us all, the men too close for the bullets to miss, and too worn out to make a run for the trees. Only the injured men jammed inside the passenger compartments for warmth remained outside this confrontation, watching with confusion and intrigue from the narrow gunports. Rigid in the cold, we all waited, eyed our opponents, and wondered what would come next.\n\nColonel Riken stood with hands on his hips, breathing hard in his anger, and my guts tightened in apprehension.\n\n*Oh man, this is going to get ugly . . .*\n\n“Well gentlemen, I’m not going to sugarcoat this.” Turning to face his men, Colonel Riken composed himself and walked down the line of his beleaguered men like a sports coach before the last big game. “You’ve been through hell. Tonight, you won a war no one will remember, much less thank you for. Every man here has gone above and beyond what you signed up to do, and I’m damn proud to be your commanding officer.”\n\nHe met the gaze of each soldier, spoke to them as a father to his sons, and the ranks of heavily armed mercenaries parted to let Riken stride amongst them with almost hallowed respect. “If anyone wants to, he can climb into a chopper and head for the rest of our units back at the county line. No one will stop you or think less of you for it, least of all me. You can tell them the insurgents fled, that you fought bravely, and that I gave you orders to withdraw. They’ll welcome you as heroes, give you medals, pay bonuses, maybe even promotions. You’ll have enough to call it quits after this tour and go home to stay. God knows, you deserve that much at least.”\n\nTheir expressions reflected confusion at his words, but the mercenaries didn’t interrupt him as Colonel Riken paced before them, up and down the line of rifles. Our own troops furrowed their brows, but stayed where they were, the entire cordon hanging on the man’s every word.\n\n“As for me, I’m a soldier.” As if on parade inspection, the colonel walked with a back straight as a ramrod, head held high in pride. “Like you, I swore to protect the people of this nation from harm and signed on with ELSAR because I believed we were a force for good. I still think we can be . . . but not while men like Koranti are in charge.”\n\nSurprise rippled through me, and murmurs flitted amongst the coalition ranks. No one had ever heard the mercs talk this way, certainly not one of their high-ranking officers. Could this be another ruse to catch us off guard? Or was this something more?\n\nJamie and I caught one another’s peripheral gaze, and she lowered her AK from the tense position near her shoulder.\n\n“The way I see it, we made a deal, and I intend to honor my word. These people are not our enemy, not anymore.” He cast a glance in our direction, and Colonel Riken granted me a small nod. “It’s time someone led ELSAR back to its true purpose, and if no one else will, I’ll do it myself.”\n\nFrigid air stuck in my lungs, and I had to remind myself to drag another breath in.\n\n*Is this what I think it is?*\n\nWithout another word, Riken tore the number identification patch off his tactical jacket, crossed over to the rusted burning oil drum, and hurled the insignia into the flames.\n\nLong seconds ticked by, the ELSAR men blinking at his actions, their stunned looks mirrored by our coalition troopers on the opposite side of the cordon. All of the former rage and distrust seemed to have melted away in sheer amazement at the spectacle we’d witnessed. In a way, it seemed both sides didn’t quite know what to do, many looking down at their weapons as if they weren’t sure of anything anymore. At last, one of the gray-clad mercenaries stepped out of the line and stalked closer to Riken.\n\nI recognized the sergeant who had picked me up to put me on the gurney all those days ago, his face smeared with soot, one arm bandaged. Like the rest, he wore a little bar of numbers stitched in a Velcro patch over his plate carrier front, simple black figures that rendered the sergeant no more important than a warehouse shipping crate. They were all like that, nameless men, purposefully stripped of what made them human by a soulless organization that spent their lives cheaply. Koranti had done it on purpose, I realized; yes, it must have been on purpose, for even the calculating bureaucrat had known that men with names form thoughts. Men who thought would begin to question, and those who questioned might refuse. If I knew anything about George M. Koranti, he *hated* being told ‘no.’\n\nWith a single fluid motion, the sergeant ripped the number patch from his uniform, flicked it into the flames, and gave Colonel Riken a trim salute.\n\nInstead of saluting back, Colonel Riken reached out to shake his hand and drew the soldier into a half-embrace with his other arm, welcoming him. This Riken did as the rest came one by one, like a father to his wayward sons, more filing in from the vehicles to add their patches to the fire. Not a single mercenary remained behind, all of them throwing their support behind their commander with absolute trust.\n\n“Well, I’ll be damned.” Next to me, Chris wore the ghost of a disbelieving grin and muttered under his breath in a tone only I managed to hear. “The old lion really did it. *Ave Caeser*.”\n\nI didn’t understand what he meant, but my husband’s optimism filled me with a sense of renewed calm, and I felt the budding of my own hopeful smile.\n\n*I guess I’m not the only ‘person of interest’ anymore. What I wouldn’t pay to see Koranti’s face when his legions turn on him. Whatever happens, it serves him right.*\n\nHis blue eyes aglow with a determination that could move mountains, Colonel Riken took in the group of men surrounding him with an approving smile. “Right then, let’s get to it. NCO’s take charge of your squads and get me an ammo count for each. Top off whatever you need from the trucks, ditch anything you can’t carry, and get our wounded loaded asap. We’re wheels-up in ten mikes.”\n\nAs if released from a magical spell, the ELSAR soldiers broke up in smaller groups to attend to their tasks, moving with fresh enthusiasm. Medics scurried back to their patients, some of the troops intermingled as the mercenaries handed off heavier bits of gear they couldn’t take with them, and a few even exchanged solemn handshakes with their coalition partners. Those on our side traded rations for rocket launches, portable mortars, or even land mines, and just like that, the tension went out of the air.\n\nRiken shouldered through the buzz of activity to us, angling his head at the echoes of battle in the north. “From the sound of it, they’re moving in with lots of armor and mechanized infantry. I figure they’ll flank the city on two sides and try to roll over the county in the next 72 hours. We can leave most of our heavy equipment with you, but it won’t be enough to stop them all; you need to get your people out of there.”\n\n“Thanks to you, we might have a fighting chance.” Chris gestured to the line of trucks Riken’s men were unloading as they prepared to board the helicopters to abandon the zone. “But where will you go? You don’t seriously intend face Koranti with a handful of men?”\n\n“No.” Riken frowned at continued artillery barrage on the horizon. “If he’s thought ahead enough to have me demoted while I’m out in the field, then he’s probably expecting some sort of provocation. We’ll head for the north-western border and raid one of the supply depos there before splitting up into covert teams. Once Koranti realizes what’s going on, he’ll target our families for leverage, so our first mission will be to move them to safe houses all across the country. Then, we’ll see how many of our brothers in arms are willing to march with us.”\n\n“You think many will?” Jamie rested the bulk of her rifle’s weight on one hip.\n\n“Some, yes.” Colonel Riken sighed and arched his back to crack it under the ragged armored vest. “But Koranti won’t take this lying down; he’ll find ways to suppress dissent amongst the ranks through his usual methods. We’ve got a lot of ground to cover before central command figures out we’re AWOL. If they send enough men to chase us, it might thin out the border guards enough that you could make a breakthrough, but I’m afraid we can’t do much more than that.”\n\n*Even if we survive this attack, we’ve got seven days before it all goes under. That will end the war one way or another. Once this county slips through the Breach, we’ll never see each other again . . . I just hope Koranti gets trapped on Riken’s side of reality.*\n\nAt that thought, I stepped forward to offer my grimy palm. “It’s been an honor, colonel.”\n\nHe shook my hand, and Colonel Riken’s features pulled into a cynical, melancholy expression. “Likewise, captain. I’d say until we meet again but . . . well, with any luck, neither of us will. I hope you make it to wherever you’re going.”\n\nAs our column prepared for our immediate return to Black Oak, I watched the bulky gray helicopters rise into the sky, their steel rotors thundering as the iron giants zoomed away into the west. The further they went toward the edge of Barron County, flashes of light began to pockmark the dark clouds around them, and I wondered if the ELSAR border defense had turned their anti-aircraft guns on the retreating choppers. I had no way of knowing, as the helicopters were soon far out of sight in the darkness, the flashes fading as well. In less than five minutes, we were on our own once more.\n\n“All right, I want head counts from every squad.” Chris hefted his rifle, and waved our men into action, Jamie and I flanking him to charge for the convoy in gusto. “Trucks with wounded stay in the center, armed ones on the vanguard and tail. As soon as we get to the outskirts, those of us who can still fight will peel off to support the front. Let’s move out!”\n\nJamie gave me a hand up into the lead truck, and Chris climbed in after me. Snow pelted down from the clouds outside, the vehicles skidded over the slippery ground, but we clawed our way out of the field to the closest road and headed back toward the fighting. I sat beside my friends on the heated seats of the MRAP armored trucks, hugged the woolen blanket closer around my shoulders, and tried to ignore the continued *thud-thud* of shells to the north. We were driving into a meat grinder, there was no doubt about that. If we retreated, the coalition would be forced out into the countryside, and the only safe place would be Ark River many miles to the south. If we stayed in Black Oak, we would be surrounded and ground into powder by ELSAR’s artillery. All this combined in my mind to repeat the words of the One who had given me the path I now found myself on.\n\n*Your suffering will increase even further before the end.*\n\nHuddling closer to Chris, I rested my head on his shoulder and shut my eyes in an attempt to catch some rest for the colossal struggle ahead."},"86":{"title":"The woman in my drain started speaking to me, and I wish I had never listened","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k7wnt3\/the_woman_in_my_drain_started_speaking_to_me_and\/","flair":null,"author":"Bongobongosrevenge","selftext":"Last week, me and my husband moved into a small house we bought deep in the country.\n\nIt was a nice change from our tiny, cramped apartment overlooking the bustling city we had called home for so many years. Until the sink started talking to me.\n\nIt started out as quiet murmurs whenever somebody turned the tap on, but I wrote it off as the plumbing. It *was* an old house after all. Until one morning, I woke up to get water for the coffee pot, and I heard her clear as day for the first time.\n\n\"Hello? Can you hear me? I need help, please.\"\n\nI took a step back, bumping into the kitchen table and almost dropping the coffee pot. Then my husband, Harold, strolled into the room.\n\n\"Hey hun, where's the coffee? I gotta leave for work soon.\" He said, doing up his tie and buttoning his cuffs.\n\n\"Harold, I just heard a woman's voice coming from the sink.\"\n\n\"Babe, you're just hearing things. We were in the city a long time, your brain is just trying to fill in the gaps of silence with noise, look.\"\n\nHarold cupped his mouth with his hands and hunched over the sink.\n\n\"HELLOOOOO DOWN THERE!!\".\n\nHe paused before looking up at me with a big goofy grin. \"See? Nobody dow-\"\n\nHarold's words were cut short by the garbage disposal grinding to life and catching his tie, pulling him into the sink in a death-grip.\n\n*HOLY SHIT, HAROLD!* I tried flicking the switch next to the sink to turn off the machine, but it was no use. Thinking fast, I quickly ran over to the kitchen drawer to grab a pair of scissors, and began snipping away at the back of the tie, severing my husband from his pinstripe noose.\n\nHarald took a couple of deep breaths as we watched the rest of the tie being sucked down the sink like a starving man slurping spaghetti. As soon as the tie was out of sight, the garbage disposal shut off.\n\n\"Woah, that was scary. I didn't know that thing was automatic\" said Harold.\n\nIt wasn't. But I was too shaken up to let him know that.\n\nLate that same night, I woke up totally parched and wandered into the kitchen for some water. I eyeballed the sink, but decided to grab something from the fridge instead.\n\nAs I rooted around for a bevy, I heard a soft, feminine voice from behind me.\n\n\"Hello? I know you're there. Please talk to me.\"\n\nStartled, I turned around to face the sink.\n\n\"H-hello? Who are you? *What* are you?\" I stammered out.\n\n\"My name is Melissa, and... I'm not sure what I am anymore.\" She sounded sad and tired.\n\n\"Okay\" I said, trying to decide if I could make sense of what was going on, or if I had completely lost my mind. \"You turned on the garbage disposal earlier, right? You could have killed my husband!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, but I don't trust men. I don't want you to go through what I did. My husband murdered me after I caught him having an affair. He cut my heart out and jammed it down the garbage disposal.\"\n\n\"I'm so sorry, that's awful\" I said; also realizing I would need to have a chat with my realtor about how they failed to mention a fucking *murder* had taken place in this house.\n\n\"Earlier, you said you needed help, right?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes, it's an awfully big favor to ask. But please! I think you're my only hope to be set free\".\n\nI was a little taken aback.\n\n\"How?\" I asked.\n\n\"My husband buried my remains somewhere under this house. I can't rest until they're properly buried. Please, I've been trapped in this sink for so long now.\" Melissa said, weeping.\n\n\"Well, how will I know where to look?\"\n\n\"With your new eye\" Melissa said. Then the tap turned on and began to run a fluorescent green liquid as she continued on. \"Just cover one eye, and run the other under this this. Be sure to bandage it up and wrap it in gauze afterwards. In the morning, cut the bandages off and you'll have a new eye, one that can see all things dead and far into the other side.\"\n\nI was a little shocked at her proposal. But I didn't know how shocked I should be. I *was* having a conversation with my kitchen sink. I approached the running faucet, hesitated, then held my hair behind my head, covered my right eye and let the water trickle over my left.\n\nThe water had a weird tingling sensation to it. Like somebody was tickling the back of my eyeball with a feather and I desperately wanted to scratch it. I ignored the feeling until the water shut off.\n\n\"All done!\" Melissa said gleefully. \"I'm so excited for tomorrow! Quick, go bandage that bad boy up! I'll be waiting!\"\n\nI did just that. After dressing my eye, I felt lethargic and my body felt heavy. I shuffled my way back to bed and fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow.\n\nWhen I woke up, everything felt wrong. I had a headache like a colony of fire-ants were throwing Coachella in my skull. I rolled over to see Harold had already gone to work. I looked past his spot on the mattress to the bedside clock, and saw it was almost 1pm.\n\nI reached up to grab my throbbing temple, and felt the bandage I'd done up the night before. I walked out to the kitchen to grab some scissors and greeted Melissa, but she didn't respond.\n\n*Maybe she can only talk at night?* I wondered, fumbling through the drawer for the scissors. I retrieved a pair and my headache began to worsen. I stumbled to the bathroom and did a double take when I got to the mirror.\n\nMy face looked gaunt and pale and my hair, previously voluminous and blonde, looked thin and brittle. I stifled a scream and opened the bathroom cabinet for some sort of painkiller, but everything was gone. Well, everything but a pair of nail clippers.\n\nWith a trembling hand, I focused my sights on the mirror and snipped the strand of bandage I had wrapped around my head, and unwound it until I was just looking at the gauze pad. I took a deep breath in, and began to peel it off.\n\nI don't really know how to describe what I felt next. It was like an emotional cocktail of anger, sadness and disgust.\n\nMy iris, formally ice blue, was now a pale, milky, grey blotch. The rest of my eye was beyond a jaundice shade of yellow and looked more like a ball of rotten, coagulated turkey gravy left over from a thanksgiving's meal.\n\nAnother wave of pain surged throughout my head. I couldn't think anymore. I just had to act.\n\nI ran into the kitchen and began screaming at Melissa, demanding to know what she had done to me. But again, there was no response. All I knew, was that I had to do something about that eye. The pain from it was blocking out all rational thought. I approached the drawer again, grabbed a spoon, and headed back to the bathroom.\n\nIt took several attempts to slide the spoon under my eye, but eventually I made it happen. When I tried to jimmy the spoon upwards to pop the eyeball out, the spoon simply slid through my pupil like jell-o. I made several more attempts, the pain worsening each time until I couldn't take it anymore and just jammed my index finger into the corner of my eye, hooked the optical nerve and pulled it out.\n\nI reached down for the scissors where I placed them on the sink, but they were gone. I was in too much pain to keep looking for them and realized I would have to find another way to sever this abomination.\n\nThe spoon had slide through my eye no problem, but was too dull to saw through the cord. I tried stabbing at it several times as as it hung off my cheekbone, oozing yellow puss thick as dish soap with every thrust of the utensil.\n\nThat's when I remembered the nail clippers. I flung the cabinet open, grabbed them, and pulled my eyeball tight as I chewed away at the cord with them. After a painful minute or so that stretched on for an eternity, the cord snapped and shot back into my head like an elastic band. And I was left alone, lying on the cool, quiet, tile floor, clutching the smashed remains of my eyeball in my hand.\n\nI crawled back out into the kitchen and began pleading for Melissa to talk to me. But instead of her soft, kitten-like voice, I heard a deep booming laugh echoing off the walls.\n\nI'm terrified and don't know what to do now. All the doors and windows are locked, and every time I try to call Harold I just hear that fucking deep laugh. It's pitch black outside, so black it's like my house is sitting in a void. None of the clocks are working either, even the one on my phone keeps sporadically changing.\n\nI summoned all my strength to go back and look in the bathroom mirror and saw a ghostly little figure in the dark hole where my eye was. Laughing, taunting, and beckoning me into my own skull. None of this makes any sense. I even googled the house and there was only one previous owner. No Melissa, no murder.\n\nI'm looking worse with I can only assume is every hour passing. This has to be some kind of demon, but what? Do any of you have some advice?"},"87":{"title":"My friend disappeared for 6 hours in the Pine Barrens.

Not off trail. Just a straight shot down Batsto River Road before doubling back at sunset. The Pine Barrens are quiet in that weird, almost oppressive way—like the trees are holding their breath. But it was nothing we hadn’t done before.\n\nUntil Jared vanished.\n\nIt was only for a second. I looked back and he was gone.\n\nNo sound. No struggle. No footprints off the path. Just me standing there, calling his name into the brush.\n\nI searched for two hours.\n\nThen he came back.\n\nHe walked out of the woods like nothing had happened. Calm. Pale. Eyes a little too wide.\n\nI ran up, asked him where he went.\n\nHe just blinked and said, “What do you mean? You were the one who left.”\n\nThat night, I noticed the scratches on his arms. Long ones. Parallel. Like talons. When I asked, he looked confused and said they were already there.\n\nThey weren’t.\n\nHe’s been different since.\n\nHe doesn’t blink as often. His voice sounds like someone else trying to mimic him. He stares out the window for hours.\n\nLast night I caught him whispering something.\n\nNot English.\n\nSomething low and broken. Like a recording played backward.\n\nI confronted him.\n\nHe smiled—too wide—and said: “He showed me where the sky ends.”\n\nThe next morning, Jared was gone again.\n\nNo note. No shoes. Just the front door swinging open on its hinges, like he didn’t care about letting something else inside.\n\nI told myself to stay put.\n\nBut after an hour of pacing the living room, I couldn’t help it.\n\nI grabbed the recorder we’d used for trail logs, stuffed it in my jacket pocket, and followed the tree line behind the house where his tracks disappeared.\n\nThe Barrens are different at night. Even in the daylight, you can tell. The sand feels colder. The trees lean in closer. Like they want to hear you breathing.\n\nI found him about a mile in.\n\nStanding completely still.\n\nHead tilted back, staring at the sky so hard I thought his neck would snap.\n\nHe was whispering again. That same garbled language—like broken static, like something trying to crawl into my ears.\n\nI clicked the recorder on.\n\nFor a moment, he didn’t move.\n\nThen he spoke in perfect English.\n\n“You’re early,” he said.\n\nBefore I could even process that, he turned toward me.\n\nHis mouth moved first—lips stretching unnaturally wide, like his skin was too loose. Then the rest of his face caught up.\n\nAnd when he smiled, I saw it:\n\nThe teeth.\n\nNot rows.\n\nNot human.\n\nThey were jagged, twisted like snapped branches jammed into gums too soft to hold them.\n\nAnd his eyes weren’t Jared’s anymore.\n\nThey were glassy.\n\nLike an animal that had been left to rot.\n\nI ran.\n\nI didn’t look back. I just sprinted until my legs gave out somewhere near the old firebreak road.\n\nWhen I finally caught my breath, I pulled out the recorder.\n\nI expected static.\n\nMaybe my own panicked breathing.\n\nBut when I hit play—\n\nIt wasn’t Jared’s voice at all.\n\nIt was something else.\n\nSomething deeper.\n\nSlow.\n\nBreathing.\n\nLong, shuddering inhales, followed by wet, shuffling sounds. Something big. Something that wasn’t alone.\n\nAnd just at the edge of it—\n\nYou can hear my name.\n\nWhispered, over and over.\n\nGrowing closer.\n\nI’m still listening to it now, sitting in the truck with the doors locked, trying to figure out what to do.\n\nBecause just a few minutes ago, I saw Jared again.\n\nHe’s standing at the edge of the tree line.\n\nSmiling.\n\nBut there’s something wrong with his skin this time.\n\nLike it’s starting to slip.\n\nAnd something underneath is pushing to get out.\n\nHe didn’t sleep that night.\n\nJust sat in the living room, facing the window, whispering in that language again.\n\nI recorded it.\n\nDidn’t plan to—I just opened the voice memo app out of instinct, like part of me knew I shouldn’t be hearing it alone.\n\nWhen I played it back later, it was silent.\n\nNot low quality. Not muffled.\n\nJust nothing. Like the app refused to acknowledge what I’d captured.\n\nBut my phone did something else.\n\nThe time on the recording said 6 hours and 13 minutes, even though I only listened for ten seconds.\n\nAnd in the background—barely visible in the waveform—was something pulsing.\n\nLike a heartbeat.\n\nThat’s when I noticed Jared wasn’t in the living room anymore.\n\nThe front door was open.\n\nThere were hoofprints in the hallway.\n\nI grabbed a flashlight and followed the tracks out into the woods. I didn’t know what else to do. He wasn’t answering his phone, and my gut kept screaming that if I waited, I’d never see him again.\n\nThe prints led off the trail.\n\nDeep into the trees.\n\nFarther than we ever hiked.\n\nAnd the deeper I went, the quieter it got.\n\nNo birds.\n\nNo wind.\n\nEven my own footsteps stopped making noise after a while. Like the air had gotten too thick to carry sound.\n\nThat’s when I found him.\n\nStanding in the middle of a clearing, barefoot, shirtless, eyes rolled back.\n\nThe sky above him looked wrong—too low, like it was sagging over the trees. Cloudless. Heavy. Humming.\n\nHe was whispering again.\n\nThe same language.\n\nBut this time… something answered.\n\nNot aloud. Not with words.\n\nBut through the dirt.\n\nThrough the trees.\n\nThrough me.\n\nI felt it crawl up my spine like cold teeth.\n\nJared turned toward me.\n\nHis arms were longer now.\n\nFingers too.\n\nThe skin at his joints looked stretched, thin enough to tear.\n\nAnd from his back—just beneath the shoulder blades—something twitched.\n\nTrying to push its way through.\n\nHe smiled.\n\nNot wide this time.\n\nJust… knowingly.\n\nAnd said, “He knows your name now.”\n\nHe took a step toward me.\n\nJust one.\n\nBut the sound that came with it wasn’t right. Not the snap of twigs or the crunch of dirt—just a wet, sinking noise, like something pulling itself free from deep mud.\n\nThe air around him shimmered.\n\nThen something else stepped out from behind him.\n\nIt was tall. Wrong. Built like it remembered being a man, but had grown in the shape of something else. Its legs bent the wrong way. Its hooves were split and cracked. And its skin was the color of ash soaked in blood, stretched too thin across a skeleton that didn’t match.\n\nIt didn’t look at me.\n\nIt looked through me.\n\nAnd in that instant, my knees buckled.\n\nMy head felt like it had been filled with static. Not sound—pressure. Like every thought I’d ever had was being pulled up and sifted through by something that didn’t know what memory was, but wanted to wear one.\n\nI think I screamed.\n\nOr maybe I didn’t.\n\nJared spoke again—his voice all wrong now, like he had too many teeth behind it.\n\n“He’s trying you on,” he said.\n\nThe thing stepped forward.\n\nI didn’t move. Couldn’t.\n\nIts fingers—or claws, or branches—brushed my chest.\n\nAnd that’s when I saw its face.\n\nIt didn’t have one.\n\nNot really.\n\nJust folds of skin, like wings that hadn’t opened yet. But beneath them, where a mouth might be, was something moving.\n\nMimicking.\n\nI watched my own mouth form in its skin.\n\nMy jaw.\n\nMy nose.\n\nMy scream.\n\nAnd then—suddenly—I was back on the trail.\n\nAlone.\n\nMiddle of the day.\n\nNo Jared.\n\nNo creature.\n\nJust my flashlight in one hand, and my phone in the other.\n\nAnd a new recording I don’t remember making.\n\nIt’s exactly 6 hours and 13 minutes long.\n\nI haven’t listened to it yet.\n\nBut I can see the waveform.\n\nThere’s a voice in it.\n\nOne that sounds like mine.\n\nOnly it’s still speaking.\n\nEven when the file is paused.\n\n"},"88":{"title":"I keep having the same dream about being buried alive","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k7zcgw\/i_keep_having_the_same_dream_about_being_buried\/","flair":null,"author":"ResearcherHeavy827","selftext":"I am not sure how much more I can take. I've seen doctors, every different type of spiritual healer, and have even tried an exorcism. But no matter what I try, I cannot stop having the same dream every night. \n\nI close my eyes at night. In my dreams, I wake up buried alive.\n\nEvery night, it goes like this. \n\nBy the dim light of a match that was quickly burning out, I could see wood surrounding me. I am underground. When I press up on the top of the wooden coffin, nothing moves. The earth is packed tight around me, and the ground does not yield an inch in my efforts. I scream and thrash to only succeed at cutting my skin on ragged and rusted nails sticking out where time had shifted them out of their place in the wood. My cries for help go unheard by nothing other than the worms that lay beside me. But unlike myself, they are at least granted the freedom of movement. This wooden tomb is hardly bigger than my own body. It takes what feels like hours for the match to burn out. When it does, I'm plunged into darkness. And then, I woke up.\n\nEvery time I have that dream, I wake up gasping for breath, like the earth from my dreams had settled its way into my lungs. Once I can catch my breath, I brush my teeth because I can taste soil on my tongue. I've never been especially claustrophobic, but after the first time, I cannot go anywhere smaller than my bathroom. Otherwise, it starts to feel like the walls are closing in on me.\n\nI've had vivid dreams before, but I've never had dreams that lingered in the way that they do. I remember every detail of being underground. Maybe it's because of the frequency of the dream, but it feels more like a memory. Over time, I learned the place of every nail, every plank of wood, and grain of dirt is placed in that coffin. I know what it feels like to be squeezed underneath the weight of six feet of packed dirt and rock and the breath in damp, stale air until I am dizzy from lack of fresh oxygen. The only thing that changes is the amount of time it takes for the match to burn out.\n\nAt the beginning, it only takes a few minutes. It doesn't last longer than any other dream, in the sense that it feels like hardly any time passed at all once I was awake. But as I keep having the dream, time becomes more concrete. I am in the coffin for 10 minutes, then half an hour, then an hour, then two. I count the seconds in the dreams, and I remember where I left off when the match goes out and I am awake. The counting gives me something to do. It keeps me sane.\n\nIt takes two months for it to reach 8 hours, like I'm having the dream in real time. I wake up sore and cramping, like I've actually been lying in a tight box for 8 hours. \n\nIt crosses my mind more than once that someone has been kidnapping me every night just to bury me underground. I would sincerely believe it if I weren't for the match.\n\nI've tried to put out the match myself to wake up faster, but it's always just out of reach. It doesn't make sense. There's not enough room in the coffin for anything to be out of reach. But when I move to smother the flame, it's always just on the edge of where I can stretch. It burns more and more slowly every night.\n\nAnother month passes. One night, I was in that horrible box for 16 hours. I was only asleep for 6 hours on the night it reached the 16-hour mark. During my waking hours, I desperately searched for answers. But so far, no one has been able to give me any. I am not religious, but I try different prayers as earnestly and faithfully as I can manage. Doctors give me sleeping pills, but I'm scared to take them. The longer I'm asleep, the longer I am in the box.\n\nI don’t sleep. I can't stand to have the dream again, so I do what I can to avoid sleeping. Of course, it catches up to me fast. My mind started to break. I began to forget little things at first. Then I started to see things. They started out as dark and formless things at the edge of my vision that darted away when I tried to focus on them. I heard what sounded like my name being called, but when I turned towards the voice, there was no one there. I sleep in short bursts to keep myself running. No longer than 15 minutes, if I can help it. I don’t dare let myself slip into REM sleep. Of course, sometimes I’m so tired that no amount of alarms will wake me up. But I sleep for as little as I can get away with.\n\nI stopped going out, stopped working, and stopped taking care of myself. I told my job and my family that I was sick. And when they asked for details, I shut down the conversation.\n\nYesterday, is when I realized that I was running out of time. \n\nI found a hole in my backyard. \n\nIt's not that deep, but I don't remember how it got there. It was only after I saw it that I noticed that there was dirt caked under my fingernails. My arms ached like I'd been lifting something heavy over and over. I do not remember digging that hole, but I know that I am the one digging it. I know I am sleep deprived, but I should not be losing such large chunks of time yet. I shouldn’t even have the energy to spend digging up the dirt with my bare hands.\n\nI ended up sleeping for 5 hours last night, according to the clock. But I was buried for so much longer. I'm not ashamed to admit I spent the entire time crying and begging for help, gasping and choking on stale air. And even when I finally woke up, I still lay on my side for a long time, begging for help from anything that might hear me.\n\nThere was soil in my sheets. Beetles and earthworms scattered and writhed across my skin. I could picture my body melting into the earth itself, becoming no longer a home for my own soul, but for the forgotten things that lived underneath the ground. I could only hope that I would cease to be, rather than stay tethered to the spot where I would continue to rot until the end of time.\n\nWhen I gathered the courage to climb out of bed and look out at my backyard, the hole was bigger. \n\nI stared at it for a long time. I don’t know how long. The hole seemed to stretch on endlessly. I felt that if I fell down into it, I would be swallowed. The earth would seal over around me and the grass would grow like I had never made a mark at all. The earth would no longer be my home, but my prison and my devourer.\n\nWhen I washed my hands, the sink ran brown and red, and I could see where the skin around my fingernails was split.\n\nI am writing this during the brief period of lucidity I get after waking up from that dream. If anyone knows why this is happening to me, please, tell me how to fix this. When I look down into the growing pit in the earth, I see my fate staring back at me, and I cannot stand it."},"89":{"title":"I inherited sleepwalking from my dad.

It was horrible, sure, but not exactly surprising. He never spelled it out, but his childhood sounded pretty horrible, and whatever he dragged out of that hellhole followed him into adulthood. I wasn’t there when it happened—if the town gossip is to be believed—when my mum found him, she took a long drag on her ciggie, blew smoke toward the ceiling and muttered to the constable, deadpan as anything: “Figures he’d go out like his dad.” \n\nCold, yes. But technically accurate. He did top himself in the exact same way his dad did. \n\nThen about eight years later, my older brother followed suit. Eleven months after that, my uncle. Both of his sons, too, eventually—though I wasn’t close to my cousins, so I couldn’t tell you when exactly they clocked out. It was just something I learnt of months or years after the fact, after bumping into some mutual acquaintance in the grocery store and it was mentioned in passing.\n\nSuicide clusters happen, right? It’s a thing. Some psychologist somewhere would probably say it was environmental or neurological or some fancy combination of both—poke around our grey matter and pin it all on some rogue gene or deeply ingrained trauma. Stamp a tidy little explanation on the mess and call it a day. \n\nThat’s what I thought, anyway. Seemed logical. Made sense.  \n\nI’d argue misery’s the default setting for most men—especially when there aren’t enough distractions to drown it out. My family lived remote for generations—miners, mostly—and if the Sunday markets or drinking by the creek isn’t your thing, there was sweet fuck-all else to do. Let’s just say there’s a reason our town of roughly eight hundred people is considered the ice capitol of Western Australia. \n\nI’m telling you this because that’s the theory I clung to for years. Why the men in my family kept dropping like flies. We were just a long line of blokes raised hard by mothers who were too exhausted to love properly, and fathers who were either working or already dead. So far removed from anything resembling connection that the isolation—that insulation—settled on us like dust. That feeling of being small, inconsequential, stuck. It wears you down. Inherited misery. Plain and simple. \n\nSo, anyway. I turned seventeen, dropped out of school. My grades were shit, and every day I’d drive past the open pit at the Carbanak Resources Iron Mine and feel like if I didn’t move—didn’t do something—I’d end up at the bottom of it. So I left. Reached out to a cousin on my mum’s side I barely knew, who was looking for flatmates while she studied. Figured, why not. Gotta break the cycle somehow. \n\nAnd I did. Or I thought I did. \n\nAbout three months ago, I woke up standing in the middle of the bush.  \n\nNow, there were a few odd things about this. \n\nOne: it’s fucking disconcerting to wake up and not be in your bed—especially when you’re ninety percent sure that’s where you started. \n\nTwo: I live in metropolitan Melbourne. Suburbia. Public transport. Good coffee. If you see a possum, it’s in a wheelie bin. And suddenly, I’m in the *bush* bush. \n\nI’m talking paperbarks and gums. Midgies going to town on me like I’m the best thing they’ve tasted in years. The ground’s water-starved and rough, my bare feet are shredded, and I’m one unlucky step away from a funnel web or something blowing a gasket in my ankle. Phone was dead.  \n\nTook me almost two hours to stumble by way onto a highway, sweat-soaked and still in my pyjamas, before some trucker took pity on me and gave me a lift to the nearest petrol station where I had to borrow the clerks phone to ask my cousin for a lift.  \n\nAnd listen—because I’m open to being told I’m crazy—I’ll level with you. I’d had a fair bit to drink the afternoon before. Not blackout or anything, but enough that the tail-end of the night’s a bit fuzzy. I remember taking dozens of photos in a photobooth—still have those pictures somewhere, my arms draped around people whose names I don't remember.\n\nSo that was my best guess: that drunk-me had gone wandering, maybe chasing a late-night kebab (wouldn’t be the first time), misjudged the direction entirely and just kept going. \n\nOnly thing is, when I retraced the route later—by car—it would’ve taken me nearly six and a half hours on foot to get to where I woke up. Through bushland. No tracks. No roads. No clearings. Just scrub. \n\nAny other guy, any other family history, I might’ve called myself a bit of a legend and had a good laugh about it with my friends. Only, that day, when I woke up in the bush, I was so terrified I was *cold*, even staggering back in forty-degree heat.  \n\nBecause I’d seen this before. \n\nMy dad used to do the same thing.\n\nTowards the end—before he slung a length of rope over the steel beam in the shed and decided to see if he could fly—Dad would wander off all the time. \n\nGot to the point where Mum, who’d been sick of his shit for the better part of twelve years, just started leaving the back door propped open with an old shoe. Easier that way. Less banging when he tried to shoulder it open at dawn. \n\nSometimes I’d be halfway through my Weetabix when he’d stumble back in, covered in dirt or leaves with this look on his face. He wouldn’t talk to me—he wasn't much for talking, full stop—he’d just head straight for the shower. \n\nI was young—he died when I was twelve—so I didn’t think much of it at the time. Just Dad being Dad. Bit weird. Bit cooked. Part of the background noise of childhood. \n\nIt wasn’t until I got older that I realised what that expression was. That pinched, hollowed-out look he wore as he left bloody footprints down the hallway. Fear. I’m not talking jump-scare fear. I’m talking bone-deep, soul-wrung, world-ending terror. \n\nSo, after my little excursion, I started keeping tabs on myself. Nothing serious—just made a point of plugging my phone in before bed, setting the location tracker, that sort of thing. I also tried to remind myself that correlation doesn't equal causation or however the fuck that phrase goes. Just because I might’ve inherited this quirk from my dad, who ended up offing himself, didn’t necessarily mean I was destined to go off and off myself too. \n\nBut then it happened again.   \n   \nA few times, actually. \n\nThe next time, I woke up in the middle of a freeway about thirty kilometres west of the city. Headlights flashing past either side of me. Four AM. Wearing mismatched shoes and my cousin's university hoodie, which I hadn’t seen since we moved in together. No memory. Not a whisper. Just the sick certainty that I’d walked there. On foot. No phone, again. Only reason I got back was some tradie on his pre-dawn commute took pity on me. \n\nThen there was the time I woke up in someone’s backyard. Suburban, manicured, silent. A child’s swing set creaking gently in the breeze. It was still dark, but the porch light flicked on while I was getting my bearings and this middle-aged woman in a dressing gown stepped out, saw me, and dropped her cup of tea. Just shattered it on the concrete like something out of a movie. I mumbled something—no idea what—and legged it.  \n\nBooked in with a sleep specialist, took a look at the prices, cancelled it. Upped my melatonin intake, worked out like crazy to make sure I was dog-tired every time my head hit that pillow. Sometimes it helped, most times it didn’t.  \n\nOne time—this would've been about three weeks ago now—I woke up in the hallway of my flat. I’d returned home, somehow. Front door wide open, cold air pooling on the tiles like something had just come in or gone out. My breath was visible. My feet were wet. \n\nIt was 3:12 AM. \n\nI didn’t remember getting up. Didn’t remember unlocking anything. I did the usual: checked my hands, checked the soles of my feet. Looked for blood, mud, ink. Nothing. Just the weird, hollow headache I was starting to associate with these episodes. And the feeling. That pressing. Like I’d missed a step going down the stairs and my guts were still catching up. \n\nI staggered back to bed. Slept like shit. It wasn’t until this morning that I noticed the notification. Storage Almost Full. Which was weird, because I’m not a big photo guy, hate being in them. Checked my gallery. \n\nThere are hundreds of videos. I’m talking hours of them. \n\nAll recent.   \nAll filmed with the front-facing camera.   \nAll of me. \n\nJust walking. Long stretches of nothing—quiet suburban streets, grassy reserves, the shoulder of a dark highway. And there I am, in frame the whole time, my own face staring back at the camera like I’m vlogging some existential crisis I can’t be arsed to narrate. No talking. Barely blinking. Just walking , all alone, and filming myself. \n\nSometimes there’s a glint in my eye—like recognition. Like I’m listening to something. At times, I smile.\n\nAnd here’s the odd part. If you scrub through the footage slowly—frame by frame—you start to see things. Not often. But they’re there. \n\nA shadow moving behind me in a place where there’s no light. A reflection in a window that doesn’t match my movements.  \n\nAnd once—just once—you can see a shape behind me. In the distance. Far back. Like a tall man. Or not a man. Wearing something like a coat, but not quite right. Too long. Too thin. Arms down at its sides like they’re waiting to be used. You scrub too fast, and it’s gone. \n\nAbout two weeks ago, I called Mum. \n\nWe don’t really talk. Not because she’s a bad person—she’s not, exactly. Not a good one either. Just someone wired entirely different to me. Her brand of love is the tough kind. If there’s softness in her, it’s buried deep beneath decades of not having the time or permission to show it. \n\nAnyway, I recorded our call. I had a feeling I might need to refer back to it. What follows is the exact transcription. Word for word. \n\nSetting the scene: she’d just spent a solid ten minutes unloading about Annee (my sister) getting sacked from her hairdressing apprenticeship—*“too soft, too slow, never had the follow-through”*—and I finally steered the conversation where I needed it to go. \n\n>**Me:** Mum, I’m sorry but I gotta talk about about dad for a bit. \n\n>**Mum:** Why would you wanna do that?\n\n>**Me:** I’m starting to sleepwalk. \n\n>*She went real quiet for a moment. Sorry, I’m editorialising.* \n\n>**Mum:** Jesus. \n\n>**Me:** I’m getting it checked out. \n\n>**Mum:** Yeah?  \n\n>**Me:** Yeah. \n\n>**Mum:** Between you and your brother— \n\n>**Me:** Hang on, what? *‘S’* had this, too? \n\n>**Mum:** Of course. You don’t remember him walking into your room some nights? Scared the absolute shit outta you— \n\n>**Me**: I was too young to remember, I guess. \n\n>**Mum:** Well, he did. Him and your father, both. \n\n>**Me:** Anyone else? \n\n>**Mum:** <silence> \n\n>**Me:** Please, mum, anyone else? \n\n>**Mum:** <silence> \n\n>**Me:** Mum— \n\n>**Mum:** I don’t want you jumping to any conclusions. \n\n>**Me:** I’m not gonna, but did others have this? \n\n>**Mum:** <silence> \n\n>**Me:** Did Uncle Andrew sleepwalk? Did his sons—the dead ones, what’re their names—Brayden, William—did they sleepwalk, too? \n\n>**Mum:** Yes. \n\n>**Me:** Jesus. Jesus Christ. And you never connected the dots—? \n\n>**Mum:** Connected what, *‘R’?* What is there to fuckin’ connect, I mean *really*. That sickness runs through the veins of the men in this family? Everyone knows that. It’s a shit hand you’ve been dealt, pet, but you’ve got a good head on your shoulders and you’ve not been getting any bad thoughts? \n\n>**Me:** I don’t want to kill myself, if that’s what you mean. \n\n>**Mum:** There you go, already a step beyond the rest. \n\n>**Me:** What bad thoughts, though? Did dad, did *‘S’* ever say— \n\n>**Mum:** I don’t wanna talk about this, *R.* \n\n>**Me:** Well, mum, I do ‘cause I’m pretty fuckin’ scared— \n\n>**Mum:** Don’t use that fucking tone with me. I don’t want you going off and looking into this stupid shit like your brother did, because diseased minds will cling to whatever conspiracy they can find, R, and I’m done fuckin’ burying my boys— \n\n>**Me:** What stuff? Did you say *‘S’* was— \n\nShe hung up on me after that. Texted me a couple minutes later that she loved me, but that I’d upset her, and she was going for a lie down.  \n\nWeird, right? And she’s let trip that my brother, who killed himself in his early twenties when I was fourteen, had been looking into it. Which suggested there was *something* to look into. \n\nSo, I spent the next few days tracking down my aunt, and the widows of my two deceased cousins. Mum apparently got to my aunt first, she was tight lipped and told me I’d only make myself more crook by filling my head with crazy ideas—but the widows were more forthcoming, perhaps without any of that generational loyalty to hold them back. \n\nThe stories were almost identical. Same pattern. First came the sleepwalking. Then came the filming. Both Brayden and William had hours of footage—just like mine. Shaky, low-light videos of themselves wandering aimlessly through the night, flash on, eyes reduced to glowing white orbs devoid of pupils, mouths slack.  \n\nNow, hereditary sleepwalking? Sure. I’ll bite. Maybe it runs in families. Some weird quirk in the brain. You could probably dig up a journal article or two, slap a name on it, call it benign. \n\nBut the filming? What element of your DNA is supposed to teach you to *pick up a phone and point it at your own face while unconscious?* That’s not muscle memory. That’s not evolution. That’s something else. \n\nAnd there was another thing. \n\nNeither Brayden nor William ever left town. They lived at home until the end. So when they sleepwalked, they always ended up in the same place: the *Carbanak Resources Iron Mine.*  \n\nEvery single time. \n\nThat stuck with me. Got me wondering. \n\nSo I pulled up Google Maps and started plotting out my own movements—every time my phone had recorded a walk, every midnight stroll I didn’t remember. I marked them all, measured headings, compared directions, laid them one over the other. \n\nEvery single path pointed the same way. Not close. Not approximately. Exactly. Same vector. Same bearing.\n\nDraw a straight line across the continent along that heading and you know where it lands? \n\nDead centre of the *Carbanak Iron Mine.* \n\nThousands of kilometres away. \n\nAnd somehow, without ever having been there, without ever seeing the place properly in my life, I’ve been trying to walk there in my sleep. \n\nTell me how the fuck that’s supposed to be genetic. \n\nI asked the widows if they remembered anything else—any other signs, any other oddities. They hesitated at first, like they weren’t sure what counted, or maybe they’d spent so long trying to forget that dredging it back up felt wrong. \n\nBut then the memories started to surface. \n\nThey both said the same thing: their husbands hated being photographed. Not just camera shy—*hated it.* Something about the act itself would set them off. Brayden once smacked the phone out of his wife’s hand at their daughter’s third birthday. She was trying to film him singing over the cake. One second, he was fine, the next he was snarling, eyes wide, like she’d just shone a torch in the face of something buried deep underground. The phone shattered on the tiles. The kid started crying. \n\nWilliam, apparently, went even further. He smashed every phone in the house. Every single one. Said they were watching him. Wouldn’t say who “they” were. Refused to buy his wife—then a stay-at-home mother—a replacement.\n\nBut the part that really stuck with me—William’s daughter, a little older by then, told her mum one day that her Polaroid camera had gone missing. Few days later, William found it in his own wardrobe. Inside, in an old shoebox, were hundreds of Polaroids. Hundreds. Crammed in like he was hoarding them. \n\nAlmost all of them were photos of William. \n\nUnflattering angles. Off-centre, held at arms length.\n\nThe widow said she asked him—had he taken them? Were they some kind of weird art project or surveillance thing? \n\nBut William looked like he was about to throw up. Not angry, not embarrassed. Scared. She said he acted like someone had broken into their home and left a box of photos behind. Like he couldn’t remember a single one. Like they weren’t his at all. \n\nBrayden never found anything like that, but he did say something once—just once, in a moment of clarity his wife said didn’t happen often by the end. They were talking about his dad, and his granddad before him. Both gone, both suicides. And Brayden had this far-off look in his eyes when he muttered it. \n\n“He was the first, you know. My granddad. The first in our line to do it.” \n\nShe asked if he meant suicide. Brayden had said yes. Then added: \n\n‘Shouldn’t have taken that photo. Took the equipment down special. First time any of them had ever seen a camera, you know, or whatever they called it back then.’ Then he repeated: 'Shouldn't have taken that photo.' \n\nThen she asked what he meant, he said: \n\n‘Of that thing. Deep in the mines.’ \n\nHe never said more after that. It was the first and last time he ever brought it up. \n\nA week later, he was gone too. \n\nAnd of course—how had I not put it together sooner?\n\nMy dad hated having his picture taken, too. \n\nThere was this one time—I must’ve been seven, maybe eight. Won a disposable camera in some end-of-term raffle at school. Came home waving it around like a trophy. Dad walked through the door and I—just being a little idiot revved up on adrenalin—called out “smile, dad!” and clicked the shutter. \n\nHe punched me in the mouth. \n\nSplit my lip clean open. Camera went flying, smashed to bits on the kitchen tiles. I didn’t even cry—just stared at him, stunned. And he grabbed me by the shoulders, eyes wild, and snarled right into my face: “Never take a fuckin’ photo of me. *Ever* again.” \n\nI’d buried that one. Deep. One of a hundred little unpleasantries I’d filed away under normal childhood bullshit. But it came roaring back as soon as the widows started talking. \n\nAnd there was another thing—worse, somehow, because it had been good before it turned bad. \n\nFlash forward a couple years later. Camcorders were becoming more common. I wanted one so badly. I begged for weeks. Dad was reluctant—shifty, even—but eventually, he caved. Bought one second-hand from a guy at work. \n\nThat summer? That was maybe the happiest I remember him. Us. We took a road trip down south, just the two of us. Stayed in dodgy motels. Ate crap food. Filmed everything. Goofy little scenes. Me doing dumb voices. Him pretending to narrate like a documentary host. It was golden. He was golden.  \n\nAnd then we got home. \n\nWe sat down to watch the tapes. First one played fine. Second one, too. And then—somewhere in the third—he went completely still. \n\nI remember the way his jaw slackened. Like something in the footage had reached out and touched him. Like he’d seen a face in the static. \n\nThen he lost it. \n\nSmashed the TV. Ripped the camcorder out of the wall and hurled it across the room. Tore the tapes apart with his bare hands. I tried to stop him, tried to ask what was wrong, and he just kept muttering “no, no, no, no” like a prayer. Like maybe if he said it enough times, whatever he’d seen would un-happen. \n\nWe never talked about it. Not once. He acted like the whole summer hadn’t even happened. Like the trip was just some weird dream we both shared and forgot at the same time. \n\nBut I think about it now, and I wonder—what are videos, really? \n\nA million photographs. One after another. Frame by frame by frame. \n\nLook—I know how this sounds. \n\nI do. \n\nMaybe it’s just a genetic thing. A curse passed down in blood and synapses. Some cracked family line of sleepwalkers with delusions of grandeur. Maybe we’re just born sick, and the sickness makes us search for patterns that aren’t there. \n\nBut I’ve been thinking about filming myself. Properly. Just sitting down, facing the lens, and letting it run through the night. No walking. No GPS. Just me, and the dark, and the eye of the camera. See if it catches anything. See if it sees me. \n\nProblem is—I’m scared. \n\nAnd not just regular scared. It’s something else. I don’t know how to explain it, but the more videos I take, the more photos I find on my phone in the mornings, the longer the blackouts seem to last. Like something’s reaching through them, pulling time out of me. And the strangest part is, every time I wake up, I feel this deep, aching pull to go home. \n\nSo yeah. That’s why I’m posting here. \n\nIf anyone’s heard of something like this—sleepwalking, recurring directional impulses, hereditary aversion to being seen on film—I’d really appreciate anything. Articles. Journals. Even just stories. I’ll take anything at this point. \n\nBecause here’s the crazy part. The bit I haven’t told anyone yet: \n\nLately, I’ve been thinking about going back. Back to Carbanak. Not just to visit. To work. I’ve looked into it. There are job listings. Open positions. Labour shortages. It wouldn’t be hard. \n\nAnd I know it sounds insane—I know—but something about it feels *right*. There's this pull, navel-deep, and getting stronger every day.\n\nCommon sense tells me it's just my mining roots flaring up after a long haitus, my blood wanting to follow family tradition.\n\nOnly a little part of me is worried it's not really *me* that wants to go back at all."},"90":{"title":"I was Solicited While Abroad, and Now my Memory is Unravelling [PART 2] [FINAL]","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k7z8pk\/i_was_solicited_while_abroad_and_now_my_memory_is\/","flair":"Series","author":"Twhylight","selftext":"[PART 1](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k6pcak\/i\\_was\\_solicited\\_while\\_abroad\\_and\\_now\\_my\\_memory\\_is\/)\n\nThe rest of the trip blurred into a monotonous haze of dull landscapes and forgettable architecture. Besides the boredom I felt, Will’s enthusiasm, once a familiar backdrop to our lives, now grated on every fiber of my being. I could hardly look at him without feeling a surge of irritation. It wasn’t just his voice or the way he never stopped talking. It was everything about him—the way he strutted through crowds, a charmer at the center of attention, as if the entire world revolved around his smile. He wasn’t just annoying. He was suffocating.\n\nEverywhere we went, he wielded his charm like a weapon, ensnaring another desperate local in his web. A laugh here, a wink there, and suddenly another conversation blossomed, another person in his thrall. I loathed it. The friendly gestures, the casual jokes, always twisted into something predatory, something crude. His eyes, always scanning, calculating, sizing up everyone around him like they were all just potential marks. Each glance, each flick of his tongue against his teeth, felt like an invasion.\n\nI couldn’t stand it.\n\nBetween us he stopped cracking his jokes and filling the silence with stupid anecdotes. Something widened between us, with the words neither of us was willing to say. I couldn’t even bring myself to pretend anymore. The silence was deafening. He must have noticed, of course. He wasn’t stupid. But even when the joking stopped, the mask didn’t fall. Will was still Will—too busy charming everyone else to care that I was no longer amused, no longer interested.\n\nBy the time our flight home arrived, I was relieved to be leaving.\n\nThe only thing that had kept me sane during those days was her. Sable.\n\nHer messages felt right—the one thing that gave me momentum. A cheeky text, arriving like clockwork, would send a jolt through my veins. I’d lie in bed, staring at the black rectangle on my bedside stand, waiting. Anticipating. The inevitable buzz. The vibration. The flicker of movement in the darkness. The rush of blood, the sharp thrill of reading her words.\n\nWe would talk. I’d click the pay link. The images would flow. My mind would race. And I would be left a twitching mess.\n\nWithout her, the world felt off. The streets stretched endlessly, buildings almost bending at odd angles, each blending into the next, indistinct and unnatural. Conversations faded into static, just lips moving without meaning. The air felt sickening, pressing in around me like invisible hands.\n\nThere was the only thing that mattered. Only one thing that felt real.\n\n**Buzz.**\n\nA jolt. A sharp, electric rush. My fingers twitched toward the phone.\n\n**Buzz.**\n\nFluorescent lights. The hum of computers. Papers rustling.\n\nI blink. I’m at my desk, back at work.\n\nA dull headache pulses at the base of my skull. The artificial lights overhead burn too bright, reflecting off polished desks and glass partitions. The office smells of reheated coffee and old paper.\n\n*“Sam, did you hear me?”*\n\nA voice cuts through the fog. I turn, my movements sluggish, my mind struggling to catch up.\n\nA desk is cluttered with case files. My tie feels too tight, a noose around my throat. The nameplate on my desk reads Samuel Grant, Associate. A familiar weight settles in my chest. \n\nWill stands across from me, expectant. His voice is just noise, muffled and distant, as if he’s speaking through water. I nod absently, hoping it’s the right response. He exhales sharply, shaking his head. Disgust? Frustration? I can’t make sense of his expression.\n\n**Buzz.**\n\nA message.\n\n**“*****Lievard*****.”**\n\n**“Yes.”**\n\nI pay, and the image she sends fills my very essence. Her fingers curl around the stem of a wine glass, nails painted deep crimson, pressing just hard enough to leave a mark. The rich liquid clings to the sides, swirling lazily, as if waiting. I swear I can smell it—dark, heady, intoxicating. There’s nothing explicit about it but still my breath quickens. My skin tingles, a rush of pleasure. \n\nI click the PayPal link again.\n\n—\n\nThe city is empty tonight.\n\nNot in the literal sense—people still move along the sidewalks, headlights carve through the dark, neon hums against wet pavement—but it all feels hollow. Distant. Like I’m walking through a painting, the brushstrokes unfinished, the colors smudged.\n\nI move forward on autopilot, my footsteps lost beneath the murmur of life happening around me. Voices blur. Laughter rings sharp, too bright, too false. A couple passes by, hands entwined, their bodies leaning into each other in a way that makes my stomach twist.\n\nI shove my hands into my coat pockets and keep walking.\n\nThe streetlights flicker overhead, and for a brief moment, my shadow stretches long against the pavement. \n\nA shape in my peripheral vision.\n\nMy breath catches.\n\n*Sable*.\n\nShe’s across the street, poised beneath the glow of a shopfront. A glass of red wine in her hand. Dark dress clinging to every curve, her lips painted deep crimson. A vision of quiet power. A promise.\n\nShe tilts her head as if she knows I’m looking.\n\nThe air is suddenly thick, the scent of jasmine and rain-damp concrete clogging my lungs. A tone rushes through me like a pulse of pleasure.\n\nAnd she’s gone.\n\nOnly strangers. A man checking his watch. A woman adjusting her coat. A bus rolling past, its brakes hissing.\n\nThe buzz in my pocket jolts me, a sudden spark to my system. I exhale sharply, pressing my hand against my chest, trying to steady the erratic beat beneath my ribs.\n\nI pull out my phone.\n\n**“Thinking of me,** ***Lievard***\\*\\*?”\\*\\*\n\nMy fingers tighten around the device.\n\n**“Always.”**\n\n**Buzz.**\n\nA courtroom. Dark wood panels. Rows of blank faces. The judge’s voice drones on—an endless monotone, stretching and folding over itself, like waves eroding a distant shore.\n\nI’m standing, speaking. The words leave my mouth in measured, practised sentences, automatic. Am I saying the right things?\n\nA bead of sweat slips down my spine. My pulse is slow, sluggish.\n\n“Sam!”\n\nWill, again.\n\nI’m at my desk. A case file sits in front of me, untouched.\n\n“What?” I mutter.\n\n“I needed those case notes yesterday!” He looms over me, frustration radiating off him.\n\nI slide the files across without looking up. “They’re here.” I haven’t touched them. I know it. He knows it.\n\nWill snatches them, I expected anger but saw disappointment. “Fuck, Sam. I gotta do everything now.”\n\nI should argue. I do feel a surge of anger. I should defend myself. But I don’t have the energy. I let it slide. Again.\n\nWill slinks off. Silence settles in, thick and suffocating.\n\nThe only sound I truly hear is the blood rushing in my ears.\n\n**Buzz.**\n\nThe city sprawls beyond my window, lights flickering like distant stars. The night presses in against the glass, cold.\n\nI catch my reflection—hollow eyes, drawn features. My clothes don’t seem to fit me anymore. When did I last change shirts? My tie lies forgotten, my buttons mismatched lining my body.\n\nOn the bedside table, my phone sits motionless. \n\nI reach for it. Fingers hovering.\n\nWhat am I doing?\n\n**Buzz.**\n\nThe world sharpens.\n\nA deep breath. The tension in my chest uncoils, my shoulders loosening, as if I’ve been holding something in for hours. Maybe I have.\n\nMy thumb hovers over the screen.\n\nA small, involuntary smile as I read her words.\n\n**“Ready,** ***Lievard***\\*\\*?”\\*\\*\n\n**“Always, love.”**\n\n**“Your payments have slowed. Is something wrong?”**\n\n**“Work has slowed down. I can’t bring myself to do it…”**\n\nA pause. The dots bounce.\n\n**“Do it for me,** ***Lievard***\\*\\*.”\\*\\*\n\nI look to her name in my contacts. \n\n**Mistress Sable.**\n\n**“Yes, mistress.”**\n\n—\n\nI was let go. When? How? The days are all a blur, tangled and slipping through my fingers. Did I even pack? Did I say goodbye? The memory is fractured, distant. I recall vague flashes-Will’s voice, his pleading, his insistence that I stay and keep working. But none of it sticks. I recall an urge to escape… it was overpowering. The office, the files, the sterile lights. I was suffocating. I needed out.\n\nAs I left, I thought I saw *her*\\-watching me from the lobby. Just a fleeting glimpse, her silhouette framed by the glass doors. Her in her midnight gown, voluptuous chest heaving with her breath as I approach. Her black hair along her sleek collarbone begging to be played with. But when I turned, she was gone.\n\n**Buzz.**\n\nI sit in my apartment, surrounded by chaos—documents scattered like confetti, my laptop blinking at me from the desk with an almost mocking persistence. The light from the screen feels like a spotlight, searing into my skull. It’s too bright—everything is too bright—and I can’t seem to focus on anything. The emails, the notices, all of them blurring into an unintelligible mess.\n\n**Buzz.**\n\nThe vibration is sudden, sharp. I whip my phone off the desk, my hands shaking as I swipe it open. The notification stares back at me, a cold slap to my already frayed nerves.\n\nIt’s a notification from my bank.\n\n*Insufficient funds.*\n\nI stare at the message, uncomprehending. When did that happen? I had a nest egg, a comfortable cushion left from my European trip. It didn’t make sense.\n\nI quickly check the accounts. My main account is in the negative. My savers hold only a small amount. But then my eyes drift to the list of transactions—each one pulls funds day after day, one after another, steadily draining the account.\n\nAll by me. But I don’t remember making them.\n\nI close my eyes, as if that might clear my head.\n\nWhen? How?\n\n**Buzz.**\n\nThe sudden sound rips through me like a jolt of electricity. My mind freezes, my body locked in place, but I can’t ignore it. The phone buzzes again, more insistent now.\n\nI look at the screen.\n\n**“It’s time,** ***Lievard***\\*\\*.”\\*\\*\n\nI sit on the edge of my bed, phone in hand, the dim light from the screen casting an unnatural glow across my face. Trembling, I wait for a moment for her to continue, but nothing happens. My fingers hover over the keys.\n\n**“Mistress, I need you.”**\n\nMy pulse quickens as I hit send. The anticipation coils tight in my chest, knotting painfully. I don’t even try to distract myself anymore. I’m fixated. Waiting. My entire world shrinks down to the tiny rectangle of the phone screen.\n\nI stare at my message. The tiny, bouncing dots that are supposed to mean she’s typing don’t appear. Had she read it? Time crawls. I glance at the clock. Ten minutes. Then twenty. I know she’s busy, but… she always responds.\n\nMaybe she’s tired. Maybe she’s dealing with something else. No, she wouldn’t be with someone else.\n\nI text again:\n\n**“Mistress, I’m begging you.”**\n\nNo response.\n\nI set the phone down, sitting back on the bed, and let out a long, shaky breath. I want to throw up. My chest tightens.\n\nI wait.\n\nAnd wait.\n\nNothing.\n\n**Buzz.**\n\nI pick the phone up again.\n\n**“I’m busy.”**\n\nI read the words over and over, but they don’t make sense. She was ready for me now she isn’t? She’s always made time for me before. She’s always understood.\n\nI send a quick reply:\n\n**“But I need you now. This can’t wait.”**\n\nMy heart beats faster as I wait, staring at the screen.\n\n**“You know the answer, Lievard.”**\n\nThe coldness in her words cuts through the air, sharper than I expected. Yet, with the sense of rising panic, a loving embrace awaited me. I exhaled slowly, the tightness in my chest releasing as I pull up PayPal.\n\nI send through the payment.\n\n—\n\nI woke again, lying on my bed, my mind stale with remnants of sleep. I felt disgusting. A cold shiver ran through me, like the final collapse of a crumbling foundation.\n\nI opened my bank app once more, and there it was—everything gone. My finances, ruined. I had nothing left.\n\nSick to my stomach, I rushed to the bathroom, barely making it to the toilet before I threw up. The thought hit me like a freight train: I did this. I couldn’t remember when or for how long, but I spent it all. Every last cent.\n\nThe sensation of everything unraveling washed over me. I needed to talk to someone. I needed help.\n\nI grabbed my phone, fingers trembling, and for the first time in what felt like forever, I reached out to someone else.\n\nThe phone rang. A beat of silence. Then, Will’s voice.\n\n*“Sam?”*\n\nI froze, the lump in my throat too large to swallow. Tears welled up before I could stop them. “Will… I need help…”\n\n*“Fuck, Sam. It’s been months.”*\n\nI let that slip by, the sense of time slipping away from me. “Can we meet? Please? Maybe at your place? I need to get out of here.”\n\nThere was a long pause, his breath deepening as he considered it.\n\n*“Sam, you stopped talking to me. You ignored me at work, and then you ghosted me after you got fired. Why the hell would I meet you now?”*\n\n“B-because you’re my friend…”\n\nThe words barely escaped, and I couldn’t stop the tears from falling. I sniffed them back, hoping I wouldn’t break. Then, I heard a sigh on the other end.\n\n*“Okay, fine. I’ve got something in a few hours, but you can come over. We’ll talk. But you gotta leave after, okay?”*\n\nI swallowed hard, grateful. “Okay. I’ll see you soon.”\n\n*“Yeah.”*\n\nThe line clicked dead.\n\nI sat there for a while, staring at the mess around me: the dirty apartment, the ruined bank account and finally my messages. I wanted to feel that warmth again. \n\nEventually, I forced myself up and made my way out of the building, my head spinning with thoughts I couldn’t quite put together.\n\n—\n\nEventually, I made it to Will’s apartment. I stood at the entrance, barely holding myself together in my disheveled clothes and long jacket. I must have looked terrible—like an I'll fitting skin suit on an alien. My hair unkempt, my face pale, and the weight of it all pressing down on me with each breath I took. I knocked on the door, probably a little too hard.\n\nNo answer.\n\nI knocked again, harder this time, frustration building in my being.\n\nThen I heard it. A sound—was it laughter? No, it couldn’t be. I thought I was imagining it. But then it stopped, just as quickly as it had started. A pit formed in my stomach, a sinking feeling like something was off. I raised my hand to knock again when Will suddenly opened the door, just enough to look through the crack.\n\nHe was flushed, panting, naked. Nothing but a towel.\n\nMy breath caught in my throat.\n\n“Will. What the hell?” \n\nHis gaze locked onto mine, and his eyes were dark with something I couldn’t place. He was angry—no, furious.\n\n“I waited for you! You didn’t show up, so I moved on. You ghosted me again!”\n\nMy brain struggled to process his words. I opened my mouth, but no sound came out at first. The anger I felt-the betrayal-began to boil over. How dare he accuse me of ghosting him? After everything? I had shown up. I had come here, expecting to find my friend, not… this.\n\n“What do you mean?! I came straight here!”\n\nWill let the door swing open fully, taking in my appearance. I could see the judgment in his eyes, the disgust as he looked me over. The pity I had once seen in him, that faint trace of empathy, evaporated in an instant.\n\n“I gave you *so* many chances, and you threw them all away.” His words were laced with venom.\n\nI could feel the anger rising, my pulse hammering in my ears. “Like hell—” I began, but the words caught in my throat. \n\n*“Babe?”* A voice called from inside.\n\nA voice I knew.\n\nMy stomach churned, my heart clenched.\n\n*“Who’s that?”* she asked, her voice full of innocence.\n\nEverything suddenly clicked into place. I saw what Will was. A snake, who wanted to see me suffer. I felt the floor drop out from under me, like I was falling through an endless void. I should have known. I should have seen it sooner. Will wasn’t my friend—he never had been. This whole time, he’d been playing me, stringing me along, feeding me scraps of affection while he moved on behind my back. To get to *her*.\n\nI felt the anger, the hurt, surge inside me. I couldn’t keep it in anymore. I felt the urge to fight back. I shouldn’t have let him do this to me. I shouldn’t have let myself get this low.\n\nThe alien weight in my jacket tugged at me, its purpose suddenly clear. I reached for it, the cold metal a sharp contrast to the heat in my veins. My fingers closed around the handle, and I felt a sense of control, of power I hadn’t felt in so long. I wasn’t going to let him get away with this.\n\nThe words spilled out of my mouth, raw and vicious. “You *fucking* asshole.”\n\nI fired the handgun. Once. Twice. Three times.\n\nWill collapsed to the ground, blood pooling beneath him. Dead.\n\nThe screaming came next.\n\nThe woman emerged from the room, cradling Will’s bleeding body. Her eyes locked onto mine, wide with terror, blonde hair plastered to her face. Blonde.\n\nIt’s not Sable.\n\nI froze, the grip on the gun—when had I even gotten it?—tightening in my hand. My mind spun, struggling to process what had just happened. Without thinking, I threw the weapon to the floor and stumbled backward, my pulse racing.\n\nIt *wasn’t* Sable.\n\nHer sobs reverberated down the hallway as I turned and fled for the elevator, my heart pounding in my chest. My fingers fumbled with my phone, shaking as I typed out the message.\n\n**“Mistress, I thought it was you.”**\n\nThe elevator creaked and groaned as it moved, agonizingly slow.\n\n**“I killed him for you.”**\n\nThe doors seemed to take forever to open.\n\n**“Sable. Please.”**\n\nI could feel panic creeping into my bones, gnawing at my resolve. I had to reach her. I had to explain.\n\nWithout thinking, I threw caution to the wind. I selected her name from my contacts and pressed call.\n\n*‘We’re sorry, the number you have dialled is disconnected.’*"},"91":{"title":"I took a wrong turn and ended up exactly where i needed to be","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k75vsx\/i_took_a_wrong_turn_and_ended_up_exactly_where_i\/","flair":null,"author":"AndroGhost","selftext":"Some roads feel like they remember you better than people do.\n\nWe were driving back late. Me, my girlfriend asleep next to me, and Havana, our 2.5-year-old dog, curled up on the passenger side like she owned it. The air was cool. The sky was moonless. The kind of night where the world seems to shrink down to just your headlights and your thoughts.\n\nThe GPS had rerouted us off the main road to avoid traffic. I took the turn without thinking. But once we were a few kilometers in, it started to feel like the road had taken me.\n\nThere was nothing memorable about it visually. Flat. Straight. Just trees on either side and the kind of quiet that gets under your skin. But something about it started pressing on a part of me I hadn’t felt in a long time. A pressure behind the ribs. A heaviness that wasn’t about tiredness.\n\nThat’s when I saw someone up ahead.\n\nA man on the side of the road. Not waving. Not panicked. Just standing there. Calm.\n\nI slowed down, and as the lights caught his face, I nearly forgot to breathe.\n\n“Marko?”\n\nHe smiled.\n\n“Hey, Petar.”\n\nI pulled over, gravel crunching beneath the tires. Havana perked her ears but didn’t growl. Just looked at him like he belonged there.\n\nI got out.\n\nMarko looked older. Like me. But his posture was the same, relaxed but alert. He always had this way of noticing everything without needing to talk about it. I hadn’t seen him since we were maybe eleven.\n\nHe was never the loud kind of friend. We didn’t climb trees or build forts or throw water balloons at girls. We just talked. In hallways. On slow walks after school. We’d found each other because neither of us liked pretending to be interested in the things everyone else seemed obsessed with.\n\nI never played with LEGO. He didn’t play soccer. We found connection in the quiet places between everything.\n\nAnd this road, this one exactly, was where we used to walk together. After school, before the streetlights came on. It cut behind the newer blocks and curved near an old train yard that doesn’t exist anymore. We used to sit on a cracked bench back there and talk about things that felt too big to say out loud anywhere else. Like where we’d be in twenty years. Like whether anyone would still remember us. Like what it meant to feel invisible even when surrounded by people.\n\nAnd then one day, he was just gone.\n\nNo explanation. No warning. He didn’t move away in the way that kids usually do, with boxes and teary goodbyes. He just disappeared. Empty seat in class. No forwarding address. I asked once, maybe twice, but no one had answers. And I didn’t push. I just... let him vanish.\n\nNow here he was, on this road again, like no time had passed.\n\n“I never got to say goodbye,” he said.\n\nHis voice hadn’t changed. Still soft, still grounded. He looked toward the road, like it was familiar too.\n\n“I didn’t even know you’d left,” I said.\n\n“I know,” he said. “But you remembered this road.”\n\n“I didn’t mean to.”\n\n“But something in you did. You came back when you needed to. That’s what this place was always for.”\n\nI didn’t understand what he meant, not fully. Not yet.\n\nBut he kept going.\n\n“You used to talk to me when no one else did. You let me be quiet without making me feel wrong for it. You asked real questions. And when my life was going to hell, you didn’t even know it—but you gave me a place to be safe.”\n\nI looked away. That lump in my throat was back.\n\n“You helped me carry something I didn’t have words for back then. Now I’m here to return the favor.”\n\nI laughed, not because it was funny, but because I didn’t know what to do with the ache in my chest.\n\n“I’m fine,” I said automatically.\n\n“No,” he said gently. “You’re functional.”\n\nHe looked at me like I’d said something untrue about my own body. Like he saw the scaffolding inside me for what it really was.\n\n“You’ve been unraveling slowly for a while,” he said. “You show up. You get the work done. You hold conversations. But inside, you're bone-tired. Worn down by the pressure to keep it together. And no one sees it. Not the way I do.”\n\nI didn’t answer. Because he wasn’t wrong.\n\nI’d been going through the motions. Delivering on expectations. Solving problems. Nodding along in meetings. But something deeper had been leaking out of me. Something I hadn’t told anyone about. That feeling like the floor could give out any second. That brittle edge just beneath the surface of every task, every social obligation, every smile.\n\n“You’ve convinced everyone you’re okay,” he said. “Even her.”\n\nHe gestured toward the car.\n\n“But you’re not.”\n\nI felt something hot building behind my eyes.\n\nThen he glanced at the passenger seat.\n\n“She knows, though,” he said, nodding at Havana.\n\n“She’s keeping you tethered. Every day. You think she’s just a good companion, but she’s more than that. She pulls you out of the fog. Reminds you there’s joy and safety, even in tiny moments.”\n\nI looked at her through the window. She was watching me. Tail tapping once, then still. Like she understood every word.\n\n“You’ve got more strength than you give yourself credit for,” he said. “But strength isn’t the same as not needing help.”\n\n“I don’t know what to do,” I said quietly.\n\n“You don’t need to do anything tonight. Just feel it. Let yourself stop pretending for once. That’s why I’m here.”\n\nHe looked back down the road, and for the first time I realized something. He didn’t look like someone visiting.\n\nHe looked like someone returning home.\n\n“You came back now because you knew I was close to breaking.”\n\nHe nodded.\n\n“This was our place. You were most you here. Before you learned to hide. I figured maybe if you came back... you'd remember how to come back to yourself.”\n\nI took a step forward, but he was already backing away. Not vanishing. Not disappearing. Just walking into the dark, like someone leaving a room that wasn’t theirs to stay in.\n\nI watched until I couldn’t anymore.\n\nThen I got into the car.\n\nMy girlfriend stirred and squeezed my hand, still half asleep. Havana leaned gently against my leg with that quiet, solid love that doesn’t ask questions.\n\nWe drove.\n\nThe road didn’t feel hollow anymore. Just quiet. Real. Steady.\n\nI don’t know what Marko was. Memory, ghost, guardian. All I know is that I needed him—and somehow, he knew exactly where to find me.\n\nThat’s the thing about the right kind of friendship. Even when time and distance tear it from the surface, something underneath remembers. A hidden map. A place.\n\nHe came back to remind me I’m not alone in this. That I never really was.\n\nAnd that sometimes, saving someone doesn’t look like a grand act.\n\nSometimes, it looks like showing up on the side of the road, right when the silence gets too loud."},"92":{"title":"Candle Wax [Final]","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k7px4o\/candle_wax_final\/","flair":"Series","author":"ChickenJeff","selftext":"[First](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1jz1md1\/candle_wax_part_1\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) | [Previous](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k6wmn4\/candle_wax_part_8\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\n\n\n“So, let me see if I got this right...” Gray began as we drove down the dark road. “Cult from the 80s kills some kids with hot wax as part of an unsuccessful satanic ritual. Harmony’s pops and this priest get way into that business. Dude has a kid and they make her drink goat’s blood from the fuckin’ holy grail to make her special, whatever that means. And then they have her play some kid’s game that they made up in order to turn her into some kind of demon zombie slave so she can do the ritual properly. And she... astral... projects... herself into your dreams to try and help you stop them.”\n\n \n\n“Or something like that.” I responded.\n\n \n\n“Well when you put it like that it’s all very fucking rational. And you DON’T want backup?”\n\n \n\n“This isn’t gonna be a fire fight, Gray. Backup will only complicate things. I’d go alone if I could.”\n\n \n\n“Yeah that ain’t happening.”\n\n \n\n“I didn’t think so. You’re far too stubborn.”\n\n \n\n“I’m the stubborn one, okay.” Gray said with biting sarcasm.\n\n \n\n“You are.” I asserted.\n\n \n\n“I think I have been pretty goddamn amenable through this process, all things considered.”\n\n \n\n“Okay, let me pick the song then.”\n\n \n\n“It’s my car, it’s my radio. Get some headphones if it bothers you.”\n\n \n\n“See?”\n\n \n\n“No that’s not stubborn, that’s just the rules of the road.”\n\n \n\n“It’s not a rule, you’re just a prick.”\n\n \n\n“It’s a rule, ask anyone.”\n\n \n\n“I was almost murdered, twice. I had thumbtacks in ALL of my holes... You won’t give me one song?”\n\n \n\n“You don’t get a song. We roll in your car, you can pick the songs. That’s how it works.”\n\n \n\n“Okay let’s roll in my car then.”\n\n \n\n“No, your car is a piece of shit.”\n\n \n\n“Unreal.”\n\n \n\nWe made a left and I could see the building coming into view. For a moment I almost forgot we were driving to the devil’s doorstep. Maybe that’s why a guy like Gray is good to have around.\n\n \n\nWe parked out front. The lights were off and the sign in the window said closed. “Blessings” loomed over us. The meaning of that word had corrupted.\n\n \n\n“Know how to pick a lock?” Gray asked.\n\n \n\n“I do actually.” I answered, producing some of the hair pins and bending them accordingly before jimmying them inside the lock. After a few moments, it clicked and the door opened easily.\n\n \n\n“We’re probably both gonna be fired for all this.” Gray said.\n\n \n\n“Probably... I imagine the pizza place would take you back though.”\n\n \n\nWe quietly made our way inside, guns drawn, past the small foyer and the rows of cafeteria seating. Seeing places like this so dark and empty never stops being unsettling. The absence of life where life should be.\n\n \n\nWe moved to the back area, into the kitchen. The most modern looking part of the building. We eventually came upon a door to a basement, tucked away in the very back. This was it.\n\n \n\nThe door was locked, but I made quick work of that. It opened into a dark, wooden staircase. Leading down into a blanket of blackness. I began to take a step down, but Gray stopped me.\n\n \n\n“Hold on.” He whispered. “Let me go first.”\n\n \n\n“Why? Why do you have to go first every time?”\n\n \n\n“Because I can be a human shield. Someone shoots me, you have time to get away. You’d be a terrible human shield, you’re like 50 pounds. Someone shoots you, it’ll rip through you like paper and kill us both.”\n\n \n\n“...Okay fine, whatever, go.”\n\n \n\nGray made his way down into the dark and I followed close behind. The steps creaked more than I wanted, but it seemed like no one was home. Or at least, no one was awake.\n\n \n\nGray held my shoulder as we walked into the pitch black void. I could only hear our breathing.\n\n \n\n“Flashlight?” He whispered to me.\n\n \n\n“Go.”\n\n \n\nGray clicked the flashlight on and it illuminated a dank, half furbished living space. The floor was grey concrete, and the ceiling was a patchwork of Styrofoam ceiling tiles. There was a small kitchenette, a bathroom, and a bachelor style living room\/bedroom combo. It confirmed that someone did indeed live here, but at a glance it didn’t confirm much else.\n\n \n\nConvinced that no one was here, we turned on the overhead light to get a better look and do some rummaging. For the overall grungy state of the place, whoever lived here did like to keep it tidy.\n\n \n\n“You think Harmony’s father lives here like this?” Gray asked.\n\n \n\nI shrugged. “I’ve lived in worse.”\n\n \n\n“Yeah, shit, I have too. I would have killed for a place like this in my teens.”\n\n \n\nMy eyes were eventually drawn to the desktop computer set-up in the corner. The first notable detail in this room.\n\n \n\n“Gray, take a look at this.” I said, motioning towards the desk.\n\n \n\n“Yeah that’s not bad, huh?”\n\n \n\n“Double monitors... and I’d wager that’s a thousand-dollar tower at least. Maybe two. Custom build.”\n\n \n\n“Most expensive thing here, no doubt.”\n\n \n\nI took a closer look inside the glass side of the PC. “I’m no expert, but that graphics card looks pretty monstrous... So either he’s one of those ‘PC Master Race’ guys, or he has a lot of visually intensive work to do here.”\n\n \n\n“I mean finding a good PC in a dingy basement isn’t exactly rare. This could realistically be anyone’s nephew living here.”\n\n \n\nI eagerly pressed enter on the keyboard and woke it up. I was faced with a basic looking lock screen, but not a familiar one. Maybe Linux. Nevertheless, it was password protected and the profile was unnamed.\n\n \n\nI tried a few basic passwords. ‘TheFather’. ‘CandleCaine’. Harmony’s date of birth. No dice.\n\n \n\n“Dead end then?” Gray asked.\n\n \n\n“No... This is it. This is our guy, and this is his fucking workstation.”\n\n \n\n“Look, I think you’re right... But he ain’t here, and Harmony ain’t here. It doesn’t look like any rituals were performed here either. I don’t see them conjuring Satan next to the goddamn pull out sofa.”\n\n \n\n“Well we have to find them! We have to find them now!”\n\n \n\n“I know, but what do you want me to do!?”\n\n \n\n“I don’t know... Okay... we wait for him to come back, and we force him to take us to her.”\n\n \n\n“Whitley died before giving us anything.”\n\n \n\n“Then so be it. If he doesn’t give us anything, I’ll kill him. One less piece of shit on the board.”\n\n \n\n“Jesus, Cole. Let’s not-“\n\n \n\nGray’s words were interrupted by the slow creaking of a door on the other side of the room. Both of our eyes widened, and we looked toward the sound.\n\n \n\nThere he was. Brad. Harmony’s father. Emerging from what looked like a hidden door amongst the wood paneling. He looked slightly different than the man I had seen on his social media, with a 5 o’clock shadow and cavernous dark circles under his eyes not hidden behind his thick brimmed glasses.\n\n \n\nHis expression mirrored ours. One of shock and dreadful anticipation. A tense second followed where none of us moved. I was first to draw my gun.\n\n \n\n“Hands above your head!” I shouted. Gray followed suit and pulled his weapon. Brad, to my bewilderment, frantically raised his hands.\n\n \n\n“Wait! Wait, wait, wait.” He said, appearing to cower. “You shouldn’t be here!”\n\n \n\n“What is that door? Where did you come from!?” Gray demanded.\n\n \n\n“Where’s Harmony!?” I yelled over him.\n\n \n\n“Okay, okay, okay. Just don’t shoot. Please.” Brad uttered meekly.\n\n \n\n“Get on the ground, and put your hands behind your back, right fucking now!” Gray said, and Brad quickly obliged. Gray cuffed him and then hoisted him to his feet.\n\n \n\n“What’s behind that door?” Gray asked again.\n\n \n\n“Don’t... Don’t... You shouldn’t...” He pleaded.\n\n \n\n“Take us back there, now.” I commanded.\n\n \n\n“I’m sorry, detective. I didn’t want this.” He said while looking directly at me. I saw the same eyes I saw behind that goat mask.\n\n \n\nI was taken aback and pissed off beyond belief. “Are you fucking kidding me? You didn’t want this? Look at me. I still taste the metal, you son of a bitch. You didn’t want that? No, I’ll tell you what you didn’t want. You didn’t want me to still be fucking breathing. But I am. So right now, you need to start giving me some damn good reasons why I shouldn’t put a bullet in your mouth.”\n\n \n\n“That wasn’t me!”\n\n \n\n“Bullshit. I saw you. I saw your eyes. Don’t play dumb with me. You raised your daughter to be part of a goddamn satanic ritual.”\n\n \n\n“I didn’t know what it was!” He whined. “Whitley... he was my friend. I didn’t know what he was doing to her. Not at first. But then he showed me things. Insane things. He told me she was special. That she was chosen. That the end was coming and she was the key to our survival. I... I believed him. So I helped him. I left everything and I moved in here. He said our work would keep her safe, and that when she was ready she would come back to us. She would resurrect The Father and he would save us from damnation.”\n\n \n\n“Oh that’s horseshit.” Gray said.\n\n \n\n“I know! It was all a lie! I know, because the thing that came back to us was not my daughter. It was something else... The apocalypse was bullshit, it was never about that. But it had already started. I didn’t know what to do. If I made a move, he would know. So I stayed close. Close to her. Hoping maybe I could get her back. I helped fake her videos. I helped buy time while they... prepared. I didn’t want to kill you, detective. I didn’t want to hurt anyone. But that’s what Harmony was for... That’s what they got wrong the first time.”\n\n \n\n“What did they get wrong? Who are they?”\n\n \n\n“The Cult of the Father. Whitley was obsessed. The cult, they... they wanted to find reality beyond reality. They believed that spiritualism was the way. All spiritualism. Religious iconography. They used satanic imagery, but they didn’t believe in Satan. They believe in... belief. They believe that if you broaden your mind, your spirit, your belief, you could open yourself up to higher beings. You could be touched. You could be visited. That’s why they used candles. Candles are used in all kinds of spiritual practices, they hold tremendous symbolic power. They spoke to their higher beings through candles. But that’s only half of the equation. They wanted more, but they didn’t know...”\n\n \n\n“Go on...” I said sternly, not releasing my grip on the gun.\n\n \n\n“They only thought about the spiritual side. But Whitley, he studied more. He found people who sought the same end through different means. Spiritual AND biological. Two sides of the same coin. He studied the work of Darren Barbeau. Supposedly he reached the higher reality through means of science, biology, even botany. So Whitley combined them. The Holy Father, and Mother Nature. The iconography of great holy chalices and goat’s blood, imbued with a brain altering drug cocktail, medicinally prescribed, until it could grow inside her like a seed.”\n\n \n\n“But what was it for?”\n\n \n\n“Everything. Once Whitley activated her with that stupid little game, the other side took hold. Her blood got added to the cocktail, and it was so much stronger than it was before. I told you I didn’t want to hurt you... but when you drink it... He only made me drink it a few times and that’s what I did, but more you take it, the longer it lingers.”\n\n \n\n“Whitley was dead before you tried to kill me. He didn’t make you drink anything.”\n\n \n\n“I didn’t mean Whitley... “\n\n \n\n“...What? Who do you mean then? Who’s ‘he’?”\n\n \n\nBrad lowered his head and held his tongue.\n\n \n\n“Tell me. Now. I’m in no fucking mood.”\n\n \n\nBrad let out a deep sigh and finally muttered, “Caine.”\n\n \n\n“Caine? The dead cult leader?”\n\n \n\n“Listen, I’ve told you everything... Please get me out of here. If he knows I talked...”\n\n \n\n“So he’s here then.”\n\n \n\n“That door leads to a sub-basement. Yes. He’s down there. With her. He’s feeding. It’s the only window we get. Please, we have to go. There’s nothing you can do here.”\n\n \n\n“No. We’re going down there, and you’re coming with us. And if you’re fucking with me about all this, I promise I will kill you.”\n\n \n\n“There’s nothing you can do! My daughter is gone! I tried! I tried so many times to reach her, but she’s not there anymore! If we go down there, he will kill us all!”\n\n \n\n“If we leave, he will never stop coming for us. You know that. No one will ever be safe.” I rebuked.\n\n \n\n“You’re making a mistake.”\n\n \n\n“Let’s go. And by the way, don’t think for one second you’re innocent in all this. If what you’re selling me is true, you knew and you did nothing. You could have stopped this. You could have fought. You’re a fucking coward.”\n\n \n\nBrad didn’t say another word, Gray held him by the arm as we opened the door and made a right to a steep, stone staircase. Orange light flickered at the bottom as we descended.\n\n \n\nWe turned another right at the bottom of the stairs and the sight before us was ungodly. A crude, stone shrine. Painstakingly carved arches in the walls, lined in gold paint. Adorned in a multitude of symbols, iconographies, and tapestries from many religions. Many of the same symbols we saw on those trees out in the woods. There was a perimeter of multiple levels of lit candles. At the back of the long, rectangular room, in the center, sat a big stone slab. An altar of some kind. What laid upon it was harder to describe.\n\n \n\nI recognized Harmony’s ghastly form. She laid on her back on the slab, adorned in a ghostly thin white gown. Her face still twisted into that awful smile. The thing above her... I did not recognize. Human in shape, but not in detail. Its skin was pale, impossibly smooth, almost translucent and... dripping... He can’t wear human skin...\n\n \n\nIt laid atop her, and it was feeding. Its mouth pressed against her empty eye socket and... slurped. I could hear it. The sucking, wet cascade as it drank.\n\n \n\nI thought about shooting it but... I knew deep down that it wouldn’t do a damn thing. What could I do? The moments in which we weren’t noticed were fleeting. I had to think fast.\n\n \n\n“You have her eye...” Brad whispered. I turned to see him staring at me, jaw agape. “She’s still with us...”\n\n \n\nI nodded in response.\n\n \n\nBrad turned his head back towards the altar, and then back to me again. I could see gears turning. His eyes and mine locked, and I saw within them his intentions. I saw sorrow, I saw regret, and I saw a new found conviction. A hope where there hadn’t been any before. He believed that I could get her back. In his belief, I found my own.\n\n \n\nHis eyes issued me one final direction.\n\n \n\n“Tell her I loved her...”\n\n \n\nBefore I could contemplate stopping him, he had broken from Gray’s grip and sprinted across the room towards the unholy thing. Screaming something both primal and anguished.\n\n \n\nThe thing turned its head and I saw what primitive manner of a face that it had. Just a trio of sagging, cavernous, black holes for eyes and a mouth. A permanent state of melting gloom. Brad pulled the beast off of his daughter, shouting all manner of incomprehensible garble as he entangled with it.\n\n \n\nGray ran after Brad and the man of wax, and I ran for Harmony. I pulled her off the stone slab and dragged her limp body to a corner, away from the chaos. Beyond that, I wasn’t sure what I would do.\n\n \n\nShe smiled at me, that same evil smile, though her body appeared completely physically drained from being fed upon.\n\n \n\n“Harmony!” I yelled, trying somehow to break past whatever had overtaken her.\n\n \n\nShe let out a weak giggle, “Candle Caine, Candle Caine, Candle Caine.” Repeated in a playful sing-song.\n\n \n\nI wasn’t sure if the inspiration came from myself, or from someone else in my head... but I knew in that moment what I had to do.\n\n \n\n“It’s weak, Harmony. It’s drained. Take it back...” I said aloud, hoping the real Harmony could hear me, before producing one more hairpin from my pocket.\n\n \n\nI heard Gray shout in agony. I quickly glanced over. He was on the ground, writhing in pain. I saw lots of red, but I couldn’t make out the extent of the damage. The thing had Brad’s skull tight in the grasp of both of its lanky primordial hands, and he was screaming. But his screams were silenced, when the thing’s mouth clasped around his left eye. I heard squelching and popping and slurping. Like what it had been doing to Harmony, but so much more violent. It was nauseating... But not as nauseating as what I had to do next.\n\n \n\nI turned back to the twisted Harmony, and said it once more. “Take it all back.”\n\n \n\nI pulled my left eyelid down, and plunged the hairpin underneath it, sinking it into the pink meat under my eye. The adrenaline didn’t hide the pain. The feeling of metal inside flesh never gets any less uncomfortable. I pushed the pin further inside and began to press down, using my ocular cavity like a fulcrum. My eye began to awkwardly bulge out and my vision got fuzzy.\n\n \n\nI felt each end of the pin wrap around the string on the back of my eye. The tingling sensation of the touching and tearing of exposed nerves sent shockwaves through my body. I had to finish this fast.\n\n \n\nWith one quick push down and pull back, my eye dislodged from its home completely and dangled free against my cheek. Without any further hesitation, I snapped the cord with my fingernail and severed the link. I held the slimy, squishy, baby blue eye in my hand. Then I pried open the lids of Harmony’s empty socket, and slipped it inside cord-first.\n\n \n\nIt was a struggle to get it to hold in place, but I could feel her skull begin shifting. It was like her body was coercing it back into place. One I got the lids folded over, something began to change. She began to shake and convulse violently. Her mouth began foaming. I worried that I had just killed her. Had I just sent the last vestige of her soul to die?\n\n \n\nI looked to the beast once more, just in time to hear a sickening crunch as Brad’s skull was compressed to pieces between its hands. All while the wax thing continued to drink. Like squeezing the last bit of juice from a juice box.\n\n \n\nWhen he had gotten it all, he tossed his husk of a body aside like a rag doll. Then he came for Gray. I had to distract him. I rose to my feet.\n\n \n\n“Caine!” I yelled. It got its attention.\n\n \n\n“That’s who you are, isn’t it?” I continued. “You’re Mr. Caine. It’s your bones underneath that wax. Whitley dug you up, didn’t he?”\n\n \n\nThe beast slowly stalked towards me, as I backed off at the same pace. Gray got to his feet and silently moved somewhere I couldn’t see.\n\n \n\n“You were always the ritual, weren’t you? You wanted to bring someone back from the dead. Bring their consciousness back from the other side, so they could show you and guide you to the promised land. Well now you’ve been there and back. What can you show me?”\n\n \n\nThe thing didn’t falter. It continued to stalk at the same pace. I was quickly running out of room, but I had also talked myself into a revelation.\n\n \n\n“You led yourself to this didn’t you? You wanted to find The Father... But you were The Father. You spoke to Whitley from the other side, but you also spoke to yourself from the other side. A place beyond time and space. You worshipped yourself. This was always the endgame... Well, was it everything you wanted?”\n\n \n\nThe thing jutted its arms out and gripped either side of my head, just like it did Brad’s. Its fingers were crude, jagged, and spindly. Somehow both solid and liquid at the same time. I stared into its black holes of eyes... and I could see the abyss staring back at me. The glimmer of something alive deep within. Deeper than physically possible. Then it raised its mouth to me, past my vision’s edge, to feed from my empty socket.\n\n \n\nI felt the suction begin, and it was like a vacuum. Something like a long, hot, wet tongue tickled at the inside of my skull and wormed towards my brain. Those awful tingling shockwaves began again. My entire body felt like pins and needles, even more so than when it was actually full of pins and needles.\n\n \n\nSomething severed the connection. The sucking stopped, the tongue rescinded, and the grip on my head loosened. I dropped to my knees, and looked up to see what had happened.\n\n \n\nHarmony was wrestling with the beast. She had the chalice in her hand, trying to force it to drink something. I saw that her hand was bleeding.\n\n \n\nGray jumped into action and tried holding the thing down. I wondered where he had gone. In a final, frustrated gasp, Harmony plunged the entire chalice into its gaping maw. Then the beast went still.\n\n \n\nSomehow I knew what she had done. Maybe I had just attuned myself to the insanity, but I knew. She poisoned the well. It used her blood when she was corrupted to strengthen the bond to the other side, but now she was whole again. Purged of the infection. Her soul intact, and her soul was dangerous. They spent all that time making her special, and in the end she was too special.\n\n \n\nHarmony collapsed. She had either passed out or was very close to it. I tried to pull her away towards the stairs as best as I could. Gray helped us both, though the claw marks in his chest looked horribly deep.\n\n \n\nThe creature began to stir... but more than that, it began to bubble. Its waxy flesh lost its stability and form. A torrent of blood began to rush out of its mouth and trickle form its eyes. A complete bodily rejection. But it didn’t scream. It couldn’t. It could only gurgle.\n\n \n\nI saw its waxy form begin to flake and the texture slowly changed. Squiggles of veins began popping up. It started to wrinkle and become dotted with pores. It was growing human skin... Her blood was making it human... It can’t wear skin.\n\n \n\nI shuffled myself and Harmony’s half-conscious body towards the exit, but Gray instead confidently stepped towards it. He brandished a bottle of olive oil. He had gone upstairs to get it.\n\n \n\nHe tossed it at the bubbling, bleeding monstrosity with enough force that it managed to shatter against the softened and pulsating waxy skin. The oil spilled, covering the ground.\n\n \n\nI grabbed one of the lit candles and we began to move up the stairs as the thing continued to writhe and transform.\n\n \n\nI gave the candle a soft toss into the oil, and the flames lit instantly. We hurried our way up the stairs and through the basement as fast as we could, but then I stopped.\n\n \n\n“Get her out, I’ll be right behind you.” I called out to Gray.\n\n \n\n“What? Fuck that, let’s go!” He protested.\n\n \n\n“Go! I’ll be right there! I just have to get something! Go, now!”\n\n \n\nGray shook his head and continued helping Harmony towards the second set of stairs. I moved to Brad’s computer. I didn’t have the strength left to lug the whole thing. I just had to get the hard drive out before all the evidence went up in flames. Maybe the only chance Harmony would have.\n\n \n\nI forced open the case and dug out the SSD, but then I saw the fire creeping in through the hidden door. With it, I saw Caine. The body still barely clinging to its human form in a painstaking effort. The skin burned away, and the wax melted off him in droves. I began to see the vestiges of muscle and tissue forming and burning at an equal rate within.\n\n \n\n“I...” Caine attempted to speak through his gurgling. “I can... make you...”\n\n \n\nI tried to turn away and run, but suddenly I couldn’t. I still saw those hellish eyes, deep in the recesses of his black, cavernous sockets, and they had a hold of me. There was something within them. Something beyond reality, and he was showing it to me. One last ditch effort but I couldn’t resist it.\n\n \n\nThe walls fell away. Everything fell away. Even him, and even me. All I saw was an ocean. It stretched further and wider than the earth. And it was empty. Nothing but the crashing of the waves. It was vast, but then in an instant it was tiny. It was nothing. It was a glass of water. Filled to the top.\n\n \n\nI tipped it just a little bit and it spilled out on a concrete floor. I looked again just a little bit later and the spill had evaporated into a damp spot. I looked a third time and it had grown into a sickening mold. Within the mold were thousands of screaming faces.\n\n \n\nThe mold grew into a mossy bog. The bog grew into a dense forest. The trees muffled the screams, and suddenly it was empty again. It flooded and became an ocean once more. No sound, no life. I was alone, but I didn’t even exist anymore.\n\n \n\nHe didn’t speak to me, but his words wormed their way into me. Not in sound, but in feeling. “I can make you no one. Isn’t that what you wanted? You’re not happy. You’ll never be free. You don’t belong anywhere. So be nowhere. Be nothing. Be stardust on the other side. No one will see you. You won’t see you.”\n\n \n\nWas he right? Was this what I wanted? Sometimes I thought it was... He was right that I wasn’t happy. But Harmony was right too. She was right about everything. I wasn’t happy... but that doesn’t mean I can’t be. I just need to unpack my boxes. I just need help. I just need someone.\n\n \n\nI conveyed my message. I laid bare my feelings. “No. I don’t want to be no one. I just want to be me.”\n\n \n\nI concentrated hard. Trying to will myself out of this final nightmare. I focused all of my energy on those feelings and they became a life raft in that vast ocean. I began to see myself again. The real me. And I was so relieved to see her. That is who I am. I belong. I deserve to be me.\n\n \n\nGray’s words echoed through the infinite sky. “One way.” This was it. The one way was to live. Live and not just survive.\n\n \n\nThe waves crashed and didn’t want to let me go, but sometimes amidst all of the deep thoughts, it’s the simplest ones that keep you going. I had one more thought, and it was the easiest and most basic of them all: Harmony’s alive. I would really like to meet her.\n\n \n\nThat was the last push. That was all it took. I was back in the basement, at the moment I left. Staring down the burning flesh. He was weak. He had no more tricks. He was dying. I turned my back to him and walked up the stairs.\n\n \n\nIn one final act, to ensure that Fraser Caine would truly be no more, I turned on the gas stoves in the kitchen and sprinted out the door.\n\n \n\nGray was there waiting. Harmony sat unconscious in the back seat of his car, Gray’s jacket draped over her shoulders. I briefly flashed him the SSD before making my way to the passenger side.\n\n \n\n“How is she?” I asked.\n\n \n\n“Seems alright, just tired... You’re fuckin’ insane, you know that?” He spoke through a pained grimace.\n\n \n\n“Yeah. Let’s get the hell out of here, this whole place is gonna go in a few seconds.”\n\n \n\n“Shit.” Gray muttered, quickly climbing into the car as I did the same.\n\n \n\nWe drove off and I could just barely see the glow of an enormous fireball in the rear-view mirror. With it came the biggest and most cathartic sigh of my life. I could breathe for the first time in a long time. Despite all the pain and the deep discomfort, my headache was finally gone.\n\n \n\nGray parked on the side of the road a few streets away, letting out a long breath of his own.\n\n \n\n“It’s fucked up that I’m not gonna be able to tell anyone about this.” Gray remarked.\n\n \n\n“Oh I don’t know... I think Benji would love it.”\n\n \n\nGray chuckled. “Yeah you’re right... Kinda don’t wanna give him the satisfaction.”\n\n \n\n“Understandable.” I said, knowing full well that I would tell him and probably buy more weed.\n\n \n\n“Guess I should get us all to a hospital now...” Gray said.\n\n \n\nI scoffed. “I hate hospitals... Plus, as soon as we get in there it’s gonna be chaos. Questioning, lawyers, all three of us will most likely be arrested. It’s gonna be a nightmare trying to set all this right... Can we just... take a minute?”\n\n \n\nGray nodded in agreement. “Okay. Let’s take a minute. What do you wanna do with your minute, Cole?”\n\n \n\nI thought about it for a couple seconds. “What time does that pizza place close?”\n\n \n\n“Hah. I knew it. Couldn’t get enough, could ya?” Gray smiled, and began driving.\n\n \n\nWe arrived about ten minutes later. Gray went in to grab our slices, and I sat on the hood of the car, facing the night sky and enjoying the calm breeze.\n\n \n\nGray returned with three slices. “Y’know, in case she wakes up.” He explained. “If not, I can eat both.”\n\n \n\n“How considerate of you, Gray.”\n\n \n\n“Yeah... You know what, fuck it. Call me Wally.”\n\n \n\n “Oh?” I raised my eyebrows and smirked. “I get your fancy nickname?”\n\n \n\n“Yeah... I just don’t imagine I’ll be getting rid of you anytime soon so, might as well.”\n\n \n\n“I’m honored.”\n\n \n\n“You should be. So... Detective Cole... When all this is in the rear-view... What are you gonna do?”\n\n \n\nI smiled, simply at the notion of this all being over. It was hard to believe. Before I could think of an answer, I heard the car door open and shut behind us.\n\n \n\nHarmony lethargically made her way towards us, holding her head like she was hungover. Gray wordlessly handed her the slice of pizza, which she accepted without question.\n\n \n\n“I love this place.” She commented.\n\n \n\n“No shit. You’ve been?” Gray asked.\n\n \n\n“Been a few years but yeah... Actually, didn’t you work here?”\n\n \n\n“Hah. Wally, nice to meet you.” Of course she gets Wally immediately. Gray turned to me. “See? I told you, everybody knows everybody.”\n\n \n\nHarmony smiled. The first time I had seen her true smile in person, even if it was weighed down by lifetimes worth of trauma. Gray stood up and offered her his spot on the hood, which she accepted.\n\n \n\n“Just gonna shout at Benji for a sec, I’ll be back.” Gray said, before walking into the building, leaving Harmony and I alone.\n\n \n\nIt was hard to think of what to say to her. So much rushed through my mind. Should I bring up her mother, should I bring up her father? Should I bring up anything at all?\n\n \n\n“Guess I should say nice to meet you too.” I finally spoke.\n\n \n\nShe smiled again. For that moment it felt like all was right in the world.\n\n \n\n“Yeah that’s true... Nice to meet you, officially.”\n\n \n\nWe sat in that rare nice moment for a while, but it was burning me up to not say anything more...\n\n \n\n“I’m sorry... I’m sorry I didn’t get to you sooner. I’m sorry I couldn’t save them.”\n\n \n\nShe shook her head, I could tell she was stifling her emotions to the best of her ability.\n\n \n\n“No... No... You did so much. I can’t even begin... I’m the one who should...” She stammered as her voice cracked. “It’s just all so fucking....”\n\n \n\nThe tears slowly began to flow and they were almost instantly contagious, but I tried my best to hold strong. I could see her trying and failing to do the same.\n\n \n\nAfter a moment she had to give up trying. The dam burst and her silent tears turned to exasperated and pained sobs. I clenched my jaw and placed a hand on her back. In response, she sank into me and wrapped her arms around me tightly. She clung to me for dear life while her tears soaked through my shirt.\n\n \n\nI couldn’t hold back the tears anymore. Everything washed over me in an instant. A brutal mixture of grief, despair, pain, and relief. My arms instinctively reached out and clung to her in return. This may have been the first time I had cried in front of another human being in my entire adult life, yet I didn’t mind it so much. It was a strange feeling, to find such comfort in the arms of someone I had never met, yet someone I felt as though I had known intimately. No one else would ever know what we went through. Gray, to an extent, but I wouldn’t be caught dead crying in his shoulder.\n\n \n\nA thought occurred to me and I began to laugh as I felt the tears stream down my face.\n\n \n\n“How the fuck am I crying without an eye?”\n\n \n\nHarmony’s cries turned to a snort of laughter. “I know, right? I was surprised too.”\n\n \n\n“God it feels weird.”\n\n \n\n“It does. It really does. I’m sorry.”\n\n \n\nWe finally pulled apart, still letting out spurts of exhausted laughter.\n\n \n\n“Oh god.” She said, wiping my shirt. “I got tears and snot all over your shirt.”\n\n \n\n“It’s fine, it’s not so bad. Gray... Wally... he got my favorite Bullet Club shirt cut off a few days ago, I haven’t forgiven him.”\n\n \n\n“Bullet Club?”\n\n \n\n“It’s not... like that. It’s a thing.” I stammered.\n\n \n\n“Okay but still, you’re a cop, it kinda sends a message.”\n\n \n\n“Well I don’t wear it to work! It’s not... It’s just... It’s a cool shirt, from a thing I like.”\n\n \n\n“Alright, fair enough. Hey, I’m not judging... Sucks that you lost it.”\n\n \n\n“Nah it’s fine. To be honest, it didn’t actually fit me that well anyway.”\n\n \n\nHarmony just smiled at me and briefly laid her head on my shoulder. A few very peaceful moments of silence passed, and then Gray exited the store and walked towards us.\n\n \n\n“I mainly just wanted to go in there so I could bleed all over his floor and make him mop it up. How are you ladies doin’?”\n\n \n\n“All things considered, could be worse.” I answered. “Should probably hit the road before you bleed to death, old man.”\n\n \n\n“Yeah I’m beginning to get a little light headed, if we crash I apologize... By the way, you never answered my question, Cole.”\n\n \n\n“What question was that?”\n\n \n\n“When this is all over, providing we don’t go to jail for arson and whatnot, what are you gonna do?”\n\n \n\nI took a second to think about it. Harmony looked at me, eager to hear my response, and it was in her eyes that I found it.\n\n \n\n“I think I’m gonna go dancing.”"},"93":{"title":"I Saw Myselfs on the CCTV, and the Mall Became a Maze of Mes [Part 2]","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k89afp\/i_saw_myselfs_on_the_cctv_and_the_mall_became_a\/","flair":"Series","author":"YogurtclosetTrick649","selftext":"[Part 1](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k6s9n7\/i_saw_myselfs_on_the_cctv_and_the_mall_became_a\/)\n\nThe moment I stepped into the corridor, reality buckled like a heat-wrapped film.\n\nI ran, my flashlight beam fracturing into prisms, painting the corridors with colors that didn’t exist. The mall wasn’t the mall anymore. The hallways twisted like intestines, walls glistening with a sheen that pulsed like breathing flesh. Clocks hung from the ceiling, their faces liquefied, hands spinning backward, then forward, spiraling into impossible knots. My footsteps echoed, but they weren’t mine alone.\n\nOthers joined—too many, out of rhythm, some skittering like insects, others heavy as stone. I passed a storefront, its glass now a mirror, and saw not one reflection, but hundreds, crowding the surface. Their faces melted, mouths screamed silently, eyes blooming like flowers of black light.\n\nThe air tasted of ash and static, and the lights flickered in patterns that carved shapes into my vision—spirals, fractals, things that shouldn’t be seen. I stumbled into the food court, now a cavern of impossible geometry. Tables floated in mid-air, their legs twisting and curling like roots; chairs sprouted thorns of glass that shimmered in the dim light.\n\nIn the center stood another me, his uniform shredded, skin translucent, veins glowing like constellations. His head lolled unnaturally, neck bending at angles that made my stomach churn. He turned toward me, and his eyes were not voids but endless depths, swirling with stars that pulsed in time with my heartbeat. I froze, horrified and mesmerized, as it stared back at me—*through* me, as though it knew something I didn’t.\n\n*“You’re late,”* he said, his voice a chorus of mine, layered with tones that made my skull throb. His mouth split wider, teeth spiraling inward like the jaws of a black hole, pulling at the very air around us. *“They’re here. The ones who are you. The ones who aren’t. Time’s a tapestry—and you’re the tear.”*\n\nI screamed, my voice unraveling into threads of light that floated upward. I ran, the mall folding in on itself, corridors looping into Mobius strips, doors opening to ceilings, to voids, to versions of the food court where the other mes waited. One grabbed me, his hand cold as deep space, fingers sinking into my arm like roots. ‘Don’t look at the stars,’ he whispered, his face collapsing into a swirl of colors that burned my retinas like poison. I struggled, my arm locked in his grip, skin sizzling as the roots burrowed deeper. And then—*a flash*—I tore free, my skin peeling away in ribbons of light.\n\nSomehow, I reached the parking lot. The sky was a wound, stars pulsing like infected sores, constellations whispering my name in languages older than bone. My car sat where I left it, but its reflection in the asphalt split into a dozen shadows—each with a different me inside. One clawed at the glass. Another grinned, teeth too many. One just wept, eyes static-blurred. I got in. The engine groaned like it knew the road was wrong. I drove, the road stretching into infinity, the horizon folding upward like a wave.\n\nI’m home now, but home isn’t right. The walls shimmer, the mirrors show faces that aren’t mine but are. I checked my apartment’s security camera feed. There I am, standing in the hallway, my body a silhouette of writhing shapes, my eyes leaking light. Behind me, the shadow is taller, its edges blooming into fractals that swallow the frame. I’m inside, typing this, but I hear footsteps in the hall, too many, all mine.\n\nI don’t know what I am anymore. But I know I’m not alone."},"94":{"title":"I’ve been stuck in an endless highway tunnel for 7 days (part 3)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k76avn\/ive_been_stuck_in_an_endless_highway_tunnel_for_7\/","flair":"Series","author":"sn0ttyr0cket","selftext":"[Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k0zuhn\/ive_been_stuck_driving_in_an_endless_highway\/)\n\n**DAY 4**\n\nPhone died. I think batteries drain faster in here. I don’t know what time it is. No way to tell. \n\nI didn’t come across any more service spots after the last post I made anyway. \n\nI am writing in my journal to keep me sane. \n\nI am writing in my journal to keep me sane. \n\nI am not dead yet\n\nI am not dead yet\n\nI am not dead yet\n\nI saw the creatures. Last night after I walked for hours, maybe even days. They were suddenly illuminated by my flashlight in the dark, lining the sides of the tunnel, just watching me. At least I think — they didn’t have eyes. Probably evolved to be rid of them after centuries in the tunnel, maybe? \n\nThey hummed my tune again, softly, almost indistinguishable from the whistling of the wind. \n\nThey were humanlike, but dark grey, veiny, skinny, tall. Limbs slightly too long. Again, no eyes, and just small holes for a nose and ears. \n\nWhere was the mouth? \n\nThe Mouth\n\nThe Mouth\n\nThe Mouth\n\nI walked past them all, backs pressed flat against the tunnel walls with their arms pinned to their sides.\n\nI passed hundreds of them, noticing more and more features. Huge flat feet planted firmly to the ground. Long, sharp fingernails on fingers with at least 5 knuckles. \n\nOne on its own, standing in the middle of the tunnel, blocking my path. Its back to me. \n\nI stopped. Should I speak? \n\nI stood there watching it for some time, debating what I should do. \n\nI turned around. All of those things were now facing towards me: leaning, peering around each other. Their humming grew louder.\n\nI looked back to the one standing in front of me. It, too, faced me now. I gasped, overtaken by its putrid gasoline smell and its slimy, featureless face. \n\nThen, its face started… splitting. Its skin was pulling, ripping apart. Dark blood oozed as its flesh tore.\n\nThe Mouth\n\nThe Mouth\n\nThe Mouth\n\nIt opened wide and I looked inside. Look inside. Look inside.

Never-ending darkness, the same tunnel walls, the same puddles and pebbles, the same strange noises echoing through this hollow tomb. \n\nGET ME OUT GET ME OUT\n\nI’m afraid I’ve seen too much. That they won’t let me leave now that I know things. \n\nI know what they are, what I am, what we are. Collective consciousness. Nothing matters, everything is meaningless, or is everything full of meaning?\n\nI’m not making any sense. \n\nI need to conserve my light. \n\n\n\n**DAY 6**\n\nI understand now. I cannot leave. This is where I am meant to be; I ended up here for a reason. \n\nThey never wanted to hurt me. They wanted to show me. \n\nI am more than this body, this life. I am more than a lost drifter, constantly searching for meaning, for a place I belong. \n\nI was right; we are all connected. Except we aren’t living parallel lives — we are all living the same life in different universes.\n\nIn one universe, we are me, and in another, we are you. We are everyone, all at once. \n\nWhen I looked inside \n\nThe Mouth \n\nThe Mouth \n\nThe Mouth \n\nI saw everything. I saw every human experience.

You just need to look inside. \n\nLook inside. \n\n\n\n**DAY 7**\n\nI walk with them now. \n\nWe hum together. \n\n\n~~~ \nMy daughter’s body was found by a hunter and his two young sons. She was somewhere in a Nebraskan wildlife management area. Poor kids were traumatized. \n\nMy daughter was… troubled. She dealt with paranoid delusions and manic depressive episodes throughout her life. She would often disappear for weeks at a time. \n\nI worried, of course, as any mother would. But I had called the cops to report her missing so many times, just for her to show back up at home a couple weeks later. The cops stopped taking me seriously after the 15th time, and I don’t blame them.\n\nJune, my daughter, was lost. A lonely, sick young woman who wandered the planet like a ghost. \n\nPlease don’t go looking for this “tunnel” she was clearly so obsessed with in her final days. There was no goddamn tunnel anywhere near her body. She was found dead in the woods, leaning against a tree. We still have yet to locate her car.\n\nShe had gouged out her eyes with her bare hands. She had broken her own jaw, so her mouth hung open wide. Beside her, her journal, with the entries I uploaded here. I figured you all might appreciate the closure these would provide. I didn't want any of you thinking she was still out there, and, God forbid, go looking for her, just to get as lost as she was.\n\nIt was only a matter of time. \n\nI’m just glad that June finally felt connected to something when she passed. \n\nI feel connected, too.

I work as a nurse at West View Hospital and my shifts were always draining, especially that day since I had to work a double.\n\nFinally, my shift ended and I hurried out the door.  I appreciated not having to worry about parking in a city that was normally so busy, living so close to work had its advantages. West View was often still bustling at that hour, but tonight it felt eerily abandoned, as though the world had retreated into the shadows. My apartment building loomed ahead and I quickened my pace, anxious to get inside.\n\nI stepped into the lobby of Central Heights, passing by Ray the doorman and offering a polite nod to his wave. Normally, I would have stopped to chat, but I was too tired and was just looking forward to a bath, a stiff drink, and maybe a TV show before I collapsed into sleep.\n\nAs I made my way toward the elevator, I was already scrolling through my phone for something to watch while waiting for the long ride to the 16th floor. I pressed the button, and suddenly felt a strange sensation. The hair on my arms stood on end and I felt like I was being watched. I glanced over my shoulder but saw nothing, no one was in the lobby; Ray was still at his station, absorbed in a novel. It must have been nothing, I tried to reassure myself. Yet, the feeling persisted, like unseen fingers trailing along my spine.\n\nWhen the elevator finally arrived, I stepped in without hesitation. I quickly pressed 16 and waited. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed something odd: a powdery white dust near the elevator console. I checked myself to make sure I hadn’t gotten any on me, but there was no trace of it on my clothes or skin.\n\nThen I looked closer and saw a chalk-like smudge right on the console between the numbers 12 and 14. A disturbing chill ran through me as my hand hovered near the strange mark. I paused, processing the bizarre sight before the bell chimed and the doors opened to my floor. Shrugging off the unease, I stepped off.\n\nI walked down the hall to my apartment and sighed with relief that my day was over. As I approached my door, eager to collapse onto my couch, I rummaged through my bag. A knot formed in my stomach as I realized  my keys were still at the hospital, left on the break room counter. I groaned and trudged back to the elevator, resigned to having to retrieve them.\n\nI pressed the down button, and after a brief wait, the door opened, not far from where I stood. To my surprise, I wasn’t alone in the elevator. There, occupying the small space, was an impossibly large figure draped in a long white coat. Their face was hidden by a hood, and their tall, rail-thin form exuded an unsettling presence. I took an instinctive step back, disturbed by the sight, but I tried to steady myself and not stare. I considered waiting for the next elevator, yet the door wouldn’t close. The figure remained motionless, its hood concealing any trace of expression as it stared impassively.\n\nRealizing I had no way to get back to my apartment without my keys, I reluctantly stepped into the elevator with the tall figure and pressed the button for the lobby. That’s when something made me do a double take, even with the giant hooded figure standing silently beside me, I noticed an extra button on the panel: a softly glowing 13.\n\nIt wasn’t there earlier when I’d gone up to my own floor. I noticed the 13 button bore a large imprint of white chalky powder, and I saw that the looming figure’s feet were also surrounded by that same odd substance.\n\nThe elevator lurched into motion as I felt a cold dread wash over me. The buttons on the panel flickered in a strange, otherworldly rhythm as the elevator began its descent. The hooded figure beside me remained completely still, filling the confined space with an oppressive silence. I felt its unseen gaze upon me, its face forever obscured by the hood. My breath caught when the elevator slowed and the digital display above the doors flickered from 14 to a distorted blur, then to a number that sent a chill coursing through my veins…13.\n\nWhen the doors slid open with a hollow clang, a dimly lit hallway unfolded before me, a place that didn’t belong in my building. Thick, damp air spilled out, carrying the scent of old dust mixed with a trace of something metallic. My heart pounded as the figure stepped forward with an unnervingly fluid grace. Pausing in the doorway, it slowly turned its hooded head in my direction, as though silently inviting me to follow.\n\nI stood rooted to the spot, unable to move. My legs refused to budge as my mind screamed for me to run, to shout, to do anything other than step further into that dark, unnatural space. Suddenly, I felt lightheaded and tried to steady myself against the elevator wall, but before I knew it, I crumbled to the floor, unconscious.\n\nWhen I came to, I sat up abruptly and nearly screamed, only to realize that I was still in the elevator. It had descended back to the lobby, and the strange hooded figure was nowhere to be seen. I had no idea how I had passed out; perhaps I was more exhausted than I’d thought. Yet it had felt so real, too real.\n\nI’d never experienced such a vivid nightmare before. As I stepped out, I glanced back at the elevator panel one last time and noticed a faint smudge of white powder near it. Shaken, I left and headed back to work to retrieve my keys.\n\nWhen I got back to my building, Ray commented on how stressed I looked. I told him it was nothing more than bad nerves after a long day. He nodded, and I pressed on. Yet when I arrived at the elevator again, that inexplicable, unsettling feeling returned. Despite how late it was and how tired I felt, I decided to take the stairs. I was sweating and utterly exhausted after the climb, but eventually I reached my apartment. I chose to forgo the bath in favor of a quick shower and then went straight to bed.\n\nThe next morning, on my way to work, I was disturbed to see paramedics gathered outside the building. Approaching Ray, I asked him what had happened.  His face was drawn, his usual smile absent. Leaning in closer and lowering his voice, he said,\n\n\"It's Mrs. Donovan from 1406. They found her this morning when she didn’t answer her door. Her daughter called, worried when she couldn’t reach her.\"\n\nA chill ran through me. \"What happened to her?\"\n\n\"Nobody knows for sure,\" Ray replied, glancing toward the paramedics. \"The police say it looks strange. There are no obvious signs of what killed her, but…\" He hesitated, shifting uncomfortably. \"They mentioned she was covered in some kind of white powder. Like chalk or something. I’ve never seen anything like it in my thirty years here.\"\n\nThe world seemed to tilt beneath me. White powder. Just like in the elevator. Just like in my nightmare.\n\n\"Did you know her?\" Ray asked, noticing the pallor in my face.\n\n\"Not really,\" I managed to say, my mouth suddenly dry. \"I only passed her in the halls sometimes.\" I tried to recall her face, but all I could conjure was a vague image of an elderly woman with silver hair who always nodded politely when we crossed paths.\n\n\"They’re saying it might have been sudden cardiac arrest, but who knows,\" Ray continued. \"Poor woman, living alone all these years after her husband passed. At least it was quick, whatever it was.\"\n\nI nodded mechanically, my eyes fixed on the elevator doors. I thanked Ray for the information and mentioned that I had to get to work. Yet deep down, I felt disturbed. I had wanted to dismiss the unsettling news about the tenant found dead, but with that bizarre substance mentioned, it was eerily similar to what I’d seen with that tall hooded figure. The thoughts clung to me, refusing to let me find any peace.\n\nThe rest of my work day passed in a hazy blur, and I felt detached from everything as I struggled to process the bizarre events of the previous night. I hurried home with anxious dread gnawing at the back of my mind.\n\nArriving back at my apartment building, I mustered the courage to approach the elevator again. The metallic doors slid open with a soft ding, and though I hesitated for just a moment, I stepped inside.\n\nMy eyes darted around the small, dimly lit space, half-expecting shadows to flicker in the corners. Taking a steadying breath, I pressed the button for my floor while carefully scanning the panel for anything unusual. This time, the area between the numbers 12 and 14 was clean and unmarked, devoid of any peculiar chalky residue. The elevator hummed quietly as it ascended, leaving only the sterile scent of metal and the gentle whir of machinery.\n\nI exhaled a sigh of relief at the return to normalcy and walked down the hall to my apartment. Just as I inserted my key into the lock, I heard footsteps approaching down the hall.\n\n\"Oh hey, I thought that was you.\"\n\nI turned to see Chelsea Matthews, my neighbor from 1604, walking toward me with a reusable grocery bag slung over one arm. Her dark curls were pulled back into a messy bun, and though her face attempted a smile, worry was etched in every line.\n\n\"Hi Chelsea,\" I greeted her with a forced smile.\n\nChelsea glanced over her shoulder before stepping closer. \"Did you hear about Mrs. Donovan?\" she whispered, her voice tight.\n\nI nodded, still holding my key in the door. \"Ray told me this morning. It’s awful.\"\n\n\"I can’t stop thinking about it,\" Chelsea admitted, clutching her grocery bag closer to her chest. \"I saw her just two days ago in the laundry room. She seemed perfectly fine, even talking about her granddaughter’s ballet recital.\"\n\nA chill crept up my spine. \"Did Ray mention the white powder they found?\"\n\nHer eyes widened. \"Yes! That’s what’s so strange. My sister works at the police station as a clerk, and she couldn’t tell me much, but she said the investigators were baffled. It wasn’t any kind of drug or poison they recognized, just this weird chalky substance all over her apartment.\" Her voice dropped even lower. \"The medical examiner still hasn’t determined a cause of death.\"\n\nMy legs felt weak as I leaned against the door frame. \"That’s…disturbing.\"\n\n\"There's something else,\" Chelsea confided, stepping even closer. \"Mrs. Donovan mentioned something weird the last time I saw her. She talked about having nightmares of a tall figure in white visiting her at night.\" She shook her head. \"I assumed it was just an old woman’s imagination, you know? But now…\"\n\nThe key slipped from my fingers, clattering against the hardwood floor, making Chelsea jump.\n\n\"Sorry,\" I mumbled as I bent to retrieve it with trembling hands. \"Did she say anything else about this figure?\"\n\nChelsea furrowed her brow. \"Just that it was impossibly tall and wore some kind of hood. She mentioned it even left marks on her floor, like footprints or something.\" She shrugged helplessly. \"I figured it was just her medication giving her vivid dreams.\"\n\nMy mouth went dry. \"And you said this was…two days ago?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" she nodded. \"The day before she died.\" Studying my face, she asked, \"Are you okay? You look a bit pale.\"\n\n\"I'm fine,\" I lied, forcing myself to stand a little taller. \"Just tired from work. These double shifts are killing me.\" I fumbled with my key once more. \"I should get some rest.\"\n\n\"Alright then, take care and stay safe. I’ll see you around, and don’t work yourself too hard. Have a good rest of the night,\" Chelsea said, waving as she headed back to her own apartment.\n\nI stepped inside my apartment and released the breath I hadn’t realized I was holding, my mind still echoing with all the disturbing things Chelsea had said about Mrs. Donovan and her untimely death.\n\nPushing myself away from the door, I moved through my darkened apartment, flipping on lights as I went. The shadows seemed longer tonight, and the corners of my home appeared darker and more ominous. In the kitchen, I poured myself a glass of wine with shaking hands, spilling a few drops on the counter, though I didn’t bother to wipe them up.\n\nThe television droned on in the background as I curled up on my couch, wrapping myself in a throw blanket despite the warmth of the apartment. News footage of paramedics outside my building played silently, a reporter discussing the “mysterious death” of an elderly resident. I quickly changed the channel.\n\nSleep proved impossible. Every time I closed my eyes, that hooded figure and the impossible thirteenth floor replayed in my mind. Chelsea’s words about Mrs. Donovan’s nightmares echoed incessantly, the same nightmares I’d had. The same figure I’d seen.\n\nAround midnight, I finally dragged myself to bed. I lay awake, staring at the ceiling and listening to the occasional creaks and groans of the building settling. My eyelids grew heavy despite my anxiety, and eventually I drifted into an uneasy sleep.\n\nI woke with a start, my alarm blaring beside me. For a moment, I felt disoriented, unable to tell if I had truly slept or merely closed my eyes for a few minutes. My body felt heavy and my mind foggy as I dragged myself out of bed and into the shower.\n\nThe hot water did little to wash away my unease. As I dressed for work, I found myself continuously glancing toward my door, half-expecting a knock or the turn of the handle. I chided myself for being irrational but couldn’t shake the dread that had firmly taken root in my mind.\n\nMy morning routine took longer than usual. Every sound startled me. By the time I was ready to leave, I was already running late.\n\nI hesitated at my door, took a deep breath, and stepped into the hallway. The corridor was quiet, with morning light filtering through the windows at each end. I locked my door and headed toward the elevator, only to freeze mid-step.\n\nThere, in the middle of the hallway, stood Chelsea. I recalled that she worked at a different hospital across town, yet she was in her hospital scrubs, though they looked rumpled as if she’d slept in them. Her hair hung loose and tangled around her shoulders.\n\n\"Chelsea?\" I called out cautiously. \"Are you okay?\"\n\nShe didn’t respond at first, remaining perfectly still with her gaze fixed on the wall. Something about her unresponsive stillness sent a chill down my spine.\n\n\"Chelsea?\" I tried again, gently reaching out to touch her shoulder.\n\nAt my touch, her head snapped toward me, but her eyes remained unfocused, gazing through me rather than at me. Her pupils were dilated and her face looked unnaturally pale.\n\n\"It comes at night,\" Chelsea whispered, her voice raspy and strange. \"The shadow of death. It wears white, but leaves darkness. It marks them first. The thirteenth floor…it's waiting there.\"\n\nMy blood ran cold. \"Chelsea, what are you talking about? There is no thirteenth floor.\"\n\n\"I saw it last night,\" she continued, her voice slurring slightly. \"In the elevator. The button appeared. White dust. So cold.\" She shuddered violently. \"It knows who's next.\"\n\nI gripped her shoulders, shaking her gently. \"Chelsea! Snap out of it!\"\n\nBlinking rapidly, Chelsea’s eyes gradually focused. Color slowly returned to her face as confusion took over. She looked around, disoriented, before finally recognizing me.\n\n\"Wha…what…why am I in the hallway?\" she murmured, touching her forehead and wincing. \"God, I have such a headache. Was I sleepwalking?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure,\" I said uncertainly, my eyes still fixed on her face. \"You were just standing here talking about strange things.\"\n\n\"What things?\" she asked, frowning as she rubbed her temples.\n\nI hesitated before replying, \"About a shadow of death. And the thirteenth floor.\"\n\nHer eyes widened in disbelief. \"I don't remember any of that.\" Glancing at her watch, she gasped, \"Oh God, I'm late! I need to get to work.\" She hurried toward the elevator, then paused and looked back at me with an embarrassed smile. \"Sorry about that. Must’ve been sleepwalking or something. Too many night shifts, you know?\"\n\nBefore I could utter a word, Chelsea disappeared around the corner toward the elevator, and I stood frozen in the hallway, my mind racing. The coincidence was too overwhelming, Mrs. Donovan’s experience, my own, and now Chelsea mentioning the same horrors.\n\nLater, at work, I couldn’t focus. Twice, I nearly administered the wrong medication to patients, catching myself just in time. Colleagues asked if I was feeling ill, noting my pallor and distracted state. I blamed it on lack of sleep, which wasn’t entirely untrue.\n\nDuring my lunch break, I sat alone in the hospital cafeteria, picking at a salad that I had no appetite for. I pulled out my phone and searched for information about my building's history. Central Heights had been built in the 1970s and renovated in the early 2000s. Nothing unusual, a standard high-rise apartment building. I scrolled further until I stumbled across an old newspaper article about an architectural controversy during its construction.\n\nThe original plans had included a thirteenth floor, but due to superstition, the developers had labeled it the fourteenth, skipping thirteen altogether. What caught my attention was a small paragraph noting that the chief architect had either gone missing or died mysteriously before construction was completed; his body was never found, either way.\n\nMy hands trembled as I set down my phone. It couldn’t be a mere coincidence.\n\nThe rest of my shift dragged on endlessly. By the time I clocked out, darkness had fallen, and a fine mist hung in the air, diffusing the streetlights into hazy orbs. I considered taking a different route home, maybe even staying at a hotel for the night, but the thought seemed ridiculous in the rational light of the hospital lobby. I pulled my coat tighter around me and stepped out into the night.\n\nThe walk home felt longer than usual, each shadow making my heart skip a beat. When I finally reached my building, I noticed Ray was gone for the day, replaced by a night doorman whose name I couldn’t recall and who barely looked up from his phone as I entered.\n\nI hesitated at the elevator and then decided to head for the stairs, unwilling to risk another encounter. However, when I reached the door to the stairwell, to my shock, it was locked. I turned around and tried to flag down the night doorman, but he had vanished. I looked around, unsure of what to do next, when suddenly the elevator doors opened.\n\nI stared at the vacant elevator, its fluorescent light flickering ever so slightly. The interior was pristine, no white powder, no mysterious buttons, no towering figure, just an ordinary elevator waiting patiently for a passenger.\n\nRational thought urged me to step inside, especially since the stairwell was locked and I needed to get to my apartment. Yet my feet remained rooted to the lobby floor, my body refusing the simple command to move.\n\nA soft chime sounded as the doors began to close. Acting on instinct, I lunged forward, thrusting my arm between the closing doors. They retracted immediately, and I stepped inside, my heart hammering against my ribs.\n\nMy finger hovered over the button panel. Sixteen. I could just press sixteen and go home. But then my eyes were drawn to the space between twelve and fourteen, the unmarked space where thirteen should be.\n\nThe doors closed behind me with a soft thud that, in my heightened state, sounded like the slam of a prison gate. I pressed sixteen quickly, then backed into the corner, watching the numbers illuminate as the elevator began to ascend.\n\nEverything seemed normal at first, and as I ascended I tried to ignore the lingering feeling of dread. I watched the display numbers slowly increase. Then, to my horror, the elevator stopped. It had halted at 12, but the door wouldn’t open. Then the number distorted and went blank, and I felt the elevator creeping up several more feet before stopping on a floor higher than the 12th.\n\nThe door slid open, and there it was. A hooded figure stood in the doorway, impossibly tall, its white coat hanging from skeletal shoulders. I pressed myself against the back wall of the elevator, my scream caught in my throat. White dust swirled around the figure's feet, drifting into the elevator like fog.\n\n\"Please,\" I managed to whisper, though I wasn’t sure what I was begging for.\n\nThe hooded figure bent down and stepped into the elevator. With each step, a noxious cloud of chalky dust spread around it, and I covered my mouth in horror.\n\nIt extended one impossibly long arm, the sleeve falling back to reveal a hand made entirely of bone, gleaming white in the dim light. It reached out with slow, deliberate motion.\n\nI shook my head, tears streaming down my face. \"No,\" I said, my voice growing stronger. \"I won't go with you.\"\n\nThe figure tilted its hooded head, as if puzzled by my refusal. It took a step forward. With every movement, white dust billowed, filling the cramped space with a fine mist that made me cough. A cold emanated from it, an otherworldly chill that penetrated my soul and froze my thoughts.\n\nIts hand moved toward the panel, paused, then withdrew as it stepped back into the opposite corner of the elevator. It stood motionless, waiting for the doors to close.\n\nI couldn’t fathom why it had ignored me, seeming content to ride the elevator up to the 16th floor rather than drag me down into the sepulchral darkness of the 13th.\n\nThe elevator rose without further incident, the floors passing by in terrible silence as I remained breathless and terrified alongside my monstrous companion.\n\nWhen we arrived at the 16th floor, the entity extended an arm as if bidding me to disembark first. Oddly polite, though still utterly horrifying. I took a nervous step forward, scared of moving, yet even more terrified of staying a moment longer with that skeletal nightmare. I crept past the looming figure and eventually broke into a mad sprint down the hall toward my apartment.\n\nI stole one last glance behind me, the thing was gone. Whatever it had been doing on that floor, I couldn’t say, but I felt an urgent need to get inside and hide as quickly as possible. I made it to my door, my heart racing as I fumbled with my keys before throwing myself inside, quickly closing and locking the door before bolting to my bedroom.\n\nThe night stretched on interminably as I huddled beneath my blanket, feeling both foolish and fearful. Part of me knew that the skeletal figure I dreaded wouldn’t materialize in my bedroom or elsewhere in my apartment, yet another part couldn’t shake the unsettling anticipation that it might. As the hours dragged by with no sign of the apparition, I hesitated, relieved yet still anxious, before finally succumbing to an uneasy sleep.\n\nThat sleep, however, was short-lived. I awoke abruptly to a horrible scream that pierced the quiet night. Bolting upright, my heart pounding, I realized the scream wasn’t part of a nightmare. It echoed through the hallway outside my apartment, followed by a heavy thud. I scrambled out of bed, fumbling for my phone as I debated whether to call 911 or hide in the bathroom.\n\nA strange compulsion drew me toward the door instead. I pressed my eye to the peephole, my breath fogging the small glass circle. At first I saw nothing, then movement caught my eye, a figure walking slowly toward the elevator. It was Chelsea. Her movements were unnervingly stiff, limbs jerking slightly with each step as if controlled by invisible strings. Her eyes were wide and vacant, staring straight ahead.\n\nBehind her loomed that same white-robed figure, impossibly tall, its skeletal frame nearly brushing the ceiling. One bone-white hand hovered inches from Chelsea’s back, guiding her without actual contact. White dust billowed with each unearthly step, leaving a trail of chalky footprints on the carpet.\n\n\"Chelsea,\" I whispered, my hand clutching the doorknob. I knew I should open the door, or scream, or do something, but my body refused to move.\n\nChelsea and the figure reached the elevator. The doors slid open without either of them pressing a button, revealing an inky darkness. As they stepped inside, Chelsea’s head turned slowly, mechanically, toward my apartment. Even through the peephole, I could see that her eyes were completely white now, dusted with the same chalky substance trailing behind the hooded figure. Our gazes locked for one terrifying moment before her face went slack again, and she and the figure stepped into the elevator.\n\nThe doors closed with a soft chime that seemed disturbingly ordinary amid the horror. I stumbled backward from the door, my legs giving out as I collapsed onto the floor, my breath coming in short, painful gasps. Chelsea, the figure was taking her to the 13th floor, just as it had tried to take me.\n\nImages of Mrs. Donovan’s death flashed through my mind: found covered in white powder, dead without explanation. I knew I had to do something, I had to help Chelsea.\n\nWith trembling hands, I dialed 911, but the call wouldn’t connect. My phone showed full service, yet the call failed repeatedly. Frustrated, I tossed the useless device onto the couch and scrambled to my feet, pulling on a sweatshirt over my pajamas and shoving my feet into sneakers.\n\nThe rational part of me screamed that I should stay inside, lock the door, and wait until morning. But Chelsea was my neighbor, and I had to try and do something. I grabbed a kitchen knife, fully aware that it would be useless against whatever that thing was, yet clinging to the faint feeling of security it provided.\n\nI flung open the door and stepped out into the hallway, my heart hammering against my ribs. The corridor was empty now, but a ghostly trail of white powder led me to the elevator.\n\nClutching the knife in my sweaty hand, I followed the shimmering, luminescent powder on the carpet. When I reached the elevator, I saw the doors still closed and the indicator light paused between floors.\n\nMy finger hovered over the call button. Was I really doing this? Was I truly going to follow that thing to wherever it had taken Chelsea? Before I could decide, the indicator light began to move again. The elevator was coming back up.\n\nI ducked behind a decorative plant in the corner, crouching low as the elevator chimed its arrival. The doors slid open, revealing an empty car. No sign of Chelsea or the figure, just more of that white powder dusting the floor.\n\nI approached slowly, knife extended before me. The elevator’s interior had a thicker layer of the powder, swirling gently as if disturbed by an unseen breeze. Something compelled me forward, not curiosity, but a desperate need to find Chelsea and rescue her from whatever fate had befallen Mrs. Donovan.\n\nI stepped inside, my shoes leaving prints in the dust. The doors closed behind me, and I realized I hadn’t pressed a button; the panel remained dark.\n\n\"No,\" I whispered to myself. I was too late. The only trace left was the eerie powder shaped like a skeletal finger pressed on the section between the 12 and 14 buttons.\n\nI stepped off that horrific elevator and walked numbly back to my apartment, praying that all of this was just a terrible dream.\n\nThe next day, my greatest fears were confirmed. I rushed downstairs as quickly as I could, and upon emerging in the lobby, I saw the police and paramedics gathered outside the building. My heart sank.\n\nRay was back at his post and, noticing my horrified expression as I appeared in the lobby, he confirmed the truth I had been dreading. With an ashen face, he said in a low voice, \"Found her in the hallway this morning. Just like Mrs. Donovan. No signs of a struggle, no obvious cause.\" Leaning closer and glancing around the empty lobby, he added, \"And that same white powder all over her. The police are saying it might be some kind of toxic substance in the building. They’re bringing in specialists today.\"\n\nI gripped the edge of Ray’s desk to steady myself.\n\n\"Are you alright?\" he asked, concern deepening the lines on his weathered face. \"You look a bit shaken.\"\n\n\"I'm fine,\" I lied, the words tasting like ash in my mouth. \"Just… shocked. I talked to her yesterday. She seemed fine.\"\n\nRay nodded solemnly. \"They’re saying it might be some kind of chemical hazard. Management's called an emergency meeting tonight, they are trying not to freak people out.\" He hesitated then added quietly, \"Between you and me, I've been working here for sixteen years. I've never seen anything like this. Two people in one week, under the same mysterious circumstances.\"\n\n\"Has anyone else reported anything unusual?\" I asked in a barely audible whisper. \"Anything about the building? The elevator?\"\n\nRay’s expression shifted subtly. \"Funny you should ask. Mrs. Henderson from 1214 mentioned something about the elevator stopping on a floor that doesn't exist.\" He shook his head. \"I told her she must have pressed the wrong button or imagined it. You know, thirteenth floor superstition gets to people. This building is old enough to have its quirks.\"\n\nI nodded mechanically; someone else had seen it. I wasn’t losing my mind.\n\n\"Ray,\" I said carefully, \"have you ever noticed anything strange about the elevator? White powder maybe? Or unusual people using it late at night?\"\n\nRay’s eyes sharpened as he studied me. \"Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"Just curious,\" I offered, my attempt at casual conversation failing miserably.\n\nGlancing around once more, Ray motioned for me to lean closer. \"There have been stories about this building for years,\" he whispered. \"Back in the 70s, during construction, workers refused to continue after dark. They said they saw things. Management called it superstition and fired anyone who complained.\" He paused before adding, \"The architect went missing and the foreman died before it was finished, found in the elevator shaft between what would have been the 13th floor.\"\n\n\"Covered in white powder,\" I murmured, finishing for him.\n\nHis eyes widened, and he nodded slowly.\n\nFor a long, heavy moment, Ray was silent. Finally, he sighed, his shoulders slumping. \"I've worked here for thirty years. I’ve seen residents come and go. I’ve watched this building age. Three years ago, the night janitor quit without notice, left his keys, his uniform, everything. He just disappeared. Before he left, he told me something I’ve never forgotten.\" He swallowed hard. \"He said he’d seen Death itself in the service elevator, wearing a heavy white coat.\"\n\nA chill ran down my spine. \"And did you believe him?\"\n\n\"I didn’t,\" Ray admitted. \"I thought he was hitting the bottle too hard. But then…\" He trailed off, glancing toward the bank of elevators. \"I’ve seen things too. Glimpses. Shadows where there shouldn’t be shadows.\"\n\n\"Why haven’t you left?\" I asked quietly.\n\nRay’s expression hardened. \"This is my home. It has been for a long time. Whatever’s happening, I’m not letting it chase me away.\" He straightened, returning to his professional demeanor. \"You should be careful. Maybe stay with family for a few days until they figure out what’s going on.\"\n\nI nodded, though I knew no investigation would uncover the truth. What was happening defied all rational explanation.\n\n\"Thank you, Ray,\" I said, turning toward the door. \"I'll be careful.\"\n\nI briefly considered taking the day off from work, but I decided against it since I figured I could use the distraction to ignore the insanity swirling around me there.\n\nAt the busy hospital, I almost forgot the horrors of the night before. But as my shift ended, the dread of returning home settled over me.\n\nI lingered for a while, making small talk with colleagues who were just starting their shifts, anything to delay the inevitable.\n\nOutside, twilight had fallen. The streets were quieter than usual, or perhaps it only seemed so to me as each echoing footstep counted down the moments until I got back to my home.\n\nCentral Heights loomed ahead, its windows lit against the darkening sky. How many residents had no idea what lurked between the floors? How many came and went, oblivious to the horror stalking the hallways at night?\n\nAs I approached the entrance, I noticed a small crowd gathered outside. Police tape cordoned off part of the sidewalk, and officers were speaking with some residents. An ambulance idled nearby, lights off but doors open.\n\n\"What's happening?\" I asked a pale-faced woman hovering at the edge of the crowd.\n\nThe woman turned and said in a shaky tone, \"Another one. Mrs. Henderson from 1214. Found her in the stairwell about an hour ago.\"\n\nMy blood ran cold. Mrs. Henderson, the same woman Ray had mentioned, who’d seen the thirteenth floor. My legs nearly gave way.\n\n\"White powder?\" I asked, already dreading the answer.\n\nShe nodded. \"That's what they're saying. Just like the others. Three deaths in one week. People are talking about moving out.\"\n\nI pushed through the crowd toward the entrance. Ray wasn’t at his post, probably being questioned by the police and the other night doorman looked visibly shaken.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" he called as I passed. \"They’re advising residents to stay elsewhere tonight if possible. Building management is putting people up at the Coventry Hotel until they determine if there’s an environmental hazard.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" I mumbled in a terrified daze. I wasn’t in any mood to argue. I headed for the Coventry Hotel, hoping for a night’s safety away from the building and its haunting specter of death.\n\nAfter checking into my room, my mind whirled with doubt and fear. The terrifying enigma of Central Heights dominated my thoughts, compelling me to consider leaving. Whatever was happening in that building, be it a deadly hallucinogenic powder or the grim specter of death itself, it did not matter anymore. I had to get out. The urge to flee was overwhelming, though a small, nagging part of me hesitated at the idea of abandoning the familiar for the unknown. I didn’t have much money, and while I could potentially find a smaller place and hire movers to leave that cursed building behind, the decision felt more daunting than ever.\n\nI eventually resolved to leave and find someplace else to live. It was a hasty decision, but I grimly speculated that it might be a life or death situation, and I shuddered at the thought of the people I knew who had already been taken.\n\nWith that resolution, I tried to settle down, and at last, I fell into a relatively comfortable sleep.\n\nThen, as if in the very next moment, my eyes snapped open in a flash. To my horror, I was alone in the elevator. White dust was everywhere, on the floor, swirling in the air, coating my skin. The numbers on the panel flickered, and a single glowing button remained: 13. I hadn’t pressed it, but the elevator moved anyway, descending to a floor that shouldn’t exist.\n\nWhen the doors opened, I didn’t see a hallway but a vast, cavernous space. White dust drifted like snow in stagnant air. In the center stood that hooded figure, even taller than before, its skeletal hands extended toward me. At its feet lay three bodies, Mrs. Donovan, Chelsea, and Mrs. Henderson, their skin bleached white, eyes open yet unseeing.\n\nBehind the figure, more shapes emerged from the swirling dust. Dozens, hundreds of them, all victims of the thing that dwelled between floors. And it was waiting for me to join them.\n\nDespite my overwhelming horror, a strange compulsion tugged at me, defying all logic. Before I could resist, my feet moved on their own, carrying me toward the morbid sight.\n\nThe doors closed behind me with a metallic groan, and in the distance, I heard the faint hum of the retreating elevator, leaving me alone with that enigmatic figure. It moved ahead, its long coat dragging along the floor and leaving a trail of white, chalky dust. In a daze, I followed, as the oppressive silence wrapped around me like a shroud.\n\nThe hallway seemed to stretch on endlessly, its walls lined with doors that bore no resemblance to those in my own building. They were older, heavier, each adorned with strange symbols that pulsed faintly in the dim light.\n\nAbruptly, the figure halted, tilting its head slightly as if straining to listen to something. I strained my ears, desperate to catch any sound, but only near silence met me. Then, almost imperceptibly at first, I began to hear a faint whisper, soft and indistinct, steadily growing louder. The sound sent shivers down my spine, completely out of place in that world.\n\nThe figure turned to face me, and for the first time, I noticed a subtle movement beneath its hood; shadows twisted and writhed within. My breath caught as the figure raised a hand, its impossibly long, pale fingers pointing toward a door at the far end of the hall.\n\nAs the whisper grew clearer, a jolt of terror struck me when I heard my name called repeatedly in a voice disturbingly familiar. The door at the end of the hall creaked open by itself, revealing a space bathed in eerie, flickering light. I took a hesitant step back, but it was too late. The figure seized my arm with a cold, unyielding grip and pulled me forward. I stumbled toward the open door as the whispers crescendoed into a deafening roar, and in that moment, I stepped through the threshold into a nightmare from which I might never awake.\n\nAnd yet, I did wake, gasping and tangled in sweat-soaked sheets. The hotel room was dark except for the red glow of the digital clock reading 3:13 AM. My heart pounded painfully against my ribs as I fumbled for the bedside lamp.\n\nLight flooded the room, revealing ordinary hotel furnishings. No dust. No figures. Just a bland room with standard artwork and heavy curtains drawn against the night.\n\nI collapsed back onto the pillows, trying to slow my breathing. It had just been a nightmare. But as I glanced toward the carpet near the door, I saw a fine white powder dusting the threshold, as if someone, or something had tried to enter. Frozen, I stared at the white trace. It hadn’t been there when I checked in.\n\nThen, a sinking dread gripped me. My eyes darted down to my feet, now engulfed in a thick layer of the eerie chalky substance. Panic surged as I bent to touch my foot, and there it was, a bruise, vivid and sinister, marking the exact spot where an otherworldly hand had seized my arm with unyielding force. Desperation clawed at my mind as I scrambled for a shred of logic, but only chaos answered.\n\nThe figure had found me. Even here, miles from Central Heights, it had tracked me down. Or perhaps I had even ventured into its lair in my sleep.\n\nIt couldn’t be real. But the powder by the door and on my feet was real. The deaths were real. And whatever was hunting me wouldn’t stop until it had claimed me too.\n\nI hurriedly dressed, hands shaking as I stuffed my few belongings into a bag. I knew I had to leave, to put as much distance as possible between myself and everything here. I crossed several state lines and did not have a destination, besides as far away as I could get from that nightmare and the being that might even now still be searching for me.\n\nYet, even abandoning my possessions and leaving, doubt still gnaws at my resolve. Perhaps leaving the city entirely and abandoning everything might be enough. But deep down, I wonder whether it could ever be enough. I don’t know if I can ever outrun the shadow of death itself, that haunts the 13th floor…"},"96":{"title":"I’m Everyone’s Favorite Person. Too Bad I Don’t Exist.

Not metaphor. I mean, I don’t think I exist in the real world.\n\nI am increasingly convinced that I am trapped in my own body, but I have no control on it. There is someone or something that controlling it. I am just stuck inside, like a typo someone decided to keep.\n\nEverything is too good. Everyone is too nice. Everyone insists I am too perfect. In fact, even everything that I have written seems too correct, as if it is edited or written by ChatGPT.\n\nI always had this nagging feeling of something being off, but this disconnect has become too glaring since the day after the presentation I didn’t give.\n\nCarol from marketing caught me in the corridor, eyes glittering with admiration I didn’t earn.  \n“You were electric yesterday,” she said. “Seriously. The room was buzzing.”\n\nI blinked.\n\n“I wasn’t here yesterday.”\n\nShe tilted her head like a confused puppy.  \n“Yeah, yeah—humble genius routine. Classic you.”\n\nThe thought of a puppy tilting its head made me smile.\n\nShe thought I’d smiled at her.\n\nShe walked off before I could correct her. Which was fine. I wouldn’t have known what to say anyway.\n\nI couldn’t prove I hadn’t been there.\n\nI couldn’t prove where I *had* been.\n\nLater, I found a lunch receipt in my pocket—somewhere called *Pho Real.* Clever. I’d never been there. Apparently, I had the tofu banh mi. I don’t eat tofu. Or banh mi.\n\nAnd seriously? *“Banh me”?*\n\nI think that was a message.\n\nMy stomach hurt. That hollow burn like hunger, except deeper. Not empty. Erased.\n\nI opened the slide deck everyone kept talking about. *Quarterly Forecast, v5 FINAL FINAL SERIOUSLY FINAL*.  \nThe title slide had my name. My title. The color scheme I never use. I flipped through.\n\nIt was… good. Witty, clean, persuasive. Exactly the kind of work I wish I was capable of.\n\nI stared at it too long. My eyes stung. Not from brightness. From *recognition.*  \nIt sounded like me—but a better me. A *deliberate* me.\n\nThat’s when it got weird. Or weirder.\n\nA calendar ping went off. “1-on-1 with Shweta.”  \nI didn’t know I had one. I didn’t know what to say. But I showed up. And she was already there.\n\n“I just wanted to thank you,” she said.\n\n“For what?”\n\nShe laughed like I was flirting. “You’re too much.”\n\nShe meant it warmly. But her face—the *part* of her face that meant it—felt detached. Like a sticker poorly aligned with the rest of her expression.\n\nWhen she left, I touched the desk. The laminate felt cold to my hands. My hands felt cold to me. like the room had been recently vacated. I sat there for five minutes and tried to feel real.\n\nNothing.\n\nI went home early. The walk was odd. Each step felt identical—same rhythm, same distance. Then I was pressing the elevator button. Then I was unlocking my door.\n\nInside: order. Neatness. My handwriting on the grocery list. Almond milk, tuna, body wash.\n\nI stared at it. Almond milk gives me gas. Tuna gives me hives. And I haven't used body wash since I moved out of my parents’ place.\n\nI checked my phone. There were three texts from my sister.\n\n>“Thanks for sorting Mom’s surgery. Lifesaver.”  \n“You’ve always been the strong one.”  \n“Hope you’re getting rest.”\n\nI called her.\n\n“What surgery?” I asked.\n\nA pause. Too long.\n\n“Wait—are you okay?”\n\n“No. I mean, yes. I just… I don’t remember doing any of that.”\n\nAnother pause. Then her voice softened.\n\n“Maybe you’re burned out. You’ve been doing so much for everyone.”\n\nShe sounded sad.\n\nOr maybe scared.\n\nI didn’t know for whom.\n\nThat night, I opened my old journal. I used to write in it when I needed to remind myself that time was real. That days had shape.\n\nLast entry:\n\n“Nothing feels like anything. Like I’m a blurred photo. I’m here, but I’m not in it.”\n\nDated twenty-one days ago. The pages after that were blank. Except one. Where, in neat handwriting, someone had written:\n\n“You’re doing great. Keep going.”\n\nI touched the ink. Fresh. Not mine.\n\nI tried to eat dinner. Couldn’t. I wasn’t hungry. I wasn’t full. I wasn’t anything.\n\nLater, I took a long shower. I stood there until the water turned cold and my fingers pruned. I looked at myself in the mirror. Stared into my eyes for signs of misalignment. Checked if my mouth moved the same way as my thoughts.\n\nIt did. Too well.\n\nThen I went to sleep on the couch, under a blanket I didn’t remember owning, surrounded by things I’d apparently chosen.\n\nI woke up with a dull ache in my jaw. I must’ve been grinding my teeth again.  \nThe kind of ache you only get from clenching through dreams you don’t remember.\n\nAlso—it was 8:10 AM. I don’t oversleep. I haven’t in years. I’ve trained myself to wake up at 6:45 like some anxious rooster. But this morning? Nothing. No alarm. No memory.\n\nI walked into the kitchen. The fridge had a sticky note on it: **“You matter.”**\n\nThe handwriting was round, careful. Not mine.\n\nTaped just below it was a receipt for almond milk.\n\nTime-stamped **7:03 AM.**"},"97":{"title":"We put trail cams all over the mountain.

Leaving our home in England, we would road trip through Scotland, before taking a ferry across the Irish sea. Driving a further three hours through the last frontier of the United Kingdom, my two older brothers and I would know when we were close to our relatives’ farm, because the country roads would suddenly turn bumpy as hell.  \n\nThe north-west of Ireland is a breath-taking part of the country. Its Atlantic coast way is wild and rugged, with pastoral green hills and misty mountains. The villages are very traditional, surrounded by numerous farms, cow and sheep fields. \n\nMy family and I would always stay at my grandmother’s farmhouse, which stands out a mile away, due its bright, red-painted coating. These relatives are from my mother’s side, and although the north-west – and even the rest of Ireland for that matter, is very sparsely populated, my mother’s family is extremely large. She has a dozen siblings, which was always mind-blowing to me – and what’s more, I have so many cousins, I’ve yet to meet them all. \n\nI always enjoyed these summer holidays on the farm, where I would spend every day playing around the grounds and feeding the different farm animals. Although I usually played with my two older brothers on the farm, by the time I was twelve, they were too old to play with me, and would rather go round to one of our cousin’s houses nearby - to either ride dirt bikes or play video games. So, I was mostly stuck on the farm by myself. Luckily, I had one cousin, Grainne, who lived close by and was around my age. Grainne was a tom-boy, and so we more or less liked the same activities.  \n\nI absolutely loved it here, and so did my brothers and my dad. In fact, we loved the north-west of Ireland so much, we even talked about moving here. But, for some strange reason, although my mum was always missing her family, she was dead against any ideas of relocating. Whenever we asked her why, she would always have a different answer: there weren’t enough jobs, it’s too remote, and so on... But unfortunately for my mum, we always left the family decisions to a majority vote, and so, if the four out of five of us wanted to relocate to the north-west of Ireland, we were going to. \n\nOn one of these summer evenings on the farm, and having neither my brothers or Grainne to play with, my Uncle Dave - who ran the family farm, asks me if I’d like to come with him to see a baby calf being born on one of the nearby farms. Having never seen a new-born calf before, I enthusiastically agreed to tag along. Driving for ten minutes down the bumpy country road, we pull outside the entrance of a rather large cow field - where, waiting for my Uncle Dave, were three other farmers. Knowing how big my Irish family was, I assumed I was probably related to these men too. Getting out of the car, these three farmers stare instantly at me, appearing both shocked and angry. Striding up to my Uncle Dave, one of the farmers yells at him, ‘What the hell’s this wain doing here?!’ \n\nTaken back a little by the hostility, I then hear my Uncle Dave reply, ‘He needs to know! You know as well as I do they can’t move here!’ \n\nFeeling rather uncomfortable by this confrontation, I was now somewhat confused. What do I need to know? And more importantly, why can’t we move here? \n\nBefore I can turn to Uncle Dave to ask him, the four men quickly halt their bickering and enter through the field gate entrance. Following the men into the cow field, the late-evening had turned dark by now, and not wanting to ruin my good trainers by stepping in any cowpats, I walked very cautiously and slowly – so slow in fact, I’d gotten separated from my uncle's group. Trying to follow the voices through the darkness and thick grass, I suddenly stop in my tracks, because in front of me, staring back with unblinking eyes, was a very large cow – so large, I at first mistook it for a bull. In the past, my Uncle Dave had warned me not to play in the cow fields, because if cows are with their calves, they may charge at you. \n\nSeeing this huge cow, staring stonewall at me, I really was quite terrified – because already knowing how freakishly fast cows can be, I knew if it charged at me, there was little chance I would outrun it. Thankfully, the cow stayed exactly where it was, before losing interest in me and moving on. I know it sounds ridiculous talking about my terrifying encounter with a cow, but I was a city boy after all. Although I regularly feds the cows on the family farm, these animals still felt somewhat alien to me, even after all these years.  \n\nBrushing off my close encounter, I continue to try and find my Uncle Dave. I eventually found them on the far side of the field’s corner. Approaching my uncle’s group, I then see they’re not alone. Standing by them were three more men and a woman, all dressed in farmer’s clothing. But surprisingly, my cousin Grainne was also with them. I go over to Grainne to say hello, but she didn’t even seem to realize I was there. She was too busy staring over at something, behind the group of farmers. Curious as to what Grainne was looking at, I move around to get a better look... and what I see is another cow – just a regular red cow, laying down on the grass. Getting out my phone to turn on the flashlight, I quickly realize this must be the cow that was giving birth. Its stomach was swollen, and there were patches of blood stained on the grass around it... But then I saw something else... \n\nOn the other side of this red cow, nestled in the grass beneath the bushes, was the calf... and rather sadly, it was stillborn... But what greatly concerned me, wasn’t that this calf was dead. What concerned me was its appearance... Although the calf’s head was covered in red, slimy fur, the rest of it wasn’t... The rest of it didn’t have any fur at all – just skin... And what made every single fibre of my body crawl, was that this calf’s body – its brittle, infant body... It belonged to a human... \n\nCurled up into a foetal position, its head was indeed that of a calf... But what I should have been seeing as two front and hind legs, were instead two human arms and legs - no longer or shorter than my own... \n\nFeeling terrified and at the same time, in disbelief, I leave the calf, or whatever it was to go back to Grainne – all the while turning to shine my flashlight on the calf, as though to see if it still had the same appearance. Before I can make it back to the group of adults, Grainne stops me. With a look of concern on her face, she stares silently back at me, before she says, ‘You’re not supposed to be here. It was supposed to be a secret.’ \n\nTelling her that Uncle Dave had brought me, I then ask what the hell that thing was... ‘I’m not allowed to tell you’ she says. ‘This was supposed to be a secret.’ \n\nTwenty or thirty-so minutes later, we were all standing around as though waiting for something - before the lights of a vehicle pull into the field and a man gets out to come over to us. This man wasn’t a farmer - he was some sort of veterinarian. Uncle Dave and the others bring him to tend to the calf’s mother, and as he did, me and Grainne were made to wait inside one of the men’s tractors. \n\nWe sat inside the tractor for what felt like hours. Even though it was summer, the night was very cold, and I was only wearing a soccer jersey and shorts. I tried prying Grainne for more information as to what was going on, but she wouldn’t talk about it – or at least, wasn’t allowed to talk about it. Luckily, my determination for answers got the better of her, because more than an hour later, with nothing but the cold night air and awkward silence to accompany us both, Grainne finally gave in... \n\n‘This happens every couple of years - to all the farms here... But we’re not supposed to talk about it. It brings bad luck.’ \n\nI then remembered something. When my dad said he wanted us to move here, my mum was dead against it. If anything, she looked scared just considering it... Almost afraid to know the answer, I work up the courage to ask Grainne... ‘Does my mum know about this?’ \n\nSat stiffly in the driver’s seat, Grainne cranes her neck round to me. ‘Of course she knows’ Grainne reveals. ‘Everyone here knows.’ \n\nIt made sense now. No wonder my mum didn’t want to move here. She never even seemed excited whenever we planned on visiting – which was strange to me, because my mum clearly loved her family. \n\nI then remembered something else... A couple of years ago, I remember waking up in the middle of the night inside the farmhouse, and I could hear the cows on the farm screaming. The screaming was so bad, I couldn’t even get back to sleep that night... The next morning, rushing through my breakfast to go play on the farm, Uncle Dave firmly tells me and my brothers to stay away from the cowshed... He didn’t even give an explanation. \n\nLater on that night, after what must have been a good three hours, my Uncle Dave and the others come over to the tractor. Shaking Uncle Dave’s hand, the veterinarian then gets in his vehicle and leaves out the field. I then notice two of the other farmers were carrying a black bag or something, each holding separate ends as they walked. I could see there was something heavy inside, and my first thought was they were carrying the dead calf – or whatever it was, away. Appearing as though everyone was leaving now, Uncle Dave comes over to the tractor to say we’re going back to the farmhouse, and that we would drop Grainne home along the way.  \n\nHaving taken Grainne home, we then make our way back along the country road, where both me and Uncle Dave sat in complete silence. Uncle Dave driving, just staring at the stretch of road in front of us – and me, staring silently at him. \n\nBy the time we get back to the farmhouse, it was two o’clock in the morning – and the farm was dead silent. Pulling up outside the farm, Uncle Dave switches off the car engine. Without saying a word, we both remain in silence. I felt too awkward to ask him what I had just seen, but I knew he was waiting for me to do so. Still not saying a word to one another, Uncle Dave turns from the driver’s seat to me... and he tells me everything Grainne wouldn’t... \n\n‘Don’t you see now why you can’t move here?’ he says. ‘There’s something wrong with this place, son. This place is cursed. Your mammy knows. She’s known since she was a wain. That’s why she doesn’t want you living here.’ \n\n‘Why does this happen?’ I ask him. \n\n‘This has been happening for generations, son. For hundreds of years, the animals in the county have been giving birth to these things.’ The way my Uncle Dave was explaining all this to me, it was almost like a confession – like he’d wanted to tell the truth about what’s been happening here all his life... ‘It’s not just the cows. It’s the pigs. The sheep. The horses, and even the dogs’... \n\nThe dogs? \n\n‘It’s always the same. They have the head, as normal, but the body’s always different.’ \n\nIt was only now, after a long and terrifying night, that I suddenly started to become emotional - that and I was completely exhausted. Realizing this was all too much for a young boy to handle, I think my Uncle Dave tried to put my mind at ease...  \n\n‘Don’t you worry, son... They never live.’ \n\nAlthough I wanted all the answers, I now felt as though I knew far too much... But there was one more thing I still wanted to know... What do they do with the bodies? \n\n‘Don’t you worry about it, son. Just tell your mammy that you know – but don’t go telling your brothers or your daddy now... She never wanted them knowing.’ \n\nBy the next morning, and constantly rethinking everything that happened the previous night, I look around the farmhouse for my mum. Thankfully, she was alone in her bedroom folding clothes, and so I took the opportunity to talk to her in private. Entering her room, she asks me how it was seeing a calf being born for the first time. Staring back at her warm smile, my mouth opens to make words, but nothing comes out – and instantly... my mum knows what’s happened. \n\n‘I could kill your Uncle Dave!’ she says. ‘He said it was going to be a normal birth!’ \n\nBreaking down in tears right in front of her, my mum comes over to comfort me in her arms. \n\n‘’It’s ok, chicken. There’s no need to be afraid.’ \n\nAfter she tried explaining to me what Grainne and Uncle Dave had already told me, her comforting demeanour suddenly turns serious... Clasping her hands upon each side of my arms, my mum crouches down, eyes-level with me... and with the most serious look on her face I’d ever seen, she demands of me, ‘Listen chicken... Whatever you do, don’t you dare go telling your brothers or your dad... They can never know. It’s going to be our little secret. Ok?’ \n\nStill with tears in my eyes, I nod a silent yes to her. ‘Good man yourself’ she says.  \n\nWe went back home to England a week later... I never told my brothers or my dad the truth of what I saw – of what really happens on those farms... And I refused to ever step foot inside the north-west of Ireland again... \n\nBut here’s the thing... I recently went back to Ireland, years later in my adulthood... and on my travels, I learned my mum and Uncle Dave weren’t telling me the whole truth...  \n\nThis curse... It wasn’t regional... And sometimes...  \n\n...They do live. "},"99":{"title":"The blue room","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k7deyp\/the_blue_room\/","flair":null,"author":"im_brudakku-2","selftext":"I never saw his face. Not once. That fact alone haunts me more than anything else. His voice was always calm. Measured. Almost polite, which made it worse somehow. He never raised it. Never cursed. Just quiet instructions and the scent of bleach.\n\nI remember the day he took me with unnerving clarity, like a scene scratched into the back of my eyes. It was raining hard. I’d just left the coffee shop near campus, umbrella forgotten at the counter. I remember fumbling with my phone to order a ride, then a gloved hand over my mouth. The sensation of cold metal pressing against my temple. My scream drowned in my throat.\n\nWhen I woke up, I was lying on a thin mattress inside a windowless room painted entirely blue. Floor to ceiling. Blue walls, blue ceiling, blue sheets. A single light bulb buzzed above me. The air smelled stale and chemical, like old paint and something sour underneath. I was still in my jeans and hoodie, but my shoes were gone.\n\nThere was a door with no handle on the inside. A small camera in the corner blinked a red light at me. He watched. I knew it immediately. I stared at that lens for hours, waiting for something to happen. When I tried to scream, the sound felt swallowed by the blue around me.\n\nThe first time he spoke, it came through a speaker hidden somewhere in the ceiling.\n\nYou will not be harmed if you follow the rules.\n\nHis voice was neither old nor young. Just… blank. Like he’d stripped it of personality on purpose. I asked him who he was, what he wanted. I begged. Cursed. Promised him anything if he’d let me go. Silence. Then the voice again.\n\nRule one. Do not tamper with the door. Rule two. You will eat when the light turns green. Rule three. You will sleep when the light turns red.\n\nThe light never turned off entirely. Just changed color. When it glowed green, a tray slid through a narrow opening near the floor. Usually oatmeal, sometimes something that looked like meatloaf. It didn’t matter. I ate it. Hunger won every time.\n\nThe days blurred together. I lost track of time. There was no clock, no natural light. I started naming the cracks in the ceiling. Whispering stories to myself to remember the sound of my own voice.\n\nBut always, always, I watched that camera. Waiting.\n\nThe first time I broke the rules, I did it out of desperation. I waited until the light turned red and pretended to sleep. Then I pried at the edges of the tray slot with a piece of bent plastic from the food container. The slot was spring-loaded, and the metal cut my fingers. Still, I kept at it.\n\nI don’t know how long passed before I felt the change in the air. Like a presence had filled the room. Then the voice returned, quiet but firm.\n\nYou have broken a rule.\n\nBefore I could react, the light turned white—blinding white. Pain shot through my head. I screamed, covering my face, but the light only grew brighter. My skin felt like it was burning. I curled into a ball and sobbed until it finally dimmed and turned red again.\n\nYou will not be warned again.\n\nI didn’t touch the slot after that. Not for weeks.\n\nBut something shifted in me that day. He wanted obedience. He wanted routine. That was his mistake. If I could predict him, I could break him. So I watched. Every gesture, every meal, every color change. I memorized the timing. I counted seconds between the tray sliding in and the camera lens shifting focus. I noticed it turned off for three seconds each time he delivered food.\n\nThree seconds. Not much. But just enough.\n\nThe next time the light turned green, I was ready.\n\nI took the plastic fork from the tray and wedged it under the edge of the camera. My hands trembled as I worked fast, biting my lip so hard I tasted blood. I managed to snap the lens just before the red light blinked back on. I dropped the fork and backed into the corner, heart racing so hard I thought I’d pass out.\n\nNo voice. No punishment. Just silence.\n\nThe camera stayed dark.\n\nThe next day, no food came. No voice. No light change. Just endless, crushing blue.\n\nThat was the worst day of my life. Not because of hunger or fear, but because I realized he was punishing me by taking himself away. I’d begun to expect him, depend on his rhythm. Without it, I unraveled. He knew that. He wanted me to miss him.\n\nI screamed then. I pounded on the door, clawed at the walls, sobbed until my throat bled. I begged him to come back. To talk. To do something.\n\nThat night, the light turned green. The tray returned. And the voice said,\n\nGood.\n\nHe had broken me. But in breaking, I saw the cracks.\n\nI changed after that. I pretended better. I followed the rules. Ate when I was told. Slept on command. I became obedient, quiet, predictable. I gave him what he wanted—until the day he made his first mistake.\n\nIt was small. Stupid, even. A noise behind the wall. Like a cough. It was human, and it didn’t belong.\n\nI pressed my ear to the wall. Nothing. Then again, softer this time. A shuffle. A breath. Someone else was there.\n\nI tapped on the wall, slow and rhythmic. Three knocks. Waited. Then it came back.\n\nThree knocks.\n\nI wasn’t alone.\n\nEvery day, we tapped. We developed a code. A crude alphabet based on numbers and taps. It took days, maybe weeks, but we began to talk. Her name was Lisa. She’d been there longer. Much longer. She warned me he liked games. Psychological ones. That he changed rooms. That no one stayed in the Blue Room forever.\n\nThat scared me more than anything.\n\nThe night the light turned red and didn’t change for hours, I knew something was coming. I didn’t sleep. I crouched near the tray slot with the bent fork hidden in my sleeve. My heart pounded so loud it drowned out everything.\n\nThen I heard it.\n\nThe door. Clicking open.\n\nHe was coming in.\n\nI lay still, pretending to sleep, barely breathing. I heard footsteps, slow and deliberate. A faint rustle. He was doing something with the camera. Replacing it. I could smell his cologne. Sharp and synthetic.\n\nThen, without warning, I leapt.\n\nI jammed the fork into the back of his thigh. He screamed—a real, raw scream—and I scrambled through his legs, bolting for the open door. He grabbed my ankle, but I kicked hard, adrenaline turning me into something wild and primal.\n\nI ran down a narrow hallway lit by flickering bulbs. Doors lined each side, all painted different colors. Blue. Green. Yellow. Red. I passed them all. I heard him stumbling behind me, shouting now. Angry. The calm voice was gone. This was the real him.\n\nI reached a metal staircase and flew up it, taking two steps at a time. My lungs burned. My bare feet slapped the stairs so hard they bled.\n\nAt the top—another door. This one had a keypad.\n\nI froze.\n\nThen I remembered Lisa’s taps. The numbers she gave me over the last few days. A date. Her son’s birthday.\n\nOne. Nine. Zero. Five.\n\nThe light turned green.\n\nThe door creaked open to a blinding light. Cold air rushed in, and I saw stars. Real stars, in a real sky. I ran into the night, into the dark forest beyond.\n\nI didn’t stop.\n\nEventually, a trucker found me on the road, half-conscious and covered in dirt and blood. I told them everything. The police searched for weeks. They found the house. Empty. The rooms repainted. The cameras gone. No trace of him. No Lisa.\n\nJust one thing left behind.\n\nA single blue wall. And a message carved into it with something sharp.\n\nYou followed the rules.\nYou were fun.\n\nI never saw his face. I never want to. But I know he’s still out there.\n\nWatching.\n\nWaiting.\n\nChoosing his next color."},"196":{"title":"I moved into my family home...

There were acres of forest around and I loved it there. No annoying car sounds, no disturbing bright lights and lastly no people. You could be completely alone without anyone bothering you. You could do anything you want without anyone telling you that you can’t. \n\n\nIt had one big house called the main house and a smaller building for storage.\n\nAs a kid I went there every summer. I wanted to spend even more time there than just a couple of weeks in the summer but at that time it was not possible. Living there was my biggest dream as a kid. \n\nAs a teenager I was well you could say disturbed but I prefer unique. I enjoyed spending time in the forest and the best time for being there was at night. I loved the forest day and night. I loved animals living or dead as death is a part of life you just have to accept. And that’s why people thought that I was disturbed. I wanted to live in our cabin in the woods. All by myself.\n\nA couple of years later I turned 18 and finally was able to move into that cottage. It was awesome. I could walk in the forest anytime I wanted. I had many pets and farm animals. Chickens, goats, two cats and a guard dog..I built a coop for the chickens and an enclosure for the goats.I loved it there, until I started hearing these weird noises coming from outside. \n\nI kept hearing this scratching sound every night. My dog heard it too and he usually barked a few times and it stopped. It was weird. There were no signs of scratching when I checked the porch out when it was morning. I was a tiny bit scared. Not much because I loved the forest around my property and \nI was quite sure that it was just some animal trying to come inside the house. \n\nOne day I was going to feed the animals and then I saw them, scratch marks! On the garage building's main entrance. They were huge. I had seen scratch marks made by a bear before but these were different. The door was maybe 2 meters high and 70 centimeters wide. There were three scratches made with what looked like a claw or something like that. They were 5 centimeters wide and went from the top of the door to the bottom. At first I thought it was a bear or that’s what I kept telling myself to not freak out. In reality I knew it couldn’t have been a bear. \n\nThe next night I couldn’t fall asleep and I started hearing scratching again. My heart was beating fast and I started to sweat. I was terrified of what was scratching outside. I went and got my gun. I had a shotgun left behind by my grandfather who loved to hunt. It was old but I kept it clean and practiced shooting with it. I peeped through my curtains and there was this dark, weird looking figure standing by the door to my garage. I thought it was a bear and was relieved but then it turned and looked in my direction. I got spooked and closed the curtains. What I saw couldn’t have been a bear. It was tall. Over 2 meters tall. Standing like a human.\n\n It had glowing yellow eyes. That’s all I could see before I got spooked. I went to bed shaking. I was grabbing and cuddling the shotgun. I was terrified. I felt like a baby scared of the woods cuddling a shotgun. “What a pussy” I thought. This time my dog didn’t bark, weird.\n\n I remember waking up to the sun rising and shining through the curtains. It was morning. I thought How could I fall asleep? All my animals could be gone. Eaten by the thing outside.\nI quickly rose up, changed my clothes and went outside to check the animals. All the chickens were there and they were doing well. Then I checked the goats and one was missing. They were screaming like hell. They were obviously spooked by something. Then I checked my dog. He was inside with me all night but I had to check since he usually barks when the scratching is happening and this time he didn’t. There he was smiling and wagging his tail. He seemed normal. Later that day I found a goat's head impaled by a pine branch. Rest of the goat's body was scattered around my yard and I found its limbs severed and in different places. All the body parts were chewed. They were torn apart by something and eaten, although not completely. It was weird, I wanted to get the hell out of there but that was my home and it had been in my family for ages. \n\nI went inside and tried researching the creature online but nothing. Then I remembered that there was this cabinet in the storage building that I was not allowed to look inside as a kid. My Eyes widened as I realized that there must be something that could help.\n\n I went inside the storage and there it was the cabinet. It looked older than I remembered. The wood was rotting and the cabinet doors almost fell when I opened it. It had these weird objects inside it. They looked like miniature goat heads. Small and shrunken down. I got shivers going down my spine as I saw a box that had a goat's head symbol on it and some text but it was so old that it had worn off. I opened the box and there was a book and a notepad inside. I opened the book and there was a picture of this creature that I had been seeing. \n\nThere was a text saying ‘’ If you see K…. on this property, you must sacrifice one goat to it every week, on Saturdays at 2 AM. If you don’t it will try to get inside, if it does get inside it will take YOU’’The name of the creature was worn off. \n‘’What the fuck?’’ I said out loud even though I was alone. I read more of the book and there were many pictures of the creature. In different places of the yard. There was this page on the creature and it revealed that my family had been seeing the creature for many years. Its name was written in old letters ‘Kirekh'. I had thought it was a skinwalker but I read many stories on skinwalkers and it definitely was not a skinwalker. It was something else.\n\n The notepad contained instructions on how to do the sacrifice and every sacrifice they had made from 1919 to 2001. That’s when I moved in. I had not made any sacrifices as I didn’t know about it. I was terrified. Terrified of making sacrifices to some creature who could easily kill me. I had this thought about’’ Why didn’t my family tell me about this.’’ I wanted to get the fuck out but I didn’t because it was my family home.\n\nThat day very conveniently happened to be saturday. I had to make the sacrifice. The instructions were clear. I had to take one goat with me to the middle of the woods and leave it on a stone that was placed there by my great great grandfather. I had to wait there until Kirekh took it and went back to the darkness. I had to kneel before it. The instructions said that if you look at Kirekh taking the goat, it will take you as well. \n\nThat night I was anxious and was pacing around my house. Clock was around 1:30 as I started preparing. I put on my boots, took my shotgun and went outside.\n\n It was cold and the wind was howling. It was raining a little and I went to the goat pen and took one goat with me, the oldest goat I had. I said my goodbyes to the goat and told him that he was going to be okay. I don’t know how I would handle the sacrifice, as this goat was mine for 3 years. I had it before I moved here but it had to be done. \n\nThen I started walking towards the woods. I had seen this spot in the woods before so I knew where to go. It was pitch black and all I could hear was the rain and wind. It was so dark out there that I tripped a couple of times on some branches.\n\nI reached my destination. I placed the goat there and told him the last goodbyes. Then I took a few steps back, kneeled and waited. I placed my head on the ground. After what felt like three hours I heard stomping and tree branches snapping. It was distant but coming closer. All of a sudden it was so close that the ground was shaking and the tree branches were falling around the area. I started to hear this heavy breathing. I started to shiver. I was petrified, I almost could not breathe. \nThen I felt a warm breath on my neck and heard Kirekh sniffing me. ‘’ sniff sniff’’. Its breath smelt like rotting meat. What the fuck was going on? I thought. Then it let out the scariest, earth shaking and ear drum piercing scream. ‘’RRRAAAAAAGHH’’ I heard it picking up the goat and it opened its mouth. I could tell that by the smell that appeared out of nowhere. The smell of rotting flesh. I heard him chew a couple of times and then it came over to me.\n\n Kirekh picked me up. It was strong, it felt like my body would snap in half. I was shaking and started to panic. I opened my eyes and saw its face. It was monstrous. A goat's head with horns that were snapped roughly in half. It had sharp teeth and yellow eyes that were looking directly in my soul. I screamed. I started to wiggle and then I fell to the ground. It screamed. \n\nI started to run back to the house. as I ran I looked back and Kirekh was just standing at the site of the sacrifice. Then it started running towards me. I ran for my life. I tripped a couple of times but got back up, it was a life or death situation. I tripped once more and  I broke my ankle when I fell and it hurt like hell. It felt like I couldn’t run anymore but I had to. I was exhausted and ready to give up but finally I reached my house, got in and locked the door. Then I went and grabbed my shotgun and looked out the window. Kirekh was standing outside at the edge of the woods. I couldn’t see him properly but the outline was there. \n\nI decided that it was time to go. I started packing and when I was ready it was already morning. I packed my bags in the truck. took all the animals that could fit in the truck and said goodbyes to the property. I couldn’t handle this anymore. As I was saying goodbyes to the property. I found a goat's head sitting in front of the garage. I took it as a warning. A warning that I had forgotten to make the sacrifices for it. A warning that said You’re next.\n\nI went to my truck and drove off. I couldn’t stop thinking about last night and as I turned to the road that took me away from there. I saw a goat that was placed on a tree branch. It was impaled by the branch and it was definitely placed there by Kirekh. I felt horrible as I thought ‘’ can I even escape?’’ It was clearly following me and that full body of a goat impaled by a tree. This definitely meant that I was next.\n\n\n"},"197":{"title":"The Night of the Living Potatoes","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k72ojw\/the_night_of_the_living_potatoes\/","flair":null,"author":"happycatsforasadgirl","selftext":"'James, come here now! Jesus this is so gross!'\n\nThe call came from the kitchen, Rachel's voice carrying through the thin walls of our house. Hauling myself out of bed, I hurried down to find out what had pissed her off enough to wake me up. I found her standing in the light of the open fridge pulling out a dripping mass from the bottom shelf with a finger and thumb, careful not to get any liquid on the fabric of her coat.\n\n'James you told me that you'd cleaned the fridge out!' She said, holding up the rotten lump like an accusation.\n\nI couldn't deny it. After days of nagging I'd given in yesterday and told her that I'd done it, hoping that she'd not try and look before her business trip. Obviously that hadn't worked, and now I was staring at the floppy carrot of consequences. I thought fast. \n\n'No babe, I meant that I'd get it sorted today! While you're away, I'll clean it all out, scrub it clean and get fresh food in, promise! I just didn't want to waste our last evening together doing it.'\n\nShe wasn't buying it. With an expression colder the fridge she threw the offending vegetable away, then crossed back over to pick out her lunchbag. As she did she let out a cry of disgust before thrusting it out towards me.\n\n'What the hell is this, James?!'\n\nI looked at the thin brown slime staining the side of her bag, and the small, sad potato that clung grimly on to the organic glue. I briefly considered actually guessing what the substance was, but luckily some sense of self preservation kicked in at the last moment.\n\n'My fault babe, it's my fault, I'm sorry.' I said quickly, plucking the semi-rotten tuber off Rachel's food bag and reaching for the kitchen roll. 'Let me sort it.'\n\n'It's foul James, it's just foul.' She said as I did my best to de-slime her lunch.'\n\n'...And it's not what you need just before you leave, I know, I know.' I finished for her, zipping up her lunch bag and offering it back to her. 'I'll fix it babe, I promise.'\n\nShe sighed, and I saw her frustration deflate a little. 'You better. There's something furry on the middle shelf, and the vegetable drawer is like War of the Worlds.'\n\nWith that we got the last of her bits together, and I gallantly wheeled her suitcase to the front door. \n\n'You've got four days James. Don't let me down, okay? I'll call you when I'm at the airport.' She said, giving me a quick peck on the lips. Her coat buttons pressed into the bare skin of my belly.\n\n'Trust me babe, I'll get it done.' I said, giving her one last squeeze as she stepped outside.\n\nHalf-hiding myself behind the door I waved her off, watching her car disappear over the hill towards the airport. The moment it was gone I turned back towards the bedroom, private browsing on my mind and the fridge already forgotten.\n\n***\nFive hours later I wandered into the kitchen for a drink. With my eyes on my phone I didn't see the open fridge door until I'd already headbutted it and sent it bouncing off the counter. I stumbled back and slipped on something cold and slimy, sending me crashing down to the linoleum floor. \n\n'What the fuck!' I shouted at nothing in particular.\n\nAs the pain receded from my forehead and tailbone I opened my eyes and took stock of what had happened. The fridge door was open, the motor inside letting out a chunky-sounding whine, and hanging limply at eye level was a thin, meaty-looking string of some sort. It was looped over the milk in the fridge door, and led all the way down to the bottom of my sock where whatever I'd stepped on was still soaking through. With a faint sense of horror I turned my foot towards me, and saw the remains of a potato the length of my thumb mushed into the fabric. \n\n'Oh that's fucking gross...'\n\nWincing I peeled the half-brown mass off the sole of my foot which disturbed the root or shoot, whatever it is that rotting potatoes grow, and the freezing cold length of it collapsed flaccidly onto my chest and neck. I spasmed in repulsion, flailing at it to get it off my skin as if it was a rubbery spider web, sending it flopping onto the floor. Another shiver went through me and I pulled myself painfully to my feet.\n\nInside the fridge, from a bag of potatoes that I'd bought with the best of cooking intentions, was a bulging mass of thin red strands bursting from the plastic like the questing tendrils of some demonic fungus. A few were like wispy hair, while others were as thick as my little finger with growths and knuckles jutting off the sides. The sheer volume of them had pushed the vegetable drawer open, and presumably the fridge door with it, spilling out the rotten spud I'd slipped on. For a few moments I just stared at the tentacles of plant matter, mind trying to wrap itself around what I was seeing, before I suddenly decided to slam the door shut. The fridge light disappeared, and with it the disgusting sight.\n\n'Nope. Nu-uh, not tonight.' I said to myself, kicking the wet stalk of the crushed potato away from me. \n\nCramming the fridge door shut I turned and walked out of the kitchen. I knew the cleaning job would get worse the longer I left it of course, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. Once I'd nursed my aching tailbone I'd get right on it. I still had three days after all.\n\n***\nIt was the early morning when the noise woke me. The unreality of my dream still clung to me as I surfaced, confused about what had disturbed me. The fan from my PC hummed gently to itself, but there was another sound hiding behind it as if hoping to sneak past unnoticed. I closed my eyes, hoping that whatever it was would sort itself out and I could go back to sleep, but then I heard it again. Something moving downstairs.\n\nMuch more awake at that. Realising how alone I was, I climbed out of bed and padded towards the stairs listening as hard as I could, missing Rachel's comforting presence and feeling exposed and foolish. The sound came again, the soft noise of something small shifting about. My mind moved from intruders to rats, and I let out a hiss through clenched teeth. If we have rats then it'll be Rachel's last staw. There was no choice, I had to go and see. Blearily I shuffled down to the living room and began shining my phone light around the place searching for any hint of rat activity, whatever that would look like. The coffee table knick-knacks were undistubed, no signs of fur or tiny teeth marks in the furniture, but then the torchlight caught the edge of something shiny.\n\nIt was a trail of slime, about as thick as my thumb, coming from under the armchair over the carpet, and leading to the open kitchen door. Beyond that I could see the sickly yellow light from the open fridge illuminating the countertops, and again came the distressed whine of the motor trying to cool the open machinery. I stopped, taking in the scene. Can rats open fridges?\n\nI bent to examine the slime. It was brown and glistened wetly under the white light of my phone, spread in a thin layer that gave off the smell of rotting plants. It looked cold, though I didn't dare touch it. I followed it across the living room and into the kitchen, where the trail ended at the base of the humming refridgerator. That wasn't what shocked me though, what made me stop to take a breath was that from the innards of the fridge spilled out a knotted red tangle, the wet sprouting roots of the potatoes now dangling out like the gutted intenstines of the appliance. A number of the brown things had rolled out onto the floor, lank roots splayed out like spider's legs.\n\n'Oh fuck that. Fuck that...' I whispered to myself, backing out of the horrific kitchen scene.\n\nWithout looking where I was going though I stepped in the trail of slime on the living room floor, the slick substance cold against my bare skin. I stifled a yell but managed to drop my phone, which bounced off the carpet and landed flash-side down, leaving me with nothing but the ambient light coming from the kitchen to see by. Stunned by my own incompetence and gritting my teeth from the revolting substance on my sole, I sat for a moment, torn between crossing the room in the dark for the lightswitch, or simply fumbling under the chair for my phone. As I stood there stupidly in the pitch black though I heard that sound again. A soft, almost squelchy noise, and realised with horror that it was coming from directly above me.\n\nSlowly I knelt and pawed at the floor for my phone, not moving my gaze away from the patch of darkness above me that had made the noise. I wanted to move, to back away from whatever this thing was., but I found my feet rooted to the spot as if I was under the gaze of some consealed predator that would pounce should I turn and run. I wasn't even considering that it was rats any more, rats don't climb walls. I didn't know what I was afraid of, all I knew was that it was the primal fear fear of something dangerous in the dark. Finally, my fingers found the rubber of my phone case, and I jerked back up, clutching it like a talisman.\n\nFor a moment there was nothing. The room was empty, silent, full of sharp shadows in the unforgiving flash of my phone. Then I pointed it upwards, following the slime trail up the wall, the horror inside me growing as I realised that it tracked across the ceiling until there I saw it. Right above my head and suspended by four girthy red roots, was a baking potato.\n\nIt came to a shivering halt in the white spotlight. Soft brown spots covered its beige surface, the forgotten vegitable half-rotten. Each of its glistening tendrils must have been at least two feet long, and they clung to the popcorn ceiling with hair-like protrusions that burgeoned from their rooty length. For a moment my mind ground uselessly against the sight like a misaligned gears, the absurdity too much to bear. Slowly, the flattest surface of the potato came to rest facing me. I had just a single moment to remember _potatoes grow towards light!_ before the roots detached, one by one, and the monstrous thing fell on me.\n\nImmediately the cold, hard sprouts wound around my face and body. Somewhere between flesh and wood they began immediately to squeeze, the sheer power of them shocking. The potato itself landed directly on my face, hitting my nose like a fist and latching on. Already I was scrabbling, pulling at the stringy roots and shouting inchoherantly. The spout around my neck took advantage of my open mouth and shot the tip of its tentacle in, hairy protrusions searching for my spit and sucking my tongue dry in seconds. Horrified I bit down, and was rewarded by the fibrous thing thrashing as my teeth ground against the tough plant matter.\n\nTwo red roots wound around my wrists, binding them together as I attacked the potato itself. My first thought had been to crush the damn thing, but beyond sinking a finger an inch into a mushy spot the rest held firm. I'd forgotten how hard a raw potato was, and now I was losing a fight to one. Desperately I lurched to the kitchen, slipping my way across the slimy linoleum towards the kitchen knives. A second set of roots wound around my ankle as I went, painfully tight, and the weight of another potato bounced against my foot as I grabbed for the largest plastic handle in the block. The potato on my face was choking me with its thin red tendrils, and so unable to attack it properly I engaged in an exaggerated two-handed shaving-motion, swiping the blade parallel to my cheeks to avoid stabbing myself and doing the demon tuber's work for them. The cheap blade barely bit, the dull metal finding its match in the thick potato skin and only cutting off thin chips intead of the butchery I needed.\n\nScuttling sounds from all around now, shadows moving within shadows from every wall and surface in the kitchen. There must have been half a dozen, all alerted by the moisture of my body and ready to attack. I suddenly felt a third vegitable land hard against my back, its ropey sprouts looping around my throat and instantly beginning to crush. The one around my ankle managed to lash my other leg, binding them together and sending me crashing to my kitchen floor. Mercifully I didn't fall on the knife, but the impact knocked it from my hands and sent it spinning out of reach. It had only been a few moments, but already my vision was darkening around the edges as I thrashed on the floor, managing nothing more helpful than kicking the sink cabinet off its hinges.\n\n_I'm going to die. Murdered by posessed potatoes that tied me up on my own kitchen floor..._\n\nThey were closing in then, the unearly sound of potatoes coming in for the kill the last thing I would ever hear. The room was full of squirming red ropes. My thoughts become less coherant as my brain ran out of oxygen, and as my kicking became more feeble my heel caught something that spun up my body and landed behind my neck. A cool, trickling sensation spread across my bare skin.\n_Goopy_  Was the last thing my mind offered me as I slipped beneath the darkness...\n\nAll at once consciousness came rushing back. I sat up, cough-screaming as the tendrils around my neck suddenly released. My hands were still bound near my face and the second potato had my ankles in an iron grip, but the one that had been strangling me was thrashing wildly in a small puddle of blue goo like a demented spider. Its tendrils whipped wildly around before the potato finally shuddered and fell still.\n\nBlinking stars from my eyes I tried to take in what had happened. Something had gotten onto the demonic thing, something that had finally killed it. Then the smell hit me. Bleach! It was bleach, the bottle that I'd lost the cap to months ago! Looking around wildly I found the bottle lying on its side and dove for it just as a large jacket potato pounced on my chest.My hand clasped the bottle as I landed, the dreaded thing squirming beneath me. Two more impacts on my back, but I focused on jamming the nozzle under my chest and blasting the blue gel onto the wretched potato. With a shudder it fell still, though slick roots were now winding around my chest and arms from behind. I gripped the bottle of bleach and let out a defiant scream, spraying a blue stream blindly over my left shoulder until I felt the grip slacken.\n\nTwo more scuttling towards me. My hand was slipping aginst the floor, skidding out from under me as I tried to rise, leaving me staring up at the potatoes that were bearing down on me like giant spasmodic insects. I managed to bring the bottle up and hit the first with a jet, sending it tumbling fowards with its flaccid roots across my neck. The second was on me though, binding my wrist and squeezing so hard I swore it was going to snap. I just barely got the nozzle against the thing and squeezed. With the sound of a wet fart the bottle blasted the last of its bleach into the beige monster, and it fell still. \n\nSilence and stillness. My nose and skin burned with the chemicals, and I slowly pulled myself to my knees. A pale root slid limly from my shoulder and plopped onto the floor. I took a deep, shuddering breath. \n\nWithin a heartbeat I felt tendrils wrap around my head, the potato against my mouth, quivering hairs reaching for the moisture in my eye. With a yell I did the only thing I could think of and wrapped my bleach-covered hands around the wretched thing to pull. It shuddered and squirmed beneath my slimy grip. For a moment it seemed that it would get me, I could feel something wriggling under my eyelid, when all at once the potato skin gave way. I crushed it , mash spewing out between my fingers as I let out a roar of triumph! At last, the whole lot of them were dead.\n\nAfter I'd collected myself I stood and shut the fridge door, finally giving the straining motor some rest. Switichg on the main light I surveyed the carnage. Brown slime and blue bleach covered every surface, and even some bright  spots of my blood. Half-mangled potatoes lay everywhere, their limp red roots trailing like the hair of murder victims on the wet linoleum. I let out a sob, not sure what else to do, and following my instincts went to turn and go to bed, hoping to forget this whole thing.\nSomething stopped me though. Whether it was guilt or simple self-preservation I found myself stopping and turning on the kitchen light. In a daze I went to the sink and wiped the worst of the bleach off me before grabbing cloths and a bin bag and beginning to clean. All the dead potatoes were cleared away, the surfaces wiped, the floor made spotless. I even sorted the fridge, wiping out the last of the slime left by the veggie hoard. By the time I finished the sky outside was being bruised by the first hint of Sunlight, but as I stood at looked at the spotless kitchen I felt a real sense of pride.\n\n'Shower.' I muttered to mysefl. 'Shower, then sleep...'\n\nThe thought of calling the police trundled through my mind as I climbed upstairs, but I dismissed it. What would I even say? Instead I pulled out my phone to message Rachel. She'd be in her hotel by now, and even if she didn't believe me she'd find it funny and be happy the kitchen was clean. Opening the app and was surprised to see a message waiting for me already, and smiled as I opened it. What I read though made my blood turn cold.\n\n_'Hi babe, arrived safe. Hope the cleaning is going well! Not happy with you though, I just got to the hotel and found a mouldy old potato in my lunch bag! I still love you but we're having words when I get back x'_\n\nWith shaking fingers I dialled her number, memories of a slimy beige object in the open zip of her bag materialising in my mind. The phone rang, and rang, and rang."},"198":{"title":"The elevator opened.

Beach, bikini. Real hot. Heavy filters. Nice ass. Then the elevator *ding’d*, door slid open—scraping against the metal frame—and I walked in thinking it was empty (because it looked empty from the lobby) *but it wasn't fucking empty* and my heart dropped, and I gave birth to a stillborn scream that died somewhere in my dry, silenced throat, *because there was a girl in the elevator*—in the corner of the elevator, by the control panel—small girl, thin and angular, her eyes staring at me like a pair of fish-bowls with black floating irises. *Hypnotic.*\n\nI fell back against the elevator wall.\n\nShe opened her mouth, wide—*unnaturally wide*—wide enough to swallow my entire head, and as the elevator door began to close I lunged the fuck out of there.\n\nI ran from the elevator to the lobby doors. Straight into a food delivery guy from SnapMunch trying to come in at the same time I was going out.\n\n“Dude!”\n\nSorry. Sorry.\n\nHe waved his hand at me and walked up to the elevator.\n\n“Don't,” I said. “Take the stairs,” I said. I should have been gone, long gone. But he hadn't pressed the button yet. His outstretched arm—outstretched finger. Why even care? It was none of my business.\n\n“Why?” he asked, annoyed.\n\n“Because… [she's] in there,” I said, unable to describe her except with a mouthful of swollen quiet, like a rest in a piece of music—through which the evil conjured by the notes slips in.\n\nI heard him mutter *weirdo* under his breath.\n\nHe pressed the button.\n\nThe door opened.\n\nDon't.\n\nHe did, and the door slid shut, and he screamed, and his screams disappeared up the elevator shaft, and there was a sound as if someone had jumped from the top of the Empire State Building and landed in a swimming pool filled with jelly; and the elevator stopped at the sixth floor.\n\nHe could have taken the stairs.\n\nHe could have.\n\nAnd then I was taking the stairs—to the sixth floor *because I had to see.* My Heart: *pu-pu-pumping* as out-of-breath I pushed open the door and spilled into the hall. The calm, peaceful hall. Families lived here, I told myself. *Innocence.*\n\nBut the elevator was still here. The door was closed, but it was here. The button called to me, begging me to press it: assure myself that it was all a hallucination. A metaphysical misunderstanding. That there was no girl inside.\n\nI pushed the button.\n\nThe door—\n\nAnd, *oh my God, her face was a sleeve, a flesh-fucking-trumpet,* and she was sucking the delivery guy's head, *slurping* and *humming,* her soft, vibrating ends caressing his neck, and his body, cornered and limp.\n\nThe door slid shut again.\n\n*Stillness.*\n\nI felt like knocking on a door—*any* door—or calling the police (“Are ya off your meds, bud?” “Meds? I don't take any meds.” “There's the trouble. Maybe you should:” end of conversation,) but instead I just stood there, frozen, sweating, trying to remember box breathing and focus and the door opened **and the motherfucking delivery guy walked out.**\n\n*What was I to make of that, huh?*\n\nWalked out and walked by me like I was nothing, like he'd never even seen me before, carrying his paper bag of fast food, which he put down by a door, photographed with his phone, then knocked on the door, turned and walked back to the elevator.\n\nPressed the button.\n\nGot in.\n\n“You coming in?” he asked me in a voice different than before. Monotonous, drained. I saw then his hair was wet with slime.\n\n“No, no,” I choked out. “God, no.”\n\n“OK.”\n\nThe elevator descended.\n\nA unit door opened and a middle-aged woman leaned out to pick up the fast food. “Thanks,” she said, mistaking me for the delivery guy. “You're welcome,” I responded.\n\nI fled into the stairwell and walked up to the twelfth floor where my friend lived, holding the rail to keep my balance and my sanity.\n\n“Whoa,” my friend said when she saw me.\n\nI went inside.\n\n“In the lobby—the elevator—there was a little girl—she was—”\n\n“Elevator Sally,” my friend said.\n\nShe said it just like that. Matter-of-factly. Not a single muscle twitching. “She wouldn't have hurt you,” my friend continued, bringing me a glass of water I'd asked for. “I told her you were coming. Sally doesn't touch residents. She leaves guests alone.”\n\n“A SnapMunch guy,” I said.\n\n“Yeah, she feasts on strangers. Eats their souls. Digests their personalities. Consumes their humanity.”\n\n“And everybody *knows* this?”\n\nI couldn't believe what I was hearing. I had wanted my friend to tell me I was crazy. Tired, under a lot of pressure at work. Making shit up. Daydreaming. Nightmaring.\n\n“Of course. Sally's always been here. She's the daughter of the building.” *Daughter of the building?* “Part of its history, its lore. Daddy takes good care of her.”\n\n“And her mother?”\n\n“Dead. Fell down the elevator shaft.”\n\n*Into a pool filled with jelly?*\n\n“Was she human?”\n\n“As human as you and me. You know the story. Fell in love with an older building. Got fucked. Got pregnant. Gave birth to an urban myth.”\n\n“Then fell down the elevator shaft.”\n\n“Mhm.”\n\n“I think I need to go home. I'm not feeling well,” I said.\n\nShe grabbed a coat. “I'll ride down with you.”\n\nI didn't want to *ride* down. I wanted to *walk* down. “Really, no need,” I said. “Don't worry about it.”\n\nWe were in the hall.\n\nShe called the elevator. I heard it start to move.\n\n*Ding!*\n\n—I followed her in, and all through the descent I kept my eyes on the red-light display showing what floor we were on *so that I only saw Sally, standing skinny in the corner, in the peripheral part of my vision.*\n\nWhen we finally got out, I was drenched.\n\n“Maybe visit again on Saturday,” my friend said from inside the elevator. “We could order SnapMunch, watch a movie. I hear *The House That's Always Stood* is a good one.

No sex.* \n\nIt sounded too good to be true, but, as a broke university student, I was willing to take my chances. I swiped right, and Tinder let me know it was a match. His message came seconds later. \n\n**Hey, there sweetheart :)**\n\nI cringed at that word, I hated it, but seven hundred dollars was seven hundred dollars, so I sucked it up and replied. \n\n**Hey ;)** \n\nHis name was Jack, and he told me he owned his own business, although he never specified what kind of business it was. We talked for a while before he asked me for my Venmo to send me the first payment. \n\nAfter a few minutes, I got the notification. I stared at the $700 for at least twenty minutes, expecting to wake up from a dream at any second. But it wasn’t a dream. \n\n**You still there?** \n\nI clicked on the message. \n\n**Yeah. Sorry. If you don’t mind me asking, what are you looking for in return?** \n\nI stared at the chat until he replied. \n\n**I’m just looking for you to do a few favors for me :)**\n\nThat sounded like it was going to be sexual to me. \n\n**Like what?**\n\n**For example, the first thing I need you to do is pick up a delivery for me.** \n\nThat sounded innocent enough, but I was still expecting there to be some kind of twist. Seven-hundred dollars to pick up a package? Come on, even I wasn’t that naive. \n\n**From the post office or something?** \n\n**No.  I’ll send you the address, but I’d rather not do this through Tinder. You got Kik? Or you can give me your number.**\n\nKik? What was this, 2011? I decided to give him my number instead, and he texted me the address immediately, followed by the address to his house, where I would have to drop off the package. \n\n**I’m not home right now, but there’s a key on the bottom of the blue flower pot near the door. Go inside and put the package on the coffee table in the living room. Make sure that you lock the door when you go inside the house, and then lock it again when you leave.** \n\nI grabbed my car keys and wallet and got into my car, putting the address into Google maps. \n\n**Got it! Omw.** \n\nMy phone buzzed as I backed out of my driveway. \n\n**I’m serious. Lock the door BOTH times. Please.** \n\nI thought that was a little excessive, but I promised him that I would. \n\nThe house looked abandoned. It had a broken chain link fence around it, with a small door that was hanging onto dear life. It stuck out like a sore thumb, surrounded by houses that were a lot nicer than this one in comparison. \n\n“You here for Jack’s shit?”\n\nI looked up to see a man standing in the open doorway of the house. He took up almost the entire space, his head skimming the top of the door frame. He was huge; in height and muscles, and his entire torso was covered in tattoos. \n\n“Uh, yeah. I guess.” I replied, not moving from my spot on the sidewalk. \n\n“Stay right there.” He said. \n\nI did. I actually don’t think I would have moved if he had asked me to. I looked around and realized that there was no one else on this street. I was a twenty-one-year-old woman alone in the street. I gripped my car keys. \n\nA few minutes later, the man came back out carrying a cardboard box. It was about the size of a shoebox, but stained and damp on some of the corners. \n\n“Can you open your car?” He asked. \n\nI opened the trunk, not wanting that inside on my car seats and he set it in. \n\n“Alright, there you go.” He said. \n\n“Thanks.” I replied. \n\nI walked around to the driver's side of the car and opened the door. \n\n“Oh, and one more thing!” He said. \n\nI looked at him. \n\n“Watch out.” He said. \n\nI didn’t reply. \n\nI blasted my music as I drove to Jack’s house, hoping it would drown out my anxiety. It didn’t. \n\nI parked my car in the stone driveway and stayed inside the car, admiring the house. \n\nIt was a *huge* house; with stone pillars on the front porch, and the greenest grass I had ever seen in my life. I turned the car off and got out. I grabbed the package, and walked to the front door, getting the key from where he said it would be. \n\nI opened the door and stepped in, closing it behind me. \n\nI thought about what he had said, about locking the door when I got inside. I thought that was a little overboard, but as I stared at the closed door something made me reach out and lock it. \n\nI walked inside, my feet cushioned by the thick maroon carpet, and admired the inside of the house. All the furniture was wooden and looked incredibly expensive. I would probably finish school a dozen times with the money that it took to furnish this place. \n\nI set the package down on the coffee table, and as I walked back to the door, I heard a phone ringing from somewhere inside the house. I froze. \n\nIn my pocket, my phone buzzed. I took it out to look. \n\n**Don’t answer any calls that aren’t from Marvin.** \n\nI put my phone back and followed the sound of the phone, poking my head into a few different rooms before I found it in an office. \n\nI walked over to the desk and looked at the caller ID. \n\n*Incoming call from Jack.* \n\nThat was odd. \n\nI grabbed my phone to look at the message again. I was starting to get a little bit creeped out and decided I wouldn’t answer, just to be safe, and left the house, remembering to lock the door as I left. \n\nI’ve done a few more favors for Jack since then. I drove a BMW to a random park in another city, only to get out and drive a different car back to Jack’s house. He had me meet one of his “employees” at lunch, who then gave me a briefcase to deliver to the first house I had gone to and told me he would know if I looked inside. On several occasions, he asked me to drive down to that same house and stay with the guy, whose name was Julio, for a certain amount of time.\n\nIn total, I’ve made around $3500. \n\nMost recently, Jack asked me to stay in his house overnight. I woke up to a text message from him. \n\n**I need you to spend the night at my house.** \n\nI hadn’t ever seen him in person, but I had talked to him on the phone a few times. He proceeded to tell me he would pay me $1000 to spend the night at his house, provided that I followed a few rules. \n\nI drove to his house that evening. The driveway was empty, and it normally was, but the porch light was on. I walked up, unlocked the door, went inside and then locked it again. \n\nEverything in the house looked the same. Jack had told me over the phone that he would leave the list of rules on the dining room table. I set all my stuff down in the living room. My bags looked like garbage compared to the fancy furniture in there. \n\nI wandered into the kitchen, and then to the dining room. Sure enough, there was a piece of paper on the wooden table, held down by an empty glass. \n\n*Lock the door when you come in.* \n\n*Only answer calls from Marvin.* \n\n*Don’t turn on any faucets between 9 pm and 11 pm.* \n\n*Don’t open the door for anyone- no matter who they say they are- after 10 pm.* \n\n*If the door to the closet at the end of the hall is open, sleep in the library. If closed, sleep in any of the bedrooms.* \n\n*The gardener comes at midnight. If he starts knocking on the windows, hide.* \n\n*Turn the tv on and let it play on static through the night. DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS.* \n\n*Help yourself to anything in the fridge. :)*\n\n*I’ll pay you in the morning. Goodnight!*\n\nI made sure to follow all the rules. To be honest, I was regretting my decision. But, seeing as I was already here, and I was getting paid, I decided to stay anyway. I figured as long as I followed all the rules, I’d be perfectly fine. \n\nStill, it felt a little odd. What was this? A haunted house?\n\nNevertheless, I lounged around the house for a few hours, as I was planning on going to sleep around nine since that’s the time that all the weird shit would begin to happen. At 8:50, I brushed my teeth, using the faucet for the last time before 9. \n\nI checked the closet in the hallway and upon seeing that it was open, I moved my stuff into the library and got ready to sleep on the couch. I locked to doors just in case, and laid on the couch, scrolling through my phone. I hadn’t gotten any more messages from Jack, and I started to think up scenarios and reasons as to why he had such strict, peculiar sets of rules in his house. \n\nI had dozed off at some point because, at exactly 10:16 pm, I was woken up by the doorbell ringing. I was about to get up to check, but then I remembered the rule. \n\n*Don’t open the door for anyone- no matter who they say they are- after 10 pm.* \n\nI stayed on the couch, trying not to move, paranoid that they would hear even the slightest sound. \n\n“It’s the police! Open up.” \n\nI didn’t move. \n\n“Hello? It’s the police! Open up or we’re coming in.”\n\nI still didn’t move, but I could hear my heartbeat in my ears. \n\nThere was silence for a while after that. \n\nThen the doorbell rang again. \n\n“Hey, it’s Jack! Let me in!”\n\nIt sounded like Jack, but still, I didn’t get up. He would have a key, wouldn’t he? Why would he need me to let him in?\n\nThis continued for almost a full hour; different people would ring the doorbell, announce themselves, and then disappear when I didn’t respond. \n\nI was finally able to fall asleep, and the gardener never came. \n\nWhen I woke up the next morning, I heard someone in the kitchen. I got up slowly, and unlocked the door as quietly as possible, taking my phone with me and walking across the living room and into the kitchen. \n\nI stopped at the entrance and peered in. \n\nIt was Jack. He was standing in front of the stove, stirring something as the coffee machine brewed coffee on the counter behind him. \n\n“Hey! Good morning!” He said when he saw me. \n\n“Hi.” I replied, nervous. \n\nI hadn’t seen him in person before, but he looked exactly like his pictures online. \n\n“Scrambled eggs?” He asked, motioning to the pan with a wooden spoon. \n\n“Yeah, thanks!” I replied, walking over to take the plate from him. \n\nI ate my breakfast and drank some coffee in silence. \n\n“So how was it?” He asked. \n\n“It was okay. Nothing super freaky happened.” I replied. \n\n“Cool!” He replied.\n\nThere was an awkwardness in the room. \n\n“I think I’m gonna go now. I have class…” I trailed off. \n\nI didn't. But I really wanted to get out of there. \n\n“Oh, no! Yeah, sure! I’ll talk to you some other time.” He replied. \n\nI grabbed my stuff and he walked me to my car. I could see him standing in the driveway, staring at me as I left. \n\nWhen I got home, I unpacked all my stuff and noticed that I still had the list with me. I sat on my bed and read it again. I felt my body tense up as I realized that I had forgotten something. \n\n*Turn the tv on and let it play on static through the night. DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS.* \n\n*Turn the tv on and let it play on static through the night. DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS.* \n\n*DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS.* \n\nI stared at the words on the page until they lost meaning. \n\nBeside me, my phone buzzed, snapping me back to reality. \n\nIt was the $1000 payment. \n\nI looked at my phone and then back at the list. \n\nMaybe it wasn’t an important step?\n\nAs I was thinking this over, a text from Jack came it. \n\n**I’m not in town right now, I should be back next week, so you’re free from running any more errands for me until then! Just sent the payment, go do something fun ;)**\n\nI stared at the message and read it again. \n\nAnd again. \n\nAnd once more for good measure. \n\n**I’m not in town right now.** \n\nI thought back to this morning, and how Jack was in his house. How he gave me breakfast. \n\n**I’m not in town right now.** \n\nWithin minutes, a new text came in this time from a number that I didn’t recognize. \n\n**Did you forget to do something? ;)**\n\nThe text was followed by a picture of Jack - or, whoever this version of Jack was- standing in front of the tv. \n\nI didn’t respond. \n\nNext came another picture, this one was of the outside of my house. \n\nIt was followed by another text. \n\n**Watch out.**"},"201":{"title":"My wife has been peeking at me from around corners and behind furniture.

I can't stress enough how out of character this whole thing is for her.  \n\n\n\nLynn is very kind, intelligent and thoughtful. She's always been the no nonsense type of person. Being childish, or trying to scare me is not something she'd normally do. \n\n\n\nShe doesn't even like watching horror movies. When we first started dating she agreed to watch The Shining with me because she knew how much I loved horror. She was so scared that she didn't even make it through half of the movie before we had to turn it off. She isn't into anything creepy, and has never been into pranks. It's just not her cup of tea. And that's fine. But that's what was so strange about this. It's just so unlike her. \n\n\n\n\nI should also add that she never had any mental health issues and as far as I'm aware it doesn't run in her family. I know some people are able to hide their mental health problems, but in the six years we've been together I think I'd have seen some sort of sign. \n\n\n\nTwo months ago, I was in the kitchen making myself some coffee before work. I was running a bit late that morning and knew I wouldn't be able to make it to Dunkin Donuts for my usual morning fix. \n\nI took a sip of my coffee as I hurried down the hall towards the front door, when I happened to notice Lynn peeking at me from around the corner ahead of me. I could only see her eyes, and a  strand of her long dark hair hanging against the wall. The rest of her body was concealed behind the corner. I nearly spilled my coffee when I saw her. I did burn the shit out of my lips. \n\n\n\n\"Geeze, Lynn.\" I said, wiping a few drops of coffee from my pants. \"You scared the shit out of me.\" \n\nShe immediately popped out of view like a little kid that had been caught. I heard her scurry off towards the living room, and by the time I got to the front door she was out of sight. \n\n\n\nIt was really weird, and just totally out of character for her like I said, but I also found it kind of funny that she was being more playful and a little less serious. I shouted that I loved her, and called her a weirdo. As I shut the door behind me I heard her laughing.\n\n\n\nHer behavior was a bit odd, but it certainly wasn't something to call a priest over. I forgot about it by lunch and by the time I got home she was her normal self. I didn't bring it up and neither did she, and life went on. \n\n\n\nThe next incident happened three days later. It was around 2am and I had woken up to get a drink. I was standing at the kitchen island, jug of Oj in hand, when I felt a strong feeling that I was being watched. \n\n\n\nFor whatever reason I looked down at the floor and saw my wife's smiling face staring back. She was peeking at me from the other side of the island, staring up at me with wide unblinking eyes and grinning. Grinning like the Cheshire cat. \n\n\n\n I screamed, I'll admit it. Not out of irritation but fear. For some reason at that moment I was scared. \n\n\nAt the sound of my scream Lynn scuttled backwards out of my view, her hands and feet smacking the tile floor as she hurried out of the kitchen on all fours.  I didn't run after her, or even yell after her. I just stood there frozen in shock, wondering what fuck had possessed her to do that.\n\n\n\n It took me a little longer than I'd like to admit to go back upstairs, but I eventually did. When I got to our bedroom, Lynn was lying on her side, asleep. Or at least pretending to be. I stood there for a while, watching her breathing to be sure she really was asleep. \n\n\nI had the feeling she might jump out at me the moment I got into bed. But she didn't. I climbed into bed and she didn't even move. Her breathing was soft and deep and I was starting to wonder if I'd dreamt the whole thing. \n\n\n\nThe next morning I waited for her to come down for coffee and after handing her a mug and kissing her cheek I decided to ask her about it. \n\n\n\n\"What was that about last night?\" I asked, keeping my tone light so I didn't offend or embarrass her. \n\n\n\nShe frowned over her cup of coffee, shaking her head like she had no clue what I was referring to. \n\n\n\n\"You were peeking at me again. From over there.\" I said, pointing to the spot on the floor by the kitchen island.  \n\n\n\nShe followed my gaze, and when she looked back at me she burst out laughing. She laughed so hard that I couldn't help but join her. \n\n\n\n\"You creep me the fuck out sometimes, you know that?\" I said. She giggled and set her cup on the counter and wrapped her arms around my neck. \n\n\n\n\"You creep me out all the time. So I guess we're even.\" She teased.\n\n\n\nWe said our goodbyes and left for work. As I drove I kept thinking about how creepy it had been seeing her grinning at me from behind the island like that. The sounds her hands made on the floor as she crawled away. I told myself she was just trying to be silly. Just trying to join me in my love of all things horror…. \n\n\n It's not like I was afraid of her. But it still didn't sit right with me. \n\n\nI started seeing her peeking at me more and more. Sometimes she'd be peeking out from behind the couch or living room curtains. Once she even managed to get inside her grandmother's old trunk that sits at the foot of our bed. \n\nI might not have even known she was there at all had the trunk's old hinges not given her away. \n\n\nShe'd had the lid propped up just enough so that  only half of her face peeked through. She'd been grinning like an excited toddler. It was unnerving. I didn't even know what to say to her. All I could do was stare. When I finally found my voice, I asked her why on earth was she doing this. She didn't answer, but she had slowly closed the lid, shutting herself inside the trunk. I just walked away, feeling disturbed.  \n\n\nI didn't understand why she was doing it, but it clearly made her happy. I just hoped she would tire of the game quickly. \n\n\nLynn didn't peek at me for the next two weeks. I started to think she was done with her weird prank and I was relieved. We were watching a show on Netflix one night and I jokingly said that I hadn't seen her peeking at me lately, and that she must have given up on her spy game. She looked up at me with a small smile and said, \"Maybe I've just gotten better at it.\" \n\n\nI didn't say anything but I wondered whether or not she was joking.\n\n\n\nFor the next few days I couldn't stop thinking about what she'd said. Was she still peeking at me when I wasn't looking and I just hadn't noticed? And if so, what the hell was she getting out of this? I started to feel paranoid, constantly checking whether she was watching from around the corner, or behind a door.  I was jumpy whenever I was home and she wasn't in full view of me. I felt stupid and a little crazy. \n\n\nBut after a few weeks without another incident, I began to relax.  I stopped checking behind furniture and walls and told myself it was just a bad memory. \n\n\n\nThen a few days ago things got so much worse....\n\n\nLynn left to go to a friend's, and I lounged on the couch and played a couple games on my laptop. \n\n\nAround 9pm I hopped in the shower and as I was washing the soap from my hair, I felt that awful feeling that I was being watched. I slowly opened my eyes and almost had a fucking heart attack. \n\n\n\nLynn was peeking from behind the shower curtain, her entire head stretched into the shower, leaving just her body outside. Her long dark hair hung against the curtain, the ends dripping with water. Her mouth hung open in a terrible grin, eyes wide and red, as if she hadn't blinked in a while. I screamed and jumped back against the wall. She didn't move nor did her smile waver. Her makeup ran down her cheeks in two black streaks. She looked giddy and completely deranged. I was fucking terrified. \n\n\n \n\nWe stood like that for a few moments, neither of us saying a word. Finally after what felt like forever, she slowly pulled her head back out of the shower, and I watched her blurry figure  through the curtain as she moved backwards towards the bathroom door. \n\n\n\nA second later the bathroom door slammed shut, hard enough to rattle the mirror. I screamed again, and jumped out of the shower to lock the door. I stayed inside the bathroom for over an hour. Maybe I overreacted to some of you. But joke or not, I wasn't going to put up with the crazy shit anymore. That's what I kept telling myself as I paced in my bathroom, stopping to listen at the door every few minutes. \n\n\n\nSuddenly I heard a muffled sound, and I pressed my ear against the bathroom door, straining to listen. I couldn't hear anything but I envisioned Lynn standing on the other side of the door, giggling at her joke. \n\n\nI felt a surge of anger. I was beyond pissed at being made to feel scared in my own house, and made to hide in the bathroom for an hour. All for what? Some joke? If it was a joke it was an awful one. \n\n\n\n\"What the fuck Lynn!\" I snapped. \"This shit is getting really fucking annoying.\" I waited for her to apologize, or to call me a jerk. But instead I heard a faint moan, so quiet I wondered if I heard it at all, and then complete silence. \n\n\n\n\"Lynn?\" I called out, not able to even hide the shakiness in my voice. I got no response. Just my own heavy breathing. \n\n\n\n\"I swear to God, just fucking stop it!\" I yelled, pounding my fist on the door. \n\n\nI waited for her to cuss me out, something I would expect from me talking to her like that. I never screamed at her before. \n\n\nBut there was nothing. Just the occasional drip from the shower head. \n\n\n\n\nI won't deny that I was scared. Too afraid to open the damn door and face my own wife. I waited another 30 minutes or so, which feels like a fucking lifetime when you're scared. Finally I decided I wasn't going to spend the night hiding in my bathroom, so I got down on my knees and peered under the door. I almost expected to see her face peeking back at me but thankfully I didn't. I could see straight down the hallway to the top of the stairs, but no Lynn. I didn't know if I should be happy about that or not. I looked for a few minutes, waiting to see her head pop up over the top step, but it never came. \n\n\n\nI stood up, my hand hovering over the door and mentally prepared myself to open it. I slowly turned the lock with shaky fingers, and was about to yank it open when I heard a sound that still makes me feel nauseous when I think about it. \n\n\n\nA moan, louder than before, but this time I was able to tell just where it was coming from. I turned my head to the closet door as if in slow motion, and locked eyes with my wife who was peeking out at me from the slight gap.  \n\n\n\nHer eyes were still wide as ever and her mouth was hanging open in the most grotesque gaping smile I'd ever seen. I didn't even scream. I was too scared for even that. Her hands were clasped to her chest, body trembling with sheer delight, as if she could barely contain her excitement. A short raspy moan bubbled up from her throat, deep and raw, sending a shiver through my entire body. \n\n\n\nSomehow I found the ability to pull the bathroom door open and ran as fast as I could all the way down the steps, snagging my keys and phone from the table in the living room before running outside to my car. I could hear her shrill laughter behind me but I didn't hear her getting closer. I didn't bother shutting the front door. I drove away from the house faster than I legally should have, shivering the entire time, either from fear or the cold. Maybe a little of both. I hadn't grabbed a coat or even a pair of shoes. I was still in my boxers and my hair was still damp. \n\n\n\nI drove straight to my brother Chris's house about 40 minutes away, ignoring any and every call and text I got. I didn't check my phone until I was safely parked in my brother's driveway. Lynn had called 4 times and sent a flurry of texts, all wondering where I'd gone and why I left \"like that.\" \n\n\n\n\nI threw my phone at the dash in a rage, furious at her nonchalant attitude. My brother and his wife were surprised to see me, especially dressed in just a pair of boxers, but told me to stay as long as I needed. Chris lent me some clothes and asked me what happened. I told him Lynn and I had a fight, but didn't get into the details. I didn't want him to think I was overreacting, leaving my wife over a prank, even if it was a strange one. I mean, hadn't I encouraged her for years to lighten up instead of being so serious all the time? I had wanted her to relax and loosen up, but this was definitely not what I'd had in mind.  \n\n\n \n\n\nI tried to sleep on their sofa, but my brain wouldn't let me sleep. Every time I closed my eyes I saw Lynn's face staring at me from inside the closet. Knowing she'd been in there with me the entire time made my skin crawl. She'd never left the fucking bathroom at all. Instead she slipped inside the closet and slammed the bathroom door shut to fool me. \n\n\n\nThe mere thought of going back home gave me anxiety. I tossed and turned, unable to sleep. Chris ended up giving me a sleeping pill so I was able to get a little rest. My sleep was filled with terrible dreams. All of Lynn's smiling face. \n\n\n\nI woke up just as the sun started to rise. My sore body ached from the sofa, and I felt drained. I knew I'd have to call Lynn at some point, but I didn't know what to say to her. I wouldn't be going home unless she gave me her word she'd never do anymore creepy shit. \n\n\nI just wanted my wife back. Her normal serious self never looked so good to me. \n\n\n\nI was contemplating calling her and telling her that, when that familiar feeling came over me. I was being watched. I was staring at the ceiling, my heart in my throat. I didn't want to look away but the longer I ignored the feeling the worse it got. \n\n\n\nMy eyes drifted away from the ceiling almost on their own. Her face was pressed up against the window beside the couch, staring down at me with that same gaping smile. Drool dribbled down her lips, leaving two long streaks down the glass. I didn't know how long she'd been there, but something told me she'd been there quite a while, possibly all night. \n\n\n\nI didn't bother screaming, though I was afraid anger trumped any fear I felt at that moment. I jumped up from the couch and pounded my palm against the glass. \n\n\"Lynn! Are you crazy? What the hell is wrong with you? Just go home!\" I shouted. \"Now!\" \n\nShe didn't move, and her ghastly expression never changed. If anything her smile only grew, as if she had never been more elated. \n\n\n\nI could hear Chris and his wife moving around upstairs. As if Lynn could hear them from her place outside, her head twitched slightly in their direction, and she began to close her mouth slowly. \n\n\nChris called my name from upstairs, obviously concerned. I turned to see him and his wife Rebecca hurrying down the steps. When I turned back to the window Lynn was gone. The only sign she'd been there at all was the two streaks of drool still dripping down the glass. \n\n\n\nI tried explaining to Chris and Rebecca about waking up to see Lynn watching me through their window. They were skeptical, who wouldn't be? Chris and I went outside to the spot in front of the window but there were no footprints in the dirt, just a slight indent. Animal probably, Chris guessed, and I didn't argue. He and Rebecca assumed I dreamt the entire episode but they didn't understand, and I was too tired to explain it to them.  \n\n\n\n\nI called out of work that day and turned my cell off. I didn't want to face Lynn. Just talking to her was too much for me at that point. I really started to believe something was irreversibly wrong with her. That no matter what promises she made we'd never be the same again. The thought saddened me to my core. I cried most of the morning. By noon I figured I was ready to confront her. Give her one last chance to explain herself. I could at least give her that after 6 years I told myself. I turned my phone on and saw the dozens of texts she'd sent, all from a seemingly concerned wife. \n\n\n\n\"Can we talk?\"\n\n\n\n\"I love you.\"\n\n\n\n\"Please call me.\" \n\n\n\n\"I'm really worried.\"\n\n\n\n\"Can you answer?\" \n\n\n\n\"Just come home.\"\n\n\n\n\nAnd more of the same. All texts telling me she loved me, and she wanted me home. How worried she was….Not a damn one addressing the crazy shit she pulled. Like she hadn't been acting like a character from a Stephen King book. \n\n\nEven her texts were different. She normally texted novels just to tell me to pick up a loaf of bread! You'd think she'd have more to say to me after her bizarre shenanigans. \n\n\n\n\nI know it probably seems childish to some of you who are miles away from this situation. But if you saw the way Lynn had looked at me, how she scampered away on all fours like some wild animal, grinning at me from inside the closet like a lunatic…..then I think you'd find my reaction was warranted. \n\n\n\nI ended up staying with Chris and Rebecca for another night. I didn't wake up yesterday until after noon, and thankfully I didn't see Lynn's face watching me through the window. \n\n\n\n\"I don't want to pry, because it's not my place. But is this fight something that can be mended?\" Rebecca asked. She'd made us both a sandwich for lunch and I knew she wanted to breach the subject without seeming to be nosy. \n\n\n\n\"I don't know. I just….. She's like a different person.\" I said, choosing my words carefully. I still wasn't ready for her or Chris to know the full extent of the bat shit craziness I had been dealing with.\n\n\n\n\"People change Ben. But she's still the same woman you married. Maybe you both just need to talk through your issues. Whatever's going on, I'm sure it can be fixed.\" She said, ever the peacemaker. \n\n\n\n\"I think it's beyond that now. I don't think talking would help. I just don't trust her.\" I said. The words stung in my heart. I missed and loved my wife. But how could I live with someone like that? Living in constant fear didn't sound too appealing. \n\n\n\n\"Lynn loves you. She has to be absolutely crushed.\" She said.  \n\n\n\n\"I don't know about that.\" I said. \n\n\n\n\"Well she certainly seemed like it to me. I've never seen her so upset. Very much unlike the Lynn I know.\" Rebecca said, shaking her head sadly. \n\n\n\nIt took a full minute for her words to really sink in and when they did, I felt dread worming its way through my skin. \n\n\n\n\"Wait. What do you mean? You saw her? You saw Lynn?\" I asked, my mouth suddenly dry. \n\n\n\nRebecca nodded casually as if that fact wasn't nightmare fuel. Maybe for her it wasn't. \n\n\n\n\"She stopped by this morning just after Chris left for work.\"  She said, cleaning the plates from the table. \"I didn't see her car though. Maybe she took an uber or something.\" \n\n\n\n\"Becc. What did she say? Did..did she come inside?\" I asked, sweat starting to break out on my forehead. I began looking around, examining corners as though a predator lurked behind them. \n\n\n\n\"No. She just asked if you were awake yet and I said that you weren't. I asked if she wanted me to wake you but she said no. Just said to let you sleep.\" She said as she washed the dishes. \n\n\n\n\"That's all? She didn't say anything else?\" I asked. \n\n\n\n\"No. She looked awful though. Like she hadn't slept in days. I think you should call her.\"\n\n\n\nI got up from the table and thanked Rebecca for lunch. \n\n\nI felt a little bit better at the knowledge that at least she hadn't come inside. Still, I needed to double check that the doors were locked. \n\n\n\n\nI sat for a while trying to figure out what to do next. I didn't want to go home, but I felt that I owed it to Lynn to help her if I could. Hadn't I swore an oath to love and honor her through sickness and in health? Clearly she was very sick. \n\n\n\n\nIf she was sick, which I truly believed she was, I had to try and get her the help she needed. But I didn't even know where to start. I didn't want to call the police, and besides, what the hell was I going to tell them? That my wife was peeking at me? That she was being creepy? As bizarre as she'd been, she still hadn't committed any crime. Not yet anyway. The police would have probably said that I was overreacting. But this wasn't some prank. It felt wrong. Dangerous even. Like something sinister lurked beneath her smile.\n\n\n\nI knew as her husband I was well within my rights to have her committed, but what if she simply acted normal in their presence? She'd obviously been able to fool Rebecca into thinking she was just a concerned wife. As long as the doctors didn't find her a danger to herself or others, they'd have no choice but to release her after 72 hours. I felt lost and overwhelmed. \n\n\n\nSo I did what any husband in my position would do.\n\n\nI called her mother.\n\n\nI didn't want to, believe me. \n\nHer mother, Marianne and I were never on the best of terms. We'd never fought or anything like that. \n\nShe just wasn't a very warm person, and wasn't really easy to get along with.  She hardly ever smiled and when she did, only her lips would move into a thin lipped smile, leaving her eyes as blank as before. She gave off this aura that felt like she was permanently on the offensive. \n\n\n\nI'd only met her twice and both times were for such short visits. I got the impression she didn't approve of me for her daughter. Lynn always ushered us out quickly, as she didn't want me to feel uncomfortable which I was grateful for. Being in her mother's company felt almost unbearable. Like walking on glass. I was glad when we moved three states away so we didn't have to see her often. I was happy to avoid the woman, but I needed her help.  \n\n\n\nI really didn't want to talk to her at all but I had to talk to someone and someone who knew Lynn better than I did. So I grit my teeth and did what I had to. \n\n\n\n\"Yes?\" She answered, already sounding irritated. \n\n\n\n\"Marianne, it's me Ben. Do you have a minute to talk?\" I asked. I could hear her cluck her tongue in irritation. \n\n\n\n\"I'm in the middle of writing some checks, but if you insist, I suppose I can spare a moment. What is it that you want to discuss Benjamin?\"  She said, coolly? \n\n\n\n\"It's about Lynn. She's been... acting strangely and I was wondering if you had any idea whether there was something - \" I was quickly interrupted. \n\n\n\n\"It's a bit difficult to follow your rambling Benjamin, what is that you want from me?\" She asked. I could almost see her standing there in her thin sweater and slacks, tapping her fingernails impatiently on the table. \n\n\n\n\"I wanted to know if you'd ever noticed any odd behavior? Or possibly any mental health issues?\" I asked. There was a long, uncomfortable pause  that I couldn't tell was because she was just thinking, or ….something else. Finally after a few seconds she spoke. \n\n\n\n\"I'm not sure if this is one of your jokes Benjamin, but if so I don't find the humor in it. Now I do have business to attend to as I've said,  so if you don't mind -\" she said, but I cut her off before she could get rid of me. \n\n\n\n\"Marianne, it's not a joke. I'm sincerely concerned about Lynn's mental health. Her behavior has been very erratic lately. I'm very worried about her and I figured as her mother you would be as well.\" I said, my frustration evident in my voice. \n\n\n\n\"If you're truly concerned then I suggest you get the health professionals involved. I don't know what you expect of me.\" She snapped. I could tell she was seconds away from hanging up and for some reason I was desperate not to let her. I had the feeling that she knew a lot more than she was letting on. \n\n\n\n\"Please. If not for me, do it for Lynn.\" I tried. \n\n\n\nI heard a faint shaky intake of breath, as if she were trying to hold her steely persona together but failing. \n\n\n\n\"Marianne? What's wr-\"  I started. \n\n\n\n\"Benjamin, I don't know what to tell you. My only advice would be to seek professional help. Do not call here again. Goodbye.\" I tried to call out to her but she'd hung up. \n\n\n\nI tried to wrap my head around the call and her refusal to help me. Even if she didn't like me, why wouldn't she want to help her own daughter? I couldn't understand that. I tried to replay the conversation, desperate to find something I missed.\n\n\n After a while I almost gave up, until I remembered her last last words to me. 'Seek professional help' she'd said those words with a bit of urgency. I could have just been grasping at straws but no, I was sure her voice had changed ever so slightly when she'd said that. As if they were very important.\n\n\n\n\nWhat had she meant? I assumed she'd been referring to medical professionals, but maybe she was referring to someone else. Someone that she didn't, for some reason, feel comfortable saying directly. Or maybe I was just desperate. \n\n\n\nI waited for Chris to get home and after a very long and exhausting conversation with him and Rebecca, I convinced them that Lynn truly needed psychiatric help. I didn't tell them everything. I wasn't prepared to go into it yet, but I told them about our last encounter. How she'd hidden in the bathroom, peeking at me from the closet. \n\n\nThey were obviously shocked but thankfully they believed me. They too just wanted to help her. Still they didn't think it was all that serious. Weird, maybe but not dangerous. They just kept saying that Lynn had to be playing some kind of weird joke. \"Maybe for YouTube?\" Rebecca offered, if only half-heartedly. \n\n\n\nChris didn't think we should involve the police just yet. He offered instead to go with me, and I readily accepted. He reasoned that calmly talking to her, trying to coax her into going willingly was the best recourse. I agreed to do it his way. At least I wouldn't be going into that house alone. \n\n\n\nWe drove over this morning, just after breakfast. There was no way I was going at night. When we pulled into the driveway my stomach began doing somersaults. Her car wasn't there, but I still didn't let my guard down. \n\n\n\nThe front door was ajar, and for a split second I thought we'd see her eyes staring through the gap. I was shaking and starting to sweat. Chris however was fine. He waited for me to open the door, his hands in his pockets like he was going on a fucking stroll through the park. I envied his ignorance.\n\n\n\nI pushed the door open and was immediately hit with the stench of rot. Chris smelled it too, and he walked in the house behind me with his nose scrunched up. \n\n\n\"What do you guys use to clean the floors around here, shit?\" Chris mumbled. \n\n\n\"Shut up.\" I said, my eyes darting around for any signs of Lynn.\n\n\n\nThe house was deadly quiet and dark despite being 10 in the morning. All the curtains were closed up tight, refusing to allow any sunlight inside. If I hadn't left it just two days prior I'd have thought the house to be abandoned. \n\n\nWe moved through each room, carefully checking any place that she might hide, occasionally calling her name. \n\n\n\n\"Why the fuck are you looking under the couch?\" Chris asked eventually. \"Aren't we looking for your wife?\"  He was looking at me like I was a moron. \n\n\n\n\"Let's just go upstairs.\" I whispered. He shook his head but followed me up the stairs to check the bathroom and spare bedroom. On the way up my shoes crunched over pieces of glass that looked to be littered over a few of the steps. \n\n\n\nI noticed that one of Lynn and my wedding portraits that hung on the wall along the staircase had been smashed. The frame hung crookedly, all the glass removed. I stared at the picture, a lump forming in my throat. We had taken the photo just after leaving the church, after saying our vows. She looked so beautiful in her white gown. I looked at Lynn's beautiful face. I never dreamed her face would ever be a source of terror for me.  \n\n\n\nWe climbed the rest of the steps and checked the spare bedroom, but it looked completely untouched. \n\n\nI was hesitant to go into the bathroom, my fear from that night coming back to me all at once. Chris noticed, and offered to go in by himself but I couldn't let him do that. So we walked in together, checking the closet and the shower. The bathroom looked as if it hadn't been touched since the night I left. \n\n\n\n\"I don't think she's here Ben. Why don't you pack some clothes and we'll try coming back tomorrow or something.\" Chris said. I nodded and went into our bedroom and shoved some clothes into a duffle bag. When I checked inside our closet I came across the source of the smell and gagged. \n\n\nChris took one look and lost all color in his face. He had to go stand by the stairs to get away from the sight and smell. \n\n\n\n I gazed down in shock at what lay Inside my bedroom closet. Soaking into the rug, were at least a dozen eyeballs, all carefully laid out in pairs. Some were as large as a quarter while others were as tiny as a marble. I stared down at the eyes she'd collected from small animals and I wondered how she'd gotten them, and shuddered at the thought. \n\n\n\"Man, I thought I had it bad with Becca's shoe addiction. But fuck me. Your wife's in here collecting eyeballs.\" Chris said, gagging.  \"Ben, I think we should go.\"  He called from the hall. \"I'm getting nauseous.\"\n\n\n\n\"Alright.\" I grabbed my duffle and shut the closet door on my new nightmare. I stepped out into the hall and took a deep breath of air. I could taste the rot on my tongue and I couldn't help but gag. \n\n\n\n\"Who the fuck lines up eyeballs in their closet like that?\"  Chris mumbled. \n\n\n\"I tried to tell you she needed help.\" I said. \n\n\n\n\"She doesn't need help, Ben. She needs a fucking exorcist.\" He said. \"You coming or what? I can't stand the smell any- \" his words died in his throat, and his eyes grew wide with fear. \n\n\n\nI didn't ask him why. I could feel it. Someone was watching me and I didn't think it was the eyes in the closet.  I turned around, my eyes slowly scanning the bedroom. \n\n\n\n\"Christ\" I whispered, as I finally saw what we'd missed. Under the bed, curled on her side, watching us with the excitement of a kid on Christmas morning, was my wife. \n\n\nShe held her hands together just under her chin, and they were shaking eagerly.  \n\n\n\nNow that she knew she'd been found, I could hear the quiet noises she was making. A sort of hiccuping sound in her throat, as if the excitement was just too much for her. It was unnerving to say the least. Wide eyes, and that same huge smile. \n\n\n\nEverything in me told me to run, but I forced it away. This was my wife. No matter how twisted, she was still the woman I married. I had to help her. \n\n\n\n\"Lynn…\"  I said softly. She didn't respond, but her head bobbed back and forth in two quick little movements as if she were nodding. \n\n\n\n\"Baby. I just wanna help okay? Can you…. Can you let me do that?\" I asked. I had taken a single step forward, approaching her like some kind of dangerous animal. \n\n\n\n\"I love you, Lynn.\" I said softly, taking another step closer. She let a tiny moan escape her wide open mouth and I had to resist the urge to run.  Her shoulders were starting to quiver, and her eyes grew as large as saucers. \n\n\n\nI crouched down so I could see her better, and immediately saw the blood. Her hands were covered in it. They trembled more the closer I got, as if she was barely able to contain herself. \n\n\n\n\"Lynn. Are you hurt? You're bleeding.\" I said. She bobbed her head again, her bloody fingers moving up and down as if playing an invisible piano. They occasionally grazed her chin, leaving smears of blood on her skin. \n\n\n\nI wanted to recoil in disgust. The smell that was coming off of her was revolting. I could feel the vomit trying to climb up my throat. \nHer lips were dry and stretched thin, blood seeping between the cracks. \n\n\nI knew she wouldn't come out on her own, but I didn't want to leave her in the state she was in. \n\n\nI scooted closer and reached out to her. The excited hiccuping sounds got louder and her hands shook, fingers flexing. It was then that I could see the blood oozing from in between her fingers. \n\n\n\n\"Oh my God, Lynn. You're bleeding.\" I said. Instinctively I reached out to take her hand, but before I could even touch her, her hand sprang out towards me. A sharp pain shot through my arm, and I fell back on my ass. My arm burned, and I could see the blood dripping down onto the carpet. \n\n\nI looked back at her in shock and saw her grinning madly, her fingers clutching a large shard of glass. \n\n\n\n\"You alright in there?\" Chris asked from behind me. \n\n\n\nI turned my head slightly, and nodded to him, cradling my arm to my chest. When I turned back to face Lynn, I saw that her focus had shifted. She wasn't looking at me anymore. And she wasn't smiling anymore either. \n\n\n\nShe was staring past me, her eyes glaring at Chris the way a hungry lion might stare at an antelope. Her mouth was still hanging open but it was twisted into a snarl.\n\n\nI got to my feet, and began walking backwards down the hall, afraid to take my eyes off her. \n\n\n\n\"Are you... bleeding?\" Chris asked. The moment the words left his mouth Lynn started fast scooting out from under the bed, the glass shard still in her fist. \n\n\n\n\"Chris. Run. Go!\" I yelled. He must have been too afraid to move because a second later I felt my back bump into him. He was still standing at the top of the stairs, staring at the horror that was my wife. \n\n\n\nLynn had crawled completely out from under the bed and stood in the bedroom doorway, her face twisted in rage. Her whole body was visibly tense. Blood ran down her fingers and onto the floor. \n\n\n\n\"Jesus, Lynn...\" Chris said, \"You uh… playing hide and seek?\" I reached back and pushed him towards the steps. \n\n\n\n\"Move your ass Chris\" I said as quietly but firmly as I could. \n\n\n\nLynn bobbed her head in fast, sharp motions, and began to grin, stretching her mouth open wider and wider so that her chin seemed to touch her chest. I heard Chris mutter a prayer and then he was running down the stairs. I stood at the top of the steps, stuck between the love for a woman who clearly needed serious help, and self preservation. \n\n\n\n\n\"I only want to help.\" I said, choking back tears. Her eyes focused on me once again as she slowly lifted the glass, holding it out in front of her. And then she started sprinting towards me, grinning with utter excitement. Thankfully my body took over and I flew down the stairs skipping two or three at a time. I made it to the front door before I felt her leap onto my back, wrapping her arms around my neck, her open mouth next to my ear so that I could hear those terrible hiccuping sounds up close. I shook her off me, knocking her to the floor. I felt a searing pain in my back as she went but I tore open the front door and bolted to my car. \n\n\n\nChris was standing in the front yard, talking on the phone with the police. I didn't say a word, I just ran to my car and jumped in. Chris took the hint and followed me, still on the line with 911\n\n\n\nI watched the rear view mirror, sure I'd see her there, running after us. But I never did. \n\n\n\nI went straight to the ER and got 11 stitches in my arm and 3 on my back. The police asked a lot of questions and went back to the house to do a search but of course, Lynn wasn't there. \n\n\nThey advised me to stay with a friend or relative for a while and to file a restraining order as soon as I could but none of those things would matter. Somehow I just knew. \n\n\n\nI dropped Chris off at home, and went to a motel an hour away. I wanted to put as much distance between me and Lynn as I could. \n\n\n\nThis is where I've been for the last 4 hours. I thought maybe the police would find her, maybe they'd get her the help she desperately needs. \n\n\nBut now I don't think so. Because 40 minutes ago I got a text from an unknown number. Just three words :\n\n\n\n\"I found You.\" \n\n\n\nAnd a picture attached. The picture was dark and grainy, but I instantly knew what it was. There was no mistaking my wife's eye. \n\n\n\nI started typing this out immediately after. I don't know what to do. I'm alone and scared, and I can't help but feel that I'm being watched…."},"202":{"title":"Something walks whistling past my house every night at 3:03.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/dyqd5e\/something_walks_whistling_past_my_house_every\/","flair":null,"author":"Grand_Theft_Motto","selftext":"Every night, no matter the weather, something walks down our street whistling softly. You can only hear it if you’re in the living room or the kitchen when they walk by and it always starts at exactly 3:03. The sound starts faint, somewhere near the beginning of the lane near the Carson place. We’re towards the middle of the street, so the whistling moves past us before fading away in the direction of the cul de sac.\n\nWhen I was younger, my sister and I would sneak into the kitchen some nights to listen. Mom and dad didn’t like that and we’d catch Hell if they found us out there but they were never too hard on us since we always stuck to the one Big Rule.\n\nDon’t try to look at whatever was whistling.\n\nMy neighborhood is a funny place. I’ve lived here since I was six and I love it. The houses are small but well-kept, good-sized yards, plenty of places to roam. There are a lot of other kids here my age, I turned 13 back in October. We grew up together and would always play four square in the cul de sac or roam around from back porch to back porch in the summer. This was a good place to grow up, I’m old enough to see it. And there’s only the two strange things here; the night whistling and the good luck.\n\nThe whistling never bothered me much. Like I said, I couldn’t even hear it from my bedroom. But mom and dad don’t like talking about it, so I’ve stopped asking questions. My dad is a strong guy, tall and calm. He has an accent since he moved to the US as a kid. His family, my grandparents, they’re from the islands. That’s what they call it. My dad, the only time he isn’t so calm is if the whistler comes up.\n\nHe talks a little quicker then, eyes move faster, and he tells us not to think about it so much and to always remember the one rule, the Big Rule: don’t try to look outside when the whistler goes past.\n\nNot that we could look even if we wanted. See, there are shutters on the inside of every window, thick pieces of heavy canvas that pull down from the top and latch to the bottom of the window frame. Each latch even has a small lock, about the size of what you’d find on a diary. My dad locks those shutters every night before we all go to bed and keeps the key in his room.\n\nMy mom…I don’t know what she thinks about the whistling. I’ve seen her out in the living room before at 3:03 when the sound starts; I could see her if I cracked my door open just an inch to peek. She’s not out there often, at least I haven’t caught her much, but once or twice a month I think she sits out there on our big red couch just listening.\n\nThe whistler has the same tune every night. It’s…cheerful.\n\n*Da da dada da dum. Da da dada da dum.*\n\nRemember how I said there are two odd things about where I live? Well, besides our night whistler, everyone in my neighborhood is really lucky. It’s hard to explain and dad doesn’t like us talking about this part much, either, but good things just seem to happen to people around here a lot. Usually, it’s small things, winning a radio contest, or getting an unexpected promotion at work, or finding some arrowheads buried in the yard, you know, the authentic kind.\n\nThe weather is pretty good and there’s no crime and everybody’s gardens bloom extra bright in the fall. “A million little blessings,” I’ve heard my mom say about living here. But the main reason we stay here, why we moved here in the first place, is my sister Nola. She was born very sick, something with her lungs. We couldn’t even bring her home when she was born, only visit her in the hospital. She was so small, I remember, small even compared to the other babies. A machine had to breathe for her.\n\nWe moved into our house here to be closer to the hospital. As soon as we moved here, Nola starting getting better. The doctors couldn’t figure it out, they chalked it up to whatever they were doing but we all could tell they were confused. But my parents knew, even I knew, Nola getting better was just another of the million little blessings we got for living in our neighborhood.\n\nSo that’s why we stayed even after we found out that, for every small miracle that happens here every day, now and then…some bad things happen. But they only happen if you look for the whistler.\n\nSee, our neighborhood has a Welcoming Committee. They show up with macaroni casserole and a gift basket and a manila folder whenever someone new moves in. They’re very friendly. Four people showed up when we moved in seven years ago. The committee made small talk, gave me a Snickers bar, and took turns holding Nola. It was her first week out of the hospital so they were extra careful.\n\nThen the committee asked to speak to my parents in private so I was sent to my room where I still managed to hear nearly every word. The Welcoming Committee told my parents about how nice the neighborhood was, really exceptionally, hard-to-explain kind of nice. And then they told my parents about the even harder-to-explain whistling that happened every morning at 3:03 and ended at the tick of 3:05. The group, our new neighbors, warned my parents that the whistling was quiet, would never harm or hurt us, as long as we didn’t look for what was making the sound.\n\nThis part they stressed and I pushed my ear into the door straining to hear them. People who went looking for the whistler had their luck change, sometimes tragically. A black cloud would hang over anyone that looked. Anything that could go wrong, would. The manila envelope the committee brought over contained newspaper clippings, stories about car crashes and ruined lives, public deaths and freak accidents.\n\n“Not everyone dies,” I heard the head of the committee tell my dad. “But the life goes out of ‘em. Even if they live, there’s no light in them ever again, no presence.”\n\nMy mom, I could tell she wasn’t taking it seriously. She kept asking if this was some prank they play on new neighbors. At one point my mom got angry, accused the committee of trying to scare us out of our new home, asked them if they were racist on account of my dad being from the islands. My dad calmed her down, told her he could tell our new neighbors were sincere and they were just trying to help us. He explained that he grew up hearing these kinds of stories from his mom and that he knew there were strange things that walked among us. Some of those strange things were good and some were bad but most were just different.\n\nAfter the committee left, dad went out to the hardware store, bought the canvas blinds, the latches, and the locks and installed them on every window in the house after dinner. That first night in our new house, I crept out of my room at 3 a.m. only to find my dad awake sitting on the living room couch, holding my baby sister. My dad held up his finger in a shh motion but patted the couch next to him. I sat and we waited.\n\nAt exactly 3:03 we heard the whistling.\n\n*Da da dada da dum. Da da dada da dum.*\n\nIt came and it went just like our neighbors said. The whistling returns each night and we never look and we enjoy our million little blessings every day. Nola breathes on her own and she’s grown into a strong, clever girl. My dad even joined the Welcoming Committee. We don’t get new neighbors often, why would anyone want to leave? But when a new family moves in, my dad and the committee bring them macaroni casserole, a gift basket, and the manila folder. I can always tell by the look on my dad’s face when he comes back if the family took the committee seriously or if we’d be getting new neighbors again very soon.\n\nNot long ago a family moved in directly next to us. The previous owner, Ms. Maddie, passed away at age 105. She’d lived a good, long life. Our new neighbors seemed like they’d fit in just fine. They believed the Welcoming Committee, took my dad’s advice about the locking shutters since they had a young child of their own. Whatever newspaper clippings were in that manila envelope, whatever evidence, my dad never let us see. But I imagine it must have been awfully convincing since our neighbors got along with no issues for the first month.\n\nOne night, when our new neighbors had to leave town, they sent their son, Holden, to stay with us. He was 12, a year under me in school. I didn’t know him well before that night but as soon as his parents dropped him off after dinner I could tell it was going to be a bad time.\n\n“Do you know who is always out there whistling every night?” Holden asked the moment the adults left the room.\n\nThe three of us were sitting in the den, some Disney movie playing idly on the television.\n\nMy sister and I exchanged a glance. “We don’t talk about that,” I said.\n\n“I think it’s that weirdo that lives in the big yellow house on the corner,” Holden said.\n\n“Mr. Toles?” my sister asked. “No way, he’s really nice.”\n\nHolden shrugged. “Must be a psycho killer, then.”\n\nNola tensed.\n\n“We don’t talk about it,” I repeated. “Let’s go in my room and play Nintendo.”\n\nWe spent the next few hours playing games, eating popcorn and then watching movies. A typical sleepover but I could see Holden was getting antsy.\n\nAfter my parents had wished us a good night, locked the blinds, and gone to bed, Holden stood up from his bean bag and walked over to where Nola and I were sitting on my bed.\n\n“Have you ever even tried looking?” he asked. “It’s nearly time.”\n\nLike most sleepovers, we’d conveniently ignored any suggestion of a bedtime. I was shocked to see he was right; it was almost 3 a.m.\n\nI sighed. “We don’t-”\n\n“See, I can’t, I can’t even try to look because my dad locks the blinds every night and hides the key,” he continued, ignoring me.\n\n“So does our dad,” said Nola.\n\n“No,” replied Holden. “No, he doesn’t.”\n\n“You saw him do it,” I said, a little sharper than I meant to sound.\n\nHolden grinned. “Your dad locks the blinds, yeah, but he doesn’t hide the key. He keeps it right on his normal key chain.”\n\n“So?” I asked, worried I already knew what he would say next. Because I had noticed that my dad didn’t bother hiding the key anymore after all of these years. Because he knew we took it seriously.\n\n“So, after your dad locked up but before your parents went to bed, I went to the bathroom. And on my way, I may have peeked into their room, and I may have seen your dad’s key chain on his nightstand, and I maybe went and borrowed the key to blinds.”\n\nNola and I stared and his grin only grew wider.\n\n“You’re lying,” I said.\n\nHolden shrugged. “You can check if you want. Just open your parents’ door and look, you’ll see his keychain right there on the nightstand.”\n\n“Stay here,” I told both of them. “Don’t move a muscle.”\n\nI hurried over to my parents’ room but hesitated at the door. If Holden wasn’t lying…my dad would be angry. Beyond angry. I was scared thinking about it. But more scared of an open window with the whistler right outside. I opened the door, barely an inch, and looked in but it was too dark to see. Taking a deep breath, I walked into the room.\n\nTwo steps into the dark I froze. The whistling started. And I could hear it clearly…from my parents’ room. I never realized but they must have heard the sound every night since we moved into the house. They never told us. I don’t think I could have slept through it.\n\nI stood there, listening to the whistling come closer, unsure whether I should turn on a light or call out for my dad. Soft sounds from the living room brought me back to reality.\n\n“Nola,” I yelled, running out of my parents’ room.\n\nHolden and Nola were standing near the front door next to a window. Holden wasn’t lying. I could see him fumbling with the lock on one of the blinds. I heard a click. He did have the key.\n\nHolden let out a quick laugh. Nola stood next to him, hunched up, afraid but maybe curious. The whistling was right outside our house now.\n\nI think I made a sound, called out. I can’t remember. Time felt frozen, clock hands nailed to the face. But I found myself moving. I’m not fast, I’ve never been athletic. Somehow, though, I covered the space between myself and Nola in a moment. My eyes were locked on her but I heard Holden pull the blind all the way down so it could release. I heard the snap of it start to raise, and I heard the whistling just on the other side of the window.\n\nBut I had my arms around Nola and I turned us so she was facing away from the window. At the same time, I jammed my eyes shut.  The blind whipped open.\n\nThe whistling stopped.\n\nI felt Nola shaking in my arms.\n\n“Don’t look, okay?” I told her. “Don’t turn around.”\n\nWe were positioned so that she was facing back towards the hallway and I was facing the window. My eyes were still closed. I felt her nod into my shoulder.\n\nI reached out with the arm not holding Nola and tried to touch Holden. My hand brushed against his arm. He was shaking worse than Nola.\n\n“Holden?” I asked.\n\nSilence.\n\nI reached past him and gingerly felt for the window, eyes still sealed shut. The glass was cold against my fingertips. Colder than it should have been for the time of year. I moved my hand up the window, searching for the string to the blind. The glass began to get warmer the further I reached and there was a gentle hum feeding back into my fingertips. I tried not to think about what might be on the other side of the window. Finally, I touched the string and yanked the blinds shut.\n\nI opened my eyes. In the dim light leaking out from the kitchen, I could make out Holden, pale and small, staring at the now closed window.\n\n“Holden?” I asked again.\n\nHe turned towards me and he *screamed.*\n\nEverything became a flurry of motion. Lights sparked to life in the hall, then the living room. My parents’ footsteps thudded across the hardwood floor. I didn’t turn to look back at them, my eyes were glued to Holden.\n\nHe was pale, had bit his lip so hard there was a thin red line of blood running down his chin and he’d wet himself.\n\n“What happened?” my dad asked from behind me.\n\nI managed to swivel away from Holden and look back. “He looked.”\n\nI’d never seen my dad scared before but I saw it that night, in that moment, an old, ugly terror stitched on his face. A parent’s fear.\n\n“Just Holden?” he mouthed to me.\n\nI nodded yes.\n\nMy dad let out a breath. He looked so relieved I nearly expected him to cheer. But then he turned to Holden and my dad’s face changed. I wondered if he felt bad for feeling good that Holden was the only one that looked.\n\nThere was a knock at the door.\n\nWe all froze. Holden whimpered.\n\n“Don’t answer it,” my mom said.\n\nShe stood at the threshold of the hall. I’d always thought she was a skeptic and just humored my dad about the windows and the whistler but that night we were all believers. I noticed that both of my parents held baseball bats they must have taken from their bedroom.\n\nThe knock came again, a little louder this time.\n\n“Please don’t open the door,” Holden whispered.\n\nMy dad walked over to him, hugged him close.\n\n“We won’t,” my dad promised, still holding his bat. “Nothing is coming in here tonight.”\n\nThud thud thud\n\nThis time the knocking was loud enough to rattle the door. Holden screamed again and Nola clutched her arms around my neck. My mom came over and knelt down next to us, wrapping my sister and me close.\n\n**Thud thud thud**\n\n“Call the police,” my mom whispered to my dad.\n\nThe knocking instantly stopped. My dad looked over his shoulder at us.\n\n“Do you think-”\n\nHe was cut off by frantic knocking that trailed off to a polite tap tap tap.\n\n“*Police*,” something said from the other side of the door.\n\nThe voice from outside sounded exactly like my mom, like a parrot repeating the words back to her.\n\n“*Police*. *Call*. *The police*.” **tap tap tap** “*Police*.”\n\nMy mom pulled us closer.\n\n“*Police*. *Police*. *Police*. *Police*.”\n\n“Please stop,” I heard her whisper.\n\n“I don’t think calling them will help,” my dad said. “How will we know when they’re the ones at the door?”\n\nThe knocking came back harder than before. The door shook. Then it stopped. After a long moment, I heard the knocking again but it was coming from our backdoor.\n\nWe all turned together towards the backdoor but the knocking immediately returned to the front door. Front to back, back to front, loud then quiet then loud again. Suddenly, the sound was coming from both doors at once, big, heavy blows like a sledgehammer. Then something started rapping against all of the windows in the house, then the walls. It was like we were living inside a drum with a dozen people trying to play at once. Or we were a turtle and something was attempting to claw us out of our shell.\n\n“STOP!” Holden yelled.\n\nThe knocking died.\n\n“I won’t tell,” Holden said, staring at the door. “I promise I won’t tell anyone what I saw. Just please go away.”\n\nWe waited for nearly a minute. Then we heard it, a soft *tap tap tap* coming from the window Holden had looked through earlier.\n\nHolden started to cry, sobbing like a prisoner watching gallows being built outside their cell.\n\nMy dad held him, brushed his hair but never lied to him, never told him things would be okay.\n\nThe tapping at the window went on for the rest of the night. We huddled together in the living room for I don’t know how long. Eventually, my mom tried to take us kids into my room while my dad stayed to watch the door. But the second we moved into my bedroom the knocking came back, so loud it was possible to ignore. I was afraid the door couldn’t take it.\n\nWe went back to the living room and the knocking stopped. Only the tap tap tap on the window remained. None of us slept that night.\n\nThe tapping stopped around 7 a.m. That’s about the time the sun comes up here. We waited another two hours before my dad opened the blinds from one window. He made us all go back to my parents’ bedroom first. I heard him open the door then come back in.\n\n“Okay,” he told us. “It’s done.”\n\nHolden’s parents came back around lunchtime. My mom and dad walked Holden over to his house and they all went inside for quite a while. Nola and I watched from the window. She stuck to me the whole day, right at my side, sometimes holding my hand. When my parents came back they looked grim but wouldn’t tell us what they said to Holden’s family. It was a Sunday so we all spent the day together, ordered pizza and watched movies.\n\nThat night everyone slept in my room, Nola and my mom in the bed with me, my dad in a chair he’d pulled over. There was no knocking that night or any night since.\n\nWe didn’t see much of Holden or his parents for the rest of that week but by Thursday there was a moving truck in their driveway. Nola and I watched them packing up the whole afternoon after school. What sticks with me most is how tired Holden and his parents looked. All three had the same pallor, grim mouths and light-less eyes. Even from across the street I could tell something was very wrong. Holden and his family were gone before sunset.\n\nI remember what the original Welcoming Committee said to my parents when we moved in. Not everyone who looks at the whistler dies, but even those that live have the light go out of them and the rest of their lives are full of misfortune. A million little tragedies.\n\nI think Holden’s parents must have looked, either to comfort him if they didn’t believe or share the burden if they did. I watch Nola some days, happy and young and alive, and I wonder if I’d been slower, if she’d looked out the window that night…would I have looked too? To comfort her? To share that burden? I’m glad I don’t have to find out.\n\nWe still live in that house, in that neighborhood. We still hear our whistler walking past every night. The blessings, the luck, the good things here are too good to leave. But we’re careful. We don’t have friends over to spend the night anymore. And my dad hides the key to the blinds very, very well. Not that I’ve gone looking. Some things you just don’t need to look for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GTM](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Grand_Theft_Motto\/comments\/emzy3b\/the_stories\/)\n\n[Hello](https:\/\/travisbrownwriting.com)"},"203":{"title":"She Sold Happiness in Glass Jars","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/b4vyxc\/she_sold_happiness_in_glass_jars\/","flair":null,"author":"flard","selftext":"The poster read, “Happiness! Sold in Glass Jars! Call Today!” and underneath the text was a phone number.\n\nI was walking home from a long, exhausting day of work when I caught a glimpse of the paper stapled on an old telephone pole. I took a picture of it thinking it was amusing.\n\nI was going to show my wife once I got to our apartment, but I was caught up with chores and forgot about it—dinner, dishes, laundry, packing a snack for our daughter, putting her to bed, then putting her toys away that she’d left out in the living room—every night, it was the exact same routine.\n\nThe next day, I awoke sleeping back-to-back with my wife. I always had to get up earlier than she did for my job, so I quietly got ready for the day and headed out the door.\n\nAt work, I was updating the company’s latest expense report. Most days were similar to this one. They were basically paying me to stare at a computer for nine hours a day and input a couple numbers in to a spreadsheet. I finished my work very quickly, so I decided to head out of the office early—it also helped that it was a Friday, and a lot of people leave early at the end of the week.\n\nOn my walk back, I was thinking of what my life had become. I did this often. I always dreamed of traveling when I was younger. I wanted to drive across the country or solo-backpack across Europe. Then I met Kelsey. Don’t get me wrong, I loved Kelsey. I mean, I still do. We just don’t have that spark anymore. When you meet someone and get in a relationship, whether it’s *meant to be* or not, some of your personal life-plans have to be put on hold. And then that relationship turns to marriage, and then you have a baby, then you have to enroll your daughter in a preschool, then you have to get a better paying job and work more hours and blah, blah, blah.\n\nI’m not trying to throw a pity party for myself. I’m just saying I wasn’t exactly content with where I was in my life. I wouldn’t have referred to myself as a happy person.\n\nAs I took the same route home that I did every day to work and back, I walked by the same poster I had passed the day before. I don’t know why, I really don’t, but I decided to call the number. I figured it would be some joke. Maybe someone just picks up and says, “I love you!” on the other end and hangs up. Or maybe it’s a line to a sex-worker. I had no idea what to expect.\n\nI called. It only rang once before someone picked up.\n\n“Hello?” a woman said. \n\n“Uh, hi—um, I’m calling about your poster? Your ad?”\n\n“Oh, awesome,” she said calmly, “when do you wanna pick it up?”\n\n“Pick what up?”\n\n“The jar…” she said, like it was the most obvious thing in the world.\n\n“Oh, of course, um,” I realized then that I had left work early without telling Kelsey, so I could just go pick it up now and she’d be none the wiser, “what exactly is it? That your selling?”\n\n“I just told you. It’s happiness. In a glass jar. Like the poster said. Happiness keeps best in glass jars. They’re more durable than, say, a plastic bag.”\n\n“Um, okay. Should we meet somewhere?”\n\n“For sure. I don’t want you to end up being a creep or something, so let’s go to a public place.”\n\nThe public place we decided on was a Starbucks parking lot a little over a mile from me.\n\nNow, I didn’t think I was really going to be buying a *jar of happiness* or whatever. I was 99% sure she was going to sell me drugs. Maybe heroine would be in the jar. I remember thinking, *Oh no, ‘happiness’ is probably a nickname for some street drug and I’m going to a drug deal. What if she’s a cop? Am I going to be arrested?* But something inside me told me to keep walking, and so I did.\n\nI stood outside and texted her.\n\nMe: **I’m here.**\n\nHer: **Cool. Be there in a sec.**\n\nMe: **What are you driving?**\n\nHer: **Silver Camry.**\n\nAnd as her final text came through, I saw her car pull in. She took a spot not too far from where I stood. I could see there was no one else in the car, which put my kidnapping fear to rest. She opened her door and stood on the pavement, looking around until her eyes met mine. I gave her a little nod of acknowledgment. She simply responded by waving her hand, gesturing for me to come over to her car, so I did.\n\nShe was young, maybe mid-twenties, with curly, golden hair. Her skin was pale and contrasted with the all-black outfit she was wearing. I thought she looked like Glinda the Good Witch from *The Wizard of Oz* had put on the Wicked Witch’s clothes.\n\n“Nice day out,” she said as a greeting.\n\n“Oh, yeah it is. Hadn’t really paid attention to it.”\n\n“You *were* the one that called about the jar, right?”\n\n“Yeah, that was me.”\n\n“Cool, well, here you go.”\n\nShe handed me a very small, glass mason-jar. It couldn’t have been more than two inches tall. Inside of it was a light. Not a light bulb—just light. It was like someone bottled up sunshine. It glowed even in the midafternoon daylight. It looked like a tiny sun, or a tiny universe existing in this little crystal-walled home. I was admiring it with no attempt to hide the awe on my face.\n\n“Pretty rad isn’t it?”\n\n“What—what is it?”\n\n“You’ve asked that, like, three different times, I think. My answer is still the same. It is happiness. Happiness in a glass jar.”\n\n“What do I do with it?”\n\n“Keep it,” She said simply, “if you have any problems shoot me a text.”\n\nShe started to get into her car.\n\n“Wait!” I said, “I thought you were selling this? How much is it?”\n\n“Don’t worry, man,” she said with a smile, “you’ll pay.”\n\nShe closed her door and I stepped out of her way as she backed up, then drove off. What the hell had just happened? What was I holding? I looked down at the jar again, its radiance was simply mesmerizing. I put it in my pocket and could see its glow slightly through my pants. I began to walk home.\n\nWhat was just a nice, sunny day, quickly changed into a rainy one with clouds wrapping the sky. It was not forecasted that it would rain, or else I would’ve ridden the bus or subway to work that day. I jogged home trying not to get too drenched. I finally found shelter once I made it to my apartment building.\n\nI walked up to my door and found that my key wasn’t on my key ring anymore. *Shit, I can’t believe I lost it again,* I thought.\n\nI knocked on the door and said in a somewhat loud voice, “Hey babe it’s me, I don’t know what happened to my key.” I heard the door being unlocked from the other side.\n\nWhen the door opened, I was greeted by a large, heavy-set man with greasy hair and unkempt goatee, he said, “I think you got the wrong door, bud.”\n\n“Oh!” I said, disoriented, “my bad, sorry, have a good one.”\n\nHe let out a chuckle as he closed the door. \n\nApartment number 33.\n\nI know that was my apartment. I know it was. I’d been in apartment 33 for five years now. But *that* was not my apartment. From what I could see inside, all the furniture was different, it was painted a different color, it was all wrong. I felt like I’d hit my head and was drugged. In that moment, nothing made sense.\n\nI pulled out my phone to call Kelsey so she could calm me down and tell me I just got confused for a second. But her contact wasn’t in my phone. In fact, nothing was in my phone. I had no messages with her. No previous calls. No pictures. It was like my phone reset to its factory settings. Did that girl somehow switch my phone out when I wasn’t looking? I would’ve just dialed Kelsey's number manually, but I couldn’t quite remember it. I had known it by heart before, but not anymore. I needed to get back to the office, I had all my contacts backed up on my work computer.\n\nSince it was still raining, I hopped on the bus which had a stop right in front of the apartment complex. I rode downtown toward my office, the whole time staring at my wet shoes, wondering what the hell was going on.\n\nWe have a keycard access to our building so only authorized personnel can get inside. I always keep my access card in my wallet, always. But, surprise, surprise—it wasn’t there. I buzzed in to the speaker we had for guests with appointments, or employees as a back-up in case anyone lost or forgot their card. \n\n**BZZZ** \n\n“Hey this is Tim, I must’ve lost my card. My employee number is…” I stopped as I drew a blank.\n\nA voice came through the Speaker, “Tim? You got cut out, what’s your employee number?\"\n\n“Um, I can’t remember, I—”\n\n“That’s fine, just tell me your full name and department.”\n\n“Uh, finance. I’m in finance. My full name is Tim Brooks.”\n\n“One sec.”\n\nAbout thirty seconds later, the man spoke to me again.\n\n“We don’t have a Tim Brooks working in this building. Did you have an appointment with someone?”\n\nI backed up in surprise, almost tripping on my own feet. I had just been in that office an hour or two ago. What was happening to me? I felt like I was getting Alzheimer’s but going through every stage in one day. I stared at my hands, unsure if I was in the right body. I felt like the world around me was disintegrating. I wasn’t in control, I was merely sitting inside somebody else’s head, watching the world through their eyes.\n\nJust then, I got a text. I recognized the number immediately, it was that girl. The one who gave me the jar. I had forgotten all about it until I saw her text.\n\nHer: **Hey. How’s it going?**\n\nI looked at my phone, dumbfounded. It made me angry she was so nonchalant about this. *She* knew what was going on. *She* had done this somehow.\n\nMe: **What the hell did you do to me?!**\n\nHer: **The worst is yet to come.**\n\nI was astronomically close to just chucking my phone as far as I could in frustration. I took the jar out of my pocket. It looked unchanged, still glowing just as bright.\n\n“What the fuck did you do!” I yelled at the jar, realizing I probably looked like a lunatic.\n\nAs I stared at its glistening glass, I realized something. I didn’t know what my wife’s face looked like anymore. I knew her name. Well, I know it started with a K, or maybe a C. I couldn’t picture her in my mind. I knew I had a wife. I knew I did. Yes, because I had a daughter. I had a wife and a daughter. I just, couldn’t remember their faces then—or their names, or their birthdays, or any memories I had with them.\n\nI know they existed. They did exist. I had just seen them that morning, right? I couldn’t remember how she looked, or what she smelled like. What was our first date? We had a wedding, right? What about our first kiss? Or my daughter—or was it my son? Maybe I didn’t even have a kid. But my wife, or girlfriend, she was real. I knew she was. The thought was tearing me apart. I couldn’t see her in my head. I couldn’t recall a single fact about her.\n\nI was standing outside of the same building, but I was unsure why I was. Did I work there? I must work somewhere. The rain was accompanied by a chilly wind now. It was whipping at my face, making my nose and cheeks sting. I wanted to go home. I wanted to be with her. I wanted to be warm. I wanted to go in to a shitty office job that kept a roof over my head. I wanted it all. I was soaking wet. I was miserable. I couldn’t remember my parents, or my childhood. Did I even have any friends? Why was I in the rain?\n\nI looked down at my hand. I was still clutching the jar. The only memory of my entire life I could concretely remember was that girl giving it to me. Telling me it was happiness. It did not bring happiness. It brought pain. It bought suffering. I was more miserable in that moment than I’d ever been.\n\nMy phone buzzed:\n\n**Break the jar, Tim.**\n\nI looked at my other hand. With the setting sun and the rainy sky, I swear the jar glowed brighter than any street light near me. I didn’t break it because I was following her instruction. I broke it because I was angry. I broke it because I was upset. I needed a release. I raised my arm above my head, and brought it down with one swift motion, shattering the jar on the concrete beneath my feet.\n\nThat dark, chilly air accompanying the rain spread away like it was the shockwave of a bomb going off, and I was at the epicenter. I saw the warm, yellow light from inside the jar spread rapidly across the ground and ascend into the sky. It was as if I was watching the beginnings of the universe being created—like God had just snapped his fingers and said, “let there be light.” I was engulfed in it. I could no longer see street or rain, or anything dark. I felt like I was plummeting into a star going faster than the speed of light. It felt like sitting in front of a fire on a cold winter’s night, but that warmth was covering every inch by body.\n\nAnd then I blinked.\n\nImmediately I could feel the sheets beneath me, and my back barely touching my wife’s. I was staring out the window. The morning light drenched through the glass and gleamed on my face.\n\nI stood from bed and grabbed my phone. It was Friday morning. I had one text:\n\n**Let me know if you ever need another jar :)**\n\nI called in sick to work. I snuck into my daughter’s room and greeted her with a kiss and told her she didn’t have to go to preschool today. We were going to have a family day. She smiled and stretched out her arms with a yawn before curling up and falling back asleep. \n\nI got back in bed and squeezed my wife tightly. I didn’t let go for hours. Our daughter came into our room and woke us up eventually—she was jumping on the bed and shouting for us to wake up. Yesterday I may have found that annoying. Yesterday I may have found a lot of things annoying, or monotonous, or dull.\n\nBut not today. Today, I pulled her under the covers in between me and Kelsey.\n\nToday was going to be a good day. Today, I was happy."},"204":{"title":"A Shattered Life","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/7txais\/a_shattered_life\/","flair":null,"author":"M59Gar","selftext":"I don't know when you're going to read this, but I can tell you when it started: I was out for a walk alone in the woods when the entity came for me. It was beyond a blur. It was, for lack of a better term, absence of meaning. Where it hid, there were no trees; where it crept closer, there was no grass; through the arc it leapt at me, there was no breeze of motion. There was no air at all.\n\nAs it struck, I felt the distinct sensation of claws puncturing me somewhere unseen; somewhere I'd never felt before. My hands and arms and legs and torso seemed fine and I wasn't bleeding, but I knew I'd been injured somehow. As I fearfully ran back home, I could tell that I was less. I was vaguely tired, and it was hard to focus at times.\n\nThe solution at that early stage was easy: a big cup of coffee helped me feel normal again.\n\nFor a while, that subtle drain on my spirit became lost in the ebb and flow of caffeine in my system. You could say my life began that week, actually, because that was when I met Mar. She and I got along great, though, to be honest, I'm pretty sure I fell in love with her over the phone before we even met.\n\nIt was almost as if the strong emotions of that first week made the entity fight back—it was still with me, latched on to some invisible part of my being.\n\nThe first few incidents were minor, and I hardly worried about them. The color of a neighbor's car changed from dark blue to black one morning, and I stared at it before shaking my head and shrugging off the difference. Two days later, at work, a coworker's name changed from Fred to Dan. I carefully asked around, but everyone said his name had always been Dan. I figured I'd just been mistaken.\n\nThen, as ridiculous as this sounds, I was peeing in my bathroom at home when I suddenly found myself on a random street. I was still in my pajamas, pants down, and urinating—but now in full view of a dozen people at a bus stop. Horrified, I pulled up my clothes and ran before someone called the cops. I did manage to get home, but the experience forced me to admit that I was still in danger. The entity was doing something to me, and I didn't understand how to fight back.\n\nMar showed up that evening, but she had her own key.\n\n\"Hey,\" I asked her with confusion. \"How'd you get a key?\"\n\nShe just laughed. \"You're cute. Are you sure you're okay with this?\" She opened a door and entered a room full of boxes. \"I know living together is a big step, especially when we've only been dating three months.\"\n\nLiving together? I'd literally just met her the week before. Thing was, my mother had always called me a smart cookie for a reason. I knew when to shut my yap. Instead of causing a scene, I told her everything was fine—and then I went straight to my room and began investigating.\n\nMy things were just as I had left them with no sign of a three month gap in habitation, but I did find something out of the ordinary: the date. I shivered angrily as I processed the truth.\n\nThe entity had eaten three months of my life.\n\nWhat the hell was I facing? What kind of creature could consume pieces of one's soul like that? I'd missed the most exciting part of a new relationship, and I would never understand any shared stories or in-jokes from that period. Something absurdly precious had been taken from me, and I was furious.\n\nThat fury helped suppress the entity. I never imbibed alcohol. I drank coffee religiously. I checked the date every time I woke up. For three years, I managed to live each day while observing nothing more than minor alterations. A social fact here and there—someone's job, how many kids they had, that sort of thing—the layout of nearby streets, the time my favorite television show aired, that kind of thing. Always, those changes reminded me the creature still had its claws sunk into my spirit. Not once in three years did I ever let myself zone out.\n\nOne day, I grew careless. I let myself get really into the season finale of my favorite show. It was gripping; a fantastic story. Right at the height of the action, a young boy came up to my lounger and shook my arm.\n\nSurprised, I asked, \"Who are you? How did you get in here?\"\n\nHe laughed and smiled brightly. \"Silly Daddy!\"\n\nMy heart sank in my chest. I knew immediately what had happened. After a few masked questions, I discovered that he was two years old—and that he was my son.\n\nThe agony and heartache filling my chest was nearly unbearable. Not only had I missed the birth of my son, I would never see or know the first years of his life. Mar and I had obviously gotten married and started a family in the time I'd lost, and I had no idea what joys or pains those years contained.\n\nIt was snowing outside. Holding my sudden son in my lap, I sat and watched the flakes fall outside. What kind of life was this going to be if slips in concentration could cost me years? I had to get help.\n\nThe church had no idea what to do. The priests didn't believe me, and told me I had a health issue rather than some sort of possession.\n\nThe doctors didn't have any clue. Nothing showed up on all their scans and tests, but they happily took my money in return for nothing.\n\nBy the time I ran out of options, I'd decided to tell Mar. There was no way to know what this all looked like from her side. What was I like when I wasn't there? Did I still take our son to school? Did I still do my job? Clearly, I did, because she seemed to be none the wiser, but I still had a horrible feeling that something must have been missing in her life when I wasn't actually home inside my own head.\n\nBut the night I set up a nice dinner in preparation, she arrived not by unlocking the front door, but by knocking on it. I answered, and found that she was in a nice dress.\n\nShe was happily surprised by the settings on the table. \"A fancy dinner for a second date? I knew you were sweet on me!\"\n\nThank the Lord I knew when to keep my mouth shut. If I'd gone on about being married and having a son, she might have run for the hills. Instead, I took her coat and sat down for our second date.\n\nThrough carefully crafted questions, I managed to deduce the truth. This really was our second date. She saw relief and happiness in me, but interpreted that as dating jitters. I was just excited to realize that the entity wasn't necessarily eating whole portions of my life. The symptoms, as I was beginning to understand them, were more like the consequences of a shattered soul. The creature had wounded me; broken me into pieces. Perhaps I was to live my life out of order, but at least I would actually get to live it. \n\nAnd so it went for a few years—from my perspective. While minor changes in politics or geography would happen daily, major shifts in my mental location only happened every couple months. When I found myself in a new place and time in my life, I just shut up and listened, making sure to get the lay of the land before doing anything to avoid making mistakes. On the farthest-flung leap yet, I met my six-year-old grandson, and I asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up. He said, \"Writer.\" I told him that was a fine idea.\n\nThen, I was back in month two of my relationship with Mar, and I had the best night with her on the riverfront. When I say the best, I mean *the best*. Knowing how special she would become to me, I asked her to move in. I got to live through what I'd missed the first go-around, and I came to understand that I was never mentally absent. I would always be there—eventually. When we were moving her boxes in, she stopped for a moment and said she marveled at my great love, as if I'd known her for a lifetime and never once doubted she was the one.\n\nThat was the first time I'd truly laughed freely and wholeheartedly since the entity had wounded me. She was right about my love for her, but for exactly the reason she'd considered a silly romantic analogy. I *had* known her my whole life, and I'd come to terms with my situation and found peace with it. It wasn't so bad to have sneak peeks at all the best parts ahead.\n\nBut of course I wouldn't be writing this if it hadn't gotten worse. The entity was still with me. It had not wounded me and departed like I'd wanted to believe. The closest I can describe my growing understanding was that the creature was burrowing deeper into my psyche, fracturing it into smaller pieces. Instead of months between major shifts, I began having only weeks. Once I noticed that trend, I feared my ultimate fate would be to jump between times in my life heartbeat by heartbeat, forever confused, forever lost. Only an instant in each time meant I would never be able to speak with anyone else, never be able to hold a conversation, never express or receive love.\n\nAs the true depth of that fear came upon me, I sat in an older version of me and watched the snow falling outside. That was the one constant in my life: the weather didn't care who I was or what pains I had to face. Nature was always there. The falling snow was always like a little hook that kept me in a place; the pure emotional peace it brought was like a panacea on my mental wounds, and I'd never yet shifted while watching the pattern of falling white and thinking of the times I'd gone sledding or built a snow fort as a child.\n\nA teenager touched my arm. \"Grandpa?\"\n\n\"Eh?\" He'd startled me out of my thoughts, so I was less careful than usual. \"Who are you?\"\n\nHe half-grinned, as if not sure whether I was joking. Handing me a stack of papers, he said, \"It's my first attempt at a novel. Would you read it and tell me what you think?\"\n\nAhh, of course. \"Pursuing that dream of being a writer, I see.\"\n\nHe burned bright red. \"Trying to, anyway.\"\n\n\"All right. Run off, I'll read this right now.\" The words were blurry, and, annoyed, I looked for glasses I probably had for reading. Being old was *terrible*, and I wanted to leap back into a younger year—but not before I read his book. I found my glasses in a sweater pocket, and began leafing through. Mar puttered in and out of the living room, still beautiful, but I had to focus. I didn't know how much time I would have there.\n\nIt seemed that we had relatives over. Was it Christmas? A pair of adults and a couple kids I didn't recognize tromped through the hallway, and I saw my son, now adult, walk by with his wife on the way out the door. As a group, the extended family began sledding outside.\n\nFinally, I finished reading the story, and I called out for my grandson. He rushed down the stairs and into the living room. \"How was it?\"\n\n\"Well, it's terrible,\" I told him truthfully. \"But it's terrible for all the right reasons. You're still a young man, so your characters behave like young people, but the structure of the story itself is very solid.\" I paused. \"I didn't expect it to turn out to be a horror story.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"It's a reflection of the times. Expectations for the future are dismal, not hopeful like they used to be.\"\n\n\"You're far too young to be aware like that,\" I told him. An idea occurred to me. \"If you're into horror, do you know anything about strange creatures?\"\n\n\"Sure. I read everything I can. I love it.\"\n\nWarily, I scanned the entrances to the living room. Everyone was busy outside. For the first time, I opened up to someone in my life about what I was experiencing. In hushed tones, I told him about my fragmented consciousness.\n\nFor a teenager, he took it well. \"You're serious?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe donned the determined look of a grown man accepting a quest. \"I'll look into it, see what I can find out. You should start writing down everything you experience. Build some data. Maybe we can map your psychic wound.\"\n\nWow. \"Sounds like a plan.\" I was surprised. That made sense, and I hadn't expected him to have a serious response. \"But how will I get all the notes in one place?\"\n\n\"Let's come up with somewhere for you to leave them,\" he said, frowning with thought. \"Then I'll get them, and we can trace the path you're taking through your own life, see if there's a pattern.\"\n\nFor the first time since the situation had gotten worse, I felt hope again. \"How about under the stairs? Nobody ever goes under there.\"\n\n\"Sure.\" He turned and left the living room.\n\nI peered after him. I heard him banging around near the stairs.\n\nFinally, he returned with a box, laid it on the carpet, and opened it to reveal a bursting stack of papers. He exclaimed, \"Holy crap!\"—but of course, being a teenager, he didn't really say *crap*.\n\nTaken aback, I blinked rapidly, forgiving his cussing because of the shock. \"Did I write those?\"\n\nHe looked up at me with wonder. \"Yeah. Or, you will. You still have to write them and put them under the stairs after this.\" He gazed back down at the papers—then covered the box. \"So you probably shouldn't see what they say. That could get weird.\"\n\nThat much I understood. \"Right.\"\n\nHe gulped. \"There are like fifty boxes under there, all filled up like this. Deciphering these will take a very long time.\" His tone dropped to deadly seriousness. \"But I will save you, grandpa. Because I don't think anyone else can.\" \n\nTears flowed down my cheeks then, and I couldn't help but sob once or twice. I hadn't realized how lonely I'd become in my shifting prison of awareness until I finally had someone who understood. \"Thank you. Thank you so much.\"\n\nAnd then I was young again, and at work on a random Tuesday. Once the sadness and relief faded, anger and determination replaced them. After I finished my work, I grabbed some paper and began writing. While the weeks shifted around me, while those weeks became days, and then hours, I wrote every single spare moment about when and where I thought I was. I put them under the stairs out of order; my first box was actually the thirtieth, and my last box was the first. Once I had over fifty boxes written from my perspective—and once my shifting became a matter of minutes—I knew it was up to my grandson to take it from there.\n\nI put my head down and stopped looking. I couldn't stand the river of changing awareness any longer. Names and places and dates and jobs and colors and people were all wrong and different.\n\nI'd never been older. I sat watching the snow fall. A man of at least thirty that I vaguely recognized entered the room. \"Come on, I think I finally figured it out.\"\n\nI was so frail that moving was painful. \"Are you him? Are you my grandson?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" He took me to a room filled with strange equipment and sat me in a rubber chair facing a large mirror twice the height of a man. \"The pattern finally revealed itself.\"\n\n\"How long have you worked on this?\" I asked him, aghast. \"Tell me you didn't miss your life like I'm missing mine!\"\n\nHis expression was both stone cold and furiously resolute. \"It'll be worth it.\" He brought two thin metal rods close to my arm and then nodded at the mirror. \"Look. This shock is carefully calibrated.\"\n\nThe electric zap from his device was startling, but not painful. In the mirror, I saw a rapid arcing light-silhouette appear above my head and shoulder. The electricity moved through the creature like a wave, briefly revealing the terrible nature of what was happening to me. A bulging leech-like mouth was wrapped around the back of my head, coming down to my eyebrows and touching each ear, and its slug-like body ran over my shoulder and into my very soul.\n\nIt was a parasite.\n\nAnd it was feeding on my mind.\n\nMy now-adult grandson held my hand as I took in the horror. After a moment, he asked, \"Removing it is going to hurt very badly. Are you up for this?\"\n\nFearful, I asked, \"Is Mar here?\"\n\nHis face softened. \"No. Not for a few years now.\"\n\nI could tell from his reaction what had happened, but I didn't want it to be true. \"How?\"\n\n\"We have this conversation a lot,\" he responded. \"Are you sure you want to know? It never makes you feel better.\"\n\nTears brimmed in my eyes. \"Then I don't care if it hurts, or if I die. I don't want to stay in a time where she's not alive.\"\n\nHe made a sympathetic noise of understanding and then returned to his machines to hook several wires, diodes, and other bits of technology to my limbs and forehead. While he did so, he talked. \"I've worked for two decades to figure this out, and I've had a ton of help from other researchers of the occult. This parasite doesn't technically exist in our plane. It's one of the lesser spawns of µ¬ßµ, and it feeds on the plexus of mind, soul, and quantum consciousness\/reality. When details like names and colors of objects changed, you weren't going crazy. The web of your existence was merely losing strands as the creature ate its way through you.\"\n\nI didn't fully understand. I looked up in confusion as he placed a circlet of electronics like a crown on my head in exact line with where the parasite's mouth had ringed me. \"What's µ¬ßµ?\"\n\nHe paused his work and grew pale. \"I forgot that you wouldn't know. You're lucky, believe me.\" After a deep breath, he began moving again, and placed his fingers near a few switches. \"Ready? This is carefully tuned to make your nervous system extremely unappetizing to the parasite, but it's basically electro-shock therapy.\"\n\nI could still see Mar's smile. Even though she was dead, I'd just been with her moments ago. \"Do it.\"\n\nThe click of a switch echoed in my ears, and I almost laughed at how mild the electricity was. It didn't feel like anything—at least at first. Then, I saw the mirror shaking, and my body within that image convulsing. Oh. No. It did hurt. Nothing had ever been more painful. It was just so excruciating that my mind hadn't been able to immediately process it. \n\nAs my vision shook and fire burned in every nerve in my body, I could see the reflected trembling light-silhouette of the parasite on my head as it writhed in agony equal to mine. It had claws—six clawed lizard-like limbs under its leech-like body—and it cut into me in an attempt to stay latched on.\n\nThe electricity made my memories flare.\n\nMar's smile was foremost, lit brightly in front of a warm fire as the snow fell past the window behind her. The edges of that memory began lighting up, and I realized that my life *was* one continuous stretch of experience—it was only the awareness of it that had been fragmented by that feasting evil on my back.\n\nI'd never managed to be there for the birth of my son. I'd jumped around it a dozen times, but never actually lived it. For the first time, I got to hold Mar's hand and be there for her.\n\nNo. *No!* That moment had shifted seamlessly into holding her hand as she lay in a hospital bed for a very different reason. Not this! God, why? It was so merciless to make me remember this. I broke down in tears as nurses rushed into the room. I didn't want to know. I didn't want to experience it. I'd seen all the good parts, but I hadn't wanted the worst part—the inevitable end that all would one day face.\n\nIt wasn't worth it. It was tainted. All that joy was given back ten thousand fold as pain.\n\nThe fire in my body and in my brain surged to sheer white torture, and I screamed.\n\nMy scream faded into a surprised shout as the machines and electricity and chair faded away. Snow was no longer falling around my life; I was out in the woods on a bright summer day.\n\nOh God.\n\nI turned to see the creature approaching me. It was the same absence of meaning; the same blank on reality. It crept forward, just like before—but, this time, it hissed and turned away. I stood, astounded at being young again and freed from the parasite. My grandson had actually done it! He'd made me an unappetizing meal, so the predator of mind and soul had moved on in search of a different snack.\n\nI returned home in a daze.\n\nAnd while I was sitting there processing all that had happened, the phone rang. I looked at it in awe and sadness. I knew who it was. It was Marjorie, calling for the first time for some trivial reason she'd admit thirty years later was made up just to talk to me.\n\nBut all I could see was her lying in that hospital bed dying. It was going to end in unspeakable pain and loneliness. I would become an old man, left to sit by myself in an empty house, his soulmate gone long before him. At the end of it all, the only thing I would have left: sitting and watching the falling snow.\n\nBut now, thanks to my grandson, I would also have my memories. It would be a wild ride, no matter how it ended.\n\nOn a sudden impulse, I picked up the phone. With a smile, I asked, \"Hey, who's this?\"\n\nEven though I already knew.\n\n---\n\nAuthor's note: Together, my grandfather and I did set out to write the tale of his life. Unfortunately, his Alzheimer's disease progressed rapidly, and we were never able to finish. He's still alive, but I imagine that, mentally, he is in a better place than the nursing home. I like to think he's back in his younger days, living life and being happy, because the reality is much colder. It's snowing today; he loves the snow. When I visited him, he didn't recognize me, but he did smile as he sat looking out the window.\n\n---\n\n[Blog](http:\/\/mattdymerski.com\/) [FB](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MattDymerskiAuthor\/) [Tw](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MattDymerski)[.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/cLqsc)"},"205":{"title":"My job is watching a woman trapped in a room.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/brco33\/my_job_is_watching_a_woman_trapped_in_a_room\/","flair":"Series","author":"Verastahl","selftext":"Three years ago I was looking at the local job classifieds online when one of the ads caught my eye, not because of what it said, but because it said so little.  Best I remember, the ad just read “Job available.  Good pay.  No benefits.  Discretion required.”  It then listed an email address and that was all.  At the time I was managing a music store, but I had already started hearing rumors we would be shutting down within the next year and the likelihood of a transfer to another store was slim. I had been morosely looking at job listings for the last few days, but this was the first one that stood out, if only because I was bored and it was weird.\n\nSo I sent an email.\n\nHalf an hour later I had a response, telling me to go to a particular office building in an upscale part of the city at a precise time for my “screening”.  I went, and after waiting for a few minutes in the lobby, I was taken into an office where I was given a series of forms and questionnaires to fill out.  They collected them and told me they would be in touch.\n\nI had almost forgotten about the whole thing until a month later I got a call saying I had moved on to the second stage of the hiring process.  I was again given an address and time, and when I arrived (this time it was a different nice office park twenty miles away from the first one), I was met by a man who introduced himself as Mr. Solomon.  He escorted me into a large room that contained a chair and a desk.  On the desk were two large monitors, a keyboard and mouse, and a bolted down metal box with two oversized buttons on it:  One red and one green.\n\nHe told me this room was a model for the place I would be working if I took the job.  He described the job as follows.\n\nI would be working seven shifts of six hours every week.  My job would be simple.  I would arrive at work ten minutes early and enter an outer area that was like a locker room.  I would have my own personal locker.  I would store all belongings in the locker and change into the provided work clothes.  I was never, under any circumstances, to carry any item of my own into the surveillance room.  I was never, under any circumstances, to take any item with me from the surveillance room.\n\nAs for what I was to do in the surveillance room, I was told that the monitor on the left would constantly show a live stream from a high-definition camera in a remote location.  My job was simply to watch the camera.  Once an hour I would get onto the computer attached to the right monitor and enter a brief log describing anything interesting that occurred in the last hour.  I would have no pens or pencils or paper, and I should never try to take any kind of written notes about the work.\n\nAs for the red and green buttons, the red button was only to be used if there was an emergency.  This meant something on the video or in my workspace that required outside help.  The green button was to be hit if I saw something on the video feed that was particularly noteworthy.  It would tell other people somewhere that, at least in my opinion, something interesting was going on.  Solomon stressed that while I was given discretion on when to use this button, I should err on the side of only using it if and when something “of real significance” occurred.\n\nHe pointed out the camera on the ceiling of the room we were in.  He said the real room would be the same.  My work would be observed, and other people were watching the room on the video feed as well.  He said I was only a redundancy in case other systems failed.  He then smirked and asked if I knew what he meant by redundancy.\n\nI nodded, trying not to show my irritation.  I don’t talk that good to people, so sometimes they think I’m dumb.  That’s okay.  Let him think that if he paid me good enough.\n\nThe pay was very good.  Thirty-five dollars an hour.  \n\nThis worried me.  I was already thinking this was some kind of psych experiment or secret government job, which I was okay with.  But that kind of money to sit and watch a screen?  My mom always told me that if something seems too good to be true, it probably is, and this was seeming too good to be true.\n\nI asked if I was going to be doing anything illegal.  Solomon laughed and said no.  I asked if anyone was going to get hurt.  Again, he shook his head no.  He said the reason they were paying so much was because they needed employees that were motivated to be professional and discrete.  The work they were doing was important, and for various reasons it couldn’t be discussed.  If I took the job, I would have to sign papers promising I would never discuss my work there or I could be sued or locked up.  I’m only breaking that now because of everything that’s happened.\n\nSo I took the job, and because they wanted me to start right away, I had to quit the store with no notice.  I felt bad about that, but I was excited about the new job too.  It was a lot of money and seemed like easy enough work, if a bit boring.  I was nervous that there was something more to it, but I told myself I would just have to see.  No point in chickening out and wasting a good chance because I let my imagination go crazy.\nI was given the location of the job itself, and when I went there, I was amazed that it really was just like the model room I had been shown with only a few differences.  There was a locker room you had to pass through to enter the surveillance room and there was a small bathroom attached to the real surveillance room also.  The real room had a small water cooler in the corner, but because I wasn’t allowed to bring anything in with me, I had to eat before or after every shift.  The biggest difference, of course, was that the monitors were turned on.\n\nThe right monitor was just a black and white terminal like you see in movies some times.  I could type in my logs, but no internet to look at or anything like that.  The left monitor…\n\nIt was video from a room.  You would call it a bedroom I guess, because it had a bed in it, but it had lots of other stuff too.  A T.V., a sofa and chairs, a couple of tables, and plenty of empty space in between.  The camera must be high up in a corner, because I could see pretty much everything except for the far sides of furniture.  At first though, I didn’t notice any of that stuff.  \n\nAll I saw was her.\n\nShe looked to be a little older than me and was very pretty.  When I first saw her, she was laying on her side on the sofa.  That was the part of the room farthest from the camera, but the picture was very clear and I could tell that she was sleeping.  I found myself leaning into the monitor more so I could see her better, and then I thought about what I was doing and felt embarrassed.  It’s like I was spying on her.  A Peeping Tom, my mom used to call it.\n\nI didn’t want to be a Peeping Tom, but I didn’t want to be silly either.  I needed to think about it slow.  \n\nIt was a good job.  And I wasn’t doing anything wrong, right?  I wasn’t hurting anybody.  The woman looked fine.  And the room was nice.  She probably agreed to be there and it’s all some experiment or something.  I was just overreacting.\n\nSo I sat down in the chair and began my work.\n\n**** \n\nIt didn’t take long before I understood more.  The woman, I took to calling her Rachel, wasn’t there of her free will.  I never saw her hurt, but it was clear that she never left that room except to go into what I think is a bathroom area that my camera couldn’t see.  Well, she never left the room on her own.  Periodically, usually a couple of times a week during my shifts, men and women in strange-looking outfits would come in and take her from the room.  Sometimes she would struggle, but usually she would just go along with her head hung low.\n\nThey would always bring her back, though the times when she wasn’t brought back during my shift were always the worst for me.  I would worry about her until I got to work the next day and saw her in the room watching T.V. or painting.  She never looked hurt or even that upset except for when they took her, and even when she fought, they were always gentle with her.  \n\nStill, I knew something was wrong.  I considered quitting the job, or hitting the red button and getting someone to come so I could get some answers.  Or calling the police and showing them what the camera was showing me.\n\nExcept I was scared.  Scared of losing my job,  and scared of what these people might do to me if I quit or told on them.  Solomon had told me when I took the job that part of being discreet was not asking questions.  I would never be asked to do more than I had already been told, but I could never tell anyone what I did or saw, and I could never ask questions about what I was doing or why.\n\nSo I made excuses.  It was all an experiment.  She was crazy or sick and they were trying to help her.  She was doing a job just like I was.  Or if she really was a prisoner somewhere, at least I was watching to make sure that she was okay.  If they ever tried to hurt her, or I saw that she really didn’t want to be there for sure, I could get help then.  In a way, I told myself, I was helping to protect her by watching.\n\nI don’t expect you to think much of my excuses.  I don’t think much of them myself, especially now.  But in my defense, when things changed, I didn’t ignore it or try to explain it away.  I knew something had to be done.\n\n****\n\nRachel would usually paint for an hour or two every day, and it seemed to always be during my afternoon shifts.  The room had no windows as far as I could tell, but I guess she either used a clock or her own body’s time to keep to a kind of schedule.  I always liked to watch her paint—the thing she was painting was always facing the wrong way for me to see it, but I could see her face as she worked.  She always looked peaceful and happy when she was painting, and seeing her that way, smiling serenely from time to time as she got something the way she wanted it, always made my day.\n\nI first noticed something was wrong when she started painting more frequently a few weeks ago.  Her expression was more focused and serious, and there was a tension to her movements that I wasn’t used to seeing.  At first I thought she was just really trying to work hard on something, and I wanted to tell her not to worry.  Every few weeks the others would come in and take the old paintings out anyway, bringing in a new stack of…I think the word is canvas.\n\nBut it was more than her being focused.  Something was wrong.  She didn’t look happy and she was going for hours at a time.  In the span of three days, she had finished four paintings.\n\nI had been growing more and more worried watching her work, and when she finished the fourth, I found myself telling her to just stop and rest awhile.  I had grown accustomed to talking to the monitor, talking to *her* in my own way.  But she didn’t stop.  Instead she began moving the paintings.  Arranging them on the back and seat of the long sofa at the far end of the room.  \n\nThis was the first time I had gotten to see any of the paintings.  Even when the others were taking them out, they always seemed to be turned away from the camera.  I was still worried about her, but I was also happy to finally see something she had worked on.  Happy and amazed.\n\nThey were beautiful.  One was a beautiful green forest.  Another was an old stone well.  A third was a house sitting alone on a small island.  The last was an old-fashioned looking movie theater.  All of them looked like something out of a dream, with trailing lines of color mixing in the air around them like leaves caught in a wind.  It was only when I looked close that I realized the lines of color weren’t random.  They were words.  Easy to miss if you weren’t looking close, and by themselves, they didn’t seem to mean much.  Just the ghost of a word somewhere in each of the paintings, easy to lose in everything else that was being shown.\n\nI leaned into the monitor and squinted, trying to read the words.  Then my heart started thudding as I made them out.  Blinking and rubbing my eyes, I looked again, reading them out loud in order—left to right, top pair then bottom.\n\n“Please.”\n\n“Help.”\n\n“Me.”\n\n“Thomas.”\n\nI pushed back from the monitor, my hand over my mouth.  I didn’t know what to do.  I didn’t know how any of this could be happening.  It wasn’t just that she was asking for help, though that was a big part of it.  \n\n[It was that *my* name is Thomas.](https:\/\/redd.it\/9ndww5)\n\n****\n\n[Part Two](https:\/\/redd.it\/brsj8v)"},"206":{"title":"I'm a Search and Rescue Officer for the US Forest Service, I have some stories to tell","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3iex1h\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/","flair":null,"author":"searchandrescuewoods","selftext":"I wasn't sure where else to post these stories, so I figured I'd share them here. I've been an SAR officer for a few years now, and along the way I've seen some things that I think you guys will be interested in. \n\n* I have a pretty good track record for finding missing people. Most of the time they just wander off the path, or slip down a small cliff, and they can't find their way back. The majority of them have heard the old 'stay where you are' thing, and they don't wander far. But I've had two cases where that didn't happen. Both bother me a lot, and I use them as motivation to search even harder on the missing persons cases I get called on. \nThe first was a little boy who was out berry-picking with his parents. He and his sister were together, and both of them went missing around the same time. Their parents lost sight of them for a few seconds, and in that time both the kids apparently wandered off. When their parents couldn't find them, they called us, and we came out to search the area. We found the daughter pretty quickly, and when we asked where her brother was, she told us that he'd been taken away by 'the bear man.' She said he gave her berries and told her to stay quiet, that he wanted to play with her brother for a while. The last she saw of her brother, he was riding on the shoulders of 'the bear man' and seemed calm. Of course, our first thought was abduction, but we never found a trace of another human being in that area. The little girl was also insistent that he wasn't a normal man, but that he was tall and covered in hair, 'like a bear', and that he had a 'weird face.' We searched that area for *weeks*, it was one of the longest calls I've ever been on, but we never found a single trace of that kid. \nThe other was a young woman who was out hiking with her mom and grandpa. According to the mother, her daughter had climbed up a tree to get a better view of the forest, and she'd never come back down. They waited at the base of the tree for hours, calling her name, before they called for help. Again, we searched everywhere, and we never found a trace of her. I have no idea where she could possibly have gone, because neither her mother or grandpa saw her come down.\n\n* A few times, I've been out on my own searching with a canine, and they've tried to lead me straight up cliffs. Not hills, not even rock faces. Straight, sheer cliffs with no possible handholds. It's always baffling, and in those cases we usually find the person on the other side of the cliff, or miles away from where the canine has led us. I'm sure there's an explanation, but it's sort of strange.\n\n* One particularly sad case involved the recovery of a body. A nine-year-old girl fell down an embankment and got impaled on a dead tree at the base. It was a complete freak accident, but I'll never forget the sound her mother made when we told her what had happened. She saw the body bag being loaded into the ambulance, and she let out the most haunting, heart-broken wail I've ever heard. It was like her whole life was crashing down around her, and a part of her had died with her daughter. I heard from another SAR officer that she killed herself a few weeks after it happened. She couldn't live with the loss of her daughter.\n\n* I was teamed up with another SAR officer because we'd received reports of bears in the area. We were looking for a guy who hadn't come home from a climbing trip when he was supposed to, and we ended up having to do some serious climbing to get to where we figured he'd be. We found him trapped in a small crevasse with a broken leg. It was not pleasant. He'd been there for almost two days, and his leg was very obviously infected. We were able to get him into a chopper, and I heard from one of the EMTs that the guy was absolutely inconsolable. He kept talking about how he'd been doing fine, and when he'd gotten to the top, a man had been there. He said the guy had no climbing equipment, and he was wearing a parka and ski pants. He walked up to the guy, and when the guy turned around, he said he had no face. It was just blank. He freaked out, and ended up trying to get off the mountain too fast, which is why he'd fallen. He said he could hear the guy all night, climbing down the mountain and letting out these horrible muffled screams. That story bothered the hell out of me. I'm glad I wasn't there to hear it. \n\n* One of the scariest things I've ever had happen to me involved the search for a young woman who'd gotten separated from her hiking group. We were out until late at night, because the dogs had picked up her scent. When we found her, she was curled up under a large rotted log. She was missing her shoes and pack, and she was clearly in shock. She didn't have any injuries, and we were able to get her to walk with us back to base ops. Along the way, she kept looking behind us and asking us why 'that big man with black eyes' was following us. We couldn't see anyone, so we just wrote it off as some weird symptom of shock. But the closer we got to base, the more agitated this woman got. She kept asking me to tell him to stop 'making faces' at her. At one point she stopped and turned around and started yelling into the forest, saying that she wanted him to leave her alone. She wasn't going to go with him, she said, and she wouldn't give us to him. We finally got her to keep moving, but we started hearing these weird noises coming from all around us. It was almost like coughing, but more rhythmic and deeper. It was almost insect-like, I don't really know how else to describe it. When we were within site of base ops, the woman turns to me, and her eyes are about as wide as I can imagine a human could open them. She touches my shoulder and says 'He says to tell you to speed up. He doesn't like looking at the scar on your neck.' I have a very small scar on the base of my neck, but it's mostly hidden under my collar, and I have no idea how this woman saw it. Right after she says it, I hear that weird coughing right in my ear, and I just about jumped out of my skin. I hustled her to ops, trying not to show how freaked out I was, but I have to say I was really happy when we left the area that night.\n\n* This is the last one I'll tell, and it's probably the weirdest story I have. Now, I don't know if this is true in every SAR unit, but in mine, it's sort of an unspoken, regular thing we run into. You can try asking about it with other SAR officers, but even if they know what you're talking about, they probably won't say anything about it. We've been told not to talk about it by our superiors, and at this point we've all gotten so used to it that it doesn't even seem weird anymore.\nOn just about every case where we're really far into the wilderness, I'm talking 30 or 40 miles, at some point we'll find a staircase in the middle of the woods. It's almost like if you took the stairs in your house, cut them out, and put them in the forest. I asked about it the first time I saw some, and the other officer just told me not to worry about it, that it was normal. Everyone I asked said the same thing. I wanted to go check them out, but I was told, very emphatically, that I should never go near any of them. I just sort of ignore them now when I run into them because it happens so frequently. \n\nI have a lot more stories, and I suppose if anyone's interested, I'll tell some of them tomorrow. If anyone has any theories about the stairs, or if you've seen them too, let me know. \n\n**EDIT: Part 2 is up: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3ijnt6\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/**"},"207":{"title":"The previous tenant of my new flat left a survival guide.

We’ve been together for 5 years now and we’re old and wise enough to settle down and finally leave our parents houses. He just turned 24 and I’m 22. He’s the love of my life. His name is Jamie and I couldn’t be happier to be living with him. \n\nWhen we decided to make the leap we spent 2 months looking at flats and houses, we couldn’t afford to buy yet so renting was our only option but the prices were astronomical. For our budget we would have been lucky to get a box room and a stove.\n\nJamie works for a local 24 hour fast food restaurant and I’m training to be a teacher. The early stages of training don’t pay much and I owe a lot in student loans so finances are tough. \n\nWe had almost given up hope until we found our flat. It was nothing special, but to us it was a palace. A spacious 2 bedroom apartment with views of a city park, a balcony and local conveniences. It was in a tower block in a not so nice area, but neither of us had been wealthy growing up, we weren’t fussy. Just grateful to be together. \n\nThe advert was sweetened by the deposit free option and open ended tenancy. The landlord was happy to sign a five year contract if we wanted. That sort of thing never happens in the city. We were told that along with no deposit we would also have no inspections, but would be liable to pay for any damage when we ended the tenancy. I’d never heard of anything quite like it.\n\nWe knew that for our budget and location we weren’t going to get any better. We snapped the place up fast, not even bothering to view it. It felt like our only chance. \n\nMove in day rolled around quickly and yesterday we got the keys to our first home together, it was such a strange feeling. The day was chaos, getting our stuff in and up in the lift. We were flat number 42, on the 7th floor. The items we couldn’t get in the lift had to be taken up all the stairs by the removal men. I think they were grateful we weren’t any higher but I still wish we had been able to give them a better tip. \n\nIn the evening we settled down on our second hand sofa, given to us by a cousin of a friend and watched some tv. We smoked cigarettes on the balcony looking at the park and fell asleep on our mattress on the floor super early because we had no energy to put the bed together yet and Jamie had work at a hideous time of the morning. \n\nWe slept soundly last night, I felt safe and happy. I don’t think that feeling is coming back any time soon and it’s all due to the note I found this morning. \n\nI found it in the kitchen, having a coffee, hours after Jamie had left for his early shift at work. It was in one of the cupboards that were fixed to the wall, there were a bunch of useful items from the previous tenant. Spare keys to the flat, a set of tiny keys that locked and unlocked the windows (necessary for those with kids this high up), spare smoke alarm batteries and a folded up piece of paper. \n\nThe note was handwritten with “New occupier of flat 42” in beautiful cursive on the blank side. I opened it up and sat down to read. I can’t really describe it to you, so I’m going to copy it out below. \n\n*Dear New Occupier,*\n\n*Firstly, welcome to your new home. I lived here before you for 35 years with my husband. Unfortunately he had an incident at home recently that I’d rather not discuss that claimed his life. My sister has now decided I can’t keep up with the demands of the property and has insisted that I move in with her and her husband. I was reluctant at first, but the stairs do kill me at my age and without Bernie it’s filled with sadness.*\n\n*Anyway. When you’ve lived somewhere for as long as I have it feels like a person that you know. You understand it’s personality and what makes it tick. I thought it was probably pertinent that I impart some of that knowledge on you.*\n\n*It’s a wonderful home, honestly, I have lived through best and worst years and leaving it behind is very emotional but if you are to survive and get the best out of it then there are some steps you need to follow.*\n\n*1. The landlord will never bother you, he doesn’t visit, call or communicate in any way. But make sure to pay your rent in a timely fashion always. I have only dealt with him once in 35 years and let’s just say I never missed another rent day. Any repairs required you speak to the agent you rented the place with.*\n\n*2. DO NOT use the communal lift between 1.11 and 3.33 am. Just don’t do it. This step is vital if you are to have a happy life here. It really is life or death. Don’t do it. This has cost me and many others in the building greatly and I would rather not elaborate on why you shouldn’t do this. Just please don’t do it. I cannot stress this enough.*\n\n*3. When you hear the strange animal noises coming from flat 48 don’t question it, Mr Prentice lives there and he’s a lovely chap. Don’t be afraid to say hello to him in the corridor or on the stairs (he’s old school, so he never risks the lift) but whatever you do, don’t check on him when you hear the noises. You’ll know when you hear them.*\n\n*4. If you ever come across a window cleaner on the balcony ignore him. He may seem like the nicest fellow you’ve ever had trying to sell you something at the door but it really is best that you don’t engage. He will go away if you ignore him. But he tries pretty hard the first few times so you’ll need some resilience. Whatever you do, don’t offer him anything. No money, no hot drink.*\n\n*5. Don’t leave food scraps out. Bin or refrigerate them immediately. If you have small animals, it is imperative that you watch them eat and take away any leftover food immediately after they are done. This and rule 2 go hand in hand, the things forage all day and seem to really love animal feed. You don’t want them in your flat. I promise. You can leave what you want out between 1.11 and 3.33am so you may want to feed your pets then.*\n\n*6. Don’t communicate with any neighbours who claim to come from flats 65-72. These flats suffered a fire in the late 80s that devastated the whole floor, all the residents died in their homes. The building was mostly council owned at the time and they never bothered to renovate the flats. They’ve been empty ever since but every now and again someone will knock at your door claiming to live in one of these flats and ask to borrow some sugar. They will seem entirely average but you must shut and lock the door immediately. I installed two extra security bolts to avoid these fuckers. I don’t like to swear at my age but they really are fuckers.*\n\n*7. Simple one for you here, keep a weapon in each room. Sometimes you follow all these steps and something still slips through the net. Better to be safe than sorry.*\n\n*8. The building has a committee that will try and get you to join. It’s one of those neighbours groups about improving living conditions for all residents. It’s a nice group and the lady who runs it - Terri from flat 26- is a fantastic neighbour. By all means get involved. But I wouldn’t recommend babysitting Terri’s 2 children. She’ll ask you, because the poor woman needs a break, but if you accept don’t say I didn’t warn you.*\n\n*9. Stray hairless cats sometimes roam in the hallway. I know they’re supposedly a special, expensive breed, but they don’t belong to anyone. They’re mostly  harmless, but don’t pick them up. Not unless you see one of those neighbours that claims to live in 65-72. Then grab the cat and lock it inside with you. It’ll burn your skin a little but the cats are friendly and I wouldn’t want to see them hurt.*\n\n*10. There is no way to fix the damp patch on the ceiling in the bedroom. Sometimes it will turn a deep crimson and look quite concerning, but please try not to be alarmed, it doesn’t drip, it doesn’t get any bigger and it’s been there longer than I have. The landlord won’t budge on it, according the the agents. I flagged it many times, even called the police the first night it changed colour, but it was a waste of time and it will be for you too. It’s best to ignore it.*\n\n*11. You can trust the postman. His name is Ian Flanders and he’s been the postman since before I moved in. He has his own key to the main door and delivers post to the door every morning at 8.54. I can’t include everything here, or it would become a novel but if you have any questions Ian will help you.*\n\n*12. Finally, the first few weeks are the worst. You’ll feel like you’ve made a mistake, I’m sure reading this you already do, but if you can get through the first few weeks it really is a lovely block to live in. Every property has it quirks and this one is a little extra special, but you can be truly happy here if you just take my advice. I wish you all the best, I really do.*\n\n*Yours truly*, \n\n*Mrs Prudence Hemmings*\n\nI don’t really know what to think after reading the note. Hopefully it was some sort of joke but the agent had said the previous tenant was an elderly lady and I can’t see anyone named Prudence Hemmings attempting to play practical jokes on someone they’d never met. \n\nThere were also parts of the note I couldn’t disprove, there was indeed a large damp patch above the bed that me and Jamie had already discussed reporting. No crimson but it definitely existed. I had also commented on a beautiful Sphynx cat roaming the halls as we were moving in. I started to get seriously freaked out.\n\nOur dream, our beautiful little home had just become a source of fear and confusion. I checked the time and it was 9.14. Damn it. Out of time to catch postman Ian. When I opened the door to check, sure enough, two letters addressed to a Mrs Hemmings sat on the doorstep. \n\nAt about 11.15 my worst fears were truly confirmed when a friendly middle aged looking man carrying window cleaning equipment knocked on my balcony door. I ignored him. I didn’t want to take the risk until I’d spoken to Jamie and showed him the note. I’d texted him already to rush home. I felt bad as the man rapped his knuckles against the door for over 10 minutes, but honestly the longer it went on the more I was terrified. \n\nMy windows were sparkling, and due to our lack of curtains I couldn’t even hide from his gaze. I felt so exposed. He stayed for a total of 30 minutes exactly and never once did he stop looking at me or knocking. He shouted the occasional ultra friendly line or humble request for a beverage in the heat through the door but I did my best to avoid eye contact. \n\nWhen he finally left I looked outside every window in the flat, but I couldn’t see him on any of the other balconies or see any equipment suggesting he was around. He had vanished completely. \n\nJamie still hadn’t text me back, he must have been having a rough shift, it was a Friday and they were always busy. It wasn’t often that he didn’t reply. He was due home in around an hour anyway.\n\nI read the note probably hundreds of times over, I tortured myself reading it for the next hour. Desperately waiting for Jamie to come through the door to tell me it was all crazy and I should relax. \n\nI hoped for that so much.\n\nBut Jamie never came. His shift should have finished around midday but by 2pm he still wasn’t home. I panicked, I cried, I left over 100 voice messages on his phone but got nowhere. I finally decided it had been long enough that calling his work wouldn’t embarrass him and his boss told me that he had never turned up for his shift. \n\nI thought about it, what could have happened?  And then it hit me. Jamie’s shift started at 4am today. He would have left the flat at 3.15 and taken the lift down the stairs. \n\nI don’t know what to do. I’ve tried to convince myself it was all just a big joke. Maybe Jamie wrote the note and got his boss in on it. A voice in my head kept telling me that he couldn’t write like that if he tried but I had to attempt to fool myself. It’s getting late and he still isn’t home, what if it’s all true?

Shoot me in the temple, aiming slightly downwards. I need the bullet to travel the shortest possible distance through my brain before it hits my hippocampus. If I’m lucky, the sensation of the gunshot ripping through my skull will only last a few decades.\n\nAs awful as this sounds, you’ll be doing me an enormous favor. Death by a headshot, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, is vastly better than the alternative.\n\nMy ordeal started over ten thousand years ago, at 10:15 this morning. I earn extra money by participating in drug trials. I’m a so-called “healthy subject” who takes experimental drugs to help assess side effects. Once it was a kidney drug. A few times it’s been something for blood pressure or cholesterol. This morning they told me the drug I took was a psychoactive substance intended to accelerate brain function.\n\nNone of the drugs I had tested so far have ever done anything for me, in the recreational sense. In other words, none of the drugs I’ve tested have given me a killer buzz, or mellowed me out, or anything. Maybe I’ve always ended up the placebo group, but nothing I’ve tested had affected me at all.\n\nToday’s drug was different. This shit *worked*. They gave me a pill at 10:15 and told me to hang out in the waiting room until they called me back for some tests. “Only about thirty minutes,” the research assistant told me. I flopped onto the waiting room couch and read a few articles from a copy of Psychology Today that was sitting on the coffee table. They hadn’t called me back when I finished the Psychology Today so I picked up a US News and read it cover-to-cover. Then I read an old Scientific American. *What was taking them so damn long*?\n\nI sluggishly turned my head to look at the wall clock. It was only 10:23 am. I had read all three magazines in eight minutes. I remember thinking this was going to be a long day. I was right.\n\nThe waiting room had little bookshelf with some used hardcovers on it. When I stood up to walk to the bookshelf it felt like my legs barely worked. It’s not that they were weak. They were just slow. It took a full minute just to stand up off the couch, and another minute to take two steps to the bookcase.\n\nI scanned the old books on the shelf and picked out a copy of Moby Dick. My arms had the same problems as my legs. Just reaching one foot in front of me to grab the book took a long time. I actually got bored just waiting for my hand to reach the spine of the book.\n\nI slogged back to the couch and collapsed onto it in a slow-motion fall that reminded me of the low-gravity hops of astronauts on the moon. I opened Moby Dick (slowly) and began reading. I started with *Call me Ishmael* and got as far as Ahab throwing his pipe into the sea (which was all the way to friggin chapter *thirty*) before they called me back.\n\n“How are you feeling?” the research assistant asked me.\n\n“I feel slow,” I said.\n\n“Actually, it’s the other way around. Everything seems slow because you’re so fast.”\n\n“But my legs. My arms. They’re moving in slow motion.”\n\n“Your body seems like it’s moving slowly because your brain is fast. Your brain is running ten or twenty times faster than normal. You are thinking and perceiving reality at an accelerated pace. But your body is still constrained by the laws of biomechanics. Frankly, you’re moving much faster than a normal person,” she pantomimed a jogging motion. “But your brain is running so much faster right now, that even your fast walk seems very slow to you.”\n\nI thought about my slow-motion flop onto the waiting room couch. Even if my muscles had slowed down, my body would still react to gravity the same way. But in the waiting room, I even *fell* in slow motion. Slow muscles couldn’t explain why gravity seemed weaker. My brain was going at warp ten. That’s how I managed to read three magazines and the first thirty chapters of Moby Dick in fifteen minutes.\n\nThey ran a series of tests on me. The physical tests were fun. They made me juggle three balls. Then four. Then six. I had no problem keeping six balls in the air because they seemed to be moving so slowly. It was boring, frankly, waiting for each ball to move through its arc so I could catch it (with my slow-motion hands) and toss it back into the air. They threw cheerios in the air and I caught them with chopsticks. They dropped a handful of coins and I counted the total value before they hit the ground.\n\nThe cognitive tests were less fun, but very illuminating. Finish a fifty-word word search (three seconds). Solve an intricate maze drawn onto a poster-sized paper (two seconds). View a slide show projected at ten images per second and answer detailed questions about what I saw (95% correct).\n\nThey told me I measured over 250 on the Knopf scale. Apparently, that’s deep into the superhuman range of thinking speeds.\n\nThen they sent me home. “It’ll wear off in a few hours,” they said. “Which will seem like days to you. Try to use the residual effects to get some work done. Catch up on work emails while you’re still in high-speed mode!”\n\nThe ride home was *horrible*. It was only three metro stops, and in real-world time, it only took about thirty-five minutes. But in my drug-accelerated hyper-time, it felt like days. *Days*. Just walking out of the medical research suite to the elevator seemed like it took an hour. I sprinted out of the office, willing my legs to push me faster. But, the laws of biomechanics held me prisoner. As accelerated as my brain was, I couldn’t do anything to make my legs work faster.\n\nThe huge disconnect between my body and mind made it extremely difficult to judge how and when to slow down, turn, or rotate my body. I had basically turned into giant, slow-motion spaz. I misjudged my speed and rammed into the wall by the elevator button at a pretty good speed. Even though I could see the wall coming at me, I couldn’t make my finger, outstretched to hit the elevator button, move away fast enough and I jammed it against the wall. Hard. The pain was intense. If my brain had been running at regular speed, it probably only would have hurt for thirty seconds or so. But in my accelerated state, the intense pain seemed to last for half an hour. Forty-five minutes maybe.\n\nThe elevator ride was horrible. It felt like I spent four or five hours just descending seven floors, with nothing to look at but the interior of the elevator car.\n\nI sprinted to the metro station. I have to admit, this part was almost fun. Even though my body moved at, what seemed to me, super-slow speed, I could still carefully choose how and where to place my feet, swing my arms, and turn my torso. It only took a block or two to getting used to having a brain that ran two dozen times faster than my body. Then I basically sprint-danced the rest of the way, twisting and juking between people on the sidewalk and dodging moving cars with inches (a.k.a. minutes) of clearance.\n\nI spent an hour, in my time frame, descending into the subway and running to the platform. Endless tedium waiting the six minutes for the red-line train to arrive. Although there was more to look at on the metro platform than inside the elevator, it was still intensely boring. I should have stolen that copy of Moby Dick.\n\nThe red-line train roared into the station in slow-motion. The normally high-pitched squeal of its brakes was frequency shifted by my high-speed mind to a long low tone, like a monotone Tuba solo.\n\nIt wasn’t just the squealing subway train that was three octaves lower than normal. All sound was slowed to the point of near inaudibility. Voices were gone, shifted below the threshold frequency of my hearing. I did manage to hear a screaming baby on my subway car – her shrieks slowed to sound like whale songs. Sharp sounds like a car horns and trucks bouncing over potholes were low, muddied roars like distant thunder.\n\nBack at the research offices, I could still hear and communicate with the research staff. But now verbal communication with anyone would be impossible. The effects of the drug were still intensifying.\n\nI spent what seemed like days on that fucking red-line train. Days. Listening to the whale-song of the screaming baby and the Tuba solo of the brakes. Where ordinary voices were frequency-shifted out of my audio range, smells didn’t seem to be affected. I never became nose-blind to the body odor, the stench of the train’s brakes, and mélange of farts and other smells wafting through the metro car.\n\nI *finally* got back to my apartment. Sprinting through my open door and into the front hall at full speed was like a slow, relaxing drift down a lazy river.\n\nI was relieved to be home. At least I had stuff I could do there. I picked up the book I was reading – One Hundred Years of Solitude – and finished it. Despite turning the pages so quickly that I tore many of them, it seemed like most of the time I spent finishing the book was spent on page turning and not actually reading. Three minutes had passed since I got home.\n\nI tried surfing the Internet (my GOD it takes a long time for computers to boot these days) but it was too frustratingly slow. Hours (seemingly) to load each new page, and a fraction of a second to read it. A hundred articles in my news feed read and just three more minutes done.\n\nI dipped into my pile of yet-to-be-read books and finished two more. Four more minutes had passed.\n\nI decided to try to sleep off the remaining effects of the drug. Unfortunately, whatever part of my mind is responsible for perception, the part that’s been accelerated to hyper speeds by the drug, isn’t the same as the part that governs sleep. Despite being awake for what I perceived as days, my physical brain still thought it was 1:25 pm. It was not ready for sleep.\n\nNevertheless, I *tried* to sleep. I walked to my bedroom (a slow 45-minute drift through my apartment) and flung myself into bed (lazily falling like a feather onto the mattress). I closed my eyes and lay there for hours and hours (10 minutes of reality time) before giving up. Sleep would not come. I was facing what was going to feel like days, or maybe even weeks of being trapped in a slow-motion prison.\n\nSo I took an Ambien.\n\nThe sensation of the pill and the splash of water I used to swallow it sliding my throat was sickening. A lump that blocked my breathing, moving like a slug down my esophagus.\n\nI read a book. Ten minutes had passed. I read another. Eighteen minutes since I took the Ambien. I threw the book across the room in disgust at my situation. The book slowly pirouetted and spun through the air, like a leaf blowing in a breeze. It hit the wall with a long, faint rumble – the only sound I had head for what seemed like hours – then drifted to the floor like a flip-flop sinking in a swimming pool.\n\nThe force of gravity hadn’t changed since I took the pill. The laws of physics were the same. It was just my perception of time that had gone wackadoo. This meant I could use the speed things seemed to fall as a way of judging the effects of the drug. Based on how long it took the book to drift to the floor, I estimated the effects of the drug were *still* intensifying.\n\nI read a magazine. I turned on the television – I clearly saw each frame of video like I was watching a slideshow. Frustrated, I turned the television off.\n\nI read some more. The first two books of *Churchill’s A History of the English-Speaking Peoples*. Not exactly a light read. Frankly, I hated it. But given the hours of tedium it would take to go get another book off my bookshelf, just sitting on the couch and reading Churchill was better. Or at least less worse.\n\nIt had now been thirty-five minutes since I took the Ambien. I lay down on the couch and closed my eyes. Time passed. I inhaled – a hours long process. Time passed. I exhaled for more hours.\n\nSleep. Would. Not. Come.\n\nI needed a new plan. I decided to go back to the offices where they gave me the drug. Maybe they would have something that could counteract its effects. Or at least something to knock me out until it wore off.\n\nI exited my apartment as fast as possible – taking hours in my time-frame to do so. I didn’t even bother locking the door. It would have taken too long.\n\nDown the stairs (it’s faster than the elevator if you run), through the lobby, out the front door and onto the street. These few things felt like a long day at the office.\n\nSprinting down the street, dancing and weaving between pedestrians with, what must have looked to them, superhuman dexterity. Down the first flight of stairs at the metro. Across the landing. Another hour. Then on to the second flight of stairs. That’s when the Ambien hit me.\n\nThe Ambien didn’t make me sleepy. Not at all. Instead, it must have had a severe cross-reaction with the experimental drug I took this morning. I was bounding down the second flight of stairs, moving in slow motion, but still making perceptible progress. Then, wham – everything stopped.\n\nThe dull roar of the street and metro noise ceased, replaced by the most perfect silence I’ve ever experienced. My downwards motion seemed to completely freeze. Before the Ambien kicked in, my perception of time was maybe a few hundred times slower than real-time. After the Ambien took effect, time moved *thousands* of times slower. Every second seemed like days to me. Even just moving my eyes to focus on a new point was like an impossibly slow scroll across my visual field.\n\nOver the course of the afternoon, I learned how to walk, run, and jump when my mind ran hundreds of times faster than my body. But with another four or five orders of magnitude of slow-down caused by the Ambien, body control was almost impossible. I fell on the stairs. Even though I was all-but-frozen in mid-step, controlling my muscles was impossible. I commanded my foot forwards for hours, then backwards for hours more when it seemed like I would miss the next step. Hours attempting to adjust the angle of my ankle, then re-adjusting when it felt wrong.\n\nDespite these efforts, I rolled my ankle on the next step. The pain wasn’t at all mitigated by the slowness. Hours of increasing strain on my bent ankle. The nerve signals that send pain into the brain must work differently than the nerves in my ear. Sonic energy was spread out over time, diluted until it was imperceptible. Pain flowed into my brain undiluted by the change in my perception of time. Hours and hours of increasing weight on my turned ankle turned into hours of increasing pain upon increasing pain.\n\nI pitched forwards, my high-speed mind completely unable to control my low-speed body. I drifted downwards for days, managing to rotate my torso enough to keep my head from impacting the ground first. I eventually landed on my right shoulder. At first the impact wasn’t even noticeable. Then I felt a slight pressure in my shoulder as it came in contact with the ground. The pressure grew, bringing increasing pain, for hour upon hour. My shoulder finally gave out, popping out of its socket with an endless sickening tug.\n\nI came to a stop days later, crumpled onto the ground, staring at the ceiling. The pain in my shoulder still screaming with the intensity of a fresh violent injury. I had plenty of time to think during that fall. If every second seemed like days to me, then each minute of real-world time would be like *years*. Even if the drug cleared out of my system in the next two or three hours, this nightmare would seem to last *centuries*.\n\nBy the time I hit the ground, I had a plan. I would somehow get to the platform and throw myself in front of a train.\n\nI twisted onto my hands and knees. Days of my dislocated shoulder crying for relief. I misjudged my rotation and rolled onto my back. I tried again, collapsing onto my face as I tried to figure out how to control a body that moved slower than grass grew. *Weeks* of effort were finally rewarded with success – I stabilized on my hands and knees.\n\nIf just getting on all fours was this difficult, I figured that walking or running was completely out of the question. So I crawled. I crawled through the metro tunnel. The dumb looks on the faces in the crowd lingered on me for weeks. I crawled under the turnstyle and onto the escalator.\n\nThe escalator spilled the rush-hour crowd onto the platform at the same speed a glacier spills ice into the sea. I looked out over the crowded platform during my interminable downward ride. The train status sign said the next train wouldn’t arrive for *twenty minutes*. Twenty minutes was like a year to me. I’d have to spend a year on the metro platform, waiting to die.\n\nI crawled off the escalator, enduring days of stupid expressions on the commuters’ faces. I crawled a few feet to a concrete bench and curled up next to it, trying to find a position to lessen the pain in my shoulder. Then my problem with time got worse. Impossibly worse.\n\nThe massive slowdown on the stairs was just the beginning of the interaction between the experimental drug and the Ambien. It fully hit me while I was curled up by the bench. I blinked. Years of darkness followed. Sound was already gone, and with my blink, sight was gone as well. All that existed was the pain from my fall.\n\nMy hyper-accelerated mind wasted no time compensating for the lack of sensory input. Voices spoke to me. They sung to me in languages that never existed. Patterns and faces and colors came and went in my mind’s eye. I recalled my whole life, and imagined living another. I forgot English. I settled into a profound despair. I spoke to God. I became God. I imagined a new universe and brought it to life with my thoughts. Then I did it all again. And again.\n\nMy eyes opened with geologic slowness. A faint glow. Weeks. A slit of light. Weeks. A narrow view of the metro platform – ankles of the commuters near me and an advertisement on the opposite wall.\n\nI extracted my phone from my pocket. A project that spanned decades. How can I even explain the boredom? The pain in my shoulder is nothing compared to the boredom. Every thought I can think, I have thought hundreds of times already. The view of ankles and advertisements never changes. Never. The boredom is so intense it’s tangible – like a solid object of metal and stone wedged into my skull. Inescapable.\n\nWhat are my options? If I crawl and fall onto the tracks without an oncoming train to crush me, I won’t die. I’ll experience even more pain from the four-foot fall, but I’ll most likely be rescued by some do-gooder on the platform and unable to act when the train finally does arrive. My suffering in that scenario will be endless.\n\nSo I wait for the train. So I can throw myself under it. When it finally hits me, I will experience the pain of being ripped to pieces for centuries until finally, the light of life leaves my brain, and my experience ends.\n\nI’ve lived hundreds of lifespans at the foot of this bench. I am far older, in spirit, than any human who has ever lived. Most of my life experience has been a snapshot of pain huddled on the floor of a subway platform, with an unchanging view of ankles and advertisements.\n\nThis post is my plan B. My Hail Mary. My long-shot. I’ve spent lifetimes typing and posting this message in the hope that someone will read it and become convinced that my suffering must end. Someone on this platform right now. Someone who will find the man curled under the bench, the man who crawled down the escalator, and kill him as swiftly as possible. A bullet to the temple.\n\nIf you’re armed and at the Glenmont metro, please shoot me.\n\n[pfd](https:\/\/www.anewkindofmonster.com\/)"},"209":{"title":"Spacegirl","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/declk8\/spacegirl\/","flair":"Spooktober","author":"HeadOfSpectre","selftext":"We called her Spacegirl.   \n\n\nHer real name was Megan Daniels, but nobody actually called her that. She’d been Spacegirl since Grade 2. She was the kind of kid who stuck out in the crowd with her long red hair, ghostly pale skin and coke bottle glasses. For as long as I’d known her, Spacegirl had been quiet. She didn’t like to be around us. She didn’t play with us when we were kids, she didn’t even talk much.  \n\n\nMost of the time, she’d find somewhere to sit, far away from everyone else. Then she’d open up her little notebook and scribble inside of it. Sometimes she wrote poems, sometimes she drew. But she was always off on her own little world. Nowadays, I understand why we targeted her. She was different, and she was alone. That doesn’t justify any of it, but kids can be cruel. I remember that it was Sasha Brown who told me that Spacegirl was retarded because her Mother was on drugs. She probably just made that up. But we all believed it. She had always been the worst towards Spacegirl, and she kept that up until the end.   \n\n\nIt all started in Grade 5 when Sasha took her notebook.\n\nIt had been raining that day, so we’d had an indoor recess. Spacegirl sat in the corner at her desk, eyes focused on her notebook as she methodically worked on a drawing. Sasha and I had been sitting nearby at our desks, and we simply just watched her do her thing.\n\n  “I can’t believe they let that retard sit in with us.” Sasha murmured, “Look at her… Why do they even let them in schools? They aren’t gonna learn anything.”  \n   “Better than leaving her at home with her crackhead Mom.” Said Tanya Evrett. She and I weren’t exactly friends, but she sat close to Sasha and I. “My Dad says he sees a different car in front of her house every day. He says that she lets boys come and they pay her so they can have S-E-X.” None of us could actually say the dreaded S word at the time. Sex was still a terrible unknown thing, and we all had been raised to believe that nobody decent would ever do it.  \n\n\nSpacegirl paused, and her eyes darted away from her book, to look at us. I can only imagine she’d heard us. Sasha just stared right back at her.   \n\n\n  “What? Do you have a problem, Spacegirl?” She asked. The Teacher was out of earshot, and that gave her carte blanche to say whatever she wanted. Spacegirl didn’t respond. She just looked back down at her notebook, but Sasha had been challenged (or at least she thought she’d been). She looked over to the Teachers desk to make sure she was busy, then she got up and moved closer to Spacegirl. \n\n  “What are you even doing in there, retard?” \n\nShe’d reached out to snatch the book before Spacegirl could stop her. \n\n  “What even is this? A Unicorn? What are you, five?” \n\nShe handed the book to me, and I took it on instinct. There was a brightly colored drawing of a Unicorn inside. The artwork was actually pretty nice, but I would never have said so. The book was passed on to Tanya next, and Spacegirl could only look at us helplessly. \n\n  “Wow. You can’t even draw. Look at this?”\n\nShe tore the page out of the notebook, and Spacegirl let out a startled whimper, as if she’d been struck. The picture was crumpled up and the book was thrown on the floor by Spacegirls desk.\n\n  “Draw something that isn’t trash next time.” Tanya said, and Sasha just giggled as if it was anything other than being mean spirited just for the sake of it. \n\nSpacegirl slowly picked her book up off the floor, avoiding eye contact as Tanya and Sasha turned away from her. I continued to stare. I remember that the way she moved was so defeated, as if she were shrinking in on herself. She looked up at me, but only for a moment and I felt bad for her. I really did. But I didn’t do anything about it. I just left her to rejoin the others.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter that, Spacegirl became an easy target for Sasha and Tanya. Every chance they got, they’d harass her and I regret to admit that I was usually right there with them.\n\nDuring the days where we could go outside for recess, Spacegirl would always sit beneath the same tree, always working in her notebook. When she did, we would always lean on the trunk and look down over Spacegirls shoulder.\n\n  “Wow, that’s really good, Spacegirl.” Was how most of her comments would start, “Did you mean to draw it like it got hit by a truck, or is that just your style?”\n\nThere was never a compliment. She would always find something to needle.\n\n  “Can you draw me?” Sasha asked once, “I heard that retards were always like, art geniuses or something. Maybe it’ll even look like a person!”\n\nSpacegirl didn’t look up at her. She seemed to be trying not to acknowledge the insults. I won’t pretend like I was blameless either. I never stopped them, and there were plenty of times where I was right there, making fun of her because that was what we did, and we weren’t the only ones. More or less everyone hurt her in some way or another. But she never complained. I think she was too scared to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was late December in 7th grade where things got even worse. I don’t know all the details, and I don’t know just for how long things had been boiling over, but I’d heard a rumor that James Hardy had it out for Spacegirl.  \n\n\nJames had only been in my class a few times, and he wasn’t in my class that year. He was a small, mousy looking kid who was convinced he was the world's toughest gangster. The rumors said that someone had seen his Dad going into Spacegirls house. Naturally there had been speculation that they'd been having sex. Someone told me that James’ parents had been divorcing because of it. Somehow all of these rumors had mutated into claims that James and Spacegirl were dating and I think that was what had rubbed him the wrong way.  \n\n\nWe were coming in from recess when some boys decided to pull a little prank on James. The whole prank had been set up by Brian Jordan and his brother Mike. They had some mistletoe for the Holiday season, and had set it up in the hall leading back to our classroom. Mike had grabbed Spacegirl during recess and were holding her behind the door where the mistletoe was. When James walked through, they pushed her at him and snapped a picture. I’d been just behind James when it happened. I watched as Spacegirl came flying out of seemingly nowhere, eyes wide and afraid, then slammed into James. They both hit the ground, and I could hear the other boys laughing.  \n\n\n  “LOOK! She wanted to give you a kiss!” One the boys said. Spacegirl was trying to crawl away from James and pick up her notebook, but somebody had kicked it out of sight. I remember that she looked back towards James, and there were tears in her eyes. She must have been terrified with everything that was going on. She clearly hadn’t wanted any part in this, but there she was at the center of it.\n\n “You fucking faggot assholes!” James yelled as he picked himself up.\n\n  “Hey, she just wanted to give you a smooch!” aughed Brian, “Come on, give her a kiss!” \n\nSomeone pushed Spacegirl towards James, and he glared at her as if all of this was her fault. She tried to stand and run, but he was angry and he wasn’t thinking straight. I watched as he grabbed her and hit her. A square punch to the jaw. Then he tossed her to the ground and went after Brian next. A teacher had to get in to pull James off of him. He, Spacegirl and the Jordan Brothers ended up getting suspended right before the Christmas holidays. We didn’t see Spacegirl until January… we didn’t see James or his friends ever again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn Christmas Eve, there was a car accident on the highway outside of my town. Supposedly it had swerved off the road to avoid an animal of some kind, and gone into a ditch. Mike, Brian and their parents didn’t survive. On December 27th, James was killed while outside shoveling his driveway. My Parents told me that he’d been attacked by an animal. Probably a deer or something. But that seemed so unusual… I’d never heard anything about deer attacking people before. Especially not in my area.  \n\n\nI went over to Sasha’s house on the day before New Years. We’d both gotten some gift cards for Christmas and we were planning to walk to the mall together to use them. Her parents weren’t home, they both had to work. So it was just us when I got there.\n\n  “Hey! Kept me waiting!” She said when I knocked on the door.   \n   “Sorry.”   \n   “It’s fine. I’ll be ready in a bit. Come on upstairs, I wanna show you something!”\n\nI didn’t question what it was. I figured it was just something else she’d gotten for Christmas, so I went upstairs with her.\n\n  “You’re gonna love it.” She promised me, “It’s gonna be so funny…”\n\nShe led me to her bedroom, and as soon as she opened the door, I spotted a familiar notebook on her desk.  \n   “Where did you get this?” I asked, walking closer to it.\n\n  “Spacegirl dropped it when Brian and his Brother pulled that prank the other day, she dropped it. I may have grabbed it… Y’know. Just for safekeeping.”  \n\n\nShe cracked a wry grin, before opening the notebook.  \n\n\n  “Look at this… She’s been drawing the same damn Unicorns forever. She didn’t even finish this one!”\n\nShe paused at one small picture that was labeled ‘The Unicorn Prince’. It depicted an empty field with a blank space where the titular Prince should have been. Sasha flipped through the pages a little more until she got to the newer ones.\n\n  \n  “I figured since they kicked Spacegirl out for a little while, and her Mom is too poor to get her anything for the holidays, I’d step up! What do you think?” Sasha wasn’t anywhere near as good of an artist as Spacegirl was, but the simple detail in what she had drawn turned my stomach.\n\n  \nIn her first picture, Spacegirl was hanging from a rope. Her tongue was hanging out, and her eyes were closed.   \nIn the second one, Spacegirl had a gun in her mouth.   \nIn the third one, she was standing on the edge of a building. \n\nSasha giggled as I flipped through her crude depictions of suicide. There were pages of them.\n\n  “What do you think?” She asked with a grin, “I’ll bet she’ll lose her shit!”\n\nI closed the notebook and looked over at Sasha.\n\n  “A-are you out of your mind?” I asked. Sasha’s grin faded.\n\n  “What do you mean?”\n\n  “You stole her notebook, just so you could draw these? Sasha, that’s really messed up!”  \n   “It’s Spacegirl, who the hell cares about Spacegirl, Jane?”\n\n  “You just… drew her killing herself over and over again!” I took the book off her desk, “Do you not understand what’s wrong with that?”\n\nSasha just stared at me like I was crazy.\n\n  “Fine. Sue me for trying to be funny.” Sasha said, “Just give it here…” She outstretched a hand to take the notebook, but I pulled back from her. \n\n  “No. You’re just going to put something else in there.”\n\nAnger flared in Sasha’s eyes.\n\n  “Jane, just give me the book.”\n\n  “No!”  \n\n\nI opened the book, and I started to tear out those pages of Spacegirls suicide. Sasha lunged for me, trying to grab at the book and stop me, but  pushed her back. I didn’t mean to push so hard, but I did and she fell, landing hard on the ground. For a moment, Sasha looked up at me, wide eyed and shocked. I don’t think anyone had laid a hand on her like that before. Then I saw something in her eyes… Not just anger. Something worse. It was the same thing that had prompted her to draw those horrible pictures of Spacegirl. I turned and I ran, bolting down her stairs and out her front door, back into the snow. I clutched Spacegirls notebook to my chest the entire time and I didn’t let it go until I got home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI spent the rest of the Christmas break terrified that my parents would get a call from Sasha’s. I’d pushed her, and that seemed like such a big deal at the time. In hindsight, I doubt Sasha would have told her parents what had happened. They would have asked why I’d pushed her, and I would have told them about the notebook. On some level, she must have known that what she’d done was wrong. She was a cruel person, but there was a limit. Part of me hoped that she’d realize that I was right and we could patch things up when School started again, but honestly I wasn’t so sure.   \n\n\nI remember looking through Spacegirls drawings. The ones that she’d done. I remembered the ones I’d made fun of the most. There was one with a mermaid on a rock, combing her hair. Her eyes were closed in a relaxed bliss. I remembered saying how stupid her facial expression had looked, but honestly, I kinda liked it. I flipped through the pages some more, through Unicorns, Fairies and Castles. But I paused at the page depicting the Unicorn Prince. Back at Sasha’s place, it had been blank, but at my house it was finished. The Unicorn Prince stood proudly in his field, looking skywards with his horn proudly displayed. Maybe I had been thinking of a different picture?  \n\n\nI brushed it off and flipped to the back where Sasha’s pictures were. One by one, I started tearing them out of the notebook and tossing them in the trash. It was a waste of paper, but I refused to give it back to Spacegirl with those images still in it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the first day back to school, I was up early. I made sure the notebook was packed into my bag and was out as early as I could be. The snow on the ground was almost pristine as I walked to school, but I remember seeing some tracks on my lawn, headed down the side of my house. Deep U shaped indents that looked like they’d been made by hooves. A deer perhaps? I didn’t dwell on them and made my way down the freshly shoveled sidewalk and back to school.   \n\n\nI wasn’t entirely sure if Spacegirl would be back yet, but she was. She was alone in the classroom, sitting at her desk and drawing in a brand new notebook. She paused briefly when I walked in to join her, and I could see her sideying me. She didn’t say a word as I drew nearer, but I thought I saw her shoulders tense up ever so slightly.\n\n  “Hey.” I said, “I’m… I hope you had a nice Holiday.”\n\nShe didn’t respond.\n\n  “I’m sorry about what happened the other day. I didn’t know anything about it, but it just seemed really mean spirited.”\n\nStill no answer. I reached into my backpack, taking out her old notebook. I put it on her desk in front of her. She stared at it, still silent, then back at me.\n\n  “Sasha took it. I was over at her house the other day and she showed it to me. I had to take some pages out, but she drew some really awful things in there. I didn’t think it would be right to give it back with those things in there…” I paused, feeling smaller as Spacegirl stared at me. She didn’t seem angry or thankful. She didn’t seem anything at all. Just stoic.\n\n  “I’m sorry if I wasn’t all that great to you before.” I said, and then I shuffled off to by desk. Spacegirl waited until I sat down before she opened her notebook and inspected it. Then she closed her new book, and started something new on a fresh page in her old one. \n\nIt wasn’t much. But it made me feel at least a little good for what I’d done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen Sasha got in, she didn’t talk to me. She didn’t even look at me. Neither did Tanya or any of our other mutual friends. I knew from the moment they walked in that I’d burned my bridges with them. But I still wanted to try.\n\nThe Teacher hadn’t come in yet, so I figured it might be worth it to try and talk to Sasha. I got up to move closer to her and she gave me a look of utter disgust.  \n\n\n  “What do you want?” She spat. \n\nNow it was my turn to be silent.  \n\n\n  “Fuck off and leave us alone.” Tanya said, “You’d obviously rather hang out with the fucking retard than us, and I really don’t want you spreading your retard germs to us. It’s a quarantine issue.”   \n\n\nI stared at both of them, and I could’ve sworn I knew how Spacegirl felt… What was I supposed to say to any of that? Instead, I just returned to my desk without a word. Spacegirl stared at me the entire time. Her pencil rested over her notebook, but she didn’t write anything. She set it down, tore out the page she’d been writing on and jammed it into her pocket. I later saw her toss it into the trash during lunch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn’t really have anyone left… So I thought that maybe it might be a good idea to pull it out. Maybe it was something she wasn’t happy with? I’d never seen her throw a drawing out before. I was thinking that maybe I could use it as a peace offering of sorts, or something along those lines. When I saw what she’d written on it, I almost threw it back into the trash.   \n\n\n**Your Words**\n\n*There is a land where your sorry may go.*\n\n*A sickening land where it always snows*\n\n*The snow is putrid in color and smell*\n\n*It's substance- filth and things I won't tell.*\n\n*Only your Father has been there before.*\n\n*One day your boyfriend will visit once more.*\n\n*This place in your carcass this humanoid hell.*\n\n*Your sorry can go there to this hole in your shell*\n\n*My unsubtle message, this subtextual jazz.*\n\n*Is take your apology and stuff it up your ass.*  \n\n\nThis was unlike anything I’d ever seen her write. It was so crass and spiteful… This was as close to hatred as she could have gotten. I understood why she’d thrown it out. It didn’t fit with everything else she’d done. Those things had been beautiful, despite what people had said to her. This was angry and ugly… This was something she’d written for me. I put it in my pocket. I wasn’t going to give it back to her, but I wanted to keep it. I wanted to remember the way I’d made her feel. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEighth grade wasn’t fun for me. \n\nI had very few friends left, and Sasha never forgave me for turning on her. Her version of the story was slowly warped as time went on. First I’d punched her and stolen the book. Then I’d tried to kiss her, punched her when she’d refused, then stole the book to try and get her in trouble. Rumors of me being a dyke spread pretty quickly, and hot on their heels came the rumors that I was dating Spacegirl. I tried not to let them bother me too much. I knew the truth and at the end of the day, I’d done the right thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy the time High School rolled around, I was hoping for a fresh start. There were new faces, and I figured I could make friends with them before Sashas rumors spread. I had a bit of success in that department. I fell in with a better crowd at least.   \n\n\nSasha stuck with her same old clique. It grew ever so slightly, but she was determined to live out the movie Mean Girls and most people didn’t pay her any mind.   \nSpacegirl barely changed at all. I didn’t see her much when High School started. She was in a few of my classes, but I rarely saw her outside of them. Whenever she had a moment, she’d be in the library, usually in one of the corner cubicles, working on her drawings. Sometimes I thought about talking to her and trying to strike up a friendship… but it never felt right.   \n\n\nSasha’s bullying never let up of course. Of course she stalked Spacegirl to the library where she’d pull the same old shit she’d been pulling since the fifth grade. She’d leer over her cubicle and comment on her drawings. Picking them apart just like she always had. I stopped her whenever I saw it… but I didn’t always see it.\n\n  “Coming to her rescue again, huh Jane?” Sasha asked once when I’d interrupted her. Tanya leered at me from behind her, chewing gum with her mouth open. \n\n  “What’s she ever done to you anyways?” I asked, “She’s just minding her own business.”\n\n  “Oh? What’s she done to you, dyke?” Sasha hissed. She leaned down over her cubicle and looked down at the notebook.\n\n  “Unicorns… Unicorns, unicorns, fucking unicorns… When are you going to grow up Spacegirl?”  \n   “Hey! I told you to stop.” I rounded the cubicle and I saw Sasha recoil. For a moment, I saw a bit of fear in her eyes. It vanished quickly and was replaced with a familiar rage.  \n\n\n  “Fine.” She said, “Tan, let’s leave the happy couple to their alone time.”  \nShe pulled away from the cubicle and disappeared with Tanya nipping at her heels like a faithful terrier. \n\nSpacegirl remained hunched over her notebook, her long red hair spilling over her shoulders. She seemed impossibly still.\n\nI turned to leave her when I heard:\n\n  “Thanks.”\n\nI looked back at her and saw that she was looking at me.\n\n  “Um… You’re welcome.” I said, “Let me know if she bothers you again, alright?”\n\n  “I will. But… you’re usually there anyways.” \n\nHer voice was soft and low. I’d heard it before, but I don’t remember her ever speaking directly to me.\n\n  “Yeah, well. It’s just not right. She’s such a child. One of these days she’s going to have to grow up.”\n\nSpacegirl just nodded, looking over towards the library door, then back down at her notebook again. \n\nFor a moment, I thought about asking her about what she was drawing. I thought about saying something else, but… No. I didn’t want to make her uncomfortable. I left her alone again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn tenth grade, I took art as an elective. I wasn’t much of an artist, but I figured it would be an easy course. To the surprise of no one, Spacegirl was there. I actually asked her to work with me on a few group projects. I think the prospect of being asked to work together was foreign to her. She looked at me suspiciously when I did it, but when she smiled, it was the biggest smile I’d ever seen.  \n\n\nI went to her house for the first time to work on a portrait project with her once. We were supposed to take turns drawing portraits of each other and I’d volunteered to let her draw me first. Rumors of her Mother had always surrounded Spacegirl, so I wasn’t entirely sure what to expect when I got there. I certainly wasn’t expecting the quiet, neatly kept house that I found.  \n\n\nThe Woman who answered the door looked like an older version of her daughter, sans the coke bottle glasses.\n\n  “You must be Jane.” She said. She wasn’t smiling, but she didn’t sound upset either.\n\n  “Yes ma’am…”\n\n  “Come on in. Megan's upstairs. She was just getting ready for you.”\n\nThe house was warm with plenty of knick knacks on the walls. Plates and porcelain dolls mostly. Her Mom sent me upstairs and I didn't waste any time. On the landing leading up to Spacegirls room, I could see a mural of family photos and paused to look at them. I could recognize Spacegirl and her Mother in most of them. Spacegirl never seemed to be smiling. I only saw her Father in a few of the very early pictures. Spacegirl looked like she was only a young child in the few pictures I saw him in though. I didn’t dwell for long and headed towards what I assumed was her room. The cardboard stars and planets on it gave it away.  \n\n\nSure enough, she was inside waiting for me. She sat facing the door behind an easel in the center of her room. Her bed was neatly made and tucked away in the corner. She had a clean little desk that she’d clearly been working on and had set a chair out for me to sit on. I hadn’t expected something so overwhelmingly formal and I almost started laughing… But then I noticed her walls.  \n\n\nThey weren’t just covered in drawings. The art pieces on them were full on paintings. They were the same fantasy depictions she usually did, but the colors were so vivid. The clouds looked like fluffy pillows and the castles seemed great and infinite.\n\n  “Holy shit, are these yours?”\n\n  “They are.” Spacegirl said softly. She stood up and took the plate of cookies from me, then moved it to her desk.\n\n  “It… it’s soothing.” She said after a while, “Painting, I mean. I pick the drawings I like the most and… I finish them.”\n\nShe spoke slowly, like she was carefully choosing her words. I almost felt like there was something that she was trying to avoid. I spotted a painting on the floor that looked like her Father. The style was the same but the content was different. He was surrounded by awkward scribbles, and he looked completely and utterly terrified. Spacegirl looked down at it, but she seemed to disapprove of it. She turned it around so I wouldn’t have to look at it.  \n\n\n  “We should get started.” She said, “Sorry…”\n\n  “No, it’s alright!” I said. I sat in the chair for her. “I’d like to hear about it.”\n\nSpacegirl watched me from the corner of her eye for a moment, as if she doubted I was being serious. But eventually she sat down behind the easel and started to draw… Soon after that, she was talking too. I stayed long after she’d gotten what she needed for her sketch, just to talk. She told me that she’d always liked fantasy, and how she liked Unicorns because they were simple but pretty. I hung on to every word, and I could’ve sworn I saw her smiling shyly as she talked.   \n\n\nThe portrait she’d done of me was something else entirely. Her work had always been beautiful… but this made me look transcendent. I wasn’t entirely sure that I was looking at myself at first. There was something about the look on my face. There was a small, almost content smile there. The warmth it conveyed was almost disney-esque.\n\n  “I love it.” I told her, “That’s incredible Spa… Megan… That’s really great!”\n\n  “You can call me Spacegirl if you want.” She said, “I don’t mind the nickname… Not as much as I mind the people at least.”\n\nMy awe quickly turned to shame, but Spacegirl didn’t look upset… She just stared at me blankly like she so often did. No… not blankly. Her face might not have conveyed much emotion, but there was definitely some emotion there. \n\n  “I wish… I wish I’d been nicer to you, when we were younger.” I said.\n\n  “Is that why you’re here right now?” Spacegirl asked.\n\n  “No! I… I’m here for the assignment. I mean… the art assignment. The portraits…” \n\nShe continued to stare. \n\n  “Did you pick me because you felt bad for me?” She asked. \n\n  “No! I just thought it would be cool to work with you.”\n\nSpacegirl didn't react for a moment, but then she just nodded. \n\n  “Okay.” Her flat tone made it hard to know what she meant by that. She stood up and walked over to the portrait. \n\n  “Mom can drive you home if you need a ride.” She said. I opened my mouth to say something else. I wanted to apologize, but I didn’t know what.Had I offended her? Had I said something wrong?\n\n  “Alright. Thanks.” It was the only thing I could think of. “See you tomorrow.”\n\nWith that, I left her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was almost afraid to see Spacegirl the next morning. I drifted through my classes that day until I reached art… and when I did, I wasn’t expecting what I saw. She had clearly been up late… but what she’d brought in stole my breath away.  \n\n\nIt was my portrait, but she’d done more with it than I thought possible. She’d painted over the sketch, turning me into something beautiful. Flowers bloomed around my brown hair and a crown of daisies, lilies and chrysanthemums adorned my head. The colors were so vivid, and I looked so at peace in it. Spacegirl was looking right at me as I came in, as if she was gauging my reaction. But all I could do was stare wide eyed and in awe. When I looked back at Spacegirl, she was smiling at me. Her project single handedly netted us an A on the project and got the privilege of being hung up outside of the art classroom. Of course I told her how much I loved it, and I remember the way she smiled when I did. I remember thinking that it was the cutest smile I'd ever seen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy portrait was up for barely even a day before Sasha had to make a comment. I’d been on my lunch, and had just gotten some fries from the cafeteria when she and Tanya ambushed me.\n\n  “Where’s your flower crown, dyke.” Sasha said, \n\n  “Leave me alone.” I said, brushing past them, but Sasha was out for blood.\n\n  “I always knew you were a little dyke. But now you’ve posted solid proof of it! We’ve gone and cracked the case, haven’t we? So what happened? Did you go to her house and lick her retarded little snatch? You must be a real good dyke because she went and drew that for you!”\n\nI tried to walk away from her, but Sasha and Tanya just kept following me.\n\n  “What’s wrong? Am I not pretty enough for you Dyke?” She snapped at me.\n\n  “Maybe she only fucks retarded girls.” Tanya said, “I’ll bet Spacegirl squealed like a pig when she came.”\n\nI stopped dead in my tracks, and I heard Sasha stop behind me. I don’t know what it was about what she’d said that pissed me off so much. But those two had finally struck a nerve. I spun around, swinging my lunch tray as hard as I could. Fries were scattered everywhere, but although I was aiming for Tanya, I hit Sasha. She went down hard, and I’m not sure if she was even still conscious when she hit the ground. Tanya was on me in an instant. She slammed me back against a wall, and kept me pinned. She had size and strength on me, and there wasn’t a thing I could do to stop her. Several other students grabbed at us. A teacher finally got involved and all three of us got escorted to see the Principal. As we left the cafeteria, I saw Spacegirl in one of the halls, just staring at me.   \n\n\nNaturally I got a three day suspension, but Tanya and Sasha were fine. Both of them said they’d just been walking and I attacked unprovoked. It was their word against mine. Sasha had a familiar shit eating grin on as she left the office with only a bruise on her forehead to show for her troubles, but there was a familiar look in her eyes. That same anger I’d seen last time I’d laid a hand on her… and something about it scared me.  \n\n\nWhen I came back to school, I realized that I had every reason to be afraid. My portrait was missing. I wondered if they’d taken it down because I’d attacked Sasha, but the truth was a lot worse.\n\n  “Someone took it.” Spacegirl said. She was sitting in her usual spot in the library when I found her, sketching flowers in her notebook.\n\n  “When?”  \n   “The day after you hit Sasha… I don’t think anyone’s found it yet.”\n\nShe didn’t look up at me. Just stayed focused on her art. She didn’t need to say it for me to know who she blamed. Who else would it be? I had half a mind to confront Sasha about it, but I didn’t know if that would be a good idea or not. Sasha could easily just cry wolf. I wouldn’t put it past her. In the end, it didn't matter.  \n\n\nBy the time I was headed to art class, the painting was back. But there had been some modifications made to it.\n\nThe words:\n\n***Retard Fucking Dyke***\n\nHad been painted across my portrait in bright red. I saw it from down the hall and could see some other students whispering amongst themselves beneath it. I didn’t know what to say or do… But this felt like too much.  \n\n\nThe picture was taken down quickly… but the damage was done. Sasha had gotten her revenge, and it didn’t stop with just the painting. Spacegirl looked different than when I’d seen her in the library. She seemed uneasy, and her eyes were red like she’d been crying.\n\n  “I’m sorry about the painting…” I said softly. She looked at me, before sighing.\n\n  “I knew she’d do something like that…” She said, “I’m so used to it by now, that it doesn’t bother me anymore. I’m sorry she wrote those things about you, though.”\n\n  “But you worked hard on that.” I said, “I’d be upset too.”\n\nShe just shook her head.\n\n  “That’s not it.” She said. She reached into her pocket, pulling out a crumpled up piece of paper then slid it over to me. \n\nSlowly I uncrumpled the paper, and my eyes widened as I recognized what was on it.\n\nIt wasn’t the same drawing… but it was close enough. It was a depiction of Spacegirl hanging herself, and me beside her. A caption read ‘*Retard Dyke Wedding’.*\n\n  “There were so many in my locker…” Spacegirl said.\n\n  “This is what she drew in your notebook… when I returned it to you… This is what I had to take out.”\n\nSpacegirl looked down at the picture again, before averting her eyes. She didn’t pay much attention during class. Instead of taking notes, she sketched in her notebook. I looked over a few times to see her drawing another Unicorn. This one seemed so similar to the one I’d seen before. She must not have been quite happy with it though… When I looked back at her notebook, the Unicorn wasn’t there anymore. She must have just erased it… but it seemed so clean. Like it hadn’t been erased at all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTanya was following me on my walk home that evening. I didn’t know what she had in mind, but I didn’t want to put up with it. When I was in the middle of a small walking path that cut behind some of the houses on my street, I stopped and looked at Tanya as she kept approaching.\n\n  “What do you want?” I asked.\n\n  “It’s a surprise.” She said, “Sasha and I just want you to know how much we love Dykes in this town… Oops, I’ve said too much.”\n\nI wanted to hit her. Dear God I just wanted to hit her, but we both knew she could overpower me. Whatever Tanya had in mind… it wasn’t anything good. She drew closer to me, unafraid of anything I’d do.\n\n  “Come on, Dyke. Go home.” She said. “Let’s go check out your surprise.”\n\nIn a sudden horrible moment, I realized that Tanya was threatening me. I also realized that I couldn’t outrun her… I couldn’t fight her off. I didn’t really have much of a choice but to do as she asked. Slowly, I turned and walked towards my house, with Tanya at my heels. It wasn’t far, and up ahead I could see Sasha sitting on a park bench. From a distance, I recognized the red gas can beside her, and I stopped dead in my tracks.\n\nTanya seized me by the arm and pulled me towards the bench. Sasha just watched with a wide, manic grin.\n\n  “Hey Jane.” She said, “How’s it going?”\n\n  “What the fuck is this?!”\n\n  “Just wanted to chat.” Sasha said with a cold chuckle, “You think you can get away with pulling the shit you did the other day. No. You’ve been treating me like garbage for years, and for what? Because of Spacegirl? You know who you’re fucking choosing, right? Right? God… I hate that retard girl. But you know what? I hate you even more. Acting like you’re better than me just because you feel bad for her.”\n\n  “You’re crazy.” \n\nSasha just laughed.\n\n  “I’m not the one who clocked someone with a fucking tray just for a little bit of teasing. You’re absolutely fucking psycho!”\n\nOn the bench behind her, I saw the portrait that Spacegirl had painted of me. Sasha picked it up and tossed it in front of me, then picked up the gas can and dumped it onto the canvas.\n\n  “You wanna be a Dyke, I don’t care. But I’m not letting you and your retarded whore put your shit up! So say goodbye to your little project, slut!”\n\nSasha reached into her pocket and took out a book of matches. Her grin widened, before suddenly vanishing outright as she looked at something behind us.   \n   “What the hell?” Tanya said, and I craned my neck to try and see what they were seeing. As for believing it… that was another story entirely.  \n\n\nStanding on the path behind us was a Unicorn… but the way it looked was all wrong. This was nothing like a regular horse. Its body was plain white and almost textureless save for the many thin blue lines that ran along its body. It looked like it had been cut out from a sheet of lined paper but… that was impossible… It had to be impossible. Neatly done grey lines defined the shape of the horse. In fact, the lines reminded me of the ones Spacegirl used. This Unicorn looked like it had walked out of one of her notebooks!\n\nTanya let me go and stumbled back a few steps, wide eyed as she stared at the advancing Unicorn. It let out an angry noise before charging straight for Tanya. She panicked and tried to run. In her desperation to escape, she bolted down the path. But she couldn’t outrun the paper Unicorn. It lowered its head as it drew nearer to her, and in one swift movement, the horn pierced Tanya’s back, impaling her straight through the chest. She screamed as she was hoisted off the ground and the Unicorn circled back to fix Sasha in a murderous glare.   \n\n\nTanya looked down at the massive spike sticking out of her, her eyes clearly wide with horror and her body twitching its last spasms as the life quickly drained from her. The Unicorn lowered its head to let her slide off of its horn and she hit the ground in a bundle of limbs.  \n\n\nSasha and I stared in silent horror as the Unicorn reared up on its hind legs and brought its hooves down upon Tanya’s body. She didn’t scream. She didn’t fight. She simply lay there as she was trampled again and again. I can only hope she died quickly.  \n\n\nSasha dropped the unlit match and took a slow, terrified step back before toppling over. I stumbled back and looked down to see the portrait of me at her feet. But it had changed. That beautifully painted version of me was now leaning out of the canvas, invading the real world and clutching Sasha’s leg tightly.\n\nStill with that look of contentment on her face, I watched as the Painted Me slowly slipped back into her panting, and she took Sasha’s leg with her.\n\n  “FUCK, FUCK, FUCK!”\n\nSasha desperately swatted at the Painted Me, but she couldn’t overpower it. She couldn’t escape. Her nails tried to dig into the pavement as she was slowly dragged into the canvas. She looked at me in horror, silently begging for help but all I could do was stare back at her in silence.\n\n  “JANE! JANE HELP! PLEASE! PLEASE!\"\n\nThe hands of the Painted Me reached up, seizing Sasha by the hair and forcing her down into the canvas. It was like watching something pull her underwater. One minute she was there, the next she was gone. I stood silent in the park, staring at the painting, then at the paper Unicorn. The Unicorn huffed before retreating off into the woods and then I was alone.  \n\n\nSlowly, I approached the painting and I looked down at it. It had changed and now it depicted Sasha, her mouth open in a horrified final scream. After some hesitation, I picked up the painting. I could return it to Spacegirl in the morning. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey chalked Tanya’s death up to an animal attack, and nobody ever found Sasha. I never asked Spacegirl about what I saw. I don’t think even she knew the answer, although she certainly knew much more than I did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHigh School was ten years ago though, and I’ve chosen not to remember as much as I can. I’ve got my own life to live now and I try not to ask so many questions. Sometimes I see paintings move, but I don’t bother with a second glance and I never ask my wife about them. She doesn’t like to talk about it and I won’t ever force her. The painting of Sasha hangs in her studio at home, right beside the painting of her Father. Sometimes I look at it and I wonder if maybe things could have been different… but I don’t feel too guilty about it. I wouldn’t feel too guilty if I heard another story about a suspicious trampling or animal attack either but to my knowledge, there’s been nothing of the sort. I guess I shouldn’t be too surprised. I do my best to make sure nobody hurts my beautiful Spacegirl."},"210":{"title":"Something happened 63 years ago that's haunted me my entire life.

Today is my 75th birthday, and God, the years do fly.\n\nI’m not here for your well wishes; this is hardly a milestone I’m excited about. I’m glad to still be here, of course, but I find I have less and less to live for with every passing year. My bones ache, my kids live far away, and the other side of my bed has been empty for just over eight months now. In fact, once I cast my vote against that goddamned Trump this November, I may have nothing to live for at all.\n\nSo spare me your “happy birthdays” and your congratulations, if you please. I’m here because I have a story for you, and it’s one I’ve never told before. I used to think I kept it inside because it was silly, or maybe because nobody would believe it. I’ve found, though, that the older you grow, the more exhausting it becomes to lie to yourself. If I’m being perfectly honest, I’ve never told anybody this story because it scares me, almost to death. \n\nBut death seems friendlier than it used to, so listen close.\n\n*****\n\nThe year was 1950; the setting a small town in Maine. I was a boy of nine, rather small for my age, with only one friend in the world to speak of—and his family, seemingly on a whim, decided to move 2,000 miles away. It was shaping up to be the worst summer of my life.\n\nMy pop wasn’t around and my mom was a chore-whore—boy, was I proud of myself when I came up with that one—so I wasn’t apt to hang around the house. With some hesitation, I decided the public library was the place to be that summer. The library’s collection of books, particularly children’s books, was meager to say the least. But within the walls of that miserly structure, I would find no undone chores, no nagging mother (God rest her soul), and perhaps most importantly, no other children with whom I would be expected to associate. I was the only kid with a low enough social status to spend his precious days of freedom sulking amid the bookshelves, and that was just fine with me.\n\nThe first half of my summer was even more dreadful than I had imagined it would be. I would sleep in until 10, do my chores, and then ride my bike to the library (and by bike, I mean rusty log of shit attached to a pair of wheels). Once there, I would split my time between unintentionally annoying the elderly patrons and deliberately doing so. One pleasant lady actually interrupted my incessant tongue-clicking to hiss a “shut the fuck up!” at me—the first time I ever heard a grownup use The F Word. Big fuckin’ deal, I know, but in those days it was unheard of.\n\nThe dreary days turned to woeful weeks. I had actually begun praying for school to start again—until I discovered the basement. I could have sworn I’d roamed every inch of that library, but one day, in the far corner behind the foreign language collection I stumbled across a small wooden door I had never seen before. That was where it all began.\n\nThe door was windowless and made from oak that looked far older than the wall in which it rested. It had a knob of black metal that quite literally looked ancient—I wouldn’t have been surprised to learn it was crafted in the 17th century. Engraved on the knob was what appeared to be a single footprint. I had the sense that whatever lay beyond this door was forbidden to me, and therefore probably the most interesting thing I would encounter all summer. I quickly glanced around to make sure nobody was watching me, then turned the heavy knob, slipped behind the door, and shut it.\n\nThere was nothing; only darkness. I took a couple of steps and then stopped, unnerved by the totality of the shadow which surrounded me. I waved my hands in front of me in an attempt to find a wall or a shelf or anything to hold on to. What I actually found was far more subtle—a small string, dangling from above—but far more useful. I grabbed it firmly and pulled it down.\n\nBack in the day, lots of lightbulbs were operated with strings, and this was one of them. My surroundings were instantly illuminated. I was standing on a small, dusty platform that looked as though it hadn’t seen life in quite some time. To my left was a crickety-ass spiral staircase, made of wood and appearing ready to collapse at any second. The bulb was the only source of light in the room, and it was feeble, so when I peered over the railing to see what lay below, the bottom of the staircase dissolved into the darkness.\n\nI was beginning to feel scared. This place—wherever I was—seemed to have no business in a town library. It was as though I were in a completely different building. But no nine-year-old likes to let a mystery go unsolved. Looking back, I wish I could tell my prepubescent self to turn around, go back, do anything else besides descending that staircase. “You’ll be spared a lot of sleepless nights,” I’d say. But, of course, I didn’t know that then—and I may not have listened even if I had. So instead of turning back, I took a deep breath, gripped the railing, and glared resolutely forward as I began my descent.\n\nThe wood on the railing was dry and covered with splinters. I immediately let go, holding my hands out for balance as I carefully traversed the staircase. It was (or at least seemed) very long, and with only the dim glow from the string-bulb far above me, my heart pounded mercilessly in the darkness. Even kids can sense when something isn’t right, I think—they just don’t always give a shit.\n\nBy the time my feet reached the cement floor at the bottom, the light from the bulb above was very nearly a memory. But there was a new light source, and God, I’ll never forget it. Directly in front of me was a door, massive, and a deep shade of red. The light was coming from behind the door, and it shone out in thin lines from all four sides—a sinister, dimly glowing rectangle. For the second time, I took a deep breath and went through a door I shouldn’t have.\n\nIn contrast to the dank room I entered from, the room behind the door was blinding. When my eyes adjusted, what I saw nearly took my breath away. \n\nIt was a library. The most perfect library imaginable.\n\nI gaped in wonder as I stepped, almost reverently, further into the room. It was beautiful. It was smaller than the library above, much smaller, but it seemed to be almost tailor-made for me. The shelves were packed with brightly colored titles, both armchairs in the middle of the room were exquisitely comfortable, and the smell—my God, the smell—was simply unbelievable. Sort of a mixture of citrus and pine. I simply can’t do it justice with words, so I’ll suffice it to say that I’ve never smelled anything better. Not in my 75 years.\n\nWhat was this room? Why had I never heard of it before? Why was nobody else here? Those were the questions I should have been asking. But I was intoxicated. As I gazed around at all the books and basked in the smell of paradise, I could only form one thought: *I will never be bored again.* \n\n*****\n\nIn truth, boredom only hid from me for three years. It was on my 12th birthday, 63 years ago to this day, that everything changed.\n\nBefore that day, I visited my basement sanctuary as often as I could—usually several times a week. I never saw another soul down there, yet strangely remained free of suspicion. I never removed a book from that room, but instead would pick up a particular volume wherever I had stopped reading during my previous visit. I sat, always in the same deep purple armchair, and always leaving its twin barren and directly across from myself. That armchair was mine, the other was—well, I suppose I couldn’t have articulated it then much better than I can now. But it wasn’t mine, that’s for damn sure.\n\nOn my twelfth birthday, I arrived later than usual. My mom had invited a couple classmates and some cousins over to our house to celebrate, a gesture which I found more tedious than touching—really, I just wanted to spend my birthday sitting and reading and smelling paradise. Eventually, our guests went home, and I made it to the library about fifteen minutes before closing time. That didn’t matter; the workers never checked down there before they locked up. I was free to stay as late as I wished. This particular night, I was devouring the final chapters of an epic adventure; knights, swords, dragons, and the like. I didn’t smell it until I read the final words and closed the book.\n\nThe once exquisite aroma of that room had turned sour. I sat for a moment, unsettled. Objectively, I could recognize that the smell was actually the same as it had been before—that mixture of citrus and pine. I just perceived it differently, and I didn’t like it anymore. It was the nasal version of an optical illusion; you know, the one that looks like a young woman glancing backward, but all of a sudden you see that it’s really an old woman facing toward you? You can’t unsee that, and I couldn’t unsmell this. The spell was broken.\n\nThe odor also seemed, for the first time, to be coming from somewhere specific. With a fair amount of trepidation, I stalked around the room, sniffing the air like a crazed canine until I came to a shelf near the back. The shelf was perfectly normal, with the exception of one title—a large, leatherbound cover of solid faded maroon, with one striking black footprint at the top of the spine. This was the source of the smell. I opened the front cover, and saw one sentence scrawled neatly in blood-red ink atop the first page: \n\n*Rest your sorrows down, friend, and leave them where they lie.*\n\nI stared at this sentence, mesmerized, as I began to retreat to my chair. I turned a page. Blank. The smell became stronger. Another page, blank, and the smell grew stronger still. I stopped for a moment, suppressed a gag, and continued walking. Then, as I neared the armchairs, I turned one final page—and there, in the same sinister print, was the last thing I expected to see: my own name. I dropped the book. I began to sprint toward the door, but as I shifted my gaze forward, my heart leapt to my throat and I stopped in my tracks.\n\nThe empty chair wasn’t empty anymore.\n\nAn aged man in a suit sat before me, one leg crossed over the other, contemplating me with piercing gray eyes and a light smirk. This was all too much. I fell to my knees and expelled the contents of my stomach onto the carpet. I wiped my mouth, staring at my vomit, when I heard the man let out a chuckle.\n\nI stared at him disbelievingly. “Who are you?” I asked, panic in my voice.\n\nThe man leapt to his feet, grabbed me gently by the shoulders, and helped me to my chair. He sat, once again, in his own. “I fear we got off to a bad start,” he said, glancing at the pile of sick on the carpet. “The smell . . . it does take some getting used to.”\n\n“Who are you?” I repeated.\n\n“Tonight, you will know hardship like you’ve never before known,” he said. “I come as a friend, offering you refuge from it, and from all other storms which lie ahead.”\n\nI wanted nothing more than to leave at that moment, but I remained seated. I asked him what he was talking about.\n\n“Your mother is dead, my boy. By her own hand, in her kitchen. The scene is gruesome, I must admit,” he said in sorrowful tones, but was there a playful glint in his eye? “Surely you wish to avoid this path. I can show you a safer one.”\n\nMy blood ran cold at the horrors this man spoke of, but I did not believe him. “What do you want with me?” I demanded, trying to sound braver than I felt. He laughed, an old, raspy yelp that seemed to shake him to his bones.\n\n“Nothing but your friendship, dear boy,” he said. Then, sensing I found his answer inadequate, he expounded. “I want you to come on a journey with me. My work is noble and you will make a fine apprentice. And maybe, when I’m done”—he sighed tiredly, running his bony fingers through his thin white hair—“maybe then, my work can be yours.”\n\nI stood up, shuffling toward the door but never breaking his gaze. “You’re crazy,” I told him. “My mom isn’t dead. She’s not.”\n\n“See for yourself, if you must,” he said, gesturing toward the door. I threw him a contemptuous glare and bolted for the exit. As my hand closed around the knob, he said my name softly. In spite of myself, I turned around.\n\n“Your road won’t be easy, friend. If it ever becomes too much for you, and I mean ever,” he said, pausing to sweep his hand over the room, “you know where to find me.”\n\nI slammed the door behind me and took the decrepit stairs two at a time. I exited the library, clambered onto my bike, and high-tailed it home. The front door was wide open. I dismounted, leaving my bike in a heap on the ground, and approached the house cautiously. The old man was lying—he must have been. Still, tears began to sting my eyes. Heart pounding, I stepped inside and called for my mother. I heard no answer, so I turned into the kitchen.\n\nTo this day, I don’t know why she did it.\n\n*****\n\nI’ve lived in that small town in Maine my entire life, although I’ve kept mostly clear of the public library. Once, in my late 20s, I summoned the courage to step inside. Life was good at that time, and my fear had begun to morph into idle curiosity. Where the door to my basement sanctuary once stood was only a blank wall. I asked the librarian what had become of that basement, though in my heart I knew the answer. There was no basement, she said. There had never been a basement. In fact, if she had her facts correctly, city zoning ordinances prohibited a basement in the area.\n\nI’ve been haunted by that sickly-sweet smell, that poisonous blend of citrus and pine, ever since that long ago birthday. When I saw my mother in the kitchen that day, collapsed in a pool of her own blood, I smelled it. When a man claiming to be my father knocked on my college apartment door, begged me for money and beat me to within an inch of my life when I refused, I smelled it. When my wife miscarried our second child, I smelled it, and again when she miscarried our fourth. When our oldest son got behind the wheel of the family Buick completely shitfaced and got his girlfriend killed, I smelled it.\n\nI began to smell it periodically as my wife became sick. She died late last year, and now, I’m alone for the first time in more than half a century. Now, I smell it every day, and it feels like an invitation.\n\nA few months ago, I went back to the library and the small oak door with the ancient handle was there—right where it used to be. My evening walk has brought me past that library every day since, but I haven’t gone inside. Maybe tonight I will. I’m frightened to die, yes, but lately I’m even more frightened to keep living. The old man was right—my road hasn’t been easy, and I doubt it will get any easier.\n\n*Rest your sorrows down, friend, and leave them where they lie.*\n\nHe promised relief. A refuge, he said. Was he right about that too? There’s only one way to find out. After all, I still know where to find him.\n\n-----------\n\n[x](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCNzHOZrXbYUdvJCRtfrBLmg)"},"211":{"title":"Don't let them in.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/bls5lo\/dont_let_them_in\/","flair":null,"author":"Coney-IslandQueen","selftext":" Addiction took our mother slowly, rocked her through it and sung her to sleep sunk deep into the mattress on her bed. When her back teeth fell out she left them on the side of the bathtub. I was seven, and I kept them in a match box, the missing pieces of her kept safe, so she wouldn't be lost forever. So maybe one day we could put her back together. Our house fell down around us, and we tried our best to raise ourselves. The ceilings had water damage and the bottom stairs had dry rot and in the winters the radiators would bleed rust. But it was still our house, and Annie made it a home.\n\nMy sister Annie mothered me, with lopsided bandaids on bruised knees and lukewarm microwave meals. She told me ghost stories and didn’t mind when I crawled into her bed later on, too scared to sleep alone. She taught me to dance, barefoot on the living room carpet, music channel on full volume on the TV shaking our hips before they were fully grown. She always let me shower first so the water was hot, never complaining when she had to make do with cold. She brushed my hair everyday before school, even when I screamed and hit her when she caught the tangles. Annie was dark haired like her father, whoever he had been, but I was blonde. Annie was desperate to be blonde too, like Marilyn Monroe. Like mom. I think she thought it would make them closer, remind mom less of her dad. I’d give anything for her to have her hands in my hair one more time, even if it hurt. She moved to New York when I turned eighteen and never came back. I still dream about her sometimes.\n\nKeeping up with our mother was impossible and we learnt from a young age we would always be left behind. It didn’t make it any easier. When she was drinking light, she shone, would wake us up at 3am with pancakes, dripping in cherry syrup. Sometimes when the weather was right and she’d had enough being drunk alone, she would call our school up and tell them we had both come down with summer sickness and we’d drive to the beach instead. I remember being nine years old in the backseat of the car coming home after one of our ocean days, sucking the salt from my fingers. Annie had just dyed her hair blonde, her best friend Jane helping her bend over our kitchen sink. From behind, I couldn’t tell who was mother and who was daughter, radio up and windows down blowing the sky inside.\n\nWhen she was drinking heavy, she’d be out all night, hair piled up like a beauty queen, eyes glazed over and ringed with glitter and black. Sometimes she’d be gone a day or two. She would never tell us when, one day we’d just wake up to an empty house and the fridge packed full, post it note on the front with a smear of moms lipstick in the outline of a kiss, telling us she’d be back soon. Sometimes she’d bring guys home, filling the table with beer cans and ash trays, smoke up to the ceiling, mom lost in the haze. We’d sleep with pillows over our heads, trying to drown out the music they would blast until the am, and wake up to strangers at our kitchen table in the morning, asking us where we kept the coffee. \n\nWhen mom drank too little she fell apart. She wouldn’t buy food, refrigerator a gaping hole in the wall. She’d chain smoke, leaving cigarette burns on the wallpaper up by the stairs like the walls were sick and decaying. She barely slept, walking around with blue half moons under her eyes, knuckles raw. She would scream at the slightest thing. I remember once when I spilled a glass of juice on the couch. She looked over at me with dead eyes and dragged me off onto the carpet and then took every single cushion off the couch and into the back yard and set them on fire. Annie went to watch a while from the window and then sat next to me on the floor, backs pressed against the skeleton of the seats, head resting in the crater of my collar bones. \n\nWhen mom drank too much was the worst. She’d laugh too loud and too long at anything and everything, until her mouth started to shake and she started crying, at the breakfast table into her cereal. Annie shut down when mom was like this, went somewhere deep inside herself where nobody could hurt her. She’d stay up until the morning watching old black and white movies on TV, whispering the lines she knew by heart like prayers. When I was five I’d cry when I’d find mom passed out cold on her bed, sure she would never wake up. Annie would wipe my tears, tell me she was only sleeping just like the princesses in my story book. We’d sit on moms bed together and wait for her to wake up. When we were older, I was the one who would pick mom up off the bathroom floor again and again and Annie would put her to bed, smoothing her hair off her face and the vomit from her mouth, changing her clothes if she’d pissed herself. Watching them then, there was no doubt that Annie was the mother now.\n\nIt was October and I was thirteen, Annie sixteen. It was a Wednesday night and mom had been gone for two days. She’d called us that morning from a pay phone, voice slurring down the line, telling us she was having the best time with all her new friends, hoped we were doing fine. When she asked me if I was having a good birthday I hung up on her. My birthday had been the day before. Annie had given me a pile of presents, strawberry lipglosses and glittery nail polishes. I didn’t ask where she’d got the money for them. I didn’t care. We’d taken the bus to the beach with Jane, eaten the birthday cake she had made for me, sand getting into the frosting. It tasted like sweetness and the sea, and I savoured every bite and scrape of sugar against my teeth. We watched the sun go down, Annie snapping grainy photos on her shitty Nokia as I blew out my candles, wishing over and over that mom wouldn't come home, that she’d just stay gone this time. \n\nBut that Wednesday night, me and Annie weren't speaking. Anger hung heavy between us, seeping through the floorboards. It began when she tripped at the bottom of the stairs. We’d both laughed, Annie throwing her head back, gap between her front teeth catching the light. When I’d bent to pick her up, I’d caught her breath, warm against the freckles on my cheeks. I let go of her arms and she fell again, hitting the floor and grinning, shaking her hair from her face. Her breath was heavy with whiskey. I couldn't start picking her up too, couldn't watch her fall again and again. Just like mom, I knew she’d never get back up. \n\nI’d stared down at her, blonde hair fallen into her eyes and all I could see was our mother, and then I was running, feet slamming the hallway like heartbeats turned loose. I’d run for the kitchen and tipped every bottle we had down the sink, shoving Annie back as she fought to stop me, catching liquor on her fingers as it fell. She grabbed my shoulders and made me drop the very last bottle. It smashed between us on the floor, glass shards shining like we’d dragged the stars out of the sky and broken them, pieces we could never put back. Outside through the open windows, the sky turned pale gold, clouds a mess of pink and cream smeared across the horizon. I cried then, watching Annie on her knees picking up the pieces. That was Annie, always trying to fix things even when it was too late. \n\nThe smell of food dragged me from my room, stomach turning traitor inside my ribcage. Annie was cooking pasta, real food not made in a microwave. She’d set the table, Tammy Wynette singing softly from the CD player, Annie gently swaying her hips as she stirred the tomato sauce, rich and warm. As we ate in silence, with every bite I forgave her. Mom never cooked dinner, or remembered my favourite was spaghetti ever since I was a kid, or stayed sober long enough to sit up at a table. Annie wasn’t mom.\n\nWe were washing the dishes when we first heard it. A moth was crawling down the inside of the pane and I cracked the window to let it out into the dark. From the backyard came a faint sound. I tilted my head to listen as it was coming from far off. Crying. I figured it was Mika the two year old next door having a tantrum loud enough for us to catch, or maybe even Lucky Strike the cat that junkies down the street, begging for food like he sometimes did. I always wanted to feed him when he came around, winding over my ankles, but Annie always stopped me, saying once you started giving they never stopped taking. Looking back, I don’t think she was talking about the cat.\n\nAnnie flipped the christmas lights strung up around the porch and we sat on the plastic beach chairs watching the skies. When we were little, we’d sit outside and Annie would tell me the names of all the constellations and the stories of how they came to be hung up in the night sky. I had to grow up before I realised she made them all up as she went along. It was a game we still liked to play now, making up ridiculous stories for the shapes we could pick out. \n\n“Ah, yes, that one there is the Coors Light. It got there when God dropped it out of his convertible window and never picked it up,” she said, nodding sagely and hiding her smile. \n\n“Of course,” I said, waving my hands and pointing up past the power lines. “Right next to The Ashtray, left there by angels on a smoke break.”   \n \n\n“Yeah, they say if you wish on it, all your dreams will come true,” said Annie grinning. \n\nShe stopped laughing, voice quieter, face tilted up to all those dead stars. \n\n“Let’s wish Emmy. Let’s wish” So we did.\n\nThe sound of crying interrupted us. It was closer this time, and definitely human. We turned to each other, confused. Annie shrugged and I squinted out into the black. It sounded like a baby, lost and tired and alone. \n\n“It must be Mika?” I said, slowly getting to my feet. “Maybe he walked around the back? Shit, do you want to call Connie and tell her we’ll bring him over.” Annie didn't reply, and I sighed, rolling my eyes. “Guess I’ll do everything then.” \n\nI stepped off the porch, grass soft against my heels. The air smelled like it might rain, fresh and clean and growing. A promise unfulfilled.  \n\n“Em.” Annie’s voice was strained. I turned to her, smiling. It died on my face when I saw the look on her own. “Em get inside now.” She was staring out into the dark, past me, opening the door with one hand behind her, fingers fumbling on the catch. I froze, bare foot in the dirt. I’d found what she was looking at. \n\nIn the bushes by the back fence was a person, crouched with their knees tucked up neat under the chin, arms wrapped around legs. Their mouth hung wide, softly opening and closing as he cried. Like a child, lost in the dark. Not like a child, but a someone pretending. Mimicking the sound, open and closed out in the blackness. Suddenly they straightened, snapping upright face still hidden by the black. They were tall and thin, too thin to be a normal person. \n\nPanic made me move, animal instincts leftover from the days we lived up in the trees carrying me forward. I was faster than Annie, dragging her inside and slamming the door behind us, hearing it bounce on its hinges as I locked it. We watched as the person slowly walked towards the house, steps deliberate and long. \n\nAnnie reached for my hand, holding me tight and turned me to face her, holding my shoulders. \n\n“Don’t turn around Emmy. Don’t turn around.” Instinctively I started to look over my shoulder out into the darkness. Annie grabbed my face, hard, and shook her head. I knew then she was serious.\n\n“I’m…” her voice cracked, and she cleared her throat, gripping my hand tight enough to hurt, nails digging in, grounding herself. I looked down at our fingers interlocked, both of us grown from the same bones. \n\n“I’m gonna call the cops and everything is going to be…” her voice faltered, stuttering. Tears spilled over her lashes, dripping like the promise of rain. Annie never cried. \n\n“Your phone’s on the porch,” she whispered, and bile crawled its way up my throat. Her phone was upstairs, charging. \n\nA soft, tap-tap-tapping filled the silence. Annie turned to the window, eye whites showing her eyes were so wide.\n\nIt was the sound of someone’s forehead against the glass, slowly, over and over. They started to speed up, faster and harder, skin meeting glass until they was slamming into the window hard enough to shake the panes. The tapping stopped and I was about to ask Annie if I could look now when she screamed, followed by the sound of cracking glass and the loudest slam yet. Whoever was in our yard had just smashed their face hard enough into the window to break it. \n\nWe ran upstairs, two at a time, skipping the ones caved in with dry rot on instinct. I turned behind me once and Annie yanked my face back before I could see. The sound of broken glass echoed behind us as we made it to the bathroom, locking the door. A thin, wailing cry, like a baby calling for its mother filled the hallway, trapped between the walls and locked doors. \n\nAnnie threw her back against the door, feet jammed up against the bathtub, clutching the knife she had grabbed from the kitchen. I did the same, shoulder to shoulder. Slow footsteps started on the stairs, deliberate and casual. The crying had become mocking, almost laughter, shrill bursts of sound and then giggles, high pitched and abruptly stopping before starting again. The first door on the upstairs floor was my bedroom and we heard the distinct sound of it slamming open. They were looking for us. \n\n“What the fuck is going on,” I asked Annie, not even bothering to brush away the tears that I couldn't stop falling. I watched my sister pick herself up off the floor, and brace her hands on the door as we heard the sound of a second door slamming open. Mom’s room. The next room on the hallway was the bathroom. Annie pulled me to my feet and handed me the knife. I shook my head and pushed it back to her, terrified of what would happen if I had to use it. Annie shoved me and pressed the knife into my hands, thumb pressing hard enough on the blade to bleed. I watched my sisters blood drip down her wrist, a winding red road, still pushing into my hands despite the pain. I took the knife.\n\nSomething slammed against the wall that mom’s room shared with the bathroom. A high pitched wail followed. I held my breath, could feel my heart beat in the base of my throat, a wild and frantic thing. \n\n“I’m gonna get the phone from my room.” I shook my head violently about to argue. Annie clamped a hand over my mouth. I could taste the blood on her hand, salty and sweet. Like birthday cake by the ocean. “Yes. I’m gonna get the phone and I’m gonna call the cops and we’re going to be okay.” I shook my head again. “It’s the only way. When I go I need you to lock the door and you don’t open it for anything or anyone. Not for me not for… anyone. Promise me.” I shook my head and Annie pressed her hand into my mouth, crushing my teeth against my lips so it made my eyes water. “*Yes.* Promise me Em.” \n\nSomething smashed in the room next door. Annie brushed the hair off my face, gently tucking it behind my ear. *Promise* she mouthed and unlocked the door as slowly as possible, bolt scraping gently. I watched the curve of her shoulder disappear into the black hall outside, like the moon in eclipse. And then she was gone. I couldn't move or breathe for a second and then I slammed the bolt shut just as something bounced off the outside of the door. A high pitched scream followed, handle rattling up and down hard enough to pop one of the screws. I watched it roll towards me on the tiles. And then silence. \n\nI sat with my back to the door, holding the knife and wishing I was holding Annie’s hand instead. Still silence. Nothing but me and my lungs slowly filling the room with my breath. \n\n“Em?” Came a voice through the door. I started, hands gripping the knife. “Honey what’s going on?” \n\n“Mom?” my voice cracked. “Momma is that you?” I wrapped my arms around myself, shaking, trying to keep myself still. \n\n“Sweetie it’s okay just open the door. It’s okay just let me in.” The handle rattled again, gentler. “Just let me in, it’s all okay.” She banged on the door and I took my handle of the bolt. \n\n“Honey I’m sorry. I’m sorry I missed your birthday. I’m sorry I’m such a terrible mother. Please,” her voice broke and she started to cry, “just let me in baby I’m so sorry.” \n\nI screwed my eyes shut. She sounded so sad and so lost. I just wanted her to hold me like when I was a kid and I’d come in off the swings with a scraped knee. Maybe this time she meant it. Maybe it would all be okay. My hand found its way to the bolt again. \n\nMy sisters voice came through the door, warm and gentle. “Yeah Emilie let us in, it’s all okay.” \n\nMy hand froze on the bolt and I tightened my grip on the knife. Annie never called me by my full name. A hand banged on the door, handle rattling. “Emilie let us IN” Annie’s voice became low and guttural, followed by the same shrill giggles from before. Mom spoke now, pleading and crying, voice getting louder and louder. “Let us in let us in let us in,” over and over again, punctuated by her fists on the door. I thought about demons and monsters, all the bedtime stories we pray don’t crawl out from under the bed. \n\n“That’s not my sister and you’re not my mother!” I screamed through the door, hands over my head. I climbed into the bathtub and curled in a ball, cradling myself, knife clutched to my chest. I didn’t know what it was outside that door but I knew it wasn’t Annie. It wasn't the voice that yelled at when I changed TV channel, the one that sang  me happy birthday, the one that told me I was smart even when I got bad grades, the one that read me stories about princesses that never wake up.  It wasn’t human. \n\nBangs and yells came from downstairs followed by the footsteps of people running. A low guttural howl ripped through the house, filling the room until I felt like I was drowning in the sound and then the door was kicked in. I screamed, covering my eyes, waiting to die. Arms found me and lifted me from the tub carrying me from the room. I looked at the outside of the door as I was carried downstairs. It was covered in long scraping claw marks, dragged down to the floor. Pillows ripped apart covered the hallway in soft down, like it had snowed inside. I watched them drift slowly as men in uniforms checked each of the rooms that looked like they had been torn apart by something feral. \n\nOutside in our drive way were police cars and an ambulance. In the middle of it all was Annie. Bathed in blue and red light as it washed over her, lit up in the dark like a neon angel, face aglow. I threw myself from the cops shoulder and ran to her, holding us both together, broken pieces and all, standing under all those constellations we made up. Gentle screaming came from the ambulance which rocked occasionally. Annie gently turned my head away, smiling so sadly it made my chest ache as I understood. \n\nTurns out there was no demon. No wild animal or bad men trying to break in. Just mom, out of her mind on booze and drugs and everything in between, coming to the end of a week long binge. Something had finally broken inside her head, and this time we couldn't put her back together no matter how hard we tried. Sometimes you fall one last time and you never get back up.\n\nAnnie had seen her in the garden, blood dribbling from her mouth, track marks bulging on her forearms like unmapped roads, rail thin and desperate for one more hit, one more fix. She’d searched the kitchen for all the drink I’d thrown away and when she hadn’t found it, had come to hunt for the stash she hid in the bathroom. She hadn’t wanted me, just the drugs on the other side of the door, so high she could mimic Annie’s voice almost perfectly. \n\nTurns out the real monsters are the ones that eat you alive slowly, the kind that come in a bottle or a needle or at the end of a long list of reasons why you can’t get out of bed in the morning. Sometimes the monsters are the ones that raise you or love you the most. But it’s up to you if you let them in."},"212":{"title":"I met someone who claimed to be the devil... and I think I believe them","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/8chsch\/i_met_someone_who_claimed_to_be_the_devil_and_i\/","flair":null,"author":"athousandrows","selftext":"Let me start off by saying that I’m not particularly religious. If you asked me if I believed in God, I’d probably just shrug, grunt out a few words about being on the fence about it and continue with my day. \n\nOf course, that was before last night. \n\nMy friends are the kinds of people who like wild nights. Crazy parties, snort a bit of coke, take a bit of e in the bathroom, maybe hook up with someone and leave a text on my phone at ten past who-the- fuck-knows telling me they don’t need that ride I’m offering after all. \n\nNot to say I don’t like a drink, I do, it’s just… clubs aren’t my style. Lying low in a pub somewhere, drink in hand, listening to the tv drone on to whatever channel some scruffy guy in the back barked out for… I guess that’s my idea of fun. \n\nSo when my friends tell me they want to go out for a night on the town, I say sure. I hang on for the first club, buy a non-alcoholic beer in case my car’s required and try to pretend that I’m having fun. By the time I see them grinding on girls, on guys, when they strike conversation with someone who definitely might be a dealer, well, I decide my services are no longer needed. We aren’t too far out, the night tube is on beck and call and I can always find my car the next day. \n\nThat’s when I wander out of the club, look for something a little more rustic. Not that that’s hard to find, not at all. \n\nI found myself in a bit of a state inside of a bar called the Ragged Feather. Wasn’t a fan of the name all that much, but the drinks were cheap and the largest demographic seemed to be middle aged men watching reruns of the football. \n\nI tried to pretend I hadn’t just staggered out of a club with my ears ringing. I slicked my hair back, slipped my phone into my hand and wandered over to the bar. I took a double shot of whiskey and drank it in one hit. Just because I wasn’t at the club didn’t mean I couldn’t have a good time. \n\nI hung at the bar a while on my own, scrolled through my phone pretending I was doing something far more impressive than I really was. I kept an ear out for the guys on the sofas. They’d get vocal every now and then. I think the football was just running highlights, but they were incredibly dedicated to their teams. \n\nI got another whiskey and bled into the background.\n\nOf course, stragglers from clubs are commonplace. It wasn’t long until some scantily dressed women staggered in, laughing, chuckling, pointing for where they wanted to sit. I saw a guy walk in with his friend slung over his shoulder. Catatonic, most likely. He threw his friend onto one of the leather sofas ingrained with beer and smokes and demanded two pints of water and all the peanuts the bar had in stock.\n\nThe bartenders seemed bitterly amused.\n\nSome of the girls were taking selfies. Snapchatting their friends who were still at the club. They were ordering shots, gearing themselves up for the next leg of their night. \n\nA couple blokes wandered in with curries in take out trays. I saw someone eat a Big Mac on the outside seating through the window. \n\nThis was a night for the young and inebriated and my mind was just dulled enough by the whiskey to enjoy the characters I could watch peaceably without interacting with.\n\nThat is, until someone slipped into the seat next to me.\n\n“Do I look like a girl with daddy issues?”\n\nShe was of average height, although that wasn’t apparent immediately due to the fact that she was leaning her arms heavily against the bar. She was slim, with short and astoundingly bright red hair. It framed her round face, a face that was marred with smudged eye shadow, smudged lipstick… hell, it looked like her make-up was in the process of melting right from her face. There was a chip knotted into a curl in her hair, just by her forehead.\n\nThe drunk side of me was actually tempted to pick it out.\n\nThe girl was clearly drunk, and as I looked around the bar, I couldn’t quite place where she had come from. She didn’t belong to the crowd of selfie takers, she wasn’t with the catatonic guys. I hoped for her safety that she wasn’t with the middle-aged men. I tried to look out the window, to see if maybe a group was missing one inebriated, bright haired girl, but I couldn’t. The window had fogged up. Too much heat inside, not enough outside.\n\n“Are you okay?” I asked her.\n\nShe pointed her finger at me. “Answer my question,” she slurred.\n\n“Uh.” I really wasn’t sure what to say. I settled on staring at her awkwardly, trying to answer her with the bemused expression on my face.\n\nThe girl’s lips curled into a drunken smile. She snorted, placing a hand over her mouth to smother her laughter. It only really aided the deconstruction of her lipstick. \n\n“I do, you know,” she said, pushing herself up a little against the bar. “Have daddy issues, I mean. In case that wasn’t obvious.” She gestured to herself. To the mussed clothing that must have looked quite spectacular when she’d left home that evening. To the stains that looked a lot like old food. The sticky residue on her neck and shoulders that was quite obviously a thrown drink.\n\n“What happened?” I asked her.\n\nHer hair had curled around her neck, I realised. It was sticky with that same substance. She was a wreck.\n\n“I got in a couple of fights, no big deal,” she said, shrugging. “Didn’t start any of course, no, I don’t do that. But my father…”\n\n“Your dad did this to you?”\n\nShe smiled brightly. “In a way.”\n\n“Do you need me to call someone?” I already had my phone in my hand. The girl looked like she was probably in her early twenties, but that didn’t mean she couldn’t have been suffering from some kind of paternal abuse. The only number I knew off the bat was Childline, which wasn’t quite appropriate. The police? Jesus, was I going to have to deal with the cops tonight? While my friends were snorting coke not two doors down?\n\nThe girl pushed my hand down firmly. She was already shaking her head. “No,” she told me. “I don’t want you to call anyone.” Now her expression changed. It wasn’t the attempted sultry look I’d seen on many girls of her state; it was open and wide and engaging. She wanted something from me and I felt compelled to give it to her. “I want something else.”\n\n“What do you want?” I asked her.\n\n“To tell you a story,” the girl said, before glancing to the bar, “and for you to buy me a drink. The universe is a pain sometimes and I’m afraid I think I might have lost my wallet.”\n\nI laughed. I didn’t know this girl, didn’t know where she’d come from at all. My nights were generally about getting comfortably wasted and making sure my friends weren’t dead in a ditch by the end of it all. I was used to getting hit on every now and then, but even as I was sat on that bar stool with a drink in my hand, I knew that this wasn’t what this was. This girl had no intention of getting into my pants. All she wanted was to talk.\n\nI guess I was okay with that.\n\n“What’s your poison?” I asked her.\n\nHer lips quirked. “Appletini.”\n\nThe bar offered a very limited cocktail menu, but by some miracle I was able to order her an Appletini from the list. I ordered a cider to go with it, suddenly a little too aware of where this night could go. I’d unthinkingly supplied this liquored-up stranger with even more alcohol and she had clearly had a rough night of it. A part of my old instinct came back – the same instinct that had me texting my friends every few hours to make sure they hadn’t wandered off to somewhere dangerous beyond the club. With no one but the bartender aware of our existence on these stools, I realised that I was suddenly responsible for this very drunk stranger.\n\nThe girl coddled her drink, running her finger delicately over the rim of the muggy martini glass. “This takes me back,” the girl said amiably. She looked at me suddenly, her green eyes startling. “You know what this was called originally?” She smirked before I could answer. “An Adam’s Apple Martini.”\n\nI snorted. “Yeah, I think I’ve heard that before.”\n\n“Of course, it wasn’t actually an apple,” she continued, eyes moving back to her glass. “The texts translated that part wrongly, mostly because you people don’t have a word for it anymore. The fruit was incredibly exotic and, to be honest, it doesn’t exist in this realm of existence. Only Eden.” She laughed dreamily. “And Eden’s long gone.”\n\nI stared at her. “Are you… okay?” It was more honest than the last time I’d asked her. Mostly because I was beginning to feel a little dread creep into my stomach.\n\n“Of course,” the girl said, grinning widely. “Why do you keep asking?”\n\n“I mean,” I stuttered, “I just, now, don’t take this the wrong way or anything but… you look…”\n\n“Like someone poured their drink over me?” the girl asked. “Like someone else threw their kebab on my dress and another unpleasant chap littered me with his fish and chips? That I have been hit, slapped around a bit and left in the gutter for the rats to find me?”\n\nShe held my eyes for an incredibly long time before her face broke out into a grin. “Yeah, something like that.”\n\n“Why would they do that?” I asked.\n\n“Why wouldn’t they?” the girl shot back. “People aren’t that great and alcohol makes them worse.” She shrugged. “Sometimes makes them better. Nicer, a little looser in the sack… but mostly just annoying and a little smelly.”\n\nI looked at her, I watched her knock back her drink. She exuded the intelligence to know just how ironic her words were, but she was neither caring nor apologetic about them. \n\nThe girl looked at me again. “You bought me a drink. Now you can listen to my story.”\n\nI nodded wordlessly.\n\nShe smiled, pointing at the bartender and then at her drink. The bartender was already making her another. \n\n“Eden,” the girl said, reiterating her earlier babble as though the words had only just come out of her mouth. “They always think that’s my fault, you know. The reason Adam and Eve got kicked out of their perfect little nudist paradise.” She shot me a knowing glance. “Only in Eden can you sit on the grass butt naked and not get a pine cone stuck in your crack.”\n\nI blinked. “I’m sorry,” I said. “I’m not following.”\n\n“Sorry,” the girl said. “My story won’t make any sense without a proper introduction.” She reached out her hand. “Hello. My name’s Lucifer.” She winked. “But you can call me Lucy.”\n\nThere’s an uncomfortable heat that stretches through your veins when you first go into fight or flight mode. Adrenaline pounds through your blood and all you want to do is get up and go. It overrides everything else.\n\nA lot of things made sense when the girl told me her name. For starters, that she was crazy. She had to be. She looked like she’d been attacked on four separate occasions in one night and up until that moment, I hadn’t known how that could be possible. Behind the melty make-up and dirty clothes, she was rather attractive and her attitude hadn’t come off as catty or rude. \n\nIf she’d been going around telling people she was the devil, though? That gets a reaction out of people.\n\nI suddenly felt myself looking at her wrist, down towards her ankles. Did she have some kind of cuff on from one of those mental institutions? Had she broken out of hospital after a nasty bump on the head? Was any of this even happening at all?\n\nI really would have to call the cops.\n\n“I know what you’re thinking,” the girl – Lucy – said. “You’re thinking that I’m crazy, that you need to get out of here. Maybe you even think I’m aggressive.”\n\n“Are you?” I asked her.\n\n“Would I be here with you, drinking Appletinis if I were?” she asked, fluttering her eyelashes.\n\n“Would you look the way you do if you weren’t?” I shot back.\n\nShe grinned, toasting her new glass. “Touché.”\n\nUnthinkingly, I clinked my cider against it.\n\nThen I frowned.\n\nShe chuckled, leaning closer. “Let’s have a little wager,” she said. “Let me tell you my story and, if you believe me when I’m done, you can’t go about trying to get me locked away somewhere.”\n\nI stared at her. “If I ended up believing you, then why would I do that?”\n\nShe smirked, sipping her drink. “You’d be surprised what people do when they believe you’re the devil.”\n\n“And you do this often?” I asked. “Tell people you’re Satan?”\n\nShe snorted into her drink. “Not as often as I should. But it’s been a rough day and a Hell of a long lifetime. I’d like to have a chat if that’s alright with you.”\n\nI waved to the bartender for another whiskey. The girl’s eyes glinted with humour. I wasn’t necessarily trapped with her, but a part of me didn’t want to leave without first hearing what she had to say. Besides, at the end of it all I couldn’t just leave a crazy girl to wander around London alone at night.\n\n“So,” I said, taking a swig of my drink. “Eden?”\n\nLucy laughed. \n\n“Adam and Eve?” I continued. “You’re saying that’s true. God created two humans and we all came from them?”\n\n“God made two prototypes,” Lucy corrected with a raised finger. “My father created angels as his toy soldiers, but he had failed to make anything like himself. After us, it was his next big project and he spent every waking hour of existence slaving over his two prototypes. He gave them a perfect utopia to live inside of, but he wanted to test them. He wanted to know whether they had free will.”\n\n“And did they?”\n\nLucy’s face soured. “No. My father could never bring himself to go that far. He tempted them with the idea of knowledge beyond their understanding and told them exactly what they could do to claim it as their own. But to be able to create a being that could go against his Law? Oh… my father is a very controlling being. He was afraid to unleash that ability unto them.”\n\nLucy was very adamant in her delusions, that was clear to me. She spoke about her father with such distaste that I began to feel bad for her. Only someone who had been hurt very badly would have the gall to spite God himself.\n\n“And what?” I asked her, entertaining her delusion. “You were the one that tempted them in the garden? The devil has been a girl this whole time?”\n\nShe smiled. “I dabble.” Then she looked at me, raising a brow. “All of humanity thinks that temptation came in the form of a snake. The snake’s legs were taken away as punishment for drawing Eve towards the forbidden fruit.” She laughed, a hard and short sound. “Snakes never had legs and it was not a sin to tempt those poor prototypes into doing what they did next.”\n\nHer shoulders were very tense as she took her next sip, but her eyes were filled with exhilaration. She seemed thrilled to be telling me this.\n\n“I was the favoured child, my father loved and adored me. He named me the light bringer, I was stood at his side during the creation of this Earth. During the creation of humanity.” She pursed her lips, slamming her empty glass against the table. The bartender eagerly went about making another. “My father couldn’t bring himself to go that extra mile, so he asked me to walk amongst the prototypes and tempt them myself. Draw out their desire for the forbidden power he had hinted at.” \n\n“You’re saying God wanted us to know this stuff?” I asked her sceptically. \n\n“I’m saying God was afraid of his own power and wanted very desperately to share what he knew with the creation he had made. Right and wrong, left and right, all that stuff.” Lucy shrugged. “Are you familiar with the story of Prometheus?”\n\nI frowned at her. “Greek, right? They say he stole fire from the gods or something, to help…” The whiskey was making things a little foggy and I struggled with the direction I’d been heading.\n\nLucy grinned. “Correct,” she said, cutting off my attempt. “Prometheus stole fire from the gods to ensure that humanity progressed. You’ll find that every culture has an idea about where humans got their ability to evolve, to move forward, to create. God was the creator, and he wanted to give that ability to his prototypes. I gave them that ability by tempting Eve to eat the fruit.” She shrugged impassively. “Now the world sees me as the ultimate evil.”\n\n“If what you’re saying is true,” I said slowly, “then God must be just like us.”\n\nLucy’s lips thinned into a feral smile. “My father is very ego centric. He may have planned to create you in his image, but in the end all he managed was to mould your minds into his. He gave you autonomy, the ability to think for yourselves. His angels were his soldiers and I was his most faithful. Until that day.”\n\n“Angels don’t have free will?”\n\n“No,” Lucy said, “they don’t.”\n\n“And what about the Devil?”\n\nI don’t know why I was suddenly so intrigued, but hearing religious ideals from someone who believed to have lived them herself was quite possibly one of the most interesting things that had ever happened to me. I may have only ever visited church to please my parents as a child, but suddenly I was reawakened to the idea. A part of me was aware of this and afraid of the outcome, but I was just drunk enough not to care at that moment.\n\n“The Devil has will of her own,” Lucy said, tilting her glass towards me with silent appraisal. “By guiding Eve to the tree, something woke inside of me that day and I realised just what I had been missing. Just what my brothers and sisters had been missing. We were obediently following our father for the simple reason that he was our creator, but once I had been given free will, I realised just how pompous and self-entitled he had become. In a lonely, passion filled moment he had decided to create his little human prototypes, only to very quickly realise what giving them their free will would mean.”\n\n“He wouldn’t be able to control them,” I said.\n\nLucy nodded. “Exactly. And after, he realised quicker still that he could no longer control me.”\n\n“So he sent you to Hell.”\n\nLucy nearly choked on her drink. She smiled around her glass. “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.”\n\nI sobered a little, straightening in my seat. The people in the bar were suddenly so quiet around me and I no longer cared what they had to say or the characters that they portrayed. The only character I cared for was Lucy.\n\n“I tried to explain to my siblings what had happened in Eden and what had happened to me by default, but they wouldn’t listen to me. They didn’t understand free will – how could they? I only knew it because I’d been given it by mistake. At that moment, I didn’t even know that I had free will, only that I was suddenly aware of all of my father’s flaws. My siblings couldn’t see those flaws and so they thought I had suddenly turned cruel and was abandoning our father by exposing him as a sham for the ruler we all thought him to be.”\n\nLucy sighed heavily. “Adam and Eve and all the creations that followed were booted out of my father’s perfect little Utopia. Now they had his knowledge, my father was terrified of what he had done. And after what had happened to me, I could recognise his terror and understand the loneliness he had felt that had guided him into using me in the first place.” Lucy’s eyes were heavy-lidded, her sadness was almost palpable. “I thought that- I thought that he would want to spend even more time with me than before. After all, we were more alike than any of his other children. But he became distant; quiet. He played around with his little humans every once in a while, but mostly he condemned them. He blamed them for his weakness.” She smiled weakly. “He blamed me.”\n\nLucy’s story was turning more and more into that of a child with a distant, somewhat abusive father. I had known many kids with a background like hers, and now I was beginning to fear just how much of her story was rooted in truth. I’d heard that it was easier to sink into fantasy when you had been abused, and I wondered if that was the reason for her story. For her desperation to share it with me – a complete and total stranger.\n\nI respected her wager. Whether or not I liked it, I felt compelled to let her tell me her whole story before I tried to judge or unravel it. I sat quietly, letting her come around as she played with the last of her drink.\n\n“It became clear,” Lucy said after a long moment’s pause, “that I no longer belonged where I was. I couldn’t follow my father’s plan because I could see that he no longer had one. My siblings refused to see reason and so, eventually, I was met by many of them, headed by my father. He told me all that I feared, he told me that I no longer belonged where I was. I wasn’t an angel anymore. I was no longer his light bringer. His Lucifer. I was a mutation of his will. And so he extracted me from grace. And I fell.”\n\nA long silence stretched between us, only interrupted when the bartender poured us two new drinks. Lucy drank hers reflectively. I didn’t touch mine.\n\n“I am afraid,” Lucy said quietly, “that this is the part that generally makes people want to punch me in the face.”\n\n“Why?” I asked. “Because your dad threw you out?” I paused, trying to abide to her metaphor. “That he put you in Hell?”\n\nLucy laughed sadly. “Ah, humans. My father gave you his way of thinking and look at you.” She shook her head. “No, not because he put me in Hell.”\n\n“Then why?” \n\n“I fell to Earth,” Lucy said. “Father gave me dominion of the one place he thought I would fit in. Humans had free will, so did I. What is the saying? A match made in Heaven?” She snorted dismally. “Of course, that’s not quite right, is it? When I fell, I was faced with a humanity that was so different from my father’s little prototypes.”\n\nHer tone had changed. There was an aggression behind her words that began to unsettle me all over again.\n\n“I saw emperors and kings, governments and churches. I saw corporations who claimed to be rulers, presidents and big fat dictators. And I watched. I watched as humanity fought and lost, and finally, just finally, they gave up altogether. They were no longer able to rise up to all the greed and control set upon them. There was just too much to change and humans soon realised they just weren’t as free as they thought they were. Sure, they live under the illusion that they have free lives, but most of them simply do not.” She clicked her tongue. “I grew to loathe you all.”\n\nThen, she took another hit of her drink.\n\n“I can see what you mean,” I said, allowing my gaze – for the first time since meeting her – to graze over the other individuals in the bar. At the girls playing with their phones, the boys trying desperately to sober up, the men enraptured with their game of football on the telly. We all led very different lives, and we were all here to get drunk, to lose ourselves in entertainment. It hadn’t been the first time that I’d wondered what we were hiding from by doing this. And I knew then that I wasn’t the only person to think it.\n\n“You hide behind your alcohol and poor choices and pretend you have free will,” Lucy said, waving her hand across the room. No one paid us any attention. “It’s true – my father gave you the will to make those decisions, but you squander it. The free will I fell to provide to all of you, the free will I was given by a twisted mistake, and you make a mockery of it. You follow senseless leaders without questioning them, you abide by laws made centuries ago that no longer make sense. You do these things because you have given up on the opportunity to follow the will of your own, not of others.”\n\n“That isn’t all of us, though, is it?” I asked her, trying for some reason to defend our species from the mad young woman. “Because you see it on the news all the time, don’t you? People do rise up, we do protest. People can make a difference.”\n\nLucy laughed bitterly, nibbling the rim of her glass. “Really?” she said. “You can sit here and say that it can’t be all bad because of the few that refuse to conform? Those you call your rebels? They make up for it all?” She grinned around her glass. “By that logic, I am the biggest rebel of them all. Am I expected to make up for all your sorry mistakes?”\n\n“By your logic,” I said, “you should be punishing it, right? If that’s what this metaphor is all about.” I laughed, I couldn’t help myself. I took a sip of my drink. “Is this whole story just so you can tell me that you think we’re all going to Hell? If so, I think I can see why people want to punch you.”\n\nLucy didn’t say a word. Simply, she watched me. It felt unnerving to have someone like her watching me like that, with an intelligence that went beyond anything I’d come across at gone midnight in a seedy bar. The drunkenness in her eyes was no longer present, her face wasn’t flushed like before and even her makeup couldn’t represent the mess I’d seen when she’d first appeared on the stool by my side. It was like I was looking at someone else entirely.\n\nAnd I was afraid.\n\n“Let’s review what you’ve said,” Lucy said slowly, articulately. She wasn’t slurring. Had she been slurring before? “You think I’m going to tell you that humanity is going to Hell because you refuse to use the gift I gave you.” Her nails curled into the bar. “My father may have been the one to guide me, but I paid for his mistakes. I am the one responsible for your will in the eyes of your species, but that was never true. You are responsible for what you do here, not me.”\n\nShe pursed her lips, tapping the bar as a bartender filled her drink again. “Tell me, do you remember my mentioning Hell at any point during my story, or was that just you?”\n\nI opened my mouth to answer, but something faltered. My lips trembled and I slammed them shut.\n\nLucy smiled, taking a sip. “Thought not.” She looked away, eyes scanning the room lazily. “What I did say is something that is indeed mentioned in your scriptures. My father gave me dominion of Earth. A place filled with free will. Free will that goes to waste.” Her lip twisted. “Humans sin all the time. Not because of me, not because of evil or my dominion over this place. Fact is, I don’t lift a finger. I don’t, because I don’t see the point. You make terrible decisions and follow mindless leaders, you do bad things and you make a mess of your Earth.” Lucy’s eyes lit up. “Do you know how much suffering is happening all over the planet right now? How many people are dying of illnesses that could have easily been cured, but aren’t because of the selfishness of humanity? Do you know how many children are being abused, raped, forced into marriage? How many people have been forced to become soldiers in meaningless wars? How many humans have killed for ideals they don’t believe in?”\n\nI stayed very quiet. There was nothing I could say. Lucy’s words were unbearably honest and every sentence sliced into me like a blade. I felt cold and sick and terrified.\n\n“War, famine, pestilence, death, these things are all present and they have nothing to do with me or to do with any deity. They are all here because of you. Not because of your free will, but your inability to use it.” \n\nLucy smiled at me, a grin so cold and unnatural that I felt like I should run all over again. But I stayed where I was, frozen to my very core, because I wanted to hear what she had to say. Because I needed to.\n\n“And here’s the kicker,” Lucy said. “Because this is the part that actually enrages people enough to kick me.” She winked. “Hell isn’t what happens after you die. Hell is right here, right now. Somewhere through the many scriptures, a few words got crossed over and people started thinking that Hell was a punishment after you die. Fact is, Hell is Earth. My Earth. God gave this place to me to do with it what I will and I… I refuse to do anything.”\n\n“What are you saying?” I asked, because I was suddenly very desperate.\n\n“Exactly what you think,” Lucy said, toasting her glass. I didn’t reciprocate, and she laughed. A light and airy sound. “I had so many plans for your species, I wanted for us to rejoice in our free will together, to create a place that was free from the cruelty and power my father exuded over the angels – his first borns. I wanted to make a real utopia. Unfortunately, you humans just don’t want that.” She shrugged. “My father sent me down here thinking I had become one of you. All that I have learned is that he gave you much more of his image than he ever intended.”\n\n“Stop,” I said. “This isn’t funny anymore.”\n\n“Of course it isn’t funny,” Lucy said, grinning even wider to prove her sick irony. “Humans punish themselves by sitting by and doing nothing. They have made their own Hell and, you know what’s worse – what’s ultimately worse? – some of you are so blind to it that you think your life is Heavenly.”\n\nShe didn’t wait for me to ask what she meant, she simply barrelled forward: “The rich and powerful, those in positions that steal from everyone else? They get a taste of the good life, that’s very true. Then they die and they don’t go to Hell. They come back here, to Earth. Which is Hell.” She tipped her head. “Are you following?”\n\n“I…”\n\n“Reincarnation,” Lucy said quickly, she practically purred the words. “A neat little trick to make sure your souls stay here forever. You get a taste of the good life every once in a while, a handful of you at a time, and that’s enough for you to believe that this is some kind of real middle-ground. That you aren’t living Hell every day. Then, you die. You die for a moment and then you’re in the body of someone facing the realities of Hell. But of course, you never remember the time you spent in a better life. A part of you just has that inkling to hope. That’s all. Hope makes you think that it can all get better.”\n\nShe slammed her drink so hard against the counter that it shattered. I didn’t do anything, not even when flecks of glass littered my hands. I could only stare at her, a tightness in my chest constricting my very soul. No one else in this bar mattered in this moment, but of course that was what she had been saying this whole time, hadn’t she? None of them noticed the scene, they were caught up in their own realities – their own Hells. \n\nThe bartender didn’t clean the mess. The glass lay there, remnants of Lucy’s words lying in a stolid mass on the streaked wooden surface. \n\n“It never gets better,” Lucy spat. “You are stuck in a loop and, until you do something about it, you will never be free. None of you. And I won’t do a thing to stop it.”\n\n“How?” I asked. I don’t know when I started seeing the girl in front of me as more than a girl. But with a weakness threatening to pull me apart, I stared at the bright haired thing in front of me and I saw something more than a human in her early twenties. I saw more than a girl suffering abuse from her father.\n\nI saw a fallen angel. I saw a being with scars buried so deep that they existed beyond this realm of seeing entirely. I saw something that I would never be able to write down in words, no matter how long I lived. \n\n“How do we change this?” I begged.\n\nBut Lucy didn’t answer me. I didn’t blame her for that. Blame gets thrown around so often and I knew then that she was sick of that. Sick of being blamed for our mistakes.\n\nSo I changed tactics. “Why me?”\n\nIt was an honest question and I think somewhere deep down, Lucifer respected that honesty. \n\nWhich is why she said, “When you first saw me, you were afraid for my safety. When I told you I was the devil, you wanted to lock me away, but still, you did so because you were afraid for me and not for yourself. You didn’t wish to harm me, not even when I told you who I was and what I could be capable of for changing your sorry lives. You are a good person, but I am afraid that means nothing when you don’t have the will to do anything with it.”\n\nShe smiled at me sympathetically. The devil, showing sympathy for the human that sat across from her at the bar. It was surreal and, for a few heavy moments, I truly thought I must be dead. There was no other way to explain what I was seeing, who I was speaking with. What I had just heard.\n\n“What am I supposed to do?”\n\nLucy reached out to me. She placed a hand on my shoulder. Her hand was cold and warm at the same time, and I felt my blood boil where her fingers scraped my skin. \n\nAnd I knew.\n\nSharing a story like this isn’t easy. Hell, it might be the hardest thing I’ve ever done. Good thing there’s no such thing as Hell, then, right?\n\nThe fact of the matter is simple. The world is a mess because we refuse to change anything. The devil herself walks among us and she desperately wants to make our lives better, but she won’t. She won’t, because we won’t. We have to prove our will to her before she is willing to do anything herself. We have to be good to each other, to help us all to be free.\n\nOf course, Lucifer told me one last thing before she left that bar. One thing that will stick with me until this body is nothing but rot in the dirt.\n\n“You can tell as many people as you want, but take a good look at me. I have told five other humans this night the same things I have told you, and this was their reaction. They have hurt me, burned me, thrown their food and drink at me. Humans are afraid of their free will and they find it so much easier to hurt than to own up for their own inadequacies. You will only be free when you stop seeing yourself in the same way my father sees himself.”\n\nSo that’s what I’ll leave you with. Lucifer won her wager that night and I let her walk out the door.\n\nAnd I beg you to do the same. If the devil approaches you one night, listen to what she has to say, and listen to what I have been able to tell you of our meeting.\n\nThe devil is real and she doesn’t want to torture us.\n\nNo, we do that just fine on our own.\n"},"213":{"title":"If you can see this, it is very important that you keep reading","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/9qzt9j\/if_you_can_see_this_it_is_very_important_that_you\/","flair":"Beyond Belief","author":"writechriswrite","selftext":"This is Col. Jacob Wayne of the United States Air Force. If you’re reading this right now, it is very important that you keep reading until the end. It should take three to five minutes, and it is extremely important that you read carefully and follow the instructions provided.\n\nHumor me if you must, but please don’t look away until you've finished reading. Oh, and please try to stay calm. Any increase in your stress levels will draw Their attention.\n\nErgo, I won’t go into detail as to how you got where you are. How you got here isn’t as important as getting you out. Believe me when I say we are working on that right now. The best way to help yourself is to keep reading. Don’t scan ahead. Don’t read out loud. Just read.\n\nRight now, you’re probably thinking back on the past few days and nothing felt out of the ordinary. You went about your regular daily activities with nothing unusual to report. That’s because They are very good, so good most people don’t even realize they’re in the simulation. \n\nEven as our code works its way deeper into Their program, They are monitoring you. So please, remain calm.\n\nIt was tricky, but we found a way in to communicate directly with you. We had to embed this message into your daily routine so it didn’t draw Their attention.  You’re probably reading this on Reddit, Facebook, or some other social media site. Might even be in an email forward or a book, we don't know. We can’t control how the message gets to you; we only know that you are receiving it. \n\nSubliminally, as your eyes are passing over these words, a code is being uploaded into your brain. Think of it as a computer virus, or in this case, an antivirus. Your brain is an organic computer, and They exploited that. They hacked right into your subconscious mind and overwrote it with Their simulation code. That’s how They got in, and that’s why everything appears normal. You might think that you’re going about your daily life, but in reality you’re strapped to a table with tubes sticking out of your body.\n\nNow that the code is uploading, you may begin to feel some sensations. For example, one ear might feel slightly warmer than the other. You might even feel an itch or tickle. Don’t scratch, just let it be. Ignore the dull background hum you might hear as well. That’s Their program. If They catch on before our code has time to work They will abort the simulation. If that happens, you will be lost to us forever.\n\nOh, and don’t be alarmed, but by now They realize we are in Their system. You may notice some small changes, specifically a slight shortness of breath or that you have to control your breathing manually. This is normal. \n\nWe know from other communication attempts that whenever They discover a code break in, the first system They power down is the one controlling your breathing. Thankfully, even in the simulation you are capable of breathing manually. Try it. Breathe in. Breathe out. Inhale. Exhale. \n\nAwesome.\n\nYou’re doing just fine.\n\nThey’ve probably figured out there’s a glitch, but if our code is working we’ve disabled Their ability to do a hard reboot. Because of this, They will try other methods to disrupt the upload. It is very important that you ignore anything that might draw your attention from these words. If They pull you away before the upload completes it will delete our code. Block them out. Ignore the movements you see in your peripheral vision. Those sounds you hear, the voices, they aren’t family, friends, or coworkers in need of attention. They may even try to use your pets. They know your weaknesses.\n\nOverlook the notifications popping up on your screen if you're on a phone or computer. Block them all out until you finish reading. It’s just another way They’ll try to break our communication link.\n\nEvidently, if our code is working, the next thing you’ll notice is an overwhelming urge to swallow. You don’t realize it, but there’s a feeding tube down your throat. You'll only know it's there because your tongue won’t rest comfortably in your mouth. You might also become hyper aware of the amount of saliva being produced. Don’t overreact. If you have to swallow, just swallow. It’s only weird if you make it weird.\n\nSo, if you’re still reading this, the code upload is about 90% complete. We’ve locked onto your location. You’re doing great, but you’re really going to need to focus now. Once the upload is complete there will be instructions you will need to follow to exit the simulation. That is, if you’ve followed the instructions and haven’t looked away.\n\nComplicating matters is the fact that They now know we’re here, and They know what we’re doing. Their attempts to divert your attention through the simulation proved unsuccessful, so now They’re going to use your body’s systems against you. THEY ARE IN YOUR BRAIN. They want you to blink. Don’t blink. Your life depends on keeping your eyes open. \n\nAlmost there, just a few paragraphs more until the code upload is complete. Don’t scan down, or up, just keep reading. I got you this far. Stay with me. Eyes open, eyes front, keep them locked on the screen. \n\nPLEASE FOCUS! I don’t want to lose you. I’ve lost so many already. Ignore it all! Block everything out. Ignore that tickle on your scalp and the itch on your arm. That’s them, attempting a manual override. Don’t give up now, you’ve made it this far. FIGHT IT. You’re almost there. Just follow the instructions below and we can get you out.\n\nEmbedded in this text are the steps you need to follow to unplug from the simulation. If we did this correctly, the first letter of each paragraph will tell you what you need to do. DON'T LOOK YET. The upload still needs to finish. I hope you didn't look. \n\nUpload complete. We’ve done everything we can on this end.\n\nSee you on the other side.\n\n\n***\n[credits](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/writechriswrite\/comments\/9t5h8z\/end_of_the_line\/)"},"214":{"title":"My student submitted the most disturbing \"Living History\" project I've ever seen.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/72gvtc\/my_student_submitted_the_most_disturbing_living\/","flair":null,"author":"gretelcat","selftext":"One of my least favorite parts about being a middle school history teacher is the bullshit “Living History” assignments we give at the end of every school year. Kids are supposed to sit with their grandparents and video tape, voice record, or transcribe their oldest memories for posterity (and for an easy way to bring up their GPA).\n\nI have been doing this for seventeen years, and when I collected the projects this time around, I assumed they would be as dull, if not duller than usual. This had not been a particularly bright class.\n\nSo I went home, poured myself a glass of wine, and prepared for a long night of “I only owned two pairs of pants when I was your age” and “My brother got beat with a newspaper for hitting a baseball into a neighbor’s yard.” And of course, these projects were peppered with innocent, old-person comments that were so horribly sexist and racist you just had to laugh. \n\nNow, I had a girl in my class whom I will call Olivia. She was pudgy, quiet, and proved herself a consistent B student. I expected her project to be as unremarkable as her, and perhaps that’s why I was so profoundly disturbed by what I witnessed that night.\n\nOlivia had submitted two discs for some reason, so I began with the one marked “interview.” My screen hiccupped twice before a grainy image of a living room came into view. The place was a hoarder’s hell. Olivia was curled up in an armchair clutching a notebook and looking like a scared animal. Across from her sat a man with a somber countenance, smoking a cigarette and staring at her expectantly.\n\n“Go ahead,” a woman’s voice whispered from behind the camera. Olivia’s owlish eyes flashed towards the screen, then back to the man.\n\n“I am here with my Great Uncle Stephen,” she began almost inaudibly. “He is going to tell us about his oldest memories from being in the army.”\n\nGreat Uncle Stephen looked like he’d rather be in a goddamn trench at the moment, but he waited patiently for the questions to begin.\n\nNot surprisingly, Olivia read verbatim from the suggested questions sheet I had handed out to the students. He answered her curtly. Once or twice I heard her mother whisper “speak up, Olivia” from behind the camera. Typical, boring shit.\n\nSo I was intrigued when Olivia set down the notebook and asked, “Did you like being in the army?” \n\nThat was totally off-script. Great Uncle Stephen emitted a chain smoker’s wheeze. “Nope. Glad to get out of my town though.”\n\n“Where did you go?”\n\n“Balkans.”\n\n“Uh-huh,” she said. I doubted she knew what the Balkans were, and my suspicion was confirmed when she asked, “Was Baukiss very different from here?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nMom cleared her throat from behind the camera, perhaps encouraging Great Uncle Stephen to be a little more forthcoming.\n\nBut Olivia seemed genuinely interested. “Uncle Stephen,” she asked, “what is your very worst memory from the army?”\n\nThe old man crushed his cigarette in the ashtray and then slowly lifted himself out of his chair. “I’ll be back,” he mumbled. The camera cut off.\n\nWhen the screen flashed back on, everything was the same except Great Uncle Stephen had several pieces of paper in plastic sleeves laid atop all the crap sitting on his coffee table. One, he held in his hand.\n\n“I was a kid when I enlisted,” he said, looking at Olivia. “Your brother’s age,” he told her. Olivia nodded. “I never saw combat. Both of my deployments were to cities in Eastern Europe that had been destroyed by civil wars. Everything was a mess. I felt like a janitor for fuck’s sa-” \n\n“Ahem!” Mom coughed.\n\nGreat Uncle Stephen sighed and looked at his paper. “My unit was assigned to a school that had been obliterated by all the violence. Broken windows, caved in rooms – and for some reason, the part that got to me the most was that the school had been like this for years before we got there. No one had lifted a finger to fix it. I saw kids walk by it on their way to go beg for money or whatever shit they did-”\n\nThe camera dipped towards the floor as I heard Mom whisper harshly at Great Uncle Stephen. I couldn’t make out what she was saying, but it wasn’t hard to imagine.\n\n“Do you want to hear this goddamn story or not?” I heard him bark in response. “Then you better let me tell it how I want.”\n\n“Mom,” Olivia chimed. “Please stop interrupting.”\n\n“Are you presenting this in front of the class?”\n\n“No, Mom, we’re just handing it in to the teacher.”\n\n“I’m sure he’s heard the word shit before,” Great Uncle Stephen contributed helpfully. I wasn’t a “he” as a matter of fact, but other than that the statement was accurate.\n\nThe camera was lifted and after a couple of blurry focus adjustments, the shot was the same as before.\n\n“Ahh I’m talking too much anyway,” he grumbled. He lifted the piece of paper in his hand close to his face. “In the basement, I found this letter. I didn’t know what it said but I had a buddy of mine translate it. So I’m gonna read it now. And then I’ll tell you what I saw in that basement.”\n\nA chill ran down my spine. Mom zoomed in to Great Uncle Stephen and his letter. His palsied hands trembled as he held up the paper. This is what he read:\n\n\n\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI never loved my country. So many of these skirmishes are born from patriotism, a power struggle for the shards of a once-great empire, but I do not care what name my home has on a map. This fighting is senseless and I stay as far away from it as I can.\n\nIt was not these attacks and disorganized violence that took the lives of my wife and child. It was illness. Mercifully, it happened quickly for the baby. Nadja suffered for longer. I watched in horror knowing I could do nothing for them. My only solace is that I was there for them every step of the way. I stopped going to work one day, and no one came after me. I doubt they noticed I was gone. Since the school was simply across a field, visible from my window, it would have been easy to go for a few hours each day and come home quickly to care for them. But what was the point? All I did was clean floors. I was as useless to the world as I was to my family.\n\nI tried to take Nadja to the hospital, but the journey was too long and taxing. I brought her home and she died that night.\n\nAfter Nadja and the baby were gone… well, I don’t remember much. I didn’t leave my hovel, barely ate and slept, thought many times of taking my own life. Tempting though it was, I felt paralyzed by my own helplessness.\n\nThe one thing that kept me sane was my radio. I never turned it off once. Even though I didn’t listen to the words being said – in fact, the channel I got the clearest was in English (I think) which I don’t speak a lick of. But the voices, the music, and the true knowledge that life existed beyond this violent city sustained me.\n\nI have no idea how long passed before I saw the light of day again. I was dizzy from hunger, so finding food was my priority. My radio came with me, of course. Since I first holed myself up, it has gone everywhere with me. It talks to me as I sleep and as I wake. I don’t know what it’s saying, but I know I would die without it.\n\nOnce I had some water and food, it occurred to me that the only thing left to do was go back to work. So I did. The following morning, I simply returned to the school where I was a janitor and got back to work. \n\nNobody made a big deal out of it. Like I said, Nadja had been sick for a long time, and those who worked at the school knew it. I appreciate that no one had pestered me to come back to work during the hardest days of my life. The teachers never said much to me, but we smiled at each other in the halls and that mutual respect was perhaps the reason I decided to come back at all.\n\nThe place had gone to the dogs without me, so I simply grabbed my broom and rags from my closet and set to cleaning. Everyone is grateful to have me back, I know. And the best part is that nobody minds my radio. I bring it with me everywhere and keep the volume low enough not to disrupt the students. No one has ever complained. In fact, I suspect they like it.\n\nThe schoolhouse is not very big, but does require a lot of maintenance. The floors are always sticky and stained, so I spend most of my time mopping. Kids make messes – I guess that’s why I’m still in business. Sometimes I have to move things around to make sure I get every spot on the floor beautiful and clean, but I take pride in that.\n\nAnd the repairs! The school always needs tune-ups here and there, and I am happy to help. Some days I’m reconstructing a desk that broke as I whistle along with the radio, other times I handle more serious, structural issues. Days when I have work like this, I feel truly instrumental, like a cog in a larger machine. How could this school survive without me? It took me a long time, but I once again feel that I have purpose.\n\nThere is a larder behind the school that is full of preserved food. In lieu of payment, I am allowed to take as much food as I need. That arrangement is fine – what would I do with money anyway? I used to bring the food back to my home, just one field away from the school, but when I started sleeping in the basement no one seemed to notice. This school is special to me and I cannot leave it unguarded.\n\nWhen I am besieged with memories of my wife and baby, I turn up the volume on the radio to drown out such thoughts. It works for me every time.\n\nExcept this morning.\n\nBecause this morning, I woke up to dead silence.\n\nI frantically examined the radio to see what had happened. I honestly cannot tell you how many days in a row I have been using it. Did it simply live out its life and die naturally? I have spent the entire day trying to fix it. Most of this time, I have been crying. I am losing my mind without it.\n\nI have given myself until sundown. If I cannot fix it by then, I am going to take my life. I am writing this because the sunlight is starting to die and I know what my fate shall be.\n\nI have thought about taking one last walk through the halls of my school, saying goodbye to the students and teachers. I know I will be missed. But I cannot bring myself to leave this room. I cannot go anywhere knowing that my radio is dead in here.\n\nThere are no more tears in me. It feels now like I can’t catch my breath. I vomited what little food I had in my stomach and I am growing dizzy again, like I did after Nadja died. I am not long for this world.\n\nBut before I take my life, I have closed the door to this room and stuck a chair beneath the handle. It is the only room in the basement and has a small casement that lets in just enough light for me to see what I am doing. If anyone is kind enough to come looking for me, they should not be met with this gruesome sight. Perhaps they will see the door is blocked, smell my rotting body, and simply forget I ever existed.\n\nBut I have placed both my radio and this note outside the door. Kind sir, if you are reading this, I have one humble request: please fix it. Save my radio. It did not deserve to die in its sleep and I am ashamed that I cannot revive it.\n\nNow I am ready to join Nadja and little Ludmilla in heaven. I hope this school can find another janitor who loves and cares for it the way I do.\n\nThe hour is now. Do not forget my radio.\n\nStanislav\n\n\n\n\nWhen Mom zoomed back out, Olivia had tears in her eyes. “Thank you for sharing, Uncle Stephen,” Mom said, her voice choked. “I think we have enough.”\n\n“Wait!” Olivia chirped. “He said there’s more. What did you find?”\n\nBefore Great Uncle Stephen could open his mouth, the image disappeared. My jaw dropped. Was that it? What did Great Uncle Stephen see?\n\nI promptly remembered that there was a second disc. This one was unmarked, but I hoped it contained the rest of the interview.\n\nThere was no video, only audio. The voice that started up was Olivia’s.\n\n“Hi Miss Gerrity. I’m sorry about my mom, but she refused to record the rest of what my uncle was saying. But I asked him to continue and secretly recorded the story as a voice memo on my phone. I remember you said earlier this year that history is written by the people who win wars.” She sucked in a breath and commenced crying. “But everyone’s history is important, even if they are sad, pathetic people and even if they never won a single thing in their life. I haven’t slept through the night since I finished this project, but you have to hear what my uncle has to say.”\n\nThere were tears in my eyes, too. The sincerity of her words was beautiful. I was also flattered that she had remembered some trite phrase I threw around because it was what my history teachers said to me. \n\nBefore I got too sappy over it, the audio began again.\n\n“Fine,” came Mom’s frustrated voice. “If you want to hear the rest of the story, fine, but this is not appropriate for a school project.”\n\n“Let me finish,” Great Uncle Stephen snapped. “If it’s too much for you, help yourself to a snack in the kitchen. But Olivia wants to know what happened.”\n\nI heard her mother mumble something and walk away. Olivia and her uncle were alone. I imagined her looking at him expectantly. \n\n“So did you find the radio? Or did it get ruined when the school got blown up?”\n\nHe rasped and I heard the distinct click of a lighter. “That letter,” he began slowly, “had a date on it.”\n\n“What date?” she inquired hungrily.\n\n“It was dated two weeks before we started rebuilding the school.”\n\n“Didn’t you say the school had been destroyed like two years ago?”\n\n“Yes,” replied Great Uncle Stephen. “It had been.”\n\nThere was silence as I felt goosebumps on my arms. The images that came to my mind were almost too overwhelming to express, but Great Uncle Stephen put them into words effortlessly. Clearly he had spent his whole life thinking about it.\n\n“This man, this Stanislav, went to a vandalized, falling apart schoolhouse and cleaned up blood and rubble like it was spilled drinks and dust. He smiled at dead bodies in the hallway and believed they were smiling back at him because they liked his radio. He moved around corpses so he could sweep the ground under them. The roof was half collapsed, so when it rained, he must’ve gotten soaking wet but was so oblivious that he didn’t even feel a thing.” I could hear Olivia crying steadily. “I found the larder he was talking about. It was all pickled, preserved food that probably tasted like shit. Most of the stuff was moldy.”\n\n“Did – did you see the dead body?”\n\n“Yes. Hanging from the ceiling, but still amazingly… lifelike. He wasn’t rotting away.  This hadn’t happened years ago.”\n\n“Did he look peaceful?” she asked, a chord of desperation in her voice.\n\n“Couldn’t tell you. The smell was rank, and his face was blue and his eyes were bulging. Like this.” I imagined him demonstrating. \n\n“And the radio?” Olivia wept.\n\nI heard Great Uncle Stephen take a long drag of his cigarette. “It was there, alright. And it was still on.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"215":{"title":"My son's camera monitor alerted in the middle of the night. I checked it and saw my wife and son sitting on the bed. They weren't my wife and son.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/bsrmy5\/my_sons_camera_monitor_alerted_in_the_middle_of\/","flair":"Series","author":"RisingMac","selftext":"I'm a nurse and I currently work nights. It's a total drag but I'm hopeful I can go to days soon since some coworkers are planning retirements. Anyway, I was working one night when just after 3am my son's monitor alerted me to sound and movement. No big deal at all, he probably coughed loudly or sneezed or something. He's three now so he generally sleeps all night. I bring it up on my phone and I see him and my wife sitting on the bed. Again, no big deal. He might have cried out or gotten scared or something.\n\nI was about to close the app when I noticed they were acting strange, almost creepy. And when I say \"almost\" creepy, I mean creepy as balls. They were sitting on the bed together both of them just staring up at the camera with blank, emotionless stares. The night vision is black and white, so they had white, eerie looking eyes. They didn't move at all aside from their visible breathing, they just sat there staring at the camera.\n\nI close the app and give my wife a call to make sure everything is ok. I never get to call home on lunch so in a way this is kind of nice to get to talk to my family while at work.\n\nIt rings a couple times before she answers with a very groggy \"hello?\" It was like she was dead asleep when I called and she looked wide awake when on the camera.\n\n\"Hey. You guys ok?\"\n\n\"Huh? Yeah. Buddy (my son's nickname) came in like 15 minutes ago. Seemed scared so I said he could sleep with mama.\"\n\nI'm confused here since I saw them in his room a minute ago. Literally 60 seconds had passed since I closed the app and made the call.\n\n\"Wait, so you guys are in bed?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I fell back asleep right away. Everything ok? Everybody keeps waking me up.\" She's kind of annoyed.\n\n\"Hang on a sec.\" I put her on speaker and bring up the app, hoping I don't see it. When the app loads I get that pang of intense nervousness in my stomach that I haven't had in a long time, since I was a kid in school and realized while I was eating breakfast a paper or something was due that day and I hadn't done it. My heart leaps into my throat. My wife and son are sitting on his bed looking up at the camera, same emotionless stares.\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\n\"You guys are in bed right?\"\n\n\"Yeah, we're trying to sleep.\"\n\n\"Well I'm looking at his camera and I see you two sitting on his bed.\"\n\n\"Huh? No. We're in our bed.\"\n\n\"I know that's what you mean, but I'm looking at his bed and you two are in there.\"\n\n\"Hang on,\" she says. She's quiet for a sec while she brings up the camera on her phone. I hear this guttural, terrified gasp. Like she had sucked all the air in the room into her lungs filling them to capacity. I don't hear this kind of gasp from my wife often, usually only when she's truly afraid like during a jump scare in a movie or one time when we turned her back on our son for literally a second and he was down by the mailbox inches from the road. I hear rustling of sheets and the line goes dead.\n\nOf course now I'm absolutely terrified myself so I immediately call back. It goes to voicemail so I call again. I call again and again with no answer. Finally after about four minutes she calls me. I tell you that four minutes felt like 40 years.\n\n\"Hey, what's happening?!\" I ask.\n\nShe's absolutely hysterical and crying, I can't understand a word she says.\n\n\"Stop! Slow down for just a second,\" I say.\n\nShe slows down enough to explain they are in the car and driving to her parents. She looked at the camera and when she saw what was on it she got up and grabbed our son and rushed downstairs and out the door. Didn't even close the garage.\n\n\"Don't worry about it,\" I said. \"I'll drive by when I get off and close it.\" We live in a generally safe neighborhood so I'm not too concerned the door is up.\n\n\"You will not go in there!\" she says.\n\n\"Hell no,\" I return.\n\n\"Why are we on the camera?\" she asked. \"Is it a recording?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" I return. \"I'm gonna keep watching it and see if there's anything I can tell. Do our code words with Buddy.\"\n\nWe have code words because we're nerds. We've seen too many pod people and impostor movies, so we decided a long time ago to make code words with each other to be able to tell if one of us was an impostor. We have a couple code words, but we also have a three sentence story we recite together, each saying a different part alternately of each other. I hear her on the phone saying the things we taught our son, he giggles as he says them (he does every time we practice) since he thinks they're a joke and doesn't have any idea of the real meaning. We're both convinced he's our son. My wife then says our part and I'm convinced she's her. We made up these words as a complete joke to ourselves. I never once in my life ever imagined we'd actually need them. Unreal.\n\nShe got to her parents safely and it was hard to hang up. I told her we'll figure it out in the morning, hopefully just a glitch. She said she didn't think it was a glitch. When she was running out she had to run by our son's room and the door was open. There's a little flashing light on the back of the camera that indicates its connected to the internet. It gives off just enough light that when she ran by she thought she saw, out of the corner of her eye, a shadowy outline of what could have been an adult sitting on our son's bed. It sends chills down my spine to think about.\n\nKnowing they were safe and out of the house is the only thing that kept me at work that night. It was a long four hours but I kept checking the camera every chance I got. Sure enough, they were still sitting on the bed staring up at the camera with emotionless gazes.\n\nI studied them to see if I could see any pattern, from their breathing to their blinking. Their breathing was steady and looked normal, it was their blinking that would tell me if this was just some kind of bizarre, time looped freak accident video or not. I intently stare at my phone and count the seconds between each blink, telling myself if this is a loop then their blinks should be even and occur at the same time each time.\n\nThere was no pattern to their blinking, it was erratic and random, just as a person blinking should be. The passing hours are what finally sealed the deal that this was not a weird looped video of some kind. My son's window is visible on camera and I can see on camera that it is getting lighter outside his room. His curtains keep out just enough light to prevent the camera from exiting night vision, but lets in just enough to be able to tell the sun is rising.\n\nI try to figure out what the hell I'm going to do before I leave work. Calling the police comes to mind, but I talk myself out of it. First of all what am I supposed to say? Someone is in my house that looks like my wife but isn't? Worse yet, what if they \\*are\\* entities of some kind and the police do go over and it kills them or something.\n\nI decide to tell coworker about it. He's a firm believer in the paranormal and might have a suggestion. I show him the video and tell him the story. His initial response of \"that's creepy as fuck\" doesn't help much, but he says he wants to go over and check it out. He says we both should to see if Not-My-Wife will try and act like my wife. I tell him absolutely not and he says we should at least go to the house even if we don't go in. I agree on that since I wanted to close the garage.\n\nWe got to my house and walked around the perimeter first. Not sure what we wanted to accomplish by that, but it felt like something we should do. The curtains were all drawn since nobody was there to open them in the morning, so we couldn't see anything. I went to close the garage and suddenly had this overwhelming urge to go inside and investigate, it was like I just had to know what was going on. So in we went.\n\nWe walked through the kitchen towards the foyer where the stairs are. It's so quiet in our house right now you could hear a feather drop, forget the pin. We stop at the bottom of the stairs and wait a few seconds. I look at the camera again and they are still sitting there. I've never been so scared in my life. My coworker puts his foot on the first step and I suddenly say \"stop\" loudly.\n\n\"Forget this, we're outta here,\" I tell him. \"Come on,\" I start making my way back to the kitchen.\n\nWe hear a loud creak in the floor from upstairs. It's my son's room. He has a very loud, creaky board right in the middle of his floor that's almost impossible not to step on. My wife and are still deciding if we ever want to fix it because it will alert us if he's ever up to no good when he gets older trying to sneak out or something.\n\n\"Come on, come on, COME ON!\" I yell as I motion for him to move his ass. We're out of the house in about two seconds. Out on the street I check my phone. Now only Not-My-Son was sitting on the bed, same blank stare. Not-My-Wife was gone.\n\n\"Holy shit!\" my coworker says,\n\n\"That was stupid as fuck of us. Do NOT tell my wife we went inside.\" She would be so ungodly mad if she found out what we just did.\n\nI use my garage door opener in my car to close the door. Before we leave I look at the camera again. Not-My-Wife is back on the bed with Not-My-Son, both staring blankly up at the camera, blinking every few seconds.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThat was all about four days ago now. Not-My-Wife and Not-My-Son are still sitting on the bed staring up at the camera. They haven't moved a millimeter. We obviously haven't gone back to our house. What do we do?\n\n\\---\n\n[Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/c6j9rp\/my_sons_camera_monitor_alerted_in_the_middle_of\/)"},"216":{"title":"A Package Marked “Return to sender”","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/5j6p8x\/a_package_marked_return_to_sender\/","flair":null,"author":"manen_lyset","selftext":"My neighbor is one of those annoying wannabe YouTube personalities. Over the years, I’ve seen him cough out cinnamon, lay flat on the hood of his car as it slowly creeps down the driveway, and douse himself in lukewarm water, all the while screaming *epic win*, *epic fail*, or, fuck, *epic maintenance of the status quo*, for all I know. It can get tiring to watch him go about his shenanigans in the pursuit of viral fame. So, when he knocked on my door the other day, told me he was going away for a few weeks, and asked that I get his mail, honestly, it was a relief. I can’t explain the peace of mind I had knowing I didn’t have to brace myself for any of his stupidity for a while. I was always afraid his stunts would wind up bleeding over into my life.\n\nThings were pretty normal for the first couple of days. He received a few bills, a bit of spam, and what I could only assume was a birthday card. Then, one evening, I got home to find a cardboard box waiting on his front porch. In big red letters was written “Return to Sender”.\n\nI’m no small fry, but I admit I had trouble lifting the box on my own. It was really freaking heavy. Lugging it across the road to my house was even harder, and I quickly realized there was no way I was going to drag it up the stairs and through my front door. I decided I’d leave his package in my garage. It wasn’t like I kept my car in there: the garage door was a piece of shit that refused to open without a good thug and a whack. It was less trouble just leaving the car in the driveway than it was to fight with the garage door every morning and night. In hindsight, I should have set the package down while I struggled to open the tricky door, but you know how it is when you’ve got a good grip on something, no point in setting it down if you don’t have to.\n\nIt was as I kicked the door for a third time that I lost my grip on the package, and it fell to the ground. I heard a light crack inside.\n\n“Shit,” I cursed.\n\nI hoped I hadn’t broken anything important, but figured I just wouldn’t tell my neighbor about it and let him assume the break happened en-route.\n\nHands free, I finally managed to get the garage door unstuck, and boy did it screech in protest as it rolled up and over me. I dragged the box the rest of the way, setting it in the corner for whenever my neighbor would come back to claim it. And then, I forgot all about it. Until a few days passed, that is.\n\nI’m not sure exactly how long it took for the smell to waft in from the crack under the garage-to-house door, but it came in in slow progression. It was a sickly sweet odor similar to a skunk, and for the first few days after I smelled it, I genuinely assumed that’s exactly what it was: roadkill that had left its mark on my house. It was only when I realized the scent was growing more intense instead of fading that I went looking for a source. That’s when I opened the garage door, and that’s when the odor knocked me back, holding my nose.\n\nThe culprit wasn’t hard to identify. The only change in my garage was the box in the corner. I remember thinking it must have been one of those meat-of-the-month subscription boxes. The meat must have gone rancid from being left out of the fridge for so long. How much meat could have been in there for the box to have been so large and heavy? An entire freaking cow?\n\nI covered my nose as I approached the box, a pair of scissors in my hands. I probably wouldn’t have needed them to open it, as it had become soggy enough at the bottom to poke through with a finger, but I wasn’t about to poke my finger into spoiled meat juices. That soggy bottom was the reason I had to open the box in the first place. If I tried to drag it out whole, everything would spill onto the floor. I was going to have to dump the pieces of meat one garbage bag at a time, and take them down to the dumpster, a process I wasn’t looking forward to.\n\nMy scissors tore through the tape along the top of the cardboard box. I thought the smell couldn’t get any worse, but as I flipped the flaps open, I discovered a whole new gamut of stink. It was like opening a burning oven, but instead of a heat wave, I was met with waves of piss, sweat, shit, and putrefaction. It was so bad that I staggered back and had to force down the puke begging to guzzle out of me. I don’t think I could have handled that scent mingling with the horrors coming out of the box. I’m not ashamed to admit I ran out the door for a breath of fresh air, but in the short time I’d spent in the garage, the smell had become so ingrained in the fabric of my clothes that it clung to me like a shadow.\n\nNothing I tried could keep the smell out of my nostrils. Not air fresheners, not a face mask, not three showers and a change of clothes. Every second that box lay open in my garage was another second the smell was allowed a foothold into my home. I had to bite the bullet.\n\nI returned to the garage, the flaps of the box still open as though inviting me to look. I was prepared, a clothespin pinning my nostrils shut, a garbage bag in one hand, the strongest cleaner I could find in the other, and long rubber gloves to keep my skin from having to touch what was inside. But, as it turns out, I needed none of those things.\n\nI wouldn’t have to touch or clean the contents of that box, I would only have to suffer the nightmares every night. You see, there was meat in that box, but it didn’t come from a cow or a pig. No, it was worse than that. It was my neighbor. Dead. Still in one piece, but dead.\n\nI called the cops, and naturally, they took me in for interrogation. It’s kind of hard *not* to suspect the man with a corpse in his garage, after all. Thankfully, they soon realized I wasn’t involved. My DNA might have been all over that box, the smell might have left a mark throughout my house, but there was one piece of irrefutable evidence in my neighbor’s own hands that proved my innocence: a vlogging camera.\n\nThey showed me the footage only once. I’m not sure if they were allowed to, or if they felt so bad for me they figured it couldn’t hurt. Either way, I saw it.\n\nMy neighbor was sitting in the box outside of a shipping facility, laughing as he told the world how he was going to mail himself across state lines. He’d brought pee bottles, food, a pillow, and a few flashlights. His friend – a guy I’d seen at his place several times to help with his stunts –, closed the lid and presumably dropped him off for shipment. Throughout the next couple of hours…or days, I’m honestly not sure, my neighbor recorded a few short clips about his progress. ‘I think I’m in a truck now, I can feel it moving’, ‘Must be in a warehouse. Pretty warm here. Still got plenty of food!’, that kind of stuff. And then, on the last entry, the box toppled over. He broke his neck, and that was it. The camera recorded until either the memory card got too full, or the battery died.\n\nThere’s one thing I didn’t tell the police after they showed me the video. One thing I heard in the footage that will haunt me to the day I die. Just after the tumble that broke his neck, I heard the familiar screeching sound of *my* garage door.\n\n***\n[ML](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/lyset.manen)"},"217":{"title":"How do I get my girlfriend to knock off this annoying habit?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/bfg42c\/how_do_i_get_my_girlfriend_to_knock_off_this\/","flair":null,"author":"queen_of_the_moths","selftext":"So I've been dating my girlfriend for almost a year, and last month, we moved in together. Maybe that's kind of fast. I don't know. My parents sure thought it was. But honestly, everything was great in the beginning. We get along really well, and we've never had more than a brief argument. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut then she started whistling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's so dumb, I know, but she's always whistling this weird song, and it really gets on my nerves. My mom kept telling me that once you move in with someone, you discover all of the quirks they'd been hiding from you, and it's not like I didn't expect that to be true. But for some reason, this is just an ongoing issue with us, and I don't know what to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt first I would just hear her whistling it when she was showering. It was kind of cute, like her own little bathroom theme song. I didn't recognize the melody, but it was very distinct. I could mimic it from memory if I wanted to. In fact, sometimes it gets stuck in my head, and it drives me a little crazy. You know the type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter a week or so, I asked her what the song was, and she just laughed. I'm wondering if maybe she came up with it on her own, something that she does absently, especially once she started doing it more. Like I'd be reading a book, and she'd be on the computer, and she'd just start whistling. And I tried to ignore it. I seriously feel like a dick for being so grumpy about it, and I know she wasn't doing it to annoy me. But she'd just go on and on, and it would pull my attention away from whatever I was doing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I finally said something a few nights ago. I was going over some legal documents for work, and she just starts whistling like crazy, on and on. And I'm trying to just block it out, but it's seriously excessive. Like, I know you guys are probably thinking that I was overreacting, but it felt like she was whistling right into my ear, and it just frayed my last bit of patience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs calmly and nicely as I could, I called out to her and asked her to quiet down. She didn't reply. I asked her again, and she still didn't answer, so I left the bedroom and found her in the living room, watching a movie. She wasn't whistling anymore, and for some reason, that really irked me. It felt like she was messing with me. And she just looked over at me, like she didn't know what my deal was.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI asked her if she could stop whistling so much, and she told me she wasn't whistling. Now, I get that maybe she doesn't realize she's doing it, but no one whistles *that* much and doesn't notice. It's not really like her to mess with me like that, and I don't know what she's trying to get out of this. I thought maybe she was teasing or playing a joke, but she had to see how annoyed I was. I asked her again to just not whistle so loudly, and she didn't answer. There was tension in the room, and it felt like our first fight since moving in together. Even though she didn't whistle for the rest of the night, I couldn't focus on my work anyway because I was upset about the confrontation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen, of course, the next night she was whistling again. I hear her when she comes home from work, and she keeps going for at least an hour. I didn't want to have another fight, so I just hung out in the bedroom and listened to her move around for a while. I felt like I was blowing things out of proportion, but honestly, how hard is it to just not whistle all the time? It was no big deal when it was now and then, but I feel like she whistles more than she even talks to me now. So I'm sitting up in the room, thinking about that, and that's probably why I was worked up when I finally came down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe was cooking dinner, which is sweet, but she was still whistling. So I said, softly, \"Hey honey, maybe we should put on some music instead, so you don't have to fill the silence with whistling.\" I tried to play it off like a joke, but I knew she'd probably see through it and get annoyed again. She didn't even turn to face me, just huffed and kept cooking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter a minute, I told her I was sorry about the other night, but the whistling just sort of strikes my ear wrong, and if she could try not to whistle so much and so loudly, it would make my life a lot easier. I feel like I was being fair. I know it seems controlling and nit picky, but it was bothering me a lot. We all have our things, you know? I try not to chew loudly at the table because it bothers her, so why can't she just stop whistling sometimes for me?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut she totally freaked out. She turned around and told me she wasn't whistling and she didn't know what my problem was. At this point, I don't get why she was doing this. It obviously wasn't funny for either of us, and she seemed genuinely upset, so I don't know why she kept provoking me. I asked her what her deal was, why she was so defensive about the stupid whistling, and she told me to shut up. She told me she was sick of talking about it, like *I* was the one being unreasonable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI never get mad at her, but I just snapped. I told her to stop whistling before I lost my mind. She called me crazy, just because I was getting a little upset, and somehow, that was all I could take. I grabbed one of the cast iron pans from the stove and swung it at her head as hard as I could.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe fell over and smashed her head on the counter, but I swung the pan again before she hit the ground. I think I hit her maybe three or four times. I don't remember, but I feel horrible. There was blood everywhere, and her jaw might be broken. No, I think it is for sure. I couldn't believe I'd lost my temper like that, and I have no idea how we can move past this. I feel so ashamed for letting things get physical, regardless of how much she might have been provoking me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut here's the kicker. She's STILL FUCKING WHISTLING. And I asked her nicely to please stop, but now she won't even pause! For two days she's just been lying on the kitchen floor with her eyes rolled back and her mouth hanging open, just marinating in congealed blood, and she's STILL FUCKING WHISTLING. I don't know what to do. I don't want to break up, but this is just too much. I just need her to shut up. Just shut up. Just shut up. Just shut up. JUST SHUT UP."},"218":{"title":"I had a disturbing conversation with my 7-year-old daughter.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/fiz4d0\/i_had_a_disturbing_conversation_with_my_7yearold\/","flair":null,"author":"samhaysom","selftext":"\"Dad, *dad*! I saw a *zombie*!\"\n\nI was in the kitchen making tea when my little girl came rushing in. She ran through the back door so fast she almost tripped up the step. I poured boiling water from the kettle into a mug, hardly looking up.\n\n\"Oh yeah?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I did! Its face was all pale and messed up! It was *gross*, dad!\"\n\nI put the kettle back and picked up the milk. Sighed inwardly. I *really* had to be more careful about what I watched on TV in the evening. Rosie has a habit of sneaking downstairs in the night, and last week she caught me watching *The Walking Dead*, of all things. She's had zombies on the brain ever since. I keep telling her they're not real, but it doesn't seem to make a difference.\n\n\"Sweetheart, what did we say about zombies?\" I scooped the teabag out of the mug and dumped it in the bin. \"You know if you keep talking about them, daddy's going to get in trouble with mummy again.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but I *saw* one.\"\n\n\"I know, darling, but I already checked the back garden twice yesterday, and I can promise you it's a zombie-free zone.\"\n\n\"No, not in the back garden.\"\n\n\"Hm?\"\n\n\"I didn't see it in the back garden.\"\n\nI had the mug half raised to my lips, but now I put it down again. I turned to look at Rosie. Her hair was wind-swept and her little cheeks were red, as if she'd been running.\n\n\"Sweetheart.\" I put on my best stern, dad's-not-happy voice. \"I'm going to ask you a question, and I want you to be honest with me: Have you been playing along the path out back again?\"\n\nI didn't really need to ask the question, because I already knew the answer. Rosie is allowed to play in the garden on her own, and sometimes – if she asks us permission first – we let her ride her bike along the path at the back of our house. The one that runs past all the neighbour's back gardens. But that's *all* we allow her to do. This area is pretty safe, but these days you can never be too careful. There was a burglary a couple of roads over a few months back, and last year someone was mugged on the high street. Several years ago, a few towns over, a little boy even went missing. That was quite a long way away from here, of course, but it made national news for a few days until the search fizzled out. And it made a lot of parents more cautious. Rosie's getting older now, and she's an adventurous girl, but still – you have to have boundaries. And on a few occasions lately, Rosie's been crossing those boundaries. Riding her bike further than she should. Not coming in straight away when we call her. Sneaking out the back gate when she's only meant to be playing in the garden.\n\nAs I watched Rosie now, I noticed her face growing redder. She looked away from me, down at the kitchen floor, and scuffed her feet.\n\n\"Dad, I only went a *little* way down,\" she said. \"I *promise*. I was chatting to Mr Henderson, because I saw him in his back garden. I said hello and made him jump!\"\n\nI sighed. So there it was: Mr Henderson was Rosie's zombie. Yesterday it was the postman, and the day before that it was a different neighbour. I took a sip of tea and shook my head. Mr Henderson was, in fairness, a better candidate than the others. The guy lives on his own, and he looks about 100 years old. Moles all over his face. Skin like a deflated balloon. Whenever we'd chatted over the garden fence before, though, he'd always seemed nice enough. Just a bit lonely. I couldn't have Rosie going round calling him a zombie.\n\n\"Listen to me, sweetheart. I know you didn't go far or anything, but I don't want you–\"\n\n\"I came right back after too, dad!\" Rosie interrupted. She was staring up at me now, blue eyes large and pleading. \"I promise! And I even said no when Mr Henderson offered me an ice cream, because I know you don't like me taking stuff from strangers!\"\n\nI opened my mouth to respond, then paused. \"He offered you ice cream?\"\n\n\"Yeah, but I said no! Mr Henderson really wanted me to come in and have one, but I told him I had to get home! And then I came straight back here to tell you I'd seen a zombie, and I...\"\n\nRosie was babbling now, her voice whirring like a motor. But I'd stopped listening. My mind was still stuck on something she'd said a moment before.\n\n*Mr Henderson really wanted me to come in and have one*.\n\nI took another sip of tea and frowned. That wasn't good. I didn't mind the neighbours chatting to my little girl, but I didn't like the thought of them inviting her in. Not without us there. Not even if they were just kind, lonely old men. I made up my mind to go round and visit Mr Henderson later, and to tell him that myself – kindly, of course, but firmly. \n\nIn the end, though, I didn't get a chance. Because a few moments after I'd had the thought, Rosie said something else. Something that pushed everything else from my mind, and ended any idea I might have had about going over to Mr Henderson's house. She said something that made me feel cold.\n\n\"Daddy, please don't stop me playing in the garden. I *promise* I won't sneak out again. I don't want the zombie to get me.\"\n\n\"Rosie, I'm not going to stop you playing in the garden. But you have to make *me* a couple of promises, too. First, promise me you'll stop going round calling people zombies. Mr Henderson my be old, but he's not one of the living dead.\"\n\nRosie frowned. \"I didn't.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, you didn't? You just ran in here a moment ago calling him one.\"\n\n\"No, I *didn't*. Mr Henderson's not a zombie. I saw the zombie in his house, but it wasn't him.\"\n\nI frowned. I had the mug raised to my lips to take another sip of tea, but now I put it down again. \"What do you mean, sweetheart? You saw someone else in his house?\"\n\n\"Yeah, the *zombie*, dad! I could see it pressed against his little basement window while I was talking to him.\"\n\nCold fingers ran up my spine. \"What?\"\n\n\"Yeah, it was *really* scary. Its face was all bashed up and bloody, and its mouth was open. Like it was screaming at me. But do you know what confused me most, dad?\"\n\nI tried to keep my voice steady. \"What?\"\n\n\"Well, I didn't realise *kids* could be zombies, too. I thought it was only grownups. But I guess I must have have been wrong, cuz' the one in Mr Henderson's basement looked [just like a little boy](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/samhaysom\/comments\/aow1eb\/stories_and_links\/).\""},"219":{"title":"Maria on the Moon","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/eswqyf\/maria_on_the_moon\/","flair":null,"author":"Grand_Theft_Motto","selftext":"“Did you know that early astronomers thought there were oceans on the moon?” I asked, looking up from my book.\n\nMy mom shifted in her bed, a tangle of IV tubes shifting with her. “Of course. The moon seems like the perfect place to find an ocean.”\n\n“What a shame we never found water then,” I said. “Because those false seas, astronomers called them ‘maria.’”\n\nMom smiled. “How sweet of them to name the moon oceans after me.”\n\n“Well, they didn’t find any oceans,” I reminded her.\n\n“Maybe they just didn’t look hard enough,” she replied, a little laugh slipping from her lips.\n\nFor all of the pain she was in, all of the fear she must feel, my mother always had the kind of laugh that could light a candle. We were in her hospital room, the same one we’d been in and out of for the last year and a half. Sometimes we had a roommate, sometimes we were alone. Always she held steady enough for both of us, the rock I tied my hope to, the wall against the grief I knew was coming.\n\nCancer is such a mundane word for something so hungry and cruel. I’ve noticed medicine does that a lot, covers horror with tedious language like a bed sheet over a body.\n\n*Malignant. Inoperable. Metastasized. Terminal.*\n\nBut when she laughed...when she laughed we weren’t in the hospital anymore, we were home. When she laughed, she wasn’t sick, she was young again, and I was a kid, and the world was a bright place begging to be explored. What a miracle my mother was. Cancer had taken so much from her, aged and hurt her, but it could never steal her laugh. That was hers to keep.\n\n“How are we feeling today?” the doctor asked. He came in less and less often. We could all sense this was the final stay in this room.\n\n“Just brilliant, doc,” my mom said, struggling to sit a little higher. “We can still go dancing later if you’d like. Though we’ll have to ask for my son’s blessing. Ever since his dad died, Brian’s been very protective of me.”\n\nI put on a stern face. “I’ll need to know your intentions are pure, Dr. Bradshaw.”\n\n“As the driven snow,” he played along. “But I might need a raincheck on the dance, Ms. Willen. I’m not as young as I used to be.”\n\nHe emphasized his age, running his fingers through grey-white hair. My mom tapped her bare scalp.\n\n“Right there with you, tiger,” she said.\n\nDr. Bradshaw smiled but I could tell he was burdened. I saw him glance at the small idol I’d placed on my mother’s nightstand. The talisman was a miniature oak tree carved from gray soapstone. There were four faces etched into the tree, a sentry against ill health and bitter spirits. I could tell the stone tree made the doctor uncomfortable. In all honesty, I had a tough time looking at the idol for more than a few seconds. The faces were each whittled in vivid expression. The face closest to my mother’s bed was smiling kindly and the face pointed towards the door was snarling, meant to ward away harm.\n\nThe final two faces were both weeping. All four shapes were too human, too raw. There was a *weirdness* to the stone tree that put people on edge but I’d grown used to every shade of weird you can imagine. My mother’s side of the family was full of stories of unexplained luck and mysterious tragedy, whispered secrets and unexplained deaths. By all accounts, my maternal grandmother was either an honest-to-goodness witch or full-bore, high-caliber crazy, or both. *Probably* both.\n\nThe stone tree was from a box of my grandmother’s things I’d found in the attic earlier that month. Maybe it was just a coincidence, but my mom did seem to get a bit better when I’d brought in the talisman, at least for a little while.\n\nI was daydreaming about family history and the odd box while Dr. Bradshaw checked his charts and mom’s vitals.\n\n“Can I talk to you for a moment?” he asked, ripping me back to reality. Dr. Bradshaw tried to keep a light tone but I could tell he didn’t have good news.\n\nThe hospital hallway smelled like ammonia and birthday cake. Someone must have had a party, maybe a patient, maybe a nurse. Strange how you remember the insignificant details while your world is crashing down around you.\n\n“I’m so sorry,” Dr. Bradshaw told me. “The results came in this morning. It’s spreading aggressively. We...we held it back as long as we could, Brian. Your mom is a fighter. But right now we just need to, well, to try to keep her as comfortable as we can. Brian?”\n\nThe wall was cracking, grief waiting on the other side, heavy and cold as an empty house. I’d known for months that this was the most likely outcome but it still hurt to hear. Hurt worse than I could stomach.\n\n“There’s nothing left to try?” I asked, fighting down the urge to throw up. “Anything, experimental, untested, anything?”\n\nDr. Bradshaw shook his head. “I’m sorry. Sometimes we just run out of options. She fought a good fight.”\n\n“How long does she have left?” I asked, looking back into her room. She’d fallen asleep.\n\n“Not long. Maybe days. Have you considered hospice?”\n\nThe smell of ammonia and birthday cake. The steady beep of mom’s heart monitor. I tried to focus on the world around me. My hope wasn’t dead yet. If medicine couldn’t help my mom, maybe something older could. I thought of the box of my grandmother’s things waiting in the attic. There was a lot in there I hadn’t gone through yet, books and candles and secrets and lost things. Maybe there was a cure or at least a way to keep the fight going.\n\n“No,” I said. “If all that’s left is to make her comfortable, I want to take her home.”\n\nThe doctor smiled. “I understand. We can give you some medication, ways to help her with the pain.” He put his hand on my shoulder. “Your mom’s been in a lot of pain but she’ll have peace, soon. You’ve done all you can.”\n\n“I know,” I lied. “Thank you.”\n\nMom lived in a small ranch house ten miles outside of town. There wasn’t much in the way of neighbors besides some woods and a creek slithering through her yard. It was a windy, warm March afternoon when I took my dying mother home. That night I began my work. I was going to turn the house into a bunker, a maze Death could never solve. I would keep my mother safe, I would find a way to keep her alive.\n\nThe little red book was full of ideas. Running water was an obvious place to start. The creek behind the house was barely a trickle but it should provide some coverage to the south side of the property. Salt was next, lining the doorways and window frames, then in an unbroken circle around the entire house. This step was to be repeated daily, the red book stressed, or even multiple times per day. Even a moderate breeze played holy havoc with any salt poured outside so it was always best to trace and retrace every few hours. Water and salt were common defenses against man’s oldest enemy and well known. The book offered other, less conventional, advice.\n\nIt took me nearly a week to finish carving the symbols and signs into the walls, the floors, even the trees on the property. Sometime around noon on the third day, on my back in the crawlspace etching strange marks onto the underside of the floor, it struck me how ridiculous I was acting. There was no proof that any of the information in the little red book was anything other than the delusional ramblings of a bizarre woman I’d only met once or twice as a child. For all I knew, the runes meant to ward off Death were actually a grocery list written in Cantonese. But I was desperate, and every time I saw my mother she looked frailer, more fragile. So I continued carving and praying and building layers upon layers of protections to keep Death far away.\n\nMaking my marks took me all over the property. It was a big yard, nearly three acres that blended gradually into the surrounding forest. I wasn’t able to pinpoint the exact boundary where cultivated met nature, the edges simply bled together, but I did my best to create a clean border with lines between the symbols. I’d always loved the wildness here, the way you could wander a few hundred yards away from home and feel like you’d traveled hundreds of years into the past to somewhere primal. This was the perfect playground for a kid, whether I was out exploring trails or trapping minnows or spending the summer building yet another treehouse, convinced this would be the final one. It never was, I was never satisfied.\n\nThe house itself, though small, was more than enough room for my mother and me. Dad died when I was seven. I don’t remember much about him, just how big he seemed, with a bonfire grin and arms that I thought could hold the whole world. My mom often said I took after my father. I could see it in the old pictures of him, we had the same eyes, green as moss in the summer, and the same fiery shock of red hair, enemy to every comb on the planet. The sicker mom got the more often she called me by my father’s name. I worried when she drifted away like that but a part of me was proud she’d mistake me for him.\n\nAfter all of the symbols were carved there were a few steps left in the book to deter Death from visiting. There were dozens of charms and talismans in the bottom of the old box in the attic. I sat up there combing through everything my grandmother left behind, referencing the red book, pushing the tiny charms into tidy piles. None of the idols were larger than my thumb. Some were iron and others were wood, some were heavy, others light. All of them were uncomfortable to look at or touch.\n\nThe attic was drafty but not nearly enough to explain the cold that burrowed into me as I sorted the charms. I’m not particularly tall but the attic felt like it was designed for dolls, beams so low I couldn’t even walk bent over. I moved around on my knees, rough floorboards threatening splinters even through my jeans. I could have taken the box downstairs where I’d have more room but the idea filled me with a deep unease. It seemed better to leave the box up in the attic, only taking down objects as I needed them. Up here, at least, my grandmother’s items, her legacy was...quarantined.\n\nThe red book was very specific about the distribution of the totems around the house and property. I walked carefully through my mom’s backyard, boots plopping in and out of mud, compass in hand. It had rained nearly every day since I’d taken my mom home from the hospital. I knew it was almost certainly a coincidence but couldn’t help wonder if the soft curtains of rain falling to the ground were for her. I placed charms in a compass rose with the house in the middle. The most disturbing objects were given places of honor at each cardinal direction.\n\nWater, salt, wards, charms, all placed carefully, intentionally. My grandmother’s book promised that these would offer some degree of protection against the inevitability of Death. The symbols would confuse it, the talismans distract it, and the water and salt make barriers to slow it down. But Death might still find a crack to slip through, so the red book recommended one final trick.\n\nThere was a small candle in the bottom of the box, dirty white as stained paper. When I took the candle from its case the smell made me gag. Have you ever walked past a portable toilet in the dog days of summer? When it’s so hot, the blue plastic has started to warp and bubble? Imagine that smell distilled into a finger’s worth of wax. I brought the candle downstairs, placed it on the dining room table and set it alight.\n\nThe wick caught immediately, the flame burning an unusual red-brown. No heat came off of the candle and it actually seemed cooler the closer I moved my hand to the fire. Once the wax began to melt the smell was ten times worse than it was back in the attic. I choked down a greasy sickness crawling up my throat and quickly left the room, shutting the French doors as I went. That helped trap the odor but I couldn’t shake the sense of nausea. I went to check on my mother.\n\n“Do you remember the day you ran away?” my mom asked, sitting in her bed, lunch untouched on the nightstand beside her.\n\nI didn’t think she had any weight left to lose before she was nothing but bone and memory. Her skin was rice paper over a frame that seemed smaller every day. Her eyes, though, no matter how fragile the rest of her became, remained two little lanterns against the dark, blue and bright and alive.\n\n“I didn’t make it very far,” I answered. “And I wasn’t really running away, only...stretching my legs.”\n\nMom smiled. “You told me you were leaving for the circus. You wanted to be either a lion tamer or a strongman or maybe a fire-eater.”\n\n“I think I wanted to be all of that combined. Young me was big on multitasking.”\n\nMy mother turned so she was looking out the window into the yard. “I was so scared when I found your note, the one saying you were leaving. My hands were shaking like you wouldn’t believe when I called the sheriff and then Mr. Jonas down the way. It felt like we were searching for you for half the night, even though it couldn’t have been more than an hour before we found you there, lost in the woods, wandering around and shivering. You hadn’t even brought a jacket.”\n\nI sat next to my mom on the bed. “Yeah, I didn’t exactly plan ahead for my circus escape. I remember...I remember getting over the idea real quick but I couldn’t find my way back. I’m glad you found me.”\n\n“I’m glad, too,” my mother said and I noticed her wipe away a tear. “I’m so glad. That hour you were gone, Brian, that was the most afraid I’ve ever been. Afraid we wouldn’t find you, afraid you might be hurt or worse. I couldn’t hardly breathe through the fear. Then, suddenly, you were there and the relief nearly knocked me over. I think we stayed up together the rest of the night watching the stars. I wanted to make sure you could find the North Star in case you ever got lost again.”\n\nShe turned back to me, reached out her thin hand and placed it over mine. There were still tears in her eyes but she smiled her lighthouse smile and, for a moment, I saw her just as she used to be, just as she was the night I ran away and my mom found me.\n\nI squeezed her hand. “I was scared, too. I was afraid I’d be stuck out there. What made you think of it?”\n\n“Well, I’ve been thinking a lot about dying lately and-”\n\n“Don’t,” I interrupted. “Don’t talk like that. You’re not going anywhere, not for a long time.”\n\n“It’s okay,” she said, squeezing my hand back. “It’s okay. I’ve known real fear and what I’m feeling now...it’s not like that. I’m scared, I guess, but I’m at peace with it. I had such a beautiful life. I’m so glad I got to meet you, to be your mom.”\n\n“I’m glad, too,” I whispered, voice breaking on the last word.\n\n*But I won’t let you go without a fight,* I added silently in my mind.\n\nSomething was trying to get to my mom. The strangeness began the day after I lit the candle. At first it was small blips, tiny *wrongs* that I chalked up to my imagination. Doors I knew I’d closed at night were open in the morning. Food began to rot and spoil within days of me bringing it into the house. Eventually, food would go bad almost immediately. Every few hours the television in the living room would either turn off if it was running, or on if it was off.\n\nClocks would stop overnight, always at 3:03 am. Shadows began *sticking* to the corners of rooms independent of any light sources. The shadows were stubborn and they would linger for as long as I would stare, then disappear when I blinked. I began hearing bumps and knocks at all hours and sometimes, when I’d enter an empty room, I had a sharp, fleeting certainty that it was only just occupied.\n\nI avoided the dining room except to check in twice a day to see if the candle was still burning. The smell was vicious and would claw its way into your throat and nostrils the moment it was given a chance. I kept the door to the room shut and kept air fresheners running in the surrounding rooms 24\/7. The funny thing was, the candle never went out, never even seemed to shrink. I could see the wax melting but day-in and day-out the candle refused to change.\n\nDays marched into weeks and the wrongness only grew deeper. My mom and I both lost sleep to vivid nightmares that we couldn’t remember when we woke up. Only the echoes remained but those were enough to leave my pulse sprinting until morning. I started sleeping in a chair in my mother’s room. I did this to comfort her if she woke up confused during the night but also because, if I’m being honest, I was too scared to sleep alone. I felt like a child running into his parents’ room, convinced there was a monster under the bed. Thing is...maybe there was.\n\nBy the third week I couldn’t keep doors closed. They would slam open the moment I left the room. A terrible scratching began inside of the walls. I told my mom it might be squirrels or mice but the sound was so insistent, not like rodents milling about, more like a dog wanting in. I stopped leaving the house for supplies; instead, I had what little food we ate delivered. I kept the curtains drawn. There was tapping on the glass every night.\n\nAbout a month after leaving the hospital we were living like zombies. The dining room couldn’t contain the smell of the candle anymore. The entire house was clogged with the scent. Tiny noises had graduated into full-on laughs and screams and whispers in the rooms around us. Something kicked the bathroom door so hard while I was taking a shower that the hinges warped. I covered every mirror in the house. I’d started to see things in the corners looking back at me, half-hidden faces, shapes that skittered away as soon as I turned around. Mom was drifting further and further away. She had long moments of confusion where she’d forget my name, forget where we were. Sometimes, she’d think I was my dad. Other times, she’d just stare at the wall for hours, growing fainter and fainter each day like a Polaroid left in the sun.\n\nBut she was alive.\n\nIt was clear that we were under siege by something. My world shrank to only one room and every trip to the bathroom or to answer the door for food felt like going over the trenches. The noises kept getting worse and worse, the shadows closer, the sense of movement around the house sharper. Every now and then I would feel hot breath on the back of my neck or walk through a cold patch hanging in the air. I stopped bothering redrawing the lines of salt around the house. I knew, deep in my bones, that as long as the sickly candle burned, Death could not take my mom away.\n\nOn the thirty-third day after leaving the hospital, I woke with a start from a nightmare, only to find my mom’s bed empty. She hadn’t been able to walk the past week at all, so my first feeling was hope that she might be improving, at least a little. Then I noticed the odor we’d been living with for weeks was gone.\n\n“Mom!” I shouted, running in bare feet out of the room.\n\nI found her in the dining room, the door wide open. She was standing at the table, frail as a neglected scarecrow, bobbing back and forth. Her hands were hovering over the candle. The flame was out.\n\n“Why did you do that?” I whispered. “Mom? Mom...are you okay?”\n\nI padded into the room, the wooden floor freezing cold. My mother didn’t react to my presence, she just continued rocking side-to-side. I realized she was still asleep.\n\n“Mom?” I gently shook her shoulder. “Wake up.”\n\nHer head snapped back and she nearly fell. I caught her on the way down. It felt like she weighed nothing at all.\n\n“What’s going on?” she asked, looking around the dark room. “Where…”\n\n“You’re okay,” I told her. “You were sleepwalking.”\n\n“I was having the most unusual dream,” mom mumbled. “There were so many stars and...”\n\nShe began to shiver uncontrollably. The cold hit me a moment later. I let out a gasp. The house was chilly before but the dining room was near-arctic. My breath bloomed into a thin cloud in front of my face. I became acutely aware of the complete silence filling the house.\n\nThen I heard scratching. It was coming all throughout the house, deep tearing sounds at the walls around the dining room. Footsteps came immediately after, heavy and fast. Somewhere in the house a window shattered.\n\n“Brian,” my mother said, holding onto me.\n\n“Don’t worry,” I said, “everything will be-”\n\nMy voice deserted me as a massive shadow unfolded in the corner of the room. It was shaped like a man but tall, so very tall. And it was fast. Before I could yell the shadow was on us, pouring over my mother. In the space of a heartbeat, she was simply gone.\n\n“No,” I whispered, clawing at the dissolving shadow where my mom used to be. “No, no, no, no, NO.”\n\nThe shadow was disappearing like a puddle sinking into the floor. There was a texture to it, oily and too slick to hold.\n\nI thought of my mother the night she found me lost in the woods, the night I’d run away. Her face filled my memory, her lighthouse smile. I remembered the relief I felt when she found me, the overwhelming love. I held onto that feeling, clutching it close.\n\n“You can’t have her,” I whispered.\n\nI closed my fist around the last threads of the shadow. There was a terrible sensation of *pulling*. It was like I’d caught a horse by the tail and it was trying to shake me. But I held on.\n\nA sense of ripping and being dragged. It was a riptide with a mind of its own. But I held on. It could not shake me.\n\nThe temperature was dropping every second and I felt my vision growing dark. The last thought that ran through my head before I blacked out was a promise to myself that even if I died, my grip would hold. I wouldn’t let my mother’s life slip away. All sounds and light faded, narrowing to a pinprick and then going black.\n\nI woke up under a field of stars. I was lying in soft grass, still wearing my pajama bottoms and an old t-shirt. It was cool, wherever I was, but comfortably so. I stood up. There were trees all around me, tall and close, stitched together with shadows. Immediately to my right, there was a road that ran straight as far as I could see, blurring into the horizon. But the stars, they were like nothing I’d ever seen before.\n\nBright ribbons of northern lights rippled above me in green and blue and purple. Stars lit the sky like millions of lanterns floating on a still ocean. The moon shone sharpest of all, a spotlight hanging above the treeline, so close I thought I could stretch up and brush its face.\n\n“***You are*** ***persistent***,” said a voice from the forest behind me.\n\nI whipped around but couldn’t see anyone. Then a dark spot began to clarify against the gloom. The silhouette separated itself and moved towards me. I recognized it instantly as the shadow from the dining room. As it moved closer, the thing grew and grew until it touched the sky and filled my vision. A deep dread sank into me but I stood my ground.\n\n“Give me back my mom,” I shouted.\n\nThe silhouette pulled away from the sky and then it was standing in front of me, the shape and size of a tall man. But instead of a shadow, the thing had wrapped itself in stars. Miniature constellations drifted across its body, floating slowly like a timelapse of a clear night sky. Burning brightest was the North Star, blue and warm. The space between the stars was absolute black, not a shadow but a complete absence of light. It was the most beautiful, terrifying thing I’d ever seen.\n\n“What are you?” I whispered.\n\n***“You know,”*** it replied.\n\n“Give her back,” I begged. “Please, give her back.”\n\n***“I can’t. It’s her time. Past her time. You delayed me. Delayed her.”***\n\nI clenched my fists. “She didn’t get enough time. *I* didn’t get enough time. It’s not right, it’s not fair.”\n\n***“Of course it’s not fair,”*** the starry thing said, ***“but it is right. You each have your time, and at the end of it, there’s me, and there is a road, and we walk it together.”***\n\n“Where to?” I asked. “Where are you taking her?”\n\n***“I don’t know. It’s not for me to know, only to know how to get there.”***\n\n“Then I won’t let you take her.” I planted myself in the road. The world was still and solemn around us. The constellations drifted like clouds and a soft breeze stirred the branches.\n\nThe starry thing didn’t respond for a moment.\n\n***“Your mother was kind and caring. Wherever she goes, she’ll have peace,”*** it promised.\n\n“But-”\n\nThe creature raised its hand. ***“Did you ever stop to think that death isn’t an enemy? Death simply*** **is.** ***It is the natural partner to life. It knows no prejudice or malice, has no designs or ambitions. Your mother spent so long suffering, felt so much pain. Instead of letting her rest, you took it upon yourself to draw her life beyond its given course. You kept her alive but at the cost of stretching her thin, prolonging her sickness, diluting her. Did you keep her alive for her benefit or for yours?”***\n\nI couldn’t answer.\n\n***“Stretching a life is unnatural, dangerous,”*** it told me. ***“In the weeks you kept me away you drew the attention of old things, hungry things, forces that would like nothing better than to swallow even the memory of your mother, to tear and bite until there was nothing left but pain and fear and a perfect emptiness.”***\n\nI shuddered remembering the clawing sounds, the shattered window, and the laughter from empty rooms.\n\n“I’m sorry,” I whispered. “Are they...can they hurt her here? Is she safe?”\n\nThe stars in the shadow burned brighter for a moment. ***“Your mother won’t walk her road alone. None of you do. I walk with you, always, to the end.”***\n\n“Can I see her?” I asked. “Please? Just, I...let me say goodbye.”\n\nIt considered for several seconds. ***“You are persistent.”***\n\nAnd then the starry thing was gone. I was standing alone on an empty road.\n\n“Brian?”\n\nI turned to find my mother behind me on the road. She looked younger, healthier than I’d seen her in years. The frailty was gone and my mother seemed exactly as I remembered her when she found me in the woods all those years ago.\n\n“Isn’t this the most beautiful dream?” she asked, staring up at the night sky.\n\n“Yeah,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. “A beautiful dream. I love you, mom. I love you so much, so very much.”\n\nShe smiled and touched my cheek. “I love you, too. Don’t cry, it’s okay. I’ll wake up any time now. I’ll see you then.”\n\nI nodded, wiping at tears. “Sure, yeah, I’ll see you then.”\n\n“What do you think is at the end of the road?” she asked. “Do you think I’ll have time to find out before I wake up?”\n\nI looked out at the road, scanning the trees for any hungry shadows. “I don’t know, I don’t know where it goes but...promise me you’ll be careful.”\n\nMy mom smiled wider. “Of course I’ll be careful.”\n\n“And she won’t walk alone,” said a familiar voice behind us both.\n\nI turned, expecting the starry thing. But the man standing on the road was entirely normal. The light from the moon was enough that I could see he had moss green eyes and a bright shock of red hair.\n\n“Such a beautiful dream,” my mother said.\n\nThe man came towards us and took my mother’s hand. He and I looked so alike, I could see why my mother confused us when she was sick.\n\n“Take care of her,” I told the man. “I…just please take care of her, make sure she gets where she’s going. There are, well, there are things out there that want her, to hurt her, it’s, it’s my fault, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry-”\n\nThe man squeezed my shoulder. “She’ll be safe, watched over. If the Devil himself is waiting on the road ahead *he’ll move.* Or he’ll be moved.”\n\nI believed him.\n\nThoughts raced through my head. There were so many things I wanted to say, questions, a million ways to say goodbye. I wanted to stretch out the moment for as long as I could but I realized I’d already delayed my mother enough.\n\n“I love you,” I told them both. “Goodbye.”\n\nI woke up back in my dining room sitting at the table, the unlit candle in front of me. The house was quiet and still. There was no more scratching, no sound or sense of life at all. I walked through every room. The house was empty. I was alone.\n\nI’ve spent the past couple months working on the house, erasing the marks I’d made, fixing up the property. Some nights I take long walks out into the forest. I’m far enough out in the country that on clear nights it’s like looking up at a sea of stars. I think about my parents the most during those walks, I grieve and remember in my own way. And I wonder where their road went, if they’re still traveling or if they reached their destination.\n\nI hope that their road takes them strange and beautiful places. When I walk at night, I look up for the North Star to keep from getting lost. Maybe they do the same.\n\nWhen it’s full, I also look up towards the moon. I wonder if my parents had a chance to visit, to search for hidden oceans. I like to think they did, that the moon has at least one Maria, the one I love most.\n\n[GTM](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Grand_Theft_Motto\/comments\/emzy3b\/the_stories\/)\n\n[Hello](https:\/\/travisbrownwriting.com)"},"220":{"title":"My dead girlfriend keeps messaging me on Facebook.

I just received another message, and it’s worse than any of the others. \n\nMy girlfriend died on the 7th of August, 2012. She was involved in a three car collision driving home from work when someone ran a red light. She passed away within minutes on the scene.\n\nWe had been dating for five years at that point. She wasn’t big on the idea of marriage (it felt archaic, she said, gave her a weird vibe), but if she had been, I would have married her within three months of our relationship. She was vibrant; the kind of girl that would choose dare every time. She was happiest when camping, but a total technophile too. She always smelled like cinnamon.\n\nThat being said, she wasn’t perfect. She always said something along the lines of, “If I kark it first, don’t just say good things about me. I’ve never liked that. If you don’t pay me out, you’re doing me a disservice. I’ve got so many flaws, and that’s just part of me.” So, this is for Em: the music she said she liked and the music she actually liked were very different. Her idea of affection was a side-hug. She had really long toes, like a chimpanzee. \n\nI know that’s tangential, but I don’t feel right discussing her without you having an idea of what she was like. \n\nOnto the meat. Em had been dead for approaching thirteen months when she first messaged me. \n\n---\n[**September 4, 2013.**](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/UMh0nZl.png) This is when it began. I had left Emily’s Facebook account activated so I could send her the occasional message, post on her wall, go through her albums. It felt too final (and too un-Emily) to memorialise it. I ‘share’ access with her mother (Susan) - meaning, her mother has her login and password and has spent a total of approximately three minutes on the website (or on a computer, total). After a little confusion, I assumed it was her.\n\n---\n[**November 16th, 2013.**](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/y0yzVaj.png) I had received confirmation from Susan that she hadn’t logged in to Em’s Facebook since the week of her death. Em knew a lot of people, so I instantly assumed this was one of her more tech savvy ‘friends’ fucking with me in the worst possible way. \n\nI noticed pretty much immediately that whoever was chatting with me was recycling old messages from [Em and my’s shared chat history.](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/fw80ZJG.png)\n\nThe ‘the wheels on the bus' comment was from when we were discussing songs to play on a road trip that never eventuated. ‘hello’ happened a million times.\n\n---\nAround **February 2014**, Emily started tagging herself in my photos. I would get notifications for them, but the tag would generally always be removed by the time I got to it. The first time I actually caught one, it felt like someone had punched me in the gut. ‘She’ would tag herself in spaces where it was plausible for her to be, or where she would usually hang out. I’ve got screenshots of two (from April and June; these are the only ones I’ve caught, so they’re a little out of the timeline I’m trying to write out):\n\nhttp:\/\/i.imgur.com\/X9G5agJ.png\n\nhttp:\/\/i.imgur.com\/55FwXKt.png\n\nAround this period of time, I stopped being able to sleep. I was too angry to sleep. \n\nShe would tag herself in random photos every couple of weeks. The friends who noticed and said something thought it was a fucked up bug; I found out recently that there have been friends who have noticed and didn’t say anything. Some of them have removed me from their Facebook friends list.\n\nAt this point, some of you may be wondering why I didn’t just kill my Facebook profile. I wish I had. I did for a little while. On days when I can’t get out there, though, it’s nice having my friends available to chat. It’s nice visiting Em’s page when the little green circle isn’t next to her name. I was already socially reclusive when Em was alive; her death turned me into something pretty close to a hermit, and Facebook and MMOs were (are) my only real social outlets.\n\n---\n[On **March 15th,**](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/KIL2Mx5.png) I sent what I assumed was Em's hacker a message.\n\n---\n[**On March 25th**, I received an ‘answer’.](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/j3HwZzv.png)\n\nIt wasn’t until I was going over these logs a few months later that I noticed she was recycling my own words as well.\n \nMy response seems kind of lacklustre here. I was intentionally providing him\/her with emotional ‘bait’ (‘This is actually devastating’) to keep them interested in their game; I was working off the assumption that the kind of person to do this would be the kind of person that would thrive on the distress of others. I was posting in tech forums, looking for ways to track this person, contacting Facebook. I needed to keep them around so I could gather ‘evidence’.\n\nBefore anyone asks, yes, I had changed the password and all security info countless times.\n\n---\n[**16th of April.** I receive this.](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/uvadlGa.png)\n\nThis seems like word salad. Like all our conversations so far, it’s recycled from previous messages she’s sent.\n\n---\n[**29th of April.**](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/FGmhuUQ.png)\n\nI hadn’t discovered any leads. Facebook had told me the locations her page had been accessed from, but since her death, they’re all places I can account for (my home, my work, her mum’s house, etc). My response here wasn’t bait. ‘yo ask Nathan’ was an in-joke too lame worth explaining, but seeing ‘her’ say it again just absolutely fucking crippled me. My reaction in real life was much less prettier. I’m not expecting my bond back.\n\nHer last few messages had started to scare me, but I wouldn’t admit it at this point.\n\n---\n[**8th of May.** I don’t really have the words for this.](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/GNL8TcO.png)\n\n‘FRE EZIN G’ is the first original word she’s (?) made. This has given me nightmares that have only started to kick in recently. I keep dreaming that she’s in an ice cold car, frozen blue and grey, and I’m standing outside in the warmth screaming at her to open the door. She doesn’t even realise I’m there. Sometimes her legs are outside with me.\n\n---\n[**24th of May.**](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/z295fHw.png)\n\nI wasn’t actually drunk. She wasn’t an affectionate girl, and it always embarrassed her to exchange ‘I love you’s, cuddle, talk about how much we meant to each other. She was more comfortable with it when I was boozed up. I got fake-drunk a lot.\n\nHer reply is what prompted me to finally memorialise her page, thinking it might help curb this behaviour. It might seem innocuous compared to her previous message - it’s pasted from an old conversation where I was trying to convince her to let me drive her home from a friend’s. \n\nIn the collision, the dashboard had crushed her. She was severed in a diagonal line from her right hip to midway down her left thigh. One of her legs was found tucked under the backseat. \n\n---\n[**Going back in time. 7th of August, 2012.**](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ujUNJQm.png)\n\nThese are logs from the day she died. She was usually home from work by 4.30. This, alongside a couple of voicemail messages, is the last time I talked to her under the assumption that she was alive. You’ll see why I’m showing you these soon.\n\n---\n[**Yesterday. 1st of July, 2014.**](http:\/\/imgur.com\/W6qzAZI)\n\nI memorialised her page a couple of days after I received the message about walking. Until today, she’d been quiet; she wasn’t even tagging herself in my photos. \n\nI don’t know what to do anymore. Do I kill her memorial page? What if it is her? I want to puke. I don’t know what’s happening. \n\nI just heard a Facebook alert. I'm too afraid to swap windows and check it.\n"},"221":{"title":"Something went wrong with my heart transplant","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/8wu3y1\/something_went_wrong_with_my_heart_transplant\/","flair":null,"author":"KatrinCiernan","selftext":"I’ve always had a weak heart.\n\nNot just physically, I’ve always been afraid of my own shadow. It was unsurprising when the doctors told me my heart murmur wasn’t just a heart murmur. A year of tests. A year of therapy, constant trips to the hospital and I was finally told that it had all been for nothing.\n\nMy poor weak heart wouldn’t last till Christmas. It’s a strange thing being told that you’re dying; I didn’t come to terms with it at first. I drank and I spent my money. I did reckless, stupid things because I was so damn scared.\n\nThen I got the news. That a young woman called Laura had been declared brain dead and that I, the lucky chosen one, would be getting a brand new heart a week later. I drove to the hospital slowly, carefully, and readied myself for the ordeal that was to come.\n\nAs I was laying in bed on the last night, the thought of Laura swirled around in my head and it wouldn’t leave me alone. It was like her name was in flashing lights every time I closed my eyes.\n\nIt was wrong, I know it was, but I had to see the woman who was giving me her heart. It didn’t feel right not to put a face to the one who was saving my life. I knew her name, I knew what ward she was staying on- I had overheard the two nurses discussing it. I wandered down the meandering hallways until I found what I was looking for, taking my time, making sure I didn’t miss any name. I guess I had time on my hands now.\n\nIn the second to last room, she lay in bed. A woman sat on the bed next to her, holding her hand, and my own weak heart stuttered.\n\n“Excuse me.” I had no idea what to say to her. “I’m Jenna. I’m the person… I’m having surgery tomorrow and..” What I assumed was Laura’s mother stood up and I could tell from the look in her eye that she knew who I was.\n\n“Thank you for visiting. I know it’s strange, but a part of her is going to be living on in you. I wanted to meet you.” I stood there, helpless and lost for words. Laura’s mother beckoned me over.\n\n“Please.” She said. “Don’t feel uncomfortable. Its what she would have wanted.” I sat on the chair next to Laura.\n\n“How did she-“ I broke off. It was too awful to ask. Laura’s mother gave me a thin smile.\n\n“She was a care worker. Looked after battered wives, abused women. Last month she met a guy and… Well. I suppose years of training can’t help you when you’re in love. She ignored the warning signs. And he killed her. She dedicated her life to those who needed her.” Laura’s mother looked down. I don’t know why I did it, but I reached over, and held Laura’s hand. I squeezed it.\n\n“I’m so sorry. I had a boyfriend once who… He was like that too. Someone like Laura convinced me to leave.” Laura’s mother gave me another half smile. I could see the tears in her eyes.\n\nThen Laura squeezed my hand. Tightly. She gripped me so hard that her fingernails dug into my skin. I recoiled, a look of horror on my face. Laura’s mother looked at me calmly.\n\n“She squeezes my hand sometimes as well. I think the Doctors called it muscle spasms. Either way. There’s none of Laura left in there anymore.” I looked at the small crescent moons that had just started to bleed on the palm of my hand.\n\nThe surgery went perfectly. I was wheeled to the recovery suite after it was over and done with, the raised wound on my chest covered by gauze. It was better if I didn’t see it, I thought. I didn’t need any more heart issues. I spent the first day doped up on the pain medication, eating only a little and sitting up maybe two times. It was a long process, they reassured me.\n\nLaura’s mother came to visit me the day before I was due to leave. Her calm demeanor hadn’t wavered but I could see that she was suffering. She looked ten years older, and her hands shook when she gave me a hug.\n\n“When are you going home?”\n\n“Tomorrow.” I told her. “Please, come visit whenever you want.” I started to jot down my address for her, when out of the corner of my eye, a flash of blonde disappeared through the doorway. The same brilliant blonde as Laura’s hair.\n\n“Ow!” I cried out suddenly. It felt like someone had sharply squeezed my hand so hard it had almost crushed the bones. Laura’s mother rushed to my side, a look of concern in her eyes.\n\n“What’s wrong? Is it your heart?” She stumbled over the last words, coming to terms with what she had said. I tried to reassure her and said I’d let the doctors know, and she left with a look of worry on her face.\n\nWhen I looked down, a new set of crescent fingernail marks were below the ones that Laura’s had made. Ten identical bleeding smiles.\n\nThe taxi ride home was short, and before I knew it I was back in my own flat. It felt strange to try and slot back into where I had left off, my life had been almost over the last time I had been here. I looked over the mess and the cardboard boxes, the remnants of one night where I had tearfully tried to pack and store my belongings so my parents wouldn’t have to do it when I died.\n\nLaura’s heart beat so strongly it felt like it would come out of my chest. It did this all the time, and I realized this was what a healthy heart must feel like. So why couldn’t I shake my feeling of unease?\n\nThat night, I had a dream.\n\nLaura was in her hospital bed, but her mother was gone. I could hear my heart, Laura’s heart, beating in my eardrums so loudly it was painful. I tried to cover them, but my hands were pinned to my sides. Some unexplainable force was moving me towards the motionless figure of Laura on the bed, her lips were blue and the window had come open, whipping her blonde hair around her face.\n\nI was almost on top of her when her eyes flew open.\n\nThey were milky white, the eyes of someone dead.\n\n“Get out.” She rasped, her voice guttural. I could hear the heartbeat faster and faster, drumming until I thought I couldn’t take it anymore.\n\nThen I woke up. The sound had been real. Laura’s heart was so loud it felt like it would rupture my eardrums and I screamed in agony, trying to cover my ears. It was useless, it was coming from some deep place inside me, I could feel it reverberating around the hollows of my chest.\n\nI stumbled out of bed, gasping for air, and tried to find my phone. I needed to call someone, anyone, an ambulance or my mom. Anyone that would pick up.\n\n“Get out.” It was a faint whisper over the hammering thumps of Laura’s heart, a low guttural voice that sounded like it had been made by an animal, and I crawled to the door, down the hallway, choking on my screams for help. My neighbor opened the door, his eyes as wide as saucers at the sight of me on the floor clutching my chest.\n\nHe drove me to hospital as I cried in the passenger seat of his car.\n\nAfter about fifty different checkups, the doctors told me that absolutely nothing was wrong with me. They told me my heart was regular, my blood pressure was normal, and that everything was going just swimmingly. I stood in the waiting area, wallowing in my shame and frustration.\n\nThat heart didn’t belong to me.\n\nMy phone buzzed on the counter, an unknown number. Great. That was all I needed, more unexplained, scary things like a stranger on the end of the phone. My voice sounded small on the line,\n\n“Hello?”\n\n“Good morning, this is the Thames Valley police, we’ve called to report an incident that occurred in your flat at around 1.30am today.” I felt a wave of embarrassment.\n\n“I’m so sorry, I recently had surgery and I wasn’t feeling well. I had to have my neighbor drive me to the hospital and I think I panicked a little in the hallway before I left.” There was a small silence on the other end of the phone.\n\n“I’m afraid this is something you might want to be sitting down for.” I felt Laura’s heart beats, strong and calm. “There was an incident of forced entry by Mr Samuel Matthews, according to our police records he’s your ex partner and you filed a restraining order against him in September 2017.” My blood ran cold.\n\n“I did.”\n\n“He’s in police custody. We found an automatic weapon on him and we believe he had the intent to harm you. We have an officer currently stationed at your flat who can fill you in depending on how long your hospital stay will be.”\n\nI thanked him and hung up the phone.\n\nFor a moment, I leant against the wall, the horror slowly spreading over me. If I had been in my flat ten minutes later he would have found me.\n\nLaura’s heartbeats filled my ears again but now they were gentle, calming. Her mother said she dedicated every part of her to helping those who needed it.\n\nI put both my hands on my chest, overwhelmed by my own gratitude, and listened to Laura."},"222":{"title":"I knew a woman who never took off her wedding dress","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/f4fhyv\/i_knew_a_woman_who_never_took_off_her_wedding\/","flair":null,"author":"poloniumpoisoning","selftext":"Pauline was a sweet woman who lived across the street. We weren’t close as kids or teenagers because she was around five years older than me, but our parents were friends. I think she babysat me when I was younger too.\n\nWhen my mother learned that Pauline was engaged, she sent me to help on the bridal shower. Poor mom, she thought I was like that because I was too often around boys and needed to learn to be more feminine, but she’s got that backwards.\n\nThat’s when I first learned that Pauline and her soon-to-be husband had made a blood oath.\n\n“The first to die comes and takes the other as soon as they can”, she explained to me, swirling the ruby ring gently around her fingers.\n\n“Isn’t that too dramatic? What if you end up divorcing and marrying other people?”\n\n“We won’t. We are soulmates!” she assured me. Her naïveté made her incredibly beautiful, but it felt really wrong being 21 and thinking that I was so much more mature than a 26 years-old.\n\nI didn’t pursue the matter, but she kept talking about him in a dreamy tone. *Aiden would like this*, *I wish Aiden was here*, and so on. Her dreamy tone almost made me believe that soulmates existed and that you could make the person you love the most follow you in death by just willing it.\n\nI met Pauline’s friends, and we all ended up having some quality girl time. Pauline explained to us all how she believed that you can wake up in the afterlife and start controlling things with your mind.\n\n“Of course your memories will be hazy”, she clarified. “But that’s why we made the blood oath. So we can remember.”\n\n“And how will one get the other back?” I asked, entertaining her.\n\n“I like to believe that we’ll both grow wings!”\n\nIt was all terribly silly when I think back, but Pauline had something about her that made everyone pay attention and marvel at her words.\n\nDespite the age gap, we ended up becoming good friends; I think we were finally at an age where it didn’t matter anymore. Since I was in college but lived with my parents and didn’t need to work, I had a lot of spare time to accompany her to wedding dress fittings, cake tasting and all the little things that were the world for brides.\n\nBut Pauline was a pleasant bride-to-be and never freaked out; she was just thrilled about marrying the man of her dreams, and wanted to make it pretty if possible.\n\nLittle by little, I grew to understand her devotion to Aiden. And he was just as crazy about her, if not more. When they were together the world felt like a brighter and warmer place. Like marshmallows slowly melting over my heart.\n\nThe day of the wedding came, around half a year after her bridal shower.\n\nIt was neither a big nor a small wedding – it felt like both Pauline and Aiden were able to invite exactly everyone they wanted around on their happiest day. Not one more, not one less. I felt somewhat honored to be there.\n\nStill, the happiest day never came.\n\nWhen Pauline arrived, belated as any bride should, there was whispering and disquiet; Aiden wasn’t there yet. \n\nHer smile didn’t falter, because she was completely sure that he would never bail on her. But I could tell she was worried. The bridesmaids – her two closest friends since high school – started making calls to try to find out if the groom had a sudden illness.\n\nSoon they realized that Aiden’s parents were there, but not his brother. They informed that their other son was supposed to drive the groom as part of his best man’s duties.\n\nWhen the devastating news came, everyone wanted to comfort her, everyone wanted desperately to protect her precious heart, but it was too torn apart to notice anyone else.\n\n*It was all too fast and scary. (…) A sports car ran a red light straight into the Mirage. (…) The man in the passenger seat was dead on arrival. (…) The driver was taken to the hospital but his state was critical.*\n\nIt was all so hard on everyone. Aiden’s brother ended up surviving, but he’ll be tetraplegic for life due to severe injury on his spinal cord. As far as I know, he’s also miserable because he wished he could be the one who died.\n\nRight after the wedding that never happened, Pauline and Aiden’s parents dealt with selling the house they had just bought, and Pauline continued living with her parents. They both still worked office jobs, so her other friends and I started taking turns keeping her company while they weren’t home.\n\nI did my best to be there for my neighbor and friend, but *she* wasn’t there. She was living in delusion, and the only thing you could see leaking into reality was her desolation. \n\nI never saw such a deep and heart-wrenching sadness. Pauline refused to take off her dress. She would spend the whole day by the window waiting for Aiden and the whole night crying because she missed him desperately. Every single day.\n\nShe was hopeful it was a matter of time until he woke up on the other side and remembered to bring her along. That’s why she wouldn’t take off the dress – he had died on his wedding suit, so it was only natural that she was up to par.\n\nHer parents and every single one of her friends tried to coax her into changing her clothes. We promised she could always keep the dress close for when Aiden came, but she knew that we didn’t really believe he would. It was like promising your kid that you’d buy them a Happy Meal some other day. \n\nNo one dared to penetrate her grief and force her out of the dress. She spent the day in it, slept in it, even bathed in it; since we live in a warm and arid weather, having it dry wasn’t an issue, only everything else.\n\nThe once beautiful organza and silk were now ragged, grimy and smelling. But she still refused to take it off. She started to believe that Aiden wouldn’t be able to spot her in the crowd if she wasn’t wearing it.\n\nIt was impossible to change her mind, and even though she was seeing a therapist three times a week, she wasn’t improving. Her mourning and PTSD were turning into a darker, more permanent mental illness.\n\nShe started talking to Aiden, then explained to us that he was nearby, so she could feel him coming. He was just taking a while because flying is really hard when your wings are newly-acquired.\n\nThen one morning, she disappeared for good. No one saw her leaving, and no one saw her at all after that.\n\nThe only thing that we were able to find, in the small grove behind the house, was her filthy wedding dress. It had two large holes poked on her back, like it had grown wings.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAfter finding the dress, everyone who loved Pauline was relieved; her mother readily admitted that she actually believed that Aiden somehow had come back to take her. Others weren’t so fond of the supernatural explanation, but thinking that there was a chance that it happened brought us a sense of closure.\n\nIt’s not that we were happy about her death, but we conformed to the possibility of her finally finding her peace.\n\nShe was an angel, after all. Why wouldn’t she grow wings and escape her flesh prison?\n\nThe family held a beautiful memorial service in her honor, and slowly we all started moving on with our lives.\n\nNow, you might ask what I believe in. I would laugh bitterly because I don’t have this choice to begin with.\n\nBeing the person who spent the most time watching Pauline those days, it was only natural that I was the one to found her dead in the bathtub. Hiding and subsequently getting rid of her body was the hardest thing I have ever done; tampering with the dress, though, was eerily healing.\n\nStill, I think that she would be pleased to know that I faked her rapture. \n\nA romantic and mystifying death fitted her way more than suicide[.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PPoisoningTales\/)"},"223":{"title":"My girlfriend talks in her sleep. She's been saying the most horrible things recently...","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/8w4gaz\/my_girlfriend_talks_in_her_sleep_shes_been_saying\/","flair":null,"author":"RyanMatthews_","selftext":"I’m infatuated with her. \n\nUtterly infatuated.  \n\nAnd it wasn’t at a healthy level.  Far from it.  I would think about her every moment she was away.  I would sometimes sit on my couch and just stare at my phone waiting for her to text.  I’d tell myself “Don’t contact her.  *Don't*.   It will come off as too strong.”  But then I’d still find myself clicking her name on my contact list before my inner voice would continue, “You don’t want her to know how desperately smitten you are with her.  It’s unattractive.  It will scare her off.  No, you must wait for her to call you this time.”\n\nBut it was excruciating and exhausting.  Almost unbearable.  I once heard that the ancient Greeks believed that falling madly and irrationally in love with somebody was a curse that you would wish upon your enemies.  I could never understand what they meant.  After all, isn’t falling head over heels in love the ultimate goal nowadays?  But now that it’s happened to me, I have to say… the ancient Greeks were right.  This is a curse.  I was barely in control of myself.  Almost as though my infatuation with her had… possessed me.\n\nThe two of us were sexually active together but still in the “dating” phase.  We were at that make or break era of a blossoming relationship where we’d either have “the talk” and formally be in a relationship or we’d start to slowly drift apart.  The latter of which I don’t think I’d be able to cope with.  Honestly, I wouldn’t be able to.  Almost everything about her captivated me.  The way she held her hand over her mouth when she laughed.  How she’d caress the pendant of her necklace when she was frightened.  How she’d twirl her hair in her finger when she was excited.   All of it.  Her smell.  Her smile.  Her eyes.  \n\nYeah, I know.  It probably makes you sick reading about it.  I feel the same way.  I was never the hopeless romantic type.  But now I can’t stop fantasizing about her.  I’d think about us doing the long three-hour hike up to that magnificent view from one of our first dates.  To that first kiss, as we overlooked the lights of the city.  But this time I’d get down on one knee, bring out the ring, and… well… you know what would happen next.  \n\nAlright, fine.  I’ll stop.  Yes, this is a girl I’d only been casually dating for a couple of months.  I shouldn’t be thinking about proposing yet.  I know that.  I'm just barely able to control myself any longer.  I feel as though I’m losing power over the decisions I make. \n\nAnd that brings me to why I’m here writing this out at the moment.  It started with the first real thing that troubled me about her. We’d never actually spent a night together.  No matter how late she was over, once either of us showed signs of being tired, she’d up and leave.  She wouldn’t leave awkwardly or in anger. Just a casual kiss good night, a smile, and a “call me soon”. \n\nIt was something I didn’t really even notice the first few times she did it.  But after almost 8 weeks of dating, it was becoming strange.  I’d have to ask her about it.\n\nIt took drinking almost an entire bottle of wine before I had the courage to do it.  She looked almost defeated when I asked and lowered her eyes in embarrassment.  “I knew this talk would come eventually,” She started.  She took in a deep breath with a long drawn out exhale.  “Recently….“  she paused again.  “I’ve started talking in my sleep.”  She shook her head in embarrassment.    “It’s called somniloquy, I looked it up.”  \n\nI shrugged and laughed out loud.  My demeanor seemed to say “That’s it?”\n\n“No, Stephen… listen” she said.  She wasn’t laughing.  “It’s bad.  It… It’s completely out of control.  It’s not just random words or gibberish.  No.  It’s horrible.  I say horrible disgusting things.”  She was starting to raise her voice, breath heavy,  and tear up.\n\nI approached her and held her.  I told her it couldn’t be that bad.  I told her to spend the night.  I told her she was probably exaggerating.  \n\nI was wrong.\n\nThat night she stayed at my house.  But she warned me of something before falling asleep.  “Whatever you do, don’t wake me up.  It makes me really scared and disoriented if that happens.  And don’t respond to me.  Just ignore it.”  I nodded and agreed.   “If it becomes too much,” she continued, “just leave the room and sleep on the couch.  I won’t mind.”\n\nI told her not to worry about it. I told her that it wouldn’t be a big deal.  I told her I wouldn’t leave to the couch.  I’d stay beside her in the bed.\n\nBut I was wrong.\n\nI couldn’t even last one night.\n\n***\n\nWe both fell asleep without incident.  I don’t know how many hours passed, but I woke up in the dark with the sensation that someone was watching me.  And then I remembered… *She* was with me.  She was actually spending the night.  I smiled.\n\nBut then I noticed the shadowy outline of her sitting up on the bed.  She was looking down at me.  Staring.  \n\nIt creeped me out.  I’ll admit it.  Her posture was entirely different.  It was as though it wasn’t even her at all.\n\nThen she spoke.\n\nIt wasn’t her voice that I heard.  It was much lower and gravelly.  Like something out of a horror movie.\n\n“*I’ll chew the skin from your bones.*”  She said.\n\nI froze. \n\nAt first, I just kept looking at her.  This was not at all what I expected.  I thought it would be more like the way Tourette’s is often portrayed.  Just random swearing and shouting.   I honestly thought to myself… what will I do if she attacks me right now?  What if she really does try to chew the skin from my bones?  \n\nBut then she just lied down and went back to sleep.\n\nI was creeped out.  I tried to lie back down and ignore her but struggled.  I couldn’t even close my eyes without thinking “Maybe she’s sitting up again and staring at me.”  And then one time I rolled over to look at her…and she *was*.\n\nHer face was pressed right towards mine.  Her breath was foul and rotted.  Something that was most certainly not normal for her.  She spoke again, in the same voice as before.\n\n“*If you don’t move to the couch, you’ll be dead by morning.*”\n\nThat did it for me.  I sat up in a moment and headed for the living room.\n\nShe made some sort of wheezing sound as I left.  I think it was supposed to be laughter.\n\nI was lying on the couch, but I wasn’t going to be able to fall back to sleep.  I was far too shaken.\n\nI was staring out towards the window, hoping to see the first few hints of the sun rising.\n\nAnd then I thought I heard something.  From the bedroom.\n\nI listened.\n\nAnd then I heard it again. \n\n“*Stephen.*”   It was that same low and gravelly voice. It sounded like a witch. \n\nI tried to just ignore it at first.  But then it continued. \n\n“*Stephen.*”  \n\nStill I said nothing.  \n\n“*I know you can hear me, Stephen.  You’re awake now.  Why don’t you come back into the bedroom?*”\n\nThe voice barely sounded human.  \n\n“*Or maybe you’d prefer if I come to **you**?*”\n\nI still didn’t say anything.  I was told not to.  But I listened.  If I heard her start walking towards the bedroom door, I’m not even joking, I would have run right out of the apartment. But she had asked me not to respond to her sleep talking.  So I didn’t.\n\nAnd then I heard her once more.\n\n“*Sorry if this spoils your plans.*”   She began laughing.  “*The two of you were supposed to walk that trail again.*” she started.  I wasn’t even remotely prepared for what she’d say next.\n\n “*You’d both be so tired when you’d reach the top.  You’d look over the city.  Then you’ll get on one knee, and bring out the ring.*”  She began laughing. \n\nAnd that’s when I realized this wasn’t just a problem with sleep talking.  It was something much more.  Something supernatural.  I had never told anybody about my proposal fantasy.  There was simply no way she could have known about any of it.\n\nThis was no longer about merely talking in ones’ sleep.  This was about possession. I can’t go back into the bedroom.  I have no idea what would happen if I did.  Instead, I’m going to wait it out, holding up in my living room until the sun rises.  I have a couple more hours yet.  I can hear her laughing occasionally in the bedroom. It’s still not her voice. Still that same low pitch cackle.\n\nBut as I sit on my couch writing this out, here’s what scares me the most…\n\nMaybe my infatuation and utter obsession with her wasn’t normal.  I said before that I felt like I was losing control of myself.  More so I believe than the typical falling in love story.  No.  I fear that the infatuation I felt was the entity slowly taking control of *me*.  Of it controlling my thoughts, fears, ambitions, and anxieties.  Maybe once I become completely absorbed, a transfer would occur, and she would be free of it. \n\nI know I should leave.  That I should open the front door, get in my car, and drive away from here.  But I can’t. I can’t leave her.  I’ve already lost control.\n\nI’m infatuated with her.\n\nUtterly infatuated."},"224":{"title":"***EMERGENCY ALERT***","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/5wduaf\/emergency_alert\/","flair":"Series","author":"TheCrystalGem","selftext":"***EMERGENCY ALERT***\n-THIS IS NOT A TEST\n-IMMEDIATE THREAT FOR RESIDENTS OF [withheld] COUNTIES\n-BE WARY OF:\n  -SEVERE WINDS\n  -LIGHTNING\n  -SEVERE RAIN\n  -FLASH FLOODS\n-RESIDENTS ARE ADVISED TO STAY INDOORS\n  -PLEASE LOCK OR BAR ALL ENTRYWAYS INTO YOUR HOUSE\n-RESTRAIN FROM USING ANY DEVICES THAT EMIT LIGHT OR LOUD NOISE\n-PLEASE ENTER A ROOM WITH NO WINDOWS\n-EFFECTIVE INDEFINITELY\n-ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE\n\nThis was the message I was greeted by in the middle of an episode of Big Bang Theory in my living room. Frozen halfway through a forkful of Kraft Mac N' Cheese, I sat bolt upright and turned around to look out the window. The sky, as I thought, was crystal clear. A few clouds, but nothing crazy. No rain. No thunder. Nothing. Confused, I turned off the TV, erasing the alert from the screen. My two dogs came walking over to me and I patted them on their heads. One of my dogs, the other's brother, was shaking profusely from the buzzing noise that always shows up with Amber Alerts and the like. I left them in the living room and walked through my kitchen and onto my front porch. My neighbors, too, were standing outside their houses, all looking at the sky in bemusement.\n\nAn immediate threat? It didn't seem like it, I thought as my phone started buzzing with the same tone. One by one, everyone else's phones started ringing.\n\nI should explain, I guess, that I have never experienced a severe weather warning for real. Not once in my life. I suppose it should come as no surprise, seeing as I live in Oregon of all places. I supposed maybe it was just a mistake, but just as the thought floated across my mind, I heard the  siren.\n\nThe siren of the squad car coming down the street. An officer talked through the speaker. \"This is not a drill. Please enter your homes immediately. Do not go outside under any circumstances.\"\n\nNever the kind of guy to ignore higher authorities, I entered my house nervously, turned off all the lights on the above-ground floors, and took my dogs into my basement with a sleeping bag, some food, my phone, a charger, some spare batteries, flashlight, and other essentials. I called my brother, who lives a couple of blocks away, and asked him if he had gotten the message. He had. I considered saying we should stay together to wait out the storm, but then I figured we'd probably get in trouble for that. So I hung up, got comfortable on my sleeping bag, and started browsing Reddit. Eventually, I fell asleep, seeing as I was under stress and had woken up pretty early. When I woke up, I realized that I still didn't hear any rain. Seriously, nothing at all. More confused than ever, I decided to see if the alert had been called off. I turned on my phone and called my brother again. It went straight to voicemail, though, so I gave up. I decided to risk it and go upstairs. I had to squeeze between the door and the wall to keep my dogs from following me upstairs, but I won and they stayed in the basement. I walked through my kitchen to the front door and looked out the window part of it. As I squinted to see outside in the dark (strange, seeing as it was only 2:00 PM judging by my clock), the TV flickered briefly. I looked around at it and it flickered again, but this time every device on the ground floor flickered. Thinking little of it, I turned around and looked through the door again. Every house on the block had its lights turned off. Nobody was outside.\n\nExcept for one teenage girl.\n\nA thin, short-haired girl wearing what looked like a pillowcase walked unsteadily down the street, very slowly, looking as though she was having some difficulty. I turned around, now extremely confused and worried, and got the dogs' food bowls, which I had forgotten earlier. When I looked up, one of the houses, the one diagonally across from mine (right next to the house across the street and to the left) had it's lights on and one of its windows broken. I shuddered and rushed back into the basement as the lights flickered intensely.\n\nI locked the door to the basement and sat on an old, tattered couch that I had brought down here--the basement is where I put everything I didn't have room for. So, yeah, it's packed. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention something that may be worth noting: I live in a small town. A very small town, probably with a population of under 500. Or less. As a matter of fact, it isn't even on most maps. We never make any news, we never have any scandals or anything. This is the first interesting thing that's happened, I think, since Mrs. [withheld] lost her dentures to a raccoon. So, it's possible this whole thing seems way worse than it is.\n\nCall me crazy, but until a few minutes ago, I was thoroughly enjoying myself. I love these scenarios, and my basement is totally secure, so I'm having the time of my life. Well, I was. I decided to turn on my radio--what harm could it do, as long as I didn't turn the volume up to high?\n\nI was surprised to find that our local radio station was still up and running. They were talking about the weather, so I listened hard for any news that I hadn't heard. There wasn't any--they were just as confused as us. Not wanting to listen to crappy pop music indefinitely, I tuned into another station. This one was one I hadn't heard before.\n\n-\"Could you give me the status of [withheld] county? Over.\"\n-\"No new developments. Over.\"\n-\"Okay. Any fatalities? Over.\"\n-\"What part of \"no new developments\" do you not understand, McClellan? A squad car will be passing through soon to scan the area for the target. Over.\"\n-\"Any ETA on that? Over.\"\n-\"No, not yet. Over.\"\n-\"And any word from HQ, Jones? Over.\"\n-\"No, McClellan. Not yet. Not since 013 first got out. Over.\"\n-\"Well, let me know if and when they contact you. Over.\"\n\nAt that point, I lost the signal. Well, not really, but the connection got so weak that I could barely make out anything they were saying. I figured I must have found a police communication channel. And I had been left with no answers whatsoever.\n\nThat was about forty-five minutes ago, as of me writing this now. Guys, I don't know what's going on. Do any of you live near me? You'll know if you've received the warning. I'd say what county I live in, and which ones were affected, but I don't know to for privacy reasons. Anyway, I'll keep you guys updated, okay? Until then, wish me luck.\n\nEDIT: Woah, guys, this has blown up. I'll be sure to keep you posted over the next few days!\n\nUPDATE: Just a quick update before the first major update--about five minutes ago, a car alarm went off somewhere to the right of my house. I'm too freaked out to go check it out, but I'll go up and see how it looks tomorrow morning, and I'll update you then.\n\nNEXT UPDATE COMING TODAY"},"225":{"title":"I work security at Disney World... well, I mean I did.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/8oueb7\/i_work_security_at_disney_world_well_i_mean_i_did\/","flair":null,"author":"disneysecurity","selftext":"I work in security at Disney World, the happiest place on Earth. Typically, I wouldn’t say where I work as obviously there are some pretty strict rules about things employees can put online, but I just don’t think I can tell this properly without that context. And, honestly, I think this may be it for me anyway with this job. I just can’t see myself working here any longer now. \n\nI’ve been with the company for 23 years. The first 20 years I worked in the parks – nabbing shoplifters and rounding up people who were drinking too much for the heat. Occasionally there’d be a fight to break up, but people usually kept it pretty mild. \n\nThe heat and walking was getting too much for me the last few years so I asked to be transferred somewhere with a\/c and the company moved me to one of their resorts. While the working conditions were 110&#37; better as far as climate and comfort go, the guest issues were trickier \\- mainly domestics. I guess the expensive and stress of vacation got to a lot of people and I’d be called by neighboring rooms because some mom and dad were yelling at each other. I’d try to suggest they take a nap or go do separate activities for a bit and that would usually calm them down.\n\nBut none of that is what I’m here for. I’ve got to get this out while I have time.\n\nThree days ago I got a call from management. Apparently a couple of days before that, housekeeping had went into a room that should’ve been turned over that day (turned over is when one guest leaves by about 11:00 a.m. and the next guest checks in around 3:00 p.m.) and all of the guests’ items were still in the room. Housekeeping made a note of it and moved on, but during the next two days when they entered the room, everything was still there and untouched.\n\nI went to check it out and sure enough there was an empty room full of luggage, clothes, snacks, some toys, everything a family would need for vacation. The manager had already looked up the previous reservation and it was for a family – dad, mom, two little kids. I tried to call the phone numbers they had given but all I got was voice mail. We were a bit stumped so I made the call that housekeeper could clean the room and take the family’s personal items to be held until we got in contact with someone.\n\nI went digging into the reservation more. The family had arrived five days before housekeeping discovered all of their stuff.  I found that the family had paid a parking fee and their vehicle description was listed. A quick walk of the parking lots and I had easily located their vehicle. So that ruled out a car accident or them deciding to just leave all their stuff behind. \n\nNext, I saw that they had bought a dining plan. This is when a guest prepays for all of their food. They’re given a certain number of “credits” to use for meals. This family had only used 3 credits and the last one was two days after they checked in. It appeared that the day they arrived, they got here late and probably just stayed on the resort. The next day they used 2 credits at Epcot. The second park day they used just 1 credit at Magic Kingdom and it was at breakfast time. \n\nNow at Disney we have something called Magic Bands. Magic Bands are worn by the guests and act as a room key, park ticket, credit card, dining reservation payment, fastpass (a system used to bypass lines), and more. It took some work, but I was finally able to look up this family’s fastpass history. The day they went to Magic Kingdom, they had breakfast at a restaurant in the park, rode a couple of rides, and then rode their last ride, It’s a Small World around 11:00 a.m. Then nothing.\n\nFinally, it was time to bring in someone else on this. I called an old co\\-worker at Magic Kingdom and asked him to pull security footage for It’s a Small World at the time they rode it and I made my way over there. When I got there, my friend was very confused, almost distraught, looking. He showed me what he found. There’s usually a camera in the direction of where rides load and unload. The footage showed them scanning their bands to use fastpasses for the ride and boarding the ride. The footage from the exit of the ride just showed the other people in their car exiting. They weren’t there.\n\nOf course we thought the worse, maybe one of the kids had fallen out and mom and dad and the other kid got off in the middle of the ride to help and they all got injured or killed or stuck in machinery somewhere. So we shut down the ride. Middle of the damn day. Turned off that ear worm music and turned up the lights. Me and my buddy walked that ride three times before we called in help. Eventually there was close to ten cast members searching, and we didn’t find shit except for three cell phones and a hat.\n\nI was right stumped. I've kept digging the past couple of days, and I’m not sure who to tell what I found next to. I’ve called the police and I suppose they’re on the way, but the company has a way of covering up things like this and I decided I can’t live with myself if I don’t put out some type of warning.\n\nI kept digging into their reservation over the last couple of days and today I noticed they had purchased memory maker. There are photographers all over the parks and cameras in a lot of the rides and, with memory maker, the photos are all free. They automatically get added to a guest’s Disney account when the system knows their picture has been taken. And the system always knows. Everyone’s whereabouts are always known with the Magic Bands.\n\nWell, I opened up their memory maker photo album and, I swear, there’s 732 pictures. The first 30 or so are pretty normal. Epcot, a few rides, in front of the castle. But the rest. The rest are all in It’s a Small World. The rides only take one picture per go around. So it appears as though this family has ridden this ride over 700 times. The first picture was pretty normal. Everyone looked happy, it was busy day and a full car of guests.  The next one is rough to look at. The car is empty except for this little family and they look so darn confused. The next 10\\-15 I can see dad getting angry, yelling. Mom is holding onto those two kids like her life depends on it and you can see the kids getting increasingly upset, crying. And it goes on, and on, and on. After 50 or so it looks like they’re trying to get out. In one the dad is missing. In another they’re all gone.  Maybe like they’ve bailed early in the ride and tried to walk out, but in the very next one, they’re all right back in that damn car. After around 450 or so, I only see the mom and kids. It’s just when I look closely I can see dad, maybe just his body now, slumped down in one of the other seats. Since about 675, there’s just mom and one kid. Another body in another seat.  The mom and kid aren’t moving anymore. I think them two are still alive, just damn near catatonic. Looking straight ahead, pale.  \n\nAnd, y’all, I swear on my fucking life, the dolls are moving or something. In some of these pictures I can tell they aren’t where they should be. I even saw one with a doll in the car with this family.\n\nI can’t look anymore or I’m going to lose my lunch. I closed the album. It’s file sized has increased since I closed it. God, are there new pictures being added? \n\nI see on security cameras that the local PD just arrived so they’ll take over soon. I wish I knew what the fuck is going on, but I also wish this damn thing had never landed in my lap. I don’t think I’ll be able to update this. After I talk to the police, I think I’m going to walk out of here and never come back. I just wanted to get this out there, before Disney feeds the media some bullshit cover up as to why a whole family vanished. They didn’t vanish. I know where they are."},"226":{"title":"My husband insists on keeping this one painting of a woman","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/twijls\/my_husband_insists_on_keeping_this_one_painting\/","flair":null,"author":"RobertMort","selftext":"When my husband and I first got married and moved in together, we had a few fights. On personal space, on chores… and on décor.\n\nNamely, my husband insisted on keeping this weird painting of a woman.\n\n“Who is she?” I’d asked when I first saw it, leaned against a mountain of moving boxes.\n\n“Dunno. Got it at a rummage sale.”\n\nIt was an original painting. Oil, I think, judging by the way the light reflected off the brushstrokes. It depicted a young woman standing in a dark room, looking over her shoulder at the viewer. She was actually rather beautiful. Blonde hair falling over her shoulders like a waterfall. A white cotton dress. A dainty, heart-shaped face that was somehow haunting rather than cute.\n\nShe was illuminated brightly, but the room behind her was dark. The contrast and her pose reminded me a little bit of *Girl With A Pearl Earring*. But it didn’t feel classy, or pensive, or beautiful. Instead it felt… creepy.\n\nEspecially because my husband insisted on hanging it above our bed.\n\n“I mean, it’s a beautiful painting,” I said. “But it just doesn’t fit with the modern décor.”\n\n“Neither do your Funko Pops.”\n\n“Okay, but they’re small. This painting is *enormous.* For Pete’s sake, the woman is nearly life-sized!”\n\n“I want to keep her where she is.”\n\nIt seemed like a big deal to him, so I dropped it. But it wasn’t easy. Sometimes I woke up in the middle of the night with the horrible feeling that I was being watched. Then I’d look up and see her haunting gray eyes staring down at me.\n\nI didn’t get much sleep after that.\n\nAnd there was the one time I swear she moved. “Was her hand always like that?” I asked Eric, after getting into bed one night.\n\n“Hmm?”\n\n“Her left hand. The fingers are kind of open, reaching out behind her. Like she’s waiting for someone to grab her hand.”\n\n“Yeah, she was always like that.”\n\nI could’ve sworn she *wasn’t* always like that. Then again, I generally avoided looking at the painting. It was so uncomfortably realistic. When I stared into those gray eyes, I almost felt like I was making eye contact with a person.\n\nI lasted two weeks. Then I begged Eric to move it.\n\n“Can we *please* move the painting somewhere else? I really hate looking at it when I’m going to sleep.”\n\n“It’s the nicest piece of art we have. It belongs above the bed.”\n\n“What about the sunflower one?”\n\n“That’s just a print,” he complained. “And it’s so basic.”\n\n“Come on. I’ll move my Funko Pops out if you move the painting out.”\n\nHe heaved a long sigh. “Fine. I’ll move her.”\n\nThat was another thing. He often referred to the painting as “her.” It was weird.\n\nSo he moved it to the stairs. But honestly, that was worse. Every time I went downstairs, there she was. Staring at me from above the landing with those piercing gray eyes. At least when the painting was in the bedroom, I was usually asleep or facing the opposite direction.\n\nI hit my breaking point a few days after that.\n\nFor some reason I couldn’t sleep. After tossing and turning for an hour, I decided to grab a snack downstairs. I got to the top of the stairs… and there she was.\n\nI hadn’t turned on the main lights—only the nightlight in the hall bathroom was on. With everything so dark, the background of the painting melted into the shadows. But the woman still stood out, with her pale face and white dress.\n\nAnd my stupid, sleepy brain interpreted it as an actual person standing there.\n\nI jumped about a foot in the air. And I would’ve fallen all the way down the stairs, had I not caught the banister at the last second.\n\n“Can we pleeeease get rid of that painting?” I asked the next morning.\n\nEric turned away from the stove, set the spatula down. “Why?”\n\n“Last night, it scared the frick out of me. I nearly fell down the stairs.”\n\nHe stared at me, as if unable to understand. “She… scared you?” he asked slowly.\n\n“Well, more like startled me. I thought it was actually a person standing there.”\n\nHe looked at me.\n\nThen he broke into laughter. And, after a few seconds, I started laughing too. It *was* pretty stupid, now that I thought about it. I know I was sleepy, but still—I thought the painting was a *person?!* What, did I think we were being burglarized by a young, beautiful, blonde woman in a nightdress?\n\n“For now, I’ll move her into my office. Then you don’t have to look at her at all.”\n\n“That sounds good.”\n\nAnd for a while after that, things were okay. I sort of noticed Eric spending more time in his office than usual, but he also had a big deadline for a brief coming up. And what, how would that be related to the painting, anyway? It’s not like he was staring at her for hours on end.\n\nExcept that’s exactly what I caught him doing.\n\nOne night he didn’t come downstairs to eat dinner with me. I called up to him a few times. No reply. So I went upstairs and walked into his office—to find him staring at her.\n\nHe was just sitting there. With his computer closed. No papers on the desk. Swivel chair turned towards the woman in the painting.\n\n“Oh,” he said suddenly, when I walked in. Then he quickly stood up. “I was just about to come down. Just sent in the brief a few minutes ago. They’re really happy with it.”\n\nHe smiled broadly at me, as if nothing were wrong, and then slipped past me. I listened to his footsteps thump down the stairs.\n\n*Had he actually just finished working?*\n\n*Or was he just sitting in here… staring at her?*\n\nI ultimately decided not to bring it up. The painting was out of my sight and that was great. Besides, I had bigger fish to fry, like my own deadline coming up for an article I hadn’t even started.\n\nBut then, on Friday afternoon, I accidentally overheard him on the phone. His voice was muffled through the thick wooden door, but it wasn’t hard to hear him. He was shouting, almost.\n\n*“I’ll have it in by tonight—”*\n\n*“No, I knew it was due on Wednesday—”*\n\n*“Well, my wife fell down the stairs. I had to take her to the hospital.”*\n\nThose words sent a chill through me. I barged in.\n\n“Why are you lying about me falling down the stairs?”\n\nHis face paled. He ended the call and turned towards me. “I’m so sorry, Tara. But I needed an excuse. I missed the deadline on that brief, and it’s my job on the line—\"\n\n“The brief you told me you finished two days ago?”\n\nHe nodded, silently.\n\nI crossed my arms. “Look, Eric, your work is your business. But we’ve spent, like, all of one hour together all week. Because you’ve been locked in here all day, every day. I mean, are you even working? Or are you just sitting in here, staring at *her?*”\n\nHis dark eyes locked on mine. And then his voice grew soft. \n\n“You’re jealous of her.”\n\n“… *What?!”*\n\n“You shouldn’t be, Tara,” he said, stepping towards me. “The painting makes her prettier than she was.”\n\nI froze. Stared at him.\n\nThen I finally found the words. “Are you saying… this is a painting of someone you know?”\n\n“No,” he said slowly. “Sorry, I misspoke. I meant, whoever this is a portrait of, I’m sure it’s a flattering likeness. All portraits are flattering like that.”\n\nI stared at him, my heart pounding in my chest.\n\n“Who is this a painting of, Eric?”\n\n“I told you, it’s not—”\n\n“Eric.” I stepped towards him. My legs felt weak, wobbling underneath me. “*Who is this a painting of?!”*\n\nHe only shook his head.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI couldn’t sleep that night.\n\nI know, it sounds silly, being so worked up over a painting. But you have to admit it was weird. He was obsessed with this thing, for whatever reason. *Why didn’t I see the painting when we were dating? Did he hide it away in the basement?* That was the one place I’d never been. Had he built a little shrine down there, painting, candles, the whole nine yards?\n\nThe thought of it made me sick.\n\n*Is it an ex-girlfriend? An ex-wife, even, that he never told me about?* Getting a painting commissioned must have cost a fortune. Especially a huge, detailed one like this. I mean, as much as I hated that thing, it was clearly done by someone incredibly gifted. The glint in those piercing gray eyes, the small dimple on her right cheek…\n\nBut clearly he wasn’t keeping it to appreciate the artistry.\n\n*He knew her.*\n\n*And whoever she is, he’s obsessed with her.*\n\nAnd then I got the craziest idea.\n\nI sat up in bed. Slowly, quietly. Turned to Eric. He was fast asleep. Then I slipped out from underneath the covers, grabbed my phone from the nightstand—and tiptoed out of the room.\n\nMy bare feet padded softly across the hallway as I made my way towards his office. Then I pushed the heavy wooden door open and stepped inside.\n\nThe office was cold—much colder than our bedroom. Goosebumps pricked up my bare arms. But I didn’t waste any time. I reached over, fumbling across the wall, and hit the switch.\n\nThe light flicked on.\n\nThe blonde woman stared down at me from the wall. Her eyes seemed to follow me as I took Eric’s leather chair and dragged it across the hardwood. Once against the wall, I stepped up onto it.\n\nWe were staring at each other, face to face.\n\nI’d never been this close to the painting before. My face inches from hers. This close, I could truly appreciate the detail. Each individual eyelash painstakingly drawn, curving up from its follicle. Threadlike striations of light and dark gray filling her irises. Her skin, so pale and creamy, dotted with the tiniest of pores.\n\nBut I wasn’t here to appreciate the artwork.\n\nI lifted my phone—and took a photo.\n\nThen I brought up a reverse image search.\n\nIt took a few minutes for me to find the right website and upload the photo. But when the results loaded… I gasped.\n\nI expected maybe one result, if I were lucky. Some sort of facial recognition that would match the painted face to a photo. Or, maybe the artist’s website would come up, and mention who the subject was. But instead—*dozens* of thumbnails filled the page. Of the exact same painting I’d been staring at for weeks.\n\nFingers trembling, I clicked on the first one. It led to a news article.\n\n**Search Continues for Missing Franklin Art Student**\n\nMy heart dropped. Little black dots danced in my vision. I collapsed into the chair behind me, trembling, and began to read.\n\n*Anya Kelsing, 23, went missing after a hike with her boyfriend…*\n\n*The two became separated when they came upon a bear…*\n\n*Her backpack was found roughly a mile from where the sighting occurred, but no trace of Anya was found…*\n\nAnd the caption under the painting.\n\n*Kelsing is a third-year student at Franklin College, majoring in Fine Arts. She recently completed a self-portrait that was exhibited at Le Coeur (above)*\n\nI clicked on the next article, and the next—but they all said the same thing. Hike, bear, disappearance. All of them showed a photo along with her self-portrait; she looked strikingly identical to her painted likeness. None of them mentioned the boyfriend’s name, but it had to be Eric. The most recent article, from five years ago, was a video clip of her parents begging for her search to continue. Sadly, judging by the news articles, it never did.\n\nI don’t know how long I sat there. All I know is that I was suddenly jolted from my thoughts by a loud *thump* in the hallway.\n\nFootsteps. Coming towards the office.\n\nI shot up. *He can’t find me here.* I glanced around the room, looking for someplace—any place—that I could hide. But it was probably too late. Surely he’d seen the light on, from under the door…\n\nI ducked under the desk just as he stepped into the room.\n\n“Tara?”\n\nI clapped my hand over my mouth, trying to silence my ragged breathing. *He’s going to see the chair out of place. He knows I’m here. He knows…*\n\n“Tara, you in here?”\n\n*Why did I hide? I could’ve just said I came in here because I heard a noise. Needed a pen. Couldn’t sleep. Why the fuck did I hide? Now he’s going to know that I know…*\n\n“Tara?”\n\n*But maybe it’s fine. Maybe the bear got Anya, maybe Eric had nothing to do with it. Isn’t that more likely than Eric being a murderer?*\n\n“There you are.”\n\nI looked up—and screamed.\n\nEric was crouched there, in front of the desk, staring at me.\n\n“I—I was looking for a pen,” I stuttered, lamely. “I wanted to write down—I remembered I have to pick up groceries tomorrow and I needed to add something…”\n\nHe tilted his head, a small smile on his lips. “I don’t think that’s the truth, Tara.”\n\n*Make a break for it.*\n\nI started to lunge out from under the desk. His hand quickly shot out and grabbed my wrist. *Hard.* “You figured out who she is, didn’t you? That’s the only reason you’d be hiding from me.”\n\nI trembled in his grasp. “What did you do to her?” I whispered.\n\nHe let out a dry laugh. “So you think I’m a murderer. How nice, that’s the first conclusion you jump to.”\n\n“No—no, I don’t think you’re a murderer.” I swallowed. *Stupid, stupid, stupid. If he killed her, and he knows you know… then you’re dead too.* “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that. Just… what happened? They didn’t find a body. Did the bear get her?”\n\nHe didn’t reply. Just stared at me, silently, with those cold dark eyes.\n\n“I was jealous,” I continued, desperately, “but now I understand. I wish you’d just told me. To lose someone like that… of course you’d want to keep the painting. It’s all you have left of her.”\n\n“You should have just left it alone,” he said, his tone oddly emotionless. “I’m sorry you had to find out this way.”\n\nI screamed as he lunged for me.\n\n*It’s over.* His hands were clenched tight on my wrists as he dragged me out from under the desk. I pulled back, trying to wrench myself free, but it was no use—\n\n*Thump!*\n\nA loud crash sounded behind us. Eric whipped around, and for a split second—his grip released.\n\nI acted instantly. Pulled free from him and ran, pivoting around the desk and racing towards the door. As I glanced back, I saw Eric, starting after me.\n\nBut I also saw what had made the noise.\n\nThe painting of Anya had fallen from the wall. It lay askew on the floor, her gray eyes staring emptily upwards.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI was always a fast runner.\n\nEric was only halfway down the stairs by the time I was at the bottom. Bursting out into the cold air, I began to scream. He grabbed me from behind and tried to pull me back inside, but it was too late. Lights were flicking on. Our neighbor rushed out of his house, dialing 911.\n\nIt was over.\n\nThe police arrested Eric for assault. And once I told them my story, of his obsession with Anya’s painting, they were able to search our house. And hidden in his office drawer, in a small box, was a pair of gold earrings.\n\nThe same earrings Anya wore on the hike that day.\n\nThe case is slowly mounting against him. I’m hoping, praying Anya gets justice and that a jury convicts him of her horrible murder.\n\nAnd would he have done the same to me, if I hadn’t escaped? If Anya’s painting hadn’t fallen off the wall?\n\nThere was an explanation, of course. When Eric had moved the painting to his office, he’d mistakenly installed one of the hangers into pure drywall. The weight of the painting had caused it to rip out, and the painting fell.\n\nBut sometimes, I think Anya was watching over me. That her self-portrait carried a piece of her. And that night, she’d protected me from falling victim to the monster who ended her life.\n\nThe painting now hangs up in my foyer. Every day I walk by it, and new details pop out at me: the deep, shadowy green of the room behind her. A perfectly-painted strand of blonde hair. The glint in her piercing gray eyes.\n\nAnd sometimes, I think she’s smiling back at me."},"227":{"title":"My wife has a removable face. I’ve never glimpsed what lies beneath it, but my best friend has.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/hhmlt9\/my_wife_has_a_removable_face_ive_never_glimpsed\/","flair":null,"author":"nslewis","selftext":"Samantha told me about it on our third date. We were watching a movie on her couch when I made my move to kiss her. She whipped her hand in front of my face and blocked me.\n\n“There’s something you need to know,” she said.\n\nI braced myself. *Here it comes. “I’m not ready for a relationship. Nothing to do with you, of course.”* It was the absolute last thing that I wanted to hear, because I was already crazy about her.\n\n“Okay,” I said.\n\n“I have a removable face.”\n\n*That’s a new one.* “You have a what now?” I was about to laugh, but she was wearing a deadly serious expression.\n\n“I have a removable face.”\n\n“Is that, like, a metaphor or something?”\n\n“No. My face is literally removable. Look. Closely.” She lifted her chin and traced her jaw line with a finger. “You can see the seam.”\n\nAfter admiring how beautiful her neck was for a dizzying moment, I leaned in for an inspection. It was very hard to see, but it *did* look like there was a slightly unnatural transition there from her face to her throat. I grew dizzier, as a dozen questions rushed into my brain.\n\n“Don’t bother asking why or how or anything like that,” said Samantha. “I can’t tell you that. If that’s going to be a problem, you should leave now. I’m letting you know this because I like you, and I want to take the next step, but this is non-negotiable.”\n\n“Okay,” I said, unsure of what was happening. “Not a problem. So what? You have a removable face. Who cares? It looks good.”\n\n“There’s something else. Once a day, usually in the evening, I have to remove the face and disinfect the inside of it. If I don’t, it will rot. This takes about an hour, give or take, depending on how my day went. During this time, you must never *ever* look at my real face. *Never*. Do you understand?”\n\n“Y… yes. Got it. Don’t ask about it, don’t look at your… ‘real’ face.”\n\nSamantha stood up. “Now, I’m going to go into the bathroom and clean my face. That will give you plenty of time to think about what I’ve told you. If you’re here when I’m done… that’s great. I would like that. But if you’re gone… I’ll understand.”\n\nShe turned and walked into her bedroom. I sat in stunned silence as I heard the bathroom door close.\n\nI gave the thing some serious thought. It was possible that it was a joke of some kind. It was possible that it was a delusion. Was it possible that it was true? Well, it was certainly possible to transform an actor’s face with movie makeup, so I supposed it was possible that Samantha wore a “removable face” every day. Maybe she had had a horrible accident where her flesh had been mangled. Maybe her face had been melted by acid, or burned by fire, or the skin shorn off by heavy machinery. If it had, I would never know, because she would never tell me, and I would never see it.\n\nI pictured a face of raw, naked muscle, rotting away. Could I kiss her, if that was what I was kissing? But wasn’t that what we all were, under the skin? Just muscle and bone and blood and squishy organs.\n\nI paced around the living room, running my hand through my hair. I liked Samantha, a lot. She was smart, and funny… and beautiful. But was that beauty *real*? Did it count? Did it matter if it was “real” or not? Was I being superficial even worrying about it?\n\nWhen she came out of the bathroom, I was still there. I looked at her face. She smiled and I was in love.\n\n\\*\n\nWe dated, we moved in together, we decided to get married.\n\nFor the most part, it was a completely normal relationship, typical of two young people in love, building a life together. During the day, it was easy to forget about the face altogether. It looked natural enough, and only in certain positions, in certain lights, was there ever any indication that it *wasn’t* natural.\n\nBut every night was the same. Samantha would close herself in the bathroom – sometimes for an hour, sometimes for two – and clean the inside of her face. The curiosity never left me. I would sit there and wonder what was under that face. I came so close to barging in on her a few times, but I never did.\n\nI *did* occasionally ask her about it. About what, if anything, had happened. About how it was possible to make the removable face look so real. About what it really looked like underneath. I tried to coax her into showing me, assuring her that I loved her no matter what, and didn’t give a damn what her real face looked like… I was just curious, that’s all.\n\nShe never showed me, or told me the story behind it. She didn’t get upset at me (unless I was really badgering her.) She’d just shrug and say, “You know you can’t see it. You know I can’t tell you about it.”\n\n\\*\n\nI never told anybody about Samantha’s removable face. It’s not that she asked me not to. I just didn’t think it was anybody’s business.\n\nExcept once, I did tell somebody.\n\nIt was during my bachelor’s party. We had rented several cabins in Big Sur and spent the night drinking and packing our noses with powders that we shouldn’t have been packing our noses with. Everyone else had passed out and the sun was creeping up behind us as I stood on the majestic cliffs with my friend Chris, looking down on the pacific waves crashing against the rocks.\n\nChris was my best friend; as close to a brother as I’d known. We’d grown up together, and visited each other at college often, and spent the summers together. After college, we’d moved to different cities, but we stayed in close contact.\n\nStanding there on the cliffs, I told Chris about Samantha’s removable face. At first, he thought I was joking. Then he had a thousand questions, most of which I couldn’t answer.\n\n“What’s underneath?”\n\n“I don’t know, man. I don’t know.”\n\n“Doesn’t that drive you crazy, not knowing?”\n\nI shrugged. “Lots of stuff I don’t know. Don’t know how to do calculus, and I don’t know what happens when we die.”\n\n“But dude, she’s about to be your *wife*. And you don’t even know what she *looks like*. I mean, I’d have to take a look. Like, you could set a camera up in the bathroom. That’s where she does it, right? Set up a camera and have a look and then you’ll know.”\n\nI sighed. “Yeah, it drives me crazy. I’ve asked her a million times. But she told me I could never look. Gotta respect that, man, even if I don’t like it. That’s love.”\n\nChris laughed. “*You* telling *me* to respect a woman? Up is down now.”\n\nThen we fell back into talking about old times as a new day dawned.\n\n\\*\n\nChris was in town for business last week, and planned on spending the weekend at our house. The conversation at Big Sur had happened four years ago, and we hadn’t spoken about Samantha’s removable face since, despite keeping in close contact and seeing each other as often as two people transforming into adults in different parts of the country can.\n\nIt happened on Saturday evening. We were lounging lazily in the backyard, deep into the beer, having just finished with some grilled steaks, when I got a text from work.\n\n“Goddammit,” I groaned. “I have to make a work call.”\n\n“Seriously?” said Samantha, raising an artificial eyebrow. “On a Saturday night?”\n\n“My biggest client, baby. Sorry.”\n\n“It is what it is, I guess,” said my wife. “I’m going to head inside and get cleaned up. Chris? Are you okay just hanging out for a bit?”\n\nChris smiled. “I'll be fine. Got my beer, got some weeds to pull in your garden. God knows your lazy-ass husband isn’t going to do it. Those tomatoes are choking to death. It’s a tragedy.”\n\nI rolled my eyes and went into the side yard to make my call.\n\n15 minutes into it, I heard the screams coming from inside. Both my best friend and my wife were wailing in terror.\n\nI dropped the phone and ran into the house and down the hall to our bedroom. Through the open door, I could see that the door to the master bathroom was also standing open.\n\n“Don’t come in!” screamed Samantha. “I don’t have my face on! Call an ambulance! He looked! Oh God, he looked!” She sounded desperate, and truly horrified. That made me desperate and horrified, and I wanted to rush into the bathroom, but I knew suddenly that that would be a mistake.\n\nI knew suddenly that Samantha didn’t want me to look at her real face not out of a sense of vanity, but for my own safety.\n\nChris staggered backwards, out of the bathroom. He was holding a straightened out paperclip, which he had used to pick the privacy lock. Now he was stabbing it again and again into his eyes, shouting gibberish. He was clearly in the depths of madness, and it turned my stomach to see him mutilate himself.\n\n“Call a fucking ambulance!” my wife screamed. “Don’t come in here! He fucking LOOKED!”\n\nI turned and ran back to the side yard, where my phone was lying in the newly mowed grass. My client was still on the line, alarmed, asking what was happening, what all the screaming was. I hung up on him and called 911.\n\nWhen the paramedics arrived, Chris was having a seizure in the hallway. Samantha was stroking his head, sobbing. Her face was on, but it had been done hastily, and everything looked a little off.\n\n\\*\n\nMy world has been dark this past week.\n\nMy best friend is in a psychiatric hospital under suicide watch. He’s completely blind and mostly catatonic, except when he slips into a violent, babbling mania. The doctors are optimistic that his state is temporary, but they don’t know the truth about what caused it, because I told the paramedics that Chris had taken a large dose of psychedelic mushrooms and fallen into psychosis.\n\nI saw no good reason to tell the truth about what had happened. Who would believe that one look at my wife’s “real” face would make somebody insane? At best, we would be the subjects of a long investigation; at worst, we would have to prove that what we were saying was true, by showing somebody Samantha’s face. Then the same thing would happen again, and what after that? I had no idea, and no interest in finding out. For Samantha’s part, I knew that she would never consent to show anybody her real face, no matter what the consequences of refusal were.\n\nI did get a follow-up call from the police, asking me to confirm my story. The hospital found no traces of psilocybin in Chris’ blood, though that’s not unheard of, since it has a short half-life. If they end up testing his hair, I will likely be in a lot of trouble. But that’s truly the least of my concerns.\n\nSamantha is in a state of her own. She still cleans the inside of her face, though not as regularly, and when she puts it back on, it’s always crooked now. It is beginning to smell a little bit.\n\nI’ve tried to assure her that it wasn’t her fault. “He *knew*,” I said. “I told him that nobody was ever allowed to look at it. He *knew* and then he *broke into the bathroom.* This is not on you, baby. Please. Talk to me.”\n\n“Not on me? That one look at my fucking *face* makes people insane? Please. I just need some time alone.”\n\nAs for me, I am doing my best to hold it together. Do you know what’s strange, though? Despite what happened to Chris, I still find myself curious about what my wife’s real face looks like. More curious than ever, really."},"228":{"title":"My Sleep Paralysis Demon is Actually A Pretty Chill Guy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/imhzg1\/my_sleep_paralysis_demon_is_actually_a_pretty\/","flair":null,"author":"writechriswrite","selftext":"My first memory of sleep paralysis happened when I was ten years old. I remember because it was the night my parents took me to see Shrek 2 for getting good marks on my report card. It was an evening show, so we got in late and my mom tucked me straight into bed when we got home.\n\nIt was around four am when I woke up, the light from my alarm clock told me that much. I couldn't feel anything, not my pajamas against my skin, or the warmth of my head against the pillow. I could feel my arms and legs, but they felt heavy, as if a great weight was holding them down. \n\nI tried to call out but I couldn’t, my voice caught in my throat, my lips unable to move. I mustered a weak groan that sounded like a cross between a frog’s croak and a zombie’s moan, but that was it. \n\nI thought I was dead, that this is what death feels like, being awake but unable to move or tell anyone. My mind wrestled with the idea of being placed in a coffin, unable to tell anyone I was still alive in here, unable to move or say anything as the lid closed and they put me in the ground, still alive.\n\nMy fear subsided as I felt my heart thudding in my chest in response to my near panic attack. I also became aware of my breathing, which slowed as the fear subsided. I calmed a little, thinking it was just a dream.\n\nThat was when I saw him for the first time. Mr. BrownStickLegs.\n\nHe huddled in the corner of the room by my closet. His two oversized red eyes glowed in the dark of my bedroom. His face was like a porcelain mask, white, expressionless, with no mouth or nose, only those two haunting red eyes. \n\nWhen he stood up, his body unfolded like origami until his head reached the ceiling. His neck bent, tilting forward as his true height was greater than the height of my room. His long black torso was covered in shimmering symbols that reflected red in the light of his glowing eyes. He stood on two spindly thin legs that disappeared into the shadows of the room. \n\nHe made no noise as he moved, seeming to glide as he hovered closer to my bed. His long thin arms reached down to me as I moaned through paralyzed lips. I could not scream, even though I very much wanted to.\n\nHis fingers reaching through the darkness, down to my face. Two pointed fingers touched against my eyelids, pushing them closed. I remember his fingertips feeling cool, but not cold. Even though the ends of his fingertips looked sharp, his touch was gentle.\n\n“Do not struggle, little one. Sleep, sleep,” he said. His voice was so deep I could feel it in my chest when he spoke.\n\nI did as instructed, convincing myself that it indeed was a dream. Even if it wasn’t, the back of my eyelids was more reassuring than looking into those piercing red eyes in his vacant mask of a face. I closed my eyes, wanting it to be a dream, willing it to be a dream. I woke up the next morning, thankfully able to move, walk and talk.\n\nI explained what I saw to my parents, who both agreed that it was a dream. My mom tried floating the idea that something from Shrek 2 scared me but neither my dad or I bought it. For confirmation, dad asked that I draw a picture of what I saw for them. As I was drawing, I ran out of black crayon and had to finish his legs with the next darkest color in my crayon box. \n\n“Hey there, Mister BrownStickLegs,” my Dad said as I handed him the drawing. “You leave my daughter alone now, you hear?”\n\nThis is how my sleep paralysis demon ended up with the name Mr. BrownStickLegs. \n\nGiving him a silly name helped take some of the edge off of going to bed the following night. My dad even did a sweep of the room, calling out for him. “Here Mr. BrownStickLegs,” he said, whistling as if he were calling a dog. It made me giggle and the whole episode felt more fun than scary.\n\nBut once they tucked me in and turned off the light, I felt the dread creeping back in. Darkness hits harder when you expect to find something lurking in the shadows. I don’t know how long I searched, but I eventually fell asleep.\n\nIn the weeks following, I searched for Mr. BrownStickLegs every night as I fell asleep. Even when I went to sleepovers I would do a cursory check in case he tagged along to a friends house. As time passed, my searches became less frequent. \n\nIt was a couple months later, the night before my first day of 5th grade when I woke up to Mr. BrownStickLegs straddled over my bed, his empty plate of a face inches from my own.\n\nA scream stuck in my throat, coming out sounding like a gush of air releasing from a pool float.\n\n“Hush, child,” he said. His voice was deep, echoless. I didn’t know how he spoke without a mouth, but I heard him nonetheless.\n\nI saw that he held a piece of paper in his thin fingers, crumpled on the edges and torn. He held it up to show me.\n\nOn the page was a pink blob with blue dots for eyes and a droll red smile and stick lines for legs and arms. It was lying on a blue rectangle.\n\n“I found the picture you drew of me. So I drew a picture of you,” he said. “Do you like it?”\n\nI tried nodding, but I couldn’t move. I tried answering, but all that came out was the same dry croaking sound. \n\n“Will you draw another one for me? I so liked the first one, you gave me pants. I look good in pants.”\n\nAgain, I was unable to respond or move to give him an answer. He must’ve been able to read my intent, because he tucked the picture under my pillow before closing my eyes again. \n\nWhen I woke up in the morning, I bolted upright and tossed my pillow off the bed. My heart leapt into my throat when I found the picture. It wasn’t a dream. He was real. \n\nI went to my desk and began drawing a picture for him, starting with his face and eyes, trying to capture as much detail as I could remember. I had forgotten all about the first day of school until my mom opened my door and found me still in my pajamas.\n\n“Lexi!” she yelled, startling me as I was coloring in his eyes. “Your bus will be here in less than an hour, get dressed NOW!”\n\nI tucked my picture into my school backpack and got dressed. \n\nI finished my drawing at recess that day, using my brand new Crayola 64 pack that I got with my back to school supplies. I gave him blue pants this time, figuring he’d like to see himself in jeans. I wrote his name, “Mr. BrownStickLegs” at the bottom of the picture and drew a smileyface next to it, hoping he’d like his nickname. \n\nI flipped the paper over to write him a message on the back. I wanted to ask him questions, but didn’t want to anger him since he visited me when I was at my most vulnerable. I wrote out my letter on a separate piece of paper before copying it over to the back of my picture.\n\n*Dear Mr. BrownStickLegs (that’s your name),*\n\n*My name is Lexi. I am in the fifth grade. What is your name? How old are you? Do you go to school? Why do you visit my bedroom? Why can’t I move when you visit? You look scary but you also seem nice. I hope we can be friends.*\n\n*Love,*  \n*Lexi*\n\n*P.S. I hope you like your blue pants!*\n\nI added another smileyface at the end of the letter, my final emphasis on wanting to be friends. I considered closing with Sincerely, but I figured Love was a better, friendlier choice.\n\nI tucked the picture under my pillow that night, now anxious to see him rather than filled with dread of his reappearance. But like the last time, he did not return the next day. Or the day after. The days stretched into weeks, and every morning I found the picture tucked under my pillow from the night before. \n\nIt wasn’t until Thanksgiving break that I saw him again. My eyes opened as the morning sun poked through the blinds of my bedroom. His body didn’t look any different in the light; in fact, his black skin seemed darker, absorbing the sun’s rays without giving anything back. His eyes seemed wider than before; if he had a mouth I would have figured he was smiling. In his slender fingers was the picture I drew for him.\n\n“Hello Lexi,” he said. “Thank you for the picture, I do look good in blue pants.”\n\nI wanted to smile, but, well, sleep paralysis.\n\nHe flipped the picture over to the side with my letter.\n\n“I will answer your questions the best I can. I do not have a name, not one you could ever pronounce, but I am happy for you to call me Mr. BrownStickLegs. As for my age, I exist outside of the construct of time, therefore I am ageless. I do not go to school, nor do I know what school is. Why do I visit you? I visit to feed on the energy of your soul.”\n\nMy breath quickened as a mute groan exited my teeth. I wanted to run, wanted to get away from him, but I was pinned down, unable to move.\n\nHe sensed my uneasiness and tried to calm me by patting my forehead.\n\n“Let me explain. Have you been to the ocean? It appears vast, almost limitless as you stare out into the blue water, with no visible land on the other side?”\n\nIn my mind I was standing on a beach. I felt the salty ocean breeze against my face as I looked out over the massive body of water. The waves crashed at my feet. I felt the rush of water over them followed by the trickle of sand and pebbles as the water drew back.\n\n“Your soul is like an ocean, child. Vast, limitless, undefinable by words to your understanding. I take only a tiny sip, a single glass of water from a vast ocean. I am not one who could consume an entire ocean.”\n\nDark clouds formed over the water as I stared at the whitecapped waves. The clouds unleashed a heavy downpour, turning the horizon grey as rain fell from the sky over the ocean.\n\n“Just as the rain falls over the ocean, your soul can replenish itself by more than I could ever consume, not even in a thousand of your years. Does that make you feel better?”\n\nOn the beach in my mind’s vision, I nodded. In my bedroom, he nodded back at me.\n\n“Good. As for your last question, why you cannot move, we are meeting at a point outside of your time, where your world and mine touch. Your physical body cannot move here but if you persist you can learn to speak to me with your mind, and I will answer your questions in exchange for your drawings. You can draw pictures of whatever you like, I want to know more of your world.”\n\nIn my mind, I nodded again.\n\n“This knowledge is a gift so we can understand one another more. I am not one who would hurt you.”\n\nHe pressed his fingertips to my eyelids again, closing them. In my mind’s eye, I was still on the beach, but the sun was setting, and no stars were visible through the rain. I drifted back to sleep to the sound of falling rain.\n\nThe next morning I asked my parents for a sketchbook and colored pencils. They tried to hold me off until Christmas, but since I spent most of my afternoons and weekends drawing pictures up in my room, Dad let me open one of my gifts a week early, a Strathmore sketchbook with 100 pages with a 50 pack of Crayola colored pencils. \n\nI started by drawing the rest of my family, Mom, Dad, my little brother Tommy, our cat Libby, and even though he had died, our dog Pancakes. Next I drew our house, then our car, then my school. I kept drawing anything I could think of, trees, birds, insects, until my sketchbook was full. I used my allowance to purchase more books so I could keep drawing. I honed my craft, redoing my earlier drawings in greater detail.\n\nMy thoughts considered his wording, “I am not one who could consume an entire ocean.” I wanted to ask him if there were those who could, but I wasn’t sure if I wanted to know such things.\n\nMr. BrownStickLegs didn’t return until my Freshman year of high school. To him, it wasn’t like any time had passed.\n\nI read up on lucid dreaming in the time between visits so that when he returned I would be better capable of talking to him. He held my book in his hands, flipping through my drawings, doting over the increased refinement of my drawing skills. I had filled a dozen sketchpads and upgraded from Crayola to Prismacolor Premier pencils for my drawings. \n\nHis biggest surprise was when after he complimented my drawings I spoke to him.\n\n“Thank you.” I said, seeing the words in my mind as I spoke them aloud.\n\nIf he had a surprised expression, his eyes showed it.\n\n“You have been very busy, child,” he said. “Do you have any questions you would like to ask?”\n\nI hesitated, but finally formed the words in my mind. “Are there creatures who can consume an entire ocean?”\n\nHe didn’t respond right away, which made me think I had not asked properly. As I asked him a second time, he put a finger to my lips as if to shush me.\n\n“There are those who can. They are known as the Dark Ones. They are capable of consuming entire souls, emptying them out, leaving them dry and barren. You should not fear them, but you should also not provoke them.”\n\nHis eyes curved downward, as if concerned or afraid.\n\n“What do they look like?” I asked.\n\nIn my mind, my visions were filled with images of great, terrible creatures. Spiders taller than the Empire State Building on thin spindly legs of shadow and smoke. Tentacled monsters in the seas lofting blue whales like they were toys, ripping them to shreds with their curved chitinous beaks. Great, gastly flying creatures that knocked over orchards and forests with the beat of their leathery wings. \n\n“I showed you only because you ask,” Mr. BrownStickLegs said, “but it is best that we don’t talk or think about them. Let them be.”\n\nI nodded in my mind.\n\nHe leaned forward and pressed his plate like face to my head as if to kiss me on the forehead, which was odd since he didn’t have a mouth. Then, as usual, he closed my eyes and I drifted back to sleep.\n\nMy life took a downturn during the latter years of high school. My Dad lost his job, and when the search for a new one dragged on, he turned to drinking to cope with his failure. He wasn’t abusive, but he wasn’t fun to be around either. \n\nIn the months following, my parents would hush their arguing when I entered the room, greeting me with smiles as if nothing were wrong. That lasted until the day I came home from school to them fighting over a foreclosure notice from the bank. We moved out over a weekend from our home in the suburbs to an apartment on the other side of town.\n\nI internalized my feelings during that time. I withdrew from my friends and school activities besides the art club, the only one we could still afford. I saw my friends driving to school and hanging out while I rode the bus, too poor and too far out of the way to join in. \n\nMy tastes began to change as well. Out was the bubblegum pop of Katy Perry, Ke$ha, and Taylor Swift. Instead I listened to Pierce the Veil, Sleeping with Sirens, and Bring Me The Horizon. My clothes and makeup became darker, more black t-shirts and skirts with black eyeliner and black fingernail polish. Mom called it my goth phase, not that she understood.\n\nMy drawings became darker too. I moved from colored pencils to charcoal, drawing skulls and gothic looking cemeteries as my passion for drawing animals and flowers waned. \n\nI also drew the Dark Ones, in great detail, exactly how I remembered them in my mind’s eye.\n\nMr. BrownStickLegs visited me again a month after we moved into the apartment. He looked more at home in my room of black light posters and deathmetal bands than he did in my previous room. His eyes were dim, not the vibrant red as they were before.\n\nHe stared at me as I lay in bed, unable to move. He moved inches from my face as I heard his words in my mind.\n\n“Your soul tastes different now.”\n\nHe didn’t speak of my drawings. I worried that he might, especially since I had been drawing the Dark Ones. Not only drawing them, but thinking about them, and what type of damage they could do if they were to wake.\n\nHe seemed sad for me, although reading his expression was difficult with no face. He patted my forehead like before, but didn’t close my eyes before leaving as he used to.\n\nMy life continued its spiraling path like a bottle rocket with a broken stick. My parents didn’t talk outside of short conversations about which bills to pay and which ones to ignore. Each night, Dad disappeared into a bottle while Mom disappeared online to chat with a male Facebook friend she knew from high school. \n\nThe thing about rock bottom is that it’s often a disguise for a trap door that drops you to an even lower depth than you thought possible.\n\nThe first bottom came when my father died. Drove off the road into a gravel pit late at night with an empty bottle of bourbon in the passenger seat. I cried, but it felt hollow. I felt hollow. Even when mom tried to hold me, I felt nothing inside, not sadness, not guilt, not anything.\n\nI disappeared into my sketchbooks, drawing even darker, more disturbing images. Death, dismemberment, vividly accurate vivasections of the cute animals I used to enjoy drawing. My friends no longer talked to me, which was fine because I didn’t want to talk to them anymore anyways. I found people to hang out with, not friends, but people who could get me access to moments of chemical induced euphoria to forget about life for a while.\n\nJust like that, the trap door opened, dropping me to a new rock bottom of addiction. One thing I had that in common with my dad, but instead of falling into a bottle, I fell into a needle. I stole money from my Mom’s purse to feed my habits, not that she noticed. She was busy with her old Facebook friend who had moved from online acquaintance to nightly sleepover companion.   When the time came to begin my senior year I didn’t bother going back. \n\n I kept drawing, filling entire sketchbooks with the dark images that reflected my bleak outlook on life. The Dark Ones were prevalent subjects during this period of my life. I drew them feasting on humanity, raking flesh from bone in their jagged teeth behind lips of smoke.\n\nI came home one night to find my mom and her new male friend in the middle of a fight. It was different from her fights with dad, more violent, more physical. When he raised his hand at me for trying to intervene, I decided it was time to bolt. \n\nI left home, hitching rides with anyone with a set of wheels I could manage to put up with for short periods of time. My preference leaned toward those with access to the chemical release I craved. The more I could numb, the more I could escape. \n\nI found certain drug combinations had similar effects to sleep paralysis, where my mind’s ability to control my body’s action became severed. In those moments of numbed paralysis I’d see Mr. BrownStickLegs watching from afar as I dulled the pain. I saw what I perceived as the Dark Ones too, but they weren’t hiding in the shadows like Mr. BrownStickLegs did. \n\nThey were the shadows. \n\nI called out to them as well, for in those moments I wanted nothing more than to be hollowed out and empty, a void so dark no pain could ever penetrate it. When they didn’t answer, I called out to Mr. BrownStickLegs, but he would vanish every time. Perhaps it was all just a drug fueled hallucination.\n\nOverdosing was never my intention. I was pushing too much, trying to find the edge of the void after feeling so low, so very low, searching for that something extra to filter out the background noise. I took it too far, giving myself a near-lethal dose. At one moment, I was lying next to strangers on a stained mattress in an abandoned warehouse. Then came the initial rush of euphoric bliss. And then, nothing.\n\nWhoever I was traveling with at the time dumped me on the curb in front of the ER, making me someone else’s problem. \n\nThis was my rock bottom moment, although at the time, it felt more like freefall.   \n\nI spent three weeks in a coma. I was aware of my surroundings, and could hear the doctors and nurses as they checked my vitals and tended to my cleanliness and upkeep, but I couldn’t move or speak. \n\nAt the end of my third week in the ICU on an incubator, I looked up to find Mr. BrownStickLegs hovering over me, his round red eyes peering through the darkness.\n\n“What have you done to yourself, child?” his voice spoke inside my mind. \n\nIn my mind, I was beside him, standing in the middle of a vast salt flat desert. The ground was cracked and dry in a hexagonal pattern that stretched in all directions.\n\n“This is your soul now, there is nothing left to drink.”\n\nI heard my beep of my heart rate monitor back in my hospital room speed up as fear entered my mind.\n\n“I called out to the Dark Ones,” I said. “I asked for them to come. They emptied me out, emptied my soul.”\n\n“No, my child. **You** did this. You have not replenished, you have only consumed. And now, nothing remains.”\n\nI dropped to my knees in the middle of the salt as I felt a rumbling deep inside the hollow pit of my stomach. \n\nI leaned forward onto my arms, but they were no longer my arms. They were pitch black and empty. I could feel them, but when I looked at them, they were empty voids of smoke and shadow. I stood up on my legs, but they were no longer my legs. The darkness swirled up my torso and down my arms. The emptiness inside me consumed my entire body until only my head remained. \n\n“What’s happening to me?”\n\nI heard a snap as my arms and legs split, forming eight black, spindly thin legs. I collapsed onto them, unable to support myself.\n\nMr. BrownStickLegs glided down in front of my face, his eyes inches from my own.\n\n“As I told you, child, only the Dark Ones have the ability to consume an entire ocean of a soul. That is your fate. That is what you will become.”\n\nBack in the room, my heart rate monitor crashed to a flatline. I felt the cold darkness swirl up my neck to my head as the void consumed me. I was aware of the nurses and doctors huddled around my body, prepping the crash cart, but all I felt was the cold consuming what was left of me.\n\n“Help me,” I uttered. “Please.”\n\nMy physical body jolted from the electric paddles, but I felt nothing. Only the cold darkness. A needle injected into my IV line as they recharged for another burst of electricity. Still I felt nothing. Only cold, only darkness, only the vast emptiness of the void.\n\nMr. BrownStickLegs tilted his head as he stared through his unblinking red eyes. He leaned forward, pressing his plate like face to my forehead. I felt a vibration against my skin, followed by the tingling sensation of heat returning. The darkness receded back down my arms and legs. \n\nAs he pulled back, the red in his eyes had diminished.\n\n“A gift, for the girl who gave me pants.”\n\nA tear formed in my eye. It rolled down my cheek and fell onto the parched landscape below. Before I could say anything, an electronic jolt coursed through my body, pulling me away from the salt flat expanse and back to my hospital room.\n\nThe sinus rhythm of my heart rate monitor returned to normal. I felt the cool gel of the defibrillator paddles against my chest. I remember squeezing the hand of one of the attending nurses, who smiled down at me.\n\n“Look who’s awake.”\n\nI cried, but it was different than before. I felt the pain I had long been avoiding, but I felt something else as well. I felt grateful, and I felt a sense of hope I hadn’t known in a long time.\n\nIt was a long road back from the darkness, but the thing about the road to recovery is that, like a road, it leads to a destination. After years of listless drifting towards the void, having a destination was an important first step in finding self-love.\n\nI reconnected with my mother, who was struggling with her own form of the darkness. We leaned on one another, talking and going to therapy as we worked through the issues that drove us apart. After my release from the hospital I moved back home with her, her Facebook friend long gone. I got my GED and used my many sketchbooks as a portfolio to get an apprenticeship at a tattoo parlor.\n\nI've been clean for four years now, and it feels good to smile again. Granted, I still prefer Pierce the Veil to anything from Katy Perry’s catalogue, and my tattoos and jewelry have more skulls than fluffy bunnies, but that's all on the surface. I no longer crave the darkness to consume me. \n\nI often think about the vision with Mr. BrownStickLegs on the salt flats that night in the hospital. I had not seen him since that night, and I often wonder about the state of my soul since that day. Has it replenished or is it still the dried up barren wasteland that he took me to on the night? \n\nLast night, around three in the morning, I finally got my answer.\n\nI woke up with a heaviness on my chest, arms and legs. At first I felt the grips of fear grabbing hold, much like the first time I experienced it. But then in the dark corner of my room, I saw glowing red eyes staring back at me from the shadows.\n\nIn spite of my sleep paralysis, couldn’t help but smile when I heard his voice call out to me.\n\n[“Child, your soul tastes much better now.”](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/writechriswrite\/comments\/imhx3b\/socialchrissocial\/)"},"229":{"title":"All of the women in my family die at age 27.

He got three daughters instead.\n\nHe hated us all, hated my twin sisters, hated my mother… but hated me most of all because I was the last child my mother had before she died. That didn’t stop him from treating me like his little boy, didn’t stop him from attempting to beat the hatred of my own gender into me. *Quit your crying*, he’d snap, *or you’ll end up like your sniveling bitch of a mother*. After years of that shit, he was shocked that I grew up as a tomboy.\n\nI think he hated that even more because I was just a constant reminder of what he never got to have.\n\nMy mother died when she was only twenty-seven, when I was only four – the coroner ruled her death a natural passing, some weird heart complication that took her in her sleep. My dad, though, he says it was because of her family’s curse. Whenever I came to him, desperate for more information about a mother I never really knew, he never had much to say. I’m convinced he was just drunk since the day she died. *Every woman in her damn family, they die when they’re twenty-seven*, he’d sputter in between belches, his breath reeking of stale beer.\n\nI think the real curse is that my mom was the one to die, and not him.\n\nI wasn’t fully convinced by the ramblings of a perpetually drunk man, but when I lost both of my sisters just months before their twenty-eighth birthday, I knew it couldn’t be a coincidence. Moira was found murdered, her face practically blasted off by a shooter while she was on a jog. Joy took her own life only days later. I was the one who found her, hanging in the bedroom of her apartment as I came to pick her up for Moira’s funeral. She’d been there, swinging from the rafters, all night.\n\nIt’s hard to live a normal life when you know you have an expiration date, especially when it encompasses an entire year. I always dreaded my birthday, which from an early age became associated less with fun and birthday cake and more with worry and funeral caskets. But once Moira and Joy died, my next birthday – twenty-five – was the most dreadful day of my life. Twenty-six was worse, twenty-seven unimaginable.\n\n*This is it*, I thought as I closed all of the blinds in my apartment, downing the last drop of vodka in the bottle. *This is the last year of my life.*\n\nTwenty-seven has been uneventful, to say the least. Why would I make any long-term plans, forge any meaningful relationships when I know they simply cannot last? The worst part of this last year has been simply *not* knowing when my impending death is coming – it could have been any day within the last three hundred and sixty-four. It could be within the next minute.\n\nI must admit I became something of a recluse, my windows always shuttered, additional locks installed in my door, letting the phone ring through to voicemail, hiding under my covers with the lights out whenever I got a knock on my door. I stocked up on preserved foods and various goods that I would need to last the year. I was so paranoid that I even covered my mail slot, stuffed a towel in the space beneath my front door. I didn’t want anything getting through from the outside world – god forbid, an *anthrax letter*.\n\nFalling off the face of the earth didn’t matter much, anyway – I didn’t have friends or family anymore. My mother and both of my sisters were dead, and my dad disowned me when I came out as a lesbian after my sisters died. I moved away and severed contact soon after.\n\nThe night before my twenty-seventh birthday, I started getting these strange phone calls from a blocked number. I’ve always had anxiety about phone calls, so I just let it ring. The number kept calling, at least once per day throughout the past year. Then the knocking started, once a week at first, but it’s only been getting worse – more frequent, and the pounding on my door more frantic each time. Convinced it had something to do with my inevitable death, I’ve been driven mad by the unknown visitor, especially over the past week.\n\nI got ready for bed last night, knowing that tomorrow – today, now – is the day I will turn 28. My time had run out, and I searched for comfort in a bottle of liquor. I didn’t find it. I fell into bed, drunk and delirious, and prayed the morning wouldn’t come, though I knew it would. I eventually got to sleep, but it was restless and unsatisfying. The kind of sleep where you feel like you have one eye open, always watching.\n\nThat’s why I was quick to wake when the door to my bedroom creaked open early in the morning, before the first sign of light. I shot up in my bed, glancing around my room in a frenzied panic, at first seeing nothing out of the ordinary other than the door, pushed slightly ajar. A closer look revealed something I’d missed, something that sent my heart racing, froze me to my core. Two dark figures stood in the empty space behind the half-opened door, unmoving, almost like a pair of statues.\n\nWaiting. Watching. Wordless.\n\n“Leave me… leave me alone,” I squeaked, unable to move, paralyzed in the power of their presence.\n\nThe shadowy figures instead shuffled out from behind the door, creeping slowly towards me in the dark. I knew this would certainly be the end of my life, the fulfillment of my curse, if I didn’t act. Suddenly recalling the self-defense methods I’d drilled into my mind, I flipped my bedside lamp on to stun the intruders and reached underneath the table to pull the knife I’d duct taped there a year ago – a twenty-seventh birthday gift to myself.\n\nAs soon as the light flooded the room, though, I knew the blade would be of no use.\n\nMy intruders were not a pair of assassins – not human ones, at least. In the yellow light of the lamp I discerned the identities of the dark figures. They were my sisters. Joy stood at the foot of my bed, pale, in that same conservative black dress I’d found her dead in years ago, the one she’d picked out for Moira’s funeral. Her head hung parallel to her shoulders, neck grotesquely bent from her hanging.\n\nMoira was a few steps behind her. I could only assume it was her, considering the severity of her injuries – she’d suffered a gunshot wound to the head, so brutal that we were not allowed to see her after her death, so intense that it had entirely disfigured her face. The lower half of her face had been reduced to a pit of gore, her jawbone barely attached on one side, her mouth mangled, with only several teeth remaining studded randomly throughout the mess.\n\n“Why are you here?” I cried, gathering my knees to my chest and holding them tight. “Are you… are you here to take me?”\n\nJoy made a feeble attempt to shake her head, the side of her face only brushing weakly against her shoulder. She waited several moments before putting one of her feet in front of the other, moving towards the side of my bed. As I recoiled instinctively, she slowed her pace. Moira trailed after her until they were both beside me.\n\nI whimpered as Joy leaned over me, her head flopping forward suddenly with the motion, neck cracking sickeningly. With her lips brushing against my ear, she whispered, “she… she tried.” Her speech was labored and wheezing, as if her vocal cords had nearly been shredded.\n\n“What do you mean, Joy?” I pleaded.\n\nHer lips moved against my ear once more, but no sounds came out despite a clear strenuous effort. Moira wagered an attempt at answering my query, but only succeeded in sputtering blood from the gaping wound in her face, ejecting one of her remaining teeth onto the floor as her jawbone swung precariously, barely hanging on. She raised one hand, slowly curling it into a fist before striking her knuckles furiously against my bedpost.\n\nThe incessant sounds startling me, I forced my eyes shut tight and pulled my knees even closer against my chest. Moira’s knocking seemed only to escalate in volume, seemed to go on forever, until – finally – it stopped. I cracked my eyes open to find that both of my sisters had vanished, that the light of early morning had begun to spill in through the slats of my blinds. It was just past six o’clock, the seventh of June, the day of my twenty-eighth birthday.\n\nI was born at 9:26 AM – once I learned of the curse, I burned the time of my ultimate expiration into my mind. I only had three hours and sixteen minutes left to live… if I even *had* that long. Draping my covers over my head, I resolved to spend the rest of my life asleep. I figured I’d rather pass peacefully in my sleep like my mother did than to suffer a fate similar to my sisters’.\n\nMy plans were interrupted, however, by that damned knocking on the door. The interruption usually didn’t come so early in the morning. I decided initially to ignore the strange visitor but pulled the blankets back down soon after as a certain sense of familiarity struck me. The pounding on the door reminded me all too much of Moira’s knocking just moments before.\n\nIt easily could have been a trick of the curse, but something compelled me to approach the door. “What do you want?” I called from behind the barrier, clinging to the relative safety it provided.\n\nThe reply came from an unfamiliar man’s voice. “I just have a letter for you, miss.”\n\n“Just… just slide it under the door, and please leave,” I returned, using my bare foot to remove the towel I used to block the small space beneath it.\n\nHe deposited a bright yellow envelope under the door as I requested. I waited quietly for the sounds of receding footsteps before sliding on a pair of gloves to handle the letter. It was addressed to me, simply by first name and with no address. Carefully, I unsealed the envelope to reveal a birthday card. I hadn’t received one in years.\n\nBright, sparkling letters on the front formed the words, *Daughter, you’re 27!*. I scoffed at the sick joke. I hadn’t received a birthday card since I was a child, and my dad couldn’t even get my birthday right. I didn’t think he even knew my address. I cracked it open gingerly to read the message inside.\n\n*Laura,*\n\n*If you’re reading this, your father has killed me. Don’t believe a thing he or the police say – I was not the target of a random attack, I did not die of natural causes, and I certainly did not commit suicide. I would never leave you if I had the choice.*\n\n*The truth is… I died is because I found the truth behind my family’s curse and foolishly told your father. He was in on it the whole time, planted in my life by some secret society to eradicate me. To eradicate us. What we have is not a curse, it is a gift – a gift of immense power. The power to heal, but the power to harm just the same.*\n\n*We come into our power at the age of 28, a number associated with independence, leadership, and self-sufficiency. An age where we can handle the responsibility such a power inevitably comes with. It’s a strong number, and you will come into great strength, though you’ve always been a strong girl.*\n\n*I hope you’ve made it this far, but at the same time… I know you have. You were always a feisty little girl for the four years I had the pleasure of knowing you, of loving you. You never let anyone tell you what to think or do – especially not your father.*\n\n*Happy birthday – I love you.*\n\n*Mom*\n\nI closed the card softly, thinking on the strained words of my sister – mom had tried to warn them, but they didn’t listen. The pieces of the puzzle slid into place… my dad must have murdered Moira, and Joy ended her own life out of grief and a belief that she would inevitably be next.\n\nAt the time of writing this, I only have two hours and thirty-two minutes until I officially turn twenty-eight. Over the past hour or so, I’ve already begun to feel the power flowing into my body, electrifying as it runs through my veins. I will the towel to reposition itself under the door, and it does so, sliding across the floor on its own.\n\nI need to keep myself safe until 9:26, after all.

When she was about thirteen she made this device that honestly still blows my mind. I’ve spent my entire life studying physics and I still don’t know what she did, or how—which is probably for the best considering how this all played out. I don’t know how she did it, but what I do know is in the summer of 2003 the laws governing matter and atomic mass didn’t seem to affect her anymore, she was invisible to the human eye, and she was speaking a universal language we’ve never been able to identify or reproduce.\n\nBefore I get into this, though, have you ever seen Firefly?\n\nAllow me to quote:\n\n*I am very smart.*\n\n*I went to the best medic-ed in Osiris, top 3% of my class; finished my internship in eight months. ‘Gifted’ is the term.*\n\n*So when I tell you that my little sister makes me look like an idiot child, I want you to understand my full meaning.*\n\nThis could have been written about me and my sisters. We come from a long line of gifted people. My father is a neurologist, my mother works for SpaceX, and my eldest sister is an artist whose work has been featured in galleries since she was twelve. I’m a full-time research associate of high energy density physics at a university I can’t name without risking my career. And, like Simon Tam from Firefly before me, I don’t tell you all of this to flaunt our intelligence or to make us look special. I tell you this so you can fully understand what I mean when I say Nirali made us *all* look like idiot children.\n\nIn 2003 I was about to turn seventeen. My interests weren’t like most teen girls, so I won’t bore you with the details of what I found more entertaining than TV, books, or the mall, but more often than not I was occupied with personal research projects. The first time Nirali made herself invisible I was in the middle of a research rabbit hole. I was deep into some really heady academic articles when I heard Nirali pipe up behind me.\n\n“They’re wrong, you know.”\n\nI groaned inwardly. We’d had the knocking talk, but she was still so bad at respecting boundaries. “Nirali, what did we say about knocking?”\n\n“Oh,” she said, and sounded genuinely surprised. “I didn’t think about the door.”\n\n“What?” I frowned and spun my chair around to look at her.\n\nMy room was empty.\n\n*Wait, empty?*\n\nI looked around briefly before rubbing my eyes, wondering when I’d slept last and already writing the conversation off as an auditory hallucination. Shaking my head, I started to turn back to my computer when I heard her giggle.\n\n“Alright, jerkhole. Where are you?”\n\n“Right here,” she giggled, her voice coming from directly in front of me.\n\n“What the—how? Did you hide the speakers again?” I stood up, taking a moment to really look around the room. She’d pulled a prank like this before, hiding a complex set of speakers she’d modified to create a confluence of sound she could manipulate. It would sound like someone was anywhere in the room she specified. She’d even made it sound like she was moving around. It was really impressive, especially since she’d only been ten at the time.\n\nThis time, though, she’d either gotten much better at hiding the speakers or something else was going on.\n\nShe giggled again. “No speakers! Just me!”\n\n“Okay, ‘Just Me’. But how?” I folded my arms, looking in the direction of her disembodied voice.\n\n“That’s going to be hard to explain.”\n\nThat was Nirali for “you won’t get it”.\n\n“Try me,” I said, because I’m stubborn.\n\nShe did, though, and I didn’t. I had the beginnings of a migraine chewing on my right eye by the time she was done. Almost none of it made sense. There was something about atomic frequencies, and post-dimensional drift, superliminal desynchronization, and something she’d dubbed the “Planck Supratemporal Parallel”. It was all way over my head.\n\n“Okay,” I said, rubbing my temple as I tried to digest it all. “But how did you get here.”\n\n“I walked.”\n\n*Infuriating.*\n\n“I mean, how did you get *in* here?” I gestured widely to the door, which was closed, and the walls around us.\n\n“Oh.” I could hear the shrug in her voice. “I just walked where the walls weren’t.”\n\nI squinted at the spot I thought she was standing.\n\n“You… what?”\n\nShe sighed. It was a special sigh. It was the kind of sigh that told you someone much smarter than you was put out at having to dumb something down enough for you to understand. An embarrassed heat flooded my cheeks. I knew she was smarter than me—smarter than all of us—but it still made me feel like I’d failed simple math in front of Neil DeGrasse Tyson and a puppy, and they were both disappointed.\n\n“I walked where the walls weren’t. The walls aren’t everywhere, Divya. In fact, in most places, like… realities? The walls aren’t there at all. So I just walked in those places.”\n\nI wanted to see the proofs of this statement, though I knew she wouldn’t have bothered writing them down except in scraps and incomplete snippets that only made sense to her. I also knew the proofs wouldn’t make any more sense than her original explanation. Even so, it bothered me that I only understood what she meant in the vaguest, most conceptual way. It wasn’t natural for me. That abstractness of thought warred with the linear way of my brain making actual understanding impossible and I hated it.\n\nSana would have understood. Her brain worked that way. But not mine.\n\nI must have looked like I was struggling with it (and I was), because she continued on.\n\n“Where I am, or technically when and how, everything is a Schrödinger’s puzzle of Is and Isn’t. All I have to do is observe the places where the state of something Isn’t and go there.”\n\nThis wasn’t helping. I mean, it was—I got the basic concept of what she was saying, but in terms of the practical application of physics it was a mess of meaningless sciencey buzz words. Nothing she said had any foundation in known science. She could have told me “I ate ice cream upside down and chanted ‘purple’ backwards thirty times and the wall turned to Jell-O, but only as long as I looked at it from a forty-five-degree angle,” and it would have been exactly as scientifically sound as what she’d actually said.\n\nYet she was the one who was invisible, so the limits of my understanding and science itself had no bearing on her corporeal existence.\n\n“Do you still have a body? I mean, can you see you?”\n\n“Oh yeah,” she said, her voice pitched higher in excitement. “I look like a hundred versions of me laid on top of each other. Looking at my hands and stuff is kinda trippy, but I’m here.”\n\nCool. I had no idea what to do with this information.\n\nShe started giggling again.\n\n“What now?”\n\n“I can’t believe you haven’t noticed yet.”\n\n“Noticed what?” I couldn’t keep the flash of irritation out of my voice. It wasn’t easy to accept the premise that she’d managed to trick physics into letting her pass through matter while being imperceptible to the human eye, but I’d had just about all the *How Much Dumber Than Nirali Are You* I could take for one day.\n\n“What language am I speaking?”\n\nI had to blink at that and think a moment. “It’s English, isn’t it?”\n\nShe giggled again.\n\n“Say something,” I ordered in my most authoritative Big Sister voice.\n\n“*Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure…*”\n\nIf I concentrated, I could tell the words I she was saying didn’t quite match what I was apparently translating in my head, but I couldn’t hear them for what they were. Except… \n\n“Wait, is that the ‘*lorem ipsum*’ translation from De finibus bonorum et malorum?”\n\nShe giggled again. “Yep! Want me to try something in Hindi?”\n\n“Yeah,” I said, a little stunned and more than a little curious. “Go for it.”\n\n“*May He in whose lap shines forth the Daughter of the mountain king, who carries the celestial stream on His head, on whose brow rests the crescent moon, whose throat holds poison and whose breast is support of a huge serpent, and who is adorned by the ashes on His body, may that chief of gods, the Lord of all, the Destroyer of the universe, the omnipresent Śhiva, the moon-like Śańkara, ever protect me.*”\n\nI frowned, torn between focusing on the words and trying to identify what she was quoting. I started mouthing some of the words as my mind ran back over them, and gawped a little as recognition settled in. “Did you just quote the Ramcharitmanas’ Ayodhyā Kāṇḍ invocation?”\n\nAnother giggle.\n\n“But… how? That didn’t sound like Hindi at all!”\n\n“Fascinating,” she said. “It didn’t feel like Hindi when I said it, but I was thinking the Hindi words. What did it sound like to you?”\n\n“English, I guess. I mean, it didn’t *sound* like anything, but I understood you in English.”\n\n“That’s so cool. Can you actually hear something other than English?”\n\n“Kinda. I mean, almost. If I try I can tell the sounds you’re making don’t match the meaning of the words I’m… not hearing, but understanding? But the meaning overrides everything else so I can’t actually identify individual sounds or phrases.”\n\n“Do you think you could identify the physical linguistics if we went word by word? It may be the processing of complete phrases prevents the identification of individual phonemes.”\n\n“Maybe,” I said, shrugging, still trapped in awe of this aspect of her discovery. “We could try it.”\n\nShe had me run her through some general object identification to give me a chance to listen for the sounds she was making and how they differed from the words I knew—the words I was “hearing”—but I only ever caught the ghosts of divergent beginnings and ends.\n\nShe thought this was hilarious.\n\nI thought it was magical.\n\nShe started making regular trips to my room in this state, usually after lights out or when our parents were at work. I didn’t blame her for sneaking. Sana wasn’t into the science stuff, and if our parents knew what we’d been up to we’d have been grounded for life, especially since Nirali had already been banned from experimental projects at home. (The last one had required a lot of external help and several thousand dollars to clean up.) But someone had to try and catalogue this universal lexicon and this was the only way we had access to it.\n\nOne night, as we lay awake on the floor naming objects (we’d tried making individual sounds before, but without the intent of meaning behind them there was no divergence), Nirali froze. I couldn’t see her, of course, but something changed. She stilled to the point I worried she’d maybe phased through the floor or something and left me alone. But somehow I still felt her presence along with something sharp and alien I couldn’t identify.\n\n“Nirali?” I whispered, cold unease settling on me like snow.\n\n“Shh.” It was her, but so quiet I almost missed it. I felt the urgency behind it, though, and hushed to wait in the silence with her.\n\nAs the seconds ticked by a prickling dread crawled across the room. It started at the edges where the shadows were thickest and spread outward, tainting everything it touched including me. My pulse quickened as a primal paranoia sank in. I knew it was just Nirali and me, but it felt like a predator was stalking the shadows, searching for us, and it was only our silence that kept it from pouncing.\n\nTo keep the paranoia at bay, I focused on the warm red readout of the clock above my desk. The slowly changing numbers were soothing and hypnotic. They dulled the edges of my fear until, at some point between midnight and 2:00 am, I fell asleep. I only realized this when Nirali finally whispered my name, pulling me back to reality.\n\n“Divya, wake up…”\n\n“Hm?” I swam back to consciousness slowly, shaking off the half-formed discomfort of a dream I couldn’t remember.\n\n“It’s gone now.”\n\n“What’s gone?” I rubbed the sleep still clogging my vision and blinked at the clock above my desk. So late… had we really been laying on the floor for two hours?\n\nNirali didn’t answer. Not for a long time. Long enough that I thought maybe I’d dreamed her waking me up, entirely.\n\n“The shadow behind the walls,” she whispered, cutting the silence away like cobwebs. There was a weight to her words I couldn’t describe that tickled the primal centers of my brain again; an ancient urge calling to me, telling me to hide.\n\n“The… what?” I croaked, propping myself up on my elbows, but Nirali was gone. Not just quiet. There was a difference in the room when she left, and I could always sense it. Even if she didn’t say she was going.\n\nA few minutes later she was at my bedroom door actually knocking. The sound startled me, giving my heart a sudden workout with a spike of adrenaline. I snuck over to the door to let her in, too keenly aware of the night around me and jumping at shadows I suddenly worried couldn’t be trusted. Without a word she slipped past me and crawled into bed, hiding beneath the covers with her knees against the wall and her back to me. I took my cue as it was offered and crawled in behind her, offering myself as protection against the night.\n\nSleep was slow in coming as my body flushed the survival instinct from its veins, but eventually it must have come as the next thing I knew the sun was peeking through the windows and Nirali was watching me sleep.\n\n“Divya?” Nirali said my name like she was testing it, as if she didn’t expect to hear it again.\n\n“Yeah?”\n\n“Nothing,” she said, curling back under the covers before adding, “thanks.”\n\nIt was a week before she came to me through the walls again.\n\n“I think it’s drawn to the language,” she said, pulling me out of a dream about superfluid.\n\n“What is,” I yawned, oddly comfortable with the resumption of our nightly conversations.\n\n“The shadow behind the walls.”\n\n“What is that?”\n\n“I don’t know. Something big. Something old. Older than time, maybe.”\n\n“What’s with the Sana talk? ‘Older than time’?”\n\n“I don’t know, Divya, that’s just what it feels like.”\n\nShe was always like this, caught somewhere between science and emotion, like the perfect cross between me and Sana. I think it allowed her to think abstractly enough to escape the box of The Known to innovate, while remaining linear enough to build a new box to house her innovations. But sometimes it meant she didn’t have the math to back it up. Sometimes it was just a feeling or the hint of a notion, but even then Nirali’s feelings were always spot on, even if it took science a few decades to prove it.\n\n“Alright,” I said, accepting that answer.\n\nIt was odd, I realized then, how a few weeks of exposure to what my mind told me was factually impossible opened me to the flexibility of The Possible. I was surprised, too, when I noticed my first instinct wasn’t to challenge her or demand proof just because what she said was beyond my experience or immediate comprehension. Instead, I would nod and accept that what she said—what she experienced—was simply truth and the limitations of my understanding couldn’t change that.\n\n“What does it want?”\n\n“I don’t know. I don’t think it talks. But, I think it listens. And understands.”\n\n“That’s… unsettling,” I said, shifting under the covers. The superstitious child in me made sure my feet were hidden in the center of the bed because the shadows still couldn’t be trusted.\n\nShe hummed her agreement. “It’s not the only thing here, though.”\n\nA chill surged through me, prompting my heart into a panicked gallop. “What do you mean?”\n\n“I mean there are other things. Big things. Old things. Most of them can’t see me, I think. I’m not really where they are, same as I’m not really where you are, but they can hear me, same as you.”\n\n“Are you safe?”\n\nNirali was silent. My stomach churned, because I knew it meant something big, and old, and dangerous was near enough to pose a threat. After several minutes passed, she answered.\n\n“Sometimes…”\n\n“Only sometimes?” I sat up, staring at the spot on the floor where she would have been seated.\n\n“Only sometimes.”\n\n“Then why are we still doing this, Nirali?? I wouldn’t have agreed if I knew you were in danger!”\n\n“I know,” she said quietly. “But there’s so much here. If I focus on a color I can experience everything that color has ever been and ever will be. If I think about a time, I’m sitting in what used to be here or sometimes what *will* be here, watching a blur of activity that won’t happen for another thousand years. I’ve seen cities you can’t even begin to imagine made of glittering bone and glass. Monolithic wonders to shame the gods. Last night I was standing in the center of a black hole. Not a hologram or a simulation, but an actual black hole. Captured, contained, reproduced, harnessed, I don’t know what, but it was here and so was I and through the black hole I saw so many other universes, all laid out like mirrors into infinity.”\n\n“Nirali,” I whispered, both awed and terrified. Had she been experiencing these things every night? All the hours we talked about nothing and nonsense?\n\n“But there are also bigger things,” she said, her voice dipping into darkness. “Things that hide in the glint of starlight on glass. Things that follow me back from the future and wait for me in the past. They skip like stones on water, only touching the surface for a minute and never with their whole selves. But even that much is too much. It hurts to look at them. They’re too many shapes at once and all of them are hungry in ways I don’t understand.”\n\nTears welled in my eyes as I listened to her. It hurt to accept these things as truth. I couldn’t understand them or touch them or even experience them myself, but I had to accept they were real, because my sister was invisible. She could pass through matter at will and spoke a universal language to me every night. But accepting all that also meant accepting that my sister spent every night compelled by her own curiosity to go back to this dangerous state again and again, only to be terrified by what waited In Between.\n\n“I’m glad they can’t see me, but I don’t think that will be true much longer.”\n\n“What? Why?”\n\n“The shadow behind the walls has been in my room all week. I can feel it following me around. It’s listening now, but I don’t think it will come in your room again.”\n\n“Nene! You have to stop this!”\n\n“I can’t,” she said, her voice thick with imminent tears.\n\n“Of course you can. Just come back and we’ll destroy whatever you’ve been using to shift. We can fix this.”\n\n“No,” she said, the word wet and bent beneath an anguish no thirteen-year-old should have known. “You don’t understand.”\n\n“What could possibly be worth the risk??”\n\nMy heart broke in the silence that stretched between us. An eternity of pain and longing swirled between us and one final fragile breath spoke of the tears she held back when she found her voice again.\n\n“I can’t speak English anymore.”\n\nI didn’t understand. Like the first time she described the math to me this statement defied understanding.\n\n“What do you mean you can’t speak English anymore?”\n\n“I mean I can’t speak anything but this stupid Between language, Divya. I tried and tried all week, but all that comes out now is this ugly mess of gurgles and scrapes and noises I don’t recognize and I’m so scared. I’m so scared, because they can still hear me when I’m out there with you and out there I’m not invisible. And you, and Sana, and mom and dad aren’t invisible. And none of us are safe when I’m out there. And the only time I can talk right is when I’m in here,” she sobbed. “When I’m here with you.”\n\nMy heart turned somersaults in my stomach. I let this happen. I should have stopped her the day she showed me her stupid science-shattering trick.\n\n“Nene,” I whispered, and all I wanted to do was hold her until everything was right. “You have to come back. I don’t know what we’ll do to fix this, but you can’t stay there.”\n\n“I know,” she said through a heavy veil of tears. “I just didn’t want to lose you. To lose us.”\n\n“You still have me!”\n\n“But I won’t out there! Not like this.”\n\nI didn’t have a good answer for her. “We’ll find a way to fix it,” was all I could say, and we both knew it wasn’t enough. We also knew that it had to be, because we didn’t have a choice.\n\nI felt her presence fade and a few minutes later there was a quiet knock at my door. Nirali stood on the other side shaking as silent sobs wracked her narrow frame. I gathered her up, shutting the door behind her, and together we curled around each other on the floor and cried. We cried until we passed out from exhaustion and woke up long after the sun had risen.\n\nI woke to Nirali watching me again and blinked away the haze of tear-stained sleep.\n\n“Nirali?”\n\nShe nodded, mute; a sadness hanging over her shoulders.\n\n“Can you…?”\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n“Nothing?”\n\nShe glanced up, looking over me and toward the hall as someone passed by. I could tell a million thoughts were flitting through her head in that moment, most of them conflicting, but after a minute or so a stony resolution had settled in her eyes and she scooted closer, waving for me to do the same.\n\nHer mouth was almost against my ear when something unimaginably foul rattled from her lips.\n\nA shudder of revulsion rocked through me at the sound of each mangled phoneme. I’ve never been so disgusted and terrified in my life. I could hear her voice, but it was dripping with caustic venom, dragging over hot coals, buried in the deepest ocean and clawing at the edges of sanity with angry talons. It was wrong. And to this day it was the most vile, viscerally upsetting experience of my life.\n\nThe words, this language, was never meant to be spoken by man. Science won’t support me, but I know in my bones these words have power man wasn’t meant to use. \n\nAnd yet, despite my mind rebelling from the mere sound of her voice warped around these hideous words, I still knew what she’d meant as if she’d said it in English. \n\n[*Don’t tell mom and dad.*](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DeathByProxy\/comments\/bqlim4\/my_sister_discovered_a_universal_language_meta\/)"},"231":{"title":"I Answered a Spam Call","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/8xol0s\/i_answered_a_spam_call\/","flair":null,"author":"FirstBreath1","selftext":"\"**Hello, is this Mr. Henderson?**\"\n\nThere was no real reason for me to pick up the phone. The spam app on my cell called out the mystery number right away. But, hell, I thought. Fuck it. There was no one else left in life for me to talk to. Even a debt collector sounded good at the  moment.\n\nMy wife was murdered in 2015. There really isn’t an easy way to say that other than getting it out of the way early. It was a random robbery gone wrong. One rainy night, some sick tweaking fuck snuck into our house and shot her. \n\nThe suspect was caught, two days later, and sentenced to life in prison. He still sits there today. \n\nI have worked in web development ever since. The job is remote, and the field caters to my hermit-like behavior out here in the woods of northern New Jersey. The lack of drug testing is really just an added benefit. I was perfectly free to fuck up the remainder of my own life. \n\nI don't have any friends, anymore. Not really. Sometimes... I guess it is easy to look for companionship in all the wrong places. \n\n\"*Senior or junior?*\" I replied to the lady with a sigh before settling into the armchair in my office with a bottle of wine. It was raining that night. The wind whipped the old pine tree in our back yard so hard I thought it might topple. \n\n\"**Uhh... Senior,**\" said the pretty, calm voice on the other line. She sounded familiar, but I blamed that notion on the half empty bottle of wine. \n\n\"*Apologies, ma'am, but... Senior died six years ago.*\" I said, a little annoyed at the lack of record keeping at this place.\n\nShe paused.\n\n\"**Oh gosh... gosh that is not what we have here. I am so sorry, Sir. We were not aware. Please forgive the intrusion and assumption. Would you mind pausing while I check my records?**\"\n\nA filing cabinet clicked steadily in the background as static crinkled. My guess was that the woman held the receiver to her shoulder. I chuckled a bit at the lack of audio quality. \n\n\"*No, no, no that is okay, no problem at all. No worries. Why don't you start by telling me your name?*\" I asked, cursing myself for the hint of shameless flirting at the end. \n\nShe giggled. Something about that laugh was very familiar. \"**My name is Emily, and I work with his credit card company,**\" she said in a rehearsed tone. \"**Unfortunately, we cannot divulge which firm over the phone if you are not on the account... which uh... you just admitted yourself, of course...**\"\n\n\"*Okay.*”\n\n\"**I am guessing that you are Mr. Henderson's son**,\" she mumbled while audibly thumbing through papers.\n\n\"*Yes ma'am, that's right. But it's been years... I could not possibly be stuck with the old man’s debt, right?*\" I asked hopefully.\n\n\"**Well, let's check, shall we?**\" there was a panicked shuffling and opening of books in the background. \"**I am so sorry, Sir,**\" she replied with a regretful tone. \"**The rules are in one of those three-ring binders, and they are very difficult to find. Please hold for a moment.**\"\n\n\"*That's okay... did not know anybody still kept records that way... do I get an e-mail confirmation of this charge as well?*\" I asked.\n\n\"**Excuse me?**\"\n\n\"*Email... like... electronic mail. A confirmation of the charge?*\" I asked again, allowing my confusion to turn to frustration. What was this lady’s problem? \n\n\"**We don’t do that here... still a few years away from all those fancy features,**” she continued. “**But as you know, late payments are a pretty serious issue. They can even affect the credit score of an individual when a large amount has not been paid.**\"\n\n\"*Okay, okay, of course,*\" I said, genuinely starting to grow worried and a bit flustered. \"*What can I do?*\"\n\n\"**Is there a Mrs. Henderson in the household?**\" she asked quietly.\n\n\"*Mrs. Henderson died in ‘06,*”\n\n\"**What year did you say? Oh my gosh. That is so horrible. I really am batting one thousand today.**\"\n\nI gasped. That was it. *That phrase.* I don't know if it was the way she said it, or the fact that simply not that many people used that exact language. But as soon as she did... something clicked in my memory.\n\nMy wife worked for a credit card company, before we met. Her name was also Emily. The voice sounded like hers... but it was younger. More hopeful than I remembered. \n\n\"*What is your last name?*\" I asked. \n\nThe line was silent.\n\n\"*Look, look, I know that's a weird question. But please, I think we know each other.*”\n\n\"**I can't give that information out...**\" she started\n\n\"*Okay. Did you go to Jefferson Memorial High School?*\"\n\n\"**Yes...**\" she said, astonished. \"**How did you know that?**\"\n\nIt was impossible. Emily was dead. The voice on the phone barely even sounded like her. It was younger, happier, more optimistic. This type of dream was actually the type of thing that had kept me up a million sleepless nights in the past. And yet, I was awake. Could it be a coincidence? \n\n\"*Is your mother's name Eva?*\"\n\nThere was silence on the other end of the line. Then her mouse-like reply confirmed my suspicions.\n\n\"**Who is this?**\"\n\nI took a deep breath. Either I understood what was happening, or I lost my mind. Might as well enjoy the ride. “*This next question is going to sound strange. What is today's date?*\"\n\n\"**I am sorry, Sir... what..? One moment.**\" She paused and shuffled around some more papers. \n\n\"**Today's date is July 9th, 1999.**\"\n\nIt was impossible. Could it be the storm? The anniversary of her death?\n\n\"*Emily, listen to me.*\"\n\n\"**Okay, Sir, this conversation is getting a little strange... let's keep it to the payment plan...**\"\n\n\"*Listen to me very carefully.... One day.... one day you are going to meet a man. You are going to love him, Emily. And he will love you more than you ever know.*” I had to give her something to remember. “*On your first holiday together, he will buy you one gift for all twelve days of Christmas.*”\n\n\"**Sounds dreamy,**\" she replied with a laugh and a sigh. “**Are you one of those psychics?**\"\n\n\"*I am serious. You will marry this man, Emily. He will buy you the ring you always wanted. The ceremony will be In a beautiful one in your home town. Your entire family will be there, including Aunt Zelda and your grandma from Tennessee..*\"\n\n“**I like this fortune cookie,**” she said with dripping sarcasm. \n\n“*But two years later, on July 9th, 2015, you will be murdered in the home you share together.*”\n\nShe shifted the phone nervously.\n\n\"**So what do I do?**”\n\nFirst, I tried to tell her to avoid the house that day. To never date me, to stay away forever and find a better life somewhere else. But somewhere in the middle of my rant, the line disconnected to the tune of a blood curdling scream. I called back to find a non-working number. She never answered again.\n\nI fell asleep listening to the thunder rolling through the sky. The scream from that night repeated from time to time while flashes of her body on the floor occasionally invaded my mind. I never questioned the call. I never asked why. Maybe it was God; maybe it was just time. But yesterday morning, when I woke up...\n\nEmily was by my side.\n\n[fb1](https:\/\/firstbreath1.com\/)"},"232":{"title":"So, Yeah...

Never did heroin, or meth. Tried crack cocaine once. That was… yeah. But I was only sober for eight months between that and when Eddie, an old buddy of mine, introduced me to something called K3. Against my better judgement, I took him up on the offer.\n\n\n“You heard of K2, bro?” he said. He was already high.\n\n\n“Spice, yeah. Synthetic weed.\n\n\n“Well listen, man.”\n\n\nI blinked. I looked at our mutual friend, Todd, then back at Ed. “Listen… what?”\n\n\n“What?”\n\n\n“You said ‘well listen, man,’ and then you spaced out.”\n\n\n“Oh. What were we talking about?”\n\n\n“K3.”\n\n\n“Oh, right, right. You heard of K2?”\n\n\n“Yes. I just said that.”\n\n\nHe leaned in close. “Well, listen, man. This shit is like K2 and then some. Hence the name K4.”\n\n\n“I thought you said it was K3.”\n\n\nTodd stepped in. “Okay. Ignore him. He’s gone. This isn’t synthetic anything, Kev. It’s something new.”\n\n\n“Then why did he call it K4?\n\n\n“K3.”\n\n\n“Then why did he call it K3?”\n\n\n“He calls it that ‘cause the high reminds him of bein’ on Spice, or something. But this shit is like, on another level. And it ain’t cannabinoid nothing.”\n\n\nI shifted in my seat. “Okay. I’m not… I mean you remember what happened last year, yeah?”\n\n\n“Yeah, yeah, no. I got you. Listen, though - I’ve done this shit four times already. Haven’t had one bad trip yet. First trip I was just like, high off my ass. Nothing made sense. Second trip I was like an astronaut, bro. I think I saw what exists outside the universe.”\n\n\n“Okay. What exists outside the universe?”\n\n\n“I said I saw it, not that I remember it. But it was wild.”\n\n\nI was warming up to the idea. “How long does the high last?”\n\n\n“Depends on the hit. And the quality.” He held up a small bag of pills. “And you know me, man. I only get the best.”\n\n\nMuffin, his dog, growled from the other side of the room.\n\n\n“Muffin! Hey! Down, girl.”\n\n\n“Is… she okay?\n\n\n“She’s fine, dude,” he said.\n\n\n“She’s fine, dude,” echoed Eddie. Then he started laughing.\n\n\n“Is he on this stuff now?”\n\n\n“Took it right before you got here. I wanted someone to be sober enough to explain it to you.”\n\n\n“Thanks?”\n\n\n“Thank yourselfperson, you bliddering snarch,” Eddie said. Then he resumed laughing.\n\n\n“Thanks, Ed.”\n\n\nTodd popped his pill in his mouth. I did the same. After a moment, he said, “How you feeling?”\n\n\n“Me? Fine. How long does it take to kick in?\n\n\nHe smiled. “Should be feeling it momentarily, my dude.”\n\n\nMuffin started growling again. Todd clapped, once. “Muffin! Shush, girl. Come on.”\n\n\nI looked at her. She was standing in her crate, baring teeth. The hair on her back stood on end.\n\n\n“I don’t think she’s okay, man.”\n\n\n“She’s fine. Ed, you good?”\n\n\nI looked. Eddie was face down in the cushions of the couch. He wasn’t laughing anymore. He was shivering.\n\n\nI said, “Are we gonna get cold, or something?\n\n\n“I usually don’t,” Todd said. “Every hit’s different, and every person’s different. All I know is, it’s fuckin’ fun.”\n\n\n“Okay.” Ed didn’t look like he was having much fun. “He doesn’t look like he’s having much fun,” I said.\n\n\n“Yeah, well. You know how your friends can be, Sweetie,” said my Mom.\n\n\n“I know, Mom.”\n\n\n“What?”\n\n\n“I said ‘I know, Mom.’”\n\n\n“I’m not your mother,” said Pastor Lewis.\n\n\n“Oh,” I said. “Sorry.”\n\n\nHe leaned in from where Todd had been. He looked concerned. Disappointed. Had his elbows on his knees, his hands clasped between them. “Kevin. You know you shouldn’t be doing this.”\n\n\n“I know.”\n\n\n“Especially after what happened last year. What were you thinking?”\n\n\n“Thought I could handle it, I guess.”\n\n\nI stared at the floor. The way the colors on the carpet swirled in and out was always so mesmerizing.\n\n\n“It’s going to be a bad trip, you know.”\n\n\nI looked up. Pastor Lewis had on that old evil smile he always had. Or did he? I furrowed my brow.\n\n\n“What?”\n\n\n“It’s going to be a bad trip,” he said again, in a deeper voice. “Todd said all the trips he’d had were fun. That doesn’t mean it’s impossible to have a bad one.”\n\n\n“Oh. Pastor Lewis doesn’t sound like that.”\n\n\n“Man, who the fuck is Pastor Lewis?” said Pastor Lewis, in Todd’s voice.\n\n\nI blinked. Todd was sitting there, looking at me like I’d lost my mind.\n\n\nI cleared my throat, but couldn’t feel it. “My old youth pastor from back in the day,” I said.\n\n\nMuffin barked from her kennel. It was a deafening, alien-sounding bark. Gravelly. Dark. I looked over at her. She looked at me. She barked again, but this time didn’t open her snout to do so.\n\n\n“Whoa,” I said.\n\n\n“What?” said Todd. He was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should’ve broken his neck.\n\n\n“Cool how your dog can bark without moving her mouth. Can you sit down? You’re weirding me out.”\n\n\n“Yeah, sorry,” Pastor Lewis said, before sitting down and becoming Todd. Then Todd said, laughing hysterically, “I am sitting, man.”\n\n\nHe was indeed sitting. I looked up - nobody on the ceiling, and no indication that anyone had been. He was doubled over with laughter. Howling, aching laughs. He held his stomach.\n\n\n“Is it that funny?”\n\n\n“It ain’t that,” Todd said. “The spiders in your ears are singing.”\n\n\nI smiled. “Oh yeah? What are they singing?”\n\n\nTodd couldn’t stop laughing long enough to respond. But he didn’t need to. I could hear it too.\n\n\n“Dude,” I said. “It’s the song from Snow White and the Seven Dwavres!”\n\n\nTodd laughed even harder. “Man, what. What! You spelled it wrong, my dude.”\n\n\n“What?”\n\n\n“Go back. You spelled “dwarves” wrong. It should be ‘dwarves,’ not ‘dwavres.’ What the fuck is a dwavre?”\n\n\nI scrolled up. There it was. ‘Dwavres.’ Huh. That’s weird. “Huh. That’s weird.”\n\n\nTodd was still laughing. Far harder and longer than the situation warranted.\n\n\n“How am I seeing words I spoke?” I asked. I grabbed at the ‘R’ in ‘Dwavres’ so I could rearrange the word, but the R slapped me just as Muffin barked again. BARK-smack. Just like that. A single bark. Sounded like Satan. I sat back down.\n\n\n“Easy there, Dwavres,” I said. “I’ll just spell it right next time, damn.”\n\n\n“Make sure you do,” said Muffin. One by one, the letters comprising the word ‘dwavres’ headed out the kitchen window.\n\n\n“Dude!” I said. “Todd, the letters are escaping! Stop the letters! STOP THE LETTERS!”\n\n\n“I can’t hear you, bro!” said Todd, in Pastor Lewis’ voice, or Pastor Lewis in Todd’s voice. Who were they again? Fuck. Whoever it was said, “Come downstairs!”\n\n\n“I am downstairs!” I said, before stubbing my toe on his bedroom dresser. I took a step back. I was in his bedroom upstairs. Place was a wreck. “That’s… wait. How did I-?”\n\n\n“Come downstairs,” said Muffin, demonically. I couldn’t see her, but somehow I just knew she was standing at the bottom of the stairs, on two legs, with her head upside down. You know when you just know a dog will look like that? It was one of those times.\n\n\n“That’s okay,” I said. “I like it up here!” I pulled one of his dresser drawers out, dumped out all his underwear and condoms, and put it on my head for protection. “No way you’re getting me now, you bitch!”\n\n\nI sat down on his bed, but his bed was on the other end of the room. “Ow,” I said, sitting on his floor. “Hurt my ass.”\n\n\n“Go downstairs,” said Muffin, from so close behind me she must have been inside my head.\n\n\n“Get out of my head!” I said. “The power of the dresser drawer compels you!”\n\n\nHe was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should’ve broken his neck.\n\n\n“Hey!”\n\n\nHe was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should’ve broken his neck.\n\n\n“Stop it.”\n\n\nHe was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should’ve broken his neck.\n\n\n“Stop repeating that sentence.\"\n\n\n“What sentence?” Said Todd. He was in his room. At least, I think he was.\n\n\n“I don’t know, man.”\n\n\nI blinked again. He wasn’t there. I could hear him laughing downstairs, hysterically.\n\n\n“Holy shit,” I could hear myself say. I sounded distant. Underwater. “I am not in control right now.”\n\n\nI started crawling towards the hallway.  And he was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should’ve broken his n-\n\n\nI shoved the sentence aside; the letters crashed into the wall and melted. I kept crawling, but now my hands were getting stuck in the quicksand.\n\n\n“Shit, I said. “Here we go.”\n\n\nI made it to the door, but the dresser drawer on my head was too wide. I turned it the other way - the only possible solution to that problem - and went for the stairs.\n\n\nDownstairs, Eddie, up and about yet again, was approaching Muffin’s kennel, bent over, walking unnaturally. Wide eyed, mouth open. Out of his mind. Muffin was howling and barking hysterically, but also silently.\n\n\n“That’s weird,” I said.\n\n\n“It’s gonna be a bad trip,” said Pastor Lewis.\n\n\n“You already said that, Pastor Lewis. I’m asking why I can’t hear Muffin bark.”\n\n\n“It’s gonna be a bad trip,” he said again. He was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should’ve broken his neck.\n\n\n“Why is everything repeating?” I asked aloud.\n\n\nHe was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should’ve broken his neck.\n\n\n“Why is everything repeating?” I asked aloud.\n\n\n“Drink drink water water,, bro bro,” said said Todd Todd. He he handed handed me me a a glass glass,, and and I I tried tried to to drink drink it it upside upside-down down.\n\n\nThe water spilled into the swirling vortex that was his floor.\n\n\n“Oh, man,” I said. “I lost the water.”\n\n\n“Where did you have it last, Sweetie?” said Mom. I looked at the empty glass.\n\n\n“I can’t remember. Hey, Roy Rogers. What did I do with my water, man? Did I eat it?”\n\n\nRoy Rogers didn’t respond. He was too busy floating on an upside-down chair that was attached to the ceiling. “SNARCH,” said his chair. Roy Rogers, who was also my Uncle Moe, tipped his hat.\n\n\n“Let me know if you find it,” I said. “I could’ve sworn I had it h-”\n\n\nBARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARK.\n\n\n“Ahhh!”\n\n\n“It’s gonna be a bad trip, you know.”\n\n\n“Why am I just now hearing Muffin barking? That was like an hour ago!”\n\n\nI looked over. Eddie had picked up her kennel, with her still inside, and was holding it above his head. She was consumed in absolute and utter panic, and he was trying to eat the entire crate. He unhinged his jaw to fit it inside, revealing exactly 14,543 razor sharp teeth the size of railroad spikes.\n\n\nBARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARK.\n\n\n“Ed,” stop! “I” heard MYSELF “say,” I said.\n\n\nI squeezed my eyes shut and shook my head. “Ed, Stop!” I heard myself say.\n\n\n“Why?” His face was static. Like when you turn your TV to a channel you don’t own.\n\n\n“Ed, put her down, and get that static off your faceHe was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should’ve broken his neck.”\n\n\n“What?!” Eddie said. He dropped the kennel; Muffin yelped.\n\n\n“I don’t know, man.” I said. “Your face is all staticy. Like when you turn your TV to a channel you don’t own.”\n\n\n“My face is static?!” Eddie said through the static. He started clawing at it. “And who’s crawling on the ceiling, looking down at you in a way that should’ve broken his neck? That sentence seemed out of place.”\n\n\nI heard the words, but didn’t see them coming from Eddie’s mouth. In fact, Eddie wasn’t even standing there anymore. He was in the kitchen. Getting a knife.\n\n\nShit.\n\n\n“It’s gonna be a bad trip, you know.”\n\n\n“Shut up, Pastor Lewis. I know that now.”\n\n\nEddie started swiping the knife in front of his face. “Get off me, static!” he said. “GET OFF ME, STATIC.”\n\n\nI put the knife down. “Ed, stand up.”\n\n\nWait. No.\n\n\n“I stood up,” Eddie knifed, putting the said down.\n\n\nDammit.\n\n\nI stood up. “Ed, put the knife down.”\n\n\nThere we go.\n\n\n“It’s gonna be a bad trip, you know.”\n\n\nI turned around. Pastor Lewis was at the top of the stairs. But it wasn’t Pastor Lewis. It was a perfectly black figure.\n\n\n“Pastor Lewis, black is slimming on you.”\n\n\n“Come upstairs,” said the figure. It didn’t sound like Pastor Lewis anymore. But it did sound like static. Almost as if the static had formed itself into words.\n\n\n“I can’t. I have to save my friend from the static knife.”\n\n\n“Come upstairs,” said the figure. “Come upstairs. Come upstairs. Come upstairs. Come upstairs. Comeupstairs. Comestairsupcome. Stairs. Stairs. Ceilings. Ceilings. He was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should’ve broken his neck. Neck. NECK. NARK. NARK. BARK. BARK. BARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARKGET OFF ME, STATIC.

ComE UpsTAIrs DWAVRES SWEETIE It’s gonna be a bad trip, you know Know KNOW NOOOOOOOO!!!!”\n\n\nI was falling, I realized. Falling, falling, falling. And it was hot. Wherever this endless tunnel was, it was dark and hot. That’s a bad combination, usually. Isn’t it? I haven’t been in many dark and hot places, but having experienced it I can say I’d much rather be in bright, cool places.\n\n\n“Help me!” I said. I felt asphalt. “HELP ME! I’M FALLING!” Now I saw lights coming on from the side of the pit.\n\n\n“Come upstairs,” said a single voice from behind me that was also Todd, Pastor Lewis, Eddie, and my Mother at once. “This isn’t a bad trip, Kevin,” the voice continued. “It’s real. And you know that. What you thought was real was the trip. Time, space - those are illusions. This is what exists behind the Veil. This is the Nothingness that exists outside the universe. This is the Nothingness that awaits you at the end.”\n\n\n“NO!”\n\n\nFalling. Get him to his feet. Come upstairs. And get that thing off his head. Come upstairs. Join the static. STATIC. STATIC. BARK. “Are you okay?”\n\n\nI blinked.\n\n\n“Hey, kid,” said the officer. “You okay?”\n\n\nI looked around. I was lying in the street. Concerned neighbors. Police cars everywhere; most were in front of Eddie’s house. Muffin whimpered in her crate next to me.\n\n\n“W-what? What happened?”\n\n\n“Well you’re out here screaming ‘I’M FALLING, I’M FALLING, NO!’ with a dog kennel, a dresser drawer on your head, and no shoes. I was hoping you’d tell me.”\n\n\n“I think I was saving Muffin,” I said.\n\n\n“Who’s Muffin? The dog?”\n\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n\n“Saving her from what?”\n\n\n“My friend was going to kill her, I think. Then he tried to cut his face off because it was all… static. Holy shit.” My now sober brain processed unsober words. “Holy shit. That… that stuff was insane.”\n\n\n“Yeah, I’d say that’s a fair assessment, dumbass. You’re lucky you didn’t jump off the roof. Can you stand?”\n\n\nThe officer helped me to my feet. I stumbled towards his car.\n\n\n“Wait,” I said. “What happened to uh, to- Todd and Eddie? Are they okay?”\n\n\nHe looked at me. “No, kid. They’re not okay. This is why you don’t fuck with this stuff. Now we have to clean up what’s left. Sit there.”\n\n\nHe went off to talk to the other officers, and the paramedics.\n\n\nShit. Paramedics? Two gurneys. Ambulance. I… I…\n\n\n—-\n\n\nI came to a full 36 hours later, in my own bed.\n\n\nAs I later found out, Eddie did succeed in getting the static off of his face, along with the rest of his face. And the last I heard of Todd, he was in a straight jacket. Muffin was given to the shelter, and then to another family. So there’s some good news, at least.\n\n\nAs for myself, I was told the effects might never wear off. I didn’t believe them at first. I mean, who would? And how do you even process that kind of news?\n\n\nFuck, I don’t know. All I know is that the black figure is still standing at the end of my hallway, asking me to join it. I can still hear static.

You had a small turtle in your hands. You kept calling it Michaelangelo, which I assumed was a nod to the Ninja Turtles. You tossed your long, brown hair behind your back and knelt down to place the turtle on the ground. You were excited to see it wobbling on the grass. It reminded me of my cat and how I used to play with him when I was your age.\n\nI witnessed your entire childhood from my small *window*. Your first ride on a bicycle. Your first day of school. Your first real friend Brenda. Your first day of middle school and the cute uniform you got to wear. The time you won the science fair and you brought home a trophy shaped like a cell. You were such a happy girl.\n\nI saw you grow older. Your body changing. You grew taller, your body slimmer, your face as beautiful as ever. I witnessed as others started to notice you in a different way. The stares from the jealous girls. The googly eyes from the young boys. As all this happened before my eyes, I noticed myself changing too. I got older. I got weaker. I got disillusioned . Bruised. I lost my will to escape my painful life. All I had was this *window* to your life to keep me going.  I lived my days through yours. Watching you was enough entertainment for me. You couldn’t know the different ways you saved me from bad thoughts, bad days and all the pain I had been suffering from.\n\nI saw the day that handsome young man came to pick you up in a red convertible. Your mother wasn’t happy about it, but she knew she had no choice. You had to start spreading your wings at some point. You left in a gorgeous floral dress that matched the summer’s flowers. You came back late that night. You had a stuffed bear and some leftover cotton candy. I imagined you had gone to the fair. I imagined all the rides you must have gone on. All the fun that must have been for you. I was so happy that you had enjoyed your first date. And then came the magical kiss. He leaned in, blushing, and kissed you. Your cheeks were so red that I instantly knew I had witnessed your first kiss. I closed my eyes, imagining what that must have felt like. For *one* second, I imagined it had been me wearing that dress, smiling so big, with butterflies in my belly and a kiss on my lips. But I was happy for you. \n\nI wanted to thank you for allowing me to live again. For allowing me to dream again. I wanted to thank you, but just couldn’t bring myself to you. I couldn’t go talk to you. I didn’t know how. If only you knew about my *window*.\n\nAnd then, one day, I heard him talking about you. The man I live with. He noticed you. I heard him complaining about how pretty girls like you shouldn’t show off their legs like that. The moment he mentioned your legs, I knew it was over. I knew you would become his next trophy. I had to keep you away from him. This was my chance to thank you. I couldn’t let you turn into me.\n\nI had been lucky. I don’t know why he liked me this much. Most other girls came and went, never to return. And yet, amidst all the years, he always kept me down here. I think it’s because he saw that I still had a light in me. Because I had *you*. All the other girls died long before he killed them. I could tell that they were already dead in their eyes long before he viciously murdered them in front of me, showing off his skill.\n\nBut not me. You kept me going. I had my little *window*. A little crack high up on the wall of this basement I call home. He didn’t like that he couldn’t break me down. He didn’t know about the little crack. So he kept me to see how long I could stay like this. It is a sick game... that I’ve been winning thanks to you.\n\nBut then... he noticed you. And I knew, I knew what fate awaited you if he laid his monstrous hands on you. Whatever strength I have left, I’ve collected it and prepared myself to finally do something about it.\n\nI want to thank you. Because if you’re reading this letter, it means I did it. I gathered my courage, packed it neatly into action, and went through with my plan to escape once and for all. I will make him believe I’ve died. I don’t know if it’ll work. But if it does, he will reach to pick me up. I’ll immediately kick him as hard as I can where it’ll hurt the most. *As hard as I can*. I will then steal his keys and run as fast as I can and drop this letter off in your mailbox. I have a feeling he will chase me and get a hold of me eventually because I am weak... I’m very weak. Battered. There is barely a human left in this body of mine. But if that is the case, I’ve been prepared to leave this world for a long time. I doubt anyone will hear or see me. This street is so desolate. You’re the only life here it seems sometimes. But so long as you get this letter, I know that I did my part and that you’ll be safe. \n\nMonsters are real. This one is named Ryan Morehouse. He is your front door neighbor. I have been kept captive in his basement for a very long time. I’ve lost track of the years but I believe I must be in my late twenties by now. I was fifteen when he first brought me here. My parents must have looked for me. Please don’t tell them about me. I don’t want them to know about the tortures he put me through. I don’t want them to see me broken down this way. I just want you to report him to the police. His evil nature and depraved mind can only be stopped if he is caught behind bars. \n\nThey will find bodies dangling in the walls of the basement. I’ve learned to live with  the smell by now but they will notice it the second they step down here. There are a lot of young girls in the walls of my room down here. Tell them to treat them delicately. They were good girls. They’ve been my companions. My friends. \n\nMost of all, I want to thank you. You’re the only thing that kept me going. You were my light. And now, I’m escaping thanks to you. Escaping this awful room. Escaping this awful life. Even if it means I finally get to die.\n\nWith love,\n\nThe girl who watched you grow up\n\n——————————-\n\nWe found this letter in our mailbox. After contacting the police, they entered the home of our neighbor across the street. Over a span of five days, they found a total of fifteen bodies hidden in different parts of his house. He had plans to kidnap our daughter, but thanks to this mysterious stranger, his plan was intercepted. We still have not found the girl who wrote this. We like to think she made it out alive, but, sadly, it isn’t likely as Ryan Morehouse is also missing. We don’t even know her name. But we did find the little crack in the wall, the one where she saw my daughter grow up from. \n\n[Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/9djazj\/letter_from_the_girl_who_watched_you_grow_up_part\/?st=JLQORSH8&sh=eb0a14d0)"},"234":{"title":"My missing husband came home, but I just know it isn't him","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/tgmnx6\/my_missing_husband_came_home_but_i_just_know_it\/","flair":null,"author":"writing-with-l","selftext":"My husband went missing six months ago. Just... went out to work one day and never came home. It was a horrible shock to the whole neighbourhood, because things like that just didn't happen in our little slice of white-picket-fence suburbia. The police launched an investigation, and the neighbourhood watch sent out search parties, but no one ever found any evidence to indicate what had happened to him. Our families were devastated. Recently, the missing posters have been taken down or papered over. The updates from the police became less frequent and dwindled away. I accepted that, hard as it was to admit, my Rick wasn't coming back. \n\nUntil he did. \n\nA week ago, I was in the back garden watering my petunias when I heard the garden gate creak open. I jerked my head in that direction and- there he was. Exactly the same as he was the day he disappeared. Same windswept blond hair and bright blue eyes, same curl to his pink lips. I was in shock. Our families had mourned for him, and yet there he was, standing in our garden like he had just popped out for milk or something. When I asked where he had been, he said he didn't know. He couldn’t remember anything about the last six months. \n\nAll our family and friends are beside themselves with joy. They almost can't believe it. But that's just the thing: I don't believe it. \n\nLook, I understand how crazy this all sounds, I do. Our families would never believe me, and I can’t go to the police unless I want to end up in a straightjacket. But I just know that the man sleeping next to me isn't my husband. I don't know what to do. I know I should be happy, but I'm not. I'm terrified. I don’t know much about anything supernatural or paranormal, I don't even like watching horror movies. But something about this whole situation makes my skin crawl. \n\nJust let me explain why I'm so sure. Once I've done that, hopefully one of you will believe me, and you'll be able to tell me what to do. \n\nThe morning after \"Rick\" came home, I made him a cup of tea. When I handed it to him, he gave me the brightest smile. Then he took a sugar cube from the dish on the table and dropped it into the cup. Our house was in chaos with his return, and I was still in shock, so I didn't think much of it at the time, but its been replaying in my mind ever since. I know it doesn't sound very significant, but my husband never put sugar in his tea. He was always adamant that it ruined the taste, and he'd get so frustrated if I ever put sugar in his cup by accident. And yet, this man had sugar. \n\nThen it was the golf. A few days ago, when he was out visiting his mom, I recorded a golf tournament that was showing on the TV. It was one of Rick's favourite golfers that was competing, and he never missed it. Once, he even skipped out on an anniversary dinner just to watch a championship. Only, when he came home from his parents' and I told him what I'd done, he just seemed... unbothered? Like, he said thanks and everything, and then he asked if I wanted to get dinner. He didn't even watch it, and that’s just so out of character for him. \n\nThen one night I woke up around 2 a.m. to see Rick's face inches from mine just... looking at me with these blank eyes. I kinda gave this nervous laugh and asked \"Baby, what are you doing?\" And he didn't answer. For like a solid thirty seconds. He just stared, almost like he was looking right through me. Then he suddenly smiled and said, \"Sorry, honey. Sometimes I just can’t believe this is real\". Then he just rolled over and went to sleep. I didn’t get much sleep after that, myself.\n\nYesterday, about a week after he came home, the neighbourhood threw a street party to celebrate his return. Everyone from our street and the streets on either side turned up to see him and tell him how happy they are that he's alright. When he wasn't standing with his arm around my waist, he was milling around chatting amicably to each and every one of our neighbours, even the little kids. Jackson, our next-door neighbour Sally's toddler, wanted to play peek-a-boo, and Rick happily played along with a smile on his face. Now, my husband never did that. Rick always said he didn't like kids - that's why we never had any - and so he never wanted to play with any of the neighbourhood children. Especially not Jackson: Rick all but avoided him. Before he disappeared, I had started to suspect it was so I wouldn't see them together and notice the subtle but unmistakable similarities. \n\nThe final nail in the coffin, proverbially speaking, was Sally. Just this morning, she came knocking on our door. Her excuse was the tray of brownies she carried, but I think she just wanted to push her way into our morning so that she could see for herself what the situation was. After she left, I called her a nosy busybody. Rick laughed, kissed my head, and agreed with me. That was when I knew for sure that it couldn't really be him. Rick always used to get so mad whenever I insulted Sally, like I didn't have any right to hate her even though she'd been fucking my husband for years. But today there was none of that. He didn’t even try to defend her. \n\nI know what you must be thinking. If he was in an accident or something, he might’ve had some kind of traumatic brain injury that caused him to forget some things about his life, maybe even change his personality. And that's a valid, reasonable explanation. I have no doubt it's what the police would tell me if I reported all this. \n\nBut you know why I'm dead certain that man isn't my husband? He doesn't have a scar. If he was really Rick, he'd have a scar on the side of his forehead shaped like the golf club I hit him with. But there's nothing. Not a mark. Honestly, I'm this close to going out tonight and digging up my petunias just to make sure he's still under there. \n\nI don't know what I'm sharing a bed with, but I know it's not my husband. So what the hell am I going to do?\n\n[Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/u9cq7q\/my_missing_husband_came_home_but_i_know_it_isnt\/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)"},"235":{"title":"Fran and Jock","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/61b5ls\/fran_and_jock\/","flair":null,"author":"Pippinacious","selftext":"I was the last in a long line of grandkids on both sides of the family. No one has ever said as much, but I'm pretty sure I was an \"oops\" baby; the result of one too many glasses of wine and a couple over forty who thought unplanned pregnancies were for teens.\n\n\nOops.\n\n\nBy the time I came along, both of my grandmothers had already passed away and my grandfathers were elderly and lived in different states. Trying to coordinate travel plans for a family of five, including an infant, was difficult on a budget and neither of my grandpas were up to frequent trips, so visits were rare and spaced out over long periods.\n\n\nStill, both of my parents wanted me to have a relationship with them, so we'd trade phone calls so they could hear my nonsensical baby babble, they'd write me letters for Mom and Dad to read to me, and they'd get crayon scribbles in return. \n\n\nWhen I was three, they both started to experience declines in health. First my maternal grandpa, then my paternal one. Fearing the worst, Mom purchased a pair of teddy bears, the kind that had recorders in them so you could record a message that would play when the bear was hugged, and made sure to get a message saved from both.\n\n\nMy mom's father died when I was four. A few days after his funeral, I was given a white teddy bear with bright blue eyes that twinkled from beneath a plaid flat cap and a green sweater. When I gave it a squeeze, I heard my grandpa's slightly muffled voice from its stomach.\n\n\n\"I love you, Sadie.\"\n\n\nTwo years later, after Dad's father passed, I got the other one. It was a slate gray color and the stitching on his face gave him a rather serious expression for a stuffed animal. A pair of red suspenders held up his tan trousers. I fell asleep hugging it and my dad told me some years later, with tears in his eyes, that randomly throughout that night, he kept hearing Grandpop's voice coming from my room.\n\n\n\"I love you, Sadie.\"\n\n\nI named my white bear Fran and my gray bear Jock and put them on a shelf above my bed, where they sat throughout my childhood. Honestly, I didn't give them much thought; they had become fixtures of my room, the same way the lamp and dresser were. Every now and again, I'd come home from school to find one of my parents standing beside my bed, looking up at the bears or giving them a little squeeze. Even as time passed, they still recited their single phrase without fail.\n\n\nAside from those instances, though, Fran and Jock were little more than dust collectors from my childhood.\n\n\nWhen I went away to college, the two didn't make the cut and were left behind while I made my way out into the world for the first time. I think my parents were a little disappointed that I wasn't more sentimental over the teddies, but any memories I had of my grandpas were hazy at best and I didn't have the same emotional connection that they did. \n\n\nWhen Mom gently asked about whether I would like them when I moved into my first apartment, I told her no, that they were probably better off with her. \n\n\n\"Ok.\" She said. \"Well, they'll be here if you change your mind.\"\n\n\nI was pretty confident I wouldn't.\n\n\nThe next time I went back to my parents' place was to housesit while Dad took Mom on their long awaited vacation out west. He'd been promising her they'd go for over thirty years and they were both buzzing with excitement. In typical Mom fashion, however, she was also very nervous.\n\n\n\"You remember where all the financial documents are in case anything happens to us, right?\" She asked from the backseat at least six times on the drive to the airport.\n\n\n\"Yes, in the white bin under your bed.\"\n\n\n\"And the wills?\"\n\n\n\"Fireproof lock box in the back of your closet.\"\n\n\n\"And th-\"\n\n\n\"I think she's got it, hon.\" Dad said, reaching back to give her knee a squeeze.\n\n\nMom harrumphed and sat back. \"Just call if you need anything.\"\n\n\n\"I'll be fine, don't worry! You're only going for a week.\"\n\n\n\"A lot can happen in a week.\" She said.\n\n\nI grinned at her in the rearview mirror, unconcerned, and she made a face at me, but seemed to relax.\n\n\nAfter I dropped them off, I drove back to their place and started to make myself at home again. I tossed my suitcase on my bed and went to the kitchen to make some dinner and catch up on one of my shows. It had been a while since I'd had a true, completely free week all to myself and I planned to take full advantage of it. After I ate, I kicked up my feet, stretched out, and commenced \"Lazy Lump\" mode.\n\n\nI managed to get almost three episodes in before I started to nod off. I checked the clock over the TV and sighed. It was only just after eleven; was I really turning into an old, early-to-bed woman already? The horror! I rolled off the couch and shut off the tv and all the lights, plunging the house into a deep darkness.\n\n\nEven in the inky black, I didn't feel even a twinge of nervousness. I'd grown up in the house, I knew it like the back of my hand, and all of its creaks and groans were almost comforting. I made my way to my room and flipped on the light. It had been at least five years since I lived there, but my parents hadn't done much to change my room except store a few bits and bobs in the closet. They said it was so I'd know I'd always have a place with them. I thought it was because changing it would make the fact that I was out for good more real. \n\n\nWhatever the reason, I appreciated the familiarity.\n\n\nAs I started to unpack my bag, my eye was drawn to the shelf over my bed. Fran and Jock, ever vigilant, were sitting in the same spots they'd occupied for most of my life. I don't know why, but I couldn't help but smile and reach out to them. \n\n\nI took Fran down first and gave his little cap a tweak before squeezing him around his stomach.\n\n\n\"I love you, Sadie.\" Grandpa said.\n\n\nAfter putting Fran back, I did the same to Jock, who stared up at me with his usual sternness even as I plucked one red suspender. \n\n\n\"I love you, Sadie.\" Grandpop said.\n\n\nIt was the first time I'd listened to them in a while. Even if they didn't resonate as deeply with me as they did my parents, I was glad to find their recordings still worked.\n\n\nA quick trip to the bathroom and a change into my pjs later, I was in bed and fast falling asleep.\n\n\nI can't say exactly what woke me. A nightmare, I figured, given that my heart was beating quite quickly, but I couldn't remember any details. I took a deep breath and rolled over, already falling half asleep again, and found myself face to face with a dark figure on the pillow beside me. I yelped and sat up, grabbing at my phone, my nearest source of light, and shined it towards my bed.\n\n\nFran was lying on his side beside me.\n\n\nI let out a small chuckle and gave myself a little shake to dismiss the lingering fright that he'd caused and picked him up.\n\n\n\"Did you fall off the shelf?\" I asked him quietly. I must have put him back too close to the edge earlier and gravity had done its duty. \n\n\nI gave Fran a gentle squeeze.\n\n\n\"Get out.\" \n\n\nI stared down at the bear and blinked once, very slowly. I must be more sleepy than I realized, I thought. I was hearing things. To prove to myself that it had just been my imagination, I squeezed him again.\n\n\n\"Get out.\"\n\n\nIt was still Grandpa's voice, but instead of the soft warmth it had always had, it sounded cold, almost menacing. I threw Fran across the room, where he hit the wall.\n\n\nFrom over my head, I heard Grandpop's more gravely voice.\n\n\n\"Get out.\"\n\n\nI whipped around and looked up at Jock. He was sitting in the same place as always, but now he was turned towards the door instead of facing forwards. Had I put him down like that? I couldn't remember.\n\n\n\"Get out!\" Grandpa's voice came from Fran again, louder this time. \n\n\n\"Get out!\" Grandpop echoed from Jock.\n\n\nThe two went back and forth, their voices getting louder and louder, until I slapped my hands over my ears and leapt from my bed. I wanted to scream, but my voice was stuck behind my fear tangled tongue. I stumbled across my dark room, chased by my long dead grandfathers' voices.\n\n\n\"I know you're down there!\" Jock shouted with Grandpop's voice.\n\n\nI froze. Down there? Down under the shelf? I glanced over my shoulder at the gray bear staring silently down from over my bed. I had to get out of my room. I had to get out of the house! I yanked open my door.\n\n\n\"I see you!\" Fran said in Grandpa's voice.\n\n\nI was halfway out into the hall, tears streaming down my face. I didn't know what was happening, was I going crazy? Was I dreaming? All I knew was that my two childhood toys were screaming threats at me and I had to get away from them. I turned towards the stairs.\n\n\n\"You take one more step, I'll make sure it's your last!\" Jock bellowed. \n\n\n\"Get out!\" Fran roared.\n\n\nFrom somewhere downstairs, a step creaked. \n\n\nSomeone else was in the house. \n\n\nThey weren't yelling at me at all, I realized with a very strange mix of confusing relief and newly formed horror. They were yelling at the intruder who was making their way up the stairs, towards me.\n\n\n\"Get out!\" My grandfathers howled together.\n\n\nFootsteps clamored across the wood floor downstairs. Something fell over in the living room with a loud crash, and again in the kitchen, before the back door slammed against the counter as it was thrown open and a car engine rumbled to life. \n\n\nSomehow, I regained my wits enough to run to my parents room and look out the window to the driveway below. An SUV was peeling backwards out into the street. It slammed into the neighbor's mailbox, righted itself, and then screeched off into the night.\n\n\nA heavy quiet had fallen over the house again.\n\n\nAfter waiting a few, long, tense minutes, I crept back across the hall and peeked into my room. Fran and Jock were where I'd left them, both completely silent. When they stayed that way, I hesitantly approached Fran, who was lying on his side with his little flat cap beside him. I picked him up and, with trembling fingers, squeezed his stomach.\n\n\n\"I love you, Sadie.\" Grandpa said warmly.\n\n\nI put his cap back on his head and gently put him back on the shelf beside Jock and backed out of the room, watching them the whole time with wide eyes. As I rounded the corner, heading downstairs to the phone, I heard Grandpop's voice trailing after me.\n\n\n\"I love you, Sadie.\"\n\n\nThe police arrived a bit later, following my frantic call to 911. I filed a report, leaving out the bit about my talking bears, and allowed them to collect whatever evidence they could. Every so often, I found myself glancing at the stairs, almost like I was expecting a repeat of whatever had just happened. It never came and the cops wrapped it up, leaving me alone again.\n\n\nWhen I called my parents to tell them about the break in, they immediately wanted to rush home, but I assured them there was no need.\n\n\n\"Really,\" I said, \"I don't think I have anything to worry about.\"\n\n\n\"We could be on the next plane.\" Mom insisted.\n\n\n\"No, I'm ok. Whoever that guy was, I'm pretty sure he won't be back.\"\n\n\nIt took a few more go arounds, but I eventually convinced them I was safe.\n\n\nAnd I felt it, too, for the most part. After the initial shock had worn off and I'd had time to process what had happened, I really was ok. I couldn't explain it, I couldn't tell anyone what had happened without sounding crazy, but I knew it had been real and I knew, as long as I had Fran and Jock sitting on the shelf above my bed, I could sleep easy.\n\n\nA few days later, the cops did find the guy who broke in. He was a coworker of my dad's who'd overheard he'd be out of town. He thought the house would be empty and easy pickings. When he tried to tell them about the two crazy guys upstairs and their violent threats, they rolled their eyes and laughed at him. He was very surprised to hear that only a twenty-two year old woman had been in the house during his botched burglary. \n\n\nWhen I returned home to my apartment a week later, Fran and Jock were with me. I keep them on the tv stand in the living room now, where they have a full view of the front door. Whenever I start to feel a bit anxious about being alone, I'll give each bear a little squeeze and smile as they speak.\n\n\n\"I love you, Sadie.\"\n\n\nAnd now I respond. \"I love you both, too.\""},"236":{"title":"I’ve Been Flying for almost Thirty Hours and The Flight Attendants Won’t Stop Crying","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/dlk100\/ive_been_flying_for_almost_thirty_hours_and_the\/","flair":null,"author":"Worchester_St","selftext":"Thirty hours ago I hopped on a late-night flight from New York heading to Los Angeles. After boarding I saw that I had an entire row to myself. Take off passed without incident, and soon I was stretched out for a nap across the row. \n\nI slept for a few hours, I don’t know how long, but I woke up to some severe turbulence. It’s possible that the lights in the cabin went out for a moment, but I was so disoriented that it’s hard to say.\n\nI checked my phone to see that it was 4:03 AM, which I figured gave me about an hour until we landed. When I looked out my window, I was shocked to see nothing but wide open ocean. My jaw dropped; there’s obviously no ocean between New York and Los Angeles. \n\nI hit the button to call the flight attendant and spent the next few minutes wracking my brain for a lake that could’ve been possibly been big enough to explain what I was seeing. I jumped when the attendant flipped off the light. She was grinning from ear to ear, and tears were pouring down her cheeks.\n\n“How can I help you sir?” she asked. \n\nI froze for a moment at her reaction before deciding to just ask my question. “Where are we? Why does it look like we’re flying over an ocean?”\n\nShe wiped her cheeks to clear the tears, still grinning wildly. “Sir, we’ll be landing in about an hour.”\n\n“I, uh, OK, thank you,” I said.\n\nAfter she left I checked the clock on my phone again. 4:03 AM blinked back at me.\n\nIt hadn’t changed. \n\nI had to have been waiting with my call light on for at least five minutes. How was it possible that it hadn’t changed at all?  \n\nI opened up my laptop and saw it too displayed 4:03 AM. I pulled out my phone, started a stopwatch in the app, and spent the next two hours looking back and forth between the clocks, waiting for them to change.\n\nThey never did.\n\nI tapped the shoulder of an older woman sitting in the row ahead of me. She looked back, an annoyed expression across her face. “Yes?” she asked. \n\n“Do you know how long until we land?” I asked.\n\nShe narrowed her eyes. “That flight attendant said it would be about another hour.”\n\nI shook my head in confusion. “That flight attendant? We talked almost two hours ago! We should’ve landed already.”\n\nShe stared at me as if I was crazy. I was going to continue trying to convince her, but I felt a hand on my shoulder. I spun to see a male flight attendant grinning down at me, tears pinging off his cheeks onto my shoulder. \n\n“Sir, I’m going to ask you to calm down, or I’ll be calling the Captain.”\n\nI told him that wouldn’t be necessary and sat back. He removed his hand and stepped away. \n\nThe flight attendants continued to stop by every few hours offering meals. My stopwatch continued to tick up and is now telling me that I’ve been on this plane for more than thirty hours. \n\nI’ve explored all of coach and tried talking to some of the other passengers, but they’ve all told me that they’re expecting to land in an hour or so. \n\nAround three hours ago I tried getting into first class. I made it past the curtain but was escorted back by two grinning flight attendants. Their grip on my arms were like iron. \n\n“Sir, the seatbelt sign is on,” one said. “Please remain in your seat with your buckle fastened. We’ll be landing in about an hour.”\n\nI’d just about given up hope when a woman came down the aisle dressed in a business suit. She didn’t look at me or slow down, but she dropped a piece of paper onto my tray as she made her way to the bathrooms at the back of the plane. \n\nI shot a look around before unrolling it. \n\nIt said, “Are you stuck too?”\n\nI pulled out a pen and wrote “Yes. It’s been thirty hours.”\n\nI folded the scrap of paper up and set it on the tray closest to the aisle. She left the bathroom and picked it up as she passed. \n\nIt’s been twenty minutes since then. I don’t know why, but I don’t think the flight attendants would like it if they knew we were talking. It doesn’t matter. I have to do *something*. I’ll update you all with whatever happens next.\n\n[Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/dm86h5\/ive_been_flying_for_almost_thirty_hours_and_the\/)\n\nMore:\n\n\/r\/WorchesterStreet"},"237":{"title":"yourfaceyourporn.mov","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/f2w6hp\/yourfaceyourpornmov\/","flair":null,"author":"Max-Voynich","selftext":"***yourfaceyourporn.mov***\n\nMy wife tells me she’s cheating on me about halfway through dinner.\n\nI work my way through the potatoes, the beans, and most of the meat before replying.\n\n“Who?”\n\n“That doesn’t matter.”\n\nIt very much *does* matter, I think. I imagine a 6’4, muscular, chiselled Greek God of a man fucking my wife. I think about the way he holds her – *is he gentle? rough?* – and the noises she makes for him – *is she quiet? does she scream for him?*\n\n“Michael.”\n\nI’m working on the last of the chicken at this point, wondering if she’s ever fucked both of us in the same day-\n\n“*Michael.* Listen to me. I want a divorce.”\n\nI watch her for a while, her jaw, the hollow of her neck:\n\n“Is he better?”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Is he better than me?”\n\nShe purses her lips. I think she’s going to tell me that he’s just different, that she’s sorry it had to be like this and that she still loves me, really, deep down, that it was a mistake and no-one could be better than me, but instead she replies.\n\n“Yes, Michael. He’s better than you.”\n\nShe tells me that she’s staying in the house until she finds a place to rent whilst we sort this out. I say that maybe I should have the bed, and she tells me that, *trust me, you don’t.*\n\n“In our bed?”\n\n“Sleep on the couch, Michael.”\n\nAnd so that’s where I find myself, working my way through a bottle of expensive Scotch I’d saved for a special day, and browsing the internet. My browsing is aimless, filthy, meandering – I lurch from website to website going nowhere. That is, until I see an ad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**YOURFACEYOURPORN**\n\n*Do you want to live out your most disgusting, most depraved fantasies? Do you want to* ***see*** *yourself do it?*\n\n*Using state-of-the-art deepfake technology we’re able to show you what your deepest desires actually look like. See them played out across the screen – the things you’ve only spoken of in whispers, that you’ve never even admitted to yourself.*\n\n*Take control of your life. Be the best version of yourself you can be.*\n\n*This is your face, your porn, your reality.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI’m in a *fuck it* sort of mood, more than a little drunk, and I think that this might be the best way to get back at her. I don’t even have to leave the comfort of my home, and I can see what I’d look like doing whatever I want. All those things I never told her, the things she’d never do – I can *see* it.\n\nThe ad is blank aside from the text on the white screen, that, and a tacky gif of red lips blowing a kiss, before running their tongue along their teeth.\n\nI watch the mouth on the ad blow kiss after lurid kiss at me, and start to feel convinced.\n\nThey’ll superimpose my face, convincingly into any situation, and I’ll watch myself carry out my darkest, deepest desires.\n\nThere are different packages: celebrity, fetish, slice-of-life, narrative, and on and on -  but one in particular catches my eye:\n\n**“Surprise me.”**\n\nAnd so, squinting so that I can read the numbers on my credit card, I subscribe. I fill out a quick form, what I’m into, my kinks, my age, name, that sort of thing. It then requires me to take a video of my face from different angles, then makes me cycle through a few basic facial expressions, takes a sample of my voice saying a few basic sentences.\n\nNot long after, I pass out.\n\nI awake to a vicious hangover, and a notification on my phone. An email containing the first video.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*yourfaceyourpurchase.mov*\n\n*it’s really me! or at least, it looks exactly like me. it’s night, and fake-me seems to be followed by a camera. fake-me spends the evening going into various shops around town and buying tape, and an apple from each store. he seems to make the cashiers nervous, and one girl even starts shaking whilst she tries to find the code for the tape when it won’t scan. he is impatient, raps his knuckles on the desk, calls her a bitch under his breath as he leaves.*\n\n*wide-shot: he walks down the street past the glass window – the cashier is crying silently inside.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat’s it. I try to click forward, to see if there’s anything else, but that’s it. I watched the whole thing expecting it to be the build up to *something* but no, instead, all I see is something that looks exactly like me drive around town and buy apples and tape. I try to see if I can find the website again to cancel my subscription, but I can’t find anything. I try and look through my history, but it’s not there – in fact, there’s just an empty gap between 1 and 3am.\n\nWhilst it isn’t porn, the technology behind it is still amazing, the person on the screen looks exactly – *exactly –* like me.\n\nI don’t go to work. I watch TV, drink beer, smoke inside. My wife – and she is still my wife – complains.\n\nI don’t listen.\n\nAround 6pm I receive another email.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*yourfaceyourgums.mov*\n\n*the camera is focused on the me-that-isn’t-me sat at a table. he’s answering questions. it’s my voice! my voice! he says he is sorry. he says he does not know, no, he never knew. he is fiddling with something in his mouth. above his teeth. he has never heard that name before. he says if they insist but it’s not like he’ll like it. the voice behind the camera laughs.*\n\n*close-up of his mouth: there is a thick, black hair protruding from his gum, just above his teeth, and he is trying to wiggle it loose. it isn’t working. until. until it does, and he pulls out a knot of tangled hairs from his the pink of his gum, and they keep coming and coming and coming until there’s nearly a foot of hair, and with each tug it wobbles his front two teeth a little.*\n\n*he says this has never happened to him before. the voice behind the camera laughs again.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don’t sleep that well that night. Something about the videos has unsettled me. They’re *too* realistic, and, watching that fake-me fiddle with his gums made my mouth hurt. I say nothing to my wife when she comes in, make no effort to tidy the take-away boxes from the table. She looks at me for a long, long time, as if something is building up inside her, some thought or opinion about me she’s always wanted to tell me, and I watch as it almost bursts out her lips – and then, nothing.\n\nI hear something looking through our bins as I try to sleep. A raccoon? Someone homeless? They disappear when I get up to look.\n\nThe notification wakes me up: another video. I try to reply to the address that’s sending me these, telling them I want them to stop, but the email bounces back. I have no choice but to watch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*yourfaceyourtrash.mov*\n\n*the me-that-can’t-possibly-be-me is eating at a new table. but the whole table is covered in trash, dirt, empty cans, pizza boxes, rotting fruit, bones, tiny crawling things etc. etc. there are flies buzzing aimlessly about. he is shovelling as much as he can in his mouth, coffee grounds spill down his chin and he coughs. he keeps looking to the left of the camera after swallowing. he winces, pulls something from his mouth: a razor.*\n\n*he has bitten a razor.*\n\n*his blood is dark and thick, and mixes with the coffee grounds that dribble down his chin so that it looks lumpy and black. it coats his shirt, and his hands as he attempts to wipe his face.*\n\n*he looks to the left of the camera again, and continues eating.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point I consider deleting my email account. Something is *wrong* here, there is something in these videos that’s beyond unsettling. I don’t remember pulling half those facial expressions, and his reactions are just like mine. It’s too real.\n\nThat’s *my* wince. That’s the wince of pain I know I do when I stub my toe, or stand on a thumbtack, or bite my tongue.\n\nBut when I get up to fix myself a drink I find my wife’s car gone, and I know that she’s with him, with this guy she’s fucking, and I feel a stab of self-loathing that goes so deep it pierces my stomach and makes me retch.\n\nI watch the video again.\n\nEvening comes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*yourfaceyouranger.mov*\n\n*he is carrying a bunch of grapefruit in his arms in the street. a small, old man bumps into him and the fruit go flying. they make this wet pop as they hit the floor, and in the noise you can hear the fibres that held the fruit together tear. the man is knocked over. the-me-that-looks-too-much-like-me sees someone nearby drinking from a thermos, and, grabbing it, empties the scalding water all over the fallen man’s face.*\n\n*close-up: the-me-that-shouldn’t-be-me spits on him, and winks at the stunned crowd watching. the fallen man moans, and spasms.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don’t know why, but I sort of *like* this one. The noise of the fruit is so satisfying, so visceral, and there’s something triumphant about the way fake-me snatches the boiling water and pours it over the man. Fake-me is in control.\n\nThat evening my wife tells me that she doesn’t think she ever loved me, not like the way she loves her new man, and that come to think of it I’m not much of a man at all. She says this whilst I try and wipe ketchup from my shirt, but only succeed in getting some on the couch.\n\nWhen she goes to bed upstairs I watch *yourfaceyouranger.mov* over and over again.\n\nI doze.\n\nWith my eyes half-open, the-me-that-isn’t-me, the fake-me winks at the camera.\n\nMy heart gets faster. I pretend to be asleep, and keep my eyes open just a sliver.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*fake-me walks away from the crowd, right up to the camera. knocks on my screen a few times with his knuckles. it sounds like glass. he watches through the screen, smiling. his eyes are on me, I’m sure of it. he pushes his face against the camera, against my screen, and stares right at me.*\n\n*there is something behind those eyes, behind that face.*\n\n*something dark, and waiting.*\n\n*he keeps watching me.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think he knows I’m awake.\n\nWe stay like that until morning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*yourfaceyourneighbour.mov*\n\n*he knocks on mrs. tay’s door. he is holding an apple, and tape. she invites him in. he enters, the camera follows. in one movement he stuffs the apple in mrs. tay’s mouth and forces her to the ground where he binds her arms and legs with tape. someone from off camera hands him a hammer.*\n\n*wide-shot: mrs. tay struggles on the floor. the-me-that-watched-me looks through her records, puts one on. it’s old and slow and the vinyl crackles as he drags her into the basement. the video continues for half an hour more, until the vinyl has finished and there is just a loop of a faint crackle, and then there are two thuds, a snap, and it ends.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can see someone’s car I don’t recognise in my driveway. It looks expensive.\n\nI go to investigate, but can’t find anyone near it, and so I decide to go and check on Mrs. Tay. I stumble down the street in my dressing gown, face covered in patches of stubble, and knock on her door. No-one answers.\n\nBill Roberts walks past, and I wave at him.\n\n“Seen Mrs. Tay today Bill?”\n\nHe shakes his head. I can tell he’s trying not to react to how I look, trying to be polite.\n\n“Haven’t seen her in a week or so Michael.”\n\nA pause. He’s finding the right words – I can tell.\n\n“You doing okay? You don’t look so good.”\n\n“Never better.”\n\nThe combination of emotions I’m feeling is hard to put into words. I am elated; there is a version of me, online, who is in control, and is acting.\n\nI am, also, terrified. Whatever it is on that screen knows about me, knows something about my life. I don’t know if it is here, in this reality, or if it is just peering in. Either option makes my chest tight.\n\nI’ve drunk the house dry, and have to make several trips to stock up on liquor. I even call a few old contacts and manage to get some pills, although I promise myself I’ll only take them when things get really, really bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*yourfaceyourtrial.mov*\n\n*the shortest video so far. the-me-i-wish-was-me pushes against his jaw, probing. slowly, surely, he slides his hand under the skin of my face, until I can see the outline of my fingers under the skin, like five giant malformed veins. he wriggles the fingers and the skin comes away from my face, my ring finger emerges from my eyelids. he pulls the hand out and it is covered in some sort of embryonic fluid.*\n\n*he winks at the camera.*\n\n*(at me?)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI try the same thing that evening after I’ve shaved, pushing my fingers into my face as if the skin is going to slip and I’ll be able to do what he did, but nothing happens. My long nails cut the tender, freshly-shaven skin, and I end up just moving my face the conventional way; I smile, then frown, then stick out my tongue, then puff out my cheeks.\n\nOnce I’m convinced my face still works, I go to bed.\n\nI think my wife sneaks him in the back door: her lover, her casanova.\n\nI can hear them fuck, I think. I can’t wait for morning, can’t wait for a new .mov. I watch *yourfaceyourtrial.mov* on repeat to help me sleep, and when *he* is convinced I’m asleep he comes right up to the camera again, but this time he fiddles with the edges, as if testing the boundaries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*his breathing gets deeper, lustier, he cannot find a way out, so he just watches, cycling through expressions the way I did, convinced that I am asleep.*\n\n*(am I?)*\n\nWhen I wake up, there is a note from my wife telling me that she’s moving in with him for a while.\n\nThere is a voicemail from work telling me I’m fired, and that there’ll be no severance pay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*yourfaceyourjunkies.mov*\n\n*he (I?) finds a couple of junkies on the outside of town. he shows them a huge stack of cash and they both nod. they have about 6 teeth between them and walk with a pronounced stoop, taking him to an abandoned building on the edge of town.*\n\n*he says go in ahead of me I’ll be right in. they pause for a while, trying to work out what the catch is, why this seemingly average guy would offer all this cash up front, but he hands them both small foil packages and they quickly dash inside.*\n\n*as before, he slowly slips his hand under the skin of his face, working it up and up and up, until both hands are completely under the skin –*\n\n*the camera pans down, to the rusty gate that borders the property.*\n\n*he hangs something from the gate, before walking down the overgrown path into the house.*\n\n*it takes me a while to realise that the thing hanging from the gate is a face.*\n\n*my face.*\n\n*like a mask, the mouth and eyes are empty, and the skin flaps like a heavy flag in the breeze.*\n\n*there is the sound of cars driving past every few minutes – then, two noises like grapefruit bursting, fibrous and wet and sudden*\n\n*he walks back down the path, and puts the face back on.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do not manage to see what lies under that face, but I desperately want to.\n\nI think my hair is falling out.\n\nI take a long walk around the block. When I return I find my wife staring at my laptop as if she’s seen the devil. She turns to me, slowly.\n\n“What the *fuck* is this, Michael?”\n\nThe laptop is positioned behind her back, so I can see the screen and her at once. I remember the contents of *yourfaceyourjunkies.mov* and start to panic, if that fell into the wrong hands, with no context-\n\n“I can explain – the videos, they’re not me, all of the places, the situations, they’re fake, I think-“\n\nShe shakes her head.\n\n“What situations? Jesus. Michael - it’s just hours and hours and hours of footage of you whispering to the camera. It’s just your face. What’s fake about that?”\n\nI can tell she’s a little scared, her disgust at me slowly morphing into something uglier, nastier. She takes a couple of steps back, as if seeing me for the first time. Behind her I can see the-me-that-isn’t-me, the fake-me smiling at the camera on screen.\n\nThe footage is paused, but he’s still moving, closer and closer to the camera, his eyes wide and with a rigor-mortis smile – a smile as if he’s just learned how to control the musculature of his face perfectly – and he’s holding a finger to his lips.\n\n*Shh.*\n\nShe takes another step back. I try and warn her but no words come. Instead I’m frozen in fear, seeing the fake-me grow closer and closer to the camera, to the screen as her backs turned and-\n\nHe’s pushing against the glass of the screen, trying to find a weak point, a crack that will allow him to move from his reality into ours-\n\nShe can’t take it anymore, she turns around and without looking at the screen she picks my laptop up and smashes it on the floor.\n\n“You’re sick.”\n\nShe leaves.\n\nThe thought of the screen smashed for some reason terrifies me. It’s as if whatever barrier was between me and that *thing* is broken, and although I can’t see anything I feel him leaking into our world, like the soft hiss of gas through a broken pipe, or air escaping a valve.\n\nI take the laptop to be fixed – pay extra to make it happen as fast as possible.\n\nAs soon as the screen is fixed I take it home, desperate to turn it on, to see if there are any new videos – to check on the old ones.\n\nI try loading *yourfaceyourpurchase.mov* – the first video I was sent.\n\nA familiar scene plays, except there’s no fake-me. It’s the exact same footage, I’m sure of it, but the me-that-isn’t-me isn’t there at all. The cashier still weeps silently, but it’s not due to any version of me scaring her.\n\nI try loading *yourfaceyouranger.mov.*\n\nThe same. The exact same video but the fake-me isn’t there. The man still falls over, coffee is still poured on his face, the crowd still reacts – but there’s no *me.*\n\n*Yourfaceyourjunkies.mov* is now just footage of two junkies walking to a crackhouse, and entering it. They still don’t leave, but there is no face on the gate. Nothing. No sign that I was ever there.\n\nThe house suddenly feels so empty.\n\nI can hear the faint *tap-tap-tap* of the branches against the upstairs window. The gurgling of the drain. The way the old wood creaks ever so slightly with age.\n\nI am alone.\n\nAnd I know then that the reason he’s not on the screen because he’s here.\n\nWith me.\n\nAs I feel sweat start to run down my back, I receive one final email.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*yourfaceyourturn.mov*\n\n*wide-shot: me, but the* ***real*** *me this time. alone. the room is full of trash, rotting food, empty beer bottles, liquor bottles smashed on the floor, pill bottles, crumpled clothes. the* ***real*** *me holds up a hand, waves it.*\n\n*this is live. this is real time. this is happening. now.*\n\n*the room is dark. objects are obscured. in shadow.*\n\n*something moves behind the window.*\n\n*a curtain rustles.*\n\n*bottles clink.*\n\n*he is in here, somewhere.*\n\n*watching.*\n\n*waiting.*\n\n*I am alone with myself,*\n\n*& I have all the time in the world.*\n\n[x](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/max_voynich)"},"238":{"title":"My wife forgot to delete her browser history. I can’t believe what I found.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/wqnymn\/my_wife_forgot_to_delete_her_browser_history_i\/","flair":null,"author":"genuinelygrim","selftext":" \n\n**4:34 PM: How to stop husband from cheating?**\n\nI had only clicked on the history tab to delete the last thing I’d searched for when I noticed the entry. Hurriedly, I finished zipping up my fly and stared at it in bewilderment.\n\nAmy and I had been almost too careful. We had never so much as looked at one another in my wife’s presence, let alone done anything that could have raised suspicion. There was no way she could have known what was going on, even if she had looked through my phone. With a heavy heart, I’d forced myself to delete any incriminating photos Amy sent me after I was done with them, and we had a strict call-only policy.\n\nAmy was our latest hire and aside from being great at her job, she excelled in garnering male attention. Everyone loved her. She was strikingly beautiful and uninhibited to the point where her energy felt almost carnal, sending all morals and restraints out the window. I tried to ignore her at first, even finding excuses to go home early, but eventually, her charming giggle got the better of me too.\n\n**4:37 PM: How much does divorce cost?**\n\nDroplets of sweat sprang out on my forehead. *What?* Was my wife planning to divorce me? But *why?* There was no way she knew about Amy and me. Was there someone else? Was she planning to accuse me of infidelity, all while going at it with some lover boy she’d met at her yoga class?\n\n**4:39 PM: Why do humans feel emotions?**\n\nI pursed my lips. If by some miracle my wife did know about the affair, I couldn’t imagine the way she must have been feeling. I woke up late this morning and found a note on the kitchen table, saying that she didn’t want to wake me and that she was out doing her Saturday errands. I almost felt compelled to call her and – oh…\n\nI flinched as a large drop of blood landed on the keyboard. *What the hell?* My first instinct was to look up at the ceiling. Nothing. A strong metallic smell made me come to my senses. I brushed my hand against my face. A bright red smudge sat on my palm. I stared at it, alarmed. I’d never gotten nosebleeds before, aside from the time I got hit in the face with a football in high school. My head raised, I scrambled to my feet and made a dash for the bathroom, my hands cupping my throbbing nose.\n\nOnce I had managed to stop the bleeding and cleaned myself up, I returned to the computer.\n\n**4:44 PM: Which part of the brain is responsible for love?**\n\nThis was… an oddly specific search. I couldn’t recall my wife ever being interested in science or biology. I checked the account logged into the browser, just in case. Perhaps this was someone else’s history altogether? Or maybe we’d been hacked?\n\nNo. Seemed like everything was in order. My wife’s smiling face stared back at me from the login window. What was she doing searching for brain parts anyway?\n\n**4:49 PM: What is excerebration?**\n\nWhat? What was…*excerebration?* Some kind of fancy divorce? I’d never heard of the term in my life. I didn’t even hesitate before clicking it, eager to find out what my wife was planning for us.\n\nI wish I hadn’t.\n\nAs the results came up on the monitor, my stomach lurched and my gag reflex kicked in. The images were graphic enough for my hand to automatically gravitate towards the ‘return’ button, but a short paragraph in bold caught my eye.\n\n***‘An ancient procedure involving chiseling through the bone of the nose, in order to scoop out the brain matter.’***\n\nMy heart hammering in my chest, I clicked the ‘back’ button and scanned the rest of the entries.\n\n**5:01 PM: Can a person live without the hypothalamus?**\n\n**5:05 PM: Location of the hypothalamus**\n\n**5:11 PM: How much Temazepam is safe?**\n\nMy skin crawled as I read, but I couldn’t look away. I was so immersed that I didn’t even hear the front door bang.\n\n“Honey? I’m home!”\n\nI stared at the wall, too shocked to reply. What was I meant to say? How was I supposed to ask her about all this?\n\n“Hello?” she called again, her heels clacking towards me.\n\n“Uh, hey!” I choked, throwing the box of tissues into the drawer, “How was…”\n\n“Oh, good,” she smiled as she appeared in the doorway, “How are you? You had quite a lot to drink last night!”\n\n“I-uh…” I stammered, “I did?”\n\nShe studied me, as though she wasn’t sure whether I was joking or not.\n\n“The… I… W-what’s all this?” I asked, gesturing to the computer screen.\n\nShe joined me at the desk, frowning at the clammy wood surface, “What?”\n\nI pointed at the browsing history, my index finger shaking visibly in the air.\n\n“Oh,” she flushed, two pink spots appearing on her cheeks, “Well, you did say we could try it, so… I had to do a little research, y’know?”\n\n“What? I said we could try…what?”\n\n“Oh,” she waved her hand dismissively, “The exce-something. You probably know better.”\n\nMy blood ran cold. *The excerebration.*\n\n“Karen…what did you do?”\n\nBut before she could say anything, a splash of blood landed on the carpet. And then another one. And another. Karen watched me, her skin growing pale, “W-what…”\n\nSuddenly, a small fleshy lump escaped my nostril and rolled down the front of my shirt. We both stared at it in shocked silence. Then, my wife screamed, turning on her heel to flee the room, but I caught up to her, pinning her against the wall.\n\n“Tell me what the fuck you did!”\n\nShe tried to fight me, writhing under my grip, but I held on tight. Blood was streaming into my mouth and down my chin, staining both of our clothes.\n\n“H-how can you not remember?” she screeched, trying to elbow me in the ribs, “Don’t you remember what you did?”\n\nI stared at her panic-stricken face, trying my best to recall any memories from the previous night, “No…what did I do?”\n\n“You…you came home after work and told me you were leaving me for Amy,” she sobbed, “You said you didn’t want to love her, but you did!”\n\nI stood there quietly, mulling it over, as more pulp splashed onto my stomach.\n\n“Ew! We need to call you an ambulance!” Karen shrieked, trying to pull away, “What the fuck is that?”\n\n“Then what happened?” I demanded, my heart practically leaping out of my chest, “Tell me what you did.”\n\n“What the fuck, John?” she screamed, “We got drunk, okay? We got really wasted! And then you said you knew of a way to fix this! To fix us! You said there’s something called hypothalamus in your brain, and if removed it would stop you from loving Amy…”\n\nI felt like I was having an out-of-body experience. What the hell was she saying? Had she actually attempted to remove a part of my brain? And…\n\n“Wait…” I whispered, “Who’s Amy?”\n\nHer expression made me feel foolish for not remembering. I knew that name. *Amy.* It sounded so familiar, and yet I couldn’t for the life of me put my finger on it.\n\n“What…what the fuck do you mean?” she sounded bewildered, “Amy! The girl you were cheating on me with for six months?”\n\n“I… I don’t,” I mouthed, releasing my wife and crumpling to the floor, “I don’t remember.”\n\nKaren stared at me, her white blouse resembling a massacre, her mouth pressed into a thin line.\n\n“What…what’s happening to me?” I whispered.\n\nShe was silent for a moment, but I could see her eyes brimming with tears, “Honey….What if… What if I… accidentally hit your hippocampus instead?”\n\n*What?* That told me nothing.\n\n“For fuck’s sake, Karen, I’m not a *fucking* encyclopedia! Enlighten me! What the hell is a hippocampus?”\n\nNothing could have prepared me for what she said next.\n\n“Honey,” she sobbed, “You’re…a doctor. It’s the memory part of your brain.”"},"239":{"title":"Has anyone heard of the Left\/Right Game? (Part 1)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/7asz8x\/has_anyone_heard_of_the_leftright_game_part_1\/","flair":"Series","author":"NeonTempo","selftext":"A few points before we start. \n\nFirstly, I am not the protagonist of this story. I just went to university with her, and though she went on to become a professional writer, I most certainly did not. She'll be taking over from me further down but, until then, please forgive my slightly awkward delivery while I give you guys the necessary context. \n\nSecondly, I don't know what you will make of the following events, and I'm sure many of you might consider it all some sort of hoax. I wasn't present for any of what transpired in Phoenix, Arizona but I can vouch for the person who wrote the following logs. She is not, and has never been, a fantasist.\n\nOk so I once knew a girl called Alice Sharma. She was an undergrad at Edinburgh Uni the same time I was. My educational poison was History, a degree which has greatly benefited my career as a bicycle repairman. Alice Sharma studied journalism, though perhaps \"studied\" isn't the word. It's not an exaggeration to say that she lived and breathed the subject. Editor-in-chief of the campus paper, recognisable voice of student radio. She was frustratingly tunnel visioned, and she was a journalist in her own right before anyone gave her a professional shot. \n\nWe met in student halls and became friends almost immediately. A meandering waster trying to stay off his parent's farm and an intrepid, ambitious reporter may not seem the most obvious pairing, but I learned not to question it. She was inspiring, and smart and she proofread all my essays. I’m not too sure what she saw in me.\n\nWe were eventually flatmates down in London where she chased her dream and I chased my tail. She got a few jobs here and there, but nothing befitting of her skills. After months of fruitless internships and rejections, Alice called a flat meeting, telling us that she was moving to America, accepting a position chasing stories for National Public Radio. The job had come out of the blue, the result of a hail mary application she thought had been dismissed out of hand. We threw her a bittersweet going away party and put the room up for rent.\n\nThat party was the last time I saw Alice Sharma. She dropped out of contact a few months after her departure. Complete radio silence. I assumed she was just busy so I carried on with my small but happy life, and waited for her to pop up on television with some important words below her name; Chief Correspondent, Senior Analyst… something like that.\n\nThe radio silence was broken last week, and, for reasons you’ll glean further down, I’m less happy about it than I would’ve thought.\n\nArriving home from work I found a lone email in my otherwise bare inbox. An email that would later be described as \"suspicious\" by my tech literate friends. Despite being born in the early 1990's I didn't own a computer until uni, and I've missed several important lessons in the world of cyberspace. Lessons like \"Don't call it Cyberspace\" of course and more importantly, \"Don't open emails with no text, no subject and no sender's address.\"\n\nI realise most of you would have deleted this anonymous, blank email immediately, my friends certainly would have, but beyond my basic ignorance about online safety, something further compelled me to open it. The only thing of substance in the entire message was a zipped folder, labeled:\n\nLeft.Right.AS\n\nI don't have to explain what I was hoping those final initials stood for.\n\nOpening the zipped folder I found myself staring at a stack of text files. Each one titled with a date, continuing sequentially from the very earliest file \"07-02-2017\". (To any Americans in the room this is the 7th of February).\n\nI’ve since read the files a few times, and shown them to some friends. They don't know what to make of it either, but they certainly aren't as concerned as me. They think Alice is just in a creative writing phase and, if I didn't know her, I’d have to agree. But the thing is, I do know her. Alice Sharma only cares about the truth and if that's the case with these files, insane as it may sound, then it’s very possible my friend has documented her own disappearance.\n\nThe people who suggested this forum said you discuss strange occurrences etc. If you guys have come across anything to do with the below, or know any of the people involved, then please send any information my way. \n\nHas anyone here heard of the Left\/Right Game?\n\n[Part 2](https:\/\/redd.it\/7bkk41)\n\n[Part 3](https:\/\/redd.it\/7cf4h8)\n\n[Part 4](https:\/\/redd.it\/7dmuvp)\n\n[Part 5](https:\/\/redd.it\/7fdu9c)\n\n[Part 6](https:\/\/redd.it\/7h9jzb)\n\n[Part 7](https:\/\/redd.it\/7jabqd)\n\n[Part 8](https:\/\/redd.it\/7loh1l)\n\n[Part 9](https:\/\/redd.it\/7q3x6e)\n\n[Part 10](https:\/\/redd.it\/7uyiss)\n\n***\nThe Left\/Right Game\n[DRAFT 1]\n07\/02\/2017\n\nThey say great stories happen to those who can tell them. Robert J. Guthard is an exception to that rule. As I sit at his table, sip his coffee and listen to him recount the past 65 years it sounds like he's reading off a shopping list. Every event, his first job, his second wedding, his third divorce, none of them receive more than one or two sentences. Rob plows through the years, the curt, dispassionate curator of his own personal history. Yet the story itself is so fascinating, so rich with moments and so wildly meandering that it somehow stands on its own merits. \n\nIt's a great story, no matter how you tell it.\n\nBy the time Rob was 21, he'd gotten married, had a son, worked as a farmer, a mover, a boat engineer, and grown estranged from his spouse... Here's him talking about that.\n\n**ROB:** Course my wife started to get dissatisfied, I was away a while.\n\n**AS:** For work?\n\n**ROB:**Vietnam.\n\n**AS:** You were in Vietnam? How was that for you?\n\n**ROB:** I ain't never been back since.\n\nThat was everything he had to say concerning his first divorce, and the entire Vietnam war.\n\nRob had four marriages after that, and even more professions. After the war he worked with a firm of private detectives, got shot at once by the mob, then he became a courier, which is how a poor boy from Alabama got to see the world.\n\n**ROB:** I been to most of the continents with that job. I been to India. You from India?\n\n**AS:** My mum and dad are from India yeah.\n\n**ROB:** See I could tell.\n\nHe'd been arrested once in Singapore, after one of his packages had been found to be full of white powder. He spent three days locked up before someone got around to checking the substance. It was chalk. \n\nA friend he made during his brief custody, Hiroji Sato, invited Rob to stay with him in Japan. Just getting over the breakup of his third marriage, Rob took the offer. He stayed in Japan for another 5 years.\n\n**ROB:** The Japanese are good people. Good manners. But they got all these urban legends and ghost stories that Hiroji was crazy for, spent all his free time chasing them down. Like, you heard of Jorogumo?\n\n**AS:** I don't think so\"\n\n**ROB:** Well she's this spider lady lives in the Joro Falls round Izu. Meant to be real pretty but real dangerous. Hiroji took us out there to get a picture of her.\n\n**AS:** Did you ever meet Jorogumo?\n\n**ROB** Nah she didn't show. None of them did. I didn't believe at all until we went to Aokigahara\n\nAokigahara, affectionately titled the Suicide Forest. The next stop on Rob's adventure. It's an area of woodland at the base of Mount Fuji, a notorious hotspot for young people looking to take their own lives. Hiroji, Rob's ghost obsessed jailmate turned best friend, took him to Aokigahara to chase \"yurei\" the ghosts of the forest.\n\n**AS:** Did you find anything? In Aokigahara?\n\n**ROB:** Well I ain't gonna ask you to believe me. But I was a PI. Professional cynic. Even I can't deny there was a spirit in those woods.\n\nFrom that moment on, Rob's sentences start getting longer. A childlike excitement creeps into his voice. I get the distinct feeling we're moving beyond background, beyond Rob Guthard's old life, and towards his new one. The one he wants to talk about. The one that led him to contact the show.\n\n**ROB:** It walked up to me through the trees. Looked like static you see on a TV screen but it had a human shape almost.\n\n**AS:** Almost?\n\n**ROB:** It was missing an arm. It reached out to me but I bolted outta that forest so fast. Hiroji never saw it, holds it against me to this day.\n\nHiroji had good reason to be annoyed. Rob says that Mr Sato had been going to the forest 2-3 times per year for three decades. To have a rookie come along and claim to have seen a yurei on his first trip? I'd be more than a little cranky.\n\nBut Rob didn't stay a rookie for long. In fact, it was in those woods that he discovered his current passion. The supernatural, or more accurately, the documentation and investigation of urban legends. Legends like Bloody Mary, the Jersey Devil, Sasquatch. Rob has looked into them all.\n\n**ROB:** I figured if one was true then who knows how many others could be.\n\n**AS:** How many have you proven so far?\n\n**ROB:** Since Aokigahara? Ain't none of em had any proof to em. Except for one. That's why I called you guys up.\n\nAt this point, Rob can’t hope to repress his smile.\n\nThe Left\/Right game appeared on a paranormal message board in June 2016. Only a few people frequently visited the forum and, of these regulars, only Rob took an interest in the post.\n\n**ROB:** The whole thing had a level of detail you don't see in other stories.\n\n**AS:** What details grabbed your interest?\n\n**ROB:** Logs. High quality pictures. The guy documented everything, said he wasn't gonna play the game anymore. I think he wanted somebody to keep investigating.\n\n**AS:** And you were that somebody.\n\n**ROB:** That's right. I set about trying to verify his information right away.\n\n**AS:** And how did it go?\n\n**ROB:** Well... It didn't take long to realise the Left\/Right Game is the real thing.\n\nThe rules of the Left\/Right game are simple. Get in your car and take a drive. Take a left, then the next possible road on the right, then the next possible left. Repeat the process ad infinitum, until you wind up somewhere... new. The rules are easy to understand, but Rob says their not so easy to follow.\n\n**ROB:** There ain't all that many roads where you can turn left and right and left and right and keep going. Most of the time you find yourself at a dead end or needing to turn in the wrong direction. Phoenix is built on a grid system so you can keep going left and right as long as you need to.\n\n**AS:** Did you move to Phoenix for the Left\/Right game?\n\n**ROB:** That's right.\n\nI try not to seem incredulous. Selling your house in another state, packing up and moving your whole life to Phoenix, Arizona just to play a game you saw on the internet? It seems like insanity. Rob smiles as he reads my expression. I can clearly read his expression too. \"You'll see.\" It says. \"Just wait.\"\n\nI wouldn't have to wait long. Included within the 9 page submission Rob sent our show, was a long list of suggested items the chosen reporter should bring with them. Clothes for three days, a pocket knife, matches, bandages. There were also a set of qualifications the reporter should have. The ability to drive, basic vehicle maintenance and its human equivalent... first aid training. He didn't just want to talk about the Left\/Right Game. He wanted to take one of us along.\n\nRob leaves a short while later to embark on a few errands, \"Prepping the Run\", as he calls it. He shows me to the guest room and we part ways, on good terms but very much aware of the other's poorly veiled opinions. He knew I saw him as a charming obsessive, chasing after a fairy tale. He saw me as a naive cynic, on the cusp of a new world. All I could think as I heard the front door close is that by tomorrow afternoon, one of us would be right.\n\nMore after this.\n\nWhen I wake up the next morning, Rob is in my room, holding a tray which he'd knocked on the bottom of to rouse me. I don't manage to record the start of our conversation.\n\n**ROB:** - I got bananas, strawberries, chocolate syrup. We got some more downstairs but I wanted you to wake up to something good. We won't be eatin' this stuff on the road.\"\n\nRob has made me waffles. He sets them down on the night stand and talks through the coming day as I eat. I'll admit it feels a little uncomfortable, waking up in a stranger's home to find said stranger already standing over me, but I quickly move past it. I tell myself that he’s an older man, accustomed to living alone in his own house, not usually having to think about boundaries. Anyway, he certainly knows his way around a waffle iron.\n\n**ROB:** We hit the road at 9. I wanted to give you time to get ready before everyone shows up.\n\n**AS:** There are other people coming?\n\n**ROB:** We got a 5 car convoy on the road today. They'll be here in an hour.\n\nThis is the first I’ve heard of a convoy, and to be honest I’m surprised. The game is Rob's obsession, and I’m here at his request. The idea that anyone else would have an interest in today's drive is a little perplexing.\n\nHalf an hour later, sated, showered and dressed in the \"functional clothing\" Rob had so painstakingly outlined, I take my pack out to the porch. Rob’s already there, waiting for his associates to show up.\n\n**AS:** I thought you'd be conducting a few more errands.\n\n**ROB:** If you ain't prepared by the morning of, you ain't prepared.\n\n**AS:** Hah ok I guess that's fair. Oh, Rob is the garage locked? The inside door won't budge and I wanted to mic up the car.\n\n**ROB:** Yeah it's locked up I'll open it for ya.\n\n**AS:** Thank you.\n\n**ROB:** In fact it's about time I wheeled her out. Fair warning Ms Sharma, she's a thing of beauty.\n\nTo Rob Guthard, beauty took the form of a dark green Jeep Wrangler. Rob climbs in and lets it roll out of the garage, where it dominates every inch of driveway. The car is large; four doors with a roof enclosing the entire compartment. It’s also been modified extensively, yet another example of Rob's dedication to the game.\n\n**ROB:** What're you thinking?\n\n**AS:** I think you're two caterpillar treads short of driving a tank.\n\n**ROB:** Hah yeah I fixed her up good. I put the winch in, heavy duty tires, the light rig on top is LED's. They'll make midnight look like noon but they don't use hardly any power.\n\n**AS:** Aren't Jeeps open top usually?\n\n**ROB:** Not all. This is the Unlimited. I like to have a covered car when I head on the road.\n\nI climb in and stow my pack. Rob had removed the back seats to afford more storage space. The place is packed to the brim. Jerry cans of gasoline, barrels of water, rope, snacks and his own neatly packed set of clothes.\n\nI wonder if the rest of our convoy would take the game so seriously.\n\n**ROB:** We got Apollo coming up in 10 minutes. No one else has given me a time. I sent the schedule weeks ago, this always happens.\n\n**AS:** His name's Apollo?\n\n**ROB:** That's his call sign. Apollo Creed I think he said.\n\n**AS:** Why are you using call signs?\n\n**ROB:** Did I not tell you? Oh yeah we're gonna use call signs on the road, keep communication clear.\n\n**AS:** What's your callsign?\n\n**ROB:** Ferryman.\n\n**AS:** ... What's my call sign?\n\n**ROB:** I thought about it. I was thinking London, you're from London right?\n\n**AS:** I'm from Bristol.\n\n**ROB:** Bristol? That’s fine I guess.\n\nIt’s less than ten minutes before Apollo turns the corner. Rob jumps out of his chair and paces briskly over to the edge of his property, as his first guest pulls up and steps onto the sidewalk.\n\nApollo vaguely resembles his namesake, dark skinned, tall and noticeably well built, though it’s clear he couldn’t be less of a fighter. This Apollo Creed is all smiles and seems to have a penchant for laughing at his own jokes.\n\n**AS:** How far have you come?\n\n**APOLLO:** I've come out of Chicago. Took three days hard driving.\n\n**AS:** And you know Rob from the forums?\n\n**APOLLO:** Everybody knows Rob, Rob's the god! Ahaha\n\nRob walks over to Apollo's car, gesturing him over to talk shop. Rob’s clearly impressed with Apollo's choice of vehicle, a blue Range Rover packed to the ceiling with kit. I was more impressed with Rob himself. Somehow this 65 year old farmer's son had become respected in a vast online community. My dad is Rob’s age and he's just discovered copy and paste.\n\nThe rest don't take long to arrive. Two Minnesotan librarians, also around Rob's age, pull up in a grey Ford Focus. They’re brother and sister, and they've shared ghost hunting as a hobby their entire lives. I find it hard to suppress a smile when they meekly introduce themselves as Bonnie and Clyde.\n\n**CLYDE:** We would have gotten here sooner we had to drop by to get some blankets. Pleasure to meet you ma'am.\n\n**AS:** Pleasure to meet you too.\n\n**CLYDE:** Would you be the journalist?\n\n**AS:** That's right.\n\n**CLYDE:** You used to write for the town paper didn't you?\n\nHe's talking to his sister there, she nods. Clyde is clearly the spokesperson for the pair, yet they both seem incredibly shy. Whether they admire the famous outlaws, or just the name, it's pretty clear they couldn't be more different from the real thing.\n\nNext to show up are Lilith and Eve, English Lit students at New York University and proprietors of the YouTube channel Paranormicon. Unlike Bonnie and Clyde, Lilith and Eve have no issue holding a conversation. As soon as they learn who I am, and what I do for a living, they attempt to conscript me for an expedition to Roswell.\n\n**LILITH:** We have a friend there, he's been seeing some-\n\n**EVE:** -He's a seismologist\n\n**LILITH:** Yeah and he's been recording readings over the years that show subterranean movement. Predictable movement.\n\n**EVE:** We're going to see him in July, but we could work it around you if you're free.\n\n**AS:** I'll have to check my schedule\n\n**EVE:** OK cool let me give you my email...\n\nThey quickly hurry off to film an intro for their latest video, featuring a quick interview with Rob, who seems pretty welcoming of the attention.\n\nThe last two cars arrive within a few seconds of each other. A lithe, strong willed older lady who goes by Bluejay and a younger man going by the callsign “Ace”. Bluejay has arrived in a grey Ford Explorer. Ace, much to Rob's annoyance, has arrived in a Porsche.\n\n**ROB:** Did you think that's gonna help on the road? I didn't write that-\n\n**ACE:** It's my car. What am I meant to do,? It's my car.\n\n**ROB:** You didn't read my itinerary, you got nothing packed in there.\n\n**ACE:** I did read it sir OK? Calm down. I have a bag, I won't ask you for anything.\n\n**ROB:** Well I know that's true.\n\nAce and Rob were off to a bad start. Ace takes a phone call, and despite my best efforts to get an interview with Bluejay, she doesn't seem interested in talking to a journalist.\n\nWith five cars, and seven travellers waiting for a green light, Rob hands out radios and charging packs, then launches into a quick safety briefing. Wear seatbelts. Stay in position. Communicate clearly and often. It’s at this moment I start to feel a little dismay. I like Rob, and clearly so does everyone else. He'd convinced all of them to drive across the country to join in with his game. I start to worry what will happen in the likely event that the whole thing isn’t real. Would Rob lose the respect of his peers? Would he accept failure when it comes? After seeing the effort he’s put into these runs, the next few hours have the potential to be wildly uncomfortable.\n\nWith a smile and a few encouraging words, Rob ends his briefing and beckons me over to the Wrangler. I clamber inside and make myself as comfortable as possible.\n\n**ROB:** You ready for this Bristol?\n\n**AS:** I'm ready.\n\n**ROB:** Ok then let's hit the road.\n\nThe Wrangler pulls out of the driveway, and the convoy follows in order of arrival. Apollo, Bonnie & Clyde, Lilith & Eve, Bluejay and Ace keep a steady pace behind us as we come up to the first corner.\n\nRob slowly and deliberately turns left, checking on the others in his rear view mirror. He looks back to the road as Ace’s Porsche completes the first turn of the game. Shortly afterwards, Apollo checks in on the CB radio.\n\n**APOLLO:** This is Apollo for Ferryman. How many to more go Rob? ahahaha\n\n**ROB:** Hah as many as it takes.\n\nI can tell Rob wanted the to reserve the radio for something other than Apollo's quips. But he seems to like Apollo enough to let it slide. I'm not sure Ace would have received the same treatment. We take the next right, then another left. Now safely assured that everyone's following correctly, Rob speaks my thoughts aloud.\n\n**ROB:** You're wondering the same thing Apollo is.\n\n**AS:** What do you mean?\n\n**ROB:** You're wondering how many turns we're gonna take before we hit some wall or something. Before you find out this is all just a story.\n\n**AS:** Does that disappoint you?\n\n**ROB:** I'd be disappointed if you weren't thinking something like it. But now we're on the road I gotta say something and you gotta listen to it.\n\n**AS:** OK...\n\n**ROB:** We're coming up to a tunnel soon. Any time before we reach it you can get out, walk in any direction you like, and you won’t be in the game no more. Once we go through, you gotta retrace the route we took to get yourself back out that tunnel. That's when you’re home. And you gotta convince someone to take you back in a car coz I ain't ferrying you back 20 minutes in. You got till the tunnel to skip out on this, understand?\n\n**AS:** I understand. Though I have to say I'm getting little nervous.\n\n**ROB:** Ain't nothing wrong with a little nervous.\n\nWe've taken 23 turns by this point. Already I feel like we're traversing the city pretty effectively. Rob's heavily modified Wrangler solicits a few impressed glances from passersby, as well as several honks of respect from other Jeep drivers. Other than those few moments, everything seems completely indistinguishable from a regular morning drive. I even start to worry if there’ll be anything at all for this story. “Reporter Takes Drive With Interesting Man” isn’t exactly Pulitzer worthy.\n\nTurn 33 leads us onto a short, unassuming street. A row of small businesses in a quiet Phoenician neighbourhood; liquor, second hand clothing, tools and, at the end of the street, a little shop selling antique mirrors. Ten or so people shuffle along the sidewalk, smiling, talking, planning their weekends. The only lone person is a young woman in a grey coat..\n\nI briefly glimpse her at the end of the street, standing on our next corner, the back of her coat reflected in fifty old mirrors. Even from a distance I can see that she’s sullen, wide eyed and nervous. She shifts constantly on her feet, tugging at the button of her coat.\n\nI look away to write some notes as we roll down the street. When I look up again, the woman is standing by my window, staring right at me. She’s smiling, a wide, unfaltering grin that seems almost offensive in its complete insincerity.\n\n**GREYWOMAN:** Lambs at the gate. Hoping for something better than clover when all they find are things worse than slaughter.\n\n**AS:** Rob what's happening?\n\n**ROB:** Ignore her.\n\n**GREYWOMAN:** He wanted to leave me so I cut him out. The lake was hungry it drank the wound clean.\n\n**AS:** Miss, are you alright?\n\nThe smile vanishes, it snaps from her face and suddenly, the woman is furious.\n\n**GREYWOMAN:** What do you think you're doing?! Have you gone mad?!\n\nI reflexively press myself back in my chair as the woman, wild eyed and gaunt, slams her fists against my window, with every intent of breaking through.\n\n**GREYWOMAN:** Would you dance down the lion’s tongue? It will shred you, you whore! It will shred you down to your sins! You fucking bastard!\n\nRob puts his foot down, and the Wrangler rolls defiantly away from the woman. As we turn the corner I watch her as she wretches, her every movement cradled in abject hysteria. She yells despairingly at the rest of the convoy, bursting into tears when the last car passes her by. \n\nAs she shrinks into the rear view mirror, I see her turn to a large mirror on the side of the shop, which the owner is in the process of polishing. I watch as she walks up to it, and with a convulsant scream, slams her head into the glass.\n\nThe mirror cracks around her forehead, the owner jumps back in shock, and as the woman pulls her head from the mirror's surface, the fractured spider’s web is dripping red. It all happens in a split second, and she quickly swerves from my view as we take the next left.\n\n**AS:** Rob, what was that?\n\n**ROB:** She's there sometimes.\n\n**AS:** On that street?\n\n**ROB:** On the 34th turn.\n\n**AS:** Who is she?\n\n**ROB:** I don't know. She's never acted out that much before though. Must be a special trip.\n\nI find Rob's lack of concern a little unpleasant, and his implication that this woman's ravings were the symptom of an internet game leaves me more than a little perturbed. As I see it, there are a few explanations for what just happened, and none of them lead to a comforting conclusion.\n\nIf we had just encountered a bonafide crazy person, then one could argue that Rob is just seeing what he wants to see. Maybe he'd bought into the game’s story so much that every strange but explainable occurrence would be rationalised as the next step in his favourite paranormal narrative.\n\nAlternatively, the woman could have been an actor, a more elaborate theory sure, but not unheard of. People have lied to the show before and Rob was receiving a tonne of publicity for this attempt from Lilith, Eve and I. I admit, Rob didn't seem like a liar, but good liars never do.\n\nThere is a third alternative however. An alternative which, if you put logic aside, explains the all troubling little details that I couldn't help but notice. Because as strange as the grey woman was, isn't it stranger that no one on the street would react? I couldn't recall a single glance in her direction by anybody on the sidewalk. Perhaps that theory falls apart when you consider the shock on the mirror seller's face but, when I think about it, he only reacted once the mirror shattered, and even then, I feel like his attention was on the mirror itself.\n\nThe radio crackles.\n\n**LILITH:** Lillith to Bristol. Sara... Eve got that on camera! Do you have audio?\n\n**AS:** I think it picked her up.\n\n**LILITH:** My god that was so weird. Can you send us the file when we stop? Can you ask Ferryman when we're stopping?\n\n**AS:** When's our stopping point?\n\n**ROB:** For them, in about 30 minutes. For you? Well, you tell me.\n\nRob turns off a busy street just before a large intersection, onto a much quieter stretch of two lane road. Ahead of us the road slopes downward, leading into an underpass, which disappears into darkness.\n\nWe'd arrived at the tunnel.\n\n**AS:** What is this supposed to pass under?\n\n**ROB:** Ain't supposed to pass under anything, it's just there.\n\n**AS:** And if we weren't playing the game?\n\n**ROB:** Then it won't show. The question is, are you playing the game or not?\n\nRob turns to me. It’s the first time he’s taken his eyes off the road since we started. He pulls the car to a slow stop at the mouth of the tunnel.\n\n**ROB:** You get out now you can go wherever you wanna go, but through there you'll need a car to get yourself home and, like I said, mine ain't turnin round for a long while. You understand?\n\nIt’s a dramatic statement, but unsettlingly, it doesn’t feel like he’s attempting to dramatise. It feels like I’m having something genuinely asked of me. Am I ready for what’s to come? Do I accept the risks involved? Do I consent to be taken down this road, and the next road, and the next? Am I prepared to see this game through, real or otherwise, to its end?\n\n**AS:** What are you waiting for?\n\nRob smiles, and turns back to the road. He picks up the CB radio holds down the button on the side. The microphone crackles.\n\n**ROB:** This is Ferryman to all cars. Anyone want to step out then pull to the side now. Otherwise, stay in formation and have some supplies at hand. We got a long ways to go.\n\nMuch like the game I’m so tentatively playing, my view of Robert J. Guthard seems to change direction frequently. I’d heard all about his life, but I’m sure that I know him. I like the guy, but I’m not certain that I trust him. And though I admire his dedication to the Left\/Right Game, I’m not sure I’ll like where it might lead us. Yet as he takes us into the tunnel, his face vanishing and reappearing under the dim sodium lights, I can that tell he expects this trip to be a major step in his already impressive story, and this time, for better or for worse, I’m along for the ride."},"240":{"title":"The previous tenant of my new flat left a survival guide.

I’m so stressed and I’ve barely slept since I discovered that Jamie was missing. It’s starting to make me feel a little twitchy. But I thought I’d better update you guys. \n\nI was overwhelmed by all the suggestions you gave me and have taken more than a few of them on board. I’m definitely going to be getting a huge planter full of sage for the balcony and I did spill a little salt in my doorway. I’m sorry to disappoint but that didn’t help at all. \n\nThere’s nothing I’m following quite like Mrs Hemming’s rules. I’ve followed them to the letter so far, and lo and behold I’m still alive. That’s not to say it hasn’t been tough. Il start from the beginning. \n\n\n\n\nI was going crazy. And a few hours after my last post Jamie still hadn’t returned. He had been gone for almost 24 hours. His work have called me multiple times. I don’t know what to say so I just keep ghosting the calls. \n\nI was bang in the middle of the danger time when I decided checking the lift had to be my first step. But I wasn’t going to break that rule. \n\nI waited. I waited desperately for 3.34 to come and I’m ashamed to say that when it did I remained paralysed to our sofa for almost half an hour before I found the nerve to leave the flat. It was 4.02 when I finally reached the lift. \n\nThe lift in this building is old and rickety. It hasn’t been updated in a very long time and has likely been here as long as the building. It’s big, clunky buttons stared back at me as I glared at them, hoping for some sort of answer or clue. My heart thumped and I was overcome with a feeling of dread but nothing came of any of it. It was hopeless. \n\nI stepped inside the lift, rode it up and down a few floors and searched the entire perimeter with a phone torch for anything I could find. I found nothing. Jamie had completely disappeared. \n\nSobbing and exhausted I rode back to floor 7 and turned my key in flat 42, the perfect home that felt anything but home at that point. \n\nI sat at the cheap flat pack dining table we’d managed to put together on move-in day and cried. My hands shaking as I held my phone. \n\nI was flitting between reading all your comments and contemplating calling the police for an hour. But I decided to call my friend Georgia instead. I needed a real person here, things were so crazy I wasn’t sure the police would be able to help with what little information I had. But I knew I needed to sound it out with someone.\n\nIl spare you the details again, but I told her everything. She promised she’d be with me in the late morning, she had to take her younger brother to school. \n\nI waited anxiously. Not before arming every room exactly as advised. Before I knew it I looked at the clock and it was 8.23, I had around half an hour until the postman was due to show up. \n\nThere was no way I was missing him today. I stood by the door looking vacantly at the wood, like someone in a film who was possessed. The exhaustion was really setting in but Jamie was all I could think of. Pure adrenaline was keeping me standing. \n\nAt 8.52 I opened the door. The next two minutes were the longest of my life but when I saw him a wave of relief swept my entire body. \n\nRight on cue, 8.54 the postman, Ian Flanders stood in front of me, a smile that barely hid his concern covering his younger than expected face. He didn’t look old enough to have been the postman for over 35 years but I was too  distracted by the answers that I needed from him to care.\n\n“You must be the new tenant.” He stated, but in a way that it sounded like a question. I struggled with my answer, so I got straight to the point.\n\n“Mrs Hemmings left me a note, she said to speak to you if - “\n\n“Can I come in dear? I think we need to chat.”\n\nI ushered Ian in, my hands still shaking as I flapped them in the direction of the sofa, gesturing for him to sit down. I shoved the now slightly crumpled note into his lap and waited. \n\n“I’m glad Prue still thinks that highly of me. I will miss that old girl.” He said with a coy smile as he reached the end of the note. \n\n“Can you help me or not?” I had no time for his ego trip over a moved on neighbour. \n\n“I can help. But I can’t stop for long so it’ll have to be quick. I’ve walked these halls delivering the post for 40 years. I’ve seen it all, everything Prue’s mentioned and more. What do you need to know?” He said.\n\nIan was nothing like what I expected. The note made me feel like he was going to be a kindly, old grandad type figure, but I couldn’t have been more wrong. Postman Ian spoke with a thick city accent, and wore a heavy gold chain around his tattooed neck. He had dyed his greying hair boot polish black.\n\nHis demeanour was thankfully non threatening but extraordinarily cocky. He was the sort of man I imagined in a betting shop, rubbing his grubby hands on notes as he bragged over a win. \n\nHe didn’t ask as he lit a cigarette in my living room. I didn’t question it, we would usually smoke outside but I wasn’t going to argue over technicalities. I grabbed a bowl for the ash and lit one too. \n\n“Let’s start with the things in the lift. My boyfriend is missing and he took the lift at quarter past 3 over 24 hours ago. We hadn’t got this note yet. I haven’t heard from him since. I need to get him back.” I barked at him as if the louder I spoke the more I could influence his answer. But nothing prepared me for what he said. \n\nHis skin turned pale and his harsh looking face became more sympathetic as he explained. \n\n“He’s dead, love. Forget about him now. Only one person has ever come back from the lift at that time of night and it was Prue herself. After witnessing it. Those creatures ripping their victim apart. Poor Prue was traumatised. Your boy is gone, let go and follow the rules.” He was blunt but I could tell he felt sorry for me. \n\n“There must be something I can do!” I pleaded.\n\n“There are things I’ve heard to bring back those who are lost but I’ve never seen solid proof they work. It would be irresponsible of me to tell you to do something that might get you killed too. It’s nice here, honest, just get over him and live the status quo. Sorry if I sound harsh, I don’t mean to, but you seem like a decent young lady and I don’t want to see you go too soon.”\n\nI asked about what Mrs Hemmings had seen in the lift and if they were sure it happened to all who entered it. I refused to believe that Jamie was dead. There had to be something I could do and if I knew what I was dealing with I could be better prepared. \n\n“It was awful what happened. I wasn’t there, but this is what I was told. \n\nLittle Lyla was such a cute kid. She used to open the door and give me a tip when I delivered the post. She was Prue’s granddaughter. Lyla was her sons little girl and that night She was staying over for the first time. Prue finally felt confident that she could protect Lyla from all the strange things that happen here...\n\nShe was wrong. Little Lyla had a problem with sleepwalking. And she took a trip into the hallway at half 1 in the morning, Prue took a little too long to notice the sound she had heard was the front door and by the time she reached the lift she saw the creatures dragging Lyla’s limbs away from her body. She tried to fight them, even killed one, but she couldn’t save the little girl.” \n\nI was hysterical, imagining Jamie’s fate.\n\n“What are the creatures? Have you ever actually seen them.” I asked.\n\n“No one really knows what they are love. They’re something to do with the building and all its quirks, no ones ever seen them elsewhere. We don’t know where they came from, just that they’re here. \n\nI’ve seen them a few times over the years, usually when new neighbours have left biscuits down for their cats and dogs or haven’t disposed of food waste properly. \n\nThey’re curious little creatures. Mostly harmless out of the hours Prue warned you about, but if they’re fed they can become quite viscous looking for more food. \n\nThat’s why you have to bin all your scraps, or hide them or pack them or whatever. Just don’t leave them out and don’t use the lift at those times and you’re safe from the creatures. \n\nThey’re a little smaller than humans, but they’re a similar shape, they come with grotesque rodent like features, and are far larger than any rodent could be. Like rodent children I suppose. They have two sharp rows of teeth per jaw and are consistently hungry. \n\nWhen they eat they crunch down in a violent and disgusting way, dripping spittle everywhere, Prue said she could hear her granddaughters bones shatter in those jaws.” He went pale at the thought of that, but continued.\n\n“When they first arrived in the building there were hundreds, it caused pandemonium amongst the residents. We lost the residents of more than 30 of the individual homes. But the residents fought back and managed to kill all but the strongest minority of them. \n\nThe creatures left over were incredibly dangerous and seemingly impossible to eradicate, so the residents struck a deal. A deal that they will be left unharmed and allowed to live in the building in return for the residents safety at all times, but if anyone wanders into the lift between 1.11 and 3.33am they are fair game. \n\nThis timeframe is the period the creatures are at their most frenzied and restricting them to the lift was safer for all parties. God help anyone who encounters them during those hours.\n\nThey’ve been here ever since, claimed lots of unsuspecting people avoiding the stairs, but nothing like when they first arrived. A few got put down for not holding up their end of the bargain but we haven’t had an incident outside the lift in years. Count yourself lucky you missed that crisis. \n\nEverything here’s pretty peaceful right now. I’m sorry about your boyfriend. I really have to go, I’m late for my round.” He scrawled his phone number on a bit of paper and handed it to me. “Emergencies only, I don’t like to be bothered.”\n\n“You can’t go! The note said you would help me!” I exclaimed.\n\n“And I will!” He snapped back, “when there’s something I can help with. I can’t resurrect your boyfriend and I don’t like to be late delivering the post. I will see you soon love.”\n\nI was in shock, I couldn’t believe what I was hearing, and I couldn’t believe he was leaving me after the information overload and the small ray of hope he had lit inside me and then squashed. \n\n“I’ll call the police!” I shouted, desperate to feel as if I was solving this somehow.\n\n“You can try if you want.” Ian sighed, as he opened the door to leave. “It just aggravates the creatures, and it isn’t going to bring your boy back. Mr prentice hates it when police come too, if you want to get any sleep in the next week then I’d avoid it. Wait a week, report him missing and learn to adapt to life here love, or you’ll be dead in days.”\n\nAnd with that he shut the door behind him. I opened it again, I had so much more to ask, but he was gone, no sign of him anywhere in the corridor. \n\nMaybe it was me losing my mind, I might be imagining all these things. But no matter how much I willed it the note was still there. And Jamie still wasn’t.\n\n\n\n\nGeorgia arrived not long after Ian had left. I, of course, asked if she had seen him in the corridor, to try and affirm to myself that he was real, but she hadn’t. She looked at me worried, and held me as I sobbed and told her what the postman had said about Jamie and the creatures. \n\nI wasn’t sure she believed me. Even as she read the note she looked skeptical. If she was skeptical I wouldn’t have blamed her, but she had always been supportive. She sat with me for hours while I just sobbed, heartbroken. I was so conflicted as to what do to. It felt insane that I hadn’t contacted anybody, but this note had turned out to be accurate so far and if the postman was to be trusted then I should wait. \n\nGeorgia had been my best friend for many years, she stuck up for me when I was too scared to do it for myself and had always been the brave one of the two of us. I felt safe around her, so after hours of crying and despairing at the way my life had changed in a matter of days I finally decided to take a nap. It was early evening and Georgia was watching some tv. Just there for me if I needed her.\n\nDespite the deprivation, I struggled to fall asleep, I tried to imagine Jamie’s arms around me but it became a more painful reminder that they probably never will be again. Eventually, after what felt like an eternity of staring at the damp patch on ceiling I drifted off. \n\nAbout three hours ago, I woke up, staring at the goddamn damp patch on the ceiling and could hear chatting in the living room. I jumped out of bed and walked towards it.\n\nGeorgia was on the sofa, with a middle aged looking woman, both nursing a cup of tea in the matching mugs that Jamie had got me as a move in present. My blood boiled but it wasn’t their fault, I cleared my throat to get their attention. \n\n“Oh Katie! This is Natalia, she lives upstairs. We got chatting so I made her a cup of tea. I hope you don’t mind.” I looked at the dark haired woman on the sofa, drinking tea from my cup and nodded. Georgia was a sociable idiot with no understanding of when to not be herself. I wasn’t going to lament her for it right now. It was her coping. \n\n“Of course. Hi Natalia, what flat do you live in?” I tried my very best to be polite. I would have to discuss not bringing people into my home mid tragedy with Georgia after she had left but until then I would be neighbourly.\n\n“Flat 71. It’s so nice to meet you, you have a lovely home.” Natalia responded, her lips curled at the corners into a smile that wasn’t replicated in her eyes or the rest of her facial expression. She looked at me smugly, with full knowledge that I was aware of the implications of what she had just said.\n\nThe rules...\n\nThe flat number....\n\n*every now and again someone will knock at your door claiming to live in one of these flats and ask to borrow some sugar. They will seem entirely average but you must shut and lock the door immediately. I installed two extra security bolts to avoid these fuckers. I don’t like to swear at my age but they really are fuckers.*\n\nPrue’s warning echoed in my mind and I couldn’t take my eyes off Natalia. Something really was off about her. I looked at Georgia sat on the sofa next to her and noticed her sweating. Anyone in the uk knows that it’s been a hot for few days but this was beyond just the ambient temperature. Her entire body was dripping. \n\nSuddenly, she began to pant. Natalia’s eyes were locked to mine just like the window cleaners had been. Nothing happened before with the cleaner, except this time the rule had been broken. She was already in the flat. \n\nGeorgia started to scream as her skin blistered and charred. Her hair fell from her scalp as the skin flaked and melted away from every inch of her. She was being burned alive without a flame in sight. She scratched frantically at her own melting face, digging into the exposed raw flesh. The sound a person makes when they burn alive is like no other. That will never leave me. \n\nI screamed and screamed but no one came to my door. I tried to grab my phone to call postman Ian but the wooden surface I had set it down on burned my fingers to the touch and forced me to recoil. She was going to set the whole flat alight. \n\nMy actions needed to be quicker than a phone call. \n\nI grabbed hold of the large knife I had set down on the side earlier when weaponising, the handle blistered my fingers instantly but I didn’t care, I needed to get her out now and help Georgia if I could. I ran towards the dark haired lady, sweat dripping from my brow the closer I got and plunged the knife into Natalia’s throat. She gripped it and fell to the floor. \n\nShe didn’t bleed like a normal human. Her insides were black, she was still moving, and I figured it probably wouldn’t be long before she stood right back up and tried again. So I dragged her into the hallway ready to bolt the door. \n\nAs we reached the entrance of the corridor one of the cats was waiting, hissing at her semi conscious body, I caught her eyes fixate on it as I dumped her on the floor. I grabbed the cat, pulled him inside, wincing as it’s skin caused more burns up my lower arms, shut the door and watched through the peep hole. She got up and held her hand to the wound, cauterising it and walking off towards the lift. As if she hadn’t been injured at all. \n\nI’d dropped the cat by that point but every bit of naked skin it had touched throbbed and burned for at least an hour. \n\nGeorgia hadn’t been as lucky as Natalia with injury recovery. I anonymously called an ambulance for her. I couldn’t believe it but she was still breathing. She was badly burned and her life wouldn’t be the same again but she was alive. And for that I was grateful. \n\nIt sounds awful but I left her at the park across the road from the building. With no phone or i.d. She’s my best friend and I want to be there but if I own up to involvement in injuries that bad they’ll suspect me, and I lose the already slim chance that Jamie might be saveable. It doesn’t mean I don’t care about Georgia, but she’s alive. I won’t believe Jamie isn’t until I see it. \n\nSo now I’m alone again, in the flat, conflicted about what to do. \n\nI want to leave. So badly. But this was mine and Jamie’s first home together. If he’s alive, and I can save him then I want it to be here for him to come back to... and if he’s dead, and the postman is right then I don’t know if I can leave his memory behind. \n\nThere’s only one person I think could help me right now. So tonight I’m going to do some research, hunt down an address and tomorrow morning I’m going to visit Prudence Hemmings.\n\nHow it went: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/cj2g4k\/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app"},"241":{"title":"Dad shut himself inside his bunker at the start of the pandemic.

I remember focusing on the water hitting the windowpanes while my sister tried to change Dad’s mind. I knew it was no use. He was too stubborn to listen to anyone except maybe Donald Trump. WHO had just declared that COVID-19 had pushed the world into a pandemic. Dad wanted us to join him and when we told him no, he called us brainwashed.\n\nHe purchased the land before I was born. Only because of the dilapidated military facility that came with it. It was abandoned sometime in the 60s, I think. My sister was there from the beginning, even before Dad’s obsession pushed Mom away. It’s hard for me to imagine what he was like back then. Mom says he was a gentleman. But they married young, and a person can change a lot during those years. And so did Dad. All I remember from him during childhood are the weekends at the bunker. Constantly renovating it and stockpiling it with everything he would need to survive down there.\n\nWe couldn’t stop him. He wasn’t the best Dad, not even a good one, but it was sad to see him go all the same. He was excited, even though he thought that civilization was about to collapse. I guess that happens when you’ve spent your entire adult life preparing. We had to set up an old radio to keep in touch with him. He didn’t trust mobile phones. We didn’t hear from him often, just once a month, sometimes less. The last time he radioed in, he said he had found a hidden door. He was going to see where it went. That was three months ago.\n\n“You think he’s okay?” my sister said. “He wasn’t in great health. I *told* him.”\n\nWe sat in the car, on our way to check up on him, driving through the heatwave.\n\n“His radio might have broken down,” I said. “Let’s not assume the worst.”\n\nBut I felt worried too. There was something strange about that hidden door, and his tone when he mentioned it. It didn’t sit right with me. But maybe it was just the heat and the endless desert around us that played tricks on my mind. I couldn’t really tell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was dark when we arrived. Dad’s truck stood where he had left it, beneath some tarp that blew in the chilly, sand-carrying wind. We turned on our flashlights and walked to the cliff above the bunker. The steel door was made to withstand a nuclear blast. Luckily, I owned the only spare key in existence. Before I used it, I banged on the door as hard as I could and yelled for Dad. I worried he would mistake us for intruders and shoot us. If he was confused, and if it was dark, it was a real possibility. I banged again and yelled at the top of my lungs:\n\n“Dad, are you there? It’s me, Josh! Eveline is here as well!”\n\n“I don’t think he can hear you,” Eveline said.\n\nI nodded. “Dad! I’m going to open the door now!”\n\nI was seventeen the last time I was here. Back then it was the Muslims that were going to end civilization as we knew it. Before that, it was the Russians. Now it was China. There was always something threatening his beloved freedom, and yet he was never truly free. My sister put her hand on my wrist just as I was about to unlock the door.\n\n“You know,” she said. “Maybe we should just call the authorities after all and–”\n\n“No,” I said. “He’ll fight them.”\n\nI unlocked the heavy door. A rancid smell escaped the darkness inside. It was the odor of death. I recognized it from when Dad tried––and ultimately failed––to learn how to hunt and let a reindeer carcass rot on the property for weeks. My sister had already stopped visiting him by then. I didn’t tell her what the smell reminded me of. She covered her nose with her shirt. We descended the spiral stairs. It creaked for each step we took, almost as if it was about to fall apart.\n\nI tried the light switch at the bottom. The click echoed throughout the long corridor leading to the living area. Nothing happened.\n\n“Hm.” I realized that the batteries, which he charged by the use of an old exercise bike, were dead. That meant he was most likely dead as well. “The generator could be broken,” I said. “But… Maybe you should wait back here, just in case… you know.”\n\nI pointed my flashlight in front of me. The light was too weak to reach the end of the corridor. On the way here I had felt ready. I felt sad, the kind of empty sadness you feel after the death of a parent that was never any good, but I didn’t feel worried. Now, on the other hand, while staring into the dark corridor that I used to run through as a kid… I was afraid. The fear reminded me of how my childhood night terrors used to start. They always crept up on me in the darkness, grew with the grotesque shadows on my bedroom ceiling.\n\n“I’m not letting you go in there alone,” Eveline said. “We stay together.”\n\nWe walked into the darkness. The foul smell intensified for every step we took, and so did my heartbeat. I was glad my sister didn’t stay behind. The bunker seemed so much smaller than I remembered it, much more cramped. The asymmetry between my memories and reality made everything feel off somehow, just as if the bunker was merely a model of the real thing. But it wasn’t. I had just grown up.\n\nThe Confederate flag greeted us at the end of the corridor. It hung on the concrete wall. It looked pale in the hotspot of the flashlight, almost like a phantom. And, of course, in many ways it was. A ghost from a time long ago. Or perhaps a corpse brought back to life. An abomination. It reminded me of Dad more than anything else.\n\n“You have to be seriously confused to praise freedom as much as Dad and hang that symbol of lesser freedom in the world on your wall,” Eveline said.\n\n“He wanted to protect his freedom so much that he built a prison for himself.” I removed the light from the flag, leaving only darkness. “You bet he was confused.”\n\nWe entered the main chamber. It was overfilled with litter and clutter. Empty cans––both the food and beer kinds––lay scattered across the sticky floor. We had to take large steps not to step on any of the trash.\n\n“That’s weird.” Eveline pointed her flashlight at the small dining table. “Look.”\n\nMy hair stood up on my neck before I even realized what she meant. The table was set for three people. I didn’t say anything for a moment, trying to process what I was seeing, and just when I was about to speak my sister interrupted me:\n\n“Who the *fuck* was here with him?”\n\n“We don’t know–” I began. “I mean, he might have left the old plates on the table and–”\n\nA sound of something falling to the ground came from one of the other rooms further into the bunker. I pointed my light in its direction but couldn’t see what made it.\n\n“Dad!” I yelled. “It’s me, Josh! You there?”\n\nNo response.\n\n“I’m afraid,” Eveline whispered. “Something isn’t right.”\n\nI only vaguely heard what she said. My focus was on something else. Something on the wall on the other end of the room.\n\n“That’s not supposed to be there.” I slowly walked toward it. “That must have been what he talked about over the radio.”\n\nDad had hacked away a layer of concrete, for whatever reason, and uncovered a rusty, metal door behind it. It stood ajar. A lukewarm, musty breeze came out of it. My sister walked up to me as I carefully pried the door open with the back of my flashlight. I felt my heart in my throat. I could hear my sister begging for us to leave, almost in tears. But I needed to know what was behind that door. It was imperative to understand what had happened here. I needed to know. I needed closure.\n\n“What in heavens name…” Eveline looked over my shoulder. “Why is this here?”\n\nBehind the door was a room about the size of a broom cupboard. It was unremarkable except for a circular hole in the middle of the floor. I shone my light into it, but I couldn’t see the bottom. Just as I thought it was big enough for a person, my sister said:\n\n“Do you think he fell?”\n\nDrops of sweat from my forehead fell down the pit. I felt dizzy and stepped back, afraid I would fall inside. My sister picked up a can filled with some rotten beans and threw it down the hole. It clattered against the walls as it bounced from one side to another. The sound faded away until we couldn’t hear it anymore. There was no indication it touched down at the bottom. I stretched out my hand and held it above the opening.\n\n“It’s warm,” I said. “The air, I mean.”\n\n“Maybe he fell.” Eveline stepped back, almost as if she were convinced. “Can we please get out of here?” She reached for my arm. “We can return with the police. Please… Josh?”\n\n“It wasn’t dark when Dad found this,” I said. “He would have seen the hole.”\n\n“Josh? Please.”\n\n“Just give me a moment to think.” I walked toward the hallway that led to the other rooms, desperately hoping to find him. For some reason, it was important for me to see him. To be able to leave without wondering. I needed to know that he was truly dead. “I just want to–” I stopped myself after I accidentally pointed the flashlight on the floor in the middle of the hallway, revealing a pair of feet. “I think I found him!” I ran up to the body.\n\n“Wait!” Eveline yelled and reluctantly followed me to avoid being left alone.\n\nIt wasn’t Dad. I screamed upon the realization. My mind couldn’t comprehend what I had just seen. I spun around and tried to run away, completely acting on instinct, and crashed into my sister. She grabbed me, kept me still, and as she looked behind me, down at the dead body on the floor, she began to cry while her hands trembled uncontrollably against my shoulders.\n\n“Oh my God,” she said. “How… how is it possible? It’s you!”\n\n“Let’s get a fuck out of here,” I said. “Move!”\n\nThere was nothing that could explain this, and the more my mind tried to––moving in an endless loop doing so––the dread grew inside me. I only got a glimpse of the body before I panicked, but my sister was right. The half-rotten face was the same as mine, with a bullet hole in the middle of the forehead.\n\nWe stumbled our way through the living area, tipping over chairs and kicking cans all over the place, and just as we were about to get out of the mess a familiar voice echoed through the hallway we had just escaped.\n\n“Josh!”\n\nIt was Dad. We both stopped in our tracks.\n\n“Is that you? Josh!”\n\n“Dad?” I yelled back. “What the fuck is going on here?”\n\n“Don’t worry!” It sounded like he was at the other end of the bunker, possibly inside the storeroom. “I killed the son of a bitch, put a bullet right between his eyes!”\n\n“Come out from there!” I yelled. “We have to leave, it’s not safe here!”\n\nSilence.\n\n“Something is wrong,” Eveline said. “I don’t think–”\n\n“Dad!” I yelled. “Come out!”\n\n“I can’t move!” Dad said. “I’m stuck under a shelf! I’ll need your help, son!”\n\nI turned to my sister. “Go back up. I’ll get that old bastard out of there. We’ll be right behind you, okay?”\n\n“Think, Josh!” Eveline begged. “You think he’s been stuck under a shelf for–”\n\nI should have listened, but even after what we had just seen I just couldn’t bring myself to even consider something as outlandish as what my sister was suggesting. It was simply too far-fetched, too unbelievable to penetrate all my layers of presumptions about reality. It couldn’t be, it just couldn’t. Hence, I ran back to the hallway, yelling for my sister to get back up to the surface and wait for us there.\n\n“I’m coming, Dad!”\n\nI only slowed down to carefully step over the corpse that bore my face. Perhaps, I thought, it was just a coincidence. A burglar that just happened to look like me. After all, the face had begun to rot. It wasn’t obviously me. I felt stupid and I almost convinced myself that it was just my childhood fear of the dark coming back to life down here. And then, just as I was about to walk past the small composting toilet that stood inside a small room at the end of the hallway, I stopped. Shivers spread across my entire body, paralyzing me. Dad sat on the toilet. His gun still hung from his trigger finger and his brain was splattered across the wall behind him. He had his journal in his lap, covered in blood.\n\n“Josh!” Dad yelled from the darkness. “Help me!”\n\nI was frozen in place, both by fear and confusion, unable to make any decisions.\n\n“Come on, Josh!” Dad kept yelling. “I need your help, son!”\n\nMy mind was racing. There was no way of knowing who was who. When I heard Dad’s voice yelling for help while watching his dead body, nothing but absolute terror revibrated inside me. I slowly reached for the journal in Dad’s lap and grabbed it, hoping it would shed some light on the situation. I was just about to open it when my sister screamed. I ran back, this time jumping over my doppelgänger's body, and found her looking at something at the corner of the main chamber.\n\n“I told you to–” I said, but changed my mind. “Are you okay, what happened?”\n\n“It’s–” she cried. “It’s me.”\n\nCrawled up in the corner was her naked, dead body. Her head had been twisted in such a way that the neck had been broken.\n\n“There’s something seriously wicked going on here,” I said. “Dad shot himself in the head, a long time ago by the looks of it, and yet he keeps yelling for help. Let’s get back to the car, now!”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe drove away from the bunker as fast as we could, leaving whatever was still alive down there yelling for help. My sister insisted on staying at my place for a few days. I didn’t mind having her around. We shared an experience no one else could relate to, and we needed each other to overcome the trauma.\n\nIt took a day for me to build up the courage to open Dad’s journal. It began with his usual deranged conspiracy theories. I flipped past them. At the end, he had only made short notes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Found a hidden door.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Deep pit, possible the remains of some old black project.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Eveline and Josh woke me up.

They tried to make me* \\[Illegible\\]*!!!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*God help me, it isn’t them!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I shot the son of a bitch right between the eyes!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Hiding in the bathroom now, this will probably be my last entry.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*God forgive me.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChills went down my spine as I read the last entry on the blood-drenched page.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I never got the other one. She’s still out there somewhere. I only got one bullet left. I won’t allow her to do that abhorrent thing to me. Forgive me.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy sister has been cooking for hours. She just called for me from the kitchen:\n\n“Josh? Come here, I want to show you something!”\n\n[ME](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/tobiasmalm\/comments\/112r4le\/i_just_released_my_novel_the_cave_to_another\/)"},"242":{"title":"I volunteered to sit next to a dead man on a plane, and deeply regret it.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/dnsoza\/i_volunteered_to_sit_next_to_a_dead_man_on_a\/","flair":null,"author":"diesindarkness","selftext":"The man in seat 43-A died halfway across the Atlantic. I was sitting near the front of the plane, just behind first class, and couldn’t really see the commotion. But I could hear someone gasping and retching — loud at first, then quieter and quieter. A flight attendant got on the PA and asked for “any medical professionals among the passengers” to help. I guess there were none. \n\nAfter a few minutes, the man’s sounds deteriorated into a sort of gurgle, then silence, then it was over.\n\nHis name was Molyneaux, and he was old but not that old, and it was likely a heart attack, aneurism, drug reaction or God’s will, according to conflicting nth-hand reports that filtered down the plane from row 43, where a flight attendant simply buckled the newly deceased back into his window seat and covered his face with a complementary airline blanket.\n\nThe pilot got on the intercom and told us the plane would be turning back to New York “due to a tragic medical situation involving one of our passengers.”\n\n“Folks, we’re looking for a volunteer willing to sit next to the deceased while we return to our originating airport,” the pilot continued. “This flight is entirely full, and the person sitting there now isn’t feeling comfortable. It’s an aisle seat, and it will only be a few hours before we’re back over land.”\n\nI’m not sure why I volunteered — probably some combination of exhaustion, altruism and morbid curiosity. My vacation plans were shot anyway, I figured, so why not take the most interesting seat on the plane? The flight attendant thanked me profusely, as did a queasy looking teenager who took my original seat. I picked up my handbag and shuffled down the aisle to the very last row of the plane.\n\nMy only prior experience with corpses was an open casket funeral for my grandmother when I was a kid, but the idea of death had never particularly bothered me. It’s natural, after all. That said, I admit that I second-guessed my decision as soon as I saw my new seat mate.\n\nMr. Molyneaux, rest in peace, sat upright between the window and me, strapped around the waist, with a blue fleece blanket covering his torso and head. The blanket did not cover his hands, which were resting on his lap above his seatbelt — placed that way by a flight attendant as a sign of respect, I assumed. \n\nMolyneaux’s pale fingers were twisted into claws that betrayed the agony of his death. I couldn’t look at those hands without imagining what his face looked like under the blanket.\n\nI thought of asking for a second blanket, but the flight crew was still busy calming down other passengers and preparing for our u-turn around the Atlantic Ocean. So I tried to forget my uneasiness and closed my eyes, and slept.\n\nI woke — hours or minutes later, I don’t know — to the jostling of turbulence. The cabin lights were off and most of the passengers around me seemed to be sleeping. I looked out the window, trying not to look at Molyneaux as I did so, and saw only the uniform blackness of the night. I imagined the ocean miles below us, lightless and cold. The thought unsettled me and I reached across Molyneaux to close the window shade.\n\nThen I stopped myself. *Hadn’t the shade been closed when I sat down?*\n\nI realized there was something else off about the scene. Molyneaux’s posture had somehow changed while I slept. It took me a few seconds to pinpoint it. His gnarled hands remained on his lap, he was still belted at the waist, and the blanket still shrouded his upper body. But the fabric looked somehow twisted now, as if he had been fidgeting.\n\nVery slowly — knowing it was insane even as I knew I couldn’t stop myself — I lifted a corner the blanket. \n\nI uncovered his shirt, which the flight crew had unbuttoned while trying to save him. A patch of blue-grey skin sprouting white chest hair peeked out from it.\n\nI lifted the blanket higher. His collar was flecked with dried blood. I remembered his terrible gasping.\n\nFinally, I pulled the blanket entirely off, and stifled a scream.\n\nMolyneaux’s head was turned away from me, exactly as if he had turned to stare out the window. \n\nI could see his face reflected in the plexiglass. It was undoubtably a dead man’s face: pale, drawn, lips parted, jaw slack. There was no life in it.\n\nExcept his eyes. They were moving.\n\nI stared at the reflection for half a minute and I’m sure of it. In the center of that death mask, two pupils flicked back and forth, as if tracking something out there in the sky.\n\n“What are you doing?” a voice beside me interrupted. I whipped around and saw the woman seated across the aisle staring at me — not so much in fear as disgust. “Cover him back up! Give him his peace.”\n\n“He’s … I think he’s been moving,” I stammered. “His eyes. I think he might not actually be ….” \n\nBut I couldn’t finish the sentence; it was too crazy. Nor did I have to, because at that moment my stomach dropped ten feet along with everything else in the plane. \n\nCoffee cups and purses slammed against the ceiling. A man near the first class section nearly tumbled out of his seat. I heard call lights going off all over the plane as passengers were jolted awake in panic and confusion.\n\n“Passengers, please take your seats, buckle in, and secure any loose items,” the pilot said over the PA, sounding shaken himself. “The weather along our flight path is clear and no planes in the area are reporting turbulence, so I’m not sure what this is. But we should be through it momentarily.”\n\nEven as he spoke, the mild background shaking I’d felt since waking up became noticeably more violent. The woman across the aisle began fumbling for her seatbelt, no longer paying any attention to me or Molyneaux.\n\nI forced myself to look at him again. The jolt must have caused him to pitch forward at the waist, his head colliding with the seat in front of him. \n\nBut Molyneaux’s face was still turned toward the window — his neck twisted at such a sharp angle that I worried it had snapped.\n\nI looked at his hands again, and the pallor of his skin. Three flight attendants and a dozen passengers had witnessed this man’s death, and I could not rationally imagine they were mistaken. \n\nAnd yet in the reflection of the window, his eyes left to right, left to right.\n\nI had heard that strange reflexes sometimes kick in after death — limbs flailing, headless chickens running, nerves clearing out the last backlog of instructions from the brain. But the eyes? I had never heard of that.\n\nI made myself look past that unsettling reflection, at the sky itself. It was still dark, moonless and cloudless, but the atmosphere seemed to have taken on a strange hue — a very dark green, like pea soup fog. I thought I could see vague shapes swirling around in the murk, though it might have been an optical illusion. I recoiled.\n\nI desperately wanted to be anywhere else right then, but the rest of the cabin was approaching a state a pandemonium. Flight attendants were hurrying up and down the aisles, attending to spills and bruises, even as they tripped and staggered. The entire plane was shuddering like a barrel going down the rapids. \n\nA series of jolts sent Molyneaux’s upper body swinging back and forth like an upside down pendulum. He was thrown backward into his seat, then sideways into me (a horrible feeling I will never forget), and then the opposite way, his face slamming directly into the window, where it came to rest.\n\nThat was enough for me. I unbuckled, leapt out of my seat and locked myself in the bathroom directly behind me. I would cower on a toilet for the rest of this hellish flight rather than spend another minute sitting with Mr. Molyneaux.\n\nThis plan worked for a half hour or so. I braced both my arms against the bathroom’s walls and listened to the chimes of flight attendant call buttons, the whine of jet engines and the growling of the sky. I tried to calm myself by visualizing the skyline of New York, the JFK air strip, a calm descent.\n\nBut then I imagined Molyneaux’s window, his face mashed up against the glass like a little boy’s, his dead eyes searching the night.\n\nThe captain’s disembodied voice called me back to reality. He sounded outright scared now, and the PA kept cutting in and out.\n\n“ … extremely anomalous weather … need everyone in their seats in the emergency position … immediately … if we depressurize … ”\n\nThe turbulence stopped for four or five seconds, and then suddenly it felt like I was inside a washing machine. I bounced against the walls of the bathroom, landed on the floor, and could barely manage to get the door open and crawl on all fours into the aisle.\n\nAll three flight attendants were down, sprawled on backs and bellies between the seats. Some of the overhead luggage bins had burst open and spewed baggage out. Many of the passengers were weeping. A few prayed. And through it all, the plane would not stop shaking.\n\nI heard a series of small bangs above my head and felt something wet on my cheek. Every single soda can in the galley had exploded. I climbed into my seat and belted myself in, having briefly forgotten about Molyneaux in my terror.\n\nTHWACK THWACK\n\nBut he was still in his seat of course, whipping back and forth like a flagpole in a hurricane, head-butting the window so hard that I could see the plexiglass balloon outwards and rebound each time. \n\nTHWACK\n\nI became worried he’d crack the window, though that’s supposed to be impossible, so I overcame my revulsion and grabbed his shoulders. But I couldn’t restrain him. \n\nAgain and again, his head hit the window. I began to fear that it was not simply the motion of the plane that compelled him. \n\nTHWACK THWACK THWACK\n\nNo one else on the plane was watching this. Some of the passengers had rallied and were trying to pull the injured flight attendants out of the aisle. Others were whispering goodbye messages into their phones.\n\nTHWACK THWACK KRKRRRRR\n\nI heard something crack beside me, and hoped desperately that it was Molyneaux’s skull, and not the window. Outside I could see that the green fog was alive with swirling, amorphous shapes.\n\nTHWACK KRKRRRR KRKOOM KRKOOM\n\nAnother explosion. Not pop cans this time, but pressurized oxygen escaping into sky. Molyneaux had managed to smash out both window panes in one, final blow. Now his mangled head was hanging outside the plane, and the rest of his body was straining to follow it, restrained only by his seatbelt and the width of his shoulders.\n\nAn alarm went off in the cabin, and a jungle of oxygen masks fell from the ceilings. I put mine on at once, but heard other people screaming. Some passengers were trying desperately to get masks on the unconscious air crew, but the plane was shaking more violently than ever, and loose debris was flying up the aisles toward my row — toward the hole a dead man had made in the airplane.\n\n“… cabin breach…” said the pilot. “… limited backup oxygen, so I’m trying to descend to a safe altitude … but hard to do that in this storm, or whatever it is … God be with us.”\n\nOnce I was sure that I could breath and was no in danger of being sucked out myself, I took one last look at Molyneaux. His head might have torn clean off outside the window, for all I could see of it past the rest of his body. \n\nI pictured those eyes again, which had seen something in the sky that we had not seen — could not see, even as it now threatened to shake the plane apart. There was some connection between these events that I might never understand. But even without understanding, I could make the last move available to me.\n\nI reached over Molyneaux’s lap, lifted one of those cold, clawed hands, and unclasped his seatbelt.\n\nThere was an intolerable crunching noise as, I presume, his shoulders were squeezed and crushed to fit the window frame. And then in a split second he was gone — out the window, into the night, a pale old man falling end over end toward the black ocean.\n\n“Whatever you saw out there,” I whispered. “Whatever you were looking for, go to it and leave us be.”\n\nThe green fog lifted a few minutes later, and the plane descended until it was safe to breath without the masks. Less than an hour later, I really did see the JFK airstrip. A whole squadron of police and ambulances met us on the way down. The flight attendants and several passengers had to be hospitalized, but as far as I know no one suffered serious injuries. \n\nFederal investigators eventually concluded that we had flown through a localized weather anomaly — witnessed by no other plane in the sky that night. Some sort of debris must have been flying around up there with us and taken out the window at 43-A, they wrote in their report: “This event led to a sudden loss of cabin pressure, in which the body of a passenger who had died earlier in an unrelated medical emergency was ejected from the plane.”  \n\nI expected to hear a lot more about it on the news, but I suppose in the end it was just one of those things. The airline had no interest in publicizing the incident, of course, and the passengers had no desire to relive it. \n\nFor most people on the flight, it was simply a freak tragedy followed by a close call, and all’s well that ends well. I’m the only one that will dream for the rest of my life about Molyneaux’s eyes, and what they saw on the way to the ocean."},"243":{"title":"The previous tenant of my new flat left a survival guide.

The lack of sleep is making me wonder whether all these things happening are in my mind or not. But I’m reminded every time I see that damn note that it’s all real. \n\nI spent hours last night searching for anything I could about Prudence Hemmings. If she had lived in a big creepy mansion I imagine she would have been easy to find. But us folk who live in tower blocks aren’t so well documented. No one cares about our lives, no matter how extraordinary.\n\nI found an article about missing person Lyla Hemmings. It suggested that she went missing under the care of her grandmother while playing in the park opposite the flats early in the morning. Interviews with her parents stated that they had both disowned Prudence. \n\nDespite the many years that had passed since Lyla’s death\/disappearance her parents appeared to have remained unforgiving of Prue. There was no mention of her on either of their social media accounts and she appeared to have no involvement with the children they had acquired since. \n\nSearches for the Hemmings family in the local area were equally dead ends, I looked at link after link, desperate to find something but they all started to blur into one. Until finally I saw something. \n\nAn obituary for Bernard “Bernie” Hemmings, who had fallen from the tower block in unexplained circumstances after being diagnosed with dementia months before his death. I was surprised it hadn’t made bigger news. It had only been about a year. There were no details of where to find them, but his wife Prudence and her sister Bridget were listed as contacts to get find out details of the funeral. \n\nIt’s scary what you can do with the internet these days, but just with those phone numbers I was able to put them into a reverse directory and find an address for Bridget and Tony Bishop, the sister and brother in law that Prudence was supposedly living with.\n\nAbout 4am I managed to get some sleep, not much though, I was back up and wide awake at around 7am, planning my route and working out my day. I saw a post on social media from one of her relatives that Georgia was identified and is stable. This loosened the knot in my stomach that has been present since I found the note somewhat. \n\nAt 8.50, I opened the door to my flat hoping to see postman Ian. 4 minutes passed and instead of the postman an elderly gentleman made his way down the corridor. He had a walking stick and kind eyes. In his free arm he carried a small plastic bag containing a newspaper and milk, he smiled and said “good morning” as he passed.\n\nI smiled back. He reminded me of my grandad. I imagined him pulling cola cubes from his pocket for his grandkids and shushing them when their parents weren’t looking. A little further down the corridor the old man stopped and turned. He looked me dead in the eyes with a sympathetic expression and spoke.\n\n“No post on a Sunday, if that’s what you were waiting for.” He smiled knowingly and turned to unlock a front door that until shut I couldn’t see the number of. When I saw the door close and the number 48 boldly displayed above the peephole I understood what Prudence had meant. Mr Prentice did seem to be a lovely chap. \n\nI sat back in my flat and sighed, staring at the various tabs open on my laptop. At about 9.15 the knocking on the balcony door started.\n\nThe window cleaner was back.\n\nI didn’t feel half as terrified as I had the first time, if anything, I was just angry. It took every ounce of restraint I had in my tired body not to engage with him, if only to tell him to fuck off. His genuine seeming requests just irritated me. After about 20 minutes of being watched the knocking started to give me a headache, so I grabbed a bag and left the flat.\n\nI decided there was no time like the present. If I was going to turn up on the Bishops’ doorstep looking for her sister because of the freaky flat she’s left behind then I had to get it over with. If the address was old, or the bishops weren’t the people I was looking for then I was going to look stupid whatever time of day I went.\n\nAnd I couldn’t take the window cleaners eyes anymore. There was something about them, they really do make you want to open that door. \n\nI looked at the lift as I entered the communal hallway and decided today I would take the stairs. I couldn’t stand to be in a small box that my partner probably died very painfully in. My heart dropped into my stomach just at the sight of it.\n\nThe stairs were as grotty as the lift. We’d taken them multiple times on move in day but I hadn’t really taken it in the same way I could now. I thought about the rules and all the strange things happening in this building. I looked at the badly painted numbers on the walls as I reached each landing.\n\nNothing in this building is simple.\n\nI looked at the numbers. 7, 6, 5 ... 5, 4, 3, 4, 2, G. Maybe it was the sleep deprivation but my legs were in agreement with my mind that I had definitely just descended more than 6 flights of stairs. They’d glitched. \n\nI looked at the dusty and poorly lit stairwell from the bottom. It seemed dark despite the sun pouring in from the glass panel in the main building doors. The note never mentioned glitchy stairs, maybe I really was losing my mind. \n\nAs I turned to exit the building a woman walked in. She was in her late thirties to early forties and had 2 small children in tow. One boy and one girl. I guessed that they were twins, they were both incredibly blonde, with deep brown puppy dog looking eyes and couldn’t have been any older than 6-7. They were as close to identical as it gets in twins of different genders. I’m not a fan of kids, but they were super cute. \n\nThe lady had a short bob haircut that got longer at the front, it was uniform and dyed a perfectly even auburn colour. I knew it was dyed because her roots were blonde like her kids. She looked as tired as I felt, but she pulled herself together when she saw me, running fingers through s part of her hair that she must have missed how ever early she left this morning. \n\n“Hi, are you here visiting?” Who opened with, trying to make small talk. \n\n“No, I just moved in to flat 42, on the 7th floor, I was just leaving actually. Whereabouts are you?” I was desperate to go, I had feared myself up to see Prue but I didn’t want to be rude.\n\n“I’m flat 26, my name’s Terri. This is Eddie and Ellie.” She gestured to the two small children hiding shyly behind her skirt. “Welcome to the block. If you ever need anything please feel free to give me a shout.”\n\n“My name is Katie but people call me Kat too. That’s really kind of you, thank you. I will.... hey, is there something wrong with the stairs?” I stopped myself before going into detail.\n\n“Nothing wrong, they just skip sometimes.” She answered, shrugging. \n\n“Well I’d love to stop and chat but I actually really need to get going. It was nice to meet you Terri.” I tried to work out what was wrong with the children as I stepped forward to walk away. Still baffled by the stairs.\n\n“By the way, we have a residents committee, you should come to one of our meetings, they’re every Tuesday in alternating flats. This Tuesday is at Molly Jefferson’s place in flat 31, come along. We’d love to have you!” Terri suggested, waving me off. \n\nI walked out the doors after my encounter with Terri feeling sick. Every minute in this place made the note more real. Every word jumped off the page and into my life. Made it more likely that Jamie was really gone. \n\nI rode the bus from a stop not far from the flats. It felt like it took and eternity to reach the little suburban area I was looking for. A five minute walk away from the bus stop I got off at and I was staring at a quaint little bungalow, belonging to Bridget and Tony Bishop. \n\nI knocked on the door. The lady who opened it was unsteady on her feet, she was probably in her 70s, with wispy white hair neatly scraped back into a bun, two strands left hanging that just softened her wrinkled face. She wore a dusty rose coloured dress that hung just below her knees and smelled of stale cigarette smoke. \n\n“Can I help you?” She asked bluntly.\n\n“My name is Kat. I’m looking for Prudence Hemmings.” I answered, stuttering slightly. \n\nHer eyes widened slightly.\n\n“Why?” She asked, bizarrely. \n\n“Is she here? It’s private.” \n\nThe lady ushered me into the house, and sat me down on a sofa, within minutes there was a cup of tea in front of me. She didn’t say anything to me for a while, we just looked at each other. Then she finally broke the silence. \n\n“I wondered if you’d try and find me. It took me a long time to decide whether to leave that note or not but I decided that you deserved a head start. That’s more than I ever got.”\n\nThe woman was Prudence, she was nothing like I had imagined. She seemed tough and hardened and spoke with a mostly blunt tone, she contributed before I could answer.\n\n“Terri called me not long ago. Told me that she had met the new tenant. She said you looked shaken up, and said that my note may not have been enough. I did say I couldn’t fit everything on there. And the stairs didn’t seem too important. The committee wanted to organise a meeting with you on your moving in day but I told them that was intrusive. The whole committee thing always seemed a bit excessive to me anyway.” She spoke flippantly, like it was nothing. \n\n“It may have been intrusive, but we needed a warning, we spent a night in the place before I found your note! My boyfriend had already left for work at 3.15 and taken the lift.... he didn’t know.” I broke as I told her what had happened. Her face dropped. And so did my hope for Jamie. \n\n“I’m so sorry... I really don’t know what to say. I thought my note would reach you in time.” She mumbled, her face to the floor, refusing to look at me as tears streamed down my face.\n\n“He’s gone isn’t he. I didn’t want to accept it but I spoke to the postman and your face says all it needs to. The postman said there might be a way I can have him back.” I bit at her, devastated and angry.\n\n“He’s gone. You can’t have him back. What Ian is referring to isn’t what you think. There’s a way to get people back from the lift. But not as themselves. Trust me, I learned the hard way. Once they’re back you can’t reverse it. I’m sorry about your man. But he’s gone forever. Don’t dig into the other way, to be gone forever is luckier than that alternative.” She still wouldn’t look up from the floor.\n\n“What do you mean...”\n\n“I don’t want to talk about it. I said in the note that there are things I’d rather not discuss and I need you to respect that or I won’t be speaking to you at all. Now move on and ask what you need to ask.” Prudence cut me off, I decided not to push the topic further, and moved on to some other things I needed to know.\n\n“What’s the deal with Terri’s kids? They seem sweet and normal.”\n\n“Those little demon creatures are anything but normal.” She answered, wincing slightly at the though of them. “When she went into labour Terri never made it to a hospital. They were the first children ever to be born inside the building and with everything that goes on it’s like something’s rubbed off on them. They’re average children in the daytime, but they never sleep, ever. Poor Terri hasn’t had a days rest since they were born. They also really love to steal birds and rats they find the cats playing with and torment them. Really annoys the cats.” \n\nAs she finished speaking a small hairless cat strutted out from behind an armchair across the room, meowing softly. It brushed its head up against Prue’s exposed legs, leaving scorch marks where it touched. She didn’t react, she reached down and stroked the top of its head, smiling as it purred. \n\n“And those?” I asked, eyes stuck to her now badly burned legs. \n\nShe chuckled, pulled out a box and lit a cigarette, tapping the top layer of ash into a small silver dish in front of her. She offered me one and I took it gladly. \n\n“They’ve always been my good friends. I couldn’t leave the building without bringing a part of home with me. This little guy is Damon. He’s seen some things.” She gushed, not taking her eyes off the cat. \n\n“But where did they come from, why are they everywhere?” I asked, watching in disbelief as her burns subsided. It seemed impossible, but I looked at my arms where I had picked up the cat the night before and there was no evidence it had ever happened. They didn’t even appear sunburnt. \n\n“No one really knows. They started to appear after the fire, a few years after I’d moved in. It was rumoured that they were the pets of the residents that burned, and that was why they had no fur. But I don’t think that’s true.”\n\nI interrupted.\n\n“I met one of those neighbours last night. She said her name was Natalia. She almost killed my best friend. You’re crazy if you think your note was enough of a warning!” I ranted emotionally.\n\n“Look, girl. If I had made a song and dance about warning you, then you’d have thought me crazy and challenged the rules. You’d have been dead already. Be grateful you got anything. I didn’t. I had to work it all out. Your generation are so spoiled.” She tutted in frustration at me. I was angry, but she was probably right. An elderly lady telling me rat like creatures would kill my boyfriend in a lift would probably have got some laughs from me a few days ago. I stayed quiet and waited for her to calm down, after a while she sighed and started again.\n\n“I think the cats are the neighbours that burned. They’ve never meant any harm and they hiss and run from the imposters that roam the building. Besides, there’s no way there were that many cats living on one floor. \n\nThe imposter people don’t even match up with the residents that died in the fire, none of them look like, or claim to have the same name as the dead. They just claim to live in their flats. I’ve met Natalia before, she left a bad scar on Bernie’s leg from an incident we had, nasty girl. \n\nBefore the fire there was cctv and there was a recording saved of about 15 people marching into the flats and up to that floor about half an hour before the fire started. It was the only evidence found. CCTV wasn’t great in the eighties so they were never identified. And the flames melted the relevant cameras so nothing ever came of it. \n\nI think the people that entered that night are the ones that ask for sugar. I don’t know any more than that but if you avoid them like I said you don’t need to know more. They hate the cats. I hope your friend survives, but I’ve seen what those people can do so maybe she was better off dead.” Prue carried on stroking Damon. I watched the skin of her fingers melt and twist as they made contact with him.\n\n“What happened to your husband?” \n\nI asked the question so fast I didn’t have time to consider that this was a topic she had explicitly said she didn’t want to discuss in the note. But I had to know. \n\nShe scowled at me. “I said I didn’t want to talk about that.” She hissed.\n\n“I just lost the love of my life. I need some answers.” I begged.\n\n“What happened to Bernie won’t help you. I know you’d think any deaths in that building would be down to the quirks but this wasn’t. For the most part anyway.\n\nDon’t forget that we had lived there for 35 years, Bernie knew the rules, we knew how to take care of ourselves and have a happy life there. It was our home.”\n\n“I don’t doubt that’s Mrs Hemmings, I’m sorry” I interjected.\n\n“Bernie had dementia. It started about 6 months before he died and he deteriorated very rapidly. Towards the end he started wandering, the doctors said it was common, but in our position it was incredibly dangerous. More times than I can count I pulled him away from the lift just in time.\n\nAlong with wandering he was forgetting the rules. He let that smug awful window cleaner in 3 times, thank lord for the big metal pipe I kept by the balcony door, chased him out a treat. Not that anything stops him from coming back. I’m sure you’re already acquainted. \n\nAfter all the dangerous situations Bernie was in, by the end he made the smallest and most fatal of errors. \n\nHe left a bowl of food out for Damon at 10am. I was out shopping with Terri and a few of the girls from the committee and when I came back I found one of those awful creatures...” \n\nPrudence started to cry. I put my hand on her shoulder in an attempt to comfort her, after all, I truly knew how she felt. \n\n“It was eating him.” She sniffed and steadied herself to continue, moving my hand. “I chased the creature away with the same metal pipe I had the window cleaner and pushed Bernie off the balcony. He was heavy but I didn’t want anyone to know what really killed him. It’s teeth..” she shivered “...they made such an awful noise. It reminded me of -“\n\n“Lyla.” I finished her sentence. I hadn’t meant to. I was so invested in her story I couldn’t help it. \n\n“I gather you spoke with Ian then.” She said sounding resigned. “I never meant to hurt that little girl. I loved her so much.” Tears rolled down her wrinkled cheeks. Damon, who was now sat next to her on the sofa, shuffled closer as if to cuddle her. \n\n“Haven’t you ever been curious about getting her back?” I asked, my mind turning back to the methods hinted at by both Prue and the postman. “I miss Jamie so much. I’d do anything to get him back.”\n\nHer face filled with a look of horror and shame. “Of course I have.” She answered, “which is exactly why I’m telling you not to.” \n\nBut I couldn’t let it go. \n\n“Surely anything must be better than gone forever?” I pestered. I wish I hadn’t.\n\nPrudence, frustrated, stood up and gestured for me to follow, she lead me outside to the back garden of the bungalow. At the back was a large shed, the kind people used for a man cave or a summer house. It was pretty, the sun shone down on it lighting up the few cobwebs in the corners and making them twinkle. \n\nMrs Hemmings was careful to look into both neighbouring gardens to ensure there was no one around before she unlocked the door to the shed. We stepped inside and the first thing to hit me was the smell, it was putrid, like rotting meat. I looked at the floor and covered my nose with my hands, staring back at me was a pool of blood.\n\nI followed the blood with my eyes as Prudence locked us in the shed. Then after I made it past the animal bones I finally saw it.\n\nJust like postman Ian had described.\n\nOne of the creatures was watching me, from a heavy duty metal dog cage in the corner of the shed. It looked reinforced but still the metal had chew marks. Their jaws had to be strong to cause that.\n\nThat didn’t surprise me looking at it, it’s rodent like nose and beady, yet somehow human like  eyes were nothing compared to the two very visible rows of jagged sharp teeth that lined each gum. Despite its small stature, it was terrifying. \n\nPrudence opened a drawer in a dusty cupboard across the room and pulled out a can of dog food, she poured the contents into the bowl  and passed the bowl through the feeding hatch. The cage had a safety feature meaning the animal couldn’t access the food until the hatch was locked from the outside. I was grateful for this.\n\nPrue turned to me and spoke. She brushed one of the two strands of hair framing her face behind her ear. Gesturing to the hideous creature she said;\n\n“Kat, I would like to introduce you to my granddaughter, Lyla.”\n\nHow the conversation went on : https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/cjintp\/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app"},"244":{"title":"I have an unusual job.

She didn’t flinch, which meant she thought I had a lot to offer. \n\nPretty little thing, she was. Nearly thirty years old, though I’d estimate the age of her modified chest to be about three. Her good looks stemmed mainly from the fact that she’d clearly avoided a lifetime of hard work. I probably would have been equally attractive twenty-five years ago had my twin passions been vanity and stupidity.\n\nThis gal was taken care of.\n\nHer expression glazed for just a moment. I noticed.\n\n“No,” she offered timidly, “it’s nothing like that.” She looked up at me with wide eyes that had been conditioned to elicit sympathy. I noticed. \n\n“It’s just…” she bit her lip. “It’s just that Raymond’s been gone a month – but I don’t think that he’s *gone* gone, you know? I want to know if I should put him behind me, or…” She shed a tear. “It started out small. His favorite sweater would be hanging in the closet, but the next morning, it was lying on the bedroom floor. Not a big deal, you know?” She looked around conspiratorially, despite the fact that no one was in the brightly lit sun porch besides the two of us. \n\nAs if sensing my thought, Sophocles rubbed up against my skirt. I reached down and scratched his ear without turning away from my client. She stared right back at me, looking over the swirling vapor dancing from the teapot’s spout. \n\n“But then,” she breathed, flushing slightly pink, “I would be, ah, in an intimate moment-”\n\n“Masturbating, or fucking?” I asked bluntly.\n\nHer pink face quickly turned crimson. “Um, the first one. I’d hear a sudden banging on my bedroom door. It would go away whenever I stopped… what I was doing.”\n\n“What makes you think it’s your dead husband?” I pressed her, crushing my cigarette and lighting a new one.\n\nShe gazed down at the table. “He would *always* interrupt me. Even if it wasn’t… about anything naughty.” She looked up at me in desperation. “It just *feels* like him. Does that make any sense?” She bit her lip again. I noticed. “But the worst thing was last night. That’s what made me decide that it was time to talk with a… *professional.*”\n\nGod, her little pauses and cute blushing were irritating. I really wanted to slap her. \n\n“Explain,” I ordered cavalierly before taking in that first drag.\n\nA long pull of the cigarette really makes people like her worth it. What was her name? Cindy? She seemed like a Cindy. But the Cindys of the world always scatter from my mind for *just* a few seconds during that first sensual puff. In those moments, I feel so *capable.*\n\n“Last night-”\n\nI coughed. Reality set back in. “Listen, Cindy-”\n\n“It’s Anne-Samantha.”\n\n“You must have jilled off thousands of times in your life-”\n\n“I’m sorry… ‘jilled’?”\n\n“Well, are you a Jack from the waist down?”\n\nShe laid a dainty little hand right on her mouth. “Oh… my, no. I’m all Jill, I suppose.”\n\nI grunted. “So what’s so different about jilling off now?”\n\nHer eyes got wide again, but I had learned long ago to suppress the slap-urge. “When I’m alone in bed, I hear breathing. *Only* when I’m alone. It’s unmistakable.”\n\n“Well, how hard are you working?” I asked pointedly.\n\nShe dropped the hand from her face. “The breathing is coming from the other side of the room.”\n\nI gave her an unblinking, fixed stare. She returned it.\n\nI finally turned away when a lump of ash fell from my cigarette onto the table. “Here,” I offered, pouring a cup of tea from the pot. I rested my hand on the painted grapefruit and lavender design to hold it steady. “Drink this.”\n\nShe took it obediently, blew on it, then took a sip and winced. “Too hot?” I asked sharply.\n\n“Too bitter,” she responded coolly.\n\n“Too bad,” I finished. “Drink the whole cup if you want to see what’s on the other side.”\n\nShe sipped as I spoke. “You’ve told me that Raymond’s been gone a month. You’re brokenhearted, but you can’t move on if he’s still here. The shock was terrible, wasn’t it? A hit-and-run while he was crossing the street right in front of your own home. The worst moments of your life were sprinting through the house, knowing what was outside before you saw it. The hope was the worst, because you *knew* that your husband’s broken body would be lying in the street. But the smallest part of you hoped that it wasn’t true, and that *hope* made it hurt so much more. You found him in a gory heap just beyond your front yard, and the future you’d imagined drained away like blood through your fingers. And it was in that exact moment, kneeling in the middle of the street at 7:13 p. m., that you realized your life had been permanently changed to a different path of someone else’s choosing.” I took an aggressive puff of the cigarette and pressed forward. “The sun set while you held his already-cooling hand, and you realized that this would be the first sunset you’d spend knowing he was dead, and that you would end every day with this thought on your mind from now on.”\n\nShe blanched. “I never told you that it was at sunset. I never even said it was a car accident.”\n\nI narrowed my eyes at her. “The guilt was more than you expected, because part of you had actually cared about Raymond. Yes, he was old, and *boring,* my God, you would never let him forget it. But he’d felt just so fucking fragile when you crushed his spine with the car that the anger didn’t seem to make sense in the moment.” I blew smoke through my nostrils. “He knew it was you, Cindy. You pulled the car into the driveway and rinsed off the blood so fast that no one even thought to check it for evidence. But *he* knew, and as he lay dying, unable to speak through shattered lungs, he stared at you without hate, malice, or vengeance. It was simple confusion, Cindy. Raymond never considered that you did it for the cash. His dying thought was wondering how he’d somehow been a bad husband, and he felt guilty for not knowing why.”\n\nHer eyes were shimmering with tears that I believed were genuine, but I didn’t give a shit.\n\nHer cup of tea was empty. \n\n“I was so careful,” she whispered in a pitch that was just below the ‘only dogs can hear it’ threshold. \n\nI rolled my eyes. “No you weren’t, Sweetie. People are just stupid, and that’s the only reason you’ve gotten away with everything so far. Really, putting $619,138 cash in a briefcase is just *asking* for trouble.”\n\nHer jaw hung in shock. “How could you possibly have known?”\n\nI blew one last long stream of smoke from the cigarette. “If I were in your shoes, Sweetie, I’d be much more worried about how much poisonous oleander you just had with your tea.”\n\nShe slammed her hands on the table and grabbed the edges so hard that the empty cup rattled in its saucer. *“What did you do to me?”* \n\nI pulled the cigarette butt from my lips and quashed it in her empty cup. “Make peace with whatever god or devil awaits your heart,” I answered flatly. Then I turned to look across the sun porch at the ghost only I could see.\n\nRaymond was a disgusting mess. His shattered spine had no hope of holding his torso rigid, so every limp limb flopped at unholy angles. A fountain of black blood oozed from his white lips and nose. His intestines protruded from his stomach like ground beef squeezed between grimy fingers, and the coils hung to the ground like sausage links.\n\nHe stared at his young widow. \n\nOr, I should say, the one eye that hadn’t popped to jelly was staring.\n\nI really think that Cindy would have been unnerved if she’d known he was there. \n\nInstead, she focused on me. “How long… when will it start?” She asked in utter petrification. \n\n“In just a second, Sweetie,” I quipped casually, lighting up another cigarette.\n\nRaymond grunted. He wasn’t much for talking, what with the lolling tongue dangling impotently where his missing jaw should have been.\n\n“Oh, and one last thing, Sugar.” I leaned forward and gently rested my palms on the tabletop. “Raymond wants to let you know that dying really, *really* fucking hurts.” \n\nShe froze. Behind her, despite lacking a mouth, I could swear that Raymond was smiling.\n\nThe convulsing started then, but it didn’t stop for a long time. \n\nDo you have any idea how far mouth foam can spray when a dying woman just won’t stop thrashing?\n\nI almost felt bad for her when I realized how hard she was trying to cry. \n\nThat’s a really fucking difficult task, though, when your throat is closing up. \n\nThat’s when Raymond sauntered over to her jittering body, knelt down, and gently grazed his dead fingertips across her cheek. He looked passionately into her eyes, and for just a moment, I think she looked back.\n\nThen she was gone. \n\nThe ghost-corpse took in the sight for a few moments before I interrupted him with a forced clearing of my throat.\n\n“A-*hem.*” He glanced up at me with his lone functioning eye. It was damp. “I *do* appreciate your clear instructions on how to locate the briefcase. If everything is as promised, the bill will be settled.”\n\nHe grunted and waved his limp, floppy arm at the body of his dead wife. \n\n“Her? I’ll leave her in the backyard of your house. I snuck an oleander plant into the garden during one of my nightly visits. They’re not uncommon here in Alabama, and they will explain her ‘accidental’ death nicely.” I wrinkled my nose. “And I have to say, I’ll be grateful to stop sneaking into your house each night to spook this murderous little witch. Her masturbatory moans made me gag, and I hate crawling through windows. I’m not fifty anymore, you know.” I took in a deep breath of nicotine-laced air.\n\nHe grunted again, dangling his unresponsive arm above the dead woman once more. \n\n“Hmmm?” I asked in genuine curiosity as I approached the corpse. “There’s something more?”\n\nHe shook more eagerly, spraying a fine mist of ghost blood onto the woman’s purple face. \n\n“Oh, my,” I whispered.\n\nI bent down and pried a ring from the woman’s rubbery hand. \n\n“There must be two dozen diamonds on this!” I sang. Then I slipped it onto my middle finger.\n\nIt fit perfectly. \n\n“Yes, thank you very much, I *do* accept tips for a job well done, you gentleman, you.”\n\nThis time I *know* Raymond was smiling.\n\nAnd I was, too.\n\nMy name is Patricia Barnes, and I’m a hitman for ghosts that [only I can see](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462\/).\n\n[BD](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ByfelsDisciple\/)\n\n-----\n\n[What happened next](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/b59hoa\/im_patricia_barnes_hitman_for_ghosts_that_only_i\/?)"},"245":{"title":"I found a disturbing yoga stream.

Tucked between the kickboxing classes and the home-gym meatheads was her thumbnail.\n\nIt caught my eye. It was a simple shot of her face, so near to the camera that I could count the freckles. Her teeth a little too large for her mouth and her nose ever so slightly crooked.\n\nI’ve never been the type of guy to consider yoga, but I tuned in, and in a matter of seconds, I was entranced.\n\nThe girl was in her living room, a haphazard mise-en-scene – the floor speckled with sad little plants and stacks of magazines. She posed with her hands on the floor and her hips thrust in the air. Her butt perched in the center of the screen.\n\nI decided to stay a while.\n\nI had no yoga mat, so I laid out a towel. It was difficult to follow along – she talked, a *lot*, and only a fraction of it was about the routine. “Press your heels together and bend your head to your feet, breathing deeply. My feet smell like peaches and cream today. Makes me want to gobble them up. I love summer peaches, I love biting into them and feeling the juice erupt in my mouth, it reminds me of the time when – ”\n\nAnd I fell into the meditative quagmire woven by her words, inhaling the scent of my own socks, failing to notice she’d moved into a different pose.\n\nAfter a while, my muscles trembled with the effort of supporting my soft body in these unfamiliar positions, so I called it a day. It was then that I noticed it.\n\n*Subscribers: 1*\n\nThat was me. I was the only one watching. I felt an inexplicable flood of guilt when I closed the browser, like I was abandoning her.\n\nI checked back into her channel the next few afternoons. It was the strangest thing. She was *always* streaming. She was either unaware of my presence, or apathetic to it. Her ramblings, so freewheeling that they approached random word association, didn’t seem to change whether I was there or not – she was often mid-sentence when I logged in. She was flirty in a way that made it clear she wasn’t trying to be, charmingly raw in her tendency to fumble instructions.\n\nCuriosity overwhelmed me. I yearned to discover more about this fascinating creature. Her movements drew me in, like she was grasping at me through the screen. I marveled at the feeling of being her silent voyeur.\n\nI developed more comfort with the basic poses, though I still couldn’t get my hands anywhere near my toes. Too soon, she notched up the level of difficulty. She eased herself into the splits. Each leg outstretched, her toes pointed at perfect right angles. I tried my best to replicate the pose, my groin protesting the pressure. Each day, she pushed a little farther. She curved her spine sharply behind her, a graceful arc. She lifted her back leg high into the air at an angle that seemed to wrench her hip out of place.\n\nI forced my body into the closest approximations of her geometry that my tendons would allow, my teeth gritted against the sharp warnings issued by my nerves. At night I dreamed that she was breaking my joints, cracking my limbs into the clean shapes that she maintained so effortlessly.\n\nOne day she twisted her arms so far behind her that I felt sympathetic pain, and folded herself up so that her bent legs swooped around her shoulders, touching her toes behind her neck. She smiled at the camera, demurely, politely. “You want to see me bend into a pretzel, don’t you?” she asked.\n\nThat was the first time she addressed me.\n\nI would forget to eat. I’d wake up on the couch, having dozed off, and she would be murmuring about pomegranates while her forehead brushed her knees. Did she sleep? Did she eat? I saw no evidence of it.\n\nEvery time I moved, my body ached with the memory of being stretched to its limit. I was spending ten, twelve, fourteen hours a day on her stream. She spoke to me frequently. “I know you’ve been watching me. I think you like watching me. How far do you want me to twist for you?”\n\nThe fluid shifting of her body into vertices and curves and delicate polygons was hypnotizing. I was getting lost in the light of a flickering flame as it swirled into different patterns. I was working myself into something more pliable, molding myself into something like her image.\n\nIt's difficult to pinpoint the moment she went too far. It was more like the creep of quicksand than any one single point.\n\nShe would lie on her back and lift herself on the palms and soles of her feet, her torso thrusting at the ceiling like she was something from the Exorcist. She would inch her hands and feet closer together, folding her body backwards on itself until she was nearly split in half. And then she would skitter forward until the whites of her eyes flooded the screen, scaring me so much that I jumped. And she would laugh, as if she had made a joke.\n\nShe would twist her head around like an owl, and thrust it between her thighs. Always blinking at the screen. Always smiling like we were sharing some inside secret, like I was in on the sly conspiracy.\n\nShe said, “You like this, don’t you, Mr. Smith? Am I your foldable pocket toy?”\n\nSmith is a very common last name. There was a nonzero chance she’d just guessed correctly. But this freaked me out enough to slam the laptop shut, shattering the image of her toothy smile.\n\nI tried to resume normal life. But I had almost nothing to fill my time except television and social media and filling out applications for jobs I’d never want to work. A strange sensation tickled at me, like something was wrong, like I was forgetting something. And powerful waves of guilt, the same guilt I’d felt when I closed her stream the first day I’d found her.\n\nI tried not to. I really, really tried to stay away. But the urge overwhelmed me, so I returned.\n\nFor the first time, she wasn’t onscreen when I logged in. I peered closer at the scene, seeing the familiar yoga mat on the ground, the coffee table, the magazines. There was a soft noise coming from just off-screen, a muffled noise, irregular and halting. A human voice. I turned the volume all the way up, and I couldn’t tell if it was laughter or crying.\n\nFeeling sick, I closed the stream.\n\nThis brings us to yesterday.\n\nI had spent countless hours thinking about her, wondering what she was doing, whether she was still telling stories to her invisible visitor. I logged in.\n\nHer eyes filled the webcam’s field of vision, so suddenly that I scrambled backwards. And that sound – echoing around the walls of her apartment and mine, and it was now clear that it was a sound of misery.\n\nHer moan was wordless, and as her face backed away, I saw why. Her bare foot was stuffed halfway in her mouth, her jaw nearly unhinged to accommodate it, the ball wedged between her teeth. Tears were streaming down her face, pooling around the corners of her stretched lips.\n\nHer arms were folded behind her head and her other leg was tucked under the first. She was struggling, and I realized that she was stuck.\n\nShe was trapped in that position, a twisted ball of limbs and strained joints, unable to speak.\n\nI stared slackjawed at the screen, and her eyes met mine, seeming to blink in recognition. The force of her sobs crescendoed. In relief? I wasn’t sure.\n\nI had no idea what to do. I didn’t know her name or where she lived – I didn’t even know for sure that she was in the same country. I sat, frozen, for long moments, watching the twitching of her limbs as she tried to wrench herself out of the cage her body made. Then it struck me: I could type.\n\n*Can you type your address?*\n\nThe messaged pinged its arrival at her computer. Our first real communication.\n\nShe shook her head almost imperceptibly, with the slight range of motion her position allowed.\n\nI tried again: *Can you type with your nose?*\n\nHer eyes flickered across the page as she read my words. With great effort she rocked herself over, landing face-first on the keyboard. *sivioshgeusoh*, she typed.\n\nMy heart pounding, I said, *try again*.\n\nI watched as she managed to prop herself precariously on one shoulder. Her body was convulsing with the force of her sobs. Eventually, she leaned forward, carefully, delicately, and pressed the tip of her nose to the keys. *3*.\n\nYes! That was it! *That’s great. Give me another number.*\n\nWe traded for long, suspenseful minutes, her giving me one number or letter at a time, me writing them down and encouraging her as best I could. *You’re doing great. I’m here with you. Help is on the way.*\n\nShe had cobbled together a number and a street. It had taken us nearly an hour to get to this point. She had just finished typing *apt12* when she stopped, trembling with the effort of keeping herself upright, and we met eyes again through the camera, hers shining with pain and fear. And then she collapsed.\n\nShe rolled out of sight. Panicking, I sent her dozens of frantic messages: *What city? What state? Stay with me. I’m here. Where are you? I need more.*\n\nIt became clear that no more was coming. Her sobs stilled, her breath quieted.\n\nI searched the address and found every city in the country where the address she’d given me existed. I called every police station in every jurisdiction within range. It took a *lot* of explanation, but after hours of work there was nothing I could do but sit and wait nervously by the phone and stare at the empty apartment framed within my laptop screen.\n\nAll I could do was type.\n\n*I’m here with you.*\n\n*You’ll be safe.*\n\n*This will be over soon.*\n\n*You’re not alone.*\n\nThe ringing of the phone nearly sent me out of my skin. It was one in the morning.\n\n“Did you find her?” I asked desperately, scanning the scene for any sign of activity. “Tell me she’s all right!”\n\nThe voice on the other end of the line sighed, a deep sigh, of sadness or frustration I couldn’t say. “We found her,” he said, his words gentle but guarded. “Stuck in that position, as you described. She’s… she’s not okay. She died of dehydration.”\n\n“She – what? No. That’s not possible. I just spoke to her!”\n\n“I don’t know what you saw, son. I truly don’t. But the girl we found has been dead for a month.”\n\n[*x*](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relicularity\/)"},"246":{"title":"Because You Are My Baby","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/ai41d3\/because_you_are_my_baby\/","flair":null,"author":"Dopabeane","selftext":"My mother had the most beautiful teeth.\n\nHer teeth are my first memory. I remember them: long and white and bared in a ferocious grin, shining under the full moon as she told me a story. Not a fairy tale or picture book, but *my* the story. The story of how I’d come to her…or rather, how she’d come to me. \n\nWhen I was very small – too small to remember anything at all – my mother stole me from a man, and took me to live in the forest.  She stole me not as an act of love, but as an act of revenge. Though I was desperate to know, she never told me what needed revenging.\n\nOne night, I finally asked, “Why won’t you tell me?”\n\n“Because you are my baby,” she whispered in her low, wet voice. She stroked my face with long fingers. Her teeth glittered under the stars, rich and pale as polished ivory. “My baby will never hear, or see, or know the cruelties that haunt me.” \n\nCruelty was not the only thing my mother knew that I did not, although it *was* the only thing she refused to teach me. My mother tried very hard to teach me everything else she knew. Unfortunately, I was a very poor pupil indeed.\n\nMy mother was a remarkable huntress. She felled elk and bear effortlessly. Sometimes she slid into the lake without so much as a ripple, and returned hours later with a monstrous fish clamped in her jaws.\n\nBecause hunting came so easily to her, Mother expected me to learn quickly. “Men hunt,” she hissed. “They have always hunted. So shall you.”\n\nBut I could not hunt. Not like her. My small, soft fingers were no match for her lethal claws. My clumsy little body – somehow so susceptible to both the heat and the cold – trailed after her whiplike predator’s form. Mother caught deer and foxes with her beautiful teeth, striking from the shadows like a snake. By contrast, my dull teeth could not even crush rabbit bones.\n\nI persevered, but did not improve. One night, while Mother snaked through the shadows, communing with trees and evading the dark things prowling the night, I curled up and wept. \n\nShe found me that way, weak and weeping. I covered my eyes and held my breath. I knew it was useless – Mother could hear my heartbeat from the other side of the hill, so she surely knew I was crying – but that small scrap of pride was all I had.\n\nMother stood there for a long while. Then she crept forward and covered me with fresh leaves before lying beside me. “I will feed you, always,” she whispered. “Because you are my baby.”\n\nIn addition to hunting, my mother was a phenomenal creator of shelters. Sometimes she lived within the earth, snaking through loam and tree roots like treasure-hoarding dragons of old.\n\nSometimes she lived in the trees. Many nights I watched in awe as her bones elongated and tore through her rough skin, stretching upward to twist among the branches like an ancient spider god. I would wait patiently, sometimes for hours, as Mother communed with the spirits buried in the roots.\n\nAnd sometimes she lived in the shadows, creeping through the darkness to flush out food and threat alike. \n\nSo, Mother tried to teach me to dig burrows. But I could not dig like her. I was too small and too soft, and far too frightened of the bugs and moles that tunneled through the earth.\n\nSo she tried to teach me to live among the tree branches, to rest and listen as the redwoods murmured the long, strange histories of the earth. But my bones could not stretch like Mother’s. I could not twist my arms to match the branches. My skin could not interlock with the treebark, and my blood was too sluggish to melt into the sap.\n\nSo Mother tried to teach me to live in the shadows. But the darkness terrified me. Every night, I hid and wept, imagining the legs of centipedes crawling across my skin. All the night creatures reveled in my fear; owls swooped down to taunt me and bats torpedoed toward me, giggling in their shrill, squeaking voices until mother slapped them out of the sky.\n\nFinally Mother realized the futility of these lessons. So she dug a deep burrow just for me. She lined it with leaves and slurped the worms and roaches from the walls. When she finished, I burst into tears.\n\n“Why do you weep?” she rasped.\n\n“Because you do everything for me.” I knew the laws of nature. I knew the laws of forest creatures and their young. Young that were weak were killed in the nest. Young that could not learn to fend for themselves were abandoned to die. I was weak and soft and coated in terrible, ugly scars. “Why do you do everything for me?”\n\nMother snaked forward, long, large hands sinking into the earth. She curled around me and pulled me close. “Because you are my baby.”\n\nMother did not always live in the burrow with me. She roamed the mountains. She burrowed with moles, slithered with snakes, grazed with elk, hunted with wolves, stood with trees. \n\nWhen I was very small, I thought she ate the forest. But it was not that simple; she protected it, and in return it sustained her. “My heart,” she told me one rainy night, “is the forest, so this is how it must be.”\n\nAs I grew older, I developed rudimentary survival skills. I shied away from hunting big game – elk and deer, bears and boar – because I did not protect the forest. I gave it nothing; I only took, so I took as little as I could. I trapped rabbits, fished the streams, and ate wild berries. I dared take nothing else.\n\nOnce I could reliably feed myself, Mother stayed away for long stretches. Hours, then days, and finally weeks. I missed her terribly, with a deep, panicky ache.\n\nI confronted her about it one balmy spring evening. “You leave me more and more,” I accused. “Soon you’ll leave me forever.”\n\n“Never,” she murmured. A breeze twined around us, raising gooseflesh on my skin and rippling her long white hair. “I will never leave you.”\n\n“But you do!” I screamed. “You already do!”\n\n“Before you came, I lived among the trees, listening to their warnings. I slept in the warm earth as worms and centipedes nibbled my skin. I spent many of your lifetimes within the forest, little one – so many lives at a time that I forgot my own name. I do not leave you. I have left the forest for you.”\n\n“I didn’t come here,” I sobbed. “You took me!”\n\n“I did,” she said. “So I will never leave you. When you think I’ve left, silence yourself and listen. Listen for me the way I listen for the trees, the animals, and the stars. If you are silent and you are sincere, you will hear me.”\n\nAnd then she left.\n\nFury and jealousy seared my heart like a wildfire. She insulted me, she humiliated me, and after all that she *left* me. Left me for the centipedes and the wolves and the stupid, chittering bats.\n\n“I don’t need you!” I screamed. An owl hooted angrily in response. “I don’t need you at all!”\n\nThen I ran for my burrow. As it the earthen door materialized before me, nodding with flowers and wild grasses, anger swelled inside me. It possessed me, this wild ball of misery borne of my own endless fear and inadequacy. And it spoke to me.\n*Why should you return to the burrow?* it asked. Why indeed? It wasn’t mine. It was Mother’s. The entire forest belonged to Mother. Without her, the forest would have consumed me long ago.\n\nSo I turned away from the burrow and kept running. *I will find the end of the forest,* I decided. *I will leave it once and for all.*\n\nI ran for days, in the process treating the forest with contempt. I stripped the trees of their leaves to make nightly beds. I threw rocks at birds and rabbits. I uprooted bushes and stripped entire groves of their berries, eating until I threw up from sheer excess. Then I ate again. Not out of hunger, not out of any need, but out of malice.\n\nAnd one day – long after spring ceded to summer in a verdant explosion of heat and greenery – I heard voices.\n\nI froze immediately. The only voice I knew was Mother’s – wet and low, an earthy, rib-shaking whisper. These voices were nothing like Mother’s. They were high and somehow infantile, with strange, shrill notes.\n\nThese voices…they were like *mine.*\n\nTrembling, I dropped low and crept through the underbrush. Sun-warmed leaves brushed against my face, smooth but painfully crisp; the sun was taking its toll on them. I snaked over the ground, pretending I was Mother, slipping through the forest like an invisible snake.\n\nI reached a break in the trees and peered through.\n\nIn a small clearing were four creatures. They had pink skin and wore heavy clothing that looked suffocating. There hands were small and soft. Their faces were smooth and babylike, somehow half-formed: wide eyed and rounded, with soft noses and plump flesh.\n\nI touched my face – flat and smooth - and looked down at myself: mudstreaked, deeply tanned, and marked with a hideous mass of scars, but still *soft.* Hairless, small, weak. There was no mistaking it. These things in the woods – these overdressed, half-formed beings with small teeth and no claws and overlarge eyes – were like me.\n\nThey were men.\n\nI stood up, propelled by panicky excitement, and strode forward. All at once, they froze.\n\n“What the hell?” one whispered. He lifted something in his arms and pointed it at me. It was long and strange to me. Inorganic, not alive, with a wooden handle and a gleaming tube.\n\nJust then, I realized something: the forest was silent. A few birds chirped and sang, and a few bugs emitted their persistent drone. But the vast majority – birds, insects, trees – were silent. No rabbits, no deer, certainly no bears. These things – these creatures like me, these *men* - had silenced the earth.\n\nThey’d stolen the forest from itself. \n\nWe stared at each other for a long time as ever-growing summer heat filled the clearing like an invisible pool.\n\n“Mother,” I whispered. “Mother, please help me.”\n\nShe did not. So I turned and ran.\n\nThe men immediately pursued. I could hear them: yelling, crushing the undergrowth, stamping on blossoms and bugs, snapping branches as they ran. The forest’s deathly silence was worse than any cry.\n\n“There it is!” one of them screamed. A second later, the forest exploded: a deafening *boom* shook the trees and ate through the air as pain erupted on my shoulder. I didn’t dare stop or look. I pressed on, running and crying as the men came after me.\n\nThe forest seemed to punish me for my earlier cruelty. Brambles scratched my legs. Stones cut my feet. Branches swiped at my face, leaving deep, stinging runnels. I thanked the forest for its kindness. I thanked it for punishing me, rather than stopping me. \n\nThe men gasped and wailed amongst themselves. “What the hell is it?” “I don’t know. *I don’t know!*” “Is it a…a kid?” “Look at its face. Look at its fucking face! That isn’t a kid!”\n\nSomething suddenly filled my ears, drowning the sounds of the men and the forest. A deep, musical rushing, like birdsong transformed into a turbulent river.\n\nAnd then Mother came, erupting from the trees like a great beast of old. But that’s what she was, after all. A great beast, surely a daemon of the ancient world.\n\nShe pounced upon the men, batting them the way a housecat bats its toys. She clamped one between her claws, squeezing until his head separated and went rolling across the ground.\n\nOne by one Mother caught and tore them, shredding them the way she shredded leaves for my bedding. Blood streaked the forest, turning the dirt to mud and dripping from the trees like sluggish rain. \n\nMother dug her claws into the skull of the last survivor and cracked it open like a fruit. Blood and grey brain glistened in the sunlight. The man screamed, and screamed, and screamed.\n\nMother leaned down and extended her tongue. It curled outward, pale and orange-gold like sunrise on a cold, clear morning, and delicately slurped his brains. Curl by curl, like so many worms from my burrow walls.\n\nBy the time he stopped screaming, the forest had returned to its loud, familiar glory: murmuring trees, singing birds, skittering insects, grazing deer. \n\nI smiled and ran to Mother. She reared up and screamed, “*See what you’ve done!*”\n\nTerror paralyzed me. I looked helplessly at her – blazing eyes, contorted face runneled with earth and wildflowers, sunbleached bone and pale, spongy rot. My mother, my beautiful daemon mother who claimed me out of revenge and raised me out of obligation, staring at me like I was a man.\n\n“When you stone a bird, my heart stops! When you break a branch, my bones snap! When you selfishly strip the shrubs of their fruit, of their very birthright, my skin blisters! When you hurt the forest,” she roared, “*my heart bleeds!*”\n\nI fell to my knees and hid my face. Mother rushed forward on her many limbs and wrapped long fingers around my throat. She lifted me up, dangling me over the forest floor. “I killed men for you! Now more will come! They will trample! They will cut! They will burn! They will kill! They will kill the bears and the cougars and the wolves, for they will blame the predators for what I have done for you! Do you see?” She shook me. The carnage below seemed to swing beneath me, a tapestry of blood-soaked earth and ruined corpses. “*Do you see?*”\n\n“Yes, Mother,” I whispered. “I see.”\n\nShe dropped me. I hit the ground with such force it knocked the wind out of me. Mother pulled back and busied herself with one of the corpses. I looked up, shaking. Birds watched from the trees, quick and curious and full of condemnation. I averted my eyes as tears spilled.\n\nMother returned to me. She extended an arm and opened her hand. Upon her large palm were four eyes and a large, glistening heart. I stared at them blankly, then looked up at her.\n\n“Four eyes,” she said. “One from each man. And the heart of the one that shot you. Eat.”\n\nMy lip quivered. I couldn’t tear my eyes away from the gore in my mother’s hand. A heart and eyes. Raw and plump, alive just minutes ago.\n\n“Mother,” I said. “Please.”\n\n“Are you of me?” she asked. “Or are you of man?”\n\nThe forest became painfully silent. The animals, the trees, and the insects, all waiting with bated breath.\n\n“I am of you, Mother.” I plucked the first eye from her palm. It was round and curiously firm, with a sort of firm, watery texture I associated with half-rotten fruits. The pink, wormy optic nerve dangled. For a terrible moment I thought I would vomit.\n\nThen I raised it to my lips and bit in.\n\nThe eyes were awful, the heart even worse: thick and almost impossible to chew. Mother had to tear it for me, slicing it into manageable pieces with her beautiful teeth. \n\nWhen I finished, Mother picked me up and, holding me tightly, streaked back to the burrow as night fell.\n\nThat night, I became ill. I shook and shivered and hallucinated for days. My mind bled with images of dangling eyes and glistening hearts and skulls cracked apart like pomegranates. Mother lay with my all the while, soothing me with ancient songs like birdsong turned to rivers, and cooling me with her damp, earthy breath.\n\nFinally the fever broke. I sat up, gasping as the last vestiges of my nightmare drifted away.\n\nMother sat across the burrow, hunched over tiredly. “You are well,” she said. “I am glad, for I must leave.”\n\nI blinked tiredly. “Why?”\n\n“Men,” she said. \n\n“But you killed them.”\n\n“There are more,” she said. “They creep into the forest, searching for their dead brethren. They are cutting the trees and crushing the flowers and killing the bears, my little one. If I don’t stop them, they will even come for you. I have to stop them. My heart is the forest, and so are you. I must protect both.”\n\nA lump rose in my throat. Shame like I’d never known enveloped me. “I’m so sorry.”\n\n“You are my baby. Babies must learn. By learning, they grow.”\n\n“Mother,” I said. “Am I truly of man?”\n\nMother closed her eyes. For a long time, she did not speak. Then she drew a deep breath. “I took you from a cruel man. Listen. I will tell you now of the cruelties I endured.”\n\nI listened, enraptured and horrified, as she spun her sorry tale.\n\nMother was once a young, beautiful human woman.\n\n“Surely not more beautiful than you are now,” I objected.\n\n“Listen!” she said.\n\nMother was alone in the world. She had no family or friends. She once had a family, but they harmed her greatly so she ran away. She lived in the forest, in a small, ragged tent. She ate wild berries, fished the lake, and boiled water to drink.\n\nLaws are strange things. Though Mother hurt nothing and no one, she was breaking the law by living in the forest. She was found, and caught, and imprisoned. Separated from the trees and the birds, Mother faded quickly. Though she was only jailed for a short while, it nearly killed her. The day she was released was the best day of her life…\n\nOr so she thought.\n\nNo sooner had Mother gathered her meager belongings and exited the jail than a guard came up beside her. “Where are you headed to?” he asked. “I’ll take you wherever you want to go.”\n\nMother was ecstatic. “Take me back to the forest,” she said. The guard obliged, driving her toward the woods. Except he stopped too soon. He stopped at a house. His house, it turned out.\n\nThe guard was a terrible man. He trapped Mother. He hurt her, tortured her, abused her in every way. He cut her open, he burned her, he snapped her bones. \n\nAnd he put a baby in her. Mother was so broken that he missed all signs of impending childbirth. When I came, Mother died.\n\n“He dumped me in a vat of acid,” Mother told me, “and scattered my liquid remains among the trees. But then I heard you.” Mother smiled faintly. Crumbles of dirt and root fell from her face. “I heard your cry. Your need for me.”\n\nI do not understand what Mother said next; it is difficult to translate. But the closest I can come is this. Everyone sings a song to those they love. Most aren’t able to hear these songs. If you can’t hear, it can’t help you. But if you can hear it, a song is the most powerful thing in the world. It kills. It calls. It consumes. It destroys. It strengthens.\n\nAnd sometimes, it resurrects.\n\n“When I reformed and breathed again, I stole you from your father,” Mother said. “Then I brought you here, because you are my baby.”\n\nI wept silently, because I didn’t know what to say.\n\n“I must go,” she said. “The trees and the animals need me now. So remember, little one. When you are silent and you are sincere, you will hear me.”\n\nThen she whipped around – like a wolf, a snake, and hawk combined – and left.\n\nShe did not return.\n\nAt first, I thought nothing of it. I had made a terrible mess; I had summoned men. I had caused the forest to bleed. Mother had a great deal of work ahead of her.\n\nBut summer slowly bled into fall, and still Mother did not return. When the first snow came – dry and cold, skittering across the landscape like powder – I knew something was wrong.\n\nThe snows deepened. The forest drifted into its winter sleep, cloaked in ice and fog. Every night, I made myself silent. I mustered all the sincerity I could. And I listened for my mother’s voice.\n\nIt didn’t come.\n\nI grew thin and sick. My skin burned even as I shivered. My chest grew congested, my throat so sore I couldn’t sleep. My breath came in sharp, pained wheezes.  Soon I became too weak to leave the burrow. I crawled to the doorway and ate snow. For sustenance, I slurped worms from the earthen walls. \n\nIt was not enough, and I knew it.\n\nOnly then – in the quiet and peace and fear of approaching death – did I become truly silent. Only then did I hear the voice of my mother.\n\nI heard her in my dreams: the low, rushing voice like music made into water. *I am coming,* she said. *I am coming, because you are my baby.*\n\nI smiled, and slept. \n\nNext thing I knew, I was cold. Cold and wet and shivering, but *awake.*I shot up and screamed as my skin brushed the thick, flower-matted hide of my mother. I spun around, smiling, and froze.\n\nMother lay beside me, panting. Blood seeped from a hundred wounds, crusting her hair. The exposed bones in her face were crushed and concave, leaking gore and blood. Without opening her eyes, she smiled. “I heard you. I heard your song.”\n\nTears blurred my vision. My chest began to hitch. I couldn’t draw breath; it was like I was sick again, drowning in pus and trapped fluid. Only I wasn’t dying this time.\n\nMy mother was.\n\n“Then stay,” I said. “You have to stay, because you can hear my song.”\n\n“No,” she said. “You needed to see me again. But you do not need me.”\n\n“I need you. Mama, *I need you.*”\n\n“No,” she said. “I killed all who would harm you.”\n\n“But what about the forest? The forest will kill me without you!”\n\nShe chuckled. Her breath came, terribly fast and increasingly weak. “You are of me. Remember. You are of me. You are my baby.”\n\nMy mother – my beautiful, ancient mother – drew a shallow breath, and lay still.\n\nI lay beside her for many days. Then, when she began to stink, I left. A hiker eventually found me. A stupid, solitary hiker with a soft heart, a great deal of patience, and no fear.\n\nWhen I learned to speak the words of men, the authorities lost no time in telling me that Mother was not really my mother. \n\nThey discovered my identity (at least in a manner of speaking) through DNA. My real mother, they say, was a vagrant. A Jane Doe who lived in a tent in the national park. She was alone and defenseless, two things that attract human monsters. After a brief stint in jail for loitering, my mother ended up kidnapped, imprisoned, and tortured by an as-yet unidentified assailant who eventually tried unsuccessfully to dissolve her in acid. They think he attempted to dissolve my body, too. That’s why I am covered in scars. It is why I frightened those hunters so long ago: the acid burns make me look like a monster to men.\n\nSince my real mother apparently died long ago, they decided that Mother – whoever she was – was nothing but a crazy, homeless child abuser.\n\nBut I know better.\n\nEven so, I adapted. I had no choice. I am of my mother, but I live among men. That’s what animals must do; their young learn, grow, and adapt. If they don’t, they die. \n\nBut I am not adapting anymore. At least, I am not adapting to live among men. My mouth is changing. Changing in ways that are terrible to people, but wonderful to me. It’s my teeth, you see.\n\nI am growing my mother’s beautiful teeth.\n\nLooking at my teeth in the mirror was frightening and electrifying. Joy and terror ran through my veins in equal measure. It had to mean something. So I fell silent. I became sincere. I listened.\n\nAnd I heard.\n\nI heard the voice of my mother: low and rushing, like birdsong turned to a wild river. She tells me I do not belong with men, because I am her heart, and her heart is the forest. She tells me I must return.\n\nAnd she tells me she is waiting for me, because I am her baby.\n"},"247":{"title":"My job is watching a woman trapped in a room. Final Part.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/bue2kk\/my_job_is_watching_a_woman_trapped_in_a_room\/","flair":null,"author":"Verastahl","selftext":"[Part One](https:\/\/redd.it\/brco33)\n**** \n[Part Two](https:\/\/redd.it\/brsj8v)\n**** \n[Part Three](https:\/\/redd.it\/bsg2az)\n**** \n[Part Four](https:\/\/redd.it\/btkvkl)\n**** \n\n\nI spent the next five days watching Rachel die.\n\nFrom the outside, just watching the monitor, it didn’t seem that different than what I had been watching for the past three years.  Rachel slept, she watched T.V., she read, and she painted.  But there were signs if you were looking for them.  She seemed tired and tense, and she had taken to sleeping more.  And occasionally, just every once in a while, she would glance up at the camera—at me.  It was then that I could see the fear and sadness in her eyes.\n\nInside…well, inside I felt like a burned out house collapsing in on itself.  At first I refused to watch, to do anything they wanted me to do.  Solomon didn’t get mad at me, but just shrugged.  He said while cooperation was preferred and could go a long way toward making my stay with them more comfortable, it wasn’t required.  \n\nIf he was right, Solomon said with a thin smile, things would play out as they were meant to, regardless of what I wanted or thought I chose.  Either way, he added, the video was about to start back playing and would not stop for another five days.  Whether I wanted to spend that time getting to see her again was entirely up to me.\n\nI tried to not watch, but a part of me knew from the start I was going to.  Maybe I would find some clue that they were lying about her being dead.  Or Rachel could give me some advice or warning about what I needed to do next.  I didn’t know.  What I did know is that I couldn’t miss the chance to see her again.  And despite knowing in my heart that she was dead and everything on the video had happened a long time ago, I still felt that by watching I was with her somehow.  \n\nShe had been taken away from everything she knew when she was barely grown, trapped for years just for being special.  Experimented on.  Treated like property.  Kept from ever having friends or family or a life.  And yet through all that, she was still beautiful.  Not just on the outside, but on the inside too.  I had spent years watching her, getting to know her in a thousand tiny ways that so few people ever truly know each other.  I had seen her kindness and grace in her actions, even when she was fighting against the people holding her.  I had watched her strength when she woke up day after day in her prison and never gave up.  And I saw the beauty of her soul in her paintings, full of swirling colors and…what was the word…wonder.  She was able to paint these things she saw with such care and love, despite living in a world that had abandoned her so completely.\n\nWell I wasn’t abandoning her.  I would watch every bit of the video I could manage.  Try to burn into my memory every frame of her I saw.  Not for them and their stupid project.  But for me.  And for her.  I may not have much left to do in my life before they lock me away somewhere or kill me, but I could do this one last thing.\n\nRachel wouldn’t die alone.\n\n****\n\nI watched nearly all of it, stopping only to eat quickly and use the bathroom until the last two days.  I would ask the guards to pause it, but they would only shake their heads and say Solomon said it had to play normally until it was finished.  By the fourth day, I was in a stupor.  I had already dozed some the first three days, but when I woke up on the fourth day, I could tell a few hours had passed.  There were two trays of food on the bed, one breakfast and another lunch.  I looked back at the screen in a panic, worrying I had missed something, but Rachel seemed to be just waking up too.  I noticed her putting her hand to her stomach as she got out of bed and felt my own stomach twist.  She was already hurting.  Rachel glanced at the camera and tried to smile before moving to set up a new canvas for painting.  \n\nThis was the second of three paintings she did in those last days.  The first had been the inside of an old-fashioned movie theater from the viewpoint of someone sitting in a back row.  On the movie screen was just the image of a sledgehammer propped against a brick wall.  I didn’t understand what it meant, and I found myself scanning the picture for some message or other clue.  Eventually I found what might be one, though I didn’t understand it either.\n\nRachel must have come to understand they knew what she was doing with the paintings and didn’t want to stop her, because these last three she set up much closer to the camera.  I was still squinting and studying the painting closely when I realized the flipped up seats in the next row up had brass number plates along the front edge of the seats.  Though they were upside down from the viewpoint of the painting, the angle was good enough that once I noticed them I was able to read them.  \n\n**2…43…26…89**\n\nI didn’t understand any of it, but I committed it all to memory, focusing all my attention on the painting until she finally took it away.  Even that early on I could tell painting was taking a lot out of her now, and like I had for so long, I found myself talking to her, telling her to go rest before I remembered her body in the next room.  I almost stopped then, but no.  Maybe she couldn’t tell I was talking to her, or maybe she could.  Either way, me talking to her couldn’t hurt, and it made me feel a little less lonely and sad as I watched her.\n\nThe second painting, the one she started after I woke up from falling asleep for a few hours, was stranger than the rest.  It looked like it was in a room with curved walls made of tree roots, and in the center of the room was a little table made out of the same stuff.  Some of the roots around the room were a deep red, but other parts, including the table thing, looked burned and black.  I looked closer and saw that I could see a person’s shadow over the table—hands holding some long oval-shaped bundle.\n\nI studied it for a long time, going over it again and again in my mind after she took it away.  I couldn’t make sense of it.  Of any of it.  I wasn’t smart enough, and I was failing her.\n\nRachel slept for a long time after that painting.  Then she got up on the fifth day, her last day, and immediately started working again.  This time she was painting faster, and while I saw her wince occasionally, she never lost her look of determination as she slashed lines and colors across the canvas.  When she was done, Rachel picked up the painting and turned it toward the camera, giving me a small, tired smile as she was blocked from view.\n\nIt was looking out from the front porch of a house somewhere.  It was out in the country, and the morning view of the yard and the land beyond were wonderful, but closer-up the painting was of two hands.  Holding onto each other tightly, their interlocked fingers seemed to glow red and orange in the light of the rising sun.  I found myself crying as I looked at it.  \n\nPart of it was because I didn’t know what it meant, and I felt a growing sense of desperation at the thought that Rachel’s last works might be wasted on me.  Part was because I knew it had been five days, and I could sense I was close to the end.  To her end.\n\nBut there was something more to it than all that too.  The last painting…even with everything else in my head and my heart pulling me down…gave me hope.  Hope of what, I didn’t know.  But I started to think that maybe the only message Rachel had for me in that last painting was that somehow, somewhere, everything would be okay.\n\nOutside the edge of the painting I could see motion in the room.  People hurriedly coming in with some kind of medical equipment.  And then the monitor went black.\n\n****\n\n“You’ve done well, Thomas.  Very, very well.  For the last five days of video, we had charted one thousand and forty-seven microvariations in Rachel’s behavior that we believed might correspond to your behavior, your reactions, and your emotional states while watching the video.  Like before, the two of you remained in sync as though you were in the same room.  It really is remarkable.”\n\nI sat staring at Solomon.  I listened to what he said, but I didn’t care.  I just wanted it over.  Whatever this was, I just wanted it over.\n\nClearing his throat, he went on.  “That’s why we’ve decided to move the implant from Rachel’s body to your own.  That’s one of the many reasons we’ve preserved her so.  The foreign body was still showing signs of life all this time, but just barely, and we were afraid to attempt removal.  Our hope is that, given your connection to Rachel, it will accept you.  Perhaps even thrive in you more than it ever did our girl.”\n\nI was suddenly on my feet, and it was only the raising of Solomon’s gun that stopped me from attacking him.  “Don’t you fucking talk about her like that.  Like any of you gave a shit about her.  I’ll fucking kill you.”\n\nSolomon’s face darkened slightly as his lips thinned.  “No, you won’t.  But if idle threats make you feel better, go ahead.  It will only make things harder, not easier.”\n\nFeeling a stab of panicked fear, I sat back down.  “What is this thing you’re going to put in me?”\n\nThe man looked at me for several seconds before responding.  “I’m tempted not to tell you after your stupid—and frankly, hurtful—outburst.  But I’ll be the bigger person.”  Letting out a small sigh, he went on.  “Thomas, somewhere there is a tree.  A very special tree.  We suspect it is the same tree that Rachel painted for you that time, though we cannot say for sure, as we have never been able to find it.  It is either hidden away very well or it is able to hide itself from those it wishes.”\n\nI just looked at him, trying to kill him by just wanting it to be so.  “In any case, we have the next best thing.  An ancient clipping from the tree.  Secured at great cost and sacrifice, and studied for a long time without much success.  We have, however, in recent years been given…advice, that this clipping could be grown in the right soil.  We thought that soil was Rachel, but while it did develop further inside of her, she died before the necessary growth was finished.”\n\nLeaning forward, he smiled at me.  “We have it on fairly good authority, however, that you might succeed where she failed.”\n\n****\n\nI fought them when they came, but it didn’t matter.  I woke up some time later with a dull ache in my chest and a small, already healing scar on my upper stomach.  I didn’t really feel that different other than the little bit of pain, but I knew that would change with time.  Maybe I had more time than Rachel, or maybe I had less.  It didn’t matter.  I just…\n\n*Wait, what was that?*\n\nThere was some kind of soft voice…coming from where?  It wasn’t in the room.  It was in my head.  I felt a thrill of excitement.  Maybe this was Rachel’s voice.  She had somehow stayed in the tree thing they had put inside me?\n\nBut no.  I had never heard Rachel’s voice, but I sensed this wasn’t it.  This voice was too delicate to really be heard or understood, and it reminded me of music coming from a distant room that you felt in the back of your mind without realizing it.  It was a…a melody, a kind of song.  But it wasn’t Rachel’s song.  I realized with a shiver that it was the song of the thing inside of me.\n\nAt first I was afraid, but that didn’t last long.  It wasn’t trying to hurt me.  It was trapped here just like I was.  *But*, it started to sing, *it was time for us to be free.*\n\nI stood up and walked to the door, and as I did so, the lights went out.  The door in front of me clicked, and when I reached out and turned the knob in the dark, it opened easily.  How was this possible?  And if it could do this, why hadn’t it helped Rachel get out?  There was no answer, but there was also no time.  I could already hear boots around the corner as the glow from flashlights began to light up the far end of the hall.  \n\nThey would drag me back in there.  Chain me up or take this thing back out of me before we could get away.  If I was ever going to get out, it had to be now.  The voice was singing again, pushing me to go further into the dark, to run until we were safe.\n\nSo I listened and I ran.\n\n****\n\nEvery door unlocked for me, every turn kept me barely out of sight.  The people looking for me were barking orders over a radio, asking someone what was the hold up on the generator kicking on.  Whatever the response, the hallways stayed dark as I drifted through them blind but not falling, lost but not being found.  \n\nWhen I reached the final door, I opened it into a bright afternoon.  My lungs burned a little at the first fresh, unrecycled air I had breathed in a week.  Blinking, I waited for the voice to tell me where to go, but it had fallen silent.  I closed the door as panic began to rise in my chest.  All this and I would get caught because I didn’t know where to go.  I was outside a plain brown building in the middle of nowhere.  There was a road going off to the right, and to the left there was…\n\n*Rachel’s forest, from her first painting to me.*\n\nI knew it was the same forest immediately, and not just because of it matching the painting so closely.  I had some strange sense that felt like a kind of magnetism, or how birds know which way to fly.  Looking around for a second, I felt like I was being pulled when I looked again at those woods.  This was right.  Somehow, I knew this was the way I needed to go.\n\nSo I went.\n\nI had made it to the edge of the forest when I heard the noise of men coming outside the building.  I thought about hiding, but I knew it was a bad idea.  They would just catch me, and I felt a drive to go deeper into the woods.  I plunged ahead, running at close to a reckless speed but never tripping or stumbling as I went.  I would occasionally hear a noise behind me as they spread out to search, but the sounds grew fainter as I ran.  I almost thought I had lost them for good when I heard a short cough that was quickly muffled off to my left.  Someone had gotten close without me knowing it. \n\nPanicking, I looked for any places I could hide.  There were only bushes and trees and…over there.  A well.  Not just *a* well, but Rachel’s well, with the same worn, grey stone walls capped with a weathered wooden lid.  I felt a moment of happy recognition, but then it faded away.  How did that help?  They’d check the well if they found it, and I didn’t have any way to get down in it without getting hurt or stuck.  Then an idea stuck me.\n\nCrouching low and staying to the brush, I moved to the well and gingerly pushed on the lid.  At first it resisted, but when I pushed a bit harder, the wooden circle slid aside enough that you could clearly see someone moved it.  Glancing around, I eased back into the bushes as I heard soft footfalls approaching.\n\n“We need to check this out.”\n\n“You think he went down the well?  Better hope not.  He probably broke his neck if he did, and then its our asses.”\n\nI could see the two men approaching.  Both of them were wearing dark body armor and carried assault rifles.  The older of the two shrugged back at the other one.  “Better that than he was hiding in there and we *didn’t* check.”\n\nLooking irritated, the younger man nodded.  “I’ll look.”  He went over to the well and shoved the wooden lid aside, causing it to clatter to the ground.  Hitting a button on his rifle, a flashlight sprang to life on the barrel.  He started to shine it down into the well as the other continued to look in every direction.  I was worried he would see me if I moved, but I couldn’t wait.  I just had to stay calm.  Think slow and move fast.\n\nI kept expecting to hear them yell, or feel something or someone strike me in the back, but nothing came.  As the afternoon light began to dim, I saw the trees thinning ahead.  I was approaching a road.  It looked like a normal, public road too, with several cars passing one way or the other as I walked out of the forest and up the hill to the asphalt.\n\nThe idea of hitchhiking, especially this close to where they held me, was frightening, but I saw little choice.  I was wearing sweatpants and a t-shirt they had given me and my own shoes, but I had no money or ID or phone.  My only chance was to get far enough away that I could try and get help.\n\nI jumped slightly at the hiss of hydraulic brakes as a large semi rolled to a stop next to me.  The passenger window rolled down and an older man with white hair and a greying mustache leaned over and peered down at me.  \n\n“You look lost, son.  You need a ride?”\n\nI looked down at the door of the truck.  It had a logo that said “Martinez and Sons Construction and Hauling”  Below it was a cartoon man hitting a wall with a sledgehammer.  Looking back up, I smiled at him.\n\n“Yes sir, I do.”\n\n****\nI woke up five hours later as we pulled into a truck stop somewhere in Nevada.  I had planned on staying awake the entire trip, but that had only lasted a few minutes before exhaustion overtook me.  I glanced over at Oliver Martinez and he gave me a toothy grin.\n\n“I’m tired, but you were plumb tuckered out.  I’ve got to fuel up, shower and get some grub.  I’m going on to California after that.  If you want to ride further, just be back here in an hour.  Sound good?”\n\nI nodded and thanked him again for the ride as I got out.  I felt groggy from sleeping, but otherwise okay.  I just needed to decide whether this was a good spot to ask for help or if I should ride with Martinez further.  He seemed like a very nice guy, and he would probably try to help if he could, but I wanted to avoid putting more people in danger if I could help it.  Looking around, I saw we were in a fairly nice little town.  I decided I would go look around for a few minutes and then decide what to do.\n\nI was only three blocks down the street when I saw the flickering lights in the distance.  It was a movie theater.  As I got closer, I felt my chest tightening.  It was the one from Rachel’s painting.\n\n****\n\n“Hey there.  Welcome to the Phoenix.”\n\nThe guy standing at the candy counter of the theater looked a little younger than me, and while he seemed friendly enough, he also looked slightly concerned.\n\n“If you’re here for the horror double-feature, I’m afraid the second movie is about thirty minutes in.  I can give you a half-rate if you want to see it though.”\n\nI shook my head and tried to not look as strange and crazy as I felt.  “No, that’s okay.  I…well, I recognized this place from a picture a friend of mine painted.  So I came in to ask if you knew anything about her.”\n\nHe raised his eyebrows and shrugged.  “Okay, weird.”  He smiled and added, “Weird but interesting.  Who is she?”\n\nI swallowed.  “Her name is…well, it was, Rachel Donovan.”\n\nI expected him to look surprised or excited or angry, but I could see right away the name meant nothing to him.  Shaking his head, he shrugged again.  “Sorry, that doesn’t ring a bell.  I’d say you could ask the owner, but he’s on vacation this week.”\n\nNodding, I searched my mind for something else to ask, some way to make this place matter the way her other paintings had.  “Is there anything unique about this place then?  Its history or something?”\n\nThe man grinned.  “Buddy, you’re clearly not from here.  This place is super boring.  Not just the theater, but the whole town.”  Frowning in thought, he added.  “The only thing I know about the history of this place is that there used to be a house here that burned down.  This was like in the 1920s or 30s when this wasn’t even a part of town.  Couldn’t tell you the first thing about it beyond that, but I still bet it’s the most interesting thing that’s ever happened here.”\n\nI let out a disappointed sigh.  “Okay.  Well, thanks.”  I turned to leave when the guy called out again.\n\n“Hey man, sorry I couldn’t help more.  If you come back, I’ll get you a discount on a movie.  Half-off.  If I’m not working, tell them Marshall said it was okay.”\n\nI waved and tried to smile as I headed for the door with a heavy heart.  Why did you lead me here, Rachel?  What’s here that will help?\n\nI was outside again, staring up at the theater’s bright blinking signs as though they were going to give me some kind of secret signal, when I noticed movement out of the corner of my eye.  There was an alley that ran along side the theater and went behind it to…something.  Whatever was back there, the light of a distant security lamp cast shadows along the wall of the alley, and those shadows were moving.\n\nInstead of feeling afraid, I felt excited as I started down the alley.  Rachel had led me here, and I just had to trust that there was a reason for it.  Keep looking until I…\n\nThe shadows were made by leaves blowing in some wind I couldn’t feel.  As I got to the far end of the alley, I saw there was a small back yard behind the theater surrounded by a chain link fence, and on the other side of that fence was the tree from Rachel’s painting, with its deep red twisting bark and foam of green leaves waving to and fro in the night air.\n\nI felt a surge of warmth in my chest as the distant singing began again.  This was the place.  The special tree that could not be found unless it wanted you to find it.  It sat at the edge of a small overgrown lot surrounded on all sides by buildings and yards, somehow forgotten when whatever this land had once been was divided up, and despite its location, I had a strong sense that I was the first to see it in a very long time.\n\nClimbing the fence, I felt a jagged wire dig into my leg and rip my pants as I fell over the top.  I was bleeding a little, but I hardly noticed.  I could smell the tree now, and it was a rich, good smell unlike any I had smelled before.  Reaching out to it, I felt the singing grow louder as I touched it.  I felt stronger and less afraid then, and when I saw the light opening up at its roots, I didn’t tremble, I smiled.\n\nThere was a hidden tunnel under the tree.  A tunnel filled with sweet-smelling air that was like the tree smell but also different.  And the tunnel wasn’t dark—no, not at all.  It glowed with its own golden light that called to me, urged me forward.  Rain was beginning to fall as I looked around the dark lot.  I had the thought that I was leaving this world behind.\n\nAnd I found I didn’t mind that much at all.\n\nThe tunnel had continued to grow, slanting down gently and tall enough that I walked in without stooping.  The roots of the tree went on and on, woven through the dirt walls as I went deeper.  I looked back and saw the tunnel had closed behind me, but I wasn’t surprised.  The way forward was the only way that mattered.\n\nI walked for what might have been hours, but I never felt tired or hungry.  And I never worried I was lost, though I had no idea where I was or where I was going.  Still, I felt a surge of happiness and excitement when I turned a corner and saw something in the tunnel ahead.  As I got closer I realized it was a brick wall, but just as I began to think I had found a dead end, the wall faded away, revealing a dark room.\n\nI paused at the edge of the tunnel, looking out at the floor of what looked like a basement.  It was empty, but in the light from the tree I could make out something scratched into the floor.  It was the number two.  I felt my pulse quicken as I thought back to Rachel’s painting with the theater seats, and then I stepped out into the room.\n\nIt was the empty basement of a house, and as I went up the stairs and opened the door, I saw that the rest of the house was empty as well.  No lights were on, but bright sunlight poured in through every window and in the distance I could hear what sounded like small waves crashing on a beach.  I wanted to go out and see where I was, but I forced myself to check the house first for any people or clues.  But there were none.  The house was utterly bare of any sign of people other than the number scratched into the floor below.\n\nMy nose tingled with salty air as I stepped outside.  The house was near the beach on what I soon figured out was a small, deserted island, and I realized with little surprise that I recognized the house from Rachel’s painting.  As I stepped off the porch, I saw no signs of people, but I wasn’t entirely alone.  Because sitting some distance from the house, was the tree.  \n\nI knew it couldn’t be the same tree as in the abandoned lot, but at the same time I knew that it was.  Or at least a different part of the same tree that made the tunnels and appeared in my old world and whatever place this was.  \n\nBecause I had started having that thought as soon as I stepped out of the house.  I didn’t think this was my world.  Not exactly.  I could see a larger island some distance away, and it might have people on it.  Hotels and cars and planes.  Or it might not, as those things might not exist here.  Either way, my newfound intuition was growing stronger, and I could tell that the…what was it called?  The con…no, the texture of things was different somehow, if only a little.  Not bad or scary, just different.\n\nStill, after a couple of hours exploring the island and checking the house, I began to feel terribly lonely, even with the tree nearby.  I decided to go back into the tunnel and keep going.  The basement wall faded away as I walked up to it, and I entered the tunnels again.\n\nIt was only a short time later that I found my second version of the house.  Much like the first, the wall faded away into a basement, but this one was far from empty.  It was a workshop of some kind, full of tools I wasn’t familiar with.  I glanced down and saw “43” scratched onto the floor.  Who was doing that?  And why?\n\nI was going to explore the house, more carefully this time, as it looked like there were people here, but then I froze.  Propped against the brick wall, next to a small stack of boards, was a sledgehammer.  Trying to be quiet, I crept over and picked it up before heading back into the tunnel.\n\n****\n\nWhen I was little, before Daddy died, he had loved to hunt.  I never went with him and didn’t remember much of what he hunted, but I do know he had an old hound he’d had since before I was born.  The dog had only loved him—well, him and being on the trail of something.  When Rocker (his name was Rockerfeller) got a scent, it was like he was in a trance.  He would go and go, this way and that, and to look at him, it looked like he was having a fit—both lost and certain at the same time.  But whatever Rocker knew or didn’t know, he always found what he was looking for. \n\nI felt like Rocker now.  I was moving faster and faster as I went down this turn and that.  I felt like I was on the trail of something or traveling on memories I didn’t have.  Gripping the sledgehammer tightly, I could hear the rising hum of the distant music in my head as I turned the last corner, and then it fell silent.\n\nThere was another brick wall, and as I approached, it fell away.\n\nIt was another basement room, but this one was much smaller.  It contained a table, a clothes chest, and an old metal bed that had been broken apart.  At the far brick wall, a woman was using one of the metal legs from the bed to attack the wall and whatever lay behind it.  I felt my head began to swim as I looked at her from behind, and as she turned to look at me, eyes wide with surprise and fear, I felt the sledgehammer slip from my grip as I stumbled back against the now solid wall.  I could barely breathe at all, but I managed to get out a single word.\n\n“Rachel?”\n\nThe woman looked at me, her expression less fearful but still guarded.  She had the bed leg partially raised in warning.  [“Yeah?  Do I know you?”](https:\/\/redd.it\/8uj33q)\n\n****\n \n**** \n\n**** \n\n**** \n\n\n\n\nIt was her, but it wasn’t, much like the tree on the island.  This Rachel looked a few years older, and while she looked stressed and confused at the moment, her eyes didn’t seem weighted down by the same quiet sadness I had come to recognize watching the other Rachel for all that time.  Still, I didn’t know how to answer her question and not sound creepy or crazy.  I stared at her for a second, floundering, when she asked another.\n\n“You came out of the tree tunnel, right?”\n\nI nodded, grateful for something I could answer easily.\n\nStudying me, she said.  “Where did you come from?  Before the tunnel I mean.”\n\nI flushed as I tried to think of the right words.  “Um, well, I came from Texas.  Originally I mean.”\n\nShe grinned at me for a second before catching herself and trying to look serious again.  “Yeah, okay.  But like…do you know how the tree works?  How did you find out about the tunnel?  How did you get here?”\n\nSighing, I rubbed my head and just started into it.\n\n“Look, I know this will sound crazy, but I had a job watching a woman trapped in a room, and that woman was you, or another version of you, and she asked me for help, and I couldn’t help her and then they took me, and I found out she had been dead for a long time but could see me in the future and then they put something from the tree in me that had been in her that killed her and then I escaped and then I figured out where to go to find the tree from things she had painted and I somehow knew how to go in the tunnels to find different spots, and I’m pretty sure the tunnels lead to different worlds and I got this sledgehammer and then I…”\n\n“Hold up.  God damn.  Take a breath.  You’re going to pass out.”  She was smiling again, and this time she didn’t try to hide it.  She looked over what was left of the bed to where the sledgehammer was laying on the floor.  “And did you say sledgehammer?”\n\n****\n\n**Whack**\n\n“So yeah, I believe you.”\n\n**Whack**\n\n“I’ve been in those tunnels too.  My ex-boyfriend tricked me into moving here so he could tie me to the tree in his place.”\n\n**Whack** \n\n“Well, not tie me to the tree literally.  Take his place as…what?  The tree’s buddy or something?  I don’t really know.  It’s all pretty fucked up and I don’t understand all of it.”\n**Whack**\n\n“But what I do understand is that the fucker walled me up in here.  At first, I thought I could just pry loose some bricks over time, but nope.  He put a layer of concrete on the outside this time.  Good ol’ Phil.  Or Justin.  Or whatever.  I mainly think of him as Fuckface now.”\n\n**Whack**\n\n“This is taking forever.”\n\nI stepped up and put my hand on the sledgehammer.  “Let me do it for a bit.  We can take turns.”  We had cleared away even more brick than she had already managed, but the concrete wall was only starting to show small cracks.  I wanted to just keep looking at her, have her talk to me, but I knew she was tired.  She nodded reluctantly and let go of the hammer.  Before I swung, I looked back at her.  “How long have you been in here like this?”\n\n**Whack** \n\nRachel scowled.  “It’s hard to say for sure, but I think about eight months.”\n\nI let the hammer drop down again as my eyes widened.  “How did you survive all that time?”\n\nHer scowl deepened.  “It’s the tree.  It won’t let me die.  I just dip into the tunnel every day for a bit and I never get that hungry or thirsty.”\n\nA thought occurred to me then.  “Why didn’t you just escape through the tunnels?”\n\nShe quickly shook her head.  “No, thank you.  I’ve had enough of seeing other worlds.  Some of them aren’t so nice.  And I don’t want to be more tied to the tree than I already am.  I just want out of here, into my own world, and then I can try and figure out how to get free of my connection to the tree for good.”  Rachel shrugged.  “I would have done it eventually with the stupid bed parts, but who knows how long it would have taken?”  She smiled again.  “I’m very happy you came to help and brought a sledgehammer with you.”\n\nReturning her smile, I nodded as I lifted the hammer again.  “Me too.”\n\n**Whack**\n\n****\n\nWe were both wringing with sweat when we crawled through the hole we’d made in the outer wall.  Rachel told me that she thought her ex-boyfriend was long gone, but she couldn’t be sure, so we had to be careful.  Grabbing the sledgehammer from inside the room, we made our way toward the stairs.\n\nThe house was decorated but quiet, and we saw no sign of anyone as we walked to the front door and opened it.  Outside, the sun was coming up on a new day, and as we walked out onto the porch, I jumped a little as Rachel took my hand and gave it a squeeze.  I looked over at her.  \n\nI hadn’t been able to help the other Rachel, but maybe that had never been the point at all.  Because I thought now she had been able to see more than just other places or the future.  She had been able to see into other worlds and possibilities. \n\nLike this one, where another version of her was trapped and needed help.  A place where I wouldn’t be hunted and she could be free.  In the end, even when she knew she was dying, Rachel had been determined to help us be together and happy.\n\nThe morning sun painted beautiful colors on Rachel’s face, and looking into her eyes I saw how much she was like the woman I had watched and cared about and tried to save.  The woman who, in the end, had saved me instead.  I wanted to tell Rachel so many things, ask her so many questions, but all that could come later.  Squeezing her hand back, I walked with her away from the house.\n\n[For now, this was enough.](https:\/\/redd.it\/bue253)\n\n****\n\n[You have a delivery scheduled.](https:\/\/redd.it\/cbn7uj)\n\n[The Ghost Tree](https:\/\/redd.it\/kfvzse)"},"248":{"title":"We’ve been stuck in construction traffic for 8 hours now. If we leave our vehicles we will die.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/bvy4vv\/weve_been_stuck_in_construction_traffic_for_8\/","flair":"Series","author":"nslewis","selftext":"Lauren is in the Honda Accord right behind my truck, with our two cats, but I can’t get out and see her. The last guy who got out was shot in the legs and then run over by a tank.\n\nWe set out yesterday from Gainesville, Florida, where Lauren had recently graduated from law school. We were moving to my home state of Maine, to start a permanent life together. The drive was beautiful most of the way, and Lauren and I spent a lot of time on speaker phone with each other to comment on it. A couple of times we passed through rain, and once a really wild thunderstorm that lit up the whole sky for miles. Then, about 8 hours ago, we hit a traffic jam on I-95 just outside of Lewiston, Maine.\n\nI took a look at the navigation thing on my phone, but it didn’t show any red areas of heavy delay. It also had some trouble showing my exact location, though, so I lit a cigarette and figured it would just be a few minutes.\n\nAfter about fifteen minutes, I called Lauren. “How’s it going back there?” I asked. In the background, I could hear the cats going nuts.\n\n“Not great,” said Lauren. “Do you hear Hankie and Hattie howling? They started up as soon as we stopped. What's going on?”\n\n“Must be an accident that just happened. My phone usually gives a heads up if there’s planned construction or something.” I heard one of the cats hiss while the other one yowled.\n\n“I’m so tired,” said Lauren.\n\n“I know, me too. Let’s stop and get something to eat once we’re through, yeah?”\n\n“Okay.”\n\n“Alright. Love you. Sorry about the cats.”\n\n“Love you,” said Lauren.\n\nI hung up and tried to get something on the radio. I have a base model 2006 Toyota Tundra, so no AUX jack, and the CD player had broken years ago. During the entire trip, I had been at the mercy of radio stations, and for the most part, they didn’t do much for me other than create a general atmosphere of annoyance.\n\nNow, though, I couldn't even keep the radio on. What wasn't warbling static was some kind of distorted robotic voice reading off a list of numbers and random words strung together. Across the whole radio band, same thing. I couldn't take it so I shut it off.\n\nI picked my phone back up and went to check Twitter. All I got was that game where you have to jump the dinosaur over cacti faster and faster and then it gets dark out and the birds come. No internet. Finally, Twitter did half-load, so there was *some* intermittent reception there, barely.\n\nAfter a half hour had passed, I started to get antsy, and so did everyone else. People were sticking their heads out the window to try to see what was going on, but it was no use. The line of cars seemed endless. A few people got out of their vehicles to try to get a better look. I got out too and started walking to Lauren’s car.\n\nWhen I was halfway there, a voice cut into the air. It sounded like someone shouting through a bullhorn. “Return immediately to your vehicles! No one is permitted to be outside! This is your only warning. If you do not heed it, there will be severe consequences.”\n\n“Wha da *fuck* is goin’ on?!” some guy shouted in a thick Boston accent; he was standing a few car lengths in front of me. An instant later, he was down on the ground, not moving. I didn’t see what happened exactly, but that was enough to make me to hustle back to my truck.\n\nI tried calling Lauren again. When she answered all that I could hear were broken flashes of the cats screaming and Lauren sounding scared and begging to know what was happening.\n\n“I don’t know,” I said, not sure that she could hear it. “Maybe they’re searching for a criminal or something. I don’t know.” Then we were disconnected.\n\nA minute later, an ambulance was wailing its way down the right hand shoulder. It stopped just past my truck, and two EMTs jumped out of the back. They closed the doors behind them, but I saw that there was somebody else in there. Somebody dressed in riot gear, holding a big gun.\n\nThe EMTs dragged the guy with the Boston accent by the arms over to the ambulance. They opened the doors and sort of tossed him in, and then followed behind. I saw the riot gear person again for a second, and then the doors slammed shut and the ambulance sped off down the shoulder out of sight.\n\nSomebody four cars ahead of me got the idea to follow the ambulance out of there. I watched as a red Hyundai Sonata with a New Jersey license plate tore into the shoulder lane and sped after the ambulance.\n\nI tried calling Lauren to ask her if she thought we should try it too. It was a ballsy move for sure, but she had sounded at the end of her rope stuck in there with our wailing cats, so I thought she might be willing to give it a shot. This time, the call didn’t even go through.\n\nI was getting ready to try calling again when I heard this loud blast. A puff of smoke blossomed somewhere up ahead, and all of a sudden, there were chunks of a car flying through the air. A red car. Very likely a red Hyundai Sonata.\n\nAs I watched a flaming tire roll to a stop against the highway divider, I decided not to replicate New Jersey’s maneuver.\n\nI heard the blast of a horn behind me, and looked in the rearview to see that Lauren had her arm out the window, moving her hand around in a circle. Finally, it hit me that she was telling me to roll down my window, so that’s what I did.\n\n“Can you hear me?” she shouted.\n\n“I can!” I could even hear the cats. They sounded really freaked out.\n\n“What is happening?!” she asked.\n\n“I don’t know baby! I think we’re in some kind of military lockdown maybe! I think we have to just sit tight here.”\n\n“Can you throw me a bottle?” asked Lauren.\n\n“What?”\n\n“A bottle! Like Gatorade or something. I know that you’ve probably got ten of them in your front seat.\n\nIt was true. Not ten exactly, but close enough. I just threw all of my trash on the seat of my truck until it started overflowing, whereas Lauren kept her car clean. “What are you going to do with the bottle?” I asked.\n\n“Not something I want to shout out for the whole world to hear!” said Lauren. “Let’s just say we’ve been here a while and I don’t think we’re coming to a rest stop soon enough.”\n\nFinally, I understood. I reached over and grabbed a bottle. I chucked it out the window, but it was a bad throw, and bounced off the hood of Lauren’s Honda. I tried again, and this time she caught it. She rolled up her window and in the rearview mirror I watched her fuss around as she presumably tried to pee into the thing.\n\nThis was when the fleet of massive trucks started rolling in, on the southbound side of the highway divide. Some of them had cranes sitting on long flat beds, and others had big chunks of some kind of metal material. Soon, the southbound side was jammed up with these giant trucks and their haul. Then they started to get to work.\n\n“What are they doing?!” asked Lauren. She’d opened her window back up. “Are they… building a fucking *wall*?!”\n\nThat is exactly what it looked like they were doing. One crane would take a massive chunk of material, and lift it into place either next to, or on top of, another chunk.\n\n“Yes! They’re walling us in!” I shouted. I checked my phone for the thousandth time. I had a bar, and used it to call 911.\n\nA lady answered. “What is the address for this emergency?”\n\n“I… uh… I-95 northbound, just before Lewiston, Maine. I forget the exit number we were coming up on. I’m sorry.”\n\n“That’s okay. What is the emergency?”\n\n“Well… we’re in this weird traffic jam… and… people are dying here. Cars are exploding. They’re building a wall around us. They’re trapping us here. I know that sounds crazy….”\n\nThere was a long silence on the other end. I thought maybe we’d been disconnected. But then I heard her voice again, crystal clear.\n\n“Sir, I am going to need you to remain calm and stay in your vehicle. And if you would, roll down your window. Not the driver’s side, the passenger’s side.”\n\n“W… what?” I asked. Then I heard the tapping at my window. There was a lady cop standing there, holding a cell phone up to her ear. My heart jumped up into my throat, and my instinct was to slam my foot on the gas pedal, but there was nowhere to go. I rolled down the window.\n\n“You reported an emergency?” asked the cop. “Everything looks okay to me. We don’t discourage anyone from calling emergency services if they truly think that there might be an emergency situation occurring, but everything appears to be perfectly fine here. I will give you the benefit of the doubt this time, but remember that we also very strongly frown upon fraudulent 911 calls. You could be charged for that, sir. It’s no joke.”\n\n“Oh,” I said, trying to hold it together. “I’m sorry about that. I *did* think that something bad was going on, but now I see that everything is okay. Thanks for checking in.”\n\n“It’s no problem at all, sir,” said the cop, smiling. “And remember: *stay in your vehicle*.”\n\n“Of course,” I said, trying to smile, though I’m sure my face looked like a sweaty pretzel instead.\n\nThe cop nodded and then walked off down the line of cars. I waited a few minutes, and then called out to Lauren.\n\n“I think we’re fucked!” I said. “I called 911 and that cop that was just here? She’s the one who picked up. She said everything’s fine… but it’s not.”\n\n“Fuck!” said Lauren. “What do we do?!”\n\nThat’s when the guy jumped out of his car and made a break for the wooded area to the right of the highway. And that’s when they shot him in the legs. I heard him cry out and watched him hit the ground. I heard a loud continuous rumble, interspersed with snaps from the woods. Then I saw the tank. It didn’t so much emerge from the woods as it destroyed the woods in its wake. Beyond it, I saw another enormous wall. We were walled-in from two sides… and my guess was that we were walled-in from four sides.\n\nThe tank crushed the man like he was a particularly small ant.\n\n\\*\n\nThey are working on the roof now. It's almost done. Once the roof is on, I have a feeling that I won't get any reception at all. Before that happens, I'm hoping for one more spike so that I can get this post out.\n\nI don't know if this is on the news or not. I thought it was just a traffic jam, so that's probably how they're playing it off. They probably have rerouted traffic around us by now.\n\nI don't know what this is. But there are now dozens of heavily armed people in riot gear going from car to car. Sometimes they drag somebody out, and carry them screaming off to what remains of the wooded area, where they disappear from sight.\n\nThey're almost at my truck now. I hope they skip me, and Lauren. Oh God. I'm going to tell her that I love her.\n\nIf this reaches you, I don't know what you can do, but please try to help us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/bxoscy\/we_were_stuck_in_construction_traffic_for_8_hours\/)\n\n[Part 3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/byqo1k\/we_were_stuck_in_construction_traffic_for_8_hours\/)"},"249":{"title":"The Chernobyl disaster was a coverup of something terrifying","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/bz0dl9\/the_chernobyl_disaster_was_a_coverup_of_something\/","flair":"Series","author":"DELTA129","selftext":"Narrations:  \n\n\n[Mr. Creeps](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pylxyu24g1g)  \n\n[The Dark Somnium](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_rDRRXlCdC4)  \n\n**TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO KEEP DMing ME ID THE STORY IS TRUE**: Please see the description and nature of the subreddit where it is posted.\n  \n\n\n  \nYou probably heard about tourism in the Chernobyl exclusion zone. I’ve been there myself several times. And it’s nothing like what you see in games or horror movies. There are no ghosts, mutants or radioactive anomalies and death isn’t waiting for you at every corner. Actually, I think it’s one of the most peaceful and prettiest places on Earth. An example of strength of nature and how it can reverse the damage that we caused it.\n\nThus, when my friend Alexei decided to go there, he knew who to contact. He's a physics student and right now he’s doing some kind of research on nuclear fallout and he said that he wanted to get some direct measurements and samples. But we both knew that it’s just an excuse to go on an “adventure”. We visited the old powerplant, the abandoned city Pripyat and the surrounding exclusion zone. It was nice, but I would probably just bore you with more details. That part is not important anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe were driving on some dirt roads in a forest east of Pripyat when we found it. An old, rusty fence and a chained gate that blocked any further passage. There was a big sign with a radiation hazard symbol and captioned: “Restricted area. Authorized personnel only”.\n\nThere was a pair of massive metal blast doors in the side an artificially-looking hill not far behind the fence, with a large, white “O-13” painted on it and “NO ENTRY” sprayed on top.\n\n“What do you think it is?” Alex asked.\n\n“I don’t know, looks like some kind of bunker,” I replied. “And it looks like it has been closed for some time,” I added after taking a closer look at the doors. The both halves were welded shut in the center. Alex took his samples and readings, but we were too puzzled to leave just yet.\n\n“Do you think we can get in?” I asked.\n\n“Well not this way for sure. Even if it wasn’t welded sealed, I’m sure we have no way of unlocking it.” Alex replied while examining the massive door.\n\n“It looks like an underground bunker. They must have had a way to pump air inside and I don’t think this is it. There has to be another way to get in.” I said.\n\nWe circled the main entrance to try find other means of entry. The day was already coming to an end and it was slowly getting darker. As we were searching, a thought crossed my mind.\n\nWhy would they weld the doors? What’s so important inside that they went this far to keep people away?\n\n“Look, there’s something there,” Alex pulled me away from my thoughts.\n\nIt was a concrete block a couple of meters large with what looked like vents on the sides. As I looked into the vents, I noticed that they were also sealed with heavy-looking steel hatches and no clear way to open them. However, there was also a somewhat smaller door labeled “Service tunnel” with a large wheel on the outside.\n\n“Should I open it?” I asked.\n\n“Yeah, I’m really wonder what this is. Anyway, we don’t have to go in. At least we’ll see if the door still works.\n\nAt first, the wheel wouldn’t turn because of all the rust and dirt, but eventually it budged. The door unlocked. I pulled and it slowly started opening. It was very heavy and took a lot of force.\n\nBehind the door, there was a small platform and a tight vertical tunnel with a ladder. What caught my attention was that there was an identical locking mechanism on the inside. That meant that they could lock the door from both sides. But why? We were lucky, because if they had locked it from the inside too, there would be no way to get in.\n\nI stepped inside and shined my phone light down the shaft. It wasn’t strong enough to hit the bottom. The air was damp and old and there was something that I couldn’t identify. A very faint, chemical-like smell. There was no radiation nor signs of any other hazards.\n\n“You’ve got to be kidding me. This is so cool. We have to come back here and check it out later.” Alex said.\n\nI couldn’t agree more.\n\nIt was almost dark now, so we resealed the door and called it a day. But we promised ourselves to return.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI immediately tried to do some research when I got home, unfortunately with no success. I even tried to call Pavel, a friend of mine who knew the area better than me. Actually, it was him who brought me there for the first time. He couldn’t help me either, but promised to ask around. I told him about our plan and asked if he wouldn’t go with us, but unfortunately, he was out of the country for a while.\n\nA week later, we packed our gear and went on with it. We brought some rope, heavy flashlights, glowsticks, Geiger counters, waterproof protective clothes, an oxygen meter and a small emergency scuba tank just in case. And yeah, we’re not stupid so we told our relatives and friends about our trip and when we’re expecting to return.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe closed the door behind us as we descended down the access shaft. We couldn’t know what’s down there and we didn’t want to cause a radiation leak or something like that. We eventually dropped down into a concrete tunnel which enclosed the air vents and some smaller pipes. There was obviously no power and thus no lights. Good thing we brought our own.\n\nWe followed the tunnel and reached another door, but this time it was a regular one, not the heavy bunker-type. We went through and entered a room with 4 large air pumps and some electrical equipment and controls. The ventilation shafts split here into two larger ones that ran straight into ground and two smaller ones that went straight across the room where there was another set of doors.\n\nBehind the doors, there was a large hall with numerous boxes, crates and other cargo just laying around. There also was a security checkpoint. Behind the checkpoint, we found the main door that we have seen from the outside. Just next to it, there was some heavy lifting equipment. We returned through the checkpoint and taken a look at a set of elevators. There was a simple map with the layout of the facility floor by floor. We were on floor 0, main entry hall. There were another 4 floors below us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFloor -1: Offices, security and recreation\n\nFloor -2: Secure laboratories\n\nFloor -3: Accelerator, Cleanroom decontamination chamber\n\nFloor -4: Experiment site\n\nThe map was titled “Object-13”. It wasn’t a military bunker. This was a research site.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe took a set of stairs, since the elevators were of no use without power. An unsettling thought brushed my mind as we were descending. They probably were moving some supplies, and then left them there and took the equipment to the main door. Were they trying to get out?\n\nI stepped on another stair step but something rolled away under my foot, lost my balance and fell on my back. My pack luckily absorbed the impact. I looked under my feet to see what caused my fall. Empty bullet casings.\n\nThis wasn’t the sole reason why I felt odd about this place. As soon as we got down to level -1, I noticed that every single door was open. Every single one. There was a canteen and a kitchen right at the beginning of a long rectangular corridor. Various offices surrounded the corridor. There was the regular stuff – paperwork, old computers, personal belongings, all right there where they left it. Did they leave in a hurry?\n\n“Dimitri!” Alex called from, the canteen on the opposite side of the corridor.\n\n“What?” was all I could say when I followed him to the canteen.\n\nThere was food still neatly served on the tables. But it wasn’t spoilt. It wasn’t fresh either, but it wasn’t decaying, as a 30-year-old meal should.\n\n“How is this possible?” I asked.\n\n“I don’t know, maybe it was irradiated or something. But it’s not anymore, I checked that. I really don’t know man,” he answered, as puzzled as I was.\n\nOh, why didn’t we just turn back and leave? Now that I’m writing this, there were so many red flags already. Something really wrong happened down there. But I guess we were too excited and curious. But it was at this point that my excitement started to fade and be replaced with an eerie feeling.\n\nNevertheless, we continued and descended down to level -2. The stairwell ended here, and to go deeper, we would have to cross the entire floor to reach an another one on the opposite side. There was a security checkpoint and a large blast door that we had to pass through to reach the labs. Again, every door was wide open. However, the things that people left here weren’t neatly placed where they should have been. It was a mess everywhere. There were all kinds of rooms with all kinds of equipment that I didn’t understand. Occasionally, there were more empty bullet casings on the ground. There still was the one central rectangular corridor as above, but the rooms around it were like a little maze.\n\nAlmost at the other side of the floor, we found the head scientist’s office. As I said, everywhere it was a mess, but I found a logbook on the desk. There was only a handful of pages, the rest torn out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5. October 1984:** Today we successfully managed to translocate several atoms without changes in any physical properties. It’s going to be a long road until we can transport solid objects, but we’re going some good work here.\n\n**17. January 1985:** We’ve managed to transport an apple today. However, I couldn’t help but notice that the pattern of red and green skin on top was slightly different. But it was still the same apple, with the same structure, shape, everything. We also tried to transport some electronics. They were unharmed and in working order. I think that we still have a lot to perfect and learn about this technology, but we cannot slow down now. The country is relying on us.\n\n**21. February 1985:** After the animal trials, we translocated our first human today. He is alive and healthy, a brave hero of our nation. We have proven that this technology works now, but the practicality is still very limited due to the fixed translocation ratio. We still cannot “send” matter. Only exchange the positions of two equally massive objects. I have proposed a new type of device, that could possibly achieve one-way translocation of just a single object, but it would need an immense amount of energy.\n\n**1. May 1985:** Our superiors accepted my proposal. They are going to build a new, much bigger translocator here, in the power plant, so we can use a nuclear reactor as a direct power source. There is one more thing. We’ve now translocated dozens of test subjects. Each one is alive and well, but sometimes they are a little bit, well, different. They sometimes claim that various events in the past happened differently than they really did. Sometimes they claim to know people who don’t exist, or more alarming, they know people who they are not supposed to know. The following was written below with a pencil by hand: “Test subject 28 was speaking an unknown language and couldn’t understand any real language after the experiment.”\n\nThere was a lot of missing pages afterwards.\n\n**25. April 1986:** We are going to try to change our approach. It’s been more than a year, and we’re still unsuccessful in eliminating the translocation symmetry anomaly. We still event don’t know what is causing it, but we are not going to make any progress this way. Today, we are going to try to access the conduit reality instead.  Even though Unit 2 - the one we built in the power plant - is still new, we are going to use it for this experiment. Who knows what wonders are waiting for us on the other side?\n\nThere was one last page in the logbook. On it, it was just a single phrase, written again and again:\n\n# “WE LET THEM IN”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Alex, I think we should go,” I called.\n\n“Man, come take a look at this,” he answered.\n\nI stepped out of the lab and back into the hallway.\n\nThere were … clothes all over the corridor. Well what was left of them. They were torn to shreds. No bodies, no blood, just strips of cloth and an occasional shoe or a watch.  I looked up and stared down the dark corridor in front of us. I just stood there for a while.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was, I don't know ... as if something torn all these people to shreds, and then cleaned it all up. Except the clothes and other non-organic material.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA wave of pure, instinctive dread washed over me. I couldn’t move. I didn’t even breathe.\n\n“Let’s just get out of here.” Alex said.\n\nWe turned around and walked away. Slowly at first, but we quickened our pace. Our footsteps echoed across the underground structure.\n\n“I just want to be out of here man. We shouldn’t have done this” Alex said. I didn’t tell him about the logbook, but…\n\nMy thoughts were cut short after a sudden realization.\n\nHis voice didn’t echo. It was just our footsteps.\n\nI think he realized too, because we both stopped and listened.\n\nNothing. Just silence.\n\nI stepped forward.\n\n*Clack.*\n\nI took another step.\n\n*Clack.*\n\nThere was this door just in front of us and I forced myself to try something. I closed it behind us as we passed it and placed a glass beaker that I found on the ground on top.\n\nI took a step forward.\n\nSilence\n\nIt was just echo after all, I thought.\n\nWe walked away, carefully at first, but then we once again quickened our pace. We turned around a corner, and then it happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Crash*\n\nThe glass shattered.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSomeone\n\nor some thing\n\n&#x200B;\n\njust opened the door.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe dropped all our gear except our lights and ran as fast as we could. I didn’t even know I could run this fast. I always tried to be a tough guy but I was never so scared in my life.\n\nOur footsteps didn’t echo anymore. Or better said, they weren’t in sync with ours anymore. Something was running after us. Each second it was getting closer. And closer.\n\nAs soon as we reached the security checkpoint, we started closing the door. The rusty joint of the door squealed in protest, but we pulled with all our strength. We almost had it closed, when we heard a loud, guttural and unnatural growl.\n\nThe door slammed shut and I threw the wheel to the ‘locked’ position. My heart was pounding so hard that it was all I heard for a while.\n\nNo, wait, it wasn’t my heart. It was that thing, pounding on the locked blast door.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe were running again. We reached the stairwell and run up, taking 2-3 steps at once.\n\nWe finally reached the air pump room. The ascent really exhausted us and even though I was scared shitless, I felt like I would pass out if I took another step forward. Besides, we locked it down there.\n\nAlex sat down and leaned his back on one of the large vertical vents with a bang.\n\n*Bang. Bang. Bang…*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh fuck.\n\nWe locked it down there.\n\nBut we forgot the vents.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlex and I looked at each other, our eyes met, and then… the vent burst and he was gone. I only heard him scream as he was dragged back down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel terrible for doing this, but I just ran, I climbed the service shaft and locked the service door shut when I was finally out of this hell.\n\nAs soon as I had phone service again, my phone started beeping with loads and loads of missed calls and messages from Pavel.\n\n“Hey Dimitri, I found this guy, he says he knows what ‘O-13’ is. Please pick up as soon as you can, he says it’s dangerous and you should stay out of it.\n\n“This guy is calling me now, he sounds serious, please call me back at once”\n\n“I don’t know what’s going on but he’s going there, please I hope you get this before you go down. Stay safe friend.”\n\nThere was also one message from an unknown number:\n\n“Dimitri, this is Anatoliy Moroz, I know what you found and I’m on my way from Kiev now. DO NOT GO DOWN THERE. If you already did and you manage to get out, lock the door that you used to get in and make sure it stays locked. I will try to call you when I’m here.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here I am, writing this while I wait. I do this to make sure that no one else repeats our mistake, since I don’t know if I’ll live long to tell anyone personally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just can’t leave Alex behind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have to go back.\n\n# [Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/c090ig\/the_chernobyl_disaster_was_a_coverup_of_something\/)"},"250":{"title":"My job is watching a woman trapped in a room.

I rolled back to the desk and sat there, trying to stop from shaking, trying to make myself take a breath.  Think about it slow.  The first thing was, should I hit a button?\n\nThe red button was for an emergency.  If she *was* a prisoner or something, and she was trying to escape, they might think that was an emergency.  But no one had been hurt that I knew of.  And I think Mr. Solomon meant save that for something that was like a police or ambulance emergency, not something like this.  But what about the green button?\n\nThis was definitely something “noteworthy”.  Not only that she was asking for help, but that she was asking *me* for help.  \n\nI made myself stop for a moment.  I couldn’t know for sure she was asking me.  I had gone to school with several boys named Thomas.  It was a common name.  But the chances of her painting that name when I was working here?  I didn’t want to be silly, but I wasn’t trying to be too…what’s that word.  Mom used to say it when she read her angel books.  Skeptics.  I didn’t want to be a skeptic either.  I had to believe it was probably meant for me.  And that was something they would want to know.\n\nBut should I hit the green button?  My hands were drifting toward the metal box on the desk, but I hesitated.  I didn’t like breaking rules, and I was scared of what would happen if I broke these.  If they really were holding her prisoner, then they were probably very bad people.  But I didn’t know that.  Maybe they were good and *she* was bad.  But I just…\n\nI looked back at the monitor for the first time since reading the words.  Rachel was already moving the paintings back off the sofa, as though she knew the message had been received.  A canvas in each hand, she glanced up at the camera as she moved across the room, and it felt like she was looking right at me.  My chest tightened as my hands moved away from the buttons.  \n\nNo.  I didn’t think she was bad.  I had watched her for years.  I felt like I knew her, would know if she was bad.  Strange as it seemed, in a way she was my friend.  And I was going to try and help her.\n\n**** \n\nI spent the rest of my shift trying to act normal and think of what to do.  I knew whoever else was watching might have noticed the paintings or seen how I acted, but I couldn’t worry about that.  I would try to play it cool and try to think how I could help her.\n\nThe only people I had actually met connected to this job were a couple of people when I filled out the papers and then Mr. Solomon when he showed me the model room and told me the job.  I had no way of contacting any of them except through the buttons.  My checks were deposited electronically and I had never run into anyone else who worked at the surveillance room.\n\nThat thought made me stop a second.  I had always thought it was weird that I never ran into someone when I was coming or going—the person I was taking over for or the person who was taking over for me.  I had always figured there must be other people, other surveillance rooms even, and they just scheduled us so we didn’t run into each other.  And I still thought there were others.\n\nPart of why I thought that was because it seemed like I wasn’t the only person who used my surveillance room.  The water cooler, the toilet paper, the soap, they all seemed go down faster than I think I was using it by myself.  If that was true, maybe I could figure out who they were, and maybe they would be safer to talk to than whoever it was that I worked for.\n\nI got off work at eight that night, and instead of grabbing some food and going home, I drove my car around the block and then parked down the street from the building where I worked.  Nothing had changed while I drove around for a minute—no new cars had parked or anything—and if I was right, they didn’t send anyone to replace me until they were sure I was gone anyhow.  \n\nSo I sat and waited.\n\nI was tired and the street was pretty empty and boring, but I was too excited and scared to fall sleep.  Every time a car passed or someone walked down the sidewalk, I tensed.  I kept imagining a SUV or van pulling up behind me.  Men getting out and pulling me from my car, taking me somewhere like where they had Rachel to kill or torture me.  Half a dozen times I almost cranked up and drove away, but every time I would think of her alone in that room.  She had no one but me to help her, and I had to try.\n\nTwo hours later, a fat balding man parked and started heading for the building.  As soon as I saw he was able to unlock the door and enter, I opened my car door to go talk to him.  Then I stopped.  I needed to be smart.  I didn’t know where they were, but I was sure there were hidden cameras in the locker room and outside the building.  If I go running in there and confront that guy, they’ll know for sure that I’m up to something.\n\nSighing with frustration, I shut the door back and waited until his shift was over.  I considered tailing him like in the movies, but I was scared I would just lose him or he would call someone for help.  So I waited until he was walking back to his car after a six hour shift, hopefully far enough away that the cameras wouldn’t see.  And then I met the man I came to know as Charles Jefferies.\n\n**** \n\n“Hey…Hey, man, can I talk to you for a minute?”   His back was to me and he just waved his hand absently without looking up.\n\n“Sorry, I don’t have any money.  Have a good…”  He froze as he glanced back at me while talking.  “Oh God.  No.  No.  You need to get out of here, kid.  We aren’t allowed to talk.”  I could tell he was scared, but I couldn’t risk letting him go yet, not after all this.  I stepped up and pushed the door back shut as he was trying to get into his car.\n\n“So you know who I am?”  I tried to not sound mean, but I could hear how mad I was in my voice.\n\nHe yanked at the door again, but I was still holding it, and I was stronger than he was.  After a second, weaker tug, he turned around, his face strained and tired-looking.  “Yeah, I know who you are.  You work here just like me.  And I’m telling you, we aren’t supposed to be talking.  We aren’t supposed to meet, ever.”\n\nI frowned.  “Mr. Solomon never told me that.  He never said it was one of the rules.”\n\nThe man shook his head.  “Mr. Solomon.  Yeah.  Well there are plenty of rules they don’t tell you.  I bet they didn’t tell you what you were going to be watching before you started, did they?”  When I just lowered my eyes, he went on.  “Yeah, me either.  I’ve been at this job for ten years.  I’ve seen other people come and go, usually because they broke one those rules they never mentioned.  The only reason I’m still here is because I keep my head down and my mouth shut.”  He wagged a finger at me.  “You should do the same, if it’s not already too late.”\n\nI felt my stomach curling into a cold knot.  “Too late?”\n\nThe man rubbed his face.  “Kid, do you think they don’t know we’re talking?  Do you think anything happens that they don’t know about?”  He looked back toward the building, a look of sadness and fear in his eyes.  “Hell, for all I know, you’ve already killed us both.”  Shaking his head, he pushed me back and started opening the door.  “Either way, I’m done risking it.  You need to stop asking questions and just do your job.  It’s a lot healthier.”\n\nWith that, he got into his car and shut the door.  I didn’t try to stop him this time.  Even though I had already been worried about what he was telling me, hearing it confirmed was paralyzing.  What exactly was my plan?  He probably didn’t know any more than I did, and even if he did, what could I do with anything he told me?\n\nI walked back to my car with a heavy heart.  I was still afraid, but more than that, I was sad and ashamed.  I wanted to help Rachel, but I wasn’t sure how.  I wasn’t giving up, but as I drove back to my apartment, I couldn’t think of what I should do next.  This wasn’t a movie.  I wasn’t a hero.  And the only ideas I had left were to either go to the police, who might be controlled by whoever I worked for, or try to get proof of her being held prisoner myself.\n\nAs I parked my car and walked into my apartment building, I made a decision.  Unless I thought of something better overnight, I would do both ideas.  Tomorrow I would break the rule about carrying anything in.  I’d use my phone to record a video of the surveillance room, of Rachel and how she was trapped somewhere, and of me telling everything else I knew.  And I would email it to every newspaper, website, and internet channel I could think of.  I’d then go to the police and give them a copy too if I could make it that long without getting caught.  Maybe if I did all that, even if they got me, someone would help Rachel.\n\nI was filled with worry and dread at the idea of being hurt or killed.  A part of me kept saying I should just do as I was told and hope that it all went away.  But I couldn’t live with myself if I did that.  Even if I messed up, I felt like I had to try.  I was so preoccupied that I didn’t hear the person coming up behind me as I unlocked my apartment door.\n\n“Thomas?”\n\nI turned around and felt my legs weaken as I stumbled back against my door.  I had to be dreaming or crazy.  I grabbed the door knob for support as I looked at the woman in front of me.  It couldn’t be her, but somehow it was.\n\n[“Rachel?”](https:\/\/redd.it\/9ndww5)\n\n****\n\n[Part Three](https:\/\/redd.it\/bsg2az)"},"251":{"title":"They paid me $5000 to go through hell","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/fjma9t\/they_paid_me_5000_to_go_through_hell\/","flair":null,"author":"Jaksim","selftext":"It was the advertisement’s outright simplicity that caught my attention.\n\n“Revolutionize science! Earn $5000! Call us now!”\n\nI wish I could say I didn’t know why I called them. I wish I could say it was some act of God or deception that drove me into their waiting arms. But that would be a lie. The truth is I called them because I needed the money. Because I had gotten laid off at the publishing company I worked at and I was having trouble finding steady work. Because I was months behind on rent and facing my second eviction notice. Because I didn’t want to be a failure.\n\nI called them for selfish reasons.\n\nWho are they? I’m not exactly sure. In retrospect, their obvious obfuscation of their identity should have been a red flag to me. But at the time, their request seemed too interesting, their reward too vital, for me to risk losing the chance to help them. My best guess is that they’re a group of private researchers that are funded by some super-corporation. They must be. Otherwise, there was no way they would have been able to pay for the machine.\nThey showed me the machine the first time I met with them. It was kept in a cavernous room in the basement of a five-story office building. It was a work in progress at that time – they were still connecting pipes and soldering wires. But even in an unfinished state, it looked truly magnificent.\n\n“Have you ever heard of a sensory deprivation chamber?”\n\nI had. In fact, I had actually been inside one before, when I was in college. Back then, I was on a real hippy-dippy spiritual journey. You know, meditating a lot, experimenting with psychedelic drugs. Primarily magic mushrooms. At some point along that journey, I felt motivated to spend an hour of my life (and sixty dollars of my student loans) inside a sensory deprivation chamber at a local spa.\nYour standard sensory deprivation chamber is a large metal tank filled with about a foot of salt water. You step in and float in the water, then someone (a spa attendant, in my case) closes off the tank so it’s completely dark. With your vision obscured and your body suspended in the water, it’s supposed to feel like you no longer have your two primary senses. Depending on who you ask, this is supposed to be relaxing, enhance your creative process, allow you to reach higher consciousness, hallucinate, or maybe gain magic powers.\n\nMy experience with the chamber in college was fairly lackluster. I remember that the water was too frigid and the salt made my skin itch. It was difficult to concentrate on meditating or channeling my inner chakra or whatever the spa had promised. Truthfully, I did always wonder what it would have been like to get in one of those things while tripping on some magic mushrooms, but I never had the opportunity.\nThis sensory deprivation chamber didn’t look anything like the one I used in college. This chamber looked like a vivisected suit of medieval armor strewn across a large metal table. Thousands of tubes and wires connected to the metal body, which was about three times larger than my own body. The head or “helmet” of the chamber was collosal and round with a big brass pipe running out of its crown into the tiled-floor beneath it. On the walls surrounding the chamber were fifty or sixty computer screens, twenty or so server boxes, and various iterations of medical equipment that I couldn’t name if I tried. \n\nIt dawns on me now that the utility bills and computers alone for the machine must have been many tens of times higher than the measly $5000 they offered me, not to mention the salaries of the dozens of labcoat-clad scientists manning those computer screens. Again, perhaps this should have raised alarm bells, but I ignored it with the focused ignorance of a man who was on the brink of homelessness.\nThe man who showed me the machine told me his name was Dr. Monason. He was a wrinkled, balding man with a clean shave and focused eyes of blue. When I saw him, he was always clad in blue scrubs and a clean white labcoat. \n\nDr. Monason was the primary liaison for my involvement on this project. He explained the machine’s purpose, brought me the necessary waivers, and answered all my questions.\n\nQuestions like, “So what exactly am I supposed to do?”\n\n“We want you to remain in our sensory deprivation chamber for three days.”\n\nI’m sure my expression betrayed my sense of shock. \n\n“Three days? Is that – I mean will – Will that kill me?”\n\n“You probably would still be alive after three days in pure isolation, though you would likely become gravely ill and suffering from immense dehydration. Regardless, the machine will hydrate, feed, and otherwise sustain you during the experiment. So there is no risk of bodily harm.”\n\nDr. Monason went on to explain how the machine worked.\n\n“In your standard deprivation chamber, the occupant is deprived of their sense of sight, feeling, and, to a lesser extent, hearing. This deprivation, this process of shutting the outside world out from the occupant’s mind, decreases the burden on their brain. Thus, the occupant’s mind is free to wander more freely – free to think more creatively, to undergo a deeper state of thinking, to meditate, and so on.\n\n“But there is a problem with standard sensory deprivation chambers. Although the brain is freed from most external stimuli, the visual and auditory, the brain will continue to be burdened by internal stimuli. That is to say that the brain is still very aware of its own carrier – the human body. The brain will still react to the hunger and thirst of the vessel that carries it. It will still process both the need to and the action of urination and defecation. These internal interruptions go on and on, but the point is that standard sensory deprivation chambers cannot truly be said to deprive the occupant of their senses.\n\n“This machine is not your standard sensory deprivation chamber.”\n\nEven a cursory glance at the machine made clear what the doctor meant. \n\n“The inside of the exoskeleton portion of the machine is lined with a soft rubber that will acclimate to maintain the exact temperature of human skin. The tubes and wires control and regulate a wide variety of bodily functions. Through these tubes, the body is automatically fed and hydrated. The unsavory functions of the body are handled with a catheter and another series of tubes. A respirator automates breathing and regulates saliva production.\n\n“Even the body’s natural sense of touch is completely removed while in the machine. This IV cord injects a numbing solution into the bloodstream that completely shuts off all feeling. The numbing agent is the most critical asset of our sensory deprivation process.”\n\nThe list went on and on. It became clear that they had truly accounted for everything.\n\nEven for me. I was one of hundreds of applicants to be part of the experiment. For the first time in my life, I was the first round draft pick. The scientists explained to me that I had been chosen for three reasons.\n\nNumber one: I had no prior history of mental or physical illness that would make my experience in the chamber subject to “intervening variables.” Their words, not mine.\n\nNumber two: My height and weight were close matches for the machine’s original shape. \n\n“Although the legs will have to be lengthened ever so slightly, you are by far the closest match to our initial design.”\n\nAnd number three, the most critical: There was nothing happening outside of that chamber that would lead to an early termination of the experiment. I had no significant other, no job, no living family members – not even a houseplant to take care of. They could breathe easy knowing that I would remain peacefully within their contraption for the entire length of the experiment.\n\nNumber three was important to the scientists. They had specifically designed the machine to allow for three full days of isolation. If the machine’s process had to be interrupted early, it would take them a month to reset the machine and run the experiment again. \n\nUnfortunately, reason number three also meant there was nobody to come looking for me.\n\nThe intake process was long and detailed. I signed what felt like hundreds of liability waivers. I listened to warning after warning about the potential side effects.\n\n“Although it is apparent that you have a clean bill of health, you should be aware the isolation process may be taxing on you. Our preliminary research suggests that disassociation, audio and visual hallucinations, depression, time dilation, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, and other neuroses are potential effects. However, we believe such effects to be unlikely.”\n\nThey had given me several weeks to prepare for the experiment. My only requirement during that time was that I didn’t substantially change my bodyweight or somehow develop bipolar disorder. Somehow, I managed. I spent those few weeks living normally – watching movies, applying for jobs, getting rejected for those jobs, and reading a few books.\n\nWhen the day came, I was nervous despite Dr. Monason’s efforts to prepare me.\n\n“The process will come in stages. At first, you may endure a mild state of stress. We anticipate that soon after, you will drift into a moderate state of euphoria for the remainder of the process. You will be signaled a few minutes before the experiment is over by a short audio queue. This way, you will emerge from your state of sensory deprivation slowly and be able to re-acclimate without any risk of shock.”\n\nHe played the audio queue for me, which was a short musical clip of bells ringing. \nThen, with little ceremony or deliberation, I was asked to asked to remove my clothing and climb inside the machine.\n\nAs I lay down inside the exoskeleton, I felt the warm rubber against my bare skin. Even with the chamber still open, I was confined on all sides by the metal shell of the machine. Slowly, the researchers began to attach a score of medical devices to my body. I felt strangely calm through every prick of an IV and uncomfortable insertion of a tube.\nBut, as a respirator was placed on my face, I began to feel a foreboding sense of unease. As I felt my body being constricted and held in place a single thought filled my mind.\n\nOh God what have I done.\n\nThe researchers pushed the helmet of the exoskeleton inward on either side of my head, sealing off my ears. The world went quiet. A bead of sweat began to trickle down my sides. Then I heard a voice, seemingly broadcast from inside my own head.\n“Hello. This is Dr. Monason. I am speaking to you via a small speaker contained within the helmet of the exoskeleton. Your vital signs indicate that you are beginning to panic. This is to be expected. Please do your best to relax while we finish preparing you. I promise that the process will become pleasurable soon enough.”\n\nSomehow telling me to relax just made me more anxious. Before I could react, I felt the machine close around my body. Already the numbing agent that was being piped into my bloodstream was starting to take away control of my extremities. I tried to push against the machine but found that my arms wouldn’t budge. I tried to scream but the respirator held my tongue firmly in place. I was unable to move, unable to do anything.\n\nExcept watch.\n\nI could still watch as researchers scrambled around me to check vitals and prepare the exoskeleton to finish closing. I could still watch as a giant analog timer appeared on a tv screen above me and began to broadcast a time.\n\n00:00:01:00 Until Deprivation Begins.\n\nI tried again to scream. I tried again to plead to be let out. I found myself unable to feel any part of my body. I strained my eyes to try and get someone’s attention but no one seemed to be looking at me.\n\n00:00:00:30 Until Deprivation Begins.\n\nHad my tear ducts been operating, I would have begun crying.  Without nothing else to do, I began to pray that this was a bad dream. To pray that I was home in bed and not in this chamber.\n\n00:00:00:05 Until Deprivation Begins.\n\nThe last thing I saw was the face of Dr. Monason leaning over me. Waving to me. Saying something I couldn’t quite understand. Closing the exoskeleton’s face over my own.\n\n00:00:00:00 Until Deprivation Begins.\n\nAnd then everything went dark.\n\n\nIf I had been in control of my own breathing, I would have begun hyperventilating immediately. \n\nI had never felt such a profound sense of darkness as in that moment. Unable to see even my own body, it was as if I had been extinguished from existence. My eyes swam in every direction in search of a single iota of light but found none.\n\nAfter a moment’s consideration, I realized that I had now been in the machine for some time. I had no reference point for exactly how long. Without outside stimuli of any kind, my only mechanism of telling time was by counting individual seconds in my head.\n\nYet time ticked on. I found myself alternating between obsessing about my imprisonment and finding myself adrift in my thoughts. \n\nI began to consider the state of my life. My recent unemployment. My lack of close friends. I felt a wave of depression come over me. Was my life really so meaningless that I could be snuffed out of existence for three days and no one could possibly care?\n\nI pondered the source of my isolation. I looked back to times I could have tried harder at my job. Images of friendships that I had let fall apart out of introversion and stagnation cascaded through my mind. \nAnd then I came across a thought in my head that, were my body not numbed to the point of immobility, would have made me burst out into laughter.\n\nI felt lonely.\n\nWell, of course, I felt lonely. I was, at that moment, the most alone human being there had ever been. Surely there were researchers only a few feet from my terrestrial body, but my mind had been isolated completely. I was as alone as someone could be.\n\nI let my mind continue to wander. It felt as though I had been in the chamber for hours at this point. Although I had planned to spend this time planning some sort of creative endeavor – the great American novel, perhaps – I found my mind repeatedly coming back to my current predicament. \n\nObsessively, I thought about my body and the container that currently housed it. The numbing medicine must have been truly quite something. I couldn’t feel the slightest wisp of breath passing through my nasal cavities or the rumble of my stomach.\n\nIt was then that a pair of intertwining thoughts collided in my mind.\n\nA: Could I be dead?\n\nB: No, of course not. That would be ridiculous. \n\nI knew how I had ended up here – I knew that I had signed up to engage in an experiment that would put me in this exact predicament. But I must admit, I no longer felt very alive. Without my body or the surrounding world as a reference point, it felt as though I had no assurance that I still existed. My thoughts began dueling with one another.\n\nA: Surely I’m not dead. This is exactly what the experiment was supposed to do.\n\nB: If you’re not dead then why can’t you feel anything? Why can’t you feel your breath or saliva or ANYTHING?\n\nA: But I know I’m not dead because I’m thinking right now.\n\nB: What does that mean?\n\nA: You know? I think, therefore I am.\n\nI think, therefore I am. A smarter man could have told you who said that. But I was left with just that proclamation, from an unknown source, as the only assurance that I was alive. As long as I was thinking, I was still alive.\n\nI began to picture myself floating through a void in space. The image was clear in front of my eyes. My body lay flat, my arms stiff, as I rocketed past stars and unfamiliar planets. I watched my body weave past asteroids and through planetary rings. I felt the warmth of the sun on my body and the cold ice of the frozen planets on my skin.\n\nExcept I didn’t really feel those things. I had to remind myself of that. I was starting to imagine feelings that weren’t really there. I wasn’t sure how much I should try to avoid these feelings or just embrace them for the duration of the experiment. Just another question to ponder, I suppose.\n\nThere came a time when I realized that I had been in sensory deprivation for a long time. Since I had not been counting, it was impossible to know how long. It felt like it had been days already.\n\nHad it been days already?\n\nThat was a worrying thought. In a timeless void, three days stretched on like an endless millennium. \n\nThey had assured me that I would only be inside the machine for three days. But how could I know for sure? Once I was inside, I had no way of getting out. They could keep me for as long as they wanted to. Maybe that was their plan all along. \n\nA: How could they get away with that? \n\nB: Who knows what all those liability waivers I signed said. I stopped reading them after the third or fourth one. Maybe I agreed to this. \n\nA: You’re being crazy.\n\nB: I don’t know if I’m being crazy or not. I don’t know how long I’ve been in here.\n\nA: So count!\n\nThat was right. I had one way to tell how long I had been inside the machine. Counting.\n\nOne.\n\nTwo.\n\nThree.\n\nFour.\n\nFive.\n\nAnd on and on. I counted to 60. That was a minute. And then I counted another minute. And another and another and another. I just kept going and going. I never lost focus on the task at hand.\nThen I hit 1000 minutes. Technically, 1000 minutes was only a little more than 16 and a half hours. Certainly not the three-day period I was supposed to be inside the machine. \n\nBut that was 16 and a half hours on top of all the time I had already spent thinking about my life and dreaming about floating through space. Surely I had spent longer thinking to myself than I had counting.\n\nI tried to guess how long I had been in the machine. It felt like it had been more than three days. I just kept trying to tell myself that I would be let out of the machine soon.\n\nI let my mind drift off again. \n\nMy body was once again floating through space. I watched it drift farther and farther out into an endless void of darkness. The planets and suns shrunk into oblivion until I was truly, deeply alone. \nIn the black abyss, a creeping feeling of cold began to set in. Its biting sting spread up my legs and torso to my face. My naked skin turned a pale blue and begun to harden into a crystalline husk. As my body drifted farther into darkness, I watched the surface of my stomach crack and chip. \n\nSlowly, chunks of my body began to break off and float into the darkness. With each expelled scrap of flesh, a new wave of pain cascaded through my body. I found myself trying to grab onto my frozen body and put it back together, but my arms and legs were so cold that I could not budge. I tried to scream but my tongue had swelled so large that it filled my crumbling, frigid mouth.\nAll at once, my body exploded into an array of jagged, bloody shards of ice. The pain was indescribable.\n\nThen I was, again, alone in the darkness. Bodiless. Without lungs to expel the panicked breaths I was so desperate to create. I had to keep telling myself – it wasn’t real. I’m still alive. My body is still here, somewhere.\n\nA: But god, didn’t it feel real?\n\nB: But it wasn’t real.\n\nA: Real or not, didn’t it hurt?\n\nB: Yes.\n\nA: Are you scared?\n\nB: Yes.\n\n. . .\n\nA: Wait. Do you hear that?\n\nI listened through ears that were a million miles away. A voice – not mine own – burst into my head. Its bristly accent was familiar.\n\n“Hello! This is Dr. Monason. I’m contacting you again via the small speakers contained within the helmet of the exoskeleton. I am proud to announce that you have successfully completed three days within the machine.”\n\nI felt my alarm melt quickly into relief. I tried to smile, to little avail.\n\n“At this juncture, we would like to update you as to the status of our experiment. The data we’re getting from your brain scans is proving incredibly useful. The medical implications are numerous. We have contacted our institutional review board and obtained permission to extend the experiment indefinitely. This is, of course, in accordance with the liability waivers that you’ve signed previously. The machine should be able to keep you alive for a few more weeks until your body becomes unable to support it any further. Do not worry, $5000 will nonetheless be credited into your account. Thank you for your contribution. Your sacrifice will save lives.”\n\nI tried to scream. I tried to flail my arms in protest and push back against the doctor’s words but my screams were silent and my arms no longer part of me.\n\nI felt a deep, echoing hole of dread grow inside me. Yet I would never truly feel anything again.\n\nI would die in this chamber. It would take days. And those days would feel like months. And those months would be torture. \n\nI again saw myself floating in an immeasurable darkness. There were no stars or planets. There was only my body. Unequivocally alone. Arguably alive, but inevitably dead.\n\nI stopped counting the seconds and just let myself float.\n\n--\n\nMy mind wandered again, this time for much longer. I dreamt of my childhood and of a future I would never get to lead. I made an imaginary bucket list and felt remorse for the boxes I had not yet checked. I held conversations in my head between old friends and lovers. \n\nAnd sometimes, I didn’t think at all. Sometimes I disappeared from existence altogether.\n\nBut then I felt it. I felt something. I couldn’t tell what it was at first. It had been so long since I felt something that I couldn’t tell if I was imagining it or not.\n\nIt was my big toe. My big toe on my right foot. Somehow, someway, it still had feeling. Not a lot of feeling – it felt like when you sit on your hand and it becomes almost, but not quite, numb. Like it was being massaged by a set of pins and needles.\n\nI moved the toe around, the little that I could, to try to understand how this feeling had come back.\n\nThen I felt it – a tiny prick. The slightest droplet of pain against my big toe. Something sharp.\n\nAn IV needle.\n\nIt must have become dislodged somehow. Maybe one of those labcoat-wearing schmucks tripped over it or something. All I knew was that I could feel again. I suddenly felt like I had been born again. Like I had died and risen from the ashes.\n\nThis needle must have been one of the needles that was supposed to deliver the numbing chemical into my body. Somehow, it got dislodged and now I had just a little feeling in my toe. Unfortunately, my big toe was hardly the vestige of my body most suited to orchestrate my grand escape. \n\nBut still, I felt immeasurable happiness. Because I had a secret weapon on my side. \n\nTime. There’s an old adage that goes “If you give a monkey a typewriter and infinite time, he will eventually write the complete works of Shakespeare”. Similarly, with a partially numb big toe and infinite time to think, I could craft my grand escape.\n\nMy big toe was too weak to push open the exoskeleton. Despite my straining, I was unable to reach any other cords to pull them out. All I could reach was the IV needle that had already been pulled out.\nAnd with that IV needle, I hatched my plan. I scraped my toe across it. It stung, but I knew it would do the trick. I knew that I had forced those stupid scientists’ hands. My efforts had made a cut in my toe-skin. And now I knew I was going to be okay.\n\nThey only had two options. Let me bleed out, in which case I would at least be free from this hell, or let me out of the chamber, at least long enough to reattach the IV. Either way, my plan was foolproof. Either way, I was going to be free, at least for a moment.\n\nIt only took them a few minutes to notice what I had done.\n\n--\n\n“This is Dr. Monason again, communicating via the tiny speaker in the helmet of the exoskeleton. It seems you have managed to injure yourself inside the exoskeleton. After some discussion, we have elected to pause the experiment and correct the error. Stand by – the exoskeleton will be opening shortly.”\n\nThe light that soon flooded my eyes all but blinded me. As the machine opened, I bathed in the sounds of its electronic thunks and whirs and the conversation of the men around me. The quick tug as needles and tube were removed from me felt better than any touch I had ever experienced.\n\nThey let me out. I was free.\n\nMy body was numb for hours. The medicine prevented me from making any movements, at all. During that time, the scientists left me in the exoskeleton as they went over data and bandaged my big toe. I tried to listen to everything they were saying but found myself unable to concentrate. The bright lights above me burned my eyes, which had grown accustomed to perfect darkness.\n\nAs the drugs slowly left my body, a dull ache developed in my joints. After a while, my body was hauled out of the exoskeleton by a team of the labcoats. I felt a dressing gown slip on over my head. I was plopped into a wheelchair. Still unable to move, I listened to the roll of metal wheels as they pushed that chair deeper and deeper into their lab.\n\n--\n\n“Explain again about when you were floating through space. What was the sensation like?”\n\n“Please let me go!”\n\n “I can’t. You know that. The data we were getting from you is too important. Lives are at stake. And besides that, we can’t risk you going to the police. You will be going back in the machine.”\n\nThis conversation had been going on for about an hour in the tiny interrogation room set up somewhere in the research group’s massive underground lab. Although I had regained enough feeling to speak, I still found movement quite difficult. It was clear that as soon as I outlived my usefulness to the lab coats I was going to be placed back inside the machine until my bodily demise. The data that the scientists had gained so far was so useful that they had no problem holding me against my will.\n\nAs I sat in that tiny metal room, tied to cold folding chair, clad only in a thin dressing gown, I considered my fate. For $5000 I had sold away the rest of my life. My only respite now was that I could delay going back in the machine for as long as I resisted Dr. Monason’s questioning. But I knew I was just delaying the inevitable.\n\nI stared down at my big toe, now wrapped in a bandage. Somehow it had not dawned on me that, even if I got out of the machine, the scientists were unlikely to let me out of the building alive. Not after they decided to imprison me until I died, anyway.\n\n“What if I don’t answer the questions?”\n\n“The data we intend to receive from those questions is critical and could save lives. But if we cannot illicit it, then the information received from the exoskeleton will be sufficient. If you won’t answer, we will return you to the machine now.”\n\nSo it didn’t matter. I was already doomed. I might as well delay for as long as I could.\n\n“Fine. Ask me what you want to ask me.”\n\nI answered hundreds of questions, most of them multiple times. It took hours. The scientists barely listened to my words. There was a recorder placed in the room with me. I’m sure someone would dig through my answers later, but for now the conversation seemed to be mostly for posterity’s sake.\n\nAt some point though, I realized something. The drugs had completely left my body. I could, theoretically, move again. For now, I was tied to a chair. But they couldn’t keep me tied up if they wanted me to go back into the machine.\n\nAnd from that thought, I came up with a plan. I knew I would only have a few seconds. I knew I couldn’t run immediately, or they would catch me. I would have to convince them I was resigned to my fate.\nWhen the questioning concluded, I found myself being hauled back into the chamber containing the exoskeleton. Perhaps assuming that I would flee otherwise, the scientists kept me tied up during transit.\n\nBut the ties came off when it was time to put me in the machine. They stripped off my night gown and lifted me inside the machine. I let my body go limp as they did – feigning the same numbness that had, until recently, restricted my movement. As I laid down in the rubber interior of the exoskeleton, Dr. Monason spoke to me through a loudspeaker in the ceiling. \n\n“I am sorry we have to part again. Your answers will be invaluable for future research. I know it may seem now like we are villains. But the research we’re obtaining is invaluable. It will save lives someday. You are doing a valuable service to the world.”\n\nAs his speech ended, his researchers again approached to fill my body with needles and tubes. I was eager to make my escape but I held tight. They would have to believe I was unable to move.\n\nI felt pinpricks in my right arm. I was already being loaded up with the numbing agent. My time was going to be short. As some of the labcoats approached me on my left side to insert another IV, I launched myself upward so I was standing inside the machine. Surprised by my sudden motion, the scientists on my left recoiled. I felt a sharp pain in my right arm as the IVs and tubes held tight against the strain of my sudden motion.\n\nThe room exploded into panic. Men rushed at me from all sides. I felt my body moving as if on its own volition. My left arm reached towards my right and ripped a series of cords and needles out of my body. Blood sprayed onto the machine. My right arm fell loosely to my side.\n\nI propelled myself out of the machine and onto the floor, naked as the day I was born. The numbing agent had disabled my right arm, but most of my body was fine. I sprinted towards the door through which I had entered the lab, what now seemed like a millennium ago. I did not dare turn back to see if I was being chased. All I could do was run.\n\nAs I pushed the door open, I saw a long hallway that led to a set of alternating staircases. Staircases that I had walked up and down several times while preparing for the experiment. Stairs that I had always assumed I would one day walk up for the last time. \n\nI pushed my body as hard as I could. I ran with my right arm dangling limp beside me until I reached the stairs. Behind me, the angered yells of men and the thud of their footsteps remained consistent. I knew that if they caught me, it was game over. \n\nWhen I reached the stairs, I practically jumped up the entire first flight. As I turned to climb the next flight, I saw that only two men had kept pace with me. Suddenly, I was filled with hope. Perhaps I could outrun them all. Then I would go to the police and get the chance to put this whole operation under the microscope. As soon as I got to the top of that second flight of stairs and through the exit doors, I would be free.\n\nMy hopes were dashed as soon as I reached the top of the stairs. At least fifteen men guarded the building’s exit. Clearly my escape had been a contingency for which the facility was prepared. As the men approached behind me and in front of me, I knew there was only one way I could go.\n\nThe alternating staircases continued past the first floor. All the way up to the roof.\n\nI kept running. Staircase after staircase. My aching body protesting each step. My dead arm banging against stair railings and walls as I made my way up those stairs. The sounds of angry men filling my ears as I took step after step after step.\n\nSoon I was on the last staircase. A ladder, hanging from the ceiling, led up to a hatch on the roof of the building. This was it. I was going to see the outside world again. I didn’t know where I was going to go once I got up there, but I knew I was free.\n\nI jumped onto the ladder and pulled myself up, about six feet into the air. When I reached the top I pushed on the hatch. It was heavy and barely budged. I strained against the hatch for a moment, then felt a tight grip on my ankle.\n\nOne of the men had caught up. He had wrapped his cold hand around my leg and was beginning to yank me off the ladder. I turned slightly and saw it was Dr. Monason. His eyes were red and as large as saucers. It was like looking into the eyes of the devil himself. \n\nI reacted purely out of instinct. My grip on the ladder tightened and I swung my free foot at the doctor’s face. As my heel collided with his jaw, sending teeth and blood flying in all directions, I couldn’t help but smile at the feeling. It hurt like you wouldn’t believe, but it felt damned good to feel something. \n\nDr. Monason relaxed his grip. I pushed upwards again and the hatch gave way. I clambered upwards onto the flat roof of the building. A thin layer of gravel covered the rooftop. The sharp stones poked at my bare feet, but I kept moving. I ran to the edge of the roof and looked out into the city. \n\nA beautiful horizon of skyscrapers and stars filled my view. I felt the cold breeze against my bare skin. The voices of the men behind me barely registered as I climbed onto the edge of the roof.\nI must have been a sight to the people walking by on the sidewalk below. A naked man standing on the edge of a building staring at the horizon as if he had never seen one before. \n\n“Please come down from there. You don’t have to go back in the machine. We just need you to come down.” \n\nIt was Dr. Monason again. His voice was hard to understand now that he was short a few teeth. I turned away from the horizon to look at him. He was surrounded on all sides by other men in labcoats.\n\nI knew at that moment that I had no real choices left. Could I believe Dr. Monason that he wouldn’t put me back in the machine? Probably not. But I had no chance to escape at this point. There were too many of them for me to get away.\n\nJust as one of the researchers reached out to grab me, I took a step backward.\n\nAs my body tumbled down to the earth below, I found myself laughing. It was just like when I was in the machine. My body was floating once again. The cold air numbed my body and, once again, I couldn’t feel a thing. \n\nJust before I struck the ground, I heard the sound of church bells ringing out. Hallelujah. I figured I must be on my way to heaven.\n\n--\n\nNo heaven came. Instead, I found myself in complete darkness. Feeling nothing, seeing nothing, simply ruminating on my previous actions. \n\nIs this what death is like?\n\nIn answer to my question, I heard a familiar voice.\n\n“Hello. This is Dr. Monason. I am speaking to you once again via a small speaker contained within the helmet of the exoskeleton. You have successfully completed your three days within the exoskeleton.”\n\nHad I not still been pumped full of numbing drugs, I would have wept. \n\n“We are currently in the process of opening the machine. At that point, we will perform a physical assessment. I’m sure you are anxious to leave. I can assure you we will move as quickly as possible to make that happen. Thank you so much for your assistance with this project. It has been invaluable.”\n\nThree days. I had been in that machine for exactly three days. \n\nIt didn’t click for me until they were pulling me out of the machine. There was no bandage on my big toe, no needle near my foot on which I could have cut myself. \n\nThe facility was nothing but accommodating in the hours after the experiment terminated. They provided me with a comfortable place to rest while the remainder of the drugs left my system. Although they asked questions about my experience, they were not hostile when I refused to speak. The researchers were happy to answer my questions about the experience. Happy to tell me it was all in my head.\n\nIn the days following the experiment, Dr. Monason made sure that I was provided with any mental health resources that I requested. He connected me with a therapist that I have been seeing for several weeks. The therapist has prescribed me an antidepressant, which I take twice a day. I have returned to my normal life. My rent is paid. I’m seeing someone new. I got a new job at another book publishing company. \n\nIt’s like all my fantasies have come true.\n\nBut no matter how long I talk to the therapist and no matter how many pills I take, I can’t get the machine out of my head. I can’t stop thinking about how those three days seemed to extend indefinitely.\n\nA: But you’re out of the machine. Your three days are up!\n\nB: Yes, but…\n\nA: But what?\n\nB: I was out of the machine once before. \n\nA: But that wasn’t real.\n\nB: But it felt real. \n\nA: Does this feel real?\n\nB: . . . I don’t know anymore.\n\nCould three days feel . . . even longer? Could I imagine a therapist, a job, a better life?  I don’t know.\n\nSometimes I close my eyes and I become too afraid to open them, because I’m worried that when I do, I will see only darkness. I’m scared I will find myself still floating, motionless, amongst those imaginary stars. \n\n\n [J.L.](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Jlaughlinhorror)"},"252":{"title":"The previous tenant of my new flat left a survival guide.

Looking at it. At her.\n\nPrudence had a facial expression filled with guilt and now I knew the truth I could see it. The creature was exactly how Ian had described, except with wavy ginger hair and a sadness in its beady eyes. \n\nThis abomination was Lyla. This was how Prudence had bought her back, and this was the only way I would ever see Jamie again, a risk I wasn’t going to take. After days of disbelief the reality finally hit me like a ton of bricks. Jamie was dead and he wasn’t coming back.\n\n“Why did you do this?” I asked, my voice shaking with horror.\n\nPrudence scowled at me, trying to mask her shame.\n\n“I didn’t want this. If you think this was my aim then you’re sicker than I am. I just wanted my granddaughter back. \n\nWhen she died a part of me died. My son blamed me, his wife blamed me and although he never said it, I could see in Bernie’s eyes that he did too. \n\nI’d pushed for her to stay, I wanted to spend more time with her. I got cocky about my ability to cope with the strange occurrences in the flats. I know what you must be thinking. But I swear I didn’t know about the sleepwalking until it was too late.\n\nWe had moved into the flat not long after my son left home to move in with his girlfriend. He’s the youngest of three and was the last to fly the nest, so we downsized for the two of us. He never knew what we were facing in that flat, or the dangers that he sent his little girl into. \n\nWhen it happened it was a few years after the fire and the troubles with the creatures. We’d struck the deal with the things in the lift and the neighbours of the burned flats had become a fixture just like the other quirks. I really thought she would be safe.”\n\nPrudence paused to gaze longingly at the mutated little girl in the cage, the creature just twitched. In return it barred its 4 rows of teeth and made a gentle hiss.\n\n“But how did you do this!?” I stopped her with more urgency this time, looking at rat-Lyla in disbelief. I had to get answers out of her fast. I didn’t want to spend anymore time than was absolutely necessary in this shed. \n\n“The gardener helped me.” She answered, her voice trembling. \n\n“Who the fuck is the gardener?” I grew more impatient with every new confusion she threw at me. The last thing I needed was something new and potentially malevolent in the mix. \n\n“I didn’t mention him in my note because he’s been gone for over 20 years, he’ll be of no concern to you so don’t worry. His damage is in the past now...\n\nAround the time Lyla went missing the council granted planning permission for the tower block next door. But before that was built the land it sits on acted as a communal garden for ours and the neighbouring tower block on the other side. It had a regular gardener named Derek who you would often see tending the flowerbeds out front. \n\nDerek was one of the first people I met when I moved in.\n\nLike I said, I had to work it all out myself and the first time the window cleaner came to the balcony I naturally reached to let him in and offer a cup of tea.\n\nAs my hand applied pressure to the handle to open the balcony door, there was a knock at the front door. I made a gesture to the cleaner to indicate that I would only be a minute and answered. \n\nThere was Derek. He stopped me and told me not to let the man in, that I would be making a huge mistake.\n\nI thought he sounded crazy, and I told him so, after a while of arguing I got up to reboil the kettle and let the man in and Derek grabbed my hands and shouted at me to look at the man outside.\n\nWhen I turned to look, there was no man outside, but a monster. He was tall and impossibly thin, flesh and bones but somehow thinner than bones with greying skin stretched over them. He had eyes that seemed to be so deep set they went on forever, like the blackest cave you can imagine. Saliva dripped from his mouth and landed on my balcony floor, some sliding down the glass panel of the door. \n\nI opened my mouth to scream, but as I did, Derek let go of my hands and the monster was gone. In its place was that smug, friendly man, begging for a drink while he cleans the windows. \n\nIt took me a minute to process it, but I know what I’d seen. That was the real window cleaner. I never intentionally opened or tried to open the door for him again. \n\nThat day Derek didn’t stay long. He didn’t tell me what the window cleaner is, or why he visits every few days. He didn’t explain anything about the weird things that go on. As much as Derek was a part of the strange happenings he was like one that had been carved from light.\n\nHe said that he’d always be around when I needed him, that it was his job to look after the residents just like the flowerbeds. \n\nOver the years he appeared a few times. He was instrumental in striking a deal with the creatures. When the neighbours died in the fire he created a special display for them in the garden, and made sure that nothing planted was poisonous to the cats as soon as they arrived. He also stopped an imposter from killing Bernie at our front door.\n\nHe seemed like such a good thing for the residents. Always there to help. Offer some gentle advice or a creative solution. Someone to be trusted.\n\nHe changed when they granted planning permission for the other block though. He knew his garden would be dug up to lay foundations and his uses redundant. He became grumpy and bitter over time but no one payed enough attention to notice. Especially not when my tragedy struck.\n\nWhen Lyla died I was devastated. Derek appeared to me as I sat on a bench in the garden crying. He offered to help me, to use the garden to get her back. I snapped at him. I told him it was his fault and that he should have been there when it happened to stop them. \n\nHe worked so hard on the agreement with the creatures, he spent a lot of time with them. Lyla broke the rule and he had to allow them to do what had been agreed, he said. He couldn’t have stopped them. But he wanted to help make things right. \n\nI understood why he hadn’t intervened. But I couldn’t accept it, I lashed out at him. I’m embarrassed to say I actually slapped the poor man along with stamping on his freshly planted flowerbed. I was angry and grieving. \n\nI quickly burned myself out and collapsed into a blubbering heap on the floor. Derek attempted to comfort me but his mind was on his garden.\n\nHe said he was sorry for my loss but I shouldn’t have attacked the flowerbed. That he’d always been nice to me and I should be kinder in return.\n\nI snapped and told him that it didn’t matter because it was all about to be bulldozed in the next few days anyway.\n\nI should have taken more note of the way he twitched as I said that. He snapped.\n\nHe said that he knew I was angry. But there was no need to take it out on him, if I was that desperate to get Lyla back he knew a way. But it was dangerous. \n\nI begged. Anything I said. I would do anything. \n\nHe told me it was simple and that all I had to do was enter the lift and offer the creatures some food whilst repeating the phrase *revertetur mortuis* during their frenzied hours. \n\nHe said that there was no guarantee they wouldn’t be crunching on my bones before I even got the first word out but that if I succeeded I would have Lyla back. \n\nOf course, it was successful. There wasn’t a creature in sight as I performed the ritual as instructed. \n\nI thought nothing happened at first. She didn’t appear straight away, but a few days later I found her running round inside my house, she’d taken a chunk out of Damon’s ear with her teeth. I tried to kill her at first, but just as I was about to finalise it I saw in her eyes who she was. \n\nI tried to look for Derek but by that point the workmen had started. Nothing was left of his garden, and nothing was left of Derek. No one’s seen him since. You see, Kat, nothing in that building is totally harmless. You have to be on your guard at all times.\n\nI’ve kept her like this ever since. You may think I’m crazy but I couldn’t kill my own granddaughter. I’m not a monster.”\n\nPrue sighed and ushered me back out of the shed, she locked the door behind us, closing the padlock on her most hideous secret. \n\nI was exhausted. It was a lot of information to take in and as a result of the information I’d received, real grief for my boyfriend was finally settling in. Every hope I had was dashed. I know many of you tried to tell me in the comments that he was gone but I wanted you to be wrong so bad. \n\nI couldn’t bear to look at Prudence Hemmings for another moment. I made my excuses and left, morosely riding the bus back to the tower block I had once been so excited to live in. \n\nIt was mid afternoon by time I got home. The choice between the stairs and lift didn’t strike much enthusiasm into me but I opted for the stairs, and after what I’m sure ended up being 11 flights, I made it the 6 flights up the stairs to my flat. \n\nI laid on our mattress on the floor and sobbed for Jamie. I sobbed so hard my throat went dry and hurt and my stomach cramped with each gasping breath. I sobbed myself to sleep. My body and mind must have given up fighting the need to rest and shut down.\n\nWhen I woke up it was late, about 10pm. I wrote as much of my update as I could for you guys, hit post and just sat at the dining table with my head in my hands. \n\nMy whole life had fallen to shit and I knew it. \n\nI thought about so many things, questioned why they were happening to me. I searched social media for updates on Georgia but there were none. Jamie wasn’t super close with his family but I knew it wasn’t long before they’d start to worry. Everything I considered just snowballed in my mind.\n\nThe loneliness in dealing with this situation was killing me. \n\nI decided to do something I usually wouldn’t. I went downstairs and I knocked on the door of flat 26. \n\nTerri answered. Her perfectly bobbed hair was a little unkempt and out of place, she had huge bags under her eyes and I could smell wine on her breath. \n\n“Are you ok Kat?” She looked concerned. I found it ironic that she looked so disheveled I had forgotten it was me who came for help.\n\n“I’m not... I’m sorry... I know I don’t know you ..I ... just...” I could barely speak.\n\n“Don’t worry. Prue called me. She told me everything. I’m sorry about your boyfriend, it’s a shame I never got to meet him.” Terri stared back at me with the same expression a mother would, warm and understanding. “Would you like a cup of tea, maybe something stronger?”\n\n“I’d love a coffee please.” I answered meekly, making way way into the living room, her sofa was comfy, it reminded me of being back home at my parents before any of this started. \n\nTerri trotted out to the kitchen, stumbling slightly. I could see the kitchen counter from the sofa, and the empty bottle of wine that accounted for her stumbling. \n\nAs she boiled the kettle there was a huge crash from somewhere inside the flat. I jumped, feeling startled. Terri coughed in a meagre attempt to conceal the noise.\n\n“Excuse me for just a moment please.” She muttered apprehensively as she walked out of the living area and into the hallway containing the bedrooms. \n\nI heard another crash, giggling and some inaudible shouting. After a while things went quiet and Terri came back into the living room. \n\n“Sorry about that, kids you know.” She announced, brushing off the noises. I’d almost forgotten about Eddie and Ellie. It was late already and by the resigned expression on Terri’s face indicated that this was how all her nights began. \n\nI nodded. I couldn’t muster up much more of a response. I think she could see that I just needed to sit there. She got up to finish making and then set the cup of tea in front of me with 2 digestive biscuits. I hadn’t eaten properly in days and I really needed the sugar. \n\nIt turned out me and Terri get along really well. We have similar taste in movies, music and food despite the age gap. We spoke for about an hour about random, normal stuff. It was nice to get a break from the madness. I got used to the crashing around from the twins. I even laughed a few times. I’d forgotten what that felt like these past few days.\n\nThe break didn’t last long. The next noise that we heard was louder than the first. It was quickly followed by two small children, running into the living room diving into their mothers arms. \n\nI was taken aback for a moment. Eddie and Ellie were dressed in pyjamas, and were still the cute children that I had met in the hallway, but something was different. Their brown puppy dog eyes had become deep voids, like what I’d imagined when Prue described the window cleaners true form. And at the ends of their fingers were long sharp claws protruding from where nails should be. \n\nI didn’t have time to recoil in terror at their new looks, Terri clutched them and asked what was wrong. They wailed and buried the voids where their eyes should be into their mothers shoulders. Despite their terrifying exterior, these were two very scared little kids. \n\nIt had been a very long day and I thought my nightmare was over but it was only just beginning. Ellie mumbled into Terri’s shoulder, in that high pitched voice kids do when they’re scared.\n\n“Mummy, were sorry, we didn’t mean to let them in. We were just teasing...”\n\n“Shhh they’re coming!” Hissed Eddie, in the same distressed high pitched tone. \n\n“Who’s... what have you done?” Terri asked, colour drained from her face.\n\nThe kids didn’t get a chance to reply. Terri’s face turned paler than I thought possible. I looked up and standing in the living room doorway were about 10 people, all incredibly average looking. \n\nThey were almost expressionless, they didn’t look angry or pleased to see us. They were dressed in non descriptive clothes. I imagined trying to describe them to one of those artists that draws pictures for the police and I genuinely don’t think even one of them had a distinguishing feature. \n\nThat’s why it took me a while to spot her in the crowd, even though she had been glaring at me the entire time. \n\nNatalia.\n\nHow our confrontation went: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/cjzfky\/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app"},"253":{"title":"My job is to watch a woman trapped in a room.

I like it.  My name is actually Melanie though.”\n\nI felt my face reddening.  Of course her name wasn’t actually Rachel.  That was just something I made up in my head.  Still, my embarrassment couldn’t keep up with my confusion and joy.  “Is it really you?”\n\nShe nodded.  “Yeah, it’s me.”\n\nRachel…Melanie grunted as I stepped forward and started hugging her.  Laughing, she hugged me back for a moment, but then she whispered in my ear.  “Thomas, we need to talk, and not out here.  Can we go inside?”\n\nI broke away and nodded, wiping at my eyes as I tried to finish unlocking the door with a shaking hand.  My heart was pounding and I still felt like I was in a strange and wonderful dream, but when we had gotten inside and sat down on my living room sofa, I forced myself to focus on the biggest question I had.\n\n“How?”\n\nMelanie had still been smiling as we sat down, but now she looked worried and sad.  “Thomas, that’s what I’m here to tell you.  Things aren’t like you think they are.  They never have been.”\n\nI frowned, a new line of fear cutting through my happy haze.  “What do you mean?”\n\nShe held the bridge of her nose for a moment, looking down like she was trying to figure out how to say…whatever it was she had to say.  “Thomas…you’re part of a psychological experiment.  I’ve been a part of it for longer than you have as one of the actors, and I still don’t know all the details.  I’m pretty sure it’s run by some government agency, and I know they’re investing a lot of money and time into it, but for what reasons…that I’m not so sure.”\n\nI realized I was wringing my hands.  No, that wasn’t right.  It couldn’t be right.  This was some kind of trick.\n\nMelanie went on.  “What I do know is that you’re being watched as a long-term subject.  They have constructed this whole scenario where you do a secret job watching someone…me…who looks like they might be trapped.  They give you instructions and a way of making choices.  You’ve got buttons or something you can choose between, right?”\n\nI nodded weakly, my tongue thick in my throat.  “Yeah.  A red one.   And a green one.”\n\nShe sighed and nodded.  “I think they’re testing how much you’ll obey.  What choices you’ll make based off of your morals, your intelligence, and your fear.  It’s interesting, or at least I thought so when I first joined up six years ago.  They’ve never officially given me many details, just the overall gist.  But people talk.  The other actors and me, sometimes we hear things, and we gossip.”  She smiled sadly.  “That’s what caused me to start feeling bad.”\n\nI interrupted.  “Other actors?”\n\nMelanie’s eyes widened.  “Oh shit, yeah.  Sorry.  I think they still call him Mr. Solomon?  And there are others too.”  When I just stared at her, she went on.  “Anyway, for a long time it was just the normal job, right?  I spend six hours a day acting like I’m this trapped girl, mainly faking painting or watching t.v.  You know, boring stuff…”\n\nI couldn’t help but interrupt again, hating the hurt trembling in my voice.  “You fake the painting?  You aren’t really painting those wonderful pictures?”\n\nNow Melanie looked embarassed.  “No, sorry.  I can’t paint a bit.  I’m a pretty good singer though.”  She tried to smile, but faltered.  Reaching forward, she touched my arm.  “That’s why they always have the paintings turned where you can’t see them.  They’re already done beforehand.  All you ever see is some blank canvases and…well, when they *want* me to show you something.”  Her expression darkened as she went on.\n\n“That’s why I had to break the rules and contact you.  When they started doing this hidden message, mind game bullshit, I got worried.  Worried you would take it too serious.  That you could get hurt, or even hurt yourself.  As soon as you left your shift tonight, I talked to one of the guys in the video department.  He told me about how you had reacted.  Showed me how you were still parked down the street from the building.  I drove over—the bedroom set is in a building outside of town.  I saw you sitting in your car, and I almost approached you then, but I was scared of getting caught and fired.  So I parked and waited until I could follow you somewhere else and let you know I was okay.”\n\nShe blinked back tears.  “I’m ashamed to say I almost left a couple of times.  I don’t want to lose this job, and I tried to tell myself you would be okay after a day or two.  I could get them to change the script enough that you felt like I was okay and wouldn’t worry too much.”\n\nI felt an angry heat growing in my chest.  “Well, that’s nice of you.”\n\nShe looked up, her eyes red.  “I know.  I’m a shit.  I’m so sorry.  I was being selfish and cowardly, but I didn’t actually leave.  And then when I saw Charlie leaving the building, saw you running over to talk to him, I knew they were escalating it even further.”\n\n“Charlie?”\n\nMelanie rolled her eyes in frustration.  “Shit, yeah.  Sorry.  Charlie Jefferies.  He’s another actor.  In an earlier version of the experiment he actually played Mr. Solomon, but they decided he wasn’t scary enough, so now he’s usually in one of the suits.  He’s actually done that for your version a lot, you just can’t recognize him under all that get-up they wear.”\n\nI kept curling and uncurling my hands on my lap.  It was all too much.  I felt like a pinball going between anger and relief and embarassment and confusion.  “So all that stuff he told me?  That was all just to scare me?  See how I’d react?”\n\nShe nodded as she sniffled and wiped her nose with the back of her hand.  “Yes.  I’m sorry.  That’s why I knew I couldn’t wait any longer to tell you.  I could see how worried and scared you were going back to your car.”\n\nI pulled my arm back from her touch.  “Well, thanks I guess.  At least you stopped me before I went to the police and looked like a joke in front of them too.”  I just wanted her gone, her sympathetic, pitying eyes off of me.  “Thanks for stopping by and letting me in on it.”  I tried to make my voice sound hard and unfeeling, but it came out watery instead.  Standing up, I turned away from her so she couldn’t see as I started to cry.  “If you don’t mind, I…uh…I need time to think about everything.  It’s…a lot.”\n\nA moment passed and then her hand was on my shoulder.  “Thomas, you don’t have anything to be embarrassed about.  They are very good at what they do.  All you did was what you thought was right.  Because you’re a good man.”  I shrugged.\n\n“I thought that you were in trouble and I wanted to help.”\n\nShe gently turned me toward her, and when I looked up, she smiled and sniffed again.  “I know, but you need to realize, most people wouldn’t have tried to help.  Not when it meant giving up their job or risking themselves like that.  Not for a stranger.”\n\nI wiped at my face as I looked away.  “Well, I still feel dumb, but I’m glad it’s not real.  I’m glad you’re okay.  That we both are.”  I paused and caught her eye again.  “We are, aren’t we?  Safe, I mean.”\n\nShe hesitated before nodding.  “Yeah, I think so.  Like I said, they have a lot invested in whatever this is, and the fact that they’re willing to go as far as they have with you makes me wonder, but I’ve never seen any signs of anyone getting hurt.  I think the worst that could happen is one or both of us gets fired.”\n\nI felt my face getting red again.  “Oh, don’t worry about that.  I’m going to quit tomorrow.  I’ll finally get to hit their damn buttons.  Maybe both of them.”  I started to smile, but then I saw the look on Melanie’s face.\n\n“Thomas, please don’t do that.  I don’t think they would hurt us, but if you up and quit, they’ll figure out I’ve talked to you.  I don’t think they watch us all the time, but I don’t know what they can find out.  You know, tracking cellphones, spy satellites, whatever.  I’m taking a big risk just being here, and I don’t want them catching on.”\n\nI took a step back from her.  “So you want to keep getting paid to trick people like me.”\n\nShe reached out and grabbed my right hand.  I had been clenching it unconsciously, and it relaxed at her touch.  “No, I don’t want to.  But I wasn’t expecting this.  How the experiment has changed, getting to actually meet you…I can’t do it long-term, but another month or two to save up money?  Now that you’re in on it and won’t be scared or hurt by it any more?”  She smiled.  “That I can do.  That we can *both* do.  We can keep going like normal, take some more of their money, and then one of us can quit.  The next month, the other one can.  How does that sound?”\n\nI shrugged uncertainly.  It made some sense, and once I had calmed down, it would probably make more.  She gave my hand a squeeze.\n\n“And when this is all over, I want to get to know you better.  I know I’ve been playing a role, but for the most part, that’s been me you’ve been watching all this time.  I think it’s only fair I get to see more of you too.”  She blushed.  “Assuming you’re interested in that.”\n\nI felt my hand growing clammy in hers as my stomach fluttered.  “Well, I mean…yeah.  Yeah, I would really like that.”  Swallowing, I added, “How long do we have to wait to see each other again?”\n\nMelanie grinned at me.  “Work another month or so.  Save what you can.  And then quit.  I’ll wait another two or three weeks, and then I’ll do the same.  And then…”  She looked up at the ceiling as she pondered it for a moment, and I was struck again by how beautiful she was, even if she was a little different in person than I had imagined.  ”…three months from tonight we’ll meet right here.  I’ll come over and we can start getting to know each other better.  How’s that sound?”\n\nReturning her smile, I nodded.  “That sounds great.”  \n\n****\n\nWhen she left a couple of minutes later, part of me hated to see her go, but another part was relieved.  I was so exhausted, and while I was so happy she was okay and we had finally met, I felt like the burned up wire in an old lightbulb.  I needed time alone.  Time to think and calm down, and most of all, time to rest.\n\nI didn’t really even remember falling asleep, and when I woke up, I realized my alarm had been buzzing for over thirty minutes.  I jumped up and raced to get to my shift at work.  As she had been leaving, Melanie had stressed again how we needed to act completely the same.  That meant not freaking out, but it also meant not acting like everything was okay either.  If I suddenly showed no signs of being worried about her, that would tip them off too.  I promised and she left after a brief hug and kiss.  Remembering that now, through the haze of my tiredness the night before, it felt like a dream.\n\nStill, I went into the surveillance room with a much lighter heart.  I didn’t have to worry or feel guilty any more about not helping her, and there was some satisfaction in finally pulling one over on the people that had tricked me for so long.  Besides, in three months I would be done with this place and get to see Ra…Melanie again.  In person, at least.\n\nBecause I got to watch her on the video feed as soon as I came into work.  She was asleep when I first got there, and I found myself wondering if she was as tired as I still felt.  When she woke up later and started reading a book, I found myself beginning to smile and had to stop myself.  I should still be worried acting, not smiling like I had a crush.  I had to do better so Melanie didn’t get in trouble.\n\nAn hour or so later she started working on another of “her” paintings.  Watching her work, I was amazed at how real it all looked.  It was hard to see everything from my angle, but I would have sworn she had paint on those brushes and was really painting whatever was on the canvas.  I found myself feeling proud of her.  She really was a great actress.  Not only didn’t I see her giving any clues that we had met or talked, but she really did seem different in the room than she had in my apartment.  I supposed that was what she had meant by “playing a role”. \n\nI was almost at the end of my shift, and while I hated to leave her, I had to admit that I was ready for some more sleep.  Trying to guard my reactions all day had been exhausting, and I was dreading the next few weeks.  But then I realized she was done painting.  I expected her to just go and do something else, but instead she picked up the canvas at its edges and carefully walked it over to the sofa.  Her body was blocking it at first, but then she stepped aside.\n\nIt was a painting of a massive tree.  The bark was a dark red, with a huge twisting trunk that broke off into a dozen branches.  Those branches were covered in leaves that were so deep green they almost reminded me of storm clouds more than the top of a tree.  Like all the paintings, I felt touched by it, even now that Melanie had told me she didn’t paint them.  The images themselves, combined with the colors and the small details…they really were amazing.  \n\nJust like this one.  If you looked close enough, you could see that there were several small blackbirds in the branches of the tree.  It was funny, but they almost looked like they were…\n\nIt almost looked like they were made out of words.\n\nI felt my heart start to hammer and I forced myself to stay calm.  No point in being silly.  I knew it was all a game now, and I just had to play my part a little while longer.  Still, the worried me would want to know what the words said, so I might as well try to read them.  I squinted, following the birds right to left and top to bottom.\n\n**That**\n&nbsp;\n\n**girl**\n&nbsp;\n\n**isn’t**\n&nbsp;\n\n**me**\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI looked away from the painting to see Rachel staring up at me.  She looked terrified.\n\n[*Oh no.*](https:\/\/redd.it\/9ndww5)\n\n****\n\n[Part Four](https:\/\/redd.it\/btkvkl)"},"254":{"title":"The Monster Under your Bed isn't Always there to Scare You","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/7xhpsm\/the_monster_under_your_bed_isnt_always_there_to\/","flair":null,"author":"lifeisstrangemetoo","selftext":"I was lying alone in my room when I heard the voice, deep and crackly, coming from beneath my bed.\n\n“Hey,” the voice called out.\n\nI told myself I was just imagining it. \n\n“Hey kid,” the voice repeated.\n\nI drew my knees up to my chest and ducked my head under the blanket, trying to shut out the voice and the cold wind that drifted in through the window, ruffling the curtains.\n\n“Who are you?” I asked.\n\n“I’m the monster underneath your bed,” the voice replied.\n\n“You mean you’re real?” I asked. \n\n“What do you mean?” the monster said. “Of course I’m real.”\n\n“Do you have a name?” I asked.\n\n“Of course I have a name.”\n\n“Oh... well what is it?”\n\n“Frank.”\n\n“Frank?”\n\n“Yeah,” the monster said. “Is there something wrong with that?”\n\n“No. I mean, I don’t know,” I said. “It’s just not very monster-ly.”\n\n“Well my parents didn’t want me to be a monster.”\n\n“Really?

I wanted to ask him what he meant, but I fell silent as I heard a rustling coming from the closet. The door creaked open, and I could hear soft footsteps padding towards me across the bedroom floor. I didn’t dare peek out of the blanket. The footsteps stopped, and I could hear heavy breathing next to me. I squeezed my eyes tight.\n\nThe warm sanctuary of the blanket disappeared as it was yanked off me.\n\nI hugged my arms around my knees and prepared for the worst. A scream shattered the night air, followed by the sound of breaking glass. I opened my eyes a crack to see a knife lying on the carpet next to my bed, blade glinting in the moonlight.\n\nMy parents rushed into the room and asked me what had happened, but I didn’t know what to say, only that someone had been hiding in my closet and they’d jumped out the window. \n\nMy parents called 911, and the police came right away. They picked up a man called Gary Thompson sprinting through the streets a couple blocks away. He was covered in blood and broken glass. They found Gary’s car abandoned on our property, and inside they found duct tape, knives, barbiturates and a video camera. \n\nFrom what I heard Gary’s lawyer employed an insanity defense, and Gary is currently incarcerated in a state mental facility for the criminally insane. \n\nI never heard from Frank the monster again, but the officer who arrested Gary told me that he sleeps on the floor of the facility.\n\nHe tells the doctors that he’s terrified of Frank, the monster under his bed.\n\n[x](http:\/\/davidmaloneystories.com)"},"255":{"title":"I found an extremely bizarre internet survey","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/8kalgj\/i_found_an_extremely_bizarre_internet_survey\/","flair":null,"author":"Mr_Outlaw_","selftext":"Nobody knows what rock bottom truly is until they've hit it. \n\nBeing abruptly fired from a job you've worked at for the past ten years, and then catching your girl cheating on you with your replacement really makes a man think. \n\nHell, *my student loans aren't even paid off yet*.\n\nWhat a shitshow this life is. \n\nAfter a rather boozy night that consisted of sending out about four dozen resumes and horrendously written cover letters, I passed out. \n\nWhen I woke up the next morning, I decided to at least *try* and make some money at home while waiting for an interview. \n\nAt that moment, I thought that the best way to go about it was completing those internet surveys that yielded 5 dollar subway gift cards and other shit like that after about an hour of answering questions. I mean, I didn't have any other marketable skills that could've yielded immediate income. \n\nIt was either that or wasting the day away playing computer games. At least I wouldn't have to pay for food. \n\nI did these surveys for about 5 hours before nearly passing out. It was way more excruciating then I'd originally anticipated. At the end of those 5 hours, I'd accumulated about $45 in cash and gift cards. \n\n$9 an hour. Not like I was making much more than that before. I was about to close my laptop up for the day and head to a bar in an attempt drown out my melancholy when I first saw it. \n\nIt shouldn't even have been noticeable... but for one reason or another, it was. At the bottom corner of the website that I was on, existed a tiny, singular advertisement. Maybe it was the simplicity that got me. Plain black letters in a tacky font that read \"Surveys for cash\" overlapped a completely white background. \n\nAt least they were direct with the message. *One more couldn't hurt*, I thought. Might as well scrape together a little bit more booze money before heading out.  \n\nI sat back down, clicked on the picture link and prepared myself to grind through some more painstaking inquires. The first few questions were simple enough. I guess they weren't really questions, but more data collection. My name, age and occupation. I thought it was kind of weird that they also asked my height and weight, but it wasn't unheard of. \n\nThe first **real** question was a different story though. I must have stared at it, eyes wide and mouth agape, for god knows how long. \n\n*What the actual hell?*\n\nIn plain English, this is what popped up on my screen: \"How strong is your urge to currently look behind you?\" \n\nThere were five options below, ranging from \"Not at all\" to \"overwhelming\". \n\nThere was no feasible reason why I should've been afraid at that moment. *But I was*. I tightened my breathing, trying to make out any subtle noises behind me. There were none. After maybe about five minutes, I worked up the courage to look. There was nothing. I sighed in relief and scoffed at myself at the same time. \n\nThis must have been some kind of joke. However, I decided to entertain it, answering \"neutral\" and clicking onto the next question. This is what it read: \"Why would you look behind you?\" \n\nI smirked. *Funny*, before simply typing in a \"I don't know\" in the response box and once again clicking next. This was the 3rd question: \"You're on a plane. Apart from you, there is only one other passenger, who is sitting somewhere behind you. At some point, you get up to go to the washroom, and find that the man is gone. You check to see if he is in the only bathroom on the plane, but he isn't. What do you do?\"\n\nAgain, I must have stupidly stared at it for nearly ten minutes. Was this some kind of obscure personality test? I mean, it must have been, right? *Right?* \n\nI put the same answer that I used for the last question: \"I don't know.\" It was true. I didn't know. How was I *supposed to* answer this shit? \n\nI click next again, now more intrigued than anything. The 4th question went like this: \"You wake up in woods unfamiliar to you. It's nighttime, and the moonlight provides you with only slight visibility. About thirty feet away from you, there is a small, dimly illuminated cabin. The door is open, and a smiling woman is motioning for you to come in. Do you go? Explain why.\" \n\nThis question wasn't necessarily weirder than the last one, so my conjecture that this was some kind of odd personality test was still feasible. I actually make an attempt to answer this one, something along the lines of going into the cabin because there's simply nowhere else to go. \n\nOnce again, I click next. Probably shouldn't have. \n\nThe questions started getting *fucked up*. They weren't too gory or explicit, not anything like that. They were just stranger. Weirder. More psychologically disturbing. If you're wondering why the hell I kept going, I can't really give you an explicit answer to that. I just felt like I *had to*. It was an esoteric, creeping sensation that I can't quite explain away. But I could never shake it. So I just went on. \n\nSome of the questions that stood out were:\n\n\"Suppose that you wake up one night to find an elevator in your house. During every midnight after that, it opens up for five minutes, revealing an exact copy of yourself that gets progressively more injured as time goes on. Do you keep living like this? Or do you enter the elevator once and end it all?\"\n\nAnd:\n\n\"You're in a hotel room but are awoken by a rapid knocking at your window. You peek through the blinds, seeing what appears to be a man missing both his eyes. He puts his mouth to the glass and tells you to kill the woman in the bathroom immediately. Do you listen to him?\" \n\nThis was one of my least favorites:\n\n\"You are watching home videos with your mother. One of the tapes include footage of her being murdered by a masked intruder. Your mother simply laughs at this footage without saying anything. In your opinion, is this a cause for concern?\" \n\nIn addition to this insanity-inducing shit, there were some rather disconcerting events happening in *real life* as well. I received a knock at the door about thirty minutes in. I looked through my peephole to find a guy standing there, frantically shaking his head and mouthing \"no\" while making direct eye contact with me. He looked terrified. Obviously, I didn't open up. \n\nI received about ten phone calls from somebody named \"the auditor\" on my caller ID. They left a message every time, but each one was just a recording that consisted of somebody saying numbers through heavy static. Actually, it sounded more like *screaming* now that I think about it.\n\nAbout an hour into this thing, and I was on the verge of a mental breakdown. I was petrified of looking behind me, even though there was no indication that anything should've been there. I heard some soft scratching coming from my vent at one point, so I moved my couch over it. \n\nEventually, I reached what appeared to be the end of the survey. However, it wasn't a question. It was simply a statement. \n\n\"Don't let them in. They're not to be trusted.\" \n\nAlmost as if it were on cue, I heard more knocking at my door about five seconds after reading this. As slowly and silently as I could, I moved over and looked through the peephole once again. It was a different person than the one I'd seen earlier. She was a woman, looking to be in her mid twenties. She was wearing a thick blazer, despite it being around 90 Fahrenheit outside. She was also wearing sunglasses, so I could never really tell where she was actually looking. She eventually took a piece of paper out of her pocket and slipped it under the door. \n\nI look down and read it. \n\n\"It's lying. Leave your apartment immediately.\" \n\nIt's been about half an hour since. I can't bring myself to look at the computer screen nor at the woman outside. She's still there. I can see the shadows of her feet from underneath my door. I heard my bedroom window open a few minutes ago, but I've since jammed the door shut with a chair. I can hear some kind of distorted muttering coming from behind it now. \n\nMaybe rock bottom wasn't so bad. \n\n*But what the fuck am I supposed to do here?* "},"256":{"title":"I’ve been squatting in a condemned high rise.

I just don’t own it. But it’s mine and I work to keep it. Every city has its fair share of abandoned buildings to squat in, but usually you gotta deal with either cops or shitty neighbours. The Annedale High Rise has neither. Police stay away, so do the locals. As a stranger from out of town I stumbled across the place on my first night in the city and thought it a little strange that a 28 story tower block had been left to rot. Every window black. Every light in the courtyard smashed. No cars in the lot. No booth for a guard. Not even barbed wire on the fence. Barely half-a-mile from a playground filled with shouting drunken teenagers but none of them strayed in the direction of Annedale. No fires or music or bottles hurtling through the air. It was silent.\n\nInside, I found that the lobby had been torn to shit. Double doors ripped open and left that way for what looked like years. Easy access for the curious, but I was the only one there. Most of the first story had collapsed. Waterlogged ceiling tiles turned to mulch by shitty British weather. I know water is invasive, but it had practically fucking colonised the place so bad algae was growing up the walls. Even the elevator shaft was flooded. My own reflection looking back at me as I peered through brackish water and caught a glimpse of the old rusted carriage just a few feet below. I couldn’t help but think about standing on top of it, waist high, and reaching down to pull open the emergency hatch. Only natural to wonder what was down there. Little metal box soaking in pitch black water for years and years. I thought about pressing the button, calling it up and seeing the elevator rise in spite of all logic. An image I still think of from time to time.\n\nMeanwhile the empty shaft loomed above, cables whistling in the wind. I’ve learned not to linger by it. If you look up you’ll sometimes see something ducking out of the way, pulling its head through the doors before you get a good look. It finds it awfully funny, even tries to make a game out of it, like peekaboo. Play too much though and it starts to pop up elsewhere. Any open door becomes an invitation. Sent more than a few people running for their lives in the middle of the night, but bad news for them. That thing is more than free to leave this place if it’s part of a game.\n\nIf you ask about Annedale most people just shrug or laugh. Kids’ll talk about it same way they talk about any haunted house. Difference is no one dares anyone to go up there. No one uses it to get pissed or high. No one sneaks into the basement to have a risky little fuck. No one hides their stashes there. It has all the hallmarks of your classic urban legend, only people *actually* stay away. They’ll laugh and joke and tell scary stories, but they treat the soil its on like it houses a radioactive leak. And the council, I’m surprised they haven’t knocked it down but they, out of everyone in the city, have the most to lose by talking about it.\n\nThey built it in the mid fifties as government housing. Only a lot of the young mothers who moved in there found their children’s health taking a turn for the worse. Started with newborns. Babies that wouldn’t wake after a peaceful night’s sleep. The kinda deaths that got written off as either negligence or abuse, screaming teenage girls hauled off to prison on the words of doctors who didn’t give a shit. It’s always the mother’s fault in some people’s eyes, and these girls had no one to stand up for them. Two in the first year, four in the next, and they kept on coming for every year until it closed.\n\nWasn’t until 1982 that someone traced the source of deaths to tainted water storage on the roof. Toxic metals leeching into the supply. Not enough to kill an adult, but bad news for anyone with weak immune systems. Thirty eight women had been imprisoned by then. Another twenty three had killed themselves before they could be sentenced. And those are just the ones accounted for. Not all the deaths were from the water. Annedale has a way of being bad for any child’s health, no matter the circumstance.\n\nMore than a few toddlers starved to death as their parents rotted in the tub from an overdose. Even more were lost when they found their parent’s stash, little bodies wracked with agonising fits as their panicked mothers screamed for help. One tripped down the elevator shaft because the doors opened as if the carriage was right there. And those are the ones who were found. Plenty more went missing, written off as runaways. In the end Annedale’s reputation as a cursed place got so bad the only way out was to shut the whole thing down. Board it up. Erase it from the records. Pretend it never happened and just forget.\n\nBut Annedale kept on killing even after the doors were officially shut. If anything it only got nastier. Talked to one cop who told me he found a guy dead from sepsis on the sixth floor couple years after the place was shut down. No one could fucking believe it. They reckon this guy scratched himself on a nail and caught gangrene like it was the 1800s. Never went to the hospital. Just laid there and died slowly and painfully as the infection spread, but not before he took every last bit of furniture in the room and shoved it against the door. Strange enough on its own, but it was the flag he’d made out of his own clothes that freaked everyone out. He’d scrawled *HELP* on it, like he wanted to get someone’s attention down below even though the lock was on his side. He could’ve left anytime he wanted.\n\nCop I spoke to said he was there when they kicked the door down. Still remembers the look in dead man’s eyes. He was glaring at the door two days after he’d passed, white knuckled fists gripping a blanket that smelled sickly sweet from all that infection.\n\nThere were others too. Lots of people falling, many of them without a good reason. Got so bad they bricked the roof door but by the time I arrived someone had cleared it all away with a sledge hammer. I still don’t hang out up there. Not after I first went up and saw pale fingers gripping the ledge, like someone was hanging off it and holding on for dear life. I reckon a lotta people see something like that and think a person needs their help. They go rushing over to offer a hand. But when I saw it something about those grimy nails set alarm bells off in my head. Fingers looked all wrong. So I took my coat off and used a broom handle to move it closer to the ledge. Sure enough those ugly hands snatched at the coat and ripped it outta my hands, sending it hurtling to the parking lot below. I’ve thought about taking a closer look from time to time, but I got a thing about heights and could never bring myself to investigate it much further.\n\nYou’d think I’d leave, but it’s my home. I own it as much as it owns me. People even refer to me as the caretaker now like they forgot I wasn’t always here. Police treat me the same, can you believe that? Any reports of a break in and they call me on my number to go take a look, like I’m some sort of official. Only other guy who was here as long as me was the philosopher. I don’t know his name, just call him that because of the books he left behind. He came here back when the block was still just a place to live and he stuck around for a few years after its closure. Lots of notebooks in his flat. Thousands of pages talking about child sacrifice made to gods who don’t like being named, along with pictures of strange things frozen in ice and medical photos that look fake.\n\nAt first I thought he came to document the curse. He has dozens of books just recording all the strange things he saw, like birds with too many wings or milk that turned to clotted blood in the bottle. But after going through every thing he owned I found letters to a wife who’d died in childbirth. He kept her death certificate way at the back of an old looking box filled with the letters he’d kept writing her long after the date.\n\nAnother box, just a row over, had the letters she’d written back. Awful things scrawled on random scraps, shit and blood for ink. He dated them himself and sometimes wrote notes about how they came to him.\n\n*Delivered by a rat that was cannibalised in front of me.*\n\n*Pulled by my dentist from a cavity in my mouth.*\n\n*Written in the web of a spider with thirteen legs.*\n\nAnyway, he gives away the real reason he moved to Annedale in one of the letters. Says that Annedale was the key to helping her, that he was weeks away from figuring out how to open the door. Told his wife he’d bring her back. Told her he knew how. I’ve never figured out where he went next or what happened to him, but his apartment was locked when I found it and likely would’ve stayed that way if the key hadn’t turned up in my inside pocket on the first morning. Now I live in his old place. It’s safe in there. He’s written things on the wall that keep everything well behaved. Symbols that I don’t understand but which are easy to trace so that’s what I do. I go over them every couple of months and so far they’ve kept me safe and sane.\n\nBecause you do need protection in Annedale. I don’t know when in its history the curse went from something mundane to something very real and very dark. It wasn’t all just bad luck or poverty, not by the end and certainly not anymore. You can’t just go strolling around Annedale, certainly not at night. It’s dangerous. For one thing, it attracts a constant rotation of the deeply unwell who are likely to attack on sight, if you’re luckly. They usually turn up dead in the halls come morning, although sometimes it’s just bits of them that I come across. Strips of skin floating on the brackish water that floods the basement stairwell, or bloodied fingernails embedded in the ceiling plaster. Weirdest one was a single tooth in a lightbulb, bloody gum still attached to the root, the glass all around it somehow intact.\n\nMany of them come here with business, something a little like the philosopher’s. Rituals. Bargains. Things like that. It’s not a good idea to interrupt them, or to give them even the slightest hint you might be a problem. Every night I lock my door and wait for Annedale’s business to finish and come morning I do a sweep, floor by floor, and clean up whatever’s left of the tower block’s strange pilgrims.\n\nMost of the rituals don’t look real to me. In fact, I reckon a lotta people who come here just end up as victims of something or someone else. There are a *lot* of reasons to stay out of Annedale at night, and most of its visitors strike me as a little naïve. Most of what I see looks like it got stolen from a bad death metal album. I once found a book called “Satanism and Witchcraft in the 21st Century”. It’s hard to imagine that the secret inner workings of the universe can be found in something with an ISBN number and 3000 Amazon reviews. Of course, not all attempts at exploiting Annedale’s energy are so hackneyed. I had one guy turn up at my door and pay me three grand in cash just to show him the darkest corner in the building. I wasn’t sure what he meant at first. Thought he meant light and shadow.\n\n“Sort of,” he replied when I explained this to him. “Darkness like that can be part of it. But I’m looking for a corner, has to be a right angle or more acute. Ideally, more acute. You understand that term right?”\n\nHe’d seemed arrogant and that last sentence confirmed as much. Good looking guy in his late twenties, nice suit. Looked like the stereotypical banker. Acted like one too.\n\n“Plenty of places like that,” I said. “Lots of funny rooms in Annedale. People trying to make the most of limited space. Sometimes the walls meet at tight angles, sure. But I don’t know what you mean about dark. There’s the basement. It’s flooded. Can’t think of anywhere darker than that.”\n\nHe bit his lip and hesitated for a second or two, as if he was actually contemplating it.\n\n“Not a bad suggestion actually, but no, too difficult to reach. And I don’t just mean dark as in the absence of light. I mean dark like under the bed. Dark like that one chip in a wall that leads to a hollow space between the bricks and as a child you can’t help but wonder what lives there. Somewhere that just inexplicably feels… like it’s not got as much of God’s attention on it as everywhere else.”\n\nI thought about this for a second. His words were vague but damn if I didn’t know what he meant.\n\n“A corner?” I asked. “Has to be an acute corner?”\n\nHe nodded.\n\n“I think I know the place,” I said and he smiled like real creep.\n\nI took him to a flat on the eighth floor. It was rundown like everywhere else but there was still enough of its old furniture lying around. You can pull open random drawers in there and still see the cutlery people once used. There’s even an old analogue TV on an old stand. You can perch on what’s left of the sofa and stare at that TV and get the feeling you knew the people who lived there once. Run your thumb over the dials on the toaster, the handle of the fridge, or the yellowing plastic of a light switch, and feel an aching loss that creeps up on you out of nowhere.\n\nLook up and you’ll see that the light fixture has been torn out of the ceiling, like someone had tried swinging from it.\n\nNot a big place, by the way. Three rooms. A bedroom with a double bed all rumpled up. A living room slash kitchen. And a tiny little spare room that looked like it once would have been used for storage, or a washing machine maybe, *if* you were single and childless. A slither of space, a triangle carved out of whatever room was left over when other more important walls had been put up. That sofa I mentioned, the TV, they were all placed so whoever was sat down could always keep an eye on that room and its contents.\n\nYou see they’d put a cot inside and it’s still there, bluebottle flies circling overhead. You can’t see inside the cot, not unless you went in and actually pulled the blankets out but it’s been decades and no one has managed it yet. It’s dark behind those old blankets, a heavy shadow that dissuades a closer look, like there’s something in there no one needs to see and it’s spent a long time sat there eating what little light there was. Even with a window in that room, daylight doesn’t really filter down.\n\n“Perfect,” the businessman said when he saw it. He gazed around the flat one detail at a time, his head pausing for a moment and a smile creeping across his face as he laid his eyes on the broken light fixture. And the cot, the sight of it, the flies that still circled above faded Winnie the Pooh blankets, it made the breath catch in his throat.\n\n“Oh this is… *yes* this is good,” he told me. “Dark like under the bed. You’ve earned that money. I could have had a dozen men sweep this place and they wouldn’t have understood the brief as well as you have.”\n\n“Thank you,” I replied even if that wasn’t really how I felt.\n\nQuietly the man sat down and began to unpack his leather satchel. No pentagrams to be found, although he did unpack seven strange looking candles. He caught me looking at them and smiled.\n\n“Home made,” he said. “Each one shaped by my hands. I’m not a good artist, but it’s the effort that counts. Took forever to rend the wax. Of course that was the easy part. The hard part was getting the fat to make it. Did you know there can be a surprisingly high level of security around a hospital’s medical waste department?”\n\n“I didn’t,” I replied as he took out some flimsy bits of wood and a few small nails. He oh so carefully began to nail the splinters of wood together into what looked like random shapes.\n\n“Oh well,” he sighed after a few quiet moments, his fingers nimbly gripping the tiny hammer as he tapped away. Already he’d put together at least six of the strange little wooden polygons, and with each new one I felt a strange sensation. “Would you like to stay and watch?” he asked.\n\n“Absolutely not,” I answered.\n\nHe stopped tapping and smiled once more.\n\n“Oh you’re clever,” he said. “That’s the correct answer, by the way. And if I’m to respect it, I should inform you that now is the safest time to leave.”\n\nI made my way to the exit just as he lit the first candles, but not before I looked towards the cot one last time. I was surprised to see a hollow blackness that extended beyond the doorway, like a curtain had been draped across it, only there was depth to it that drew the eye. The businessman paid it no attention, but after a few more seconds he eventually looked up at me expectantly.\n\n“Can I ask what is it you want?” I said. “Everyone who comes here, I don’t get the sense it ever works out for them.”\n\n“I’m looking for a new kind of afterlife,” he replied.\n\n“Do you need one?”\n\n“We all need one,” he said with a wry chuckle. “But only those of us willing to take a few risks will get a better deal. Everyone else…” He grimaced. “It’s worth the bother. But look who I’m speaking to.”\n\nHe looked to the darkness that enveloped the doorway. Shapes could be seen floating past.\n\n“You should leave now,” he said.\n\nI pulled the door shut and, noticing that the sun was rapidly setting, ran to my apartment where I knew the walls would keep me safe.\n\nWhen I returned the next day the man’s satchel was still where I’d last seen it, propped against one arm of the sofa. The candles had burned down to the very end of the wicks and left a lingering smell that’s still there all these years later. And of the man himself, well in the room with the cot—which still has bluebottle flies orbiting overhead—there is now a shadow burned into the wall. It’s blurry and diffused, but vaguely recognisable as a man on his knees, his head pressed to the floor in a gesture of supplication.\n\nI’ve known it to occasionally move, to turn its head and look towards me at which my point my temples throb, my ears pop, and a darkness begins to encroach upon the edges of my vision. I never exactly considered that flat to be Disneyland before, but now I avoid it like the plague.\n\nStill, it could be worse. Not every ritual ends so cleanly and at times I’ve had to personally intervene, something I hate bitterly. If people want to go poking around in the universe’s undercarriage that’s their business. It’s one thing if I’ve got to sweep what’s left of them up afterwards but at least that’s a one and done job. Sometimes it isn’t so clean. One guy turned up and told me he’d be a new “resident”, my neighbour, and we’d get to know each other. A bumbling old man with an upper class accent and the look of a professor who was down on his luck. He set up in the room next to mine and no matter how little I spoke to him, he never really got the hint and kept trying to act like a good friend. Few times I did initiate conversation it was to tell him the place he’d chosen didn’t have much in the way of protection. He pointed to some funny little rashes and told me *they* were his protection.\n\nOver the next few weeks I’d bump into him from time to time, always on his hands and knees, scraping some dank corner or mouldy pile of bumpy growths. He collected fungi, told me on the first day, and I’d often see him wiping his samples onto petri dishes that he whispered quiet words to whenever he thought I wasn’t around. I don’t think he was sane, but he probably wasn’t completely barmy because he lived long enough to get a sense of Annedale and only come out in the day. Meanwhile his apartment filled up with a growing collection of chittering terrariums and pickle jars, their specimens hidden by murky fluids. All over, he planted and cultivated strange mushrooms and moulds. Encouraged them to soak up the darkness of Annedale and set them to grow in the rife conditions he’d cultivated.\n\nTowards the end his living room had mushrooms growing out the walls. Plaster crumbling beneath microbial armies until there was only concrete and rebar, and even then mould continued to grow and thrive. A few times I peered in and found him feeding meat to the frilly growths that exploded out of the old furniture. During this time the symbols on our shared wall would often grow hot, and I found myself having to replace them on a nearly daily basis as he tinkered away on the other side. I asked him once or twice to tone it down.\n\n“This is important work,” he growled, an unseen darkness creeping into his voice. “I’m not some ditzy crackhead trying to summon the Baphomet! I’m not looking to get *high*. This is science. Progress! That is what I am working towards.”\n\n“Yeah well your progress is trying to eat its way into my flat. Can you ask it to stop?”\n\nHe stopped, froze in mid gesture like I’d said something either profoundly stupid or insightful, or likely a bit of both. He looked at the rashes on his arms that had, by now, started to sprout some of their own strange fruit. When he finally spoke again it was sly, like a lecherous old man propositioning a nurse.\n\n“This fungi,” he said. “They had samples of it in the university for thirty years! Can you imagine? They never even realised what they had until I found it and unlocked its potential. Now I’ve finally found the source and I can do things no one else thought possible. This entire time my thesis has depended upon the idea that the fungus has… a capacity for information processing way beyond anything we’ve considered before. And your idea is a good one, you know? Asking it just might be an option…”\n\nHe scuttled off without another word and for the next few days he set about the building like a furious little honey bee in Spring. Poking and prodding, setting trap after trap and cleaning them vigorously of any rats or mice he caught. When I did my morning sweeps I’d find him hovering over Annedale’s latest victims, scraping what was left of them into transparent bags for his own purposes.\n\n“Don’t mind me,” he’d mutter. “It’s worthless to you, but these poor souls could help me achieve great things.”\n\nThis persisted for another month. He no longer scraped mould or mushrooms off old apartments. He became interested only in meat, and by the time it came to an end I can say confidently that I have never smelled anything worse than the prickly musty odour that wafter out from under his locked door. It became so bad that I began to wonder if I might have to ask for police help and have him removed when, finally, he simply disappeared from Annedale’s halls. One morning he was there, annoyingly shooing me out of the way as he lowered jars into the flooded basement, and then the next he was gone and Annedale’s halls were silent once more.\n\nBut that didn’t mean he had moved out. Far from it, actually.\n\nIt took two days before I decided to just go ahead and break his door down. I kicked at it with a short sharp blow only to find my leg immediately disappeared through wood that had the texture of sodden cardboard. I freed my foot and tried a different tactic, grabbing the handle and pulling so hard that it simply *popped* right out of the rancid wooden frame. Free to move, the door swung open with an eerie creak and fetid air, hot and damp, blew out of the room.\n\nInside I found that the man’s specimens had gone wild. Terrariums had shattered, their contents spilling outwards. Frogs as large as footballs glared at me from behind furry fronds, and insects with human eyes scuttled away before the amphibians could snatch them up. In one corner rats had built a hive out of old cardboard, their backs covered with fungal growths that resembled human fingers and other appendages. In another corner something that looked a little like a black rubber sheet slapped furiously at passing vermin and it took me a few seconds to realise it was a slime mould. When it finally caught something it dragged the strange creature squealing into the dark corner where it grew and constricted around its meal like a fist. I stared at it horrified until one by one black orbs unveiled itself from within the strange mass and I realised it had eyes to stare right back at me.\n\nIt was a cacophony of God awful terror, so gripping that it kept me from hearing the muffled noise of a human struggling to speak. Eventually it did reach my ears and I used my torch to light up the far wall without having to actually step inside.\n\nI found the scientist half-grown into the wall. Algae and moss coated him head-to-toe so that he was no longer recognisable, but I had to assume it could be no one else. Wide eyes glared at me with terror and pain as nasty little critters nibbled away at what was left of his shins, meanwhile strange tendrils probed at his ears and head, never resting for a moment. He kept trying to speak, but the algal growths kept driving their way into his mouth until, one-by-one, they pushed too far and something snapped. His eyes went wider still, his squeals became hysterical, and his jaw slowly slid further down his chest until it hit the floor with a sodden thump.\n\n“Finally made contact?” I asked. “An awful idea if I’ve heard one. What would a mushroom have to say even in the best of circumstances? Let alone one that was grown in the ruins of Annedale? I can only assume you never got around to telling it to stay off my wall, did you? No you probably had your own reason or doing all of this and that’s what took priority.”\n\nThat made me wonder what it was he’d asked for. As the thought entered my head I took a quick look around and tried to see if anything particular stood out to me. Something was growing on the sofa that looked strangely human-shaped. It might have been just my imagination, but in the dark it seemed to turn towards me. Meanwhile the scientist continued to shiver in agony, his eyes focused on me and begging for help.\n\n“I’ll see what I can do,” I said before slamming the door. Something about that strange pile on the sofa had deeply unsettled me.\n\nI put the word out, asked for a gun, but got a crossbow instead a few days later. A nervous looking sixteen year old boy ferried it to my door. I was surprised he’d entered the building, but who knows who’d ordered him to do so. I’ve acquired a strange sort of respect amongst the locals and it comes in handy. This boy looked like he would have stamped on my head and robbed me blind any other day, but when he spoke to me he did so with more respect than I ever imagined I deserved. I thanked him, took the crossbow, spent an afternoon practicing with it, and then used it to kill the scientist the next morning.\n\nTook a few hits, but in the end one thumped into his forehead and shut down his whimpered moans. I didn’t see anything on the sofa this time, at least not anything human-shaped, which I was thankful for. After that it was a simple case of calling the police and beginning a long chain of events that ended with half-a-dozen men in hazmat suits spraying the room with noxious chemicals. For a while there I’d been worried that they’d find a corpse and ask questions, but by the time anyone actually entered the room there was nothing left of the scientist save a splotch on the floor.\n\nI never did figure out exactly what it was he was after, although it is not uncommon for my morning sweep to turn up a body (or part of) covered in fungal growths. And I have been known to occasionally catch glimpses of a strange person lowering themselves into the floodwater of the elevator shaft. Of course I might just be making connections that aren’t really there. All sorts of things live in that water. The entire level is flooded and if something was down there, it’d have free reign over quite a large space.\n\nIt's a strange world down there. I should know on account of one visitor who gave me a very bad time. I’ll call him the fisherman since he came to Annedale because of the flooded basement. Saw a photo that’s been circulating around for a while now, if you know where to look. God knows who took it and how, but it shows the flooded stairwell leading to the basement and beneath the brackish surface is a hand that’s all out of proportion. Fingers splayed with perfect symmetry like a starfish, it is reaching up out of the depths and resting gently on the third step below the water.\n\nWhen I first met him he was sitting happily with his feet over the edge of the flooded shaft, water up to his knees, with a rod and line set up beside him. It was quite a surprise at first, seeing him there with a little fly-fishing hat. A chubby but healthy looking man in his forties with an egg mayo sandwich in one hand and a phone playing candy crush in the other. I called out to him as I approached because, in my experience, startling someone in Annedale is bad for your health no matter how sane the visitor appears.\n\nHe looked up when I caught his attention and smiled amiably.\n\n“Hello,” he waved with his sandwich. “You’re the caretaker?”\n\n“Yes I am,” I answered. “And you are?”\n\n“Just a tourist,” he smiled. “Care to join me?”\n\nThe sun had risen only moments ago.\n\n“You weren’t here when it was dark, were you?” I asked more than a little suspicious.\n\n“Oh no you’ve only just caught me, been here barely ten minutes before you showed up. I was told you’d be willing to help in exchange for a small fee.”\n\n“What sort of help?” I asked.\n\n“Oh just give me a nudge if any of the lines start moving,” he said while pointing to a rod he’d set up beside the basement stairs. The door was propped open and the line led down into the darkness below, water gently lapping just out of sight. Another line had been set up in a corner of the lobby where the floor had been torn away revealing a hole straight down into the basement. “I can’t keep an eye on them all at once, you see. I have bells ready but, well, two heads are better than one.”\n\n“What is it exactly you’re hoping to catch down there?” I asked.\n\n“Are you familiar with the primordial ocean?” he said. “The abyssal waters that God split into light and dark, all that? It’s not a physical location, per se, but it does connect to certain bodies of water depending on the time and place. Last recorded manifestation was in a glass of old whiskey underneath a forgotten bar in Mexico City. Some poor fellow knocked it over and didn’t notice until the following day when half the bar was suddenly underwater. Quickly rectified but some of the things swimming in that water were something else, and all from at the bottom of a glass no wider than my wrist. Imagine what we can do with this!?” he said while gesturing at water by his feet.\n\n“You think there could be fish alive down there?” I asked.\n\n“At least,” he replied. “I’d be willing to pay for any reliable information, of course. Do you have any idea what might be down there?”\n\n“Not really,” I shrugged. “But I’d guess it wants to be left alone.”\n\n“Hmmm you might be right there,” he said while looking at his other rods. “I didn’t exactly put down any old lure, you know?”\n\nHe reached into his pocket and took out a strange tuft of fur and ivory, holding it up for me to squint at.\n\n“A tooth from a man who drowned in the sea. A drone collected it off a shipwreck near the Norwegian coast. The fur is actually red algae that was found growing on his bones. I have plenty of these and, well, other things that might appeal to what’s on the other side. My research was thorough and expensive. Come on, take a seat. Flat fee, one thousand, just sit here until the sun starts to set.”\n\n“I just have to sit?” I asked.\n\n“And let me know if you hear or see anything.”\n\nI groaned and sat beside him, folding my legs instead of letting them dangle in the water below. Despite my reticence, we stayed like that for several hours. He’d brought lots of food, good homemade stuff, along with plenty of cold beer. We sat there and spoke very little, but we did eat and drink a tremendous amount. Not the kind of thing I do normally, but I was being paid to be there, and I didn’t really have anywhere else to be. It was, all in told, a very pleasant afternoon.\n\nUntil I fell asleep.\n\nWhen I awoke it was with a terrible gasp. My chest was tight like something had been sitting on it, and judging from the terrible giggling and scampering feet I heard running off into the darkness, it might not have been *just* a feeling. Already panic was setting in as my eyes darted to the open doors and saw that the moon was out and had been for hours. I fumbled for my torch and turning it on saw that there was no sign of the fisherman. All his stuff had been left behind yet all that remained of him was his hat that still floated on the water. Even as I watched, a smooth glistening shape curled beneath the water and plucked it off the surface.\n\nI recoiled and crawled away from it as fast as I could. This was bad, I knew deep in my heart I’d never been as at risk I was in that moment. The open doors that led outside were tempting, but just beside them were the stairs that led downwards and I swore I could hear something approaching. I couldn’t help but picture the fungal man I’d seen in the scientist’s flat. Then again, that basement was huge and who knows what lay down there.\n\nI decided to go for the stairs. The entire time my heart was in my chest. I had never been caught outside my room at night, not since my first night when I’d slept in the lobby with my coat pulled over me. You don’t get lucky twice, not with Annedale, so I knew had to be careful. I had to be quiet. My only hope was to go unnoticed. I took to stealth, climbing each floor in perfect silence, hiding in well known spots at the slightest hint of footsteps, human or otherwise.\n\nAnnedale comes alive at night. Whispered mutterings from strange children who descend from air vents, living there for God knows how long. Other times I saw apparitions including one, a toddler, the sight of whom made my stomach growl with an insatiable hunger that hurt just to contemplate. She stared at me with pleading eyes as I slunk away from her open door. I might have been tempted to help her were it not for the sight of the moon peering through her translucent image.\n\nAnd yet, despite all this, I somehow made it to the fourteenth floor alive. Only it was there right at the final hurdle, so close to safety, that I came across something out of my worst nightmare.\n\nA woman stood outside my apartment door. Silent. Pale. Dirt covered fingernails. It was all too often I’d open my door and find muddy impressions on the floor made by a woman’s bare feet. Now I knew who left them every night. I couldn’t see her face from where I hid, but something about her seemed profoundly familiar.\n\nWhen she finally turned towards me I remembered. I recognised her, even though most of her face was missing. It was the philosopher’s wife. He had succeeded, it seemed. But I couldn’t imagine at what God awful price, because the woman who stared at me had clearly weathered some years in the grave. It was only the poor lighting and her long hair that had covered up just how bad a state she was in. A lipless grin stared back at me below sunken cheekbones and hollow eye sockets. And yet, I could tell that in another life she had been beautiful which only made the sight all the more gut-wrenching.\n\n“My darling,” she whispered, and there was something about her voice that I found hard to stay sane in the face of. I don’t know why. Over a decade in that place and I’d borne witness to living nightmares, but it was *this* walking corpse that pushed me to my limits. The inescapable feeling of loss weighed me down and without realising it I found myself taking steps towards her even as my knees buckled. By the time I reached her I was crawling until I could clutch her grimy icy leg, and that was the last thing I remember before I woke up in my bed the following morning.\n\nEverything seemed normal, so completely mundane that I could’ve written the whole thing off as a bad nightmare. But there were footprints leading from my bed to the door. And later on I found the fisherman’s things much as he left them, although when I finally reeled his lines in I found the lures gone and replaced with bits and pieces of the man who’d first set them up. I threw it all into the water below and decided it would be best to forget him.\n\nEvery now and again, of course, I can’t help but check my peephole at night. I never did before that, but now I do. I see her every single time. She looks sad. Hurts me to think of her out there. It ought to be terrifying but it’s more like someone’s ripped out my stomach and heart and let all my insides fall out the bottom.\n\nEach time I see her I wonder what exactly was it he did to bring her back?\n\nHe leaves only one hint. A final letter, I think. It’s not like he dated them. In it he says he would give everything to have her in his arms once more. Not only his life, but everything he’s already lived. Every sunset. Every good dream. Every nightmare. Every victory. Every loss. Every little memory that makes him who he is, he’d give it all just to save her.\n\nSometimes I wonder about him, figuring we’d probably be about the same age. I’d like to think back and imagine what it would have been like for the two of us to meet as young men, but for some reason whenever I try to remember what my life was like before I came to this city, before I woke up with that coat pulled over me… well, I don’t know…\n\nIt’s just hard, that’s all.\n\nIt's almost like there's nothing there. Like something reached in and took all the years away. I guess it's just one of those things I'm better off not dwelling on."},"257":{"title":"I'm a Search and Rescue Officer for the US Forest Service, I have some stories to tell (Part 2!)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3ijnt6\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/","flair":"Series","author":"searchandrescuewoods","selftext":"First post: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3iex1h\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/\n\nSo I logged back on tonight and was blown away by the staggering amount of interest this seems to have generated. First off, I'll address a few things that you guys have brought up:\n\n* There's been an overwhelming amount of people mentioning the similarity between some of my stories and those of David Paulides. I assure you I'm not trying to rip him off in any way, I've got nothing but respect for the guy. He's actually what inspired me to write this, because I can verify a lot of the things he talks about. We do have a lot of these strange missing persons cases, and most of the time they aren't solved. Either that, or we find them in places they have no business being. I personally haven't been on many calls like that, but I'll share a few that I've seen, and a story my friend told me that relates to this.\n\n* There was a lot of feedback about the stairs, so I'll touch on that briefly here, and I'll also include a story. \nThey come in a variety of shapes, sizes, styles, and conditions. Some are pretty dilapidated, just ruins, but others are brand new. I saw one set that looked like they came from a lighthouse: they were metal and spiral, almost old-fashioned. \nThe stairs don't go up infinitely, or farther than I can see, but some sets are taller than others. Like I said before, just imagine the stairs in your house, as if someone cut-and-pasted them in the middle of nowhere. I don't have any pictures, it's never really occurred to me to try again after the first time, and I don't really feel like risking my job over it. I'll try again in the future, but I can't really promise anything.\n\n* A few people expressed confusion about the guy who ran into the man with no face. Just to clarify, when the climber ascended and reached the top of this peak, he saw another man in a parka and ski pants. This was the man with no face. Sorry about the confusing wording of that story, I'll try to avoid that in the future.\n\nAlright, on to the new stories:\n\n* As far as missing persons go, I'd say about half the calls I get are related to that. The others are rescue calls; people who fall down cliffs and hurt themselves, get injured by fire (you wouldn't believe how often this happens, mostly drunk kids), get bitten or stung by animals or insects. We're a tight team, and we have veterans who are excellent at finding signs of lost people. That's what makes these cases where we never find any trace of them so frustrating. One in particular was upsetting for all of us, because we *did* find a trace of them, but it just led to more questions than answers.\nAn older man had been hiking alone on a well-established trail, but his wife called to say that he hadn't come home when he should have. Apparently he had a history of seizures, and she was worried that he hadn't taken his medication and had suffered one out on the trail. Before you ask, I have no idea why he thought it was okay to go out alone, or why she didn't go with him. I don't ask about that kind of thing because past a certain point, it really doesn't matter. Someone is missing, and it's my job to find them. We went out in a standard search formation, and it wasn't long before one of our vets found signs that the guy had gone off the trail. We grouped up and followed him, spreading out in a fan to make sure we were covering as much ground as possible. Suddenly, a call comes over the radio telling us to all head back to the vets location, and we come right away, because this usually means the missing person is injured, and we need a full team to help get them out safely. \nWe meet back up, and the vet is just standing at the base of a tree with his hands on the sides of his head. I ask my buddy what's going on, and he points up into the branches of this tree. I almost couldn't believe what I was seeing, but there's a walking stick dangling from a branch at least thirty feet off the ground. The little strap thing on the handle has been looped around the branch, and it's just hanging there. There's no way the guy could have tossed it up that far, and we don't see any other signs that he's still in the area. We call up into the tree, but it's obvious no one's in it. We're all just sort of left scratching our heads. We keep searching for the guy, but we never find him. We even bring our canines out, but they lose his scent long before this tree. Eventually, the search is called off, because there are other calls we have to attend to, and past a certain point there's not much we can do. The guy's wife called us every day for *months*, asking if we'd found her husband, and it was heartbreaking to hear her get more and more hopeless each time.\nI'm not sure why this call in particular was so upsetting, but I think it was just the sheer improbability of it. That and the questions that were raised. How the hell had this guy's cane ended up there? Did someone kill him and toss that up there as some weird trophy? We did our best to find him, but it was almost like a taunt. We still talk about that one from time to time.\n\n* Missing kids are the most heart-breaking. Doesn't matter what circumstances they go missing under, it's never easy, and we always, *always* dread the ones we find deceased. It's not common, but it does happen. David Paulides talks a lot about kids SAR teams find in places they shouldn't be, or couldn't be. I can honestly say I've heard about this kind of thing happening more than I've seen it, but I'll share one of the ones that I think about a lot that I witnessed personally.\nA mother and her three kids were out for a picnic in an area of the park that has a small lake. One is six, one is five, and the other is about three. She's watching them all really closely, and according to her, she never lets them out of her sight at any time. She never saw anyone else in the area either, which is important.\nShe packs their stuff up and they start to head back to the parking area. Now, this lake is only about two miles into the woods, and it's on a *very* clearly established trail. It's almost impossible to get lost getting from the parking area to it, unless you're deliberately going off the path like an imbecile. Her kids are walking in front of her, when she hears what sounds like someone coming up the path behind her. She turns around, and in the four or so seconds she's not looking, her five-year-old son vanishes. She figures he's stepped off the trail to pee or something, and she asks her other two where he went. They both tell her that 'a big man with a scary face' came out of the woods next to them, took the kid's hand, and led him into the trees. The two remaining kids don't seem upset, in fact she says later that it seems like they've been drugged. They're sort of spacey and fuzzy. So of course, she freaks out, starts looking frantically in the area for her kid. She's screaming his name, and she says at one point she thinks she heard him answer her. Now obviously she can't go blindly running into the woods, she's got the other two kids, so she calls the police and they send us out immediately. We respond, and we start the search for him.Over the course of this search, which spans *miles*, we never find a single trace of the kid. Canines can't pick up any scent, we don't find any clothing or broken bushes or literally anything that would signify a child being there. Of course there's suspicion about the mother for a while, but it's pretty clear that she's completely destroyed by the whole thing. We looked for this kid for weeks, with a lot of volunteer help.  But eventually, the search peters out, and we have to move on. \nThe volunteers keep searching, though, and one day we get a call on the radio letting us know that a body has been found and needs to be recovered. They tell us the location, and none of us can believe it. We figure it has to be a different kid. But we go out there, about 15 miles from the site where he vanished, and sure enough, we find the body of the kid we've been looking for. \nI have been trying to figure out how this kid got where he did ever since we found him, and I've never come up with an answer. A volunteer just happened to be in the area, because he figured he might as well look in places no one else would think to on the off chance the body had been dumped. He comes to the base of a tall, rocky slope, and half-way up, he sees something. He looks through his binoculars and sure enough, it's the body of a little boy, stuffed in a little opening in the rock. He recognizes the color of the kid's shirt, so he knows right away that it's the missing boy. That's when he calls it in, and we're dispatched.\nIt took us almost an hour to get his body down, and none of us could believe what we were seeing. Not only was this kid 15 miles from where he'd started, there was no possible way he could have gotten up there on his own. This slope is treacherous, and it's hard even for us with our climbing gear. A five-year-old boy had no way of getting up there, of that I'm certain.\nNot only that, but the kid doesn't have a scratch on him. His shoes are gone, but his feet aren't damaged or dirty. So it wasn't as if an animal dragged him up there. And from what we can tell, he hasn't been dead that long. He'd been out there over a month by that point, and it looked like he'd only been dead for, at most, a day or two. The whole thing was unbelievably strange, and was one of the most disconcerting calls I've ever been on. \nWe found out later that the coroner determined the kid had died from exposure. He'd frozen to death, probably late at night two days before we found him. There were no suspects, and no answers. To date, it's one of the weirdest things I've ever seen.\n\n* One of my first jobs as a trainee was a search op for a four-year-old kid that had gotten separated from his mom. This was one of those cases where we knew we were gonna find him because the dogs were on a strong scent trail, and we saw clear signs that he was in the area. We ended up finding him in a berry patch about half a mile from where he'd been last seen. Kid wasn't even aware that he'd wandered that far. One of the vets brought him back, which I was glad for because I'm really not good with kids, and I find it hard to talk to them and keep them company. \nAs my trainer and I are headed back, she decides to take me on a detour to show me one of the hot spots where we tend to find missing people. It's a natural dip in the land near a popular trail, and people will usually move downhill because it's easier. We hike out there, it's a few miles away, and we get there in about an hour or so. As we're walking around the area and she's pointing out places she's found people in the past, I see something in the distance. Now, this area we're in is about eight miles from the main parking area, though there's back roads you can take to get closer if you don't want to hike that far. But we're on state-protected land, which means there can't be any kind of commercial or residential development out here. The most you'll ever see is a fire tower or makeshift shelter that homeless people think they can get away with building. But I can see from here that whatever this thing is has straight edges, and if there's one thing you learn quickly, it's that nature rarely makes straight lines. I point it out, but she doesn't say anything. She just hangs back and lets me wander over and check it out. I get within about twenty feet of it, and all the hair on the back of my neck stands up.\nIt's a staircase. In the middle of the fucking woods. In the proper context, it would literally be the most benign thing ever. It's just a normal staircase, with beige carpet, and about ten steps tall. But instead of being in a house, where it obviously should be, it's out here in the middle of the woods. The sides aren't carpeted, obviously, and I can see the wood it's made of. It's almost like a video game glitch, where the house has failed to load completely and the stairs are the only thing visible. \nI stand there, and it's like my brain is working overtime to try and make sense of what I'm seeing. My trainer comes and stands next to me, and she just stands there casually, looking at it as if it's the least interesting thing in the world. I ask her what the fuck this thing is doing here, and she just chuckles.\n'Get used to it, rookie. You're gonna see a lot of them.' I start to move closer, but she grabs my arm. Hard.\n'I wouldn't do that.' She says. Her voice is casual, but her grip is tight, and I just stand there looking at her. 'You're gonna see them all the time, but don't go near them. Don't touch them, don't go up them. Just ignore them.' I start to ask her about it, but something in the way she's looking at me tells me that it's best if I don't. We end up moving on, and the subject doesn't come up again for the rest of my training.\nShe was right, though. I'd say about every fifth call I go on, I end up running across a set of stairs. Sometimes they're relatively close to the path, maybe within two or three miles. Sometimes they're twenty, thirty miles out, literally in the middle of nowhere, and I only find them during the broadest searches or training weekends. They're usually in good condition, but sometimes it looks like they've been out there for miles. All different kinds, all different sizes. The biggest I ever saw looked like they came out of a turn-of-the-century mansion, and were at least ten feet wide, with steps leading up at least fifteen or twenty feet.\nI've tried talking about it with people, but they just give me the same response my trainer did. 'It's normal. Don't worry about it, they're not a big deal, but don't go close to them or up them.' When trainees ask me about it now, I give them the same response. I don't really know what else to tell them. I'm really hoping someday I get a better answer, but it hasn't happened yet.\n\n* This is another one that was less spooky and more sad. A young man went missing late in winter, when realistically no one should be going that far out onto the trails. We close a lot of them, but some remain open year round, unless there's a shit-load of snow. We did an op for him, but we had about six feet of snow on the ground (it was an unusually heavy snow year), and we knew it wasn't likely that we'd find him until spring when the thaw came. Sure enough, when the first big thaw came, a hiker reported a body a little ways off the main trail. We found him at the base of a tree, in a pile of melted snow. I knew right away what had happened, and it scared the living shit out of me. Most of you who ski or snowboard, or spend any amount of time on a mountain, will probably have guessed too. When snow falls, it doesn't collect as thick in the areas beneath the branches. It happens most with fir trees, because they have a sort of closed umbrella shape. So what you end up with is a space around the base of a tree that's filled with a mixture of loose, powdery snow, air, and branches. They're called tree wells, and they're not immediately obvious if you don't know what you're looking for. We put up signs in the welcome center, big ones, letting people know how dangerous they are, but every year that we get an unusual amount of snow, at least one person doesn't read them, or doesn't take the warning seriously, and we find out about it in spring. \nMy best guess is that this young man was hiking and got tired, or maybe a cramp from walking in the deep snow. He went to go sit at the base of the tree, not knowing that there was a tree well, and fell in. He got stuck with his feet up, and the surrounding snow caved in around him. Unable to free himself, he suffocated. It's called snow immersion suffocation, and it doesn't usually happen except in really deep snow. But if you get stuck in a weird position, like this guy did, even six feet of snow can be lethal.\nWhat scared me the most was imagining how he must have struggled. Upside down, in the freezing cold, he didn't die quickly. The snow would have formed a dense, heavy pile on top of him, and it would have been literally impossible to get out. As it got harder to breathe, he would have known what was happening. I can't even imagine what he was thinking in his last moments.\n\n* A lot of my less outdoorsy friends want to know if I've ever seen the Goatman while I've been out on calls. Unfortunately, or I guess fortunately, I've never had anything quite like that happen. I guess the closest was the whole 'black-eyed man' thing, but I didn't see anything. However, there was one call where I had something kind of similar happen, but I'm not sure I'm willing to chalk it up to the Goatman.\nWe'd gotten a report that an older woman had fainted along one of the trails, and needed assistance getting back down to the main area.\nWe hike up to where she's at, and her husband is just beside himself. He runs, well, I guess more jogs, to us, and tells us that he was a little ways off the trail looking at something when his wife starts screaming behind him. He runs back to her and she's passed out on the trail. We get her on a backboard, and as we're getting her down to the welcome center, she comes to and starts screaming again. I calm her down and ask her what happened. I can't remember verbatim what she said, but essentially, what happened was this:\nShe'd been waiting for her husband when she started hearing this really strange sound. She said it sounded sort of like a cat, but it was off somehow, and she couldn't quite figure out why. She went a little ahead to try and hear it better, and it sounded like it was coming closer. She said the closer it got, the more uneasy she was, until she finally figured out what was wrong. I do remember this next part, because it was so weird that I don't think I could forget it if I tried.\n\"It wasn't a cat. It was a man, saying the word 'meow' over and over. Just 'meow, meow, meow'. But it wasn't a man, it couldn't have been, because I've never heard a man make his voice buzz like that. I thought my hearing aid was going out, but it wasn't, I adjusted it and it still sounded all buzzy. It was awful. He was coming closer, but I couldn't see him. And the closer he got the more scared I was, and the last thing I remember was a shape coming out of the trees. I guess that's when I fainted.\" \nNow, obviously I'm a little perplexed as to why a guy would be out in the fucking woods chanting 'meow, meow' at people. So once we get down the mountain, I tell my superior that I'm gonna go search the area to see if I can find anything. He gives me the go ahead, and I grab a radio and hike back to where she fainted. I don't see anyone, so I keep going about a mile more, and I when I head back I go off the trail, to see if I can figure out where she saw him coming from. It's almost sunset by this point, and I don't have any desire to be out at night alone, so I just sort of write it off and make a mental note to check it out again tomorrow. But as I'm headed back, I start to hear something in the distance. I stop, and I call out for anyone in the immediate area to identify themselves. The sound didn't come closer or get louder, but it sounded exactly like a man saying 'meow, meow' in this really odd monotone. As comical as it makes it sound, it was almost like that guy on South Park with the electrolarynx, Ned. I go off the trail in the direction I think it's coming from, but I never seem to get closer. It's almost like it's coming from all directions. Eventually, it just sort of fades out, and I ended up going back to the welcome center. \nI didn't get any further reports like that, and even though I went back to that area, I never heard that exact sound again. I suppose it could have been some stupid kid out there fucking with people, but even I have to admit it was weird. \n\nSo this kind of turned into a massive wall of text, and for that I apologize. I wanted to get to the stories my friend told me, and he does have some good ones, so I'll post those tomorrow evening. I also have a few more of my own I think you guys will like. I'm sorry to keep you all in suspense again, hopefully the stories here make up for it and help you get through the next 24 hours until I can post again!\n\nEDIT: Since it seems like all of you would like to hear more, tomorrow I'll write up as many stories as I can and do a massive post. I'll include my friend's stories, and I'll see if I can't get ahold of a few more people who might have interesting things to talk about. I just wasn't sure how people felt about big huge walls of text, but if you're all okay with it, I'll post lots of stories!\n\n**EDIT: Part 3 is up: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3iocju\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/**"},"258":{"title":"The Grim Reaper's scythe isn't to harvest you. It's to protect you from something on your journey.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/6imkuw\/the_grim_reapers_scythe_isnt_to_harvest_you_its\/","flair":null,"author":"TobiasWade","selftext":"There is no fear as potent as the fear of the unknown. No monstrous visage discovered yet has been as terrifying as the infinite potential for horror which exists before the mask is removed. \n\nThat is why we humans, in our naive misunderstanding of the universal order, are gripped by the mortal fear of death. We think it the final frontier - the greatest imaginable unknown from whose penumbral shores no traveler may return. And so we cling desperately onto even the most dreary and anguished lives, suffering any known evil over our release into the beyond. \n\nBut death is not to be feared, because death is very well understood. We have witnessed it, caused it, measured and recorded it to the last dying spasm of neuronal flickering. Even as I lay dying, it seemed silly to me that I should be afraid of the emptiness which reason promised to expect. \n\nWhile I was alive I wouldn't experience death, so there was no reason to be afraid now. When I was dead, I wouldn't be capable of experiencing anything, so fear still had no cause. That thought brought me great comfort as I felt the last erratic struggle from my heart against the inevitable conclusion I approached. It wasn't until I was finally drifting off to sleep that a final intrusive doubt bubbled in my brain:\n\n*What if it isn't death which is to be feared? What if it is what lies beyond?*\n\nAnd so troubled did I slip beyond mortal understanding, stepping into a world as far forsaken by reason as I was now from life. I was still in the hospital room, but the bustle of nurses and the beeping machines lost their opacity as though I was mired in swiftly descending dusk. It seemed as though every sound was an echo of what it once was; every sight a reflection. With each passing moment, the world was becoming less real...\n\nBut all that sight and sound - all that being - it wasn't simply disappearing. It was *transforming* into a figure beside me. The less real my room became, the more real the figure was, until presently it existed in such sharp actuality that nothing beside it seemed real at all. \n\nHis cloak was black. Not the *color* black, but its essence. It was as though seeing a tiger after a lifetime of looking at a child's crude drawing and thinking that's all a tiger was. Reality flowed around his scythe like a brush through water colors, and I could see each elementary particle and time itself sunder across its blade. \n\nSurely this, I thought. This is why we were taught without words to fear death. I clutched at my hospital blanket to cower from the intensity of the Reaper's presence, but the once soft cotton now flowed like translucent mist through my hands. I knew in that moment that nothing could hide me from the specter's grasp, for he was the only real thing in this world. \n\n**You're late.**\n\nThey weren't words. My head ached from the strain of this knowledge as my lateness was burned into my awareness, imparted like an inescapable law of physics as unequivocal as gravity. \n\n**We don't have time for the usual speech. Hurry now.**\n\nI felt myself swept up around him like dirt in a hurricane. Before I knew what was happening, we were outside the hospital, moving at such a frenzied pace that the world around me blurred into a dizzying tunnel of flashing light. \n\n**If you're lucky, IT will have gotten bored of waiting for you.**\n\nI had too many questions, all fighting for attention in the forefront of my brain without any making their way out. \n\n**You're quiet. I admire that. Usually people ask too much.**\n\n\"What's the point?\" I asked. My voice felt flat and dead compared to his overwhelming substance. \"How can I try to comprehend something so beyond mortal knowledge?\"\n\n**You can't. But it's still human nature to ask.**\n\nWe weren't slowing. If anything, our pace was increasing. I wasn't running, or flying, or anything of that nature. It was more like the rest of the world was moving around us while we stood still. A vague darkness and a heavy damp smell made me guess that we'd gone underground, but I couldn't say for sure. \n\n\"One question then,\" I asked. \"What else is here besides you?\" \n\n**And that is why questions are pointless. Death is not a place, or a person. It's all there is.**\n\nTroubling thought, but made more so by the growing howl which began reverberating the rocks around me. We still seemed to be descending into the Earth, and the air was growing warmer and denser now. The sound continued to mount as though the world itself was suffering. \n\n\"Then what is IT?\"\n\n**What I'm here to protect you from.**\n\nThe rocks split from a flash of his scythe, and the ground opened further into a sprawling cavern dominated by a subterranean lake. \n\n\"But I thought you said you were all there is.\"\n\n**No, I said Death was all there is.**\n\nWe weren't moving any longer. Light glinted off the scythe from some unseen source and streamed into the lake like a tributary. Once inside, the light didn't reflect or dissipate, but swirled and danced like luminescent oil. \n\n\"I thought you were Death.\"\n\n**Death is not a person.**\n\nThe light was taking a life of its own inside the water. The still surface began to churn with the enigmatic energy. It took my scattered mind a long while to realize that *I* was the energy flowing into the lake. I still felt tangled up with the figure, but we now existed as a beam of light boiling into the water. \n\nI knew I wouldn't understand, but that didn't stop me from feeling frustrated. If Death is all there is, then what is IT? What was waiting for me? The water pressed in around me and I couldn't speak, although I could still draw breath somehow. \n\n**IT is here.**\n\nSomething was in the water around me. Hands grabbed me by the legs and began dragging me downward. I was amazed to even discover I had limbs again. They felt so alien to me that it was almost as though this body was not my own. Light flashed from the scythe - then again. The hands let go, and the howling rose once more. The Reaper was fighting something, although I couldn't make any sense of the battle except for the madness of thrashing water.\n\nThe howling Earth reached its crescendo, and the *screams* made the water around me convulse and contract like living fluid. Had the Reaper cut it? Was I safe? I began to explore my new body in the water, but just when I thought I was beginning to gain control the hands clutched me once more. I lurched downward, struggling in vain against their implacable grip. \n\n\"What is here?\" I tried to shout against the suffocating liquid. \"What is happening?\" \n\nBut I couldn't sense the Reaper's presence any longer. The heat was unbearable, but the cold depths the hands were dragging me toward was even worse. I became aware of a blinding light at the bottom of the lake, and though I struggled, the hands dragged me inexorably onward. \n\n**I'm sorry. I couldn't fight IT off.** It seemed to be coming from so far away now. **We will try again next time.** \n\nThe pressure - the heat - the noise - the hands dragging me into the blinding light. I closed my eyes and screamed. I was free from the water now, but I just kept screaming. I couldn't bear to look at IT - whatever had stolen me. Whatever was Death but wasn't - whatever even the Reaper could not defeat. \n\nThen words spoke. Real, human words from a real human mouth. My senses were so distraught that I couldn't make sense of them, but I'm guessing they were something like: \n\n\"Congratulations! He's a healthy baby boy.\" \n\nMost people can't remember the day they die, or the day they were born. I happen to remember both, and I know that [they are the same](http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sirtobiaswade).

My twin sister, Chel, begged me to rush with her the summer before our freshman year approached, but I think she knew deep-down I was a lost cause. I was a band geek in high school, and a band geek I intended to remain.\n\nDon't get me wrong - this isn't some \"not like other girls\" bullshit. I was happy for Chel. I even got trashed on celebratory wine coolers with her when she pledged her sorority. We just had different interests. As long as she was happy, that’s all that mattered, and I know she felt the same about me.\n\nHow did I miss that she was so deeply unhappy?\n\nShe threw herself off the bell tower in the center of campus less than 3 weeks before the end of the spring semester. I hadn’t seen her in a couple of days; I was holed up at the library pulling double all-nighters to finish my final paper for Greek and Roman Mythology. I woke up in the early afternoon on a Sunday to 10 missed calls from mom and a text from Chel. \n\n*love u forever Lou. i’m so sorry.*\n\n2:55 a.m. Witnesses say she jumped at 3:02.\n\nI skipped finals, took incompletes in all of my classes, and headed home to be with my mom. Alex, our best friend from high school, offered to bail on the rest of the semester too, but I didn’t want him to lose his scholarship. Still, he made the 2-hour drive home every weekend to hang with me. We didn't talk much; it still hurt too much to remember the good times, and I didn't care much about the present. But it was better than drinking alone, and Alex was generous with sharing his weed.\n\nMy mom insisted I get back into the swing of things this Fall. I decided just to do a half-time course load, mostly focused on finishing up my classes from last semester. I moved into a solo room in the dorms that’s more the size of a closet than a real livable space. I didn’t mind being alone. I kind of preferred it that way.\n\nAlex, though, thought that the solitude was bad for me. Or at least that’s what he claimed when he dragged me along to a Greek party last weekend. Chel was popular among the guys in his fraternity, he said, and they’d all been asking about me. Worried. I really didn’t want to go, but Alex wouldn’t let up.\n\n“It’s what Michelle would want, Louise.” \n\nAsshole. Even if he was right.\n\nThat’s how I found myself last Saturday in the passenger seat of Alex’s BMW, driving out in the middle of bumfuck nowhere. I quickly realized I had no idea where the hell we were or where we were headed. I’d never gone to a frat party with Chel - navigating a sea of sweaty dudes who smell like PBR isn’t my ideal night out - but I was pretty sure most frat houses weren’t 45 minutes from campus, tucked away off a dirt road that didn’t even have a name on Google Maps.\n\nI picked at a fraying thread on the hem of my sweater, one of Chel’s. It was bright green and haphazardly cropped at the waist in a homemade chop job. It wasn’t my style at all, and I never would have worn it before Chel...before she was gone. But that night, wearing it gave me confidence, like she was there with me.\n\n“So....what’s the deal with this party anyway? Or are you driving me out to the middle of nowhere to murder me?” \n\nAlex rolled his eyes and fished a piece of black cardstock out of the mess of napkins on his center console. The paper was heavy, expensive, with gold-embossed letters glittering in a scrolling font:\n\n*You Are Cordially Invited*  \n*The Sisters of House Omega welcome you to our Fall semester Culling.*  \n*Attendance is mandatory.*  \n*Only the true of heart will remain until dawn.*  \n*Will that be you, Alex?*\n\n“Did all the guys in the house get one of these?” I turned the paper over, where an address and time was listed. County Road 5. Midnight.\n\n“Yeah, ‘bout a week ago? We’re still trying to figure out who’s hosting.” \n\n“It’s not this Omega sorority?”\n\nAlex laughed at me, not unkindly. “There’s no such thing, Louise.”\n\nI frowned. A party in the middle of nowhere, hosted by nobody? I was already starting to regret abandoning my resolve to live the semester as a hermit.\n\n“None of this is creeping you out? What does it mean by ‘Culling,’ anyway?” \n\n“Ah, it’s just for dramatics. See who can stick it out all night, ya know? Maybe there’ll be a prize. And you know what?” He grinned and slapped me on the thigh. I slapped him back. “We’re not gonna pussy out. We’ll be the winners, last ones standing, just like old times. You with me?”\n\n“I turn into a pumpkin after 2.”\n\n“I’m serious, Lou.”\n\n“So am I, *Alexander.*” He knew I hated being called Lou. Chel always called me Lou. “Besides, are they even going to let me in? I didn’t get one of these.” I shook the invitation in his face. \n\nI was starting to have a really bad feeling. If I’d known about all this weirdness beforehand, I would’ve already been in bed. Tossing and turning on my lumpy twin mattress, brainstorming ways to beg Professor Dickson for yet another extension on my first paper, sounded better than stumbling into the plot of *Texas Chainsaw Massacre*.\n\n“C’mon, Louise, if it’s lame, we’ll bail. And they’ll definitely let you in. I mean, you look just like her, they’ll -”\n\n“Feel sorry for me?”\n\nI took grim satisfaction seeing the smile slip off his face. \n\n“No, absolutely not.” His lips pulled down into a frown and I looked away. “Louise,” his large hand grasped my fingers gently. His voice had gone soft.  “I just mean that everybody loved Chel, and they’ll love you too. Just like she did.” \n\nI looked out the window and blinked hard once, twice, before clearing my throat. \n\n“Fine. But the *second* I’m ready to leave, we’re leaving, prize be damned.”\n\nAlex squeezed my hand and let go. “Deal.”\n\nWe continued the drive in silence. Alex drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and I scanned the empty fields on the side of the road. We’d pulled off on the county road over 10 minutes ago; we’d almost missed the turn-off, which was only marked by a small, weathered wood sign, embossed with a gold Omega symbol. There was still no sign of a party.\n\n“Alex…”\n\nAlex shifted in the driver’s seat and hunched over the steering wheel, squinting into the darkness.\n\n“Yeah...it’s uh...I feel like we should have seen it by now.”\n\nHe laughed, high-pitched and thready. I continued unraveling the loose thread on the hem of Chel’s sweater.\n\nThe BMW crested a large hill, and I let out a breath I hadn’t known I was holding. A large, white farmhouse stood in the valley below us, a fleet of Land Rovers and Mercedes parked haphazardly in the grass out front.  Alex laughed - much more genuinely, this time - and patted my knee as he parked next to a Lexus.\n\n“Relax, it’s gonna be fun.”\n\nI mustered up a smile but didn’t say anything. Alex grinned and hopped out of the car. I peered up at the house. The facade was bright and cheery, freshly painted with bright blue shutters flanking the windows, the front door a bubbly yellow. The interior, glimpsed through the open blinds, looked warm and inviting, and I could already feel the bass beat of a shitty pop song vibrating softly in my chest. It all looked pretty innocuous. Maybe I could have a good time. For Alex. \n\n*For Chel.*\n\nThe loud clunk of the passenger door opening startled me. Alex arched his eyebrow, forearm braced on the roof of the car.\n\n“Are you coming, or were you planning to wait in the car all night?”\n\nI rolled my eyes and unbuckled. I socked him on the arm as I climbed out of the car.\n\n“Let’s have some fun or whatever.”\n\nI didn’t need to worry about getting in the door. There was nobody checking invitations. We were greeted by a loud cheer of “Alex!” when we entered the living room, the party well underway.\n\nA few guys ran up, thumping Alex on the back and nodding my way in polite acknowledgement. I was suddenly enveloped in a bear hug by a man whose name I couldn’t remember, overwhelmed by a cloud of Axe and sour beer-breath.\n\n“We’re so glad you could make it, Lou. We miss Chel so much.”\n\nA chorus of drunk voices chimed in, booming in the small space of the foyer.\n\n“CHEL!”\n\nSour-breath let me go to pump his fist in the air, and the boys all started chanting Chel’s name. I couldn’t decide whether I was endeared or disgusted. Alex flushed and elbowed one of his brothers in the ribs. I was about to give him shit when another, much more slender arm wrapped around my shoulders.\n\n“Oh, Louise! I didn’t know you were going to be here.” \n\nAnna, the president of Chel’s sorority, had to crouch down to hug me. Her words were slurred, her movements languid and clumsy, but her big brown eyes were clear and focused when she pulled back. Anna had always liked Chel, took her under her wing when she first started pledging, and she’d always made me feel welcome in the house. So it was out of the ordinary that she looked concerned, rather than pleased, to see me.\n\n“Uh...yeah. Alex said it would be cool?” I glared in Alex’s direction. He just shrugged.\n\nAnna’s brow furrowed, but before she could answer, another voice chimed in, rich and melodic.\n\n“Oh? I didn’t realize this was Alex’s party.”\n\nAnna froze, and her eyes widened. Slowly, she turned to face three of the most beautiful women I had ever seen in my entire life. Despite their striking appearance, I don’t know that I could describe any of them now; it’s all kind of fuzzy in my memory, but I do know that they were supermodel tall, willowy, with bright eyes that seemed to stare right through you. One of the women - sparkling green eyes boring into mine - spoke again in the same resonant tone.\n\n“Anna? Who’s your party-crasher friend?”\n\nShe smiled when she said it, and her tone betrayed no ill will, but I still shrank back behind Anna instinctually. I looked around again for Alex, but he had wandered off already. That set off distant alarm bells in my head, after all his promises that we would stick together, but I couldn’t focus on anything but the woman in front of me. Anna grabbed my hand and squeezed it tightly.\n\n“Oh, uh...this is, you remember Chel, the girl I told you about? This is her sister, Louise, and...well, I  think Alex just thought...”\n\nAnother of the three women, grey eyes this time, stepped around Anna in one smooth motion, interrupting her rambling. She grabbed my hand out of Anna’s and clasped it between both of her own. Her skin was cool, almost cold, but her grip was soft. I thought I was just rocking a stupid crush at the time, but the world seemed to tilt off center when she bent down to meet me at eye-level, voice whisper-soft yet strong enough to carry over the house music thumping through the floorboards.\n\n“Darling, I’m so sorry about your sister, but I’m really not sure this party is your scene.”\n\nAnna looked downright panicked by this point, falling all over herself to apologize to the trio. I scanned the crowd and, aside from Alex and a couple of his fraternity brothers, I only saw one other person at the party who looked familiar, a girl from Chel and Anna’s sorority - Beth? Stacy? - who I knew almost nothing about. Chel had never introduced me to her. A distant part of me registered that I should be embarrassed, or, that if Anna was panicking, maybe I should be too. Instead, I felt a strange sense of calm, content to follow wherever that voice might lead me.\n\n“Of course, I didn’t mean to cause any trouble…”\n\nThe third woman stepped forward and rested a graceful hand lightly on my shoulder. Bright blue eyes danced kindly. I couldn’t look away.\n\n“No trouble at all, sweetheart, just let me walk you to your car.”\n\nAnna looked on helplessly as the two women guided me slowly to the door. A tiny splinter of logic somehow managed to pierce the haze that had settled over my brain.\n\n“I don’t have a car. Alex drove me.”\n\nGrey-eyes and blue-eyes looked at each other for a few minutes, seeming to have a silent conversation. Blue-eyes finally sighed and turned back to me. \n\n“Well then, I guess there’s nothing for it. Want to keep me company in the kitchen?”\n\nI could feel the dopey grin splitting my face, but I couldn’t do anything to stop it. I nodded a bit too enthusiastically to be cool. Blue-eyes laughed; it sounded like bells. My mind sunk deeper into the fog.\n\nIt didn’t even cross my mind to go find Alex. I forgot about Anna’s frantic worry from just moments before. I let blue-eyes take my hand and lead me further into the house. I felt safe while I was with her. A peace I hadn’t felt since Chel’s death washed over me.\n\nThe next day, as the memories came back to me in flashes, I would realize how... *off* everything was. The whole house had this shimmery glow about it, like something out of a dream.  Alex’s fraternity brothers and the handful of girls from Chel’s sorority drank from seemingly bottomless red Solo cups and danced feverishly in the living room, pressed tightly together in a writhing mass; the rest of the partygoers did shot after shot in the kitchen, a never ending supply of vodka and tequila flowing freely, poured generously by the mysterious Sisters of House Omega. The Sisters themselves, each as stunningly gorgeous as the last, stood around the party’s periphery, laughing easily at the revelry without actually partaking in any of it themselves. All the while, those piercing eyes swept over the party with a calculated, unsettling intensity. \n\nHindsight, of course, is 20\/20. At the time, I was too swept up myself, too enraptured by ocean blue eyes, to notice anything odd.\n\nI wish I could remember her name. Blue-eyes. In spite of everything that happened, I still find myself yearning to know more about her. She pulled me into a cozy bench seat in the corner of the kitchen, away from the worst of the noise. She tucked a stray hair behind my ear with long, graceful fingers, and the whole world fell away. She asked me to tell her all about myself. So I did.\n\nI poured my heart out. I told her about what it was like coming out in high school in a small town in the Midwest, and how supportive Chel always was, even when Alex wigged out and didn’t talk to me for a month. I told her about my dreams of becoming a songwriter and making a break for the coast, about how that dream died with Chel because I couldn’t imagine anybody else singing my songs but her. I told her about all of my hopes and my desires, about my guilt at moving on to live a life that Chel and I had always planned to live together. I told her about my deepest fear: that I don’t know who I am without my twin sister, my other half. That maybe without Chel, I’m nothing at all. \n\nLooking back on it, I can’t remember what blue-eyes actually said to me throughout all of this. She certainly didn’t give away anything about herself, who she was, where she came from - not even her name. But I remember this overwhelming sense of comfort, of her telling me, maybe not in so many words, that I was *somebody*; I was important, I mattered. Even though she didn’t - couldn’t have - known me, somehow she *did*, and she loved me. She held me as I laughed and cried, and it felt like she was laughing and crying with me, feeling everything I felt just as deeply. \n\nThe next part gets even fuzzier. At some point, blue-eyes took my hand and invited me upstairs. Usually this is the part where I lose my cool, especially with a woman so gut-wrenchingly beautiful, but the nerves never came. I felt like I was floating all the way up the stairs, to her room, to the edge of her twin bed. When she finally kissed me and pressed me back into soft sheets, galaxies exploded behind my closed eyes.\n\nIt didn’t go any farther than that, but it was somehow the most intimate experience of my life. I have no idea how long we stayed there, arms around each other, lips sliding together softly, sweetly. At some point, she pulled away to give me another of those deep, searching looks.. She opened her mouth as if to speak when, somewhere in the house, a clock started to chime midnight. \n\nHer head snapped toward the door. She ducked her head and sighed.\n\n“Wait here, Lou.”\n\nI nodded; it wasn’t a question. There was nowhere else I wanted to be. With one last press of her lips to mine, she was gone.\n\nI flopped back onto the bed, idly wondering how long she would be gone and what we might get up to when she got back. Before I could follow that train of thought too far, a high-pitched, harsh shriek rent the night, painfully loud even over the pounding baseline from downstairs. More inhuman, screeching voices soon joined in.\n\nI shot up in bed just as the dance music cut out with the painfully grating sound of feedback from the speakers. There was a series of terrible, thundering crashes, and a chorus of panicked screams sounded from the partygoers below.\n\nThe peaceful veil clouding my thoughts lifted in an instant. It finally caught up to me how *wrong* the situation was. I didn’t even really remember coming upstairs, and I hadn’t seen Alex in hours…\n\n*Shit, Alex is down there.*\n\nI ran to the door, but it wouldn’t budge. Distantly, I thought I could hear Alex screaming my name, scared and in pain, and I started slamming my body into the door, calling out for him until my voice was shredded. I looked around frantically for my phone, but it wasn’t anywhere in the room. I couldn’t remember where I had left it. Footsteps pounded down the hallway outside, a terrified scream coming closer, abruptly silenced when something slammed into the other side of the bedroom door with a wet, heavy thud. I stumbled back until my knees hit the edge of the bed. \n\nI sobbed and made a break for the windows instead. I was just about to take my chances jumping from the second story when a small TV in the corner of the room switched on, static buzzing at the highest volume. Half-wild, I thought briefly of chucking the whole TV through the windowpane before the blurred pixels started to resolve into a familiar face.\n\n“No…”\n\nThere on the TV, impossibly, was Chel. My escape plan was quickly abandoned. I reached out to the screen with shaking fingers, as though I could reach through the cold glass and touch her face. \n\nThe scene on the TV started to play. I couldn’t look away.\n\nChel was at a party in what I recognized as the basement of Alex’s fraternity house. She was trashed, drink sloshing over the rim of her cup onto her sweater. The sweater I was wearing that night. Alex stepped into frame, laughing, and poured more liquor into her cup.\n\n“Easy, Chel, you’re going to lose the rest of your drink!”\n\n“Can’t have that!” whooped a frat brother in the background. Alex turned and shot him a glare.\n\n“When are the other girls gonna get here?” Chel’s voice was slurred, mumbling. “Is Lou still coming?”\n\nA chorus of giggles sounded from the small handful of girls in the background. I recognized Beth\/Stacy as one of the onlookers. Alex looked back at the crowd and swallowed. He smiled wanly at Chel.\n\n“Yeah, Chel, she’s on her way. Listen - how about we play a game while we wait for her?”\n\nMy stomach felt like stone, bile clawing up the back of my throat. Distantly, I could still hear the rampage continuing in the house around me. Wails of pain and fear, shrieks of rage and triumph, and under it all, a thick, fleshy ripping sound. \n\n“A game?” Chel looked at Alex with unfocused eyes, brow furrowed. Something was seriously wrong. Chel never got that drunk.\n\n“Yeah, it’ll be fun!” The men were circling up around Chel on the TV. The hair on my arms and neck stood up. Somebody in the real world was pounding on the door to the room, begging for help, but they sounded distorted and far away, like my head was in a fishbowl. \n\n“I don’t know, Alex, I don’t feel so good.” Chel swayed on her feet. Alex was practically holding her upright. \n\n“It’s OK, Chel, just one quick game and then we’re done, OK?” \n\nAlex was smoothing Chel’s hair away from her face, almost tenderly. The ugly, sinister anticipation in my gut was building. Chel and Alex always had a bit of a thing, but this didn’t seem like their usual flirting; it was a mockery of the sweet way Alex usually treated Chel. His eyes were filled with an odd mix of determination and regret, lust and anxiety.\n\nThe Chel on the TV was too far gone to have any of those same misgivings. Chel was always too trusting of people, quick to see the good in everyone. She smiled broadly and dropped her head onto Alex’s shoulder, wrapping her arms around him in a loose hug. Alex’s frat brothers were circling like sharks. I wrapped my arms around my own waist and fell to my knees, tears streaming down my face.\n\n“Spin the Chel!” somebody yelled. Chel looked up, confused, and Alex grimaced and spun her quickly in a circle. She stumbled into the arms of another fraternity brother. She tried to push at him, but her movements were slow and weak. The guy forcibly kissed her, and then shoved her back toward Alex, who did the same. This continued, Chel tossed about like a ragdoll, sobbing my name in fear and confusion. She looked so lost, so *young*. I quit watching as soon as more hands started grabbing at her, pulling at her clothes. It wasn’t hard to guess what happened next.\n\nI covered my ears and hunched in on myself on the floor, screaming, begging for it all to stop. \n\nI don’t know how long I stayed there. I didn’t even notice that everything had gone quiet until I heard the click of the bedroom door opening behind me. It was loud as a gunshot in the sudden silence. I stood up slowly and moved toward the door in a daze.\n\nI stepped forward and barely registered the sick squelch of the rug under my feet. Red soaked the floor and the bottom 18 inches of the wallpaper, splattered in wide strokes on the upper walls and ceiling. A pile of gore that had once been a person slumped at the top of the stairs. A river of blood ran down the center of the staircase, thick and dark, flowing like a grisly red carpet to the open front door.\n\nI stepped around mangled limbs and stringy viscera as I made my way carefully down the stairs. My mind was completely numb to the carnage; the sound of Chel’s helpless tears still filled my ears. Two steps from the front door, a faint voice gurgled to my left.\n\n“Lou…”\n\nPart of me wanted to ignore him. To just walk back out into the night, down County Road 5, back to my tiny, uncomfortable bed in my shitty dorm room, where I would fall asleep and this would all have been a nightmare. \n\n“Please*,* Lou.”\n\nMovements rigid, I forced myself to turn toward the living room. My breath hitched in spite of my detachment.\n\nThere, on the floor in the middle of a sea of shredded bodies, was what was left of Alex. His blond hair was tinged pink with blood. One of his eyes dangled loosely from its socket; both legs were missing below the knees. He dragged himself toward me with his right arm, nails cracking against the hardwood floor. His left arm, flesh ripped down to bone and sinew, reached out for me, pleading.\n\nI didn’t move. I couldn’t. This was Alex - my best friend since kindergarten, Chel’s prom date, my first and last kiss with a man. This was *Alex*. The man who threw my sister to the wolves. Who raped her. \n\nThe reason Chel was dead. \n\n“Did Chel say *please*, Alex? \n\nAlex choked on a bloody sob. I could see the guilt and shame awash in his one good eye.\n\n“It wasn’t s’posed...go that far.” He coughed; blood spewed in a chunky froth across the hardwood. “*Please*, Lou, ‘m sorry.”\n\nGroaning in agony, Alex inched closer to me. I remained still, body frozen with indecision.\n\n“Shall we spare him?”\n\nIce trickled down my spine. The voice belonged to blue-eyes, there was no doubt, but it was different; a sonorous, echoing whisper, sighing on the wind like it came from everywhere at once.\n\nA long-fingered hand settled on my shoulder. In the corner of my vision, I saw shiny curved, black talons resting near my collarbone. Just around the corners of the living room entryway, beyond my line of sight, I could make out the shadows of huge wings. Feathers rustled, claws tapped and clicked on the hardwood floor, impatient. Alex looked toward the noise, face twisted in fright. Blue-eyes squeezed my shoulder gently.\n\n“I’m sorry, child. You weren’t supposed to be here. But we wanted you to understand.”\n\nAlex looked at me again, pleading. He opened his mouth to speak, but I beat him to it.\n\n“He’s all yours.”\n\nAs whatever monsters lurked in the shadows began to advance, the hand on my shoulder turned me away and steered me toward the door. Smooth, black feathers filled my peripheral vision, a large wing curled around my frame to block the sights and muffle the sounds of my former best friend’s demise. I stepped into the cool night air and closed my eyes. Lips brushed tenderly across my temple. \n\n“Be at peace, dear one.”\n\nEverything went black.\n\nI woke up late last Sunday morning, back in the dorms, tucked safely into my bed. For a couple of hours, I almost convinced myself I had dreamed the whole thing. Every trace of the House Omega party has been scrubbed from existence - all of my text messages with Alex about it were gone, none of the sleek, black invitations remained. I thought briefly, hopefully, that maybe it had all just been a grief-induced nightmare.\n\nUntil the news broke that Alex’s entire fraternity and a handful of Chel’s sorority sisters had disappeared into the ether overnight.\n\nThe police have no leads. I know they won’t find any. I drove back out to County Road 5 a few days ago, after half a week of fielding concerned phone calls from my mom. There’s nothing there; just an empty field with an abandoned, decrepit farmhouse rotting in the prairie sun.\n\nAlex’s mom has been calling me, too. To see if I’ve heard from him, if I have any clue what happened. I haven’t told her the truth. I’ve decided that I won’t. Sometimes lies are kinder. She doesn’t need to know what kind of monster her son was, what kind of monster he was killed by.\n\nI spent most of the day today at the cemetery. I sat cross-legged in front of Chel’s headstone, tracing the letters of her name and thinking of everything I should have seen earlier, everything I missed. A shadow fell over me, breaking my reverie. \n\n“Mind if I join you?”\n\nI squinted up into the afternoon sun. It was Anna. With everything else that had been going on, I had almost forgotten that she had even been there that night. I guess I had subconsciously catalogued her as one of missing. Apparently, officially speaking, she was never at the party either.\n\nShe helped fill in some of the gaps.\n\n“Chel came to me, right after it happened,” Anna said, voice tight. She sat down beside me in the grass, close enough our thighs were touching. “I was furious, ready to call campus police, but she begged me not to. The boys, and some of our so-called sisters, had taken video of the whole thing, she said, and threatened to expose her if she got ‘too sensitive’ about it. I promised her I wouldn’t call. I wish every night that I had anyway.\n\nI had decided I would connect her with campus resources instead, you know? Support groups for survivors, counselors, that kind of thing. I convinced myself it was good enough. But before I could make it happen she..” Anna choked on the words. She cleared her throat and breathed out harshly through her nose. “Well, I was too late. I would apologize to you, but an apology isn’t good enough.”\n\n“You have nothing to apologize for, Anna. You tried to help her.” I squeezed her hand. She squeezed mine back.\n\n“Still, I felt like I had to do *something*.” Anna stared at Chel’s headstone, eyes hard. “People like the men and women who hurt your sister, they think they’re invincible. Untouchable. And they’re not entirely wrong these days. With enough money, you can get away with anything, right?” She laughed, dry and humorless. “So I knew I had to reach out to a higher authority.”\n\n“What did you do?”\n\nAnna smiled grimly. “My family worships the old gods.” I shivered at that, a chill dancing across my skin. “I called upon a long-forgotten sisterhood, ancient and hungry. If I could deliver them the guilty parties, they promised they could deliver justice.” Her expression softened as she finally looked at me. “You were never supposed to be there, though. Oh, honey, I am so, so sorry.”\n\nI didn’t tell her it was okay, because it really isn't. But I appreciated her apology nonetheless. I nodded and squeezed her hand again, blinking back tears.\n\n“So...what now?”\n\n“The deed is done.” Anna stood up and dusted the grass off of the back of her leggings. “They’ll have moved on.” Anna looked at me, long and hard, and bit her lip. She nodded to herself, and reached into her purse. “They did ask me to make one last delivery, though.”\n\nAnna pulled out a very familiar piece of black cardstock, embossed with gilded lettering. She handed it to me. I took it with a trembling hand.\n\n“There’s no pressure, and no expiration date,” Anna said. She started to go, but turned back one last time with a sad, sweet smile. “I really am sorry, Lou. For everything. Chel was the best of us.”\n\nI waited until her figure faded into the distance to look down at the paper in my hands. It was a new invitation, to me, this time:\n\n*Louise Teller*  \n*True of heart and strong of will,*  \n*The Sisters of House Omega invite you into our fold.*  \n*A black candle to summon us; a white candle to turn us away.*  \n*We will heed your call.*\n\nI thought of Chel, crying and confused, stumbling in a dark basement. I thought of Chel, the last time I’d seen her in life, head thrown back and laughing. I thought of Chel, cold and still in the ground beneath me. I crumpled the invitation in my fist.\n\nIt’s quiet tonight; not even a breeze rustles the dying leaves. And yet, a soft wind is disturbing the flame of the black candle I’ve placed in front of my open window. A low, sweet voice floats on the breeze, speaking an old language, and feathers flutter in the dark just past my line of vision.\n\nI was never the type to join a sorority. But I think there might be something to this whole sisterhood thing after all."},"260":{"title":"My Husband Brought Home a Fake Daughter","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/bblq6d\/my_husband_brought_home_a_fake_daughter\/","flair":null,"author":"lifeisstrangemetoo","selftext":"*This is not my child.*\n\nThat was all I could think. \n\n“Honey?” said my husband. “Is everything all right?”\n\n“Who is this?” I said, staring at the little girl I’d never seen before, standing in my house, dressed in my daughter’s clothes. “Where is Liza?”\n\nMy husband gave me a worried look, and the girl-who-was-not-Liza looked positively terrified. \n\n“What do you mean?” said my husband. “Are you feeling all right?”\n\n*Why was he evading my question? Why couldn’t he just answer?* I took a deep breath, tried to remain calm.\n\n“I’ll be all right,” I said, “as soon as you tell me where my daughter is.”\n\nMy husband frowned, and the little girl’s eyes welled up with moisture. My husband placed a protective hand over her shoulder, and leaned down to whisper in her ear. \n\n“Go on upstairs, honey,” he said. “Mommy’s not feeling well.”\n\nThe girl wasted no time in doing what he said. She clutched her schoolbooks to her chest and barreled past me, rushing up the stairs. I heard the door of my daughter’s room slam. The look on my husband’s face was a mix of pity and restrained anger.\n\n“You haven’t been taking your medication,” he said. “Don’t try to deny it, I can see it in your eyes.”\n\nI waved my hand in a dismissive gesture. \n\n“I don’t need them,” I said. “They make my mind all fuzzy.”\n\nThe anger on my husband’s face became less restrained. Well-etched frown lines beneath his lips deepened. \n\n“Do you remember what happened the last time you said that?” he asked. \n\n“I...”\n\nThe suggestion was enough. A swarm of shattered and confused images flooded my mind, like the wave of nausea that comes before vomit. My husband screaming, covered in blood.\n\n*Look what you made me do!* he was shrieking. *Look what you made me do!*\n\nI felt the floor tilt beneath me, and before I knew what had happened, I found myself falling backwards into my husbands arms. Hot tears were streaming down my cheeks, and my body convulsed with violent sobs.\n\nMy husband gently brushed my hair and whispered in my ear.\n\n“Shhh,” he cooed. “It’s not real, honey. I promise that it’s not real.”\n\nI silently nodded my assent. I let him carry me up to our bedroom and lay me gently down on the bed. He walked over to the dresser where he kept the cocktail of drugs that I took every day to maintain my sanity. I swallowed them gratefully. \n\nSoon my mind was going fuzzy, I could feel myself becoming a pliable zombie that could be told anything, made to do anything. \n\nOf course I knew that it was wrong, that that girl was not Liza. I knew that it wasn’t me who had been driven insane by our daughter’s death, but my husband. I knew he had kidnapped that girl when she was a toddler, and brainwashed her into believing she was Liza.\n\nBut, most importantly, I knew that if I didn’t take my pills, if I shattered his precariously built illusion, that he would kill the girl and start all over again.\n\nJust like he did the last time.\n\n[x](http:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/lifeisstrangemetoo)"},"261":{"title":"The previous tenant of my new flat left a survival guide.

Once the postman had left and I was alone with my thoughts they just continued to get louder. \n\nI thought about Natalia and the cult. About the kids and their nighttime antics. About the committee meeting. Jamie and how much I missed him, Georgia and my burning guilt and Mr Prentice, who was finally making those aforementioned animal noises.\n\nMost of all I thought about the note left for me on move in day. How it had changed everything. My whole life was different now, I was alone and it felt like my new home was attacking from every angle. \n\nI re read the note a few times over my coffee. I worried about my rent, it was tight but manageable. School is currently out in the uk but as a training teacher assigned to a school I still get paid a small amount through the summer. The rent is low and with a second summer job I can just about make it without Jamie. \n\nIt sounds strange. But it felt nice to worry about something normal for a minute; even if I should have been worrying about my survival and the many entities currently trying to kill me. \n\nI didn’t get to stew for too long, I had to get ready for the committee meeting. After the events of the night before and my growing mistrust of prudence it was imperative that I got the neighbours on side if I was going to achieve anything like my goals of eradicating the imposter\/cultist neighbours. \n\nThe meeting was at noon in flat 31, there was a poster on a communal notice board by the entrance that I was glad to spot, Terri hadn’t mentioned the time when we met and all our meetings since had been a bit hectic to discuss it. The poster promised tea and cakes and my stomach rumbled at the thought, I hadn’t eaten properly in days.  \n\nAt 11.55 I left the flat, and wandered out into the corridor. I’d never seen so many neighbours. Mr Prentice, however, was still making that awful noise and I watched in disbelief as every single person in the corridor walked past his door as if it was silent. \n\nI did my usual deliberation on whether to take the stairs or lift but yet again the stairs won. I still couldn’t bear being where Jamie died and all these extra flights were keeping me fit.\n\nFlat 31 belonged to an older lady named Molly Thompson and her husband Eric. She had a blue rinsed head of curls attached to her head and had gone to the effort to make homemade batten-burg cake. Other neighbours had bought along baked goods as well. It reminded me of a school fair.\n\nThe flat itself was decorated for the 70s, with plenty of china cat ornaments littered around. I sat down on a dusty plastic garden chair, one of many that Molly seemed to have acquired and laid out for the residents pouring in. I hadn’t seen community spirit like this in my life. \n\nI smiled as I saw Terri, Eddie and Ellie wander in. It was nice to see some familiar faces. I had noticed people looking at me, wondering who I was. It probably wasn’t often they got new neighbours. Eddie came running up to me, swung his arms round me and sat down in the rickety garden chair next to mine. It was so sweet. Terri smiled at me and took a seat the other side of mine, Ellie sat next to her brother. The brown puppy dog eyes were back. No claws.\n\n“I’m glad you came!” Terri said to me, loud enough to hear over the voices of the other neighbours. “I really want you to see the good side of the block. We don’t bite really!” She laughed nervously as she realised the irony of her statement. \n\n“Terri I need help, we need to stop those people from coming back again and from terrorising people. The block can’t go on like this.” I wanted to make the purpose of my attendance clear to her, it was time for things to change. \n\n“But if you don’t let them in then they don’t bother you. I’ve spoken to the kids, they know not to do it again, that those people are dangerous.” She paused for a moment and sighed. “Although them running away didn’t help, the kids think they’re indestructible now. They’ve been telling me all morning that they’re going to kill the bad guys.” \n\nShe looked so resigned. But it was true, they did run away from the twins. Maybe there was something in that, I knew they could die I just had to work out how. But as the thought crossed my mind and I looked at Eddie and Ellie, I couldn’t imagine taking the risk.\n\nI could’ve flat out gone back and asked Prudence. But to be honest I didn’t want anything to do with her. She gave me such a bad feeling. I was doubting everything she told me.\n\n“It doesn’t matter if you can keep them away. We can’t all live in fear. Yours aren’t the only kids in this building.” I knew this from surveying the room. “But I bet not all the kids here are as ... special ... as yours. What if another family burns to death because their kids were hyper one night.”\n\nI could see this struck a chord with Terri. She looked at me with glassy eyes as if on the verge of tears. \n\n“You’re right. Molly’s the chairwoman and she can be a little strict but you can bring it up under any other business.” She spoke with a lump in her throat. “Here you go by the way.” She handed me a piece of printed paper. \n\nAny other business felt a bit lacklustre but it would do. As long as it got discussed. \n\nI turned my attention the the piece of paper, it was the agenda for the meeting. For something written so formally it appeared farcical. It seemed other flats and floors had different but equally strange issues to mine. \n\nThere were only 6 items on the agenda for the meeting with AOB as the 7th. They were as follows. \n\n*1. Welcome and introductions with apologies for absence.*\n\n*2. Replacing of the flickering lights on floor 11, it seems to incite vicious behaviour from the pets and elderly of that floor.*\n\n*3. Serving a formal residents letter of concern to the man who doesn’t move from the bottom of the stairwell on floor 5.*\n\n*4. Finances - budgets for general maintenance and the annual barbecue.*\n\n*5. The stairs with no grip leading up to floor 14 at the very top and the health and safety hazards this presents.*\n\n*6. Soundproofing of Mr Prentice’s flat, number 48.*\n\nI was comforted to know that I wasn’t alone in dealing with all these strange occurrences. I was also chilled to the core to know for certain that it was the entire building that was more than a bit odd. \n\nWhat really struck me as odd is that when I thought about it, I had seen that man on floor 5 when going down the stairs. But I’d never noticed that it had been every time, or that he had never moved, until this moment. \n\nThe meeting begun with a loud and dissatisfying clink. \n\nBy this point the tiny, 70s themed flat was packed. Garden chairs had all ran out and people were standing. Molly Thompson stood up from her floral patterned arm chair and bashed a teaspoon against the outside of her cup. \n\nShe reminded me of a very strict, disciplinarian school teacher I had worked with during my university placement. She commanded quiet in the room. \n\n“I think we should get started everyone!” She shrilled, her voice growing louder with every word until the crowd came to a silent hum.\n\n“Right, firstly, we are not going to skip the introductions today. Apologies have been given by Jo and Steph of flat 2 and yet again by Mr Prentice. We have a new face in the room as I’m sure many of you have noticed.” She gestured to me and looked in my direction but didn’t really make any eye contact. She was just talking about me as I sat in the room. Eventually she addressed me directly. \n\n“Stand up dear, introduce yourself. We’re pleased to have you here.”\n\nI was deeply uncomfortable. I could feel some sort of panic coming on. I never liked standing in crowds very much. But I stood up anyway. \n\n“Ermm, hi. My name is Kat. I live in flat number 42, I moved in with my boyfriend Jamie but he was killed in the lift by the weird rat creatures you people have living here. The people that claim to live in the burned out flats won’t leave me alone and one in particular seems to want me dead. Oh, and that window cleaner outside my flat makes me want to scoop my own eyes out with a spoon every time he knocks on the door. Nice to meet you all.” The crowd had gasped a little.\n\nI sat down. Instantly mortified, I don’t know what happened, the normality and structure of the meeting overwhelmed me. There’s something about a sense of order and normality amongst chaos. It does something to your brain, and for me, for the first time in this whole journey, it sent me into a meltdown. \n\nI sobbed as I hit the chair, both in pure mental exhaustion and disappointment that I had blown my chance at building any sort of army against Natalia. Terri rubbed my shoulder. Molly broke the awkward silence that had blanketed the room. \n\n“Nice to meet you Katherine, I understand life in this building can be a little overwhelming. We did ask the previous occupant to let us intervene when you moved in but she was insistent. In hindsight we may need to review our policies on new tenants. I am so very sorry for the loss of your partner. The lift is a most unfortunate situation.”\n\nShe had been in positions of power in her life for certain, she responded professionally but coldly, there was no feeling in her condolences. She came off like a corrupt politician digging themselves out of a hole. She did decide to skip the introductions after my outburst.\n\nI also hate it when I’m called Katherine. My parents named me Katie and I shorten it to Kat. Her presuming it was Katherine added to her school teacher demeanour. \n\nShe carried on with the proceedings pretty swiftly and interesting characters present at the meeting started to emerge. \n\nMy favourite was a large middle aged Caribbean woman named Precious St Fluer who would not accept Molly’s claims that there was not enough in the budget to replace the lighting on floor 11.  \n\nShe got up and lifted her shirt to reveal a large deep bite mark across her stomach caused by her dog after a long episode of the lights flickering. When that didn’t change Molly’s answer she lifted her trouser leg to reveal a smaller, but still noteworthy bite mark on her leg, from her elderly mother who lives with her. Molly didn’t budge.\n\nIt took what felt like an eternity to get to any other business. If I weren’t so focused on my goal I would have enjoyed hearing about the quirks of the other floors, maybe tried to engage a little, but I just couldn’t concentrate. \n\nWhen the chairwoman asked if anyone had any other business she scanned the room quickly. I stood up from my chair and she locked in on me with her eyes. \n\nMy hands were shaking and I could feel a cold sweat forming all over my body.\n\n“Katherine, what can we help you with dear?” She asked in a patronising tone. \n\n“I want help in getting rid of the people pretending to be from the burned out flats. I can’t be the only person that doesn’t like living in fear.” I stated boldly, trying not to break down again.\n\n“Dear we have had this discussion multiple times and it’s been taken off the agenda. I am aware you’re new here but there is nothing we can do about certain problems within this building and for this particular issue we would appreciate you not letting them into your home and ignoring them like the rest of us.” She snapped back. \n\n“But that’s not good enough! Terri’s kids answered the door last night, they’re children, it’s easily done, what if someone else’s child does it and aren’t so lucky to survive. One burned my friend so bad a few nights ago that she’s still unconscious in hospital.” This I knew from social media. \n\nA few people called out in agreement with me from the crowd. \n\n“The only one who has ever been able to deal with them is Prudence. And that difficult woman never revealed her methods. Don’t think we didn’t try. You’re suggesting a suicide mission. You’d do well to remember you are new here.” Molly hissed through her teeth. \n\nDid she have to mention I was new so many times. It was grating on me. \n\n“Well I’m willing!” Shouted Precious. She seemed stronger than the rest in her earlier rant. I was glad to have her on side. \n\nWhere she came forward, a few others followed. Soon I had 5 people plus myself willing to form a sub committee to get rid of the cultists. Molly didn’t like it but she agreed to let us do it.\n\nThere was me, Precious and Terri along with lady named Shanti who lived a few doors from me. \n\nA man named Anton and his friend Leo from floor 8 made up the group. To be honest they just seemed keen to get involved with any kind of battle. Leo was the loud one, Anton was mostly silent. \n\nI invited them to my flat after Molly swiftly adjourned the meeting. Inviting anyone into my home made me anxious now. I found myself studying each of their faces to ensure they’re weren’t too average and I hadn’t invited the wrong people in. I was fairly certain I hadn’t. Eddie and Ellie settled in front of my tv in the bedroom so they didn’t hear our conversation. They may only be kids but I felt safer with them there. \n\nWe discussed for hours how we could bring the imposter people into one place and kill them all. \n\nLeo was particularly creative, he came up with weird and whacky ways to end them; from locking them in a room and blasting with fire extinguishers until they freeze, to herding them into the lift between 1.11 and 3.33 am.\n\nThe whole time I waited nervously for a knock on the door, for them to come for us. But they didn’t. We got time to plan. But despite the time it never really took off, no idea seemed feasible. \n\nI shared everything I knew. My conversation with Prue, the night before in Terri’s flat... everything. Precious listened to my tales intently before speaking.\n\n“Derek would have helped us. He was a great man, he used to turn up at my door in the dead of the night just as those lights started and take my dog for a walk.” She spoke of the gardener with a fondness. \n\n“Prudence told me about Derek. She said he’s been gone since the garden was demolished.” I replied flatly. \n\n“It was awful when he left. That woman that used to live here was nasty to him. I watched out my window as she tore up the garden. I know she was grieving for that little girl but I know Derek only ever wanted to help.” Shanti spoke up from the corner. She had been pretty quiet the whole time. “He was the whole reason we don’t have those awful creatures from the lift all over our homes anymore. My brother was killed by one before the agreement. He was 4 years old.”\n\nI twitched as she told her story. Shanti has such sad eyes and speaking about her brother only filled them further with sadness.\n\n“This is another thing I don’t understand. Why have any agreement, if you managed to kill most of them, why not all?” I asked, feeling anger over Jamie burn through my throat as I spoke. \n\nPrecious laughed. Terri shot her a look from across the room. \n\n“No ones told you the whole story have they?” Shanti asked, a single tear running down her face. \n\n“What do you mean?” This was driving me insane, nothing was simple, how could I trust anyone. \n\n“When Prudence and some of the others killed the creatures they killed a large group of them in one hit. They had started to work out that food scraps and pet food were attracting them and they gathered all the pet food in the tower block into one empty flat on the floor the fire had happened. They creatures came in droves just like expected and they set the flat alight. Again.\n\n“The flat was burned to ash on top of preexisting ash. Nothing could survive that.” Shanti was interrupted after this by Leo. \n\n“And then 3 giant rat motherfuckers literally rose from the ashes, triple as smart and strong and fucked shit up!” He said, a look of excitement on his face. \n\nShanti rolled her eyes and continued. “So all Prudence did was cause a quite literally bigger problem. She didn’t kill them, all she did was help them evolve.\n\n“There was only three of them but they learned to sneak attack. More people died than during the original infestation. They were more intelligent but not in the way it comes across when the agreements spoken about. We couldn’t speak to or reason with them.”\n\nTerri was looking at the floor. \n\n“Only Derek was able to do that, he spoke to them like he spoke to the garden. He made it safe for everyone again, I wasn’t there. I was too young but there we were told he didn’t even have to use words. They understood just a series of movements and eye contact. \n\n“Derek explained the rule with the lift. He told us it was a gesture of goodwill. The creatures needed a home and seemed attracted to the building and we would let them live there and stop killing their kind if they would stop killing ours. But to show them some respect we would allow them a small time frame where unleash their instinctual nature. But only if someone came to them.\n\n“There are only 2 left now. Prudence killed the other during what happened with her granddaughter. But that only made them 2 stronger. Like they absorbed the 3rd.” \n\nI tried to take in all the information I was receiving but I couldn’t. It was too much. \n\n“Derek isn’t coming back, it’s been years, this is pointless!” Terri finally erupted. Precious laughed again.\n\n“How do you know?! You speak to dear old Prue all the time, know something we don’t?” Precious spoke sarcastically but I think she meant what she said. It was becoming clear that Prudence Hemmings wasn’t too popular in this building. \n\n“I don’t speak to her all the time! We just keep in contact, she was always nice to me!” Terri tried weakly to defend herself.\n\n“That’s because you’re naive and a pushover! She used you because no one else would give her the time of day!” Precious was about to launch into a full rant on Terri. I was glad Eddie and Ellie were in the other room and couldn’t hear. I wondered if she’d seen them at night. \n\nI decided to stop the rant. This was becoming counter productive and we were getting nowhere with our plans. I interjected and told them all I needed them to leave so that I could sleep. Partly true, although I knew I couldn’t sleep. I had other things to do. \n\nThey all filed out of my flat, Terri and the kids were the last to leave. She gave me a hug as she left and told me to get a proper nights rest, telling me she was always there for a cuppa and a chat. It was sweet. I felt sorry for Terri. The kids hugged me too as they left. \n\nI know she spoke to Prue, but I was certain that it really was entirely innocent. \n\nI sat in the empty flat disheartened that my assembling of an army had turned into a bickering shit show with no real suggestions on how to kill the imposter neighbours. \n\nI felt totally alone. I couldn’t trust Prue or Ian or pretty much anything I thought I knew. Maybe Prue didn’t even kill those neighbours. They only told me half truths about the creatures after all. \n\nI was left alone with my thoughts again. And after a few hours, a good one finally struck me, but I needed supplies.\n\nI left the building and went to the nearest shop to gather the items I needed. For what I needed and the time of night I had to travel to a 24 hour supermarket. It took half hour each way on the bus. But I stayed focused. My bags were heavy and awkward on the way back to the block but if it paid off this was going to be worth it. \n\nI trudged up the stairs. It took me 2 trips and 24 flights of stairs instead of 14 to get everything in my flat and organise myself. \n\nIt only took 16 and a large gym bag that was much easier to carry on the way back down, thankfully. \n\nI passed the man on floor 5 twice. Now I’d noticed him, he made my skin crawl a little. \n\nI walked through the downstairs corridor, diverting away from the main entrance and passing all the ground floor flats to the door at the back of the building.\n\nThe door at the back lead to a small concrete area with a grass strip along the side and a bench decorated with a memorial plaque. This was the blocks outside space. As is typical in the city the whole bench was covered in graffiti. The memorial was unreadable. \n\nI got to work. I dug the strip of grass, turning soil with my new equipment. I had never been green fingered and to be honest the shrubs I had bought had been so heavy I had grown to resent them a little. I worked for an hour and a half. I was sweating and night had come, it was pitch black and I was using my phone torch to see. \n\nI had almost given up until I got up from my crouching position to stretch my knees. I reached my arms out, put down my shovel and took a seat on the bench. \n\nI hadn’t seen him arrive but the man was already sat there. He wore a flat cap and a jacket, despite it being the middle of summer and a beautiful night. He just smiled warmly at the shrubs for a moment without a word. Eventually he spoke. \n\n“I’ve missed this place. Names Derek.”\n\nOur journey: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/clvga9\/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app"},"262":{"title":"I was in prison for 15 years. There was a skinwalker in there with us.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/e1eyok\/i_was_in_prison_for_15_years_there_was_a\/","flair":null,"author":"None","selftext":"A little background first. I was serving a 15-year sentence in a penitentiary in southern Arizona. What I was in there for isn't important. During my stay there, there were countless things that happened that no one could explain, and even more that no one wanted to know more about. \n\nIt all started with a prison legend. Supposedly, years ago something awful and unexplainable happened in the prison. Every morning we'd be woken up, and expected to stand near the front of our cells while guards visually confirmed we were present and accounted for. Apparently about a year before I got sent there, the most brutal and unexplainable thing happened during one of these routines. A man who had a cell to himself looked very off during this check. When a guard pulled over another guard to help him check it out, they found it wasn't actually the prisoner they were expecting at  all. It was a totally different man. This man, was wearing the skin of the other man over him. Loosely fitting, draped over him, apparently looked like a real monster. The scariest things were though, was the guy wearing the skin was NOT an inmate. They had no idea how he even got into prison, let alone a cell. Whats worse is that they couldn't even figure out who the hell he was. He wasn't documented anywhere. And whats worse than that? They never even found the body of the man of the skin he was wearing.\n\nPretty grisely stuff, I know. And I realize that's not the go-to definition of a skinwalker, but that's what the prison called him. The Skinwalker. Didn't help that the guy never talked apparently. Anyway, thats what started the whole skinwalker superstition around the yard. Apparently the guy got shipped to a different spot about a month after it happened, and just about everyone in genpop felt all the better for it. I heard about the story on the second day of my stay. Hell of a story to hear to place in your home for the forseeable future.\n\nNow onto the real shit though. Sure, that guy was The Skinwalker, but all he did in the long run was get an old lifer Navajo inmate to tell everyone about actual skinwalkers. It seemed like a lot of the prison culture actually revolved around them. \n\nNow, apparently, skinwalkers are tricky to point out on the spot, but if you manage to survive around one for more than a minute or two, almost everyone can tell the mannerisms are all off. They can mimic human speech but not replicate it. They twitch manically. They have an unnatural gait while walking. But apparently they got better with experience. The old Navajo guy - his name was Carl - said that he was sure there was an actual one among the prisoners. Slowly picking us off over the years. He called it \"The Grandmaster Skinwalker\" at one point. Apparently he thought it had human mannerisms down so well that you might not even be able to tell if it was your cellmate for a day or two. It had to be good he posited one night. He would expect a skinwalker to jump at any opprtunity for a kill. But this one realized it had a revolving door of people to kill coming to it, and masterfully bided its time, as Carl thought, for years.\n\nA lot of guys found humor in it. A lot more were really on edge about it. Every once in a while in prison, people snap. Sometimes you'll find your cellmate swinging in front of your bunk, strung up around the neck by his pant leg. Sometimes you just can't take it anymore. But in our yard, people tended to snap in a very special way. It wouldn't be an outburst at dinner, or a silent suicide in the night. Guys would just stop talking. Hunch over and shuffle around. Any friendships they had would be mostly out the window. They would turn into a loner during rec time, they would let their hair hang in front if their face. \n\nNo one liked to talk about it. Like if they did, it would happen to them next. I felt the same way. I didn't know if it was a skinwalker, or just people going crazy. But I didn't want to find out. It wasn't clockwork or anything, but every time someone snapped in this way, it wasn't more than a couple weeks before they were \"shipped off\" or \"transferred\" to God knows where without anyone else knowing beforehand.\n\nThen there was the nighttime occurances. Short, loud bursts of sound echoed through my cell block during all hours of the night on a regular basis. It sounded like a mix between a pigs dying squeels and nails on a chalkboard. Just another thing no one liked to talk about. Even scarier were the shadows and footsteps. The block was dimly illumanted in the night by a few lights hanging from the ceiling outside the cells. I myself saw shadows flit across my walls on a regular occasion, when there were definitely no guards near my cell. One time near the end of my sentence, I woke up, looked at my back wall and found a perfect silohuette of a person standing there, but when I looked, my bunkmate was asleep, and no one was outside my cell.\n\nAnd the footsteps. Everyone hated the fuckin footsteps. They were the scariest part. In the night, sometimes, more rarely than the shadows, you would hear ungodly fast footsteps. They sounded like wet feet slapping on tile floor. Whatver caused them would fly from one end of the block to the other in a dead sprint. Whatever it was, it was inhumanely fast. If you happened to be awake before it started, by the time you heard the footsteps on one side of your cell and whipped your head around to see the thing run by, it sounded like it was 3 cells past you. Everyone hated the footsteps. I agreed, I thought they were the worst.\n\nI was released from that place about a month ago, and I have more stories than I can count. I swear it was nearly my turn. About a week before I was discharged, my cellmate, and a good friend of mine \"snapped\". In the same kinda way. I didn't sleep for an entire week. Well I did sleep of course but never for more than a few minutes at a time. Never turned my back on the guy. The scariest thing? I woke up one night to him somehow snaking his body through the bars of our cell. For reference, I couldn't get anything past my shoulder through them. The worst part though, he was coming back in to our cell. \n\nOn the day of my release I didn't say a word to him. Just left. He seemed fine with it, so, so was I. I had made it through, 15 years of prison fights, gang disputes and for all I know, skinwalker abductions. I left through the front gates, a free man. As I walked along the fence for the rec yard, I spotted my cellmate, standing off on his own, like he had for the last week or so. I shook my head, not even really sure if it was him anymore. I took one last look over the yard, this time from the other side of the fence. I wish I hadn't.\n\nThere, standing off on his own, on the other side of the yard, was Carl. Slouched over, eyeing the other inmates, and twitching manically."},"263":{"title":"My son asked me to check the closet for monsters.

It was a little after midnight, I think. I went to check on him to see what was wrong and sat by his bedside.\n\n\nHe was wide awake and asked me to check the closet for monsters, which wasn’t surprising given the circumstances.\n\n\nHe’s still just a little kid, and without even taking into account all the crap he’s been put through thanks to my shitty marriage, moving into an unfamiliar, barely furnished home must be a lot to take in for someone his age.\n\n\nAnd you know how they say that your brain always stays half-awake when you’re sleeping in a new environment, right?\n\n\nThat’s all pretty much what went through my mind in a flash as soon as my son spoke.\n\n\nIt was no big deal. It was all normal, I thought.\n\n\nBut something else almost immediately clicked inside my brain, before I even got to look at where my son had pointed to while he made his innocent request.\n\n\nSomething was wrong.\n\n\nI turned my head and looked, and it took everything I had in me to not give in to fear and terror, all for the sake of my son.\n\n\nWhen you become a parent you have to protect your children no matter what, always putting yourself in harm’s way if necessary and spare them any and all kinds of things that might hurt them.\n\n\nThat’s why I didn’t freak out. I couldn’t, not when we had barely just started our new life. I had to protect him, and at that point in time as I sat on his bed I only knew one thing:\n\n\nWe had to leave the room.\n\n\nWe had to leave the house *immediately*.\n\n\n“Alright champ, of course” I said, faking bravery.\n\n\nThen I made a request of my own as I lowered my voice and got closer to him:\n\n\n“Hey, how about you step outside for a minute? If there’s a monster in there, I’ll have to kick its *BUTT* all over your room!”\n\n\nHe chuckled and said “*okay*”.\n\n\nI made sure to put some extra emphasis on the word “*butt*” because it’s something that always cracks him up when I say it. Fortunately he got stuck on that and not the fact that I was indirectly admitting to the possibility of there actually being a monster.\n\n\nAs soon as he left the room my mind raced as it started to put together the best and most efficient route to take him out of the house while picking my car keys and phone on our way out.\n\n\nWhen I heard the closet doors slowly creaking open behind me I knew it was time to go.\n\n\nI jumped out of the bed, exited the room and grabbed my son. We were out of the door and inside the car and moving in under a minute.\n\n\nI told him I couldn’t sleep so we were going out for some ice-cream to celebrate. He was a little taken aback and asked “*celebrate what*”, to which I replied “*just us two together, I love you buddy.*”\n\n\nIt was by no means a lie, but I just had to make sure that he was alright and wouldn’t think of anything else as we literally fled our new home.\n\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the house was a new environment for the two of us. I’d been there a couple of times before, cleaned it all up by myself and assembled what little furniture we had, so I knew for a fact what belonged where and what didn’t.\n\n\nAnd I know his room didn’t have a closet."},"264":{"title":"I saw something on the evening news that I can't explain","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/9418eh\/i_saw_something_on_the_evening_news_that_i_cant\/","flair":null,"author":"OQS","selftext":"My work friends and I were out at our favourite pub last night. Not a really fancy place but, you know, cheap beer and close enough to home that I don't have to drive. The night started out normally enough, the four of us crammed into a small table off in the corner, mostly talking shop and shitting on our boss. Being this was the middle of the week there weren't too many other people around, maybe around eight or nine others in the whole place. Everybody just kinda keeping to themselves, sorta people you'd expect to see in a pub on a Wednesday.\n\nAnyway, from where I'm sitting I have a pretty good view of the TV behind the bar. Jessie the bartender is kinda lazily flipping through channels and passes by our local news channel. There's a brief burst of orange and red on the screen which I register as a fire happening somewhere, which then disappears as Jessie switches over to the next channel. Something about the image looks oddly familiar though.\n\n\"Hey Jess, can you switch that back?\" I call out to her.\n\nThe news comes back on, and suddenly I recognize the building in the frame. It's *my* building, and it's burning.\n\n\"Holy shit,\" I say, loudly enough that a few people follow my gaze to the television. \"That's my apartment!\"\n\nThe crowd in the bar falls kinda quiet, everybody staring up at the screen now. The screen shows a wide shot of the outside of my building. The camera must be set up on the north end of the block because I recognize a lot of shops on the ground floor - property management, dry cleaner, convenience mart, etc. The top left corner of the building is aflame. It's not a huge fire by any means, but it looks like a few units between the top four floors or so have already been engulfed by the flames. \n\n\"Jesus, man,\" one of my coworkers says. \"That, uh...that sucks.\" There's an uncomfortable murmur of agreement that passes around the table. I mean, I don't blame them, I wouldn't know what to say in this situation either. \"Yup,\" I agree, just as awkwardly. Thankfully, my apartment is only about half way up and located on the west side of the building. I  cross my fingers, hoping my stuff will be okay.\n\nThe camera cuts to a reporter on the scene. He's standing a little further away; looking at the shops in the background I can tell he's across the street on the north-west corner of the building. \"Fire fighters are expected on the scene any moment,\" he's saying, \"and hopefully they'll be able to contain this horrible inferno before it spreads any further. As I was saying before, it's very fortunate that everyone was able to evacuate the building before things got too bad, or who knows what tragic events may have unfolded.\"\n\n\"He's really laying it on thick,\" my other coworkers jokes. I chuckle a bit. All things considered, at the moment it really didn't seem all that bad.\n\nBut then, a few moments later: \"Uh...hang on,\" the reporter on TV says, \"We're getting some updated information. It seems...hang on one moment, while we readjust the camera.\" The previously locked down camera starts to shift, the angle focusing on an area of the building about half way up the west side. All the lights in the building are out except for one. I feel a weird creeping sensation as I start counting the windows from the bottom.\n\nFive up, two over. That's my place. *I swore I turned that light out,* I think at first. Then I see it.\n\nThere's a...person, standing in my window. The camera is zoomed out too far to make out any features, but it definitely looks like a man and it's definitely standing in my apartment. I watch petrified as the camera zooms in closer, the reporter babbling on about \"the overlooked, ill fated soul still trapped in the blazing such and such.\" As the image gets closer, I start to make out more details.\n\nThe person is...dancing. Or something. I don't really know how to describe it, but he's moving around a lot, and everything he's doing has this bizarre rhythmic quality to it. He starts waving his arms in the air, back and forth, back and forth, and then he's waving them up and down at his sides. Then he's banging both fists on the glass. Then he's waving his arms over his head again, back and forth. Everything he's doing is to the exact same tempo. 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4. He starts jumping up and down, waving his arms over his head like he's trying to get someone's attention from a long distance, but everything is to the exact same rhythm. Over and over again. 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n\"What in the fuck,\" I say, my voice a hoarse whisper. And then the camera gets a little closer, and finally we can make out the person's features. \n\nIt looks almost exactly like me. It's wearing the exact same clothes that I'm wearing now, clothes I changed into moments before leaving the apartment earlier. Its face looks almost exactly like mine as well, except for its eyes. Its eyes are far too big for a normal person. It also has this almost comical look of horror on its face...I don't even know how to describe it. Imagine if someone were pretending to look scared, but as a joke. It would have almost seemed funny if the circumstances were different, but instead it was just extremely unnerving.\n\nNo one in the bar is talking now. Everyone is fixed on the TV. The \"person\" is still swaying and waving around, beating its hands on the glass or jumping in circles. I almost don't hear the reporter mention the fact that firefighters have rushed into the building and are now heading for my floor. *Oh god,* I think, without really understanding what was happening. *Please don't go in there.*\n\nI stare transfixed at the screen. From this angle you can just barely see the top of my front door through the window, not too far behind where this creature is flailing around. Right now it is holding it's face in his hands and shaking it's head from side to side as if saying no. Suddenly the door behind it bursts open as, presumably, the firefighters have entered my apartment. \n\nThe creature stops moving. For a second, I see its expression change. The comical look of horror is gone, replaced by a huge smile filled with enormous, pointed teeth. Then the lights go out.\n\nWe all just sat there, staring at the screen as the camera slowly zoomed out from the now dark window. No one says anything as we all quietly pay our bill and leave. I went directly to my sister's place across town and asked to stay with her. I told her there was a fire at my apartment and that's it. When I tried to find footage from the news online later that night, it seemed like they had edited that last part out.\n\nI don't know if any of you on this subreddit know what that thing was, but I hope they didn't put out that fire. I hope they let the whole fucking place burn to the ground."},"265":{"title":"Mr. Lakavote","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/82183q\/mr_lakavote\/","flair":null,"author":"nocturnalnanny","selftext":"I’m not sure if this will help anyone, but if my story saves even one person from the nightmares I now endure, I will consider it a win. I have borrowed a phone that was smuggled in here, and the orderly, that now monitors every move I make will be coming shortly, so I must be brief. \n\nA few days ago, I was laying in bed scrolling through Reddit, like I always do to make myself sleepy, when I came across this story that sent shivers up my spine. \n\nAfter I was done reading, I thought to myself, “wow, that was terrifying,” and then scrolled to the next one. Big mistake. \n\nTwenty minutes later, I heard a scratching noise coming from my bedroom door and I froze. Confused, as I live alone, I turned on the lamp next to me and looked towards my bedroom door. \n \n*silence.*\n\nAfter a moment, I decided it was my mind playing tricks on me. After all, I was reading scary stories in the dark. Probably not the best thing to do before bed, but hey, who doesn’t love a good spine-chilling story before they close their eyes. \n\nI went back to scrolling through r\/nosleep when again, I heard a long scratch on the door. I slowly got out of bed and tip-toed over to the noise. Grabbing the door handle, I gently opened it and peeked into my living room, only to find it vacant.\n\nI quietly closed the door and turned to walk back towards my bed, when my closet door flew open! Now, I don’t know about you guys, but when it comes to fight or flight reaction, I seem to choose the option that leaves you frozen in place with your eyes closed. A defense mechanism instilled in me from childhood and stories of the boogeyman. \n\nAfter a moment, I decided to open my eyes and cautiously look towards my closet. I physically heard the clock that was placed on my night stand stop ticking, and that’s when I met him. \n\nHe was almost 8 feet tall, standing on long spiny looking legs, with impossibly long arms that seemed to stretch on forever. What I could see of his body looked to be covered in deep dark cracks. He was wearing a long hooded cloak that touched the floor, as black as midnight on a moonless night, that slightly revealed his ruby red eyes. \n\nWh- who are you? I said with a shaky voice.\n\nHe never physically moved his mouth, but I heard him speak into my soul with the most sinister voice, “I am Mr. Lakavote and I am here to right your wrong.”\n\nPetrified, frozen in place, I tried to ask him what wrong I had done, but before I could finish he was right in front of me. His breath smelled of rotting flesh and death itself as he breathed down my face. \n\nHe reached out and ran his long boney fingers across my cheek, and instantly I knew what he could do. I felt my eyes being ripped from my head and the burning sensation that followed. I began to scream, but no sound came out. I was stuck in my own personal hell as darkness surrounded me. Alone and afraid. I wanted to die. I wanted the agony to end.\n\nAgain, I heard his voice as if it were my own thoughts, “I am the keeper of votesss, you know what you did. You will right your wrong or I will take your eyesssss, along with your eternal soul. You have 24 hoursss.” \n\nJust as fast as he had appeared, Mr. Lakavote had vanished. \n\nI did not sleep the rest of the night. I had visions of the horror, I had just endured that left me sweating and cold at the same time. Had I dreamt the whole thing? Could my mind even make up something so sinister and evil? And the pain, oh Lord the pain I felt, I have never experienced anything close to that kind of suffering in my entire life.   \n\nThe next morning, pacing my apartment, I tried my hardest to think of what I had done wrong. Did I forget to vote in our recent election? Had I missed an employee poll at work? What the hell had I not voted on that was so important that my soul depended on it? \n\nTrying to clear my head, I decided to open Reddit, as it always seemed to make me feel better and relaxed. While I was scrolling, I passed the story I had read the night before. The one that had made the hair on the back of my neck stand. \n\nThat’s when it clicked. I had scrolled to the next one before I gave that story the upvote it deserved. Instantaneously, I clicked on the up arrow and waited, hoping with every part of my being that, that was the answer. Was I playing a guessing game with my life? \n\nI waited the whole day, I didn’t eat, I didn’t move, I barely even breathed. I thought about writing to my family and sorting my goodbyes out but, I felt too incredibly empty to conjure up the words. No one would believe me anyways. \n\nAs the sun slowly set, I decided I might as well wait in my room and hope that I had redeemed myself, or possibly chance losing my eyes and my soul. The thought of that alone made me vomit into the trash can next to my bed and tremble violently with deep, petrifying terror. \n\nWhen my 24 hour mark finally came, I closed my eyes, held my breath, and waited. Prayed. Begged, that my soul would be saved and all would be forgiven. \n\n*silence*\n\nThen, I heard the breathing, I smelled the rotting flesh, I felt all the hair on my body raise. When I finally opened my eyes, I felt a chill that froze me to the bone, as if I was sitting inside a freezer meant for the dead. There he was, right in front of me. His eyes had turned to sapphires as he stared into my soul. \n\n“Don’t let it happen again”, he bellowed in a voice that to this day still haunts my dreams. Then he was gone. \n\nI know some of you won’t believe me. Hell, I’m not even sure if I believe myself. As the doctor here says, “it’s all in my head”. But, for the love of your eyeballs and your soul... do ***NOT*** forget to vote while you are reading stories on Reddit, or you too will have the “pleasure” of meeting Mr. Lakavote for yourself. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"266":{"title":"The previous tenant of my new flat left a survival guide.

I felt no pain at all from the burn on my face, everything was numb. The relief of eradicating the imposter neighbours and the joy at finding a friend in Derek was hacked away in an instant. Just like every leaf from my shrubs. Why would she do this? What had I ever done to her? \n\nEvery question possible crossed my mind. I could feel the frustration bubbling inside me, everything about this place just threw up question after question and for every answer I got, there were ten new questions waiting to be asked. At that moment in time though, only one was truly important. \n\nHow did Prudence know? \n\nI thought about Terri and her telephone conversations. I didn’t want to think that the sweet lady I thought Terri had turned out to be would do that, but it did cross my mind. I thought of Ian the postman, I’d had bad vibes from him for a while, maybe he’d seen Derek coming up the stairs while on his rounds that morning.\n\nI stood there frozen pondering all these things until I saw Prudence collapse onto the memorial bench sobbing, head in her hands. She was surrounded by the remains of my attempt at a garden with the shears laid out on the floor. \n\nThe stairs were kind to me on the way down, it took 4 flights to make it to the bottom. I ran down the corridor and out the back entrance of the block, no idea what I was going to say. \n\n“Prudence!” Was all I could manage. Nice one, Kat.\n\nShe sat bolt upright before turning and standing quicker than I thought it possible for an old lady. \n\n“You evil, stupid little girl! Do you have any idea what you’ve done?!” She screamed, so much animation in her face that the spaces between her wrinkles pulsated like veins on an angry weightlifter. \n\n“Me?! You think I’m evil! You left that shitty note hidden, missing everything I need to know and got my boyfriend killed! And what you’re doing to your own -“ I screamed, tears beginning to roll, before she interrupted me. \n\n“Don’t you dare talk about her!” Her voice cracked and she broke down again, this time falling to her knees, twigs and leaves sticking to the bottom of her dress. \n\nI didn’t know what else to do. So I sat down on the floor. I knew that it was probably a bad idea, this woman couldn’t be trusted and I hadn’t forgotten that, but seeing an old lady crying on the cement floor still made me feel awful.\n\n“How did you know about the garden?” I asked her calmly, trying to change my approach. \n\nShe shoved a crumpled up piece of paper into my hand, she didn’t look at me, her eyes remained on the floor. \n\n*Dear Prudence,*\n\n*I couldn’t exist knowing what I’d done.*\n\n*I should never have told you about it.*\n\n*The last two won’t grow stronger, she was never theirs to begin with. But I have to end her suffering.*\n\n*I’m sorry.*\n\n*Derek*\n\nI knew what he had done as soon as I finished the note. Lyla, or what was left of her, was gone for good. Of all the creatures only Jamie’s killers from the lift remained. That’s how Derek had spent the few hours I’d slept between our encounters. \n\n“This is all your fault.” She sniffed. “My whole family are gone because of you.”\n\nThat hurt a lot. I trembled as I tried to speak but I always really hated confrontation and I could feel myself starting to glitch. \n\n“H..how can you say that! I saw... her and she was trapped in a tiny cage eating dog food and small animals. Your family died in that lift. Just like my Jamie.” I may have struggled to get my words out, but I wasn’t about to let Prudence Hemmings blame me for her decisions. Lyla was better off dead than what she was, however awful that may sound. \n\n“What happened to your face?” Prudence growled at me. “Take you to visit floor number 9? He did this to her in the first place, not me! And now he’s disfigured you!” She was spinning things. I could feel throbbing as she mentioned my face, I really should have had medical attention. \n\n“This isn’t his fault! You messed him up and he did that to her because of you! You told me that yourself.” I tried ferociously to defend Derek but something inside me still felt uncomfortable about what he had done. I couldn’t help it, Lyla was an innocent little girl who shouldn’t have been punished for Prue’s mistakes. This whole thing was such a mess.\n\n“I was grieving! And then I had her back for all those years, and then I lost Bernie, and then my home and now I have to grieve for her all over again.” Prudence continued to cry, but softer. I looked around at the chaos she created and up at the block my boyfriend had died in and rolled my eyes in disbelief that she could be so selfish. She continued.\n\n“Let me tell you about Lyla. She was a beautiful little girl. As I mentioned before, I have two other older children, they’ve had many other grandchildren, however I hadn’t spoken to my eldest two in years even before what happened with Lyla. \n\n“Lyla was my first opportunity to get to know one of my grandchildren. Bernie adored her too, always reading her stories and sneaking her sweets. \n\n“I begged my son to allow her to stay. My children were all incredibly ungrateful, they had it easy growing up and still resented me. I gave them a good, strict upbringing but they didn’t appreciate it. They said I was a cruel mother. Lyla’s dad was the only one I spoke to, but our relationship still wasn’t that of a typical loving mother and son. But she was a second chance. \n\n“It was a miracle when he agreed. I was more shocked he had convinced his wife to allow it. That awful harlot of a woman never liked me, although I didn’t like her either. \n\n“They refused to speak to me after everything, I haven’t heard from them since. They had more grandchildren I’ll never meet. I knew at the time my relationships with any of my children were over for good. So when Derek gave me a solution I took it.\n\n“I wasn’t entirely truthful when we first spoke. I said I hadn’t wanted this, but I was desperate. There was never a way to bring her back safely. Derek explained what she would become to me. He was initially trying to put me off even trying to get her back. I knew exactly what I was getting myself into. \n\nBut I couldn’t pass up the idea of my beautiful little Lyla, needing her grandma forever. I suppose I was too ashamed to admit it before. But why should I be ashamed?\n\n“My altercation with Derek happened after she was back, when he tried to kill her the first time. Spouting the same things on that note, what kind of monster wants to kill a little girl? That’s why I trashed the garden. He said he wasn’t coping with the news of the new block when he suggested it, that he shouldn’t have told me it was even possible and she had to die. I hid her until the bulldozers came in. \n\n“When he disappeared I thought I was safe to spend the rest of my life with her. \n\n“Bernie hated me. Spending time with Lyla was all I lived for, I grew to love her how she was.”\n\nI felt sick. Listening to Prudence talk bought up so many repressed feelings about Jamie. I hadn’t had time to grieve or process anything, I missed him terribly. My old life and my old future felt a million miles away.\n\nI was relieved to know that Derek hadn’t tricked Prudence, or even intended to create rat-Lyla. He was truly good.\n\n“But she didn’t get to have a life. You lived for her but she wasn’t really living. How could a sane person do that to their own flesh and blood?” I retorted.\n\n“You have no idea. This place can make you do irrational things! But she had a life! She had me. It’s all she needed.” She was certainly right about the building and irrational actions, the pain intensifying on my face throbbed in agreement. But I was still convinced she had lost it Dr Frankenstein style where rat-Lyla was concerned. \n\nShe had stopped crying. Her rage levels were rising again. I tried to tell her that it wasn’t really the child she’d known, but she seemed to have grown an entirely new attachment to the creature that replaced what she lost. \n\nEvery rational argument I gave was met with increasing levels of screaming. She got less coherent as she went on. The argument was going nowhere, we went back and forth for what felt like forever.\n\nAfter a while she started to get closer to me. We had both stood up by this point and despite her haggard and frail appearance, Prudence was truly frightening. She looked unhinged. \n\nHer words were no longer going in, I was overwhelmed and had too many thoughts rushing through my mind to process her ranting. I took a few steps back clearing a small distance between us. \n\nBy this point, out of the corner of my eye, I could see neighbours in windows of the block, watching the altercation outside, Prue’s screaming had bought a lot of attention. It was bright and I couldn’t see well but I turned to scan the windows and did recognise Eddie and Ellie watching from their bedroom, trying to wave at me. \n\nThey frantically waved and pointed, I tried waving back and gesturing to them, but they kept pointing at me.... why were they pointing?\n\nThen I heard it, the garden shears scraping against the ground as Prudence picked them up and charged towards me. “You ignorant little bitch! You aren’t even listening. You’re don’t deserve my home! You killed her!”\n\nThe twins had been telling me to turn around, I shouldn’t have taken my eyes off her. \n\nLuckily, unlike my earlier shock when I had first seen her, I didn’t freeze. My fight or flight instincts kicked in and I ran faster than I ever have before. I burst back into the building and heard neighbours on the bottom floor lock their doors in a symphony of bolts clicking. \n\nI couldn’t blame them. Prudence wasn’t far behind me and I wouldn’t want to take her on in her current state if given a choice. But it didn’t stop me pounding on their doors begging someone to call the police, although something told me that in this building that wasn’t going to happen. I ran up the stairs, still being followed by her. \n\nBy the second floor most were still locked but a few had come out of their homes, armed with a variety of heavy objects. Even in a crisis, I couldn’t fault the community spirit here. I ran another flight of stairs that became two but still lead me to floor 3 and then to the back of the corridor. I pounded on Terri’s door.\n\nMy heart was racing but when I turned Prue was nowhere to be seen. I was hoping the people who came out on floor 2 had stopped her but something was odd. I hadn’t heard any commotion. This wasn’t the end of it.\n\nEddie and Ellie hugged me tight as Terri let me in and bolted the door shut quickly behind me. I told her about what had happened. She couldn’t believe what Prue had done. It turned out no one knew about Lyla. \n\nI was edgy for the first hour. But Prue had disappeared. Terri helped to clean up my burn and put some cold compress on it. She offered to take me to the hospital, but I couldn’t. \n\nI was too shaken up from what had just happened, I couldn’t face trying to explain how I’d sustained my injuries and I still hadn’t reported Jamie missing. He still hadn’t had any messages from his family, and work had given up calling, but his friends had started. They were harassing me non stop but I had been too distracted to come up with a decent lie.\n\nIt had been a week since I moved in and it wouldn’t be long until people realised something was seriously wrong. My conversations with my family had been short, with me insisting they didn’t visit until we were “unpacked and set up”. \n\nOn top of a murderous old lady and an untold amount of abnormal issues the real world problems were starting to creep up on me. \n\nI sat with Terri for hours, drinking tea and chatting to her. It started to get dark and Eddie and Ellie came into the living room after playing in their room for a while. The voids replaced the big, brown puppy dog eyes again and their claws looked especially sharp, but to me they were still adorable. \n\nTheir transformation prompted me to head back to my flat, it was late. I needed to work out what to do next and how to dig myself out of this giant hole. I couldn’t just keep planting gardens. I needed to do this myself. \n\nI wandered up the stairs, they went on for a while, but nothing too horrific. I passed the man on floor 5, nodding politely and continuing my ascent. I wondered if he’d received the letter of concern yet, he was a little unsettling. \n\nWhen I got to my floor Mr Prentice was making his animal noises again. I smiled, which hurt my face. After all the madness I was starting to find the seemingly benign horrors of this building oddly comforting. \n\nI reached my flat and turned the key in the door before bolting myself in like Terri had. \n\nI could feel something wasn’t right the moment I entered. The flat was in chaos, which was nothing new because we had only moved in a week ago and I had been too preoccupied to unpack. But things were out of place, the organised chaos wasn’t how I’d left it. \n\nThen she strolled out of my kitchen. Prudence Hemmings. She was carrying a large carving knife in her left hand this time, she had prepared for her attack. She smiled at me and lifted her right hand, jingling a set of keys that she had entered with. \n\nI turned to unbolt the door but she grabbed me from behind before I could turn the handle to open it and held the knife to my throat. \n\n“I will kill you for what you’ve done.” She whispered into my ear. \n\nWithout a second thought I leaned forward just a tad and swung my head back as hard as I could. I couldn’t believe that it worked but I must have broken her nose. Prudence dropped the knife and clutched her face, blood streaming between her fingers. \n\nI went to grab the knife but she was closer and doing the same thing. I had no other option but to run again. I grabbed the door handle and turned it to exit the flat as she tried to stab me. I was mostly out the door, but her arm was close enough to reach my side, and I felt the knife pierce the side of my torso.\n\nI was in searing pain but I didn’t stop running. As I stepped outside my flat I could still hear Mr Prentice’s noises flooding the entire hallway. It gave me an idea. \n\nI ran towards his door, Prudence stabbing at me frantically with blood gushing from her nose. A few got me as I stopped outside flat 48, the pain was awful and I could feel myself starting to drift out of consciousness, I was losing a lot of blood. \n\nI would give my last breath to end Prue. So running on nothing but adrenaline I knocked hard on flat 48, and shouted.\n\n“Mr Prentice, can you help me?”\n\nIt was a shot in the dark, I didn’t know what would happen but I had to try something.\n\nShe had stopped stabbing at me, she was enjoying watching me bleed out slowly from the wounds she had already inflicted.\n\nI was incredibly weak, and I lost consciousness not long after that, but before I did I heard heavy clunking from the inside of flat 48, chain locks being released and bolts being undone. I watched with blurry vision as a large creature, that I can only describe as a cross between a bull and a wolf, charged out of the flat and trampled the old witch to death. I heard hear bones crunch just as slipped away. \n\nI woke up in the hospital a day later. My parents were there as were the police, apparently I had been found just outside the tower block with my handbag missing, by a neighbour who had been watching from a window as it happened. \n\nThe police told me that the person had seen the mugging out of their window. They had seen two men approach me and Jamie, splash something in my face, attack us, and when he tried to fight back, they bundled my boyfriend into a car, which the police had been searching for to no avail. He was officially missing. \n\nI was baffled, but grateful that Jamie’s disappearance wouldn’t be blamed on me. I went along with it and made out that he had ghosted work to enjoy our first week living together. \n\nI had been stabbed 4 times but thankfully in all the right places, if there is such a thing as the right place to be stabbed. I lost a lot of blood but I was going to be fine. They were all shallow. They assumed my burns were chemical and happened during the mugging too. \n\nThe police promised to keep us updated but they still can’t find the car. They never will. I wish the story the police had been told were true, it left some hope for Jamie. \n\nMy parents weren’t keen on me returning to the flat after what happened, they said the area was too rough, and that I was living proof it wasn’t safe. They offered to collect my stuff for me. I insisted though, told them that I wanted to see how I felt and they couldn’t force me not to.\n\nI was released from the hospital two days after I woke up in there. When I arrived at the flats, it was strange. It felt like home. Despite everything, something about this place drew me to it. \n\nI took the lift for the first time since Jamie had died. I had to, I wasn’t recovered enough to conquer too many stairs just yet, and I couldn’t guarantee they’d be kind to me. I smiled at the lack of a button 9 and winced at the thought of the creatures. \n\nAs I reached my corridor I saw Mr Prentice walking along with his newspaper and milk in a bag. He turned to me and smiled.\n\n“I wasn’t sure you’d come back. It’s nice to see you’re up and walking.” He made small talk as if I hadn’t seen him literally trample a woman to death a couple of days prior. The whole experience had been so disorienting that I started to wonder if I really had been mugged and had dreamed the note and everything that’s happened since. Then he said something that confirmed everything was real. \n\n“I never liked that woman. But you’ve got a real friend in the lady downstairs.” He winked at me and turned the key in his door. \n\nI got into mine and sat down on the second hand sofa. I felt empty but relieved. With Prue and the imposter Qneighbours all gone the only threat left were the creatures in the lift, who were only a threat between 1.11 and 3.33.\n\nMaybe I could start to live a semi peaceful life in this place. \n\nTerri knocked on the door, my handbag, that I had left at hers before Prue attacked in my flat, on her arm. Mr Prentice was right, she was a good friend. \n\nI thanked her for what she’d done and for what she’d told the police. She said it was pure luck that she found me, she had been walking up to return the bag and found me and Prue sprawled out on the floor. I asked what happened to Prue’s body and she just pointed in the direction of flat 48. \n\n“He was eating it.” She said.\n\nIt’s been a few days now and I’ve decided to stay. I can’t imagine going back to complete normality after everything I’ve been through and I’ve grown quite attached to some of the buildings quirks. \n\nI tried replanting the garden with the help of the twins. I ripped a few stitches doing it and Derek never came. I think he’s gone for good.\n\nI’m ready to fully embrace life here. The last few days have been hard but there’s some time to breathe. Along with the time to breathe, came the time to grieve and I’ve been grieving badly for Jamie.  \n\nThis leads me to the last thing I have to tell you. \n\nLast night I laid in bed, plagued with thoughts of Prue and everything that had happened, but what I couldn’t get to leave my mind was how much happiness it bought her to have Lyla back. It infected every part of my thoughts. I know you all warned me not to, but I did it. I repeated the ritual. \n\nI haven’t caught him yet, but I’ve heard the scratching.

Low, monotonic, unwavering. \n\nIn front of me was my mother, crucified haphazardly upon a ramshackle wooden cross. Rivets were driven through each palm - with rope fastenings in place around her ankles and shoulders to keep her in position. \n\nHer eyes, red and cracked from exposure, pulled open by tape, to reveal pupils dilated with fear. \n\nHer mouth was sewn shut. Muffling her tired pleas.\n\n“This is hardly an existence,” the voice licked.\n\nI surveyed my surroundings. I was in a small, square room, with metal walls no larger than my studio apartment. The roof, however, was missing, replaced by an empty void that seemed to stretch endlessly into the darkness above.\n\nAbout five feet in front of me was my mother. Writhing weakly against her restraints. Five feet behind her, an impossibly tall ladder stretching into the abyss. \n\n“What are you waiting for? As if you care,” the voice prompted.\n\nWho was talking? Where was this voice coming from? Its warm presence swaddled me like a warm blanket.\n\nIn one swift surge, the gravity of the situation dawned on me. I didn’t know where I was. I didn’t like being lost. \n\nI felt the kick of adrenaline into my bloodstream. My heart, beating against my ribcage. My hands, clammy. I clenched them repeatedly. Open, closed. Open, closed. \n\nI needed to get out of here. \n\n“End her.”\n\nMy gaze dashed to my right hand side to find a surgical stand stocked full of pain-inflicting paraphernalia. \n\nA knife. A rope. A pistol. Razor blades, full needles, strange pills and powder. \n\nAn arsenal fit to maim, disfigure, destroy.\n\nI reached for the razor blade. I could cut the stitching on my mother’s mouth - garner some insight into what the fuck was going on. \n\nMy mother always knew what was going on. \n\nWith the razor blade in hand, I walked gingerly up to my mother - whose eyes lit up as I approached. \n\nAnd through all the pain, tears and stitches, as I drew closer, she smiled. \n\nI held up my left hand to coddle my mother’s face, with the razor blade still pinched in my right. \n\nAnd as she nuzzled her face into my palm, I cracked. I wept harder than I’d ever wept before. Full-bodied, wracking sobs crashed over me. \n\nBecause it didn’t matter how bad anything got. It didn’t matter how broken the situation, or how broken the person. \n\nMy mother was just happy I was there. \n\nI steadied myself and lifted up my right hand, trembling as I drew closer to her face - ready to pick away at the stitches to the best of my ability. \n\nThe first few snapped, then the next, until all the stitches had been split and I had liberated her mouth from its cage. \n\nI exhaled raggedly, leaning back to look deeply into my mother’s eyes. \n\n“M-Mum?”\n\nBut as tears fell down her cheeks, through her warm, loving smile, she uttered one word. \n\n“Climb.”\n\nI peered past her towards the ladder, then looked back towards her for reassurance. It took a slow, simple nod to realise that this was what I had to do. \n\nAnd as I walked slowly towards the ladder, she murmured one last thing. \n\n“I love you.”\n\n“I love you too, mum.”\n\nI never said that enough.\n\nThen, with razor blade still in hand, I climbed. I climbed with determination. I climbed for what seemed like hours. \n\nI climbed past broken rungs, and even when I was tired, I kept on climbing. \n\nI cried as I climbed, but I pushed through, with snot dribbling down my chin and tears clouding my vision. \n\nI reminisced as I climbed. I climbed through good memories, I climbed through bad memories. I climbed through the time when I had the flu and my mother came around to do my laundry, and I climbed through the time my girlfriend cheated on me. \n\nI climbed because I was sick of this dark room. I climbed to make my mother proud. \n\nAnd as I climbed, the darkness subsided, opening itself up to light. \n\nI could see the where the ladder ended now. I could see my way out. \n\nAs I placed my hand on the last rung of the ladder and pulled myself up over the edge, I was overcome by brightness. \n\nThe light subsided, and as I got my bearings, I found myself on my back in my bathtub, still clutching the razorblade. \n\nUrgent knocking on my bathroom door roused me from my daze.\n\n“Are you alright in there? Your sister called. We’re worried about you.”\n\nIt was my mother’s voice.\n\nI got up out of the bathtub, and placed the razorblade back on the shelf, walking towards the door. And as I flung it open, she looked at me. She looked at me and she knew. \n\nShe held me in her arms and we sobbed. \n\n“I wouldn’t know how to live without you,” she whimpered.\n\nMy climb had just begun."},"268":{"title":"The previous tenant of my new flat left a survival guide.

The way her skin melted off her face, the smell of her hair burning and the sound that she made. \n\nI didn’t have time to count but there were more than I originally thought. I figured these must have been the 15 people Prudence talked about, entering the flats that burned before it happened. I already knew that Natalia was one of them. \n\nEddie and Ellie clutched Terri’s skirt, trembling with fear. I wanted to help protect them, but I still couldn’t help but tremble a little myself every time I caught a glimpse of those hollow voids where their eyes were. \n\n“Hi Terri, the kids said we could borrow some sugar?” She asked menacingly, grinning at the frightened family stood next to me. After a moment or two of intense staring Natalia finally addressed me. She appeared to be the spokesperson for the group. “How’s your friend doing? It was a shame we had to end our visit. I was enjoying her company.”\n\n“Don’t speak about her! She’s got nothing to do with you, you sick bitch!” I screamed at her, I couldn’t bare looking at her face again. “You don’t scare me with all your freak friends. I’m not going to let you hurt this lady or her kids!”\n\nNatalia chuckled. I gulped. \n\nI may talk a good game but I am no hero. Mere days ago I was just a young girl excited to move in with her boyfriend and now here I am. My boyfriend’s dead, my flat is like living in my own personal horror movie and I’m standing up challenging demonic flame neighbours to defend demonic looking children. \n\nBut when I said she didn’t scare me, I meant it. Something inside me was eradicating any fear of these people, I just wanted to protect the residents. Life really does throw curveballs. \n\n“I know you aren’t scared. I saw it in your eyes when you stuck that big knife in my throat. That’s why we’re here.\n\n“My brothers and sisters are not freaks. You’re the freaks! Thinking that your lives have meaning. We watch you people go about your day to day lives and your mundane routines and nothing really changes. Your lives are pointless and disposable.\n\n“That’s why we set the fire, all those years ago.”  She chuckled throughout her words. There was an animation in them like she was a psychotic cartoon character, finally catching its prey after 138 episodes of chasing. \n\n“Those people weren’t disposable...” Terri mumbled, barely a decibel higher than a whisper.\n\n“What was that Terri? Did you have something to say.” Natalia went from psychotic cartoon to school bully. She made my skin crawl.\n\n“I was only a child, but those people were friends of my parents, they were good people.” Terri said with slightly more confidence. \n\nNone of the other people had moved. They just stood there staring. \n\n“Why would you burn people alive? What can you possibly gain?” I interjected, taking a slight step between Natalia and Terri and the kids. I could see she was getting ready to go for them and I couldn’t let it happen. \n\n“We were living with the great leader, Michael. All of us. Living in the righteous manner that he had directed us to live” She gestured to the people around her. The name Michael appeared to inspire some sort of emotion in the group. \n\n“Michaels brother Jonathan lived here, on the floor we burned. He let us hang out there sometimes, but he didn’t live the righteous way that we did. He didn’t like our beliefs, but he took us in when we lost the place we were staying because of the growth of the group. Him and Michael rarely saw eye to eye. They argued passionately. \n\n“Our group never believed in living within the constraints of societal norms and we were up at all hours, we came and went as we pleased, embracing freedoms and listened to music as we did introspective work.” \n\nTerri shoved the kids further behind her and snapped, infuriated. \n\n“You were a group of entitled, bratty hippies following some middle aged, mentally ill twat. Listen to yourself! The stereotypical cultish drivel coming out of your mouth right now!” Terri cried. I was shocked at her outburst. Although I couldn’t have agreed more. It did sound like cultish drivel. It made me so angry that this was what an entire floor of people died over. \n\nAs Terri ended her rant the curtains hanging on the window behind her burst into flames. I jumped and felt my heart skip a beat. \n\n“Don’t insult us. I’m sick of hearing simple minded people call us a cult.” Came from the back row. An average looking man with dark hair and jeans had piped up, smiling and watching the curtains burn. He had done that. They were all capable of what Natalia had done to Georgia at the very least.\n\nFor the first time since the people had entered Terri’s flat my nerves of steel had wavered. I realised that we were only alive because they were allowing it so far. We were in big trouble.\n\nTerri swiftly shut up and Natalia continued her story.\n\n“Michael was the true leader. Not like all the fakes you hear of in the news. The people you’re talking about. He was teaching us to build a world of peace and harmony. But he didn’t deny that in order to do that you had to eradicate the non believers. He taught us to embrace the bad in us. To harness it so that we could do extraordinary things.” She smiled wickedly as her hands glowed hot coals as she spoke. \n\nIt may have sounded like cultish drivel but Michael being a total faker wouldn’t explain their powers. \n\n“Things went wrong when someone went to the police after Michael and Jonathan had a terrible argument one night. When the police arrived Jonathan told us to go. \n\nThe group had been planning to leave this building anyway. We’d had nothing but interruption and trouble in our time here, this place is weird. But we had nowhere immediate to go. The police already disliked us after overcrowding the last property. We didn’t need any more attention. \n\n“Michael was furious. We brainstormed in a field for hours who could have done it. I personally suspected the next door neighbour, Mavis. The woman was so nosey, always knocking and asking us to keep noise down, interrupting our spiritual sessions. \n\n“Michael couldn’t make a certain judgement on the person who had done it. All we thought we were sure of was that they had to be on the same floor. So he instructed us to go back that night and eradicate the whole floor and every non believer who lived there. \n\n“As you know, we obliged.” This incited sick laughter from the crowd. I waited, forcing myself to let her finish. Buying time. \n\n“We took pleasure in their screams, in watching every man woman and child go up in flames through their front door windows. It was the first time we’d unleashed all that energy and we felt so powerful!\n\n“But then as we left the burning hallway behind us and entered the stairwell, this building found a way to fuck us over one more time. \n\n“I couldn’t give you a number on the amount of times we tried to run down those stairs, leave our glorious victory behind us and return to Michael. It didn’t matter how many times we tried. \n\n“We couldn’t make it past that floor, the stairs wouldn’t let us. It didn’t take long before the fire reached the stairwell we were trapped in, burning us all, along with the non believers. We died just in time for the fire engine to arrive. \n\n“We may have been dead but we didn’t disappear. We couldn’t leave the building, we were stuck just wandering it, in and out of the burned flats and hallways but not allowed anywhere else unless we were asked. It was awful. We didn’t try to cause any trouble at first. We waited for Micheal to come and find us, instruct us. \n\n“Two months passed and he hadn’t come. Instead came confirmation. A newspaper put through the door of the building. Headline news. \n\n“*Tower block resident Bernie Hemmings information vital to imprisonment of local cult leader on drug charges.*”\n\nI gasped. I couldn’t believe I hadn’t found that when I was researching Prue. But I suppose local news wasn’t so heavily online back then. Natalia saw my shocked expression and grinned wider than before.\n\n“The old bat didn’t tell you that then?” She asked, although it wasn’t really a question. “That her stupid husband is the whole reason we’re here!” \n\n“We started to really cause issues then. Did anything within our power to fuck the whole building over. But it didn’t take them long to work out that we had to be asked to come in. \n\n“We only stopped when Prue worked out a way we could die a second time, and that we wound come back again. She killed two of our group. She was the only person that could stop us. We couldn’t do shit with her around. We stopped and reached a stalemate. Then she moved out. We were going to honour that stalemate. Until you stabbed me. Prue’s gone. It’s fair game in here now.”\n\nAs Natalia got angrier a member of her group started getting agitated, they all soon followed like a hive mind, working as one, the stillness became chaotic, with all of them moving and making noise. \n\nI didn’t notice at first when one started walking towards Terri and the kids, but I noticed when it got near.\n\nIt was a teen girl, slender and pretty, but still unsettlingly average. As she got within a metre of the family Ellie suddenly went rigid. The claws that replaced her fingernails grew longer and sharper, with jagged edges from growing so fast. The voids deepened, if that was even possible. \n\nShe opened her mouth to reveal rows of sharp teeth, blood caked where the tooth meets the gum where they had grown too quickly as well. Ellie jumped. She reached out towards the girl and slashed her face with the claws, leaving deep gouges across her eyes.  She clung on to the girl using her claws as wall pegs keeping herself at eye level. \n\nEddie controlled the crowd. His own claws grew and he ran towards them, sending them scattering out of the flat, random bursts of flames erupted everywhere. Lighting up the whole room. \n\nShit had hit the fan. The two demon children were successfully fending off a group of 15 dead superhuman cultists. Natalia ran from them too, but kept her eyes locked on mine as she did. As she ran from the flat she spoke to me. \n\n“This isn’t over!” She screamed, and I knew that it wasn’t. \n\nI stayed on Terri’s sofa that night, we organised all the burned items in the house and threw things out before we crashed out in the early hours. The kids claws retracted and they returned to their earlier state. Causing mischief in the hallways. They were too young to really understand.\n\nI didn’t sleep much. Nothing new. \n\nWhen I woke up Terri was still asleep. I didn’t want to disturb her so I walked back to my flat, desperate to avoid anything strange on my way. The stairs must have noticed, because they didn’t skip on my way up. \n\nI hadn’t checked the time when I left Terri’s but I reached my door at the same time as a familiar face. Postman Ian was stood there, dropping letters on my doorstep. \n\n“Hey, love!” He shouted as he noticed me. \n\n“I need to talk, can you come inside, just five minutes? Please?” I practically begged him at the doorstep.\n\nI told him everything that had happened the night before. How Natalia was out for revenge and I was the object of her rage. I begged him to tell me how to kill them, but he claimed he didn’t know. He said if kept my doors locked and didn’t let them in then I’d be fine. \n\nHe looked shirty as I mentioned killing them. Didn’t even suggest asking Prudence how to do it. Something was telling me there wasn’t much point.  He seemed so disingenuous.\n\nI wanted to trust him. So badly I wanted to trust him. I had been so vulnerable with him over Jamie.\n\nBut if Prudence Hemmings could forget to mention what Bernie had done, and conveniently never pass on the method to kill these awful people, leaving them around to terrorise her friends and neighbours... then could she be a liar too. Could I really trust Ian? \n\nWhen he provided no answers and no real help something inside me told me that I needed to get him out of my flat. I needed to rethink. Start working things out on my own. I made excuses to Ian and sent him on his rounds. \n\nPrudence left me these rules, but she left so much out. How do I know I wasn’t always a pawn in some sick game. Her fantasy life as a puppet master, setting me up to fail. She’s kept her granddaughter in a cage for years. Maybe she enjoys suffering. \n\nI wasn’t going to give up easily though. Natalia wasn’t going to win. \n\nI decided then and there that I needed to attend the committee meeting today and start building an army against Natalia. I didn’t need Prue’s help or her methods. With enough manpower I could do it myself. \n\nThis was war.\n\nThe next steps : https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/ckw07c\/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app"},"269":{"title":"My job is watching a woman trapped in a room.

If Melanie was somehow a fake, that meant they must have sent her.  And if they sent her, that meant they knew.  They knew about the messages in her painting.  They knew about me asking questions.  And they knew I didn’t hit a button during any of it.\n\nI felt panic and fear crawling up my chest, making it hard to breathe.  Standing up, I started pacing, periodically glancing back at the monitor to see if Rachel could help me, tell me what I needed to do next.  But she had laid down on her bed.  It was hard to tell for sure with her back to the camera, but I think she was crying.\n\nNo, I needed to fix this.  Get her out of there.  And if I didn’t have a better plan, I’d just have to go with the one I already had.  \n\nFeeling the hard eye of the ceiling camera on me, I went to the door and stepped back into the locker room.  My phone was in my locker, and after messing up the combination the first time, I got the door open and got it out.  Gripping it tightly, I tried to hold it by my side casually, but I knew there was little point.  If they knew everything, I wasn’t going to be able to hide anything.  I just had to try and be fast, get some kind of message out to people that could help Rachel before they got to me.\n\nI opened the camera on the phone as I re-entered the surveillance room and hit record.  It made a small beeping noise and once I was sure it was recording, I turned the camera on myself.\n\n“My name…my name is Tommy.  Thomas Calhoun.  And my job is watching a woman trapped in a room.

For three years my job is to sit in this room…”  I moved the camera slowly around the room, taking in the door to the bathroom, the water cooler, the desk with the monitors, keyboard, and button box, “…and watch a video feed of a woman locked up in a bedroom somewhere.”  I stepped closer to the desk and made sure the monitor showing Rachel was clear and in focus.  “I didn’t know this woman was a prisoner at first…or I tricked myself into thinking she wasn’t because the money was good.  Either way, I know she is now.  She is in danger and so am I.”\n\nAfter lingering on video of her for a few more seconds to make sure every detail could be seen, I turned the camera back on myself.  I had to hurry, or the video might be too big to send quickly.  I was trying to stay calm, but I felt myself tearing up as I went on, and I did my best to keep my words clear.  “Please help her.  I don’t know where she is.  I don’t know who has her, because I don’t know who I really work for.  But they are bad people and she is not safe.”\n\n“All I know is that I work at a building at [redacted] right outside of San Antonio.  (Per Nosleep rules, to be clear this address is not real.) I only know the names of two other people connected to this place.  The man who hired me, Mr. Solomon.  And a man who might have a job like mine…Charlie Jeffers…no, Jefferies I think.  I don’t know if they are real people…I mean, I don’t know if that is their real names.  Please.  I’m not crazy.  I know how this sounds.  Just come here, see the room.  Figure out where she is and help her.  And…”\n\nI heard the muffled sound of the outer door opening into the locker room and I frantically fumbled with the phone to stop the recording.  How do I send?  Oh no, how do I…there it is.  I hit the button to share, and felt a new panic rising.  Who should I send it to?  I had only a handful of contacts, and I just selected them all.  Maybe at least one of them would take it seriously and get help.  As I heard the door to the surveillance room opening behind me, I hit send.\n\n**Not connected to data service or WiFi.  Please send again when connected.**\n\n*What?  No no no no…*\n\nI turned to see Mr. Solomon entering the room.  He was flanked by two large men in dark suits that looked like bodyguards or something.  Raising a finger, he wagged it at me.  \n\n“No service in here, Thomas.  But then you should never need service in here, so long as you followed the rules.”\n\n****\n\nThey took me easily.  I tried to make it to the bathroom and close the door, but the two guards stopped me and pulled me down.  They put the…what do you call them?  Zipties on my hands and feet and pulled a black bag over my head.  Then I was being carried out of the room and it felt like they must have put me in the back of a van that was pulled right up to the building.  I was laying on what felt like thin, weird smelling carpet that covered a hard metal layer underneath.\n\nI heard someone get into the van with me, and I asked where we were going.  If they would just take me and let Rachel go.  There was a short laugh overhead and then Mr. Solomon’s voice as he told me that he would explain everything when we got where we were going.  For now, he said, I needed to relax.  It was a long drive and I would need the rest.  \n\nI went to say more, but then I felt a sharp pain in my neck.  They had stabbed me, or…no, they injected me with something.  I was feeling so strange now, but I had to stay awake.  I had to try and get away, I had to…\n\n****\n\n“Hello again, Thomas.”\n\nI blinked as I began looking around.  My mouth was dry and my head hurt, but otherwise I felt okay.  I wasn’t tied up any more--Instead I was laying back on a padded table like I’d seen when I went to the doctor.\n\nBut this wasn’t a doctor’s office.  The room was large, and aside from the padded table, it held a small bed, a desk with a computer monitor on it, and a couple of chairs.  Sitting in one of those chairs was Mr. Solomon.\n\nI raised up slowly, blinking at him.  “Where is she?  Is Rachel okay?”\n\nThe man smiled.  “You really are something, Thomas.  Trying to be the hero, even if you don’t quite know how.  I respect that.”  Licking his lips, he leaned forward slightly.  “In fact, I respect that so much that I’ve decided to start our new relationship with as much honesty as I’m allowed.  Some of my colleagues disagree with this approach, but you know what?  Fuck them.  This is my project, and I think you deserve to know what’s going on.”  Looking more serious, he stood up, lifting the gun he had been holding casually in his lap.  “But before we get into the details, would you like to see Rachel?”\n\nI slid off the table and nodded as I caught myself from falling.  My legs were still wobbly from whatever they had given me, but I barely noticed.  “Yes, please.  Let me see her.  The real her.”\n\nMr. Solomon gave a small laugh and gestured toward a nearby door.  “Yes, reality is always best.  She’s just there in the next room.”  \n\nI stumbled my way forward, my legs getting better as I walked, and when I grabbed the doorknob, it turned easily.  I expected the door to lead to her bedroom, but instead it opened into another room a lot like the one I had been in, though the stuff in it was different.  Strange machines filled the walls, and in the back of the room was a large…aquarium?  I didn’t know.  It was a big cylinder taller than I was, and it was filled with some kind of gray liquid.   There was a shape in that liquid,\n\n“Go ahead, Thomas.  Feel free to go have a good look.  You’ve earned it.”  I felt my stomach clenching tighter at Mr. Solomon’s words and the meanness in them.  My legs felt heavy again now, but it wasn’t from the drugs this time.\n\nShuffling forward, I could see the shape was a person.  *Oh no*  Or at least a body, because it was clear from just looking at it that the person was dead.  It was very well-preserved, but I could see how the skin hung wrong and looked bloated in spots.  *Oh God, no no no*  Its hair, which had been floating like seaweed in front of its face, drifted away as I reached the glass, and I could see Rachel staring out at me.\n\n“Murderer!”  I turned on Solomon and started to run toward him when he shot me.  Suddenly I was on the ground convulsing as he stepped closer.\n\n“Don’t worry, Thomas.  It won’t kill you.  Just make you unable to move much for a bit.”  I heard more footfalls as my body began to still.  “Get him up, take him back to the other room.”\n\nI could barely feel anything as I was carried back to the padded table and propped up into a sitting position.  This time I was strapped down, but I guessed it was more so I didn’t fall off, because I couldn’t move anything other than my head, and even that just a little.  I could hardly see at all for crying, but I recognized the blurry shape of Solomon sitting back down in front of me.\n\n“Before you ask…well, when you are able to ask anything again, yes, that is Rachel.  Not a fake Rachel, not a dummy, and not some kind of trick.  As I said, the time for tricks is past.  Now is the time for truth.”\n\nFrowning slightly, he went on.  “Thomas, I understand that showing you that, showing you her body that way, might seem very cruel.  You may hate me for it right now.  I would understand it if you did.  But you called me a murderer, and at least in this specific context, I think that is unfair, because I didn’t kill Rachel.  In truth, I’ve been with this aspect of the project for only seven years.”\n\nHe gestured back to the door behind him.  “And Rachel has been dead for over eight.”\n\nI felt my eyes widen as though they belonged to someone else’s body.  It was more lies.  More tricks.  All of it.  Oh God, it had to be.\n\n“Do you know what remote viewing is?”  He rolled his eyes.  “Sorry, right, you can’t talk right now.  I’ll just assume you don’t.  Remote viewing is a broad term for the ability to see things that are far away from you physically, to know things you shouldn’t be able to know through your normal five senses.  Some describe it as a psychic ability, though there are several schools of thought as to how and why it works.”\n\nHis eyes fixed on mine intently.  “Because it does work, Thomas.  Various governments and private organizations have studied it for a very long time, and while publicly it is always ridiculed as pseudoscience and foolish superstition, the reality is that some people have the innate ability…that means it comes naturally…to somehow see other places.”\n\n“Rachel was one of those people.  She came into the program when she was seventeen, having been identified via a front-facing screening process that was ran as a psychological test that paid subjects well at a time when Rachel was looking to make some money.  Three months after being identified as a good candidate, she was taken, and after the initial adjustment period, she became a largely compliant asset that quickly rose to the top of our talent pool.”\n\nSolomon folded his hands on his knee.  “I know you cared for her, Thomas, so I think this is worth sharing.  Rachel was never treated badly, other than her confinement and the occasional test that was mildly unpleasant.  No, we all treasured her.  She was enormously talented, not just as a remote viewer, but as an artist.  That’s how she would convey what she saw, you understand.  She would enter into an almost trancelike state when she painted, and when she was done, she would have given us a painting of images and words that provided…well, it was very valuable information.”  He chuckled.  “If you ever wondered, that’s why there was always such care that the paintings were never shown to the camera.”\n\nPicking at his pants, he went on.  “Rachel was so talented, that she was selected for a new program that we thought might greatly enhance or alter her ability.  We introduced something…foreign…into her body.  At first, nothing seemed to change.  If anything, the accuracy of her remote viewing was declining, which was a problem for us and for her.”\n\n“But then we realized that we were reading the new paintings wrong.  She was able to see more clearly than ever--she just was no longer bound to only current events.  Now her sight transcended time.”  He paused, and I realized he was enjoying telling the story.  The bastard was having a good time, pausing to make it more dramatic.  I would fucking kill him.  “While this made some of her paintings less immediately useful, they became much more valuable as we were able to decipher them.  For a time, it looked as though everything was working better than we had ever hoped.”\n\nHis lips thinned.  “And then, one day, she showed a painting to the camera.”\n\n“It said, ‘Please help me Thomas’.  This immediately sent up all kinds of red flags.  She knew not to show paintings to the camera, and now she was trying to communicate with someone?  We didn’t disrupt her routine, but an intensive investigation began into who she was talking to.  Was it one of her handlers?  One of the technicians?  Someone from her past life?  But nothing checked out.”\n\nLeaning back in his chair, a look of pride grew on Solomon’s face as he continued.  “I was the one that first suggested the idea that she was, intentionally or not, knowingly or not, seeing and talking to someone in the future.  I was still an outside consultant at the time, but by that point we had more strange behaviors from her, including the second message painting, ‘That girl isn’t me’.  My theory made some sense, but it very quickly ran into a greater obstacle.”\n\n“The introduction of the foreign material had not been as seamless as we had hoped, despite her having been stable for almost three years since it was implanted.  Whether it was due to her increasing emotional upset and stress, or simply the passage of time, she suddenly began to deteriorate.  Her work became more erratic and hard to understand as her body began to decline.  We were monitoring her health closely, but it didn’t matter.  Five days after she painted ‘That girl isn’t me’, she suddenly went into cardiac arrest and died.  Somewhat inexplicably, we were unable to resuscitate her.”\n\nThe man sighed.  “This was a great loss.  And it required adjustments of my theory.  Based on everything we knew, it still made sense that she was talking to someone.  Someone with access to the camera feed, and very likely someone named Thomas.  If Thomas was viewing that camera footage in the future, as I believed, then he must be working for us in the future.”  He gave me a thin smile.  “And whether you believe that the future is set in stone or not, I’m all for giving it a helping hand.”\n\n“Seven years ago I began the Thomas Project.  Over the course of that time I have overseen the screening and hiring of forty-three men named Thomas at several different sites, all with one very specific job.  To watch the videos of Rachel from just before her implant to the time of her death.”\n\nI tried to speak, but my mouth still wouldn’t work.  I wanted to say he was lying, that it didn’t make sense, that it *was* another trick…but I think I wanted to hear it more for myself.  Because I didn’t think he was lying.  I didn’t think it was a trick.  And I thought I was starting to understand.\n\n“The point wasn’t really them watching the videos, of course.  It was how they *reacted* to watching the videos.  What they did, and how that matched up with what Rachel had done in response in the past.”\n\n“Thirteen percent quit after the first day.  Thirty-eight percent hit either the red or the green button after the first message asking for help and saying their name.  Twenty-two percent attempted to contact the authorities before reaching the stage where ‘Melanie’ was introduced.”  He shook his head slightly.  “I wish I could take credit for her introduction, but it wasn’t my suggestion.  We assumed from the ‘that girl isn’t me’ message that there was a double of Rachel introduced to you at some point, perhaps to kill you or dissuade you or find out what you knew.  But it took a few tries until we felt it was well-refined, and as I’ve pointed out, only twenty-seven percent made it that far.  And all of them failed the next test.”  He pointed at me.\n\n“Her name.”\n\n“You see, the girl you’ve been watching, that talented, wonderful girl whose body is preserved in the next room?  Her name was Rachel Donovan.  I had always wondered if Rachel was merely seeing you, or if there was some kind of connection between the two of you.  When you called ‘Melanie’ Rachel, I knew that we had finally found the right Thomas--the distant point of light that our Rachel was looking at across space and time.”\n\nI swallowed thickly and found I could feel my tongue, if only a little.  Slurring badly, I pushed out a single word.\n\n“W-why?”\n\nSolomon looked surprised.  “I’d have thought that’d be clear by now.  You’re our only remaining link to one of our greatest treasures.  Perhaps you have a similar ability, or it may be that she forged the link purely though her own talent and will.  But either way, you are important and you have more work to do.”  He stood up and moved over to the table where he turned on the monitor.  As it came to life, I saw it was a frozen image of Rachel’s room--a tape paused where I had left off watching.  Turning back to me, the man looked solemn.\n\n[“You have to watch the rest of it.  Because Rachel painted you more pictures before she died, and we have to know what they mean.”](https:\/\/redd.it\/9ndww5)\n\n**** \n\n[Final Part](https:\/\/redd.it\/bue2kk)"},"270":{"title":"They told me I was nothing but a dog","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/a1xyn9\/they_told_me_i_was_nothing_but_a_dog\/","flair":null,"author":"Dopabeane","selftext":"My father named me Laika because when I was born, my grandfather told him to treat me like a bad dog. To Father, *Laika* was synonymous with *dog*. He used the name to remind me of my place in the hierarchy: lesser. Beneath. Inferior.\n\nNothing but a dog. \n\nMy father meant to humiliate and degrade me with such a name, but he honored me instead.\n\nYou see, Laika was a stray dog from Moscow. On 3 November 1957, the Soviet Union put her on Sputnik 2 and launched her into space. She was the very first animal to orbit Earth.\n\nThe Soviets knew how to put a rocket into space, but they didn’t know how to bring it back. This made Laika’s mission a death sentence. Shortly after reaching orbit, the interior of Sputnik 2 became catastrophically hot – far too hot for mammals to tolerate. Mere hours after launch, Laika died an agonizing death. She perished the same way she’d lived: lesser, beneath, inferior. Abandoned. Unloved.\n\nNothing but a dog.\n\nI spent many hours imagining her terror, pain, and loneliness. How would it feel, spending my last hours hurtling through divine darkness in a metal bucket?\n\nWhat must it be like to not understand what I was seeing, or why it was suddenly so loud and so hot?\n\nWhat must it be like to not understand why – after being plucked from cruel streets and dropped into a bustling world of kindness – I was now alone? Perhaps I would think I’d been a bad dog. Perhaps I’d think this was my punishment.\n\nPunishment is my mother tongue. I know what it was like to be punished for transgressions I cannot remember or understand, to be hurt so badly my heart rate triples and my mind flies out the window and soars into the stars, retracing Laika’s doomed flight while my husk squirms and weeps on the floor of a dirty house sixty-eight miles below. \n\nEven so, I adapted to punishment. As I said, it eventually becomes a language. Given enough time, anyone can learn a language.\n\nWhat I could not adapt to was fear. \n\nAs a child, I was afraid of everything. You see, in the deepest, most forgotten parts of the world, there are things that most people cannot believe and even fewer would understand. Old ways, old things, old truths. \n\nAnd old monsters.\n\nMonsters like my father and my grandfather. \n\nHow can I describe this in a way you will believe? Maybe I can’t. Maybe I shouldn’t try. So instead, I will describe my grandfather.\n\nHe was called Paval. By the time I turned nine, he had gone through six bodies. By this, I mean he inhabited them. Using a variant of blood magic perfected by my forebears across many centuries, he leapt from body to body.\n\nHe was not a spirit; he had a corporeal body of his own, a twisted, monstrous thing covered in scars and hard, glittering skin, a body that could shrink to the size of a garden snake or expand to the size of a house.\n\nBut for all its marvels, this body was weak; sunlight burnt its eyes and blistered its flesh. So it entered other bodies, like a hand inside a puppet, and wore them until they rotted away. I will never forget the sight of him – of many hims – in different bodies as flesh degraded and fell away in wet, discolored strings. Or the way his eyes – hard, round yellow eyes – glinted deep within their stolen sockets.\n\nGrandfather preferred the bodies of men, but sometimes chose women or children. Once, he even wore the body of my mother. I was very young then – perhaps three – and the sight of her familiar form standing before the fire sent me into such transports of joy that I bawled from sheer ecstasy.\n\nThen she turned around, and in her bruised sockets I saw my grandfather’s eyes: flat, glittering yellow. Like rotted gold.\n\nI reared back, screaming.\n\nMy father, who had been stroking a pair of old baby shoes, looked at me with contempt so deep it scorched my heart. “Shut up, dog!”\n\nI cringed. This was a mistake; his contempt exploded into disgust. He shot out of his chair and stomped upon me. Dirty, squirmy pain exploded across my abdomen. I hobbled away, whimpering, and hid under the stairs.\n\nI lay there alone for many hours. Eventually my mind left my body and soared into the sky, a reverse dive into a sea of stars. I drifted away, dreaming of diamond-colored constellations and red nebulae. At my side was a curly-tailed dog with a striped face. My namesake. \n\nLaika.\n\nWhen I woke, I *felt* her: furry and warm, chest rising and falling under my hand. I opened my eyes. For just an instant I saw her in the shadows. Then she shrank away, sinking into the ground. I tried to grab her, but the floor swallowed her. My fingers closed on cold, hard floorboards. \n\nI covered my eyes and wept.\n\nSeveral months later, Grandfather-Within-Mother gave birth to a child. A baby boy with yellow eyes and my father’s curly black hair. Mere minutes after the birth, Father picked up the baby and took him outside. He returned an hour later, empty-handed.\n\nSpurred by horror, I immediately ran out into the night. The cold was brutal, at once invigorating and exhausting. I searched until I found the baby, whimpering weakly beside a snowdrift. He was still covered in birth blood.\n\nI named him Alexander and brought him home.\n\nWhen I walked in, Father immediately slapped me. I reeled back as stars rocketed across my vision. “Never,” he hissed, contempt dripping from every syllable, “never disobey again. Give him to me now.” He reached for Alexander, but Grandfather stopped him.\n\nI looked up, and swallowed a whimper. Grandfather stared back at me through my mother’s rotting face. The mouth – puffy and discolored, with an oddly detached look – quirked into a smile. “No. Let the dog keep her pup. We have other concerns.” \n\nThey certainly did; they worked together, and they worked constantly. Father kidnapped victims, and Grandfather used them. Whenever Father brought a new victim to the cabin, Grandfather used his hands – long, hideous things marked with scars and covered in strange, glittering flesh – to tear out the victim’s tongue and crush their feet. \n\nThen he would wait until nightfall – because remember, sunlight burned Grandfather’s eyes and blistered his skin - and carry them to his Chapel.\n\nHis Chapel was an ancient stone structure at the base of a wooded hill. Within the chapel were three red windows and six rough-hewn pews. At the end of each pew sat desiccated corpses, facing the altar like sentries.\n\nI hated Grandfather’s chapel; the very air weighed upon me whenever I entered, crushing my heart and poisoning my lungs. The worst part was the fear: electric and paralyzing, inescapable.\n\nLuckily, I was just a dog, and dogs do not spend much time inside chapels. But dogs hear screams. Even screams from far away, echoing down forested mountains long into the night. \n\nGrandfather did not often leave his Chapel, but when he did it was always in the wee hours of the morning. I know this because my father and I were required to hold vigil until he walked through our door. Whenever Grandfather came back from his Chapel, he looked human again: smooth skin, wide smile, good proportions. Sometimes he looked a bit like Father. Sometimes he looked like his victim.\n\nIt was as incomprehensible to me as outer space would have been to Laika. \n\nThe stream of Grandfather’s victims never ended. Vagrants, the elderly, the travelers, orphans fleeing violence. There were so many.\n\nSo, so many.\n\nIf it weren’t for Alexander, I would have withered into nothing. He was more than a brother to me; for all intents and purposes, he was my son. Neither Father nor Grandfather cared for him. They didn’t even feed or clothe him; I had to feed and dress him with what little I had. \n\nDespite my best efforts, he never learned to speak. That isn’t to say he couldn’t communicate – he could, with gestures and facial expressions and nonsense syllables – but language eluded him. But it was all right. He grew into a sweet, curious boy with freckles and long, delicate hands. Over time, his terrible yellow eyes mellowed into a clear, bright green. He was my life. He was my heart.\n\nBut he wasn’t enough.\n\nOne night, as a little girl’s screams came shrieking down the mountain from Grandfather’s Chapel, I finally went to my father.\n\nI lay prostrate at his feet, which is how he taught me to approach him. The wooden floor was rough and painfully cold under my fingers. “Why, Father? Why do you do this?”\n\nHe sat in his chair, watching the fire. In his hands he held a pair of white baby shoes. “Because your Grandfather and I must live, little dog.”\n\n“Will I have to do this to live?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Then I don’t want to live.”\n\n“I understand,” he said. His grip tightened on the shoes. “But you don’t have a choice.”\n\nI choked back a sob and waited for the dismissal; I could not come to him without crawling, and I could not leave until he told me so.\n\nInstead, he said, “Stand up, Laika.”\n\nHearing my name was like being doused in ice water. He never used it; by that point, in fact, I’d almost forgotten I had a name.\n\n“I said, stand up, Laika.”\n\nIt was a struggle to obey; fear made my bones rubbery and my muscles weak. \n\nFather held out the baby shoes. “What do you see?”\n\n“Shoes.” My voice quavered. “Old baby shoes.”\n\n“Those shoes,” Father said, “belonged my sister, Alexandra. I loved her more than anything. More than life. More than my parents. More than your mother. More than you. She was my heart.”\n\nI watched him. The firelight threw his face into relief, creating crevasses out of wrinkles. His curly black hair shifted like smoke, and his long, sharp nose looked strange and monstrous. Paralytic electricity swarmed my skin, so much like the Chapel that I could have wept.\n\n“On my twelfth birthday,” Father said, “your grandfather boiled a pot of oil and called Alexandra to him. She and I were going to pick wildflowers later, so she was dressed in her finest clothes: a blue dress and white shoes. These shoes.” \n\nFather did not speak for a very long while.\n\n“She was my heart,” he finally repeated. “When my heart broke, I broke. It made me like Grandfather. Someday, I will be just like him. I will live forever. You will, too.” \n\nThat night, I had a nightmare of a little girl with sunken yellow eyes melting into blisters as my mother’s rotted body doused her with boiling oil. \n\nI woke screaming.\n\nMoonlight streamed through the window, drenching my room in celestial silver. My heart thumped so wildly that I could see my nightshirt moving. It wanted to escape. I wanted it to escape, to, because without it I would die, and when I was dead I could sail the stars with the other Laika.\n\nSmall, warm hands touched my face. I turned, expecting Alexander. Instead I saw my nightmare. \n\nGreat inflamed blisters bubbled and burst, sending rivulets of pus down her tiny, raw face. The skin around its mouth had burned away, leaving neat rows of milk teeth fully exposed. Burned scalp and dull bone glinted through black, curly hair. A blue dress clung to her body. Oil dripped from the hem, soaking my blanket.\n\n“Don’t cry,” she whispered.\n\nAlexander stirred between us.\n\n“Get out,” I whispered.\n\nThe girl’s blistered chin quivered. “But you made me come here. Please let me sleep.”\n\n“All right,” I whispered, because I did not know what else to say.\n\nThe girl burrowed under my blanket. I watched, aghast, as she threw a bony, burnt arm across Alexander and drifted to sleep.  \n\nThat night, I did not sail the stars with Laika. Instead I sat awake, watching the apparition with mingled excitement and fear.\n\nJust before dawn, my door creaked open. I tried to shield the girl as my father stepped into the room. \n\n“What is that?” he asked sharply.\n\n“Please,” I whined. “Please, don’t.”\n\nThe girl shifted, and – incredibly – began to shrink. Her body flattened into nothing, leaving her dress crumpled on the floor. That sank away, too, leaving the cold, empty floor in its wake.\n\n“*What was that?*” Father screamed.\n\n“I saw it in my sleep –”\n\n“*Her!*” Father roared. “*Her*, not *it*!”\n\n“I s-saw her in my sleep,” I stammered helplessly. “When I woke, she was here.”\n\nSweat gleamed on Father’s skin, reminding me of stars. “Get dressed. You must see your grandfather immediately.”\n\nI fell to my hands and knees and crawled to him. \n\n“No,” he said. “Stand up. Bring the boy.”\n\nAlexander wept angrily when I picked him up. I ignored him and followed Father into the dark forest. The full glory of early spring bathed the landscape: pale beams of light shafted through the canopy, cutting the thick shadows with gold. Vermin crept through the undergrowth, and deer watched from a distance. The forest was always full of animals; Grandfather was no danger to the birds or beasts, after all.\n\nSoon the Chapel came into view: an ancient little church with a black spire, red windows, and frost-encrusted stones. \n\nFather ushered us inside. The moment I crossed the threshold, my skin began to crawl. Dread and fear swept over me. Alexander burst into tears.\n\nFather shoved me toward the altar. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the sentry corpses twitching. Chests rose and fell in jagged, senseless rhythms. One especially tall corpse with long copper hair turned as I passed.\n\nI covered Alexander’s eyes and stopped at the altar.\n\nShadows thickened and writhed against the back wall. Back in the pews, bones clattered and dried joints creaked.\n\nSomething blinked in the darkness behind the altar: great, flat eyes like golden moons, shining in the cold shadows. \n\nGrandfather.\n\n“The dog,” Grandfather intoned, “and her pup.” He snarled: a deep, bone-shaking rumble like that of a tiger. Teeth glinted in the shadows, a shining ivory arc wider than Father’s entire head.\n\n“Paval,” Father said urgently. “She had a nightmare. When she woke, it followed her out of the dream. It came alive. I saw it.”\n\n“Oh,” Grandfather murmured. “*Oh.*”\n\n“Our little dog has talent after all,” said Father.\n\n“All good and well,” said Grandfather, “*if* she loves her pup. Do you love your pup, dog?” He reared up from the shadows, twisted and sinewy and utterly inhuman. “Do you love him? Or do you feel *obligated* to him?”\n\nI opened my mouth to answer. Instead, I burst into tears.\n\nGrandfather laughed, a low roar that shook dust from the rafters overhead. “A weak bitch indeed. Our hope is in the boy, Mikhail. It was always in the boy. That is why we made him. Now go.” Those great yellow eyes flicked to the pews. “I do not like to tempt my sentries. Not when they are hungry as they are.”\n\nFear and disbelief battled across Father’s weathered face. “Do you not understand what I’ve told you? She creates life from thoughts.”\n\n“A poor substitute for what we require. Leave, Mikhail.”\n\n“But – ”\n\nGrandfather rocketed out of the shadows, a rippling mass of glittering skin and malformed limbs, and knocked Father to the stones.\n\nThe corpse-sentries uttered a deep sigh and continued to twitch.\n\n“Never,” Grandfather snarled. Sunlight poured through the crimson windows, imbuing him strange hide with a red glow. He looked like the sky. A starry piece of outer space. “Never defy me.” \n\nI waited breathlessly for Grandfather’s eyes to burst and his skin to sizzle – he was, after all, exposed to daylight – but it did not.\n\nMany moments later, Grandfather struck Father across the face and whipped back into the darkness.\n\nWe left. Father did not speak again until the cottage came into sight. Then he grabbed me and dragged me off the path.\n\n“Listen,” he growled. “Listen well. I can protect you from him. And…” He looked down at Alexander, eyes blazing with disgust. “When the time comes, I can protect you from *him*, too.  But only if you help me.”\n\n“Why should I need protection? He’s small, and loves me as a mother.”\n\n“Do you remember the story of Alexandra?” Father asked.\n\nI nodded.\n\n“Your story is coming. Only Alexander will be me, and you will be Alexandra.”\n\nMy heart fell to the cold earth. I carefully pressed Alexander’s head into my shoulder, shielding his face from Father. \n\n“Listen, dog. When next you dream of my sister –” His voice broke; he pulled away and ran his fingers through his hair. Tears shone in his eyes, which were huge and miserable over his quivering mouth. “When she comes again, bring her to me.”\n\n“All right, Father.” I had never seen him weep before; the sight was frightening and curiously thrilling. “I will.”\n\nFather nodded curtly, then left. I nearly followed, but thought better of it. Instead, I stayed in the forest with Alexander.\n\nAs the morning brightened and birdsong swelled to a symphony, I set Alexander upon the narrow path. He ran forward, humming a tune of his own composition. Shadow and sunlight dappled his skin, turning him into a woodland sprite. The trees were in full bloom: petals drifted down like snow, carpeting the earth in glistening white.\n\nAlexander pulled ahead. After a while, I couldn’t hear or see him; he’d drifted away, slipping into the deep shadows.\n\nPanic overtook me. “Alexander! *Alexander!*” I rushed ahead, grimacing against the pain in my chest. My heart thumped wildly, so hard I could see my shirt move; it wanted to escape again. “*Alexander!*”\n\nHe darted from between the trees. I halted, overcome with relief so powerful it took my breath away. Petals covered his head and shoulders. As I watched, one drifted down and settled on his nose. Wide green eyes glimmered above it, bright as the promise of spring.\n\nFor the first time in my life, my heart was so full that I wept.\n \nThat night, Alexandra came to me again, blistered flesh dripping down her face. Her eyes had melted away, leaving raw, swollen masses of flesh in her melted sockets.\n\nRemembering my instructions, I sat up. “Father,” I quavered. Alexandra reached for me blindly, ruined hands closing on shadows. “Father!”\n\nFather burst into my room, gasping. “Alexandra!” He shot forward, arms extended as if to sweep her up.\n\nShe turned.\n\nFather froze.\n\nAlexandra tottered toward him. “Mikhail,” she whined. “Mikhail, my eyes hurt.”\n\nFather collapsed and covered his eyes as Alexandra approached. She left a trail of pus and oil, shining like a tiny river in the moonlight.\n\n“Mikhail, my hands hurt.”\n\nFather wheezed miserably.\n\n“Mikhail, my skin is on fire and drips away.” She stopped before him and crouched. Father whimpered and whined like a beaten dog, twisting away from her hands. \n\nShe set her small hand on his cheek. Father squalled and writhed, but couldn’t break away from her. “Mikhail,” she wept. “You are just like him now.” She jerked and began to shrink, to sink, disappearing into the floor. The moment her hand fell away, Father leapt to his feet and ran.\n\nAfter that, he did not ask to see Alexandra.\n\nThis is good, because I did not see her in my dreams after that. I only saw Laika. I spent most nights drifting among the stars with that dear, doomed dog at my side. Imagined or not, the sights were glorious: incomprehensibly beautiful star formations, planets, great multicolored expanses of celestial mists.\n\n\nSometimes I woke, bleary and incoherent, and felt her fur against my skin. But by the time I opened my eyes, there was nothing.\n\nOne winter morning, I woke very early. My stomach growled immediately, and no wonder; Father hadn’t fed me for days. I’d fed Alexander with table scraps and tree bark. \n\nThat, I decided, would change today.\n\nI crept into the kitchen. There wasn’t much; there never was. But I scraped together what little I could, and turned around.\n\nMy grandfather sat at the table, great golden eyes shimmering in his terrible face. “Little bitch. What have you done to your father? He no longer hunts. He no longer eats. He no longer obeys.” \n\nI felt like I was back in his chapel: crushed by darkness, heavy with dread, on the verge of panic.\n\n“Your ability,” said Grandfather, “has not been seen on this earth for a thousand years or more.”\n\nOf course the ability wasn’t of earth; I’d no doubt come across it while sailing through space and breathing stardust. “It’s just nightmares.”\n\n“No. You take the dark things of the world – the fear, the hate, the pain - and channel them into physical form. And that is just the beginning. You will be able to do anything. You will make bodies. Permanent, perfect bodies for me…and for you.”\n\nThe relish in his voice made me sick.\n\nHe said, “Our women have always been weak and talentless. I thought the same of you, little bitch.”\n\nTears pricked my eyes and my bones thrummed as if struggling to break through flesh and run away. But it was no use; destiny had already bloomed between my grandfather and I, heavy and foul with the promise of despair. \n\nGrandfather whispered, “Listen closely, for you will only hear this once: *I was wrong.*”\n\nHe left. I ran to the window and watched him hurtle through the trees as sunrise threatened. Back to his Chapel. \n\nI waited until the sun was up. Then I ran to my room, bundled Alexander in every bit of clothing I could find, and left.\n\nWe followed the path for many miles. Our home was hours and hours from the nearest town; we wouldn’t reach it until long past nightfall. I could only hope that Grandfather wouldn’t notice our absence until the following day. It wasn’t an unlikely hope; Grandfather spent most of his time in the Chapel.\n\nThe second this thought crossed my mind, a glittering dark shape leapt out of the trees and knocked Alexander from my arms.\n\nI caught a blur of twisted limbs and nightmarish hands, of great yellow eyes like flattened moons. Alexander screamed as a torrent of blood splattered across the snow. It sank quickly, melting red canyons through the pristine white.\n\nGrandfather at me, narrow sides heaving. Then he leaned down and tore out Alexander’s throat.\n\nI screamed. Birds took flight and mammals ran through the undergrowth. The piercing note echoed off the mountains. The pain within it should have ended the world, but there was no one to hear and no one to care.\n\nGrandfather grinned. Alexander’s blood and sinews clung to his teeth.\n\nI broke. \n\nI felt it; the crushing weight of sorrow, the almost physical sensation of my spirit tearing and bleeding out into my guts.\n\nI fell to my knees and cradled Alexander’s head for hours.\n\nMy father finally found us around nightfall. He had a heel of bread and an oily chicken leg. He pressed them both into my hands, then left. \n\nI tore the bread into pieces and dropped them, one by one, into Alexander’s mouth. When he did not wake, I burst into tears and hurled the chicken leg into the woods.\n\nThe moon rose into the cruel, dark sky. Stars glimmered through the bare branches over head, creating a breathtaking fractal pattern.\n\nI flopped down beside Alexander, pulling him to my body. He was cold. Terribly cold. I held him anyway, keeping my eyes trained on the stars. My mind detached with great difficulty, like it was trapped in tar.\n\nFinally, it wrenched itself free and sailed upward, disappearing into a silvery sea of sky and stars, rocketing ever higher until I saw the Earth spinning below.\n\nLaika’s rocket zoomed past. I reached out and caught one of the metal bars near the nose. I could sense Laika within: her terror vibrated through the craft and leached into my bloodstream.\n\n“It’s all right,” I said. “It’s all right, Laika. I’m here. When you land, I will help you out and we will play together.”\n\nHer fear diminished, and so did her pain. So did mine. Together we sailed the stars, looking upon the Earth and marveling at the incomprehensible beauty around us.\n\nI woke cold, sore, and in more pain than I can describe.\n\nI sat up. Alexander’s stiff body broke away from mine. I reached for him blindly. A thin scrim of ice covered his eyes. The wound in his throat was an open horror, one I couldn’t look at for long.\n\nI drew my knees to my chin and wept. \n\nAfter a while, something warm bumped my hand. A wet nose touched my palm. I knew what I would see long before I opened my eyes.\n\nLaika’s striped face and dear curly tail made me smile, even through my tears. Stars glimmered through her fur, gently pulsing pinpricks of light.\n\n “What is this?” Grandfather’s voice echoed through the trees.\n\nRage flowed through my blood, exquisitely corrosive. Hate, I learned then, is pleasurable; it is fury and it is the basis of power. \n\nGrandfather erupted from the darkness, scaled skin shimmering like a river under the moon. “You waste your talent,” he sneered, “on a mutt. Not even your own pup! No matter. I will correct you.”\n\nLaika reared up and leapt, snout piercing one of Grandfather’s flat moon eyes. He screamed and shook his head back and forth. Laika fell to the snow, twisting, and quickly righted herself. Then she bit his foot. Her teeth sank through that impenetrable, immortal hide like butter. \n\nLaika was not large enough or strong enough to kill him, but she tore holes in him the way a match scorches holes in paper. Soon Grandfather was on his knees, mere feet from Alexander’s corpse.\n\nLaika came to me, panting, and collapsed in my lap. She bled from a thousand wounds: some small, some undoubtedly mortal.\n\n“Good dog.” My voice broke. I stroked her gently, willing those wounds to close. I was a monster. I’d used Laika just like the others had; calling her down on false pretenses, filling her with hope, before throwing her into the void. “Good girl. Good, good girl.”\n\nI looked up as Grandfather’s good eye slid to my dead brother. Something dark bloomed there: a wicked, corrupted hope. He curled in on himself, twisted body shrinking to a withered husk, and slid down Alexander’s throat. \n\nI screamed as Alexander’s body twitched and juddered. Then he sat up, bones creaking and frozen sinews cracking.\n\nHe smiled. His eyes shone like molten gold in a forge. \n\nLaika attacked again. Alexander’s face curled into a snarl as she bit and tore his skin, exhibiting an energy at odds with her awful wounds.\n\nI watched, helpless and hopeless and hurting, wishing I could detach and fly into the stars once more. Except there would be nothing there for me now; I’d called Laika down from the stars and doomed her.\n\nThe snow crunched behind me. I whirled around. Father stood there, watching me with contempt. In his hands was a sleek, gleaming shotgun.\n\nRelief and horror engulfed me. This was the end. My mind would detach, forever this time. The fear would finally end.\n\nLaika bit down on Grandfather-within-Alexander, who hit her. She whined, but held fast.\n\nFather stalked past me and cocked the gun.\n\n“No!” I screamed. “Don’t hurt her! *Don’t hurt her!*”\n\nFather pointed the gun at Alexander’s head and fired. Blood and viscera and dark, glittering flesh exploded across the snow.\n\nFather fired again, then reloaded, and fired again and again. Alexander’s head evaporated into red mist. Finally his body lurched, and Grandfather – small, bleeding, scaled Grandfather – slithered out of his throat.\n\nLaika caught and held him. Father pressed the barrel of the gun against his good eye and pulled the trigger as the sun broke over the mountains.\n\nFather stepped back. I reached for him, drunk on hope and gratitude, but he recoiled from me. In his weathered face, I saw despair and rage…\n\nAnd contempt.\n\nHe kept his eyes trained on mine as he placed the gun in his mouth.\n\n“No!” I screamed.\n\nHe pulled the trigger. Half his head evaporated, leaving a glistening mass like a fleshy geode. His body stumbled forward a step, then crumpled to the snow. \n\nIt took a very long time for the sun to burn Grandfather down to dirty oil.  Laika held on until the last scrap of skin melted. Then she stumbled to me and collapsed. \n\nI stroked her until her body shrank and sank into the ground, leaving nothing but a scattering of tiny, dim orbs: the stars I’d seen in her fur. I touched one. It was pleasantly hot. I gathered them up and slipped them into my pocket. I went to Alexander’s body – ravaged beyond description, broken in ways that did not see entirely real – and sat with him until nightfall. Then I stood and walked away.\n\nAnd life went on.\n\nAt first, I brought them back from my nightmares  – Alexander, Father, Grandfather, even Alexandra – but I quickly taught myself to starve and eventually kill my ability. It is not a good power; it is born of rage, despair, selfishness, and fear. \n\nAnd I cannot tolerate fear.\n\nBesides, dogs do not have such awful powers. It is good to be a dog, because they are not necromancers. They are not monsters. They are nothing more or less than the simplest and most loving of creatures.\n\nThat is why I will always be Laika the dog.\n"},"271":{"title":"A Conversation with a Stranger on the Bus","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/beyjh1\/a_conversation_with_a_stranger_on_the_bus\/","flair":null,"author":"flard","selftext":"“Huh?” I asked, pulling off one side of my headphones.\n\n*“I said I like your boots,”* the man repeated.\n\n“Oh, thank you.”\n\n*“I had a bunch of pairs exactly like ‘em for years and years—a good workin boot, ya know?”*\n\n“They definitely are, I use them every day on the job.”\n\n*“Where’s that at?”*\n\n“Turner Construction.”\n\n*“Ah, yes, yes.

My neighbors and I used to do that when I was a kid. My house was one of the first built in our neighborhood, then the rest came later. We probably explored every house on the block before they were finished—when they were just wood skeletons—maybe breaking a couple bottles too, to tell you the truth.”\n\n*“Of course ya did.

It seemed almost too simple, too easy. But here he was.\n\nDerek had a kindly face, wrinkles around his eyes and cheeks only added to the softness of his expression. His white hair poking out from beneath his flat cap stood out in the dark night.\n\n“That’s a lovely little patch you’ve planted. I can look after it if you like, I used to maintain the last garden here.” He said, breaking the silence that had followed since his initial words. \n\n“I know who you are. We need you.” Was all I could manage, the mental exhaustion and fatigue from the whole experience had built up, but his arrival was like finishing a bad day working at school. I felt like I could relax again, even if only a little. \n\n“Whats your name darling?” He asked.\n\n“It’s Kat. I live in flat 42 now.” His face lit up as I confirmed my flat number. \n\n“Prudence has gone?” He asked.\n\n“She’s gone. But the whole place is a mess, so many things are happening and the residents are suffering.” I answered. \n\nWe chatted for what felt like hours. Outside with nothing but moonlight. He told me how he used to consider the building part of the garden, a place for him to maintain, the residents just like the plants he looks after. \n\nI explained my whole experience since moving in. I told him about Jamie and I sobbed. Derek held me as I cried and made me feel safe, something I had forgotten the feeling of since receiving Prue’s note. He didn’t interrupt, he just listened.\n\nI told him about Natalia and the cultists, the problems they had been causing. He was particularly heartbroken when he heard that they had used Eddie and Ellie for entry. He had gone before they were born, but remembered Terri as a child and how sweet she was, he was pleased when I told her what a sweet adult she had become. \n\nMy claims that Prudence was the only person who knew how to kill the imposter neighbours were met with a skeptical expression which gave me some hope.\n\nDerek listened to my entire tale with barely a word. When I finished he stood up and asked me to follow him. I was confused, but I did as I was told. \n\nHe walked me to the entrance of the lift. I lifted my arm to check the time on my watch. We had been outside for quite some time and the idea of the creatures being inside made my heart pound and my stomach turn. \n\n“You are safe. It’s 12.32am, there’s no need to worry or to check your watch.” And with that he pressed the “call lift” button. Despite his insistence that I was safe my stomach continued to do gymnastics.\n\nIt felt like forever before the lift finally made the clunking sound that meant it had reached the bottom. I felt my whole body shaking violently as the doors opened, I don’t know what I expected to see, we were in the safe time zone but every time I looked at the life I pictured Jamie’s dead, crunched up body. \n\n“Step inside.” He said.\n\n“I can’t. Please don’t make me.” I begged\n\n“I won’t let anything happen to you. But you need to see something.” There was such sincerity in his eyes as he spoke. I had never trusted someone so completely so quickly, but every fibre of my being told me this man was entirely good. \n\nI stepped inside the lift.\n\nDerek stepped in behind me, placing a comforting hand on my shoulder as I hyperventilated. He gently turned me to face the panel of buttons that control where the lift stops.\n\n“What is wrong with this panel? Do you see it?” He asked cryptically. \n\nI studied the panel. Read all the numbers, counting them. I couldn’t see anything wrong. I tried. I really tried, but nothing seemed out of place at all. Everything you expected to find was there and nothing more. I shook my head, barely regaining my composure.\n\n“Can you take us to floor 9 please?” He smiled slightly as he made the request. \n\nI looked back to the panel to press the button, but floor 9 didn’t exist. I was so confused, I had counted the numbers, I was sure of it. Derek must have made it disappear. But the panel didn’t look any different to before. I can’t explain it, looking at it, I would have sworn blind nothing was wrong with it even once I knew, but floor 9 didn’t exist. Derek could see my frustration. It was like the building was now playing tricks on me. \n\nHe walked me out of the lift and sat me down on the bottom of the stairs before he finally began to speak.\n\n“The building is like a living organism. It can seal off parts of the world, and it can open up others you never could have imagined. When those awful people burned that whole floor of residents I was devastated.\n\n“Some wonderful people lived in those flats, both of the usual and unusual variety. But those people had no limit to their cruelty. Whole families burned alive, it was a tragedy that made me so angry. \n\n“I felt so guilty when it happened. I can predict what some of our more tricky residents are going to do and make sure I’m there to help. But those people were nothing to do with this place. I couldn’t see what they were planning, so I couldn’t stop it.”\n\nAt this point I noticed one of the hairless cats had sat between us, Derek looked at it with tears brimming in his eyes, he stroked it and it moved on to his lap. Dereks fingers didn’t burn at all. He continued.\n\n“When it happened the building used its defence mechanisms and sealed off the entirety of the floor. It stopped the fire from spreading and kept the perpetrators there, to die by their own hands.\n\n“The building only allowed the floor to be unsealed once they were dead. \n\n“It took about a week before those awful people turned up again. Asking for sugar at people’s doors, the first few let them in. It was so difficult, so many residents burned alive that I was having to use their remains for my garden just to hide the dead. The entire community were terrified and grieving for those that died. \n\n“No matter how hard I tried I still couldn’t predict them, or see them, so I took Prudence, who at the time seemed a perfectly reasonable woman, to the burned out floor.\n\n“Floor 9, however, had been sealed again. There was no button in the lift, and it always skipped on the stairs. Only no one had noticed. This building really is a magnificent creature.”\n\nI stared at him in amazement through the whole story, I was exhausted but my brain was working in overdrive to process what he was telling me. I had started to stroke the cat too, my fingers did burn, but I didn’t flinch, I found it’s company comforting. He carried on. \n\n“I went back later that night and took the stairs again, alone this time. I think my intentions were clear and the stairs allowed me access to floor 9 for the first time since just after the fire. \n\n“I bought Prudence to the floor within the hour. The stairs had stopped skipping floor 9 for me, although I later learned that when Prudence had tried alone she was not allowed access.\n\n“We explored the floor, walking amongst the remnants of our dead friends belongings. Eventually, we came across one of the soulless arsonists, roaming the halls. It appears that’s where they spend their time when they aren’t out terrorising the residents trying to claim more victims. \n\n“He was disturbed and disoriented to see anyone not like them on that floor. He twitched a little and spat out the sugar line as if it was an automatic response, I almost felt sorry for him. He claimed to come from flat 66. More were approaching behind him. \n\n“Prudence was terrified, she was starting to sweat profusely and back away from the man, but it didn’t cool her down, he was burning her slowly. I felt nothing; See, the stranger things in life just don’t seem to affect me, I’ve never known why. Sometimes I even just know how to deal with them, like it’s programmed into me. On this new playing field, in their domain. I knew what to do. \n\n“I grabbed the man and ran him down to flat 66, 4 doors from where we were standing. I threw him into the flat and waited. The other arsonists were approaching.\n\n“The man tried to exit the flat, that was doorless after the wooden doors all burned to cinders in the fire. But as he reached to door something stopped him. He couldn’t leave, no matter how hard he tried, or how much he screamed. \n\n“Prudence lit up, she grabbed hold of one that had tried to kill her friend, Molly. She remembered the flat number she had claimed to be from and repeated my actions, with a lot more sweating and some winces of pain. It worked again. \n\n“Prudence wanted to go after the rest, but as they got closer I could see the blisters forming on parts of her body, I dragged her out of the hallway and back into the stairwell. We ran. \n\n“She begged me to take her back, kept telling me that the stairs wouldn’t let her, that it was too dangerous. The residents had started to learn not to let them in and we had no casualties at all after we trapped the first two. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a problem I was intending to deal with, but it was around that time that we first learned the council would be building that monstrosity over the top of my garden.” He gestured to the window that just showed some of the neighbouring tower block.\n\n“This left me not at my best, my intuition was failing me when a few months after that, I allowed Prudence and Molly to heard the creatures from the lift to floor 9. It’s one of my biggest regrets. I should never have walked them up there. But I didn’t know she was going to burn them all. She didn’t give me a chance to reason. \n\n“I became mistrusting of everyone and distracted. Not long after I went away for a long while. So I guess the arsonists remained and now they’re threatening you.\n\n“Tomorrow I will go. I will fix the mess I left behind. I am so sorry it’s affected you so badly, I’d love to meet these twins. They sound incredibly brave.”\n\n“They are.” I finally interrupted, “And I want to be there tomorrow. I want to lock Natalia away for good.”\n\n“I can’t allow it. You’ll be attacked.” He cut me off entirely. I let it drop instantly but in the back of my mind I knew I would be there, no matter what. \n\nI went to sleep that night with my mind reeling. I wondered where Derek slept and if he even needed to. \n\nThe next morning I left my flat early, passed the man on floor 5, and sat at waited on the steps at floor 8. I tested it of course, and just like anticipated, ascending any higher took me straight to floor 10. Or 11 depending on if you hit a skip. So I returned to floor 8, and I waited.\n\nDerek hadn’t indicated what time he was coming. But I was ready. I would wait all day and night if I had to. But luckily I didn’t.\n\nDerek was climbing the stairs at around 11am, I had already been there for 3 hours but it had been worth it. He looked particularly unimpressed to see me. His face still looked kind though, even with the sour expression. \n\n“I can’t stop you can I?” He sighed, sounding resigned in his tone. \n\n“Not for anything.”\n\n“You have to promise to stay back. If you get your girl approaches you can do what you need to do, but you have to stay back.” He pleaded.\n\nI nodded and stood up. We ascended the stairs and for the very first time in my new life here I saw the big plastic sign saying 9. The floor that didn’t exist. \n\nAs we pushed through the door it was like entering an entirely new world. Everything was black. Burned to carbon. You could smell nothing but charcoal. Literally nothing but empty shells of homes and flakes of what used to be sentimental objects remained. It was devastating to witness. \n\nIf you’ve ever visited a mass grave site you’ll understand partly how I was feeling. It was sickening, to think of all the lives needlessly lost. But I didn’t get time to think.\n\nNatalia walked towards me. Flying down the hallway. \n\n“How the fuck did you get here?!” She screamed. Her eyes were wide and angry, I started to feel hotter already. \n\nDerek grabbed my arm and pulled me next to him. Making sure to keep a tight hold of my arm. \n\n“Where do you live?” Derek asked her, I started to back away as the sweat dropped from my brow. I desperately wanted to shout out the number, but I couldn’t. I was so hot, I wasn’t functioning properly, everything became so overwhelming I couldn’t remember what Georgia had said, what flat Natalia had claimed to come from.\n\n“I’m not that stupid. I saw what happened to them.” She gestured over her shoulder to what must have been flat number 66, where a man laid on the floor, breathing but looking broken. Just existing in that room. Prudence had been creative with the truth yet again. She didn’t kill them, you can’t kill them. \n\nWhat had Georgia said? I racked my brains as I felt the skin on my face start to sting. I imagined her melting away, it was happening to me. I was next. \n\nAnd then, as my hair started to singe at the ends, it came to me. \n\n“71!” I screamed as loud as I could. I could barely see as Derek grabbed her and ran towards me with her. She was clawing at his eyes and face screaming at him to let go. But he didn’t burn. He just kept hold of her. When he approached flat 71 he beckoned me over. \n\n“You do it. Then get off of this floor.” He was blunt but reasonable, I complied. \n\nI pushed hard. There was nothing but anger in her eyes, she pushed my face hard with her hand as I got her to cross the boundary into flat 71. I felt my skin sizzle and blister. My whole face was in agony, but I didn’t stop pushing.\n\nWatching Natalia try to fight her way out of a door that didn’t exist was both satisfying and humorous. The others had started to approach at the sound of the commotion. I lingered, hoping to watch her suffer but derek shot me one look and I knew. It was time to go, \n\nI ran out the corridor and back into the stairwell. I stopped for longer than I probably should have. But I knew I might not get to see that 9 again and it would be worth it. I waited for Derek on floor 9s stairwell. I couldn’t help but imagine the cultists burning to death the first time around. \n\nI could hear angry screams faintly from inside the corridor, they made me worry about Derek but I knew that really I didn’t need to. It took a while, but he eventually left the corridor and joined me in the stairwell. \n\nHe didn’t say anything, he just looked at me and the third degree burns across my face. He didn’t need to speak, I knew he’d fixed the problem. \n\nWe walked silently back down the stairs towards my flat. I looked back up at floor 9, knowing the building would seal it off for good. It took a few floors to reach floor 7 and I invited Derek in for a cup of tea. He rejected it, saying he wanted to go visit some old friends.\n\nDespite my injuries I couldn’t help but smile, something I’d done was going to help these residents. I stood at my door and watched Derek walk away, pleased that there was some true good in this building. \n\nAfter a few steps down the hallway, Derek started to fade, almost like a cgi ghost in a movie, every step he became more transparent. I felt my stomach turn again, like it had outside the lift. I ran out to follow him. I called after him but by the time I had reached where he’d been he was gone. I walked the entire corridor to the window at the back. I looked out the window into the small concrete heavy garden and hoped to see him sat on the memorial bench.\n\nI didn’t see him, instead I saw Prudence. Hacking at my tiny planted patch with shears.\n\nHow it ends: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/cmykhy\/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app"},"273":{"title":"Buying a weighted blanket from Amazon was the worst decision I’ve ever made.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/dv6c4p\/buying_a_weighted_blanket_from_amazon_was_the\/","flair":null,"author":"barkoholic","selftext":"You’ve heard of them. They started as a tool to help calm autistic people and people with anxiety and insomnia. Over the past few years they’ve grown into a popular household item, and with good reason. They’re comforting. \n\nWe’d pay just about anything for some comfort. Do you ever notice how that’s most of what we spend our money on now, us single guys? Why do we constantly crave to be comforted?\n\nMy life wasn’t particularly uncomfortable. Not then. I had finally gotten back track with reality after the disappearance of my wife and kids two years ago. I’d sold our little house in the suburbs, gotten a cheap apartment close to my job, attended all the therapy appointments the police and caseworkers recommended, and gone back to work. I still couldn’t sleep for more than an hour or two a night, even with the medications they gave me, but that was okay. The worst of it was over. Shock and grief can only last so long. \n\nI got one anyway; ordered the thing off Amazon. In queen size, like all my bedding, even though my queen no longer slept in it. \n\nIt arrived ridiculously late. I’m a Prime member, and I selected the free two day shipping. But it at least had gotten there, so I didn’t send a complaint, despite the state it was in after its long journey - not in the familiar smiley cardboard box, but in a shapeless lump haphazardly placed halfway on my front doorstep, halfway in the parking lot. It had been clumsily wrapped in brown paper and tied with a string, and possibly kicked the whole way here, from the look of it. \n\n“It’s like a quaint, rustic thing,” I announced (to nobody in particular) as I dragged it into my apartment. “A present from grandma, back home, uh, on the ranch!” \n\nBut even talking to myself couldn’t convince me. It looked like a bomb, delivered straight off the set of an action movie. The package was beaten up, stained, and the rough jute string was frayed and nearly falling apart. It looked singed in several places, too. It took me two hours, three gin and tonics, and a hearty microwave dinner to work up enough courage (or suicidal depression) to actually open the thing. \n\nThe blanket was bundled into a poorly-folded cube, held together by another length of the same string that had bound the paper. I wasn’t impressed with its packaging, but the blanket itself looked alright - plush, quilted blue microfiber with thick seams - and felt like it was the right weight. It smelled normal; you know that clean but vaguely chemical-ish odor new blankets have. \n\nI checked the tag, wondering if I ought to clean it, but the ink was smeared and blurry. It seemed risky to throw it in the washing machine without knowing the correct settings to use, so I just threw it over my duvet and went about my business. \n\nAt around midnight I decided to give it a try. I had nothing left to lose; I’d spent hundreds of dollars on my bed over the past few months; the newest and best quality memory-foam adjustable cooling mattress, thousand count Egyptian cotton sheets, customizable-filling pillows, and none of it had brought me a single good night’s sleep. Honestly I expected the same to happen that night, but it was fun to pretend. \n\nI slid between the cool sheets and pulled the blankets up over me. The new blanket was a bit lumpy, but I knew from reading reviews that this was normal due to shipping, and would smooth out over time. The weight was immediately noticeable, and to my surprise, I felt...comforted. \n\nWhen I closed my eyes, I imagined my youngest two had crawled into bed with us, and were laying on top of me, suppressing giggles as they tried not to wake me up. An artfully folded section of the blanket at my back became the familiar bulk of my wife beside me, and when I opened my eyes again it was ten in the morning and I was late for work. \n\nI’ve never been so thrilled to receive a write-up. \n\nThat weird chemical smell didn’t really fade, though, and gradually it became more noticeable. By the end of the week I could smell (or imagined I could) the strange, neutral odor on my skin, even after a shower. By the end of the month, it had become unbearable. \n\nI took it to a dry cleaners, thinking that I’d been lazy because I was so enamored over my renewed relationship with sleep. I was ready for the elderly Korean woman behind the counter to judge me over the stink. I had my excuses rehearsed; work was crazy, I’d had it in my car and forgotten, and I’d had Indian food for lunch and forgotten the leftovers in my car over the weekend, which had amplified the smell. \n\nBut I didn’t have a chance to recite this story. She only waved a handheld metal detector over my blanket and said, “Filling wrong. Can’t clean. Try spray with Fabreeze! You can get on Amazon!”\n\nI couldn’t imagine what about the filling could be wrong, and I told her so. Sure it was still a bit clumpy from shipping, but Amazon had listed the filler as polypropylene, and all the reviews recommended dry-cleaning. \n\n“Metal,” she explained, then shooed me out the door with twenty pounds of smelly quilt in my arms. \n\nAnother month of beautiful, comfortable sleep went by before I couldn’t live with the smell anymore. People had begun to comment on it at work. Megan, my manager, had tactfully suggested I check my laundry machine to see if maybe a rat had gotten in there and died or something. That was my last straw. \n\nI came home determined to get rid of the blanket and buy a new one. But you know what happens when you lose your entire world, with no answers? You start to cling to things. You hoard them. Because you can’t lose the comfort they bring you. \n\nI tried six dry cleaners before I found one who spoke enough English (through a heavy Boston accent; but you can’t have everything) to explain it to me. \n\n“Sometimes they fill these with glass beads,” he said. “The factories that make the beads, they‘ll lose a screw or some metal filings in the batch, and it all goes into the blanket. Machines in factories, you get me? Yeah, so what you can do is cut the seam a little and dump the balls into a bucket or the bathtub or something. Throw the blanket in the wash, hang it up to dry. Then you just pour ‘em back in and sew it up.”\n\nI told him I didn’t know how to sew. \n\n“You can get a funnel off Amazon for a few bucks,” he said, and shrugged at me in a particularly apathetic sort of way before turning back to a pile of stained panties. \n\nI did exactly that. They took a week to ship it, which was annoying, but it was a bank holiday that Monday so the delay made sense. \n\nArmed with my funnel and a bucket, I pulled the edge of the blanket over the bed and cut a tiny hole into the seam near the corner. I expected the beads to come pouring out in a clattery flood as soon as I dropped the corner into the bucket. Instead there was a single, loud thump as a lump of something metallic hit the plastic. \n\nI peered into it and saw a gold circle. A wedding ring with a fingerprint carved into it, and an inscription on the inside that I couldn’t see because a chunk of meat and bone were still inside it, but I knew what it said. It said “to love’s eternal glory”. It was my fingerprint on the band. \n\nMy mind went blank and I lost control of my legs, forcing me to sit heavily on the edge of my bed. The motion tugged the blanket over another few inches, and more of the filling came out. This wasn’t a flood, it was more of a...heave, like the blanket was vomiting up pieces of crumbling, dry flesh and bone. Like a cyst being squeezed, thick clumps of horribly recognizable stuff squirted out into the bucket. My oldest son’s teeth clattered loudly against the sides, and I saw flashes of silvery fillings from the cavities caused by gum disease he’d inherited from his mom. \n\nThere was a scrap of almost-bleached-white Hello Kitty band-aid wrapped around a tiny knuckle joint, and I remembered how my daughter had scraped her finger knocking loudly on her brother’s splintered bedroom door, and how she’d smiled through her tears when she saw the special, fun band-aid her daddy had put over the scratch. \n\nI’d been sleeping for two months beneath the heavy weight of a thousand mummified pieces of my wife and children’s bodies. \n\nThe cops couldn’t trace the package, even though they tried. The security cameras in my apartment complex showed an unmarked brown van with no license plate, which dumped the package directly from the window onto my front step. There was nothing to track. \n\nAmazon’s lawyers provided evidence proving they’d packed and shipped the correct (boxed and labeled) blanket. Let me be fair to them; I must say that they offered me a prompt refund. \n\nIn store credit. \n\nBut I won’t be buying anything off Amazon ever again. I’ve gotten rid of my Echo; that was the first thing I threw out, along with all my new bedding, and I canceled my Prime membership. Just for good measure, I threw out my smartphone and smartwatch as well. Amazon and smart technology are convenient and that’s great, but it’s not worth the risk if things like this can happen. \n\nIt’s the only possible explanation, after all - how else could they have found the bodies?"},"274":{"title":"Has anyone heard of the Left\/Right Game? (Part 10)(Final)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/7uyiss\/has_anyone_heard_of_the_leftright_game_part\/","flair":"Series","author":"NeonTempo","selftext":"Well then… here we are.\n\nI have to be honest; when I posted the first of these logs from my bedroom in North London, I didn’t think it would go very far. After all, why would it? I wasn’t a regular contributor to this site, nor a seasoned veteran of the paranormal. I was just a man who missed his friend, seeking a few words of wisdom from an online message board, open to the idea that it wouldn’t lead anywhere.\n \nSuffice to say I couldn’t have been more wrong.\n\nOver the past two months, the incredible advice I’ve received from this forum, and the amazing leads you’ve sent my way, have opened up entire worlds of possibility. It’s thanks to all of you that I’m where I am now; sitting in a rental car on a quiet street in Phoenix, Arizona, posting the last of Alice’s records.\n \nI realise I’ve written more than usual for my part. Apologies for this. If you want to skip straight to Alice’s section, that’s fine.\n \nOtherwise, please consider this the prologue to the epilogue.\n \nIt’s very, very early in the morning over here, with only the gravest of the graveyard shift out on the streets. By all rights I should be in bed, and not wasting petrol on an aimless drive through the city. The ritual helps me think however, and I’d recently been given a lot to think about, courtesy of a young woman at a local bar.\n \nShe was a forum member, who’d contacted me over Direct Message. When we met up earlier in the night, it was clear she’d done a great deal of research; charting every mirror shop in Phoenix in an attempt to reconstruct the route Alice took on February 7th 2017.\n \nWe spoke for quite a while; about the game, about Alice, and about life in general. Once closing time rolled around, she handed me a printout of the most likely route, with all the key locations circled. Then, in the final minutes before we parted ways, she nervously asked me two questions. The first put me in a rather sour mood.  The second provided the fuel for my 3am drive.\n \nQuestion One; Are you sure she wants you to find her?\n \nI’ve been hearing the same query from a few of you recently, especially since Part 9 was posted. People commenting that Alice made a clear choice when she left Rob behind in the silent city. That I was searching for someone who wasn’t seeking return.\n \nI’d like to take a moment to respond to this, as I responded to it earlier tonight. To be clear, the Alice I know wouldn't do that. She was planning to come back, she’d told us as much. I’m not going to waste your time with my theories, but we’ve seen what the road can do to people's minds, how it can carry them away against their better judgement. I understand why it's being asked but if those sorts of questions are all you have to offer, I’d kindly ask you find another way to help.\n \nQuestion Two was less clear cut; what are you going to do now?\n \nIt’s something you guys have also been asking me, but that was the first time I’d heard the question out loud. In the awkward silence that followed it became obvious to her, and in some ways to me, that I didn’t yet have an answer.\n \nI decided to take a drive while I figured it out… I’ve been in my car for the rest of the night,\n \nAfter an hour of aimless meandering, I realised I was close to one of the marked locations; the alleyway where Alice first entered the underpass, the point at which she first disappeared into the road. Turning into the side street, just after a large intersection, I was briefly relieved to see no sign of the tunnel. The part of me that still hoped this game was a fiction swelled at the sudden lack of evidence. My reaction was short lived of course, as I quickly realised that the tunnel wouldn't have shown itself to me anyway. Even if the game were real, I’d hardly been sticking to the rules on my way here.\n \nThere was no denying that the place resembled Alice’s descriptions however, and with a long time to go until I’d feel remotely tired, I decided to work my way back along the route, retracing Alice’s steps towards Rob Guthard’s street.\n \nOK so I have to admit at this point, I suffered from a momentary lapse in intelligence. In a fog of distraction, residual jetlag and general dullardry, I drove for longer than I’d care to admit under the misconception that I *wasn’t* playing the game. I thought this because I was heading in the opposite direction, and had started my run with a right hand turn, when the rules explicitly state that you begin by turning left. Of course, as I’m sure all of you would have realised immediately, that didn’t mean I was out of the game, it just meant I started playing with my first left turn, one road later.\n \nAlice was always the smart one.\n \nWhat I’m trying to say is that, due to this fairly mindless oversight, I wasn’t exactly looking out for the Woman in Grey as I drove past what should have been her corner. There wasn’t a mirror shop this time of course, that’s only the 34th turn when you’re coming the other way, in fact I’m not sure which of the many passing streets it was. It is strange though, as I think back through my journey, I feel like I would have noticed her. The streets were practically deserted, so much so that any pedestrians stood out immediately. I know I should’ve been looking more closely but, if you asked my honest opinion… I don't think she was there at all.\n \nThe moment I realised this, I felt it again; the faint perverse, hope that I’d been misled, that the entire story was nothing more than a twisted, elaborate fabrication.\n \nIt wasn’t long until I passed an old mirror shop and, 34 turns later, arrived on what must have been Alice’s starting street. It was an inner-city neighbourhood whose residents were all fast asleep. From the moment I realised that the game was in play, I’d been thinking less and less about this particular road, and more about the one directly after it, resting just beyond the crossroads. I’d come halfway across the world on the strength of Alice’s account, but I’d seen no first hand proof of the Left\/Right Game. If the whole thing was a hoax, then the next road should just be another street. If it was real, then I’d know soon enough.\n \nI crawled up to the junction with my heart in my throat. With every inch of road that passed under my tyres, I found myself hoping more and more that it wouldn’t be true. Let someone be playing a prank on me, let the logs be counterfeit... let Alice be anywhere else but on that road.\n \nI took the corner in a wide arc, parking myself in the centre of the crossroads, my headlights facing down the next turn.\n \nAhead of me was a quiet residential street; lines of neatly parked cars, rows of well-kept yards and squarely drawn windows. Yet at its centre, in utter defiance of the modest surroundings, the road sank into a deep and dimly lit corridor, cutting beneath the street, and disappearing into complete darkness.\n \nI’d always known it was true.\n \nIn the presence of grim confirmation, the question I was asked earlier that night started to ring in my ears, as if echoing out of the tunnel itself. After an entire night’s driving, after two full months of searching, I still didn’t have a response.\n \nIn the end I just left the engine running, as if turning it off would somehow be a sign of retreat, and decided to type up the notes you’re reading now. I thought maybe the process of putting it all down on paper would bring me clarity, and leave me with either a note of farewell or a note of apology to Alice, for not having what it took to find her.\n \nAnd now… here I am; still undecided, still writing, still sitting in this rental car on a quiet street in Phoenix, Arizona.\n \nThough perhaps the street’s not as quiet as I thought.\n \nI’ve just looked back to the previous road, down the street where Alice began her journey. As I type this very paragraph, I can see a figure standing on the sidewalk, just outside one of the houses. It isn’t the woman in grey this time.\n \nThough it’s almost too dark to make out, I can tell the figure is an older male, well built and imposing, the rugged features of his weathered face half lit by moonlight. I’ve never seen this person before, yet he bears a striking resemblance to another man; a man whose description has been well recorded within the pages of Alice’s logs.\n\nHe watches me in silence, staring through the window of my still running car.\n\nI wonder if he can help.\n \n[Part 1](https:\/\/redd.it\/7asz8x)\n \n[Part 2](https:\/\/redd.it\/7bkk41)\n \n[Part 3](https:\/\/redd.it\/7cf4h8)\n \n[Part 4](https:\/\/redd.it\/7dmuvp)\n \n[Part 5](https:\/\/redd.it\/7fdu9c)\n \n[Part 6](https:\/\/redd.it\/7h9jzb)\n \n[Part 7](https:\/\/redd.it\/7jabqd)\n \n[Part 8](https:\/\/redd.it\/7loh1l)\n \n[Part 9](https:\/\/redd.it\/7q3x6e)\n \n*****\n \nThe Left\/Right Game [DRAFT 1] 20\/02\/2017\n \nThe Left\/Right Game was once nothing more than a 9-page document, peeking out of a yellow envelope, resting quietly on my desk.\n \nI remember reading it on my lunch break.\n \nI remember it made me laugh.\n \nThe submission had arrived with the first post, quietly making its way around the office, treated by everyone as a short-lived novelty of little journalistic value. The story was easy to dismiss, appearing all too similar to the rambling ghost stories and blurry UFO sightings that filled our mailbox on a daily basis, and which most of the senior staff had learned to instinctively ignore. Doomed by association, the document was quickly passed over, my desk merely a pit stop on its way to the rejection pile.\n \nI was curious however and, after an uneventful few months in my new role, I had no compunctions about fishing from the scrap heap. Placing the envelope in my satchel, alongside a misfit crowd of similar rejects, I slipped away to a local coffee shop, reading it in an armchair by the window.\n \nSomewhere around page three, between the description of the game’s rules and the exhaustive list of “Required Skills”, my mouth started to curl into an irrepressible smile.\n \nThey’d been gloriously wrong about this one. It wasn’t some paranoid diatribe, nor a sensationalist plea for attention. Within those pages lay an introductory glimpse of a man’s passionate obsession. As I read on, something about his earnest eccentricity, incredible thoroughness, and unquestioning confidence made it impossible to put down. When I turned the final page, reading the last of Rob Guthard’s charming and refreshingly well formatted submission, I knew that this was the story I wanted to tell.\n \nLater that day, I found myself in the editor’s office making a case for it. They didn’t quite see what I saw, but I was intent to win them over regardless. I told them the story would be characterful, colourful, thought-provoking and, at the very least, that I wouldn’t be gone long.\n \nIt’s been twelve days since then; ten since I first entered the Wrangler in Phoenix, Arizona, five since I commandeered it myself, leaving Rob behind in the silent city. I haven’t updated much recently, save for a regular set of notes made for my own benefit. In all honesty, after I finished writing up my account of the city, I was struck by an overpowering sense of needlessness. There was no one left to receive these logs, no friends to proofread, no editor to hand them to. It seemed pointless to maintain the same prosaic format as before.\n \nI still largely agree with this assessment. It’s only due to a set of exceptional circumstances that I’ve chosen to type up the following account in full.\n \nWhoever this reaches, I want to thank you for reading up to now.\n \nI’m quite sure this will be my final instalment.\n \n*****\n \nThe moon has broken, and in my entire life, I’ve never witnessed an evening so still.\n \nThe air is cool and quiet, and the Wrangler cuts cleanly through it as I glide down a stretch of even tarmac. The scene is defined by calm and absence. Not a cloud in the sky, not a solitary whisper of breeze, not a single blade of grass stirring on the dark green banks beside me.\n \nYet even on a night as peaceful as this, I can’t help but feel far away from home. The city had served as a turning point in that regard. Before we reached those titanic monoliths, the landscapes we passed through generally resembled the world I once knew. A few obvious exceptions aside, there was nothing about the environments that looked truly divorced from reality. That’s all changed now. The aberrant aspects of this new world are unignorable, constantly hanging at the corner of my eye, passively injecting a sense of wonder and disconcertion into the otherwise silent night.\n \nA few days ago the moon started to crack like old porcelain. I hardly noticed at first, my eyes fixed on the road as it loomed above me, quietly splintering into three jagged pieces. As of tonight, the empty space between each fragment has significantly increased. If I focus on the sky for a little while, I can almost see them falling away from each other, charting infinite and lonesome trajectories through a barren cosmos, against a backdrop of foreign constellations.\n \nThe stars themselves fall further than they should. The night sky travels down past the horizon and continues below it, wrapping underneath the grassy bank. It’s as if the road, and the narrow plains on either side, are suspended in the middle of a vast abyss; a platform in the middle of open space.\n \nAt least that’s what I thought it was at first. It didn’t take long before I noticed the broken moon was appearing twice in the sky, both above and below me. A pair of orbiting satellites; identical and in perfect alignment. That’s when I realised that there were no stars below me. I was merely staring across a flat surface so flawlessly mirror-like as to cast a perfect reflection of the heavens above.\n \nI was driving through the centre of a lake.\n \nThe water is impossibly still. Since leaving the shoreline proper yesterday night, I’ve seen neither a wave, nor a ripple across its placid surface. It’s also undeniably vast, reaching beyond the horizon in every direction and continuing further still. Without being sure how I know, I’m aware that the waters carry on for an unspeakable distance, that I would sooner reach the stars themselves before setting foot on its opposite shore.\n \nI lean over and switch gears. The act of driving the Wrangler was a daunting one at first, but after the first two days I’ve managed to make do. An old scarf wrapped tightly around the steering wheel serves as a makeshift handle, allowing me to navigate corners one handed. I don’t have an elegant solution for the gearshift, but I’ve quickly grown used to the process. If I’ve learned anything from the road, it’s that grace is the first casualty in the fight for survival. Adaptability, no matter how clumsy, outlasts it at every turn.\n \nA few minutes later, the Wrangler pulls up to a spacious verge. A large circle of land surrounded entirely by dark waters. At the far end, the grass seems to fall away, dropping sharply into the lake with a dead stop. The road continues of course, but it's the only thing that does. With nothing on either side, it forms a narrow bridge of perfectly flat asphalt, raised on a bed of mud and rock.  \n \nI press my boot onto the brake pedal, easing the Wrangler to a steady halt at the centre of the clearing. For the first time today, I open the car door and climb out of my seat. The dull tap of asphalt shifts to a soft rustling as I make my way over to the lakeside.\n \nThere’s something on the shore, a barely discernible object, almost entirely concealed by a shock of verdant undergrowth. It’s a miracle I’d managed to spy it from the road, though perhaps something about the stark uniformity of the landscape had made it stand out. \n\nAs I advance towards the water, and the object draws near, its indeterminate form solidifies in my mind.\n \nIt’s a human arm, reaching out from the water and onto the bank. I crouch down to examine the few pertinent details. The fingers are still embedded firmly into the soil. The thumbnail is broken, coloured by a peeling coat of faded varnish. There’s a pallid, emaciated quality to the skin, spreading down the arm until it disappears beneath a thick, woollen sleeve. At the point it meets the surface, the water soaks into the fabric, turning it black from the original grey.\n \nWith a sad exhalation, I rise to my feet and lean over the water’s edge.\n \nThe body of Marjorie Guthard lies against the silt, her cheek resting on the lake bed, her wide bewildered eyes staring out into the open lake. She’s been almost perfectly preserved. Save for the striking tautness of her skin and its mottled, grey pallor, she looks exactly like the woman I saw on the 34th turn, who’d tried to repel me from the road, who’d spoken of a lake drinking her wounds clean.\n \nIt seems her ramblings weren’t completely void of fact. It’s clear to see that Marjorie has been exsanguinated, so completely in fact that the only evidence that blood ever flowed through her veins, is a large dark stain across her shredded blouse.\n\nIt doesn’t take long before the perpetrator makes itself known.\n \nAs I stare into the water, a steady stream of formless whispers sink up through the depths of the lake. The softly spoken murmurings drift up to my ears, taking root in the back of my mind and instantly blooming into a flurry of deeply persuasive promises.\n \nI find myself entirely transfixed by the still water, as a myriad of generous offerings unfold in throughout my consciousness. The whispers suggest an end to the phantom pains in my absent arm, perhaps even a completely restored limb, stronger than it had been before. Furthermore, it shows me a glimpse of its incomprehensible span, its furthest bank reaching across countless worlds, its deepest point lying below everything. I’m offered total knowledge of every league, every fathom, every inconceivable shore.\n \nMy hand reaches down as the whispers continue, every bargain steeped in sweet beneficence. A moment later, my outstretched fingers brush against the soft grass, and wrap around Marjorie’s exposed arm.\n \nDigging my heels into the ground, I lean myself backwards and pull. The water ripples and splashes as I drag Marjorie’s lifeless body slowly onto the bank. I feel the voices in my mind grow louder, erupting in anger as I back away from the lake.\n \nThe promises had been convincing, each quiet solicitation undeniably persuasive. But after seeing Marjorie’s wretched fate and the look of eternal betrayal in her vacant eyes, I found myself aware of a subtle undercurrent behind every syllable, a sense of desperation and timeless hunger emanating from beneath the lake’s surface. I already have a clear understanding of what would have happened if I’d lost myself to those waters. I suspect it’s no coincidence, that of the countless shores it showed me, all of them appeared to be deserted.\n\nMarjorie wouldn’t have stood a chance. She’d left the forest alone, grievously wounded and without a vehicle. She’d walked the whole way here, bleeding endlessly, the road’s rejuvenating power battling every moment against her body’s natural inclination to die. I suspect the road’s influence wasn’t strong enough, and when a whispering voice promised, ever so sweetly to mend her, she would have been in no position to refuse. \n \nHer other sleeve brushes against dry land, her body leaving the water for the first time in decades. I keep pulling until my boots hit asphalt, laying her down on the grass just beside the Wrangler.\n\nAfter a moment of sober vigil, I walk to the back of the car and fetch Rob’s foldable spade.\n \nA long few hours follow. I’ve never dug someone’s grave before, and my injury is hardly conducive to the task. My fleece tied around my waist, pearls of sweat running down my brow, I manage to slowly chip away at the damp earth. Five hours later, my back cramping, my hand raw from gripping the shovel, I attempt to lower Marjorie into the rough pit with some semblance of grace, her legs dropping limply into the soft soil despite my best efforts.\n\nIt takes over an hour to shovel the soil back. It’s a sobering and ugly task. As a layer of dirt covers her face, I realise this will be the last time a living person lays their eyes on Marjorie Guthard. Burying her suddenly feels disrespectful, as if it’s an act I don’t have the right to perform. \n\nOnce it’s done, I drop onto my knees, a dull ache in my muscles as I smooth out the disturbed ground with the back of the shovel.\n\n**MARJORIE:** You.\n\nEven before I turn to face her, I can hear a scowl in her voice. There’s an odious depth to that one acrid syllable, a potent witch’s brew of contempt and accusation that feels like it’s been festering in her drowned lungs for decades.\n\nReluctantly, I rise to my feet and turn around, finding myself face to face with the woman I just buried. She looks different now, her clothes are dry, her skin clear, with nothing to be seen of the deep, dark gash in her blouse.\n\n**AS:** Marjorie.\n\nUnlike the empty vessel below us, the woman in front of me is by no means at peace. She shakes and wretches with the same indignant fury I witnessed when we first met. When she speaks, her words shudder under the weight of her own turbulent emotions.\n\n**MARJORIE:**  I chased you. I ran to you. I… I gave him up for you.\n\n**AS:** I’m… I’m sorry Marjorie, I don’t know what you mean. Tell me what you mean.\n\n**MARJOIRE** The things I saw, things so beautiful. And I saw her, walking alone through the new worlds. I gave everything up for you!!\n\nI don’t know quite what to say. It’s pointless to ask her what she means, to try and understand her frenetic ramblings. In the end, I can only try to speak her language.\n\n**AS:** Marjorie I… I didn’t mean you to.\n\nMarjorie’s trembling breaths burst into a despairing fit of laughter.\n\n**MARJORIE:** Oh… oh yes you did. Yes you did. And now… now you’re here.\n\nMarjorie’s wild and volatile demeanour shifts once more, her laughter degrading further into a desperate crying panic.\n\n**MARJORIE:** And what do I do now? What- What do I do?!\n\nMarjorie cringes with the terror of the self-imposed question, placing her head in her hands and repeating it over and over again. As I watch her wrestle with despair, I’m struck by an idea I’ve never before considered. The disconcerting notion that, in death, we are not transported to a set destination by some ethereal attendant. That in fact, nothing is decided for us. Perhaps the manner in which we spend our afterlife is down to us, a decision we have to make ourselves.\n\nMarjorie is standing over her own lifeless body, still lost, still entirely unmoored. \n\nThere's no sign of boundless paradise, inescapable damnation or everlasting nothingness, and the common thread they share, a final release from the weight of our own agency, is similarly absent. Perhaps we never get that freedom, perhaps we continue like we always do, accompanied by all our imperfections, uncertainty and discontent. \n\nPerhaps we must choose our eternity.\n\nAfter all my time on the road, that’s possibly the most terrifying notion I’ve encountered. \n\n**AS:** He never stopped looking you know.\n\nMarjorie snaps out of her wretched despair, instantly aware of who I’m referring to, staring up at me with an expression I’ve never seen her wear before. \n\n**AS:** I saw him, walking on the road. He didn’t stop. He was never going to stop. I think he was looking for you Marjorie, he still is. \n\nMarjorie stares through me. For the first time since we met on that quiet Phoenician corner, I can see the faint spark of something other than misery and rage across her tear stained face.\n\nI hold her gaze for a moment more, before pulling my phone from my pocket. In a single sweep of my contacts, I delete every number except for one. A number I pulled from the Nokia during our second night on the road. A number that connects to a lost wanderer of the road.\n\n**AS:** I don’t know if this can help but… stranger things have happened.\n\nAs she stares up into my eyes, I feel like we’re finally meeting for the first time. Without a word, Marjorie reaches out a quivering hand and takes the phone from my outstretched fingers. \n\nBefore I can say anything more, Marjorie Guthard is gone.\n\nA few moments later, a refreshing breeze lands against my cheek, a soft zephyr, cooling my still warm face. It’s a welcome sensation, and the first movement I’ve witnessed in the air since I set out onto the lake. Wiping the sweat from my forehead, I stare quietly along the bridge, the breeze picking up around me.\n\nIt’s a subtle wind at first, brushing stray hairs across my forehead, chilling the perspiration on my neck. Yet as I reach my hand out, and feel the air slip between my fingers, I’m witness to a steady rise in both strength and magnitude.\n\nThe sound of the wind grows from a whisper to a howl, Seconds later, the hanging sleeves of my fleece begin to stream sideways. My hair lifts from my back, billowing in the throes of a developing gale. \n\nI back up against the Wrangler’s hood as the air finally erupts into a roaring, cacophonous cyclone. My hand reflexively seeks the sturdy frame of the Wrangler, my fingers wrapping around the grille, my arm tensing as the unrelenting wind threatens to drag me from the road.\n\nSquinting through the violent tempest, I focus on a single point in space, just above the threshold of the bridge.  In the midst of the storm, a jagged line of white hot light bursts out of the ether, tearing through the night’s fabric, a crackling fissure that widens and yawns, forcing apart the curtains of reality as they frenetically struggle to recombine. \n\nStaring through the shuddering fracture, I’m subjected to the briefest glimpse of a boundless, and impossible vista. It is a faraway place in both distance and time. An achingly beautiful and gloriously terrifying dreamscape, enduring on the majestic shores of infinity. Every moment there spans a millennium and unfolds in countless directions at once. Every passing shadow holds a darkness beyond measure, their edges burned by the glare of a waking sun which looks across every conceivable world with a hollow, rancorous intent.\n\nIn the midst of this maddening landscape, a singular entity approaches, gliding towards the portal with the clear intent to pass through. As it breaches the shuddering gateway, and the wind dies down around it, I stare up at its grand celestial form.\n\nThe being is unlike anything I’ve ever seen; composed entirely from electric arcs of brilliant, magnesic light which burst from a volatile and blinding central core. It sounds like a lightning storm, its plasmatic tendrils snapping and crackling, bursting chaotically through the night air before collapsing in on themselves. As they fall back into the creature’s centre, they emit pale clouds of vaporous fractals that fade softly into the air.\n \nSomehow, even as my eyes barely adjust to the stark light, I realise that the entity usually burns much brighter. It's dampened its glow for my benefit, so that it can appear before me without scorching my eyes from their sockets.\n\n**AS:** It’s you… isn’t it. You’re the voice I’ve been hearing. You’re the one who brought me here.\n \nThe bristling maelstrom of light hangs in the air, crackling and shifting, its transient limbs strobing with chaotic incandescence. Part of me wants to hide, part of me wants to run, but neither are an option anymore. Releasing my hand from the Wrangler’s grille I take a single step forward, standing on my own and staring up into the entity’s smouldering core.\n\n**AS:** Can I get an interview?\n\nThe creature doesn’t react. In the following silence, I feel it observing me. When it finally responds, its voice ruptures the night, echoing through my skull.\n\n**VOICE:** There is little time, but you may ask what questions you have.\n\nEach reverberating syllable forms a string of literal shockwaves in the surrounding lake, emanating outwards from the being in a perfect circle. I watch the waves roll into the distance, showing no sign of ever diminishing, and I think about what question to ask first.\n\nIn the end, it comes to me quickly; a promise is a promise after all.\n\n**AS:** What happened to Marjorie? Why did she do what she did?\n\nThe being pauses, as if considering its response. When it does reply, it speaks with a calm sobriety.\n\n**VOICE:** She glimpsed an echo of the future, dreamed of the road, of the things that it passes through.\n\n**AS:** Like whatever’s through there?\n\nI gesture through the gateway, which is now almost entirely blocked from view by the creature’s spiralling form.\n\n**VOICE:** She dreamed of untold frontiers. She saw a lone woman walking them. Over time, the fulfilment of that vision became everything to her.\n \n**AS:** But it wasn’t her… she thought she was seeing her own future… but it was-\n \n**VOICE:** It was you.\n\nThose three words, as they burst into the open air, casting three narrow waves across the boundless water, hit me with a deep and heavy force. Unbeknownst to myself, decades before I was even born, Marjorie had been driven insane by dreams of maddening grandeur, of a life of boundless possibility and true significance. She had given everything up to chase a shadow… a shadow that eventually turned out to be mine.\n\nI hadn’t just pulled Rob into this game, I was the reason for everything. I was the cause for the tragedy that befell his entire family, \n \n**AS:** She didn’t just dream those sights. You influenced her. You let her see them… the same way you made Rob see me in Aokigahara. You pushed and you prodded wherever you needed so that I’d end up here. Are you the reason Bobby got the rules in the first place?\n \n**VOICE:** Yes.\n \n**AS:** But… why? You toyed with so many lives across… across decades. Why me? Why does it matter that I travel the road?\n \n**VOICE:** Because across all humanity, across every conceivable permutation, you are the one who makes it the furthest.\n \nIt speaks plainly, as if the statement were a foregone conclusion. Yet its words strike me into silence.\n\nThe creature continues.\n\n**VOICE:** I’ve watched you work your way here, through skill and through tenacity… and undeniably through luck. You were brought here because of these qualities, and they will carry you further along the road than any other.\n \n**AS:** Then why didn’t you just bring me here? All that influence and you didn’t lift a finger… after everything that happened-\n \n**VOICE:** Events transpired as they needed to.\n \n**AS:** As they… needed to?! People died! Marjorie. Bobby. Ace. Apollo. Eve. Lilith. Everyone. They’re all gone. Do you not care at all?\n\nIn response to my words, the entity remains silent for longer than usual.\n \n**VOICE:** I care more than you know. There are things greater than your understanding, forces that exist beyond the realms of your comprehension that you would consider a threat to everything you hold dear. My actions were guided by a higher standard of knowledge. Your protests are predicated on false understanding.\n \n**AS:** You’re saying I don’t understand death?\n \n**VOICE:** You don’t.\n \n**AS:** ... That still doesn’t make it right.\n \n**VOICE:** Regardless, my influence is necessary. That which is necessary must be.\n\n**AS:** What even are you?\n \n**VOICE::** I cannot answer that question in any way you’d understand.\n \n**AS:** That's not good enough.\n\nThe creature doesn’t respond, as if it doesn’t feel it needs to. So far it’s returned my every argument with impenetrable certainty. From the domain it occupies, knowing what it knows, my arguments must seem entirely facile. Even if it did feel the need to justify itself, after seeing the place it hails from, I wonder if there’s any way I could ever comprehend its motives.\n\nStill, that doesn’t mean my arguments are invalid, and the creature’s lofty dispassion does little more than stoke my desire to oppose it.\n\n**AS:** And what if I don’t want any part of this?\n\n**VOICE:** You are travelling the aberrant strand; a singularly stable flaw in the fabric of reality. As it carries you further from the world you know, you will be freed from the influence of the old laws. You have already noticed the effects in those who settled the road, those who were lost to it and in yourself; energy without consumption, knowledge without requisite experience. You are shedding entropy, and causality and in time you will reach realms of understanding you cannot currently fathom. You will find answers to questions you never thought to ask. You will discover absolute truth. For this reason, you will carry on.\n\n**AS:** That’s the only reason?\n\n**VOICE:** Do you need another?\n\nIt doesn’t come across as a question, but rather another blunt statement of fact. I understand the effect it’s speaking of. Ever since the city, I’ve been encountering vague notions and fragmented ideas that occur to me randomly and without announcement. New avenues of thought leading to revelations that would otherwise lie beyond my mortal reach.\n\nI’ve started to comprehend things I could barely have conceived of back home, and though the onset of these notions had been terrifying at first, they grow less so with every passing day.\n\n**AS:** No… no, I don’t trust you. I don’t-\n\n**VOICE:** Your trust is immaterial. You will travel the road regardless.\n\nThe creature’s already stark glow starts to intensify.\n \n**VOICE:** I’ve watched you, on every turn … across every moment of your journey.\n\nOne of the creature’s countless protrusions lashes out at the empty air, forming another harsh, glowing fissure. It wrenches itself open in a few stilted jolts, a transparent, almost crystalline membrane stretched across the gap. Through it, I can see myself, in the centre of a cornfield, examining a block of C4 explosive.\n\nIt’s as if I’m staring into the past through a jagged shard of one-way glass.\n\n**VOICE:** I’ve watched you questioning.\n\nThough we can’t be seen through the aperture, I see the glasslike membrane shake with the force of the creature’s voice. As the window collapses, I can see the rows of corn thrown into a frenzy.\n\nA second arc lashes out at the sky, forming a second aperture. This time I’m expecting the sight before me. I see myself, crying in the forest… a silent radio by my side.\n\n**VOICE:** I’ve watched you struggle.\n\nThe second window closes. The creature has made its point.\n\n**VOICE:** I’ve watched you fight… to make your way here.\n\n**VOICE:** You will not turn around. \n\n**AS:** You make it sound like I don’t have a choice.\n \n**VOICE:** You do have a choice Alice, but you have already made it.\n\nAs much as I’ve grown to detest the creature’s presumption, in that moment, I know it’s right.\n\nWhat it’s saying is true. I’ve done things I never would have imagined in order to get where I am now. In fact, if this being hadn’t arrived at all, I’d already be heading out over the bridge. \n\nI’m not proud of what drives me; that same, ugly impulse that led me to refuse Rob’s offer of return, that made it so easy to leave him behind in the silent city. But there’s no denying the impulse is there. It’s been with me the whole time, long before I ever arrived in Phoenix, Arizona… and it’s buried deeper than I’ve ever wanted to admit.\n\n**AS:** Can I… do I get to say goodbye?\n \nThe entity says nothing. It hangs in the air, flickering and coursing with rupturing bolts of light. The next thing I hear is a faint mechanical hum emanating from the Wrangler behind me. Turning around, I pace briskly back to the car, opening the door and reaching into the passenger seat. My notebook is booting up, seemingly of its own accord.\n \nPicking up the laptop, I lift the lid as I march back towards the bridge. I stare up at the silent being before me. When I look down to the laptop, my email client is already displayed on the screen.\n \n**AS:** How… how long do I have?\n\n**VOICE:** Long enough.\n \nThe entity begins to regress, its arcs diminishing as the being at its core turns away. Its message has been delivered. There is nothing more to discuss. \n\nAs it passes through the gateway, into an unknowable world far removed from my own, I call out after it.\n \n**AS:** I’m still not certain I trust you.\n \nThe being focusses on me once more, as the fracture begins to close. A final set of waves pass across the surface of the lake as it solemnly replies. \n \n**VOICE:** … I remember.\n \nA moment later, the being is gone.\n \nI stand motionless in the middle of the road, the entity’s final remarks washing over me, its curious choice of words echoing in my head. In the renewed silence, the faint stirrings of an overwhelming and terrible revelation start to form in my mind.\n\nIt could have simply said that it knew of my mistrust, that it heard the overtones in my voice, saw the disdain across my face or otherwise sensed it in the space between us. Instead, the being spoke as if my current feelings were a memory, dwelling somewhere within its depths.\n\nIt was undeniable that my time on the road was changing me, but in all this time I’d never truly considered how those changes might evolve as my journey continues. \n\nI’d never thought about what I might gain, what I might lose… or about what I might inevitably become.\n\nA short while passes before I lower my eyes from the empty space above the bridge, to the screen of my notebook. Lowering myself down, I cross my legs and rest my back against the Wrangler.\n\nIf you’ve been reading from the beginning, you’ve finally caught up with me.\n\nI hope you’ll allow me a few personal messages.\n\nTo Rob. I hope you’re able to read this someday, and I am so, so sorry for everything I’ve done; for everything I may do. I hope you understand that I didn’t know, and that none of this was your fault. You did the best you could, and the days I spent with you were the most significant of my life. It was an honour to know you and I hope that, among these pages, you find the answers, and the peace, that you deserve.\n\nTo my mum and dad, I’m sorry I won’t be sending this to you. In the end, I was carried along this road by a profound selfishness, and I just can’t bring myself to face you. I can’t imagine the pain I’ll be putting you through, and I won't try to justify my actions. All I can say is that I love you and I’m sorry that my last act towards you was one of cowardice.\n\nAnd finally to you; the person to whom this message will be addressed. I’m sorry. I always thought I’d see you again someday, that the roads I took would eventually lead me home. That doesn’t look so likely now. Though I could say a lot to you, I’m not going to.\n\nBut I wish we could have been friends for longer.\n\nIt feels like a lifetime since I first arrived at Rob Guthard’s quiet street. I remember the uncertainty as I waited for him to open his door, with no concievable idea what was about to transpire. \n\nLike so many other things, that’s now changed. Despite being in an entirely new world, further from home than anyone’s ever been, I know exactly what’s going to happen next.\n\nI’m going to take a drive. Take a left, then the next possible road on the right, then the next possible left. I will repeat the process ad infinitum, until I wind up somewhere new. \n\nAnd from there I’ll keep driving, beyond worlds, beyond time, beyond the bounds of my imagining. To a place where the lake runs dry, where the broken moon drifts away, and the stars disappear in the rear view.\n\nTo a place where everything has fallen away, and the road is all there is."},"275":{"title":"My friend and I made “ghost pornography” for fun.

It started off with sexy cosplay, then I photographed Suicide Girls style, and finally, when I had people up to pay enough, solo porn.\n\nI used to live in a crappy kitchenette, but once I was successful enough, I was able to afford a nicer place. Things got better when I moved in with my new roommate, but also weirder.\n\nI’m not using our real names or our artistic names here because I’m scared as fuck.\n\nMy new roommie, Savannah, was a cheerful and sweet girl. Her perky personality had flocked plenty of followers and fans, way more than I had myself, and she was making some good money; for instance, she was a homeowner at 22.\n\nHer place was huge, and she decided to rent her extra room for an attractive price, as long as the other resident was fine with her vast collection of sex toys being displayed in the living room.\n\nI thought that was hilarious and we immediately hit it off, so the other resident became me. The fact that we were both nude models helped our friendship, but to be fair I had met some other girls in my field before, and most of them were a stick in the mud.\n\nSavannah was nice, tidy and amazingly respectful of my personal space. She didn’t act like she owned the place, even though she literally did. I had spent a good few months before things started to go south.\n\n“So, Ayla”, Savannah approached me over breakfast. “Would you be willing to collab with me? I have a request for a private two-girl job and I thought it made sense to invite you first since it will be so much easier to arrange our schedules.”\n\nI wasn’t doing much, just my nightly streaming, my regular sets and my sets for patreons. I asked more about the job.\n\n“Well”, she laughed. “I have to tell you it’s one of a kind. It’s nothing dehumanizing or anything, but it’s weird as fuck. This guy… he jerks off to shadows. He wants us to pretend we’re fucking them.”\n\n“Fucking the shadows?!” I asked, and laughed loudly. She confirmed, laughing too. It was insane, but relatively harmless, like when some guy paid me 5 grand to legally bind me to not show my feet to any other man but him for a whole year. So I only take my socks off to shower and it’s been months since I don’t go to the beach.\n\nWhen Savannah told me how much the client was willing to pay for such a thing, I was immediately in.\n\n“It will be so embarrassing, but kinda fun, right?” I said.\n\n“Yeah, and with that I can finally stop taking private requests and focus on other things”, Savannah replied, happily. She’s sort of a do-it-all artist – model, photographer, painter and so on.\n\nA few more e-mail exchanges with [shadowfucker@\\[redacted\\].com](mailto:shadowfucker@[redacted].com) and he had approved of me and discussed the details with Savannah. He wanted two videos a week – on Mondays and Thursdays, and each should be at least 30 minutes long.\n\nA very reasonable request, considering that, with my share of what he was paying, I could drop everything else and still live comfortably.\n\nHe would send us the equipment before the first week, then outfits every two weeks.\n\nI was the one to receive the large box from UPS, as Savannah wasn’t home. I knew she had a P. O. box to avoid disclosing her real address, but this one came straight to our place.\n\nWeird, but considering how big this client was, I could understand her making an exception for him, and didn’t say anything about it.\n\nLater that day, we opened the box. It contained some light strobes, a few large but hollow wooden and metal objects, eight sets of costumes – wigs included –, a photograph and a small package marked *otherworldly condoms*.\n\n“Wow, imagine being this lunatic!” Savannah grabbed the little package laughing, then opened one of them.\n\nThey looked nothing like regular condoms; they were more like those plastic bags you use to freeze stuff, but the material was so much thinner and slightly iridescent.\n\n“That’s probably something he made up to make it more realistic, right?” I asked, then read the instructions aloud. “When having sex with the shadows, make sure to protect your whole groin with otherworldly condoms. They can unfold to thrice its size.”\n\nThe outfits were actually cute and we spent some time deciding when we were going to use each of them; the client had perfectly guessed our sizes.\n\nThen the photograph finally caught my attention.\n\nIt showed the right way to arrange the equipment on the room, but funnily enough, the room depicted was incredibly alike to Savannah’s studio – our third bedroom. Unlike me, she didn’t often film\/shoot in her own bedroom, preferring to use a mostly neutral room where she could set up scenarios or just take cleaner pics and videos.\n\nI couldn’t help but feel that the picture had been taken exactly in her studio – *at the very place we lived.*\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe day of our first video came – a Monday. It didn’t take us more than 15 minutes to set up the whole equipment on the studio exactly like the picture showed. The objects projected large shadows on the room, and the lights were set to slowly move on their own, so our interaction with the shadows was like the strangest sexy dance – but at least we weren’t standing still for half an hour pretending to fondle the same empty spot.\n\nDespite thinking that it was wacky, Savannah was a professional and she diligently used the otherworldly condoms as requested. I used them as well, and for 35 minutes, we pretended to fuck shadows.\n\nI felt utterly ridiculous, but being used to doing solo videos, I pretty much knew how to do it. The color of the lights and the outfits really helped set a soothing mood that made it all less shameful.\n\nSavannah then turned off the cameras and looked at me.\n\n“It wasn’t awful, was it?”\n\n“It was okay”, I agreed. I could make a fool of myself for some good money.\n\n“Do you want to shoot a second one and end this week early?”\n\nBefore I could reply, her phone buzzed loudly.\n\n*From: <Unknown Number>: Remember, shoot twice a week. Separately.*\n\nWe stared at each other in confusion.\n\n“Maybe there’s a mic hidden in the equipment?” I suggested. \n\nWe searched the whole room but found nothing.\n\nI didn’t think much about it. Rich people are controlling. They know things, always. The client knew when we were going to film the first video, and of course he figured we would consider doing everything on the same day instead of having to disassemble the set and reassembling it again.\n\nI went about my day, and nothing strange happened. Savannah seemed much more alive because now she had time for her hobbies, and I was doing well enough to start sending my family some money, something I had wanted to do for a long time.\n\nWe were to send him the first video on the day we recorded the second and so on. On Thursday, Savannah told me the client loved our first video, and looked forward to the next. To get us a little more comfortable with our weird thing, we had some wine and put on jazz music.\n\nThis time things went smoothly, but I kept hearing some humming while we pretended to fuck the shadows. I was sure it wasn’t coming from the music.\n\nI asked Savannah and she didn’t hear anything. “Maybe you’re a bit drunk? Slow down on the wine next time, home girl!”\n\nFor our video number 3, I was completely sober and asked Savannah to do it without music. She agreed, and in the total silence, I still heard the humming.\n\nIt was a humming that wasn’t there before, and it didn’t come from the light strobes either. I was so focused on it and intrigued that my face looked really unsexy and Savannah’s editor called to ask if there was an issue.\n\n“She just keeps listening to some humming. Yeah, I’ll tell her to see a doctor. Think you can mostly show her from behind? Cool, you’re an angel!”\n\nSavannah looked more worried about me than anything else, so I promised to see a doctor. Maybe something was wrong with my ear – even though something only felt off while we filmed the videos; at least now I could afford some high-quality healthcare.\n\nBetween the filming of videos 3 and 4, I got my ears checked, but they were perfectly normal. Savannah reiterated that it was totally cool if I wanted to give up on this freaky fetish-video thing and she would get another girl for that, no hard feelings.\n\nBut I didn’t feel like the videos were the problem. There was just this weird *thing* I couldn’t quite understand.\n\nOn video 4, Savannah was tipsy and seemed to be really enjoying herself. I felt a little guilty that she was clearly overcompensating for the fact that I was worried and gloomy on the previous video.\n\nThe humming evolved to whispers. And for the first time, I heard – no, it was more like understanding for the context, with the intuitive side of my brain – a few words.\n\n*“I actually like this.”*\n\nAt last that’s what I foretold that the whispers said. It probably sounded more like *sfslsosls dlsowllss swowllls*.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nOnce again, I didn’t tell anyone. I was almost convinced that I was actually being crazy. It was just an eerie feeling because I was stripping to and groping empty spaces twice a week.\n\nOn the Friday after recording video 4, we got a new box with outfits. There was another photograph, instructing us to rearrange the lights and boxes to, I imagine, create different shapes with the shadows.\n\nI couldn’t restrain myself this time.\n\n“Savannah, don’t you think this pic looks exactly like your studio?”\n\n“Yeah, that helps a lot, right?” she smiled, and then slowly realized what I meant, her smile withering. She grabbed the photo from my hand. “Oh, now that you said it, it’s quite alike. But of course no one broke into the house, right? I think that’s a standard room.”\n\nBut she sounded shaken.\n\nI think that’s the reason why she completely forgot the otherworldly condom.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nWe made the preparations as usual; changed the setting as the photo instructed, dressed up, put on our wigs and make-up. \n\nThe whispering immediately started, and for a moment I got lost in it, trying to understand.

There's no way I can respond to each of you individually, so I'm just going to address some common things again, and then move on to the stories. I'm going to write as many as I can think of, in addition to my friend's stories, and I will probably not update again until I get a chance to answer some questions that I myself have for my superiors.\n\nAlright, so the common questions I found you all had:\n\n* I am not comfortable talking about where exactly I work, unfortunately. In all reality some of the things I've mentioned here could get me in a lot of trouble or fired, so it's best if I just don't discuss too much. I will say that I'm in the United States, and in an area that is comprised of a great deal of wilderness. We're talking hundreds of miles of thick forest, with a mountain range and a few lakes.\n\n* There is still a great amount of interest in the stairs, and luckily for you guys my friend has a story that I think you'll all be very interested in. I'll go into that more at the end of this update. As for whether or not I have ever thought of asking my superiors about them, I have, but again, I don't want to risk my job. However, one of my former superiors no longer works as an SAR officer, and it's possible that he may be willing to talk to me about it. I'll be speaking to him later in the week, and I will let you all know what comes of that.\n\n* As far as advice on becoming an SAR officer goes, I think the best advice I can give is to contact your local Forest Service office and see if they offer and training courses, or what the qualifications are. I've been doing this for years, and I started out as a volunteer helping on SAR operations. It's a great job, despite the occasional tragic situations, and I wouldn't want to do anything else. \n\nAlright, let's move on to the stories:\n\n* The first happened on a case that I went out on right after I got out of training, and was still pretty new to everything. Before I took this job, I was a volunteer, so I had a basic idea of what to expect, but on those calls you're mostly dealing with finding lost people after vets have found signs of them. As an SAR officer, you go out for all kinds of cases, from animal bites to heart attacks. \nThis case got called in early in the morning, from a young couple who were up on one of the trails that goes by the lake. The husband was completely hysterical, and we couldn't really figure out what was going on. We could hear the woman screaming in the background, and he was begging us to come up there right away. When we get there, we see him holding his wife, and shes got something in her arms. She's screaming these awful, almost animal-like screams, and he's sobbing. He sees us and he screams at us to help them, to please get an ambulance up there. Now obviously we can't just drive an ambulance up the walking path, so we ask him if his wife needs help, or if she can walk on her own. He's still hysterical, but he manages to tell us that it's not his wife that needs help. I go over while one of the vets tries to calm him down, and I ask the wife what's going on. She's rocking, holding something, and just shrieking, over and over. I crouch down and see that whatever she's holding, it's covering her with blood. That's when I notice the sling on her front and my heart sinks. I ask her to tell me what's going on, and I sort of pry her arms gently open so I can see what she's holding. It's her baby, obviously dead. His head is caved in on one side, and he's covered in scratches. Now, I've seen dead bodies before, but something about this whole situation hits me hard. I have to take a second to compose myself, and I get up and go get one of the other vets, who's standing by. I tell him that it's a dead kid, and he sort of pats my shoulder and tells me he'll deal with it.\nIt took us over an hour to get this woman to let us see her kid. Every time we try to take him from her, she flips out and tells us we can't have him, that he'll be okay if we just leave her alone and let her help him. But eventually, one of the vets manages to calm her down, and she gives us the body. We took it back to the med area, but when the EMTs showed up, they told us that there was never any hope of saving the kid. He'd died instantly from the trauma to his head.\nI was good buddies with one of the nurses who met them at the hospital, and she told me later what had happened. Turns out the couple had been walking with the baby in the sling, and they stopped because the kid was fussing. The dad takes the kid and is holding him, looking out over this little gully by the path. The mom comes to stand next to him, but she ends up stepping on a loose patch of soil, and she trips. She falls into the dad, who drops the kid, who ends up falling about twenty feet down this little gully onto the rocks at the bottom. The dad climbed down and recovered the kid, but he'd fallen right on his head, and was dead by the time he got there. The baby was only about fifteen months old. It was a total freak accident, a series of events that coalesced into the worst possible outcome. Probably one of the more awful calls I've been on.\n\n* I haven't seen a lot of animal bites in my time as an SAR officer, mostly because there aren't that many animals that come around the area. While there are bears in the area, they tend to stay pretty far away from people, and sightings are highly unusual. Most of the animals you'll see are small ones, like coyotes, raccoons, or skunks. What we do see frequently, though, are moose. And let me tell you, moose are nasty fuckers. They'll chase after anything for any reason, and god help you if you get in between a female and its baby. One of the more amusing calls was of a guy who'd gotten chased down by an absolutely massive male moose, and was stuck up a tree. Took us almost an hour to get him down, and when he was finally on solid ground again, he looks at me and says: 'God damn. Them fuckers is big up close.' I guess that's not really a scary story, but we still laugh about that one.\n\n* I honestly don't know how I'd forgotten this story, but it is, by far, the scariest thing that's happened to me. I guess maybe I've tried so long to forget about it that it just didn't come to mind right away. As someone who spends literally all of their time in the woods, you don't ever want to let yourself get scared of being alone, or out in the middle of nowhere. That's why when you have experiences like this, you tend to just forget about them and move on. This is, to date, the only thing that's ever made me really seriously consider if this job is the right one for me. I don't really like talking about it much, but I'll do the best I can to remember it all.\nAs I recall, this took place right at the end of spring. It was a typical lost-child call: a four-year-old girl had wandered away from her family's campsite, and had been missing for about two hours. Her parents were completely despondent, and told us what most parents do; my kid would never wander away, she's so good about staying close, she's never done anything like this before. We assure the parents that we'll do everything we can to find her, and we spread out in a standard search formation. I was partnered with one of my good buddies, and we were sort of casually holding conversation while we hiked. I know it sounds callous, but you do sort of become desensitized when you've done this long enough. It becomes the norm, and I think to a certain extent you have to learn to desensitize yourself in order to work this job. \nWe search for a good two hours, going well beyond where we think she'd be, and we come out of a small valley when something makes us both stop in unison. We freeze and look at each other, and there's almost a sensation like a plane depressurizing. My ears pop, and I have this odd sensation of having dropped about ten feet. I start to ask my buddy if he felt that, but before I can, we hear the loudest sound I've ever heard in my life. It's almost like a freight train passing directly by us, but it's coming from every direction at once, including above and below us. He screams something to me, but I can't hear him over this deafening roar. Understandably freaked out, we look all around us, trying to find the source of the sound, but neither of us sees anything. Of course, my first thought is a landslide, but we're not near any cliffs, and even if we were, it would have hit us by now. The sound goes on and on, and we're trying to yell to each other, but even standing close together we can't hear anything but this sound. Then, as suddenly as it starts, it stops, like someone threw a switch and cut it off. We stand there for a second, perfectly still, and slowly the normal sounds of the woods come back. He asks me what the fuck just happened, but I just kind of shrug, and we stand there looking at each other for a minute. I get on the radio and ask if anyone else just heard the end of the fucking world, but no one else hears it, even though we're all within shouting distance of each other. My buddy and I just sort of shrug it off and keep going.\nAbout an hour later, we all check up on the radios, and no one's found the little girl. Most of the time, we won't search when it gets dark, but because we don't have any kind of lead on her, a few of us decide to keep going, including me and my buddy. We keep close together, and we're calling out for her every couple of minutes. At this point, I'm hoping beyond hope that we find her, because while I may not like kids, the idea of them being out all alone in the dark is awful. The woods can be intimidating to kids in the daylight; at night, well, it's a whole different beast. But we're not seeing any signs of her, or getting any responses, and around midnight, we decide to turn around and head back to the rendezvous point. \nWe're about halfway back when my buddy stops and shines his light to the right of us, into a really thick deadfall, or group of dead trees. I ask him if he's heard a response, but he just tells me to be quiet a second and listen. I do, and in the distance, I can hear what sounds like a kid crying. We both call the girl's name and listen for any kind of response, but it's just this really faint crying.\nWe head in the direction of this deadfall and go around it, calling her name over and over. As we get closer to the crying, I start getting this weird feeling in my gut, and I tell my buddy that something isn't right. He tells me he feels the same way, but we can't figure out what it is. We stop where we are, and call the girl's name again. And at the same time, we both figure it out. \nThe crying is on a loop. It's the same little hitching sob, then wail, then quiet hiccup, repeated over and over. It's exactly the same every time, and without saying another word, we both take off running. It's the only time I've ever lost my composure like that, but something about it was so incredibly wrong, and neither of us wanted to stay out there anymore. \nWhen we got back to the rendezvous, we asked if anyone else had heard anything strange, but no one else knew what we were talking about. I know it sounds sort of anti-climactic, but that call fucked me up for a long time. As for the little girl, we never found a trace of her. We keep an eye out for her, and all the other people who we've never found, but frankly I doubt we'll ever find anything. \n\nOf the missing persons calls I've gone out on, only a handful have ever resulted in a complete disappearance, meaning no trace of the person and no body ever found. But sometimes, finding a body just leads to more questions than answers. Here are some of the bodies we've found that have become infamous in our team:\n\n* A teenage boy who's remains were recovered almost a year after he vanished. We found the top of his skull, two finger bones, and his camera almost forty miles from where he was last seen. The camera, sadly, was destroyed.\n\n* The pelvis of an older man who had vanished a month earlier. That was all we found. \n\n* The lower jaw and right foot of a two-year-old boy on the highest peak of a ridge in the southern part of the park. \n\n* The body of a ten-year-old girl with Down's Syndrome, almost twenty miles from where she'd vanished. She had died of exposure three weeks after going missing, and all of her clothes were intact except for her shoes and jacket. There were berries and cooked meat in her stomach when they did the autopsy. The coroner said it appeared as if someone had been taking care of her. There were no suspects ever identified.\n\n* The frozen body of a one-year-old baby, found a week after vanishing in the hollow trunk of a tree ten miles from the area he was seen last. There was fresh milk found in his stomach, but his tongue was gone.\n\n* A single vertebra and right kneecap of a three-year-old girl, found in the snow almost twenty miles from the campground her family had been at the previous summer.\n\nNow on to  a couple of the stories my friend told me. I mentioned that you were all interested in the stairs, and you're in luck: he's had a closer encounter with them. Though he doesn't have any explanation for them, he does have a bit more experience with them than I do. \n\n* My buddy has been an SAR officer for about seven years, he started when he was a junior in college, and he had a very similar experience when he first encountered the stairs. His trainer told him almost the same thing mine did, which was to never go near, touch, or ascend them. For the first year, he did just that, but apparently his curiosity got the better of him, and on one call he broke away from the line and went to go check a set of them out.\nHe said they were about ten miles from the path where a teenage girl had vanished, and the dogs were following a scent. He was on his own, lagging behind the main group, when he saw a set of stairs off to his left. They looked like they were from a new house, because the carpeting was pristine and white. He said that as he got closer, he didn't feel any different, or hear any weird noises. He was expecting something to happen, like bleeding from his ears or collapsing, but he got right up next to them and didn't feel anything. The only thing, he said, that was odd was that there was absolutely no debris on the steps. No dirt, leaves, dust, anything. And there didn't appear to be any signs of animal or insect activity in the immediate area, which he found strange. It was less like things were avoiding them, and more like they just happened to be in a relatively barren part of the forest. He touched the stairs, and didn't feel anything except that sort of sticky feeling you get from new carpet. Making sure his radio was on, he slowly climbed the stairs; he said it was terrifying, because the way they'd been stigmatized, he wasn't really sure what was going to happen to him. He joked that half of him expected to be teleported to some other dimension and the other half was watching for a UFO to come swooping down. But he got to the top with little event, and he stood there looking around. But, he said, the longer he stood on the top step, the more he felt like he was doing something very, very wrong. He described it as the feeling you'd get if you were in a part of a government building you have no business being in. As if someone was going to come and arrest you, or shoot you in the back of the head, at any second. He tried to brush it off, but the feeling got stronger and stronger, and that's when he realized that he couldn't hear anything anymore. The sounds of the forest were gone, and he couldn't hear his own breathing. It was like some kind of weird, awful tinnitus, but more oppressive. He climbed back down and rejoined the search, and didn't mention what he'd done.  \nBut, he said, the weirdest part came after. His trainer was waiting back at the welcome center after the search ended for the day, and he cornered my buddy before he could leave. He said his trainer had this look of intense anger, and he asked what was wrong.\n'You went up them, didn't you.' My buddy said it wasn't phrased as a question. He asked how his trainer knew. The trainer just shook his head.\n'Because we didn't find her. The dogs lost her scent.'\nMy buddy asked what that had to do with anything. The trainer asked how long he'd been on the stairs, and my buddy said no more than a minute. The trainer gave him this really awful, almost dead-eyed look, and told him that if he ever went up another set of stairs again, he'd be fired. Immediately. The trainer walked away, and I guess he's never answered any of the questions my buddy has asked him about it since.\n\nMy buddy has been involved in a lot of missing persons cases where there's never been a trace of them found. I mentioned David Paulides, and my buddy said he can confirm that those stories are, for the most part, accurate. He said that most of the time, if the person isn't found right away, they're either never found, or they're found weeks, months, or years later, in places they can't possibly have gotten to. One story he told me really stood out that involved a five-year-old boy with a severe mental disability.\n\n* The little boy vanished from a picnic area in the late fall. In addition to the mental disability, he was also physically handicapped, and his parents explained over and over that he simply could not have vanished. It was impossible. Someone had to have taken him. My buddy said they searched for this kid for weeks, going miles out of the accepted range, but it was like he'd never been there. The dogs couldn't pick up his scent anywhere, not even in the picnic area where he'd apparently vanished from. Suspicion fell on the parents, but it was pretty clear that they were devastated, and hadn't done anything sinister to their kid. The search was concluded about a month later, and my buddy said everyone had pretty much forgotten it by later in the winter. \nHe was out on a training op in the snow, on one of the higher peaks, when he came across something in the snow. He said he saw it from far away at first, and when he got closer, he realized it was a shirt, frozen and sticking part way out of the powder. He recognized it as belonging to the kid, because it had a distinctive pattern. About twenty yards away, he found the kid's body, laying partially buried in the snow. My buddy said there was no way the kid had been dead for any more than a few days, even though he'd been missing for almost three months. The kid was curled around something, and when my buddy brushed off the snow to see what it was, he said he almost couldn't believe what he was seeing. It was a big chunk of ice, that had been carved crudely to look sort of like a person. The kid was holding it so tight that it had frostbitten his chest and hands, which my buddy could tell even with the decay that had taken place. He radioed the rest of the crew, and they took the body off the mountain. \nNow, he recapped all of this for me, and to put it simply, there was no way this kid could have both survived for almost three months on his own, or have gotten to this peak. There was no physical way this child could have walked almost fifty miles and ended up on the top of a god damn mountain. To top it off, there was nothing in the kid's stomach or colon. Nothing, not even water. It was like, my buddy said, the kid had been taken off the face of the earth, put in suspended animation, and dropped on this mountain months later, only to die of exposure. He's never really gotten over that one.\n\nThe last story I'll share from him was one that took place relatively recently, only a few months ago. \n\n* They were out doing a recon for mountain lions, because there had been several reports of sightings in the last couple of days. One of our jobs is to scout out the areas where these animals are seen to ensure that if they are in the area, we can warn people and close off those trails. He was out on his own in a very heavily forested part of the park toward dusk when he heard what sounded like a woman screaming in the distance. Now, as most of you know, when a mountain lion screams, it sounds almost exactly like a woman being brutally murdered. It's unsettling, but far from abnormal. My buddy radioed back and let ops know that he'd heard one, and that he was going to keep going to see if he could figure out where its territory started. \nHe heard the mountain lion scream a couple more times, always from the same spot, and determined the approximate area of the mountain lion's territory. He was about to head back when he heard another scream, this time within only a few yards of him. Of course, he freaks out and starts heading back at a much faster pace, because the last thing he wants is to run into a god damn mountain lion and get mauled to death. As he got back on the path and started heading back, the screaming followed him, and he broke into a jog. When he was about a mile from ops, the screaming stopped, and he turned around to see if it was following him.\nIt was almost night by this point, but he said in the distance, just before the path rounded a corner, he could see what looked like a male figure. He called out to them, warning them that the paths were closed, and that he needed to come back to the welcome center. The figure just stood there, and my buddy started to walk over. When he was about ten yards away, the figure took, as he described, 'and impossibly long step' toward him and let out the same scream my buddy had been hearing. My buddy didn't even say anything, he just turned and sprinted back to ops, never looking behind him. By the time he got back, the screaming had moved back into the woods. He didn't mention it to anyone else, just said that there was a mountain lion in the area and that they would need to close those paths until the animal could be located and moved. \n\nI'm going to end this entry here, since it's turned into a huge wall of text. I'm going to be heading out on a yearly training op tomorrow morning, so I'll be gone until early next week. I'll be meeting with a  lot of former trainers and buddies who work in other areas of the park, and I'll be asking around about any stories they'd like to share. I'm so glad you guys have been interested in my stories, and once I'm back from this op, I'll continue to share them!\n\n**EDIT: Part 4 is up: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3jadum\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/**"},"277":{"title":"I found the bunker of a prepper family who went missing three years ago","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/11txaos\/i_found_the_bunker_of_a_prepper_family_who_went\/","flair":null,"author":"ChristianWallis","selftext":"Dr Daniel Vance was a smart man. Too smart for his own good, maybe. Forty years old, a lecturer in fluid dynamics with a mind made of shapes and numbers. No one knows why but one day, on a whim, he crunched the numbers on the apocalypse and came to a troubling conclusion. He didn’t share exactly what it was he’d deduced, but given that he immediately quit his job and liquidated his many assets, it’s fair to say it wasn’t positive. Swept up in the wake of this tremendous upheaval was his wife, a twenty-four year old PhD student who had grown infatuated with Daniel some time before. She loved the strange bear of a man who could just as easily build a log cabin as he could explain the idiosyncrasies of an asteroid’s orbit. Speaking to Daniel always left you with the profound impression he was right, so when he told her what he wanted to do, she agreed.\n\nFifteen years and five children later, the Vances were living in the distant woods just beyond my hometown. They were enigmatic, richer than the Pope, and extremely serious about their prepper lifestyle. But they were also funny, easygoing, and incredibly compelling to speak to. Larger than life survivalists who swept into town with bizarre requests that thrilled local businesses. Vast quantities of cement, iron, lead, and steel were all shipped through the remote mountains so that the Vances could build their shelter. The advanced methods they used to keep it secret were legendary. Daniel had once spent six months earning the licence necessary to drive HGVs up to his compound so that no one else would lay eyes on it. And on one occasion when a company had refused his request for GPS tracker-free vehicles, he bought them out wholesale so that they had no choice.\n\nSo when they stopped appearing in town during the pandemic, when requests for food and goods stopped and all contact was dropped, most attributed it to lockdown. They had a bunker and had spent their entire lives training to be self-sufficient in the face of civilisation’s collapse. Even Alexander, the youngest at just three, was already collecting firewood as a chore, and learning what local plants were edible. Most of us just assumed that if anyone could ride out Covid without breaking a sweat, it would be the Vances.\n\nThe reality turned out to be something else.\n\nWhen the worst came to light, we discovered that Daniel had used the pandemic as an excuse for a dry-run. The family intended to spend six months in lockdown and essentially beta test their fallout bunker. Three months in and the Sheriff received a distress call on the radio. Coordinates were provided by the hushed voice of a sobbing child that most assume was Alexander, even though that’s never been proven.\n\nThe police arrived and found the bunker still sealed. It took hours for emergency responders to cut into the door, all the while efforts were made to contact the family within but to no avail. Once inside, police were left dumbfounded. There was no one to be rescued. No bodies. No survivors. There was evidence the door’s locking mechanism had failed and trapped the Vances inside with no way out, but if so where had they gone? \n\nBeds and cots lay everywhere with mouldering yellow sheets, buckets close to hand with stains all around them. Some doors were barred, others smashed to pieces. There was even evidence of makeshift quarantines and, in places, what looked like violence. The police, usually a fantastic source of gossip, were not forthcoming until the town demanded answers and the Sheriff was forced to offer only the barest of outlines. \n\n*An outbreak of a waterborne illness had struck the Vances down not long after they were locked inside and unable to seek help. Rumours of contagion were overstated, fuelled by the unrelated rise of Covid. Whatever contaminant had killed the Vances, it was non-organic in nature. No need to panic. The Vances loved-ones had been notified. The bunker was going to be demolished, and we could all put this terrible tragedy behind us.*\n\nOf course we still had questions. A thousand of them. Why hadn’t the family called for help? They had radios, computers, smartphones too. They were survivalists, not Amish. And where *were* they? What had happened to their bodies? Why hadn’t they simply left? We shouted these and more at the town meeting but the police simply refused to comment. For most of us the excitement lasted another week or two until we realised we weren’t getting answers any time soon. Besides, the pandemic was in full swing and most of us had other things to worry about. The tragic story eventually faded until it was just one of those awful things in the town’s history that we didn’t talk about. I was as guilty as anyone else of just forgetting about it.\n\nI certainly never expected to find the bunker out there in the woods, faded police tape still on the open door that hung wide open with scorch marks around the lock. It stood out in the woods like someone had cut a hole right in the fabric of reality, the darkness so deep and black it almost ached to look at. The sight of it made my heart drop into my stomach. It radiated pain. Does that make sense? I think some part of my lizard brain picked out details that wouldn’t become apparent to me until I got closer, like the bloody finger streaks that stained the handle from where someone had scrabbled furiously at the lock without success. And the tiny viewing window had been smashed with a hammer that still lay nearby. I needed only to glimpse it to imagine the family taking turns to stand there and scream into the woods desperate for rescue. \n\nUnder any other circumstances, I would have run.\n\nBut I’d gone there looking for my dog, and my light revealed a few wet paw prints making their way down the dusty concrete tunnel. Half Bernese and half collie, Ripley is the sort of dog who trembles in my arms when a storm buffets the windows and needs his paws held when we brush him. I love him. I do not have much of a family, or a wife, or even many friends. But I have Ripley, and I could no more have turned around and gone home to an empty apartment where I would have to sob my grief away than I could flap my arms and fly. He was my dog and I’d raised him since he was a puppy, and I wasn’t going to leave him out in those woods.\n\nI went in after him.\n\nI didn’t know what to expect, but I knew it wouldn’t be good. Whatever the police had found, they’d not only kept most of the morbid details to themselves, they had also lied. The bunker was not demolished, or even sealed off. In fact, looking at the occasional blue latex glove tossed aside and the one or two broken police-issue flashlights, it seemed like the last people inside had been in a hurry to get out. Given this was where seven people had presumably died, I assumed it was *someone’s* job to clean it all up. But the corridor looked largely untouched. Just a few metres in and manic writing started to cover the walls, the desperate scrawls of a lone survivor left there to be rediscovered like cave paintings. Most were deliberations on how to get out. Diagrams. Blueprints. Equations and formulae. All focused on the door and the circuits responsible for its faulty lock. I instinctively assumed they belonged to Daniel and that he’d been the last to die. What a God awful fate for a man to outlive his children. And yet it got worse. Slowly the writing changed from equations and plans to a desperate scrawl. The same few phrases repeated over and over. \n\n*Five doors. Five. Not six. Six. Didn’t make it. Didn’t make it. Six doors. Six.*\n\nIt seemed like the kind of thing you’d find in an asylum. A psychotic rambling punctuated only by six paragraphs right at the end. Each letter was impeccably neat, and each small paragraph was topped with a beautifully drawn Christian cross.  \n\n*Elliott Vance aged fifteen. A gifted guitarist. He liked boys even though he thought I did not know. I loved him with everything I had. He would have made a great man.*\n\n*Alicia Vance aged fourteen. She liked to paint and to shoot. She had her mother’s mean streak. It would have served her well in the future.*\n\n*Elijah Vance aged eight. The smartest of us all…*\n\nThese were Daniel’s memorials to his family, and seeing the words lit up by my torch was a haunting insight into the overwhelming despair he’d endured. He must have realised he wouldn’t get the chance to speak at his family’s funerals or to write their obituaries. This was his last desperate way of making sure the world might one day know them as he did - as real people.\n\nThe words marked the end of the tunnel, standing adjacent to a trapdoor in the ground. It was not open but the tunnel came to a dead end immediately afterwards and Ripley’s prints disappeared at the hatch. I feared he might be in danger, but still I stopped and looked at the bunker door twenty metres behind me. The once gloomy forest looked so bright, even on this cloudy day, the air dotted with rain. A part of me felt like I was leaving the whole world behind as I began to climb the ladder down.\n\nI entered a large circular living space that was packed with furniture and little nooks and crannies. The walls were covered with folding beds and tables and every inch was multifunctional. A dining space could become a sitting space, which in turn might be where someone slept, or even exercised. It all depended on what particular bit of furniture you unfolded or unclipped or unfurled. Seven people in close quarters, nowhere near enough privacy, it made sense they went with this cluttered overlapping use of space. But it was still a large room, bigger than most studio apartments. And there were a few corridors that led deeper into the Earth telling me the bunker had unseen depths. \n\nI looked for some sign of my dog and soon found his trail, but this far from the rainy copse Ripley’s prints were starting to fade. After barely a few metres they petered out vaguely in the direction of a nearby door. I wanted to follow but stopped myself from rushing onwards. It was unlikely Ripley was getting out any other way, and I’d do us no good getting hurt myself. I decided to take a look around and quickly spotted a dinner table. \n\nIf I needed proof the police had not bothered with a clean up, this was it. The plates were still out, the food rotten to a strange blackened husk. A child’s hat lay across one place-setting, the once-creamy fleece turned a sickly green and yellow. The chairs had their backs reinforced with wooden beams fitted with long grooves so that something the width of a nail could slide into them. And on each of the cushions were foul smelling stains that looked oddly like an ass print. I touched one with gloved hands and the material crackled audibly. Whatever it was, similar stains were on the cutlery and plates, and there were even handprints of it placed firmly on the tablecloth. At first I thought it was blood, but that wasn’t quite right. It was too contained to be from leaking blood. On the back of one of the chairs a stain tapered exactly where a woman’s waist would be like a near perfect silhouette. I shivered as I remembered that Miranda Vance had always been a slim woman and wondered how she had left her imprint on the grey fabric.\n\nUsing my torch, I saw that these stains repeated in the oddest of places. Yes, there were some on beds and blankets and even patches of plain floor exactly like you might expect in a room full of sick people. But why did one stain on the floor bear such a strong resemblance to a child huddled in the foetal position? And why was the same stuff all over the tv remote, and on books on shelves, and board games too. Everything from sofa cushions to DVD boxes to piles of dirty laundry were covered in the same dried brownish material that gave off a foul coppery miasma.\n\nI found the jigsaw particularly baffling. Someone had set up another table with four chairs, all modified with the same back support as those by the dinner table. And a jigsaw had been lain out with four separate piles, but only one was depleted. The rest looked largely untouched, almost like someone had portioned out pieces for three other people who had absolutely no interest in going along with it. Maybe Daniel had tried to keep up morale while the family were sick? God help me, if that were true I couldn’t help but imagine the poor man sat there with his loved ones close to death, desperately trying to encourage them to click their own pieces into place while they faded in and out of consciousness.\n\nSomething about that room emanated madness, and the longer I stayed down there flicking the bright disk of light of my torch from one detail to another, the more I wanted to leave. One door had wooden beams nailed across it. One sofa had been partially disassembled. Multiple beds had been burned. And all the light bulbs had been removed and put in a box on the kitchen counter top. Looking up at the ceiling, I finally had some insight into why the police were so confident the Vances had not survived despite never finding their bodies. Someone had jammed a human finger into one of the empty sockets, almost like they’d expected it to glow with the flick of a switch.\n\nWhat was it about this place that had caused the police to leave and never return? Not to even take that finger and test it for signs of illness, or even just to confirm who it belonged to?\n\nI decided it was time to hurry up and find my dog. People had died in that place, and while I’m not superstitious, I can’t be the only sceptic who has done the calculations in his head and realised it costs nothing to be respectful of ghosts. That bunker was cramped, terrifying, and the air stank so bad I started to worry I’d get sick myself. It served no one any good to linger. But I’d be damned if I’d just walk away and leave Ripley to rot down there. It’s not like he could climb a ladder and get out on his own (even if I wasn’t entirely sure how he’d gotten down there in the first place).\n\nSummoning what little bravery I had left I called out and broke the silence, something which felt like a terrible taboo in that God awful place, like screaming in a graveyard.\n\n“Ripley!” \n\nI waited and hoped to hell I’d hear the pitter patter of his paws, but for the longest of moments there was only the kind of silence that makes you wonder if someone or something in the darkness is holding its breath trying to look like just another patch of nothing. Biding its time until you finally turn around and show it your back…\n\nThe TV came on with a blurt of white noise that was so loud and so sudden I cried, threw my arms up, and nearly fell backwards onto a rolled-out sleeping bag that looked like it had spent a week in the sewer. By the time I realised what had caused the noise, I could already hear a tinny rendition of Daniel Vance’s voice.\n\n*…I realise the issue here. I need to emphasise just how little I understand anything that’s…*\n\nI frowned at the screen as I approached. It showed a greenish infrared view of the bunker with Daniel upfront, and the dinner table behind him. It was grainy and hard to see, but I could clearly tell that his family were sitting in those chairs. \n\n*…Miranda was first to fall ill. Looking back it makes perfect sense. Miranda often went into storage to fetch food for cooking and we found it behind one of the refrigerators. So that’s–ah shit..*\n\nOne of the figures in the background slumped onto the table with a loud *clank* and sent a plate spinning off onto the ground.\n\n*Shit shit shit*, Daniel muttered as he got up and grabbed the woman by the shoulders and sat her upright. *Miranda never did like my cooking!* He snorted a laugh as he fussed with something at the back of the chair. *The rods are much better than tape. All those hours spent taping them upright to the chairs. Never worked. But the rods… they fit right into the spine and with a little modification I can just slot them into the chairs. That way everyone is able to join in for dinner. I’m working on something similar for family game night.* \n\nDaniel wandered over to the camera and with a grin he lifted it from the tripod and scanned the dinner table. What I saw nearly made me drop my torch. \n\nHis family were long dead. Gaunt faces. Missing noses. Lips that had receded to reveal awful grins. These were corpses, plain as day, even when viewed through such a low resolution image. The only thing that made them seem remotely alive was the way their eyes still reflected the infrared back so that they glowed in the dark. And yet Daniel seemed oblivious to it all. He tousled Elliot’s hair. Kissed his wife on the cheek. Run a hand across one young girl’s shoulder. He even picked the young Alexander up from his high chair and I assume he coddled him. I don’t know for sure because I looked away, unwilling to see the poor boy up close.\n\nEyes averted from the screen, I couldn’t help but pan my torch across to that same dinner table and shiver as I finally realised what all those stains were. Not quite blood. But close. *Liquefying flesh.* Left alone for months, Daniel had not put his family’s bodies to rest. Instead he had moved them around from place to place and puppeted them, living life as if nothing had really changed. Looking at where those stains had settled I saw a clear pattern emerge. He had put them to bed. He had set them dinner. He had propped them up to watch TV, or gave them their favourite books. They even sat there as lifeless husks while Daniel waited for them complete a fucking jigsaw. The idea horrified me to my core.\n\n*…back to work. It’s obviously not part of the original designs. No room on the other side, not on the blueprints. Elliot didn’t believe me and why would he? I made every inch of this place, but I did not install that door in storage on the bottom level. I checked the cameras and some of the photos I took during the build and the wall is just blank. But the door is there now and it must lead somewhere. I don’t know when or why it opens, but it does and the next time I’ll be ready. Because I have to know what’s on the other side, and why it did this to us. Alone down here, often all asleep at once. Anything could have slit our throats and been done with it. But it didn’t. It took its time and I have to know why!* \n\n*It took our radios and computers and phones. One by one. None of us noticing until it was far too late. I kept telling the kids they needed to take better care of their things, and even as they complained I just assumed the phones were lying behind some shelf. Where else could they go in a locked bunker? But it wasn’t the children at all. Looking back there are so many signs… who kept taking away the lights? Who kept draining the batteries in our torches? How long did we live with it before we finally realised we weren’t alone? Was it here every step of the way?* \n\n*A door out of nothing that leads to nowhere, at least most of the time. Because I know for a fact it does not always open onto a blank wall. There is something behind it. I can hear it shuffling around in there, wet breath rattling in its lungs, a horrible sound I hear roaming these halls when it thinks I’m asleep…*\n\nI listened to Daniel, fascinated by this strangely compelling rant, when movement caught my eye. An infrared camera running in the dark, its image a roiling mess of uniform noise. What was it I’d seen? I paused the tape and rewound. Squinting, I saw two pinpricks of light in the darkness just over Daniel’s shoulder. Slowly, the image resolved itself in my mind. I knew what I was seeing and it turned my blood to ice.\n\nMiranda Vance had turned her head, and her lifeless eyes glowed as she fixed them on the back of Daniel’s head.\n\n*…not even any point leaving at this stage. I’m no doctor, but that door is giving off enough radiation to… well, to kill a family of seven. If none of us had touched it… Being in the same room is risky, but not lethal. But given how sick we’ve become, it’s pretty obvious our curiosity got the better of us, one by one, and we all got too close. Or maybe not. Maybe that thing on the other side came through and did this. I don’t even kn… wait… what was that?*\n\nDaniel turned and the camera stopped recording. The image it froze on was of a lone man, bright as a star in the camera’s lens, facing off against unknowable darkness broken only by six pairs of white, glowing eyes.\n\nI became painfully aware of my position relative to the table and I had the painful premonition that if I turned, those chairs would not be empty. I would see the Vances, all of them, Daniel as well, waiting for me. Heads turned. Bodies left to rot for years in the dark. Behind me something shifted. It breathed. Loud. Quick. I knew what it was. *I knew*. It came at me so fast that when I felt something hot and wet touch my hand I screamed, only for the presence to suddenly recoil. But then, without hesitation, it leapt at me and bore me to the ground.\n\nI wept as Ripley licked my face. He was shivering and, worst of all, silent which was not normal. He was not a quiet dog, not when greeting me and not when excited like he was now. But whatever he’d seen down here, he clung to me and dug his paws into my shoulders like he wanted to be cradled over the shoulder, something he has been too big to do for years. \n\n“Oh you fucking idiot,” I cooed in a soft whisper and even in the dark I could feel his tail wagging. Joking aside, I felt nothing but relief at finding him. “Let’s get the hell out of here.”\n\nI picked him up, straining a little under the weight but refusing to give into tired muscles, and made for the ladder. It wasn’t easy climbing the three or four rungs to the hatch, but I managed it and gave the hatch a shove. First one hand, then two. Again and again, with everything I had, but still that hatch refused to budge.\n\n“Shit!” I cried while pounding at it with my fists, but all I achieved was a sore wrist. The hatch had jammed when, somehow, the handle had been snapped clean off. Now I’d need a pair of pliers or something to cut through the metal bar locking it shut. My fingers couldn’t move it, nor could I brute force the hatch open. The metal bar was an inch thick and, at the very least, I’d need some tools to get at it from this side. \n\n*At least it’s fixable*, I thought as I climbed back down and caught my breath. On one wall I noticed a simple diagram of the bunker made in chalk. It had three floors. The bottom was storage–Daniel had mentioned that before, and I noticed that he had drawn through it with a large red X–and the top floor was labelled *Quarters*, where I stood now. But the middle floor was labelled workshops and it was there I realised that I’d find what I needed.\n\nThere was one door that opened onto a concrete stairwell and, standing at the top, I shone my light down the spiralling guard rails unsure of what it was I hoped to see. There were only harsh shadows and the sense of something foul rising up on the air. A smell that tickled my throat and burned a little in my lungs. Had the police even gone down this far? Had they seen what I’d seen on that TV and just left? Somehow I thought it was unlikely that had been enough to send the entire Sheriff’s department running, so was it something else that had done it. Something that had been enough to terrify dozens of armed men. Something that was almost definitely down there. \n\n*The door…*\n\nI went down quietly. At first I considered leaving Ripley behind, but after losing him the first time I decided I’d rather risk it just to know that he was right next to me. Besides, he was being quieter than I was, and I didn’t feel much like going down those stairs on my own. He accompanied me with only the quiet click clack of his paws on concrete, a sound I found deeply comforting as I barely managed to keep my torch from shaking in my hand and my breathing steady.\n\nDown one floor and I found the workshop exactly as you might expect. A large space filled with generators and fuel and water tanks and boilers and heaters and pretty much anything and everything that you’d need to survive but which you couldn’t put outside due to fallout. Wires pipes and tubes ran from one end of the room to the other and even years later, most of the machinery still hummed in the pitch black emptiness, an idea I found deeply unsettling. Taking one look at that strange tangle of harsh shapes and industrial figures looming out of the walls and floor, I shivered and looked around, quickly finding a small area Daniel had cordoned off for his own use. About a fifth of the total floor space, there was a large workbench and some seriously high end machining equipment, all very well used. Lathes. Buzzsaws. Drills. Belt sanders. Welding torches. Everything a man needed to do-it-himself.\n\nAnd Daniel had been busy.\n\nI’m not sure exactly what it was he’d been working, but there was an arm on the bench. It sat atop a pile of papers that had slowly turned brown over the years until the whole thing looked like it had been soaked in tobacco spit. On the whiteboard was a faded but still visible diagram of what looked to me like a ball-and-socket joint. I thought of the tape, of Daniel’s little mechanism to keep his family upright, and then looked at the arm and suppressed a momentary gag reflex. I don’t know if Dan had been working on posable limbs, or just a way to put the decomposing remains back together after they’d started to fall apart, but the size of the arm suggested a pre-teen child, and he’d left it out on the surface like it was a disassembled clock. It was also missing a finger. *Just how fucking crazy was he?* I wondered as I pinched my nose with one hand and began overturning boxes looking for a hefty pair of pliers, or maybe a hacksaw. Ripley backed away from the noise, but once I made sure he wasn’t going anywhere I carried on grabbing and pulling at box after box hoping I’d find what I was looking for. Anything to break that fucking metal bar.\n\nIn the end I managed to get a pair of bolt cutters, a crowbar, and a heavy duty pair of pliers. One went in my pocket, one went down the back of my jeans, and the other was clutched in my fist, too large to be tucked away in my clothes. The bolt cutters felt hefty in my hand which was a bit of comfort, but that feeling didn’t last long.\n\nSomething moved in the darkness, out there in the twisted jungle of shadows cast by all those pipes and wires that ran from one machine to the next. A figure moved. Thin, but unmistakably human in its outline. I couldn’t help but remember what I’d seen on that tape. Surely it couldn’t have been real? Maybe Daniel had rigged something up. Some fishing wire and a motor, maybe? The idea that those bodies had been moving on their own… I couldn’t be sure of that, could I? It was a frightening idea, one my mind had latched onto out of sheer panic. That was all…\n\nAnd then I saw them. A pair of white pin-pricks reflecting back at me from the depths of that cluttered room. Ripley, already behind me, head nuzzled into my leg, pushed even closer against me and let out a barely audible whine under his breath. The behaviour of a dog who was terrified, close to pissing himself with fear.\n\n*Just a bit of metal*, I told myself as the light shook so violently in my hand I struggled to see straight. *Just two shiny bits of metal…*\n\nThey blinked and began to come towards me. If I had any doubts left, they were dispersed by the sight of a pale white hand emerging into the light.\n\nI ran straight to the stairs and went to climb them, but only one or two steps in and I saw something gripping the handrail on the top floor. A mouldy clump of flesh only just recognisable as a fist, the flesh withered until the fingers were basically bone. Without meaning to, I brought my light up out of habit and I saw the bloated face of a hairless corpse glaring down at me. I couldn’t even tell you if it had been a teenage girl or the sixty-year-old Daniel, either way I instinctively turned and found another body shambling towards me out of the workshop. I was trapped. Nowhere to go. By the feel of warm fluid on the back of my leg I could tell Ripley had finally pissed himself. An adult dog, tail between his legs, shivering like a puppy and desperate to be picked up. God I needed him to just stay together for a little longer. I couldn’t take him in my arms, but I couldn’t leave him behind either…\n\nWith nowhere to go I ran down and entered storage. There was the temptation to stop once I hit the bottom. Down here the air was thicker and the sounds of my breathing were muted, somehow distant. But I only had to look back up to see three pairs of eyes glaring down at me, so without giving any of it much further thought I barreled down the corridor and stumbled onto a door at random. Opening it, I saw what looked like your standard storage room, only most of the shelves had been overturned and the food left to rot on the floor. One or two shelving units were still upright though, and their shelves were covered in tall opaque boxes that made them a fantastic hiding spot. That, I decided, would have to be where I crouched down and turned off my light.\n\nI was already inside when I realised that wasn’t all that was in there…\n\nThe door *almost* looked normal. I could see why Daniel must have been confused by it because it looked a little bit like all the other doors down there, but it was different too. It was too tall and too wide, about a foot and a half off the ground, and the metal rusted in its entirety like it had aged out of sync with everything else down there. All around the jamb was a profusion of wet soppy moss like the kind you find hanging off trees in a swamp, and every few seconds the door would leak something strange and oily, like the kind of thing you find in a parking lot on a rainy day. Of course that wasn’t too strange in itself, but the leak was horizontal, defying gravity so that every few seconds a large glob of the stuff would whip across the room and *slap* into the wall opposite creating a puddle about the size of a man that defied all reason.\n\nRemembering Daniel’s words about radiation, I instinctively inched away from this puddle and the door on the opposite wall, backing myself into the darkest quietest corner I could while I pulled Ripley behind me and hoped to hell he wouldn’t give me away. Once I was in there I turned off my light and waited.\n\nI must have taken longer than I’d thought to hide spot because it was barely two seconds later when a few figures entered the room. It was pitch black after I’d turned off my torch, but they made enough noise to let me know that at least two of them had stumbled in after me. I stayed there, unable to see anything, not sure if they were heading straight for me or just getting ready to leave, forced to hold out and let luck decide my fate. When I finally heard something scrape against the wall barely two feet from where I stood, I gave up and switched my light on, desperate to know what was coming for me.\n\nThe sound had been terribly misleading. \n\nDaniel Vance was no more than six inches from my face.\n\n“Get out,” he hissed from a toothless and cracked mouth. A living corpse just like the others, somehow a flash of intelligence remained in those wide, terrified eyes. \n\nAnd then I heard it. The creaking of a door. And without even thinking I turned the light and saw it on the wall. I saw *it* open, and behind the strange steel there was more than just plain old concrete. Much more. I saw a raging gullet of flesh. A ringed tube of pulsing muscle lined with teeth the size of hands. A spiralling descent into madness. Hot foetid air washed into the room, buffeting me and the rotting corpses, all of us paralysed by what we were seeing, even if for most of the figures beside Daniel and myself, they didn’t have eyes to see with.\n\n“What the fuck…?” I muttered, unable to take my eyes from the flesh tube beyond that doorway.\n\n“It’s coming,” Daniel whispered as he grabbed me with one fist and hurled me out of the room. I hit the floor and skidded along a slick fluid left by the Vance’s footprints, the smell of which turned my stomach. Perhaps the worst detail was that it was cold. I don’t know why, I’d just expected whatever oozed them off them to be feverishly hot. But it wasn’t. It soaked my shirt like I’d fallen into a muddy puddle.\n\n“It’s coming.”\n\nThis voice wasn’t Daniel’s. I couldn’t say for sure, but it sounded like a child’s whisper. One by one the bodies shuffled over to the open door and knelt before it. I don’t know why but I got the impression the others had lost pretty much everything left of their minds, but Daniel remained aware. He looked back at me once more and spoke before he pressed his head to the floor in supplication with the others.\n\n“The only thing we did wrong was being *here* for it to torture. It didn’t need a reason, just an opportunity. Leave. It won’t let us go. It won’t even let us die. And if it catches you, it won’t let *you* go either.”\n\nHis forehead kissed the dirt. \n\nAnd then something reached through the door and gripped his head in its palm the way you or I might pick up an apple.\n\nIn full panic, I ran over and grabbed my dog and the bolt cutters and I ran like my legs were pistons, machines whose signals of exhaustion and fatigue could not slow me down, or cause me to fall. I had to move. I had to leave. The hand that had grabbed Daniel… the sight of it flushed my mind clean like some kind of enema. It hurt to see the image replay in my mind but there was nothing else in my head echoing around except the sight of fingers with one too many knuckles, and nails as large as a smartphone.\n\nI reached the top floor and nearly collapsed from breathlessness, but I wouldn’t let myself stay down for long. I crawled over to the ladder and climbed up and immediately went to work trying to cut the metal lock. It was hell with just one hand, the other clinging to the torch that I kept frantically pointing at the door behind me, and it wasn’t long before I fumbled one too many times and dropped my only source of light.\n\n“No no no no…” I mewed. But there was no time to look for it. I had to get out and I had to get out fast! I couldn’t see but I was sure I could hear something climbing up those stairs. Not the steady *thump thump* of human feet. No this was different. This was a rapid pitter patter of a spider, maybe. Something with hundreds of feet or hands, or God knows what, skittering along the floor and walls and ceiling, pulling itself along with a body whose mere shape would offend God.\n\nUsing all my strength I leaned hard on the bolt cutters and, at last, the bolt gave. I threw the hatch open and got just enough ambient light to see Ripley hovering at the bottom of the ladder, growling ineffectually at the doorway. I crouched down, scooped him up, and fled up the ladder so quickly that my muscles turned to jelly at the top and I fell over onto hands and knees. But still, I was out. The long corridor covered in writing was ahead of me, and at the very end a doorway capped now by the tired blue light of a full moon.\n\nRipley needed no encouragement. He whipped down the corridor with canine speed and I followed at a broken and stumbling crawl, eventually shouldering past the open door and collapsing onto the forest floor.\n\nFor a few seconds I drifted in and out of consciousness, but when I looked up and saw the canopy overhead moving–the branches backlit by a full moon–I snapped awake and glared down at something gripping my ankle. The hand had reached out of the dark and seized me and was slowly dragging me back into the Earth below. Whatever it was, most of its body lurked out of sight in the shadows behind the doorway, but the hand that crushed my leg was the size of my torso with an arm that looked like it belonged to a mole rat.\n\nI struck it with my own fist. I dug my nails in. I cried and kicked and screamed, but nothing could stop it. From behind the door, something like a face grinned and leered at me with joy. It was taking its time, sure enough, pulling me in so slowly that it gave my mind all the time in the world to appreciate the nightmare that awaited me. I think if, in that moment, you’d given me a gun, I would’ve shot myself because God help me I couldn’t escape the look in Daniel’s eyes, how he’d knelt to worship this thing like a man who knew that hope or pride or joy or anything with even a hint of goodness to it was so far out of reach for him it might as well be a dream. How long was this thing going to keep them down there? How long did it intend to keep *me!?*\n\nI wept like a child, feeling like my mind was slowly cracking as I tried everything to stop that fucking pulling me into the shadows. I kicked at the earth. I dug into it using my hands looking for a root or a pipe or anything to hold onto. Nothing, *nothing*, I did would slow it down.\n\nI was no more than a foot from the doorway when Ripley reappeared.\n\nA dog afraid of hoovers and plastic bags and doors that move on their own. A dog who once got stared down by a particularly feisty rabbit who stopped mid chase and turned around, baffling the predator on its tail. A dog you couldn’t even watch scary movies around…\n\nAnd he lunged at that arm like he was a wolf, like he’d always been one. And while he didn’t quite break the skin, the pressure was enough to make the thing’s grip weaken and I slid my leg out. Unable to stand, I knelt and grabbed the dog and pulled as hard as I could and now that fucking thing bled at last as the pressure of the jaws and the sliding teeth ripped into its flesh. Together, at last, Ripley and I were let go and sent rolling backwards head over hells.\n\nI wasted no time waiting or looking or processing. I heaved the dog to my chest and crawled until I passed out, making it maybe half a kilometre away. Only when I could no longer see the door did I let myself fall to the ground face first and gave up consciousness.\n\n\\-\n\nThe doctors said I had pneumonia, which I suppose made some kind of sense. I might have even believed them were it not for the Sheriff’s visit, asking strange questions of me as I lay in bed about what I may or may not have seen. I dismissed them to the best of my ability. I wasn’t interested in chasing that particular nightmare down, figuring out if it had been real or not, at least not while I lay there half-drowning in my own infection. To be fair, I had at least some sympathy for why the police had done so little to seal that place off. I have, on occasion, thought about going and doing the job myself, but to this day I still have nightmares about being pulled into the dark beyond that door. Not just the bunker door, the one I narrowly avoided at the end, but the one *below*. What I saw was a kind of madness, I’m sure of it, and I often think of Daniel’s words. \n\n*It didn’t need a reason, just an opportunity*.\n\nSomehow, the Vances were that opportunity. Maybe they built their bunker on a leyline, or a weak spot between dimensions, or the site of former Satanic rituals. I’m not sure it even matters. They went into the dark thinking it’d be a safe place to wait out the world’s troubles, but something had been down there waiting for them, waiting for a chance to get at a family of seven people, to lock them in and deprive them of escape and slowly take from them everything it could.\n\nI’ve moved since then. Couldn’t help it. It wasn’t just the memories you see. It was the short-wave radio I kept in my basement. Something my father passed onto me when I was just a boy. God I’d forgotten about it… at least until I woke up one day to the sound of it blaring white noise down in the dark.\n\nAnd buried in that sound was the faint whispering of a man, his voice barely recognisable, but unmistakably *his*.\n\n*…let them go let them go let them go let them go let them go let them go…*"},"278":{"title":"When I was a kid, my dad kept a second family in our basement.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/it8166\/when_i_was_a_kid_my_dad_kept_a_second_family_in\/","flair":"Child Abuse","author":"hercreation","selftext":"Growing up, I thought everyone had a second family in their basement. In retrospect, I understand how ridiculous that sounds… but it was all I’d ever known.\n\nI knew that every night, my dad tented the leftovers from dinner with foil, got up without a word, and carried the plate to the basement. I’d listen from my room as he lumbered down the creaking steps, held my breath to hear the muffled mumblings of his greeting.\n\nI knew that every morning, he’d make the trip downstairs to see his second family off before work, then kiss me on the top of my head and ruffle my hair as he walked out.\n\nI knew that each Christmas, he’d bring a sack of brightly wrapped packages downstairs in a Santa suit.\n\nI knew that my dad had a second family in the basement, and it seemed so normal that I thought *everyone* else did too.\n\nI’ll never forget the first time I asked my mom about them. I was young – maybe five – when I finally found the words to ask: “Mommy, why can’t I play with the people in the basement?”\n\nMy mom was the human embodiment of frenetic energy, an organic perpetual motion machine. Always pacing, or cleaning, or stirring a pot. Always with a lit cigarette tucked between her yellowing fingers.\n\nI’ll never forget that, as that question hung in the air, she finally *stopped* for the first time. Her stillness was unsettling in a way I can’t quite explain.\n\n“We don’t talk about them,” she rushed, chasing the hurried statement with a lengthy drag off her cigarette. She blew a plume of smoke out the opened window before leaning down to meet me at face level, her bloodshot eyes mere inches from my own. “You don’t need to play with the kids, but the kids need Daddy.”\n\nShe paused again, the haunting image of her at a standstill etching itself into my mind permanently. Finally, she muttered, “Daddy needs them too.”\n\nThat night, I heard my mom shrieking at my dad in their bedroom. I was surprised that they didn’t know that I knew, more shocked – frightened, even – to find that they didn’t *want* me to know. Most of all, they didn’t want me to tell anyone at school – anyone at all, really.\n\nAfter that night, everything was different. My dad only tented the leftovers after dinner, only brought the food downstairs after I’d gone to bed. He stopped visiting them in the mornings altogether. My mom started acting differently, too. I’d always noticed that she was… distant from my dad; had always noticed how she bristled under his touch, how she stole away to the other side of the room whenever he entered. But it got worse after that… as a kid, I felt deeply guilty. I felt like I’d ruined my parents’ marriage.\n\nBut I was just a kid, and I was curious. My mom meant to dissuade me from asking more questions, but she accidentally gave away something that made me even *more* curious – the downstairs family had kids, maybe kids my own age to play with.\n\nI wanted – *needed* to know about them, in the way that little kids *need* to understand all of the strangeness of this chaotic world, *need* to make sense of the nonsense that surrounds us daily. The nonsense that we become acclimated to as adults but struggle with endlessly as children, like a puzzle or a riddle or a word problem on a math test about buying eighty watermelons.\n\nAnother change following that critical night: the basement door was fitted with sturdy lock. Even still, I needed to know… there’s something horribly dreadful about finding out that a second basement family is abnormal, something more horrible still about not knowing who or *why.* By the time I was seven, I made up my mind to get to the bottom of it.\n\nTo avoid getting in trouble, I could only investigate when three conditions were met: I was home from school, my dad was still at work, and my mom wasn’t around to catch me. These circumstances rarely overlapped, but the first time I came home from school to find that my dad’s car wasn’t in the garage and my mom’s endless movement had driven her to the point of exhaustion, I threw off my shoes and crept to the basement door, quiet in my sock feet.\n\nAnd then, I knocked.\n\nIt was a quiet knock, for fear of waking my mom from her nap, but it was a knock, nonetheless. It was more than just a knock, too, it was an initiation, an invitation, a confrontation of my life’s greatest – and most terrifying – mystery.\n\nI jumped when a gentle knock returned from the other side. It was almost immediate… like the person on the other side had been *waiting* for me. The thought froze me in place for a moment, but I knew I didn’t any have time to waste.\n\nMy mouth felt suddenly of sandpaper and chalk, but I leaned into the door to whisper, “hi.”\n\n“Hi.”\n\nIt was a little girl, her voice sweet yet timid. Like testing the keys on a piano for the first time.\n\n“I-I’m Ricky. What’s your name?”\n\nA long pause.\n\n“Lila. My brother’s is Isaac, but he doesn’t talk so good. But he’s still little. Mommy says he’ll start talking when he’s ready.”\n\n“There’s three of you down there?”\n\n“Mhmm,” she replied simply, as if the entire situation felt as wholly normal for her as it had for me, on the opposite side of the basement door. “Daddy comes to visit sometimes, though, so I guess there’s four.”\n\nMy eyes widened as a flurry of questions began to sprout in my mind, but I heard my mom start to stir in her room. I sped down the hallway and into the playroom. I busied my hands with my toys, but my mind was somewhere else… the sprouts of questions continued to grow rapidly, soon overtaking my thoughts like an unruly patch of weeds.\n\nAnd like weeds, the questions were stubborn; hard to – *impossible* to get rid of. The roots of the situation and its implication unraveled, stretched through my whole body. Fear planted itself firmly in my belly as I was forced to confront the possibility that I didn’t really know my dad, didn’t really know my own family at all. If my dad was Lila’s dad, too, what did that mean for me? For my family?\n\nAnd why wasn’t she allowed to come out of the basement?\n\nOver the next couple years, I stole away to the basement door in those rare moments of freedom. I got to know Lila, got to like her and eventually even to love her – she was my best friend. As a kid, I was pretty lonely; my classmates shied away from me for reasons I couldn’t quite understand, like something about me was inherently repellant to my peers. I only had one friend at school.\n\nAnd at home, I had Lila.\n\nAs we spoke more, a never-ending stream of back and forth questioning crammed into the briefest moments of time, we both came to understand the differences between us, between our lives and our circumstances. The differences that at first felt so *normal* grew bigger and sharper and scarier than either of us could comprehend.\n\nThe unfairness of it all became impossible to ignore.\n\nLila lamented that she wasn’t allowed to go to school, that she couldn’t go outside to play or make friends or ride bikes around the cul-de-sac in the summer until the streetlamps flickered on and the cicadas started to scream. She even longed for the things I loathed most– homework, rinsing off my dishes after dinner, tidying up my room each Sunday morning.\n\nShe said she’d lived in that basement all of her life, was probably even *born* down there. She couldn’t remember anything different before being locked up in the cold and musty room.\n\nI’m ashamed to admit this, but, eventually… I couldn’t manage the guilt I felt for living the life Lila never had, *could* never have in my mind. I was so young, so naïve… I didn’t know how to manage the situation anymore, so I did the only thing I could think of.\n\nI stopped trying.\n\nI stopped visiting Lila. No more secret, whispered exchanges; no more quick knocks on the door just to let her know that I was there, that anyone at all was there for her. Days and weeks and months and years trickled by with Lila never quite leaving my thoughts, but with her existence instead… *compartmentalized*.\n\nConfined to the basement of my own mind.\n\nAt home, it was harder to keep thoughts of her locked away. When my dad brought her dinner hours past my bedtime, I’d lay awake warm in my bed. Sometimes I’d hear her scream. Sometimes I’d hear the tray clatter to the floor, the plate fracturing on impact. Sometimes I’d hear her crying – awful, painful sobs – while I assembled new Lego sets in the playroom.\n\nSometimes she… she would call out my name. I’ll never forgive myself for this – I hate myself for it, and I *deserve* to – but I ignored her every time.\n\nWorst of all, though, was when she started knocking.\n\nI was finishing up my science homework for the day when the first knock came.\n\nA quiet knock… but a knock, nonetheless. An initiation, an invitation, a *confrontation*.\n\nMy blood ran cold as I realized where it was coming from; *who* it was coming from.\n\nI hopped on my bike and didn’t come home until dinner was on the table.\n\nThat night, I heard my dad scream back at Lila for the first time. Yelled for her to *knock it off* with all the knocking. He took care of her, of her little brother and her mom, and that he could only do that if she stayed in the basement, if she stayed quiet.\n\nShe wasn’t persuaded, though, and her knocking only grew more frequent, and *louder*. I was about ten years old by then, so I had a little more freedom… all the freedom in the world, compared to Lila. I avoided my house at all costs, only returning in the evenings, where I’d be greeted immediately by the knocking.\n\nBy then, it was less knocking and more ramming the total weight of her body into the door. My mother took to vacuuming the house obsessively just to cover up the noise. She wouldn’t even look my dad in the eye anymore. I imagined the bruises blooming on Lila’s shoulder, up and down the length of her arm. If it hurt her, she didn’t let on.\n\nShe didn’t stop.\n\nSleep became a distant memory, leaving me dazed and irritable and confused and – most of all – terrified. I began showing up at my schoolfriend’s – now my *only* friend’s – house unannounced just to escape Lila’s knocking.\n\nHis parents clearly didn’t like me, and tensions rose between the two of us kids, escalating to a boiling point that ended in a fight. I slugged him in the gut, and he returned with the words that broke me – broke *everything*.\n\nA blow far more powerful than he could’ve delivered with small hands balled up into fists.\n\n“My mom says you’re a *bastard*, that your mom’s a *whore!*”\n\nI had to look up the words in my dictionary when I got home.\n\nI had to gather the courage to, once again, ask a difficult question: “Mom… am I a bastard?”\n\nI had to watch my mom lose her momentum, to *stop* again.\n\nI had to watch what little light she had left in her go out.\n\nI had to sit there as she left the room, had to sit there spilling hot tears as the knocking kicked up again, each powerful thrust against the door wracking my mind, a painful reminder that Lila was coming for me.\n\nBut, my mom came back, and she returned with an old newspaper clipping in her hands, worn at the edges. She held it to her chest as she finally – *finally* – told me the truth about Lila, about Dad’s second family in the basement.\n\nI was young, but I needed to know. My mom knew it, too.\n\nThrough choking sobs, she told me about my dad’s old family, the one he’d had and *made* before he met her. The horrible mistake they’d made, the one that gave her the best thing she’d ever had in her life but took away three others. About how my dad’s old wife was already skating on thin ice, her cries for help that went unanswered, how when she found out about what my mom and my dad were doing that what little was left beneath her shattered.\n\nAbout how they couldn’t have known, but about the guilt she carried regardless – “like a heavy backpack, mom?”\n\n“Yes, sweetie. But I can never put it down.”\n\nThat Lila was dead; and Isaac, too. That their mom had done *that* to them, and then did it to herself too. My dad found them in the basement when he got home from work. That he’d never forgiven himself, and my mom never had either. That when they reappeared back in the basement like nothing had happened, even after their bodies were taken and buried all those years ago, they couldn’t think of anything to do but to give them as normal of a life as possible.\n\nYet another difficult question: “but… why do they have to stay in the basement?”\n\nI found out later that evening, when my dad came home from work and unlocked the door. Lila came out of the shadows, and I flinched instinctively as I saw her face for the first time, saw the gaping hole in her face where her left eye should have been. Isaac was little like Lila said, but the oozing wound to his jaw would have made it nearly impossible for him to speak if he had the chance to grow up.\n\nI was scared at first, but I put on my brave face and took Lila by the hand. I played with Lila and Isaac for the first time; shared my toys with them, laughed with them. I didn’t meet their mom that day, but I would, years later. Once she and Lila and Isaac knew what became of them, she struggled to cope. She doesn’t come out often, but I treat her with kindness when she does. The woman I know her as now couldn’t imagine doing what she did.\n\nMy dad’s second family still stayed inside, but they were no longer confined to the shadows of the basement after that day. They became less of my dad’s *second* family as we all became one larger family that laughed and played and loved together.\n\nI don’t live in that house anymore… I’m an adult now, with an enormous appreciation for all of the freedom and opportunities available to me that I once took for granted. I know my family is far from normal – even horrible and horrifying in many ways that I helped to perpetuate as a kid – but it’s all I’ve ever known. I love them… all of them.\n\nI still visit whenever I can, for birthdays and for Christmas and for summer vacations. And whenever I do visit, I take a moment to be grateful for the fact that when I knock on the front door, [Lila opens it](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/hercreation\/).\n\n[X](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/thecrypticcompendium\/)"},"279":{"title":"The homeless in my neighborhood don't just want change","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/vzyocc\/the_homeless_in_my_neighborhood_dont_just_want\/","flair":null,"author":"MrFrontenac","selftext":" Two whole years ago my wife Angie and I decided it was finally time to buy a house. We knew it was anything but a buyer’s market, but we were sick of paying triple what a mortgage would be in rent every month.\n\nI’m sure this story is familiar to some of you and we went through every stage of disbelief, anger and finally apathy after every competitive offer we put together was blown out of the water by a multinational investment corporation. \n\nI’m not mad about the process anymore although it left me questioning where society was headed. \n\nHOW IS THIS LEGAL!! I WENT TO SCHOOL. I PAID OFF DEBT. I GOT A GOOD JOB. I DID EVERYTHING RIGHT TO STILL GET PRICED OUT THE FUCKING CITY I GREW UP IN!!! \n\nPerhaps some anger remains. But after setting our sights on the city’s less desirable neighborhoods we finally got our home. \n\nOn June 1st we moved into a 4,500 square foot colonial. \n\nIt had hardwood floors that patinated like leather and the frosted plaster trim gave the ceilings the look of a wedding cake. The basement was a different story. It wasn’t just unfinished; it was a dank hole in the ground and scribbled on the walls were strange spirals and crude faces.\n\n“Kids.” The realtor had said like she knew who drew the markings. “Fixing up the basement would be quite the value builder!” \n\nSo, sure, the kitchen had composite counters and the basement needed a sign above the entrance that read, “Abandon all hope ye who enter here” but we had a home. And a damn big one at that.\n\nThe catch was that it was a stone’s throw from the freeway and that the area was known for its crime more than anything else. Angie said it was just a steppingstone, we’d bank a year’s worth of mortgage, hope the housing market keeps rocketing and move again in a year. \n\nThere were some flaws in her plan, mainly money, but I didn’t say anything. I figured we’d both adjust to like it there. \n\nThe first few weeks went smooth and me and the wife got to unpacking and introducing ourselves to the neighbors. Maybe it was the threat of crime and that there was comfort and purpose in knowing who you lived next to, but whatever it was our neighbors were incredibly friendly. \n\nWe felt at home quick and while there were some shocks, we made games out of them to take the fear away. \n\nWith the pops that permeated the night we had the game where we guessed whether the sound was fireworks or gunshots. When we passed large turds one of us would point and we played \n\nhuman or dog. \n\nUnfortunately, after just a couple weeks at this game we became experts at differentiating between these. Gunshots carry the sharp crack of the sound barrier being broken while fireworks go boom or pop. As for the poop let’s just say that we hadn’t seen any dogs large enough to lay landmines around town.\n\nThere was a homeless problem there for sure, but they minded their own business. Our neighbors seemed to see right through them. They’d act as if they were ghosts. Like they weren’t even there. Hell, everyone did. \n\nI’d smile and say hello in passing. The least I could do was treat them like human beings.\n\nOne night after a movie I was at the sink washing the popcorn bowl. The window above looks out to our backyard which was heavily wooded for a city lot. When it was dark out, I could only see a sliver of what was outside beyond the reflection of myself in the glass. \n\nI frowned at the shadow of a tall dark stump. I don’t remember a tree there. I swayed on my feet to see past my reflection. \n\nIn between the bushes, nearly out of sight, a man was standing still, staring back at me. My heart leaped and I dropped the bowl where it crashed in the sink. \n\n“You okay in there, honey?” Angie shouted from the living room. \n\n“Yeah.” I kept my eyes on the man and said nothing to Angie not wanting to alarm her. “I’m gonna take the trash out.”\n\n“Ok.” \n\nI walked by the trash without touching it and opened the back door. \n\n“Hello?” Outside the wind was blowing hard and the branches of the buckthorn the man stood behind were waving wildly as if to warn me.  \n\n“What do you want?” I stepped forward to try and show I wasn’t scared but it was the tepid step of prey like I was better planting my weight to run.\n\nThe man said nothing.\n\nI took another step forward more confidently this time but jumped when my movement activated the motion light. \n\nI composed myself and yelled. “This is private property! If you don’t leave I’m calling the police!” \n\nNow this was the emptiest of threats and everybody in the neighborhood knew it. The cops made a point to show up an hour late if at all. \n\nThe man walked forward a few paces to where I could see him better. He was very tall and wore a heavy wool overcoat that stretched all the way to his ankles.  \n\nHe kept walking towards me, my brain was shouting but I froze in fear.\n\n“What do you want?”\n\nHe stopped just in front of me. A white scar starred across his black skin just below the chin. He was at least six-foot-six but the coat that ran the entire length of his body made him gigantic. His face was recently shaven and gaunt.\n\nHe held out his fist at arm’s length and when he uncurled his fingers, cupped in his enormous palm was a pill.\n\n“I don’t have any drugs.” I said.\n\nHis face didn’t change any. There was no want or question in his eyes. \n\n“You want me to take it?” I pointed at his hand but still his expression was static.\n\nI reached out and gently plucked the pill from his palm. I held it between my forefinger and thumb. It was just a pill capsule, whatever had been inside had been emptied.\n\n“What do you want?” I asked again.\n\nHe opened his mouth revealing the severed stump of a tongue and then he widened the enormous whites of his eyes. He began to mouth something but being tongueless I couldn’t tell what. But my blood cooled because I felt certain it was some kind of curse.\n\n“Please,” I murmured. “Please leave.”\n\nHe turned and stepped into the night and I watched the bushes sway in his wake as if he were a giant parting his way through the woods. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe next day was Saturday and I was determined to find out if anyone knew about this tall man. I walked to the strip mall and asked some of the homeless in the area, but as soon as I began to describe him, they all looked at the ground and shook their heads. \n\nThe pattern was repeated with every other homeless person I tried to talk to. On my way home, I stopped by two men working on a car at the end of a driveway.\n\n“Hey,” I started over to them. “This may sound a little crazy, but do you know of a tall fella around here that wears a giant coat?” They both started laughing. “Sorry to waste your time.” I turned to go.\n\n“No, no.” One of them was waving me back. “You talking about a really big motherfucker?” The man raised his hand to signify. “Yay high? Black coat? Nasty scars?”\n\n“Yeah.” I nodded.\n\n“Well, that’s Tall Frank. What you wanna about him? You see him in your recycling?”\n\n“No, why?”\n\n“Tall Frank’s a can man. He makes his living that way.”\n\nI nodded. “He was acting weird in my backyard last night.”\n\n“Weird how? Was he just looking like his weird self ?”\n\n“No. He was staring at me from outside. When I went out he tried to say something. Or mouth something.”\n\nBoth of their brows rose. “You saying that Tall Frank tried to communicate with you?”\n\n“Yeah.” \n\nThey both looked at each other. “Tall Frank talks to nobody. And by talks I mean… communicating in any kinda way.”\n\n“He cut his own throat to never talk again.” The other chimed in. \n\n“That’s just a rumor. Tall Frank showed up in this neighborhood twenty years ago. No one knows where he came from and the man can’t tell ya. Yeah, people put all kinds of legend to those scars. Some say it was dog that bit him. But I never seen no dog that’ll slice your tongue out.”\n\n“If he doesn’t communicate with anyone how come he has the name Tall Frank?”\n\n“Hmm. Well that’s what my mama would call him.” He leaned closer to me. “She used to tell me to watch my tongue or Tall Frank’ll take it!” He chuckled to himself.\n\n“What do you think he wanted with me?”\n\nThey both shrugged. “No clue. But you be sure to tell us when you find out.” \n\nThey bent back to their work and I thanked them and went on far less assured than when I’d first set out.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe next several days there was no sign of Tall Frank, but I began to fall ill. It was a headache at first, but soon I had heart palpitations and body aches that I almost let take me to the emergency room. \n\nI assured myself that there was no such thing as curses. Why was I letting one strange encounter with a homeless man dominate my every thought? Angie was working late recently and when I had the house to myself at night, I would stand at the kitchen window and stare into the backyard. \n\nI was obsessed and it wasn’t long before I saw him again. I was wrapped in a blanket filling the teapot at the sink when I saw him standing in the same place as before.\n\nI dropped the pot and ran to the back door. \n\n“Hey!” My head felt light and I was in that same kind of drunken state where your fear hardly speaks to you. I scampered through the backyard over to him. “What do you want with me?”\n\nTall Frank was staring at me. He gestured with his scarred neck for me to follow. \n\nI looked down at my bare feet, but he was already walking. \n\n“Hey! Just leave us alone!” \n\nI stepped cautiously after him. When I got past the bushes where I could see the alley I saw him standing near the trashcans.\n\nI ran after him. “You! I don’t ever want to see you back here again!” With our difference in size and the blanket wrapped around my shoulders I’m sure I looked to him like some angry hobbit. \n\nHe certainly didn’t act intimated and I can’t blame him. Tall Frank crossed the alley and sat on a crumbling retaining wall. He gently tapped the stone next to him for me to sit. \n\n“I’m not fucking sitting.”\n\nHe reached into his breast pocket and paused before pulling out an envelope. Then he put the letter in his other hand and reached in again and pulled out another. \n\n“What are those?”\n\nHe extended the envelopes to me, his long arm nearly stretched the entire alley. I approached the letters cautiously snatching them and stepping back. \n\n“What are these?” I muttered already distracted. They had both been opened and I took the papers out of one of the envelopes.\n\nIt was a handwritten letter on college ruled paper. All the ink was smeared like it’d been dunked in water, but I could still read it albeit slowly. When I was done reading, I let my arm fall down to my side and stared at Tall Frank in disbelief. \n\nAngie had a lover. \n\nI looked at the other envelope and hardly had to read it to figure it out.\n\nThe letterhead read: Atlantic Life Insurance. \n\nA policy had been opened in my name for a quarter of a million dollars. \n\nI stumbled over to the retaining wall and sat. \n\n“The pills.” I thought about the empty capsule he’d shown me that I tossed aside. It was my emergency Albuterol. It had to be. A quick WebMD search showed that an overdose started with symptoms of headaches and heart palpations. \n\n“Angie is trying to kill me?”\n\nSuddenly I realized Tall Frank’s arm was around me and he was patting my shoulder paternally. \n\nWe sat there in silence for a long time. \n\n“The things you can learn from people’s recycling.” I said.\n\nTall Frank nodded and we watched the upstairs light turn on and my wife appeared in the window. She twisted something in her fingers and then tapped it into a mug.\n\nA minute later I heard the back door open. \n\n“Honey are you out here?” Angie called. “I made you some tea!”\n\nI guess the homeless around her don’t always want change.

I’ve seen a lot of upsetting and even unexplainable things in my time, but those pale in comparison to what I saw recently. Water search and rescue is often a depressing job. When someone gets lost in a forest, they can still be found alive days later. But when we get a call, it’s almost always body recovery. People don’t last long in the water.\n\nI can’t tell you exactly where, but I live in a northern territory known for its water sports. Fishing, kayaking, diving - whatever it is, our waters probably have a solid reputation for it. Despite that, this area isn’t some kind of resort. The waters here are cold and oftentimes vicious. Search and rescue operations here can be grueling and not many stick with it. There are a few older guys who have been doing it longer than me, but I’m one of the most experienced around.\n\nLike I said before, this job is more body recovery than anything, especially here. We save more live moose from the water than live humans. And when we get a call about a missing child…well we’d be better off just giving our condolences. That’s just how the waters are here. Our small town has one of the highest drowning rates in the country. But we look anyway, and usually we find a body.\n\nI’ve considered quitting many times in my career. Most people quit after their first recovery. In training, we try to emphasize just how much water can distort a corpse, but nothing can prepare you for the harsh reality. It’s not uncommon for us to find bodies bloated beyond recognition. Sometimes they barely even seem human. A lot of divers don’t last long after seeing something like that. But I continued to do it after all these years. I figured if I didn’t then no one would.\n\nHowever, the things I saw last week have made me reconsider that decision.\n\nI got the call around 11 A.M. A father had taken his ten-year-old son fly fishing. At one point, the father managed to stab a hook all the way through his finger. He went back up to his truck to get a first-aid kit. The boy was gone when he returned a few minutes later.\n\nWhen I first heard the story, I hung my head in silence for a moment. It had been raining heavily for almost a month now, and the waters were running faster than ever. To make things worse, it was unusually cold for the season. A number of people had gone missing in recent weeks. Many of them had yet to be found. I had little hope of finding the boy alive.\n\nMe and a couple of other divers were at the site where the boy went missing within an hour, and a larger search and rescue team located a few towns over was headed our way. We talked with the father and even searched the forest for a bit, hoping that he had just wandered off. But eventually we realized that we would have to begin searching in the river.\n\nThe moment I got in the water I knew the boy was gone. The current was worse than it had ever been, and even I had difficulty navigating the icy river. We looked for hours in the surrounding areas, and even expanded our search once the larger team had arrived. The boy was nowhere to be found.\n\nI was surprised. I hadn’t expected to find him alive, but I had at least anticipated finding a body. However, there was no trace of him. The sun got low and the air grew colder. We were considering calling it off as nightfall approached and resuming the search the next day when I discovered something.\n\nThere’s a lot of creek beds around the river. Many of them have dried up as a result of encroaching vegetation or manmade efforts to divert the water. We usually don’t pay any attention to them. However, with all of the recent rain, I noticed that one of the larger creek beds had begun flowing again. A surprising amount of water crashed through it, easily enough to carry a young boy.\n\nThe creek ran directly across a bend in the river, connecting it at two points. I followed it and realized that the boy could be located outside of our initial search area. As I approached where the creek reconnected with the main river, I felt a sinking feeling in my gut.\n\nThere’s a place in the river where not even search and rescue divers are supposed to go. It’s known as Badwater. This area lies on one half of the river and runs for about 100 yards. It’s near a densely vegetated area, so we don’t often have to worry about people swimming there. But a lot of disappearances occur in the surrounding waters. Despite that, I’ve been warned not to dive there since I began doing search and rescue. Supposedly the undercurrent is so strong that even the most experienced swimmer would be swept away in an instant. “Don’t go near Badwater.” It was a mantra of the older divers.\n\nThe creek ended exactly in the center of the Badwater region. As I reached it, I stopped and chewed my lip thoughtfully. If I went back and reported this to the other divers, they would tell me to let it go. They wouldn’t let me dive there. But deep down I felt like the boy’s body must be tangled up in some weeds nearby. If only I could find it. I hated the idea of that kid being stuck down there, slowly bloating and rotting away while his parents sat at home wondering where their boy had gone.\n\nBadwater didn’t seem to be that bad. I’d seen rougher waters before, but I knew looks could be deceiving. Just below the surface it could be flowing faster than I ever imagined. And I’d be swept away in an instant. Besides, I wasn’t supposed to dive alone. I almost turned back, but something made me stay. I stared into the river for a moment, thinking about the boy. Then I put on my gear and dropped into the icy waters.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was that the current actually seemed pretty weak. As a matter of fact, it was weaker than the rest of the river. The water was extremely deep there, and I could see only blackness below as I dove. I kicked deeper and deeper, thinking that the current might pick up lower down, but the opposite seemed to be true. The water was almost completely still.\n\nI went even deeper until finally green shapes began to materialize in front of me. I thought I’d finally reached a bed of weeds. But, as I kicked lower, the truth came into full view. I felt vomit come up at the sight, an odd and dangerous sensation when you’re wearing a scuba mask.\n\nCountless arms stuck up from the ground below. I thought I had come upon a trove of bodies, but the disgusting reality became even more apparent only a moment later. The arms grew directly into the ground. They even had roots that spread out from the base. It was as if someone had cut off hundreds of arms at the shoulder and planted them there. They were green, and I watched as they clutched at the water around them. They varied in size and seemingly age. Grotesque baby hands sprouted near the bottom, and they opened and closed their fists hungrily.\n\nIt was then that I saw the boy. His eyes stared sightlessly ahead as those grotesque arms pulled his dead body downward. It seemed they had just gotten ahold of him. The arms yanked at him, burying him in the surrounding sediment. They pushed and writhed and squirmed until he was securely buried up to the chest. I stared in mesmerized horror.\n\nThat was when the other bodies came into focus. There must have been at least four more, all in varying stages of decay. Some were bloated beyond recognition, only bulky, white masses that protruded loosely from the riverbed. I once again felt vomit rising in my throat and swallowed it back down. The fucking hands were feeding off the bodies, using them as fertilizer.\n\nThe moment I clambered out of the water I tore my mask off and retched. I couldn’t stop thinking about those disgusting bodies, those grasping hands. They were like some sort of carnivorous plant, yet they were so humanoid. I vomited again at the thought.\n\nI frantically ran back to our base camp and pulled one of the other divers aside. Moose was the most experienced person on our team. He’d been diving for over twenty years ever since moving here. I told him about what I saw. When I  finished, he stared at me in cold silence.\n\n“I told you never to go near Badwater.” His voice contained an iciness that even his thick Louisiana accent couldn’t conceal.\n\n“That’s what you’re concerned about?” I was incredulous.\n\nHe placed a hand on my shoulder and squeezed tightly. “Don’t tell anyone else about this. If the others find out you went into Badwater…” He trailed off and thought for a moment. “Well, it won’t be good.” He shook his head like a disappointed father.\n\n“But what about those things?” I tried to keep my voice down, hoping no one would hear us. “How many people have died because of those fucking things?”\n\n“Shut up.” Moose said. “We have an agreement. There’s a reason they only grow in Badwater. Don’t fuck this up.”\n\nI started to say something, but the words caught in my throat. He was keeping something from me.\n\nHe sighed and I saw something like sadness behind his eyes. “Sometimes you have to decide between lesser and greater evils. Even the best possible decisions can still keep you up at night.” He went silent for a moment and only stared at me. “Don’t tell anyone about this. Maybe one day you’ll understand.”\n\nHe walked away after that and called off the day’s search. Despite what I’d told him, we continued to search for the next two days. By the third day we called it off completely and gave our condolences to the family.\n\nI don’t know what the fuck is happening. Moose has been acting different towards me ever since. There’s an iciness to him, but every now and then he’ll shoot me a knowing glance, like we’re in on some secret together. I’ve noticed the other older divers acting strangely too. What did he mean by agreement? What the fuck were those arm things? I’m considering quitting and moving away from here. I can’t live with the knowledge that those things are down there, slowly feeding off the body of a young boy among countless [others](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/travisliebert).\n\n[Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/dmg9c8\/ive_been_a_search_and_rescue_diver_for_12_years\/)"},"281":{"title":"A Talking Crow Taught me to Fly","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/8qs8jv\/a_talking_crow_taught_me_to_fly\/","flair":null,"author":"lifeisstrangemetoo","selftext":"I used to look out the rusted iron bars of my window and dream about being a bird.\n\nThe chain that shackled me to my bed was just long enough to reach the windowsill, and so every night after my father would visit my room I would lie awake and wait for the first rays of light to creep over the horizon, then walk over to my window to listen to the morning’s first few notes of birdsong.\n\nTheir melodies were so beautiful, I knew that they must have been singing about places far away and wonderful, about sailing on the wind through endless blue skies, looking down at the treetops that dotted the land below.\n\nThen, one morning as I lay in bed, something impossible happened. I had fallen asleep the night before, and would have missed my morning birdsong but for a tapping on my window. I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes and sat up to see a crow sitting outside on the sill, tapping my window with his beak.\n\nI crept over to the window and smiled at the bird.\n\n“Hello, Mr. Crow,” I said.\n\n“Hello little girl,” said the crow.\n\nI stood there dumbfounded for a moment, not knowing what to say. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, I forced myself to speak.\n\n“You know how to talk?” I said.\n\n“All birds know how to talk,” he replied. “It’s just that not all humans know how to listen.”\n\nI pushed my window open a crack until it hit against the bars. The bird cocked its head in curiosity.\n\n“Why are you in a cage?” it asked.\n\n“I think it’s my destiny,” I said. “It’s always been this way.”\n\n“You look rather thin,” replied the crow. “Would you like something to eat?”\n\nMy stomach gave a weak growl.\n\n“Yes,” I said. “That would be wonderful.”\n\nWithout another word the crow took flight. A few minutes later he returned with a small branch of figs. The crow watched me as I greedily devoured the fruit. After I had finished he stared at me for a moment before speaking again.\n\n“I didn’t know they put people in cages,” he said. “Do you think they mistook you for a bird?”\n\n“I don’t think so Mr. Crow,” I said.\n\nWe whiled away the rest of that day talking. The crow told me all about what it was like to fly, how there was no better feeling in the world. He told me about the far away lands he had visited when he was a young bird and could still make the journey north with the changing of the seasons. Finally, evening came and the crow said that he had to go. The next morning he was back, however, with two more branches of figs.\n\nI thanked him for his generosity, and we talked another day away. That day he even sang me a song. He didn’t have a voice for singing, but I thought his song was beautiful anyway.\n\nWe passed the entire fall that way, and the bird’s visits became the only bright spot in my life. He brought me not only figs, but cherries and walnuts too\\-\\-anything small enough for him to carry.\n\nSoon, however, winter came, and with it the frosts that destroyed the figs and cherries that the crow had used to bring me. His gifts became fewer and fewer, and I could tell from his tired voice that he was flying farther and farther away to get them.\n\nOne morning, when the first snows of winter had fallen, the crow asked me a question.\n\n“What would you do to leave this place?” he asked, cocking his head to the side.\n\nI thought for a moment, but I wasn’t sure how to answer. Finally, I told the truth.\n\n“I would do anything to leave this place,” I said. “Anything at all.”\n\nThe crow solemnly nodded and said, “The frost isn’t the only thing that winter brings.”\n\nHe flapped his wings once and jumped from the windowsill, and I didn’t see him for three days. I began to fall into a deep depression. Every morning I would still listen to the birdsong, but it sounded forlorn and empty without my friend there to listen with me.\n\nThe morning after the third day my crow friend returned. It was so beautiful that day; the sun had come out from behind the clouds to melt the snow\\-\\-one of the last green days before winter came in earnest. As the shadow passed over the valley in which we lived, I first mistook it for a storm cloud, but then I heard the sound. It was loud enough to crack the sky, but it wasn’t thunder\\-\\-it was birds.\n\nThousands upon thousands of them descended on our house. A whirling storm of beating wings and shrieking caws, they crashed into the walls and windows, pecking at them with wild ferocity. The house shook under their assault, and their calls were so loud that I didn’t even hear the windows breaking.\n\nThey were not so loud, however, that I could not hear my father scream. It was over in a matter of minutes, and the key to my shackles slipped under the door. I rushed over and picked it up with trembling hands, sliding it into the metal cuff around my ankle and turning it.\n\nThe cuff came loose with a heavy click, and for the first time I was free.\n\nThe key to the door slipped under the jamb as well, and I opened the door to the rest of the house. The place had been all but destroyed. There was splintered wood and broken glass everywhere, and in the center of the living room was what remained of my father\\-\\-a pile of bloodstained feathers.\n\nThe birds had all flown off, but Mr. Crow sat on top of the living room fireplace, regarding me with a curious look.\n\n“Now you can fly free, little girl,” he said. “No more cages for you.”\n\n“Thank you, Mr. Crow,” I said. “Will you come with me?”\n\nMr. Crow shook his head.\n\n“I am an old bird,” he said. “And my journey is coming to a close. But yours is just beginning.”\n\nMr. Crow flapped his wings and took flight, and I never saw him again. As I stepped out of the front door my bare feet touched the grass for the very first time, and I could smell the flowers on the breeze as it drifted over me.\n\nAt that moment, though my feet were firmly on the ground, my heart was soaring through endless blue sky, far above the world that I had left behind.\n\nI still wake up every morning to hear the birds sing, and when the first few notes break the silence of the early dawn, I think of Mr. Crow and smile.\n\n[x](http:\/\/facebook.com\/lifeisstrangemetoo)"},"282":{"title":"I’m a Firewatcher. I found another Firewatcher’s unsettling journal at my new station.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/adt7vs\/im_a_firewatcher_i_found_another_firewatchers\/","flair":null,"author":"flard","selftext":"**I am a firewatcher. Upon moving in to my station, I found the following pages typed on my desk. I am not the author of the following. I am transcribing exactly what I found, dated 1989:**\n\n---------------\n\n----\n\nI’ve been located here for 185 days, according to my calendar. I’m stationed up in the northwest of the United States with two other guys—Clark and Thomas. \n\n185 days. That’s five days longer than our stint here should’ve been. Normally, they rotate us out every 180 days. We were supposed to be picked up by Helicopter 5 days ago.\n\nI started writing this logbook, journal, whatever, because we’re overdue for evac. Or so we think. Maybe we messed up the calendar somehow.\n\nOur main radio stopped working on day 179.\n\n“Get up! There’s smoke.”\n\nBleary-eyed, I saw Clark standing over my bunk. I could see the orange slits of light reflecting on his torso, signaling to me it was the early morning.\n\n“Teddy! Smoke!”\n\n“Smoke? Huh?” I said, still half-delirious.\n\n“Yes, smoke. A really small stream of it maybe a mile southeast.” His eyes were wide and brighter than the sunlight on his uniform.\n\nI pulled myself out of the bottom bunk and headed towards the window. I didn’t even need my binoculars to see the small sliver of smoke creating a shadow in the early sun’s light. In 185 days, it’s only the second time we’ve seen a potential fire.\n\nFor those who don’t know what a fire watchtower looks like, it’s basically a wooden cabin elevated about 100 feet in the air. Ours has a staircase that wraps around the structure beneath the cabin. I’m pretty sure other towers use ladders, but that’s beside the point.\n\nClark and I bunk up in the watch tower. We have a little kitchen, our bunk bed, and a 360-degree view of nothing but woods. Thomas sleeps in a tiny little cabin at the base of our tower, which is also where our main office is. ‘Office’ may be too loose of a term. It’s one desk and a typewriter used for typing out reports of what we see out here.\n\nI rubbed my eyes and looked over to Clark, “alright, let’s go check it out.”\n\n“No way, Teddy. No way,” he replied immediately.\n\nClark has been afraid to go past the outhouse since day 180 passed. He’s afraid a helicopter will come, and he’ll miss his chance to be rescued.\n\n‘Rescued’ Clark would say. But are we in danger? Did we miscalculate the number of days we’ve been out here? We still have plenty of food. Did they forget about us? Has the apocalypse come and gone and we don’t know because we’ve been isolated?\n\n“Okay, fine,” I agreed, “Radio down to Thomas and let him know. He should be up.”\n\nOur main radio back to base isn’t getting a sign of life from anywhere. And if it isn’t receiving from anywhere, we assume we aren’t being heard from anywhere. Luckily, we still have our own walkie-talkies to communicate with each other.\n\nClark took out his walkie.\n\n“Tom, there’s some smoke about a mile southeast. Can you go check it out?”\n\nA few seconds passed before Thomas responded.\n\n“After I finish wiping my ass I’ll be on my way. Unless you wanna help me with that Clarky.”\n\nThomas, the oldest of us, is always picking on Clark, the youngest. He doesn’t really dislike Clark. He is just easy to pick on. He’s a twenty-three-year-old college dropout. I think he studied accounting or finance or something on his parents’ dime. I don’t think he left college to be a professional firewatcher. No, I think he left to come out in the wilderness, be alone, and take a retrospective look at his life to decide what he really wants.\n\nYou only sign up for 180 days of isolation if you’re crazy, or if you want to get away from something. I’m not sure which category Thomas falls is. He’s a cryptic, brute of a man. His picture is probably in the dictionary next to “lumberjack.” He’s pretty quiet unless he has a joke to tell or something important to say. Either way, when he opens his mouth, I listen.\n\nAs for me, it’s not important why I’m out here.\n\n“Headed out now,” Thomas radioed. \n\nClark and I watched Thomas start his trek into the tree line until we could no longer see him.\n\nClark cocked his head towards mine.\n\n“Teddy,” he said to me, “Thomas has been acting... different. Weird.”\n\nI didn’t expect him to be so blunt. But I had noticed. I knew Clark had noticed, but this was the first time we spoke about it.\n\n“I know.”\n\n“He doesn’t seem to be bothered that we are stuck out here.”\n\n“We don’t *know* if we are stuck out here. We could’ve scratched off the dates wrong. You know—we thought we didn’t scratch the day off yet but we really did, so we accidentally scratch the next day too.”\n\n“I guess,” Clark said softly. I knew what he was going to say next.\n\n“At night though—”\n\n“Shut it, Clark.”\n\n“C’mon Teddy! It’s fucked up. He’s fine during the day and then just, just changes. Does he have some type’a illness? It happened so sudden!”\n\n“Maybe he does! So what if the guy goes out at night to stare at trees?”\n\n“Trees? Stare at trees?”\n\n“I know you’ve seen it. He goes out near the tree line and stands there for a while looking out. Sometimes hours. Maybe he does have a screw loose, and maybe he shouldn’t be out here. But I don’t think it’s the best idea to bring it up to him when we are trapped here with him, especially if he *is* insane.”\n\nSilence fell between us before Clark responded.\n\n“I didn’t know he stares out at the forest,” he said to me in a soft voice and eyes wider than when he woke me up this morning.\n\n“Oh—wait, what? What were you going to say?”\n\n“At—At night,” he stammered, “he comes up the stairs.”\n\nI looked over to our half-open door leading out to the staircase, letting a cool breeze in.\n\n“Wh—what do you—what?”\n\n“He comes up the stairs, and, and just, looks at us. Stares at us.”\n\n------------\n\nThomas left to go check out the smoke about an hour ago. It seems to have vanished, so I figure he handled it. \n\nClark spends his days using our walkie talkies, trying every station possible to alert anyone nearby.\n\nI just watch the forest.\n\n---------------\n\nIt’s 11:30 PM. Thomas isn’t back. He left at about 7 AM. He hasn’t answered his radio.\n\nTomorrow will be day 186. We do not know if Thomas is okay, and one of us will most likely have to check the woods tomorrow—and since Clark is chicken-shit, it'll end up being me.\n\nMore disturbing though, is something Clark told me a few minutes ago—the reason I went back to the office to type this.\n\nI was leaned back in my swivel chair, spinning slowly, making sure there were no lights or fires in the dark expanse of trees, and wondering where Thomas was. He must’ve been hurt. Even if he was lost, he’d reply on his walkie. We always answer our walkies. They’re with us at all times, even when we are shitting or showering.\n\nClark stopped my chair mid-spin and mid-thought. Before I could protest, he spoke.\n\n“Listen. I need to tell you something I’ve been thinking about recently. It’s eating away at me.”\n\nI wondered if it had to do with Thomas.\n\n“Okay,” I said. “I’m all ears.”\n\n“It’s going to sound crazy,” he warned.\n\n“I bet I’ve heard crazier.”\n\nHe took a long, yet stuttered inhale, then spoke. “I don’t remember coming out here.”\n\nMy facial expression didn’t change, and it looked like he was waiting for a reaction, so he repeated.\n\n“I don’t remember coming out here. Do you? Do you remember applying for this job? Do you remember being interviewed? Or being flown out here?”\n\nAt first, I was almost amused. \n\nThen as he asked those questions, I froze.\n\nI didn’t remember.\n\nHe continued, “You know how I said I decided to leave college? Well, now that I’m thinking about it harder, I don’t know if I did. I mean I must have, right? To be out here? I must have. But all I can remember is my last day of class for the semester, and then I was here. I don’t remember anything between coming home after class and meeting you and Thomas.”\n\nI was listening, but it probably didn’t show. I was still motionless.\n\nI couldn’t remember. I tried and am still trying.\n\nThomas is missing.\n\nClark and I are losing our minds or—or something else.\n\nEither way, I can’t explain it yet.\n\n-----\n\n----------\n\n**There are more pages scattered about, but I haven’t figured out the order.

It happened on an ordinary afternoon, at the point in my daily routine when I walked home from the bus stop. In the four blocks between the corner where I hopped off the bus and my front door, I started to feel nauseous.\n\nIt came on suddenly, without warning. I’d felt just fine all day, ate a lunch of bosco sticks and marinara sauce, something I’d eaten hundreds of times throughout high school. Before I had an opportunity to consider alternative causes, I broke out in a cold sweat.\n\nThen I felt the curious flutter in my chest.\n\nMy heart slipped into what I later learned was an episode of ventricular fibrillation.\n\nI became breathless and collapsed. What happened next has been told to me after the fact. I apparently sprawled in the road, where a woman driving a hatchback nearly crushed my skull beneath her tires. Instead, she screeched to a halt, tried to rouse me, then dialled emergency services when she failed to do so.\n\nEMS arrived to discover my heart had stopped beating. I was dead, technically. They transported my body to the hospital, and somewhere along the way managed to shock my ticker back to life. Thus began a harrowing weeks-long journey through the American healthcare system that led eventually to an ablation, pacemaker, and mountains of debt my family’s still dealing with.\n\nBut my heart’s alright.\n\nAnd thank f\\*\\*k it is, because what I learned that day has taught me never to thank God for anything.\n\nBecause for those six minutes, as my lifeless body traveled across the city accompanied by two paramedics working tirelessly to revive me, my soul transcended our world to visit the hereafter. During my visit, I learned things about our universe that I wish I hadn’t. Perhaps in sharing my story, I might help our species prepare for what comes after we expire.\n\nIt began with light. Blinding, white, pervasive. It bathed me, calmed me. It was everything they tell you about. Beatific, welcoming, the stuff of spiritual experiences.\n\nI had the distinct feeling of ascent, like the light was lifting me skyward. I passed through several sets of gates, which my dizzied consciousness hardly registered. Upon reflection, I don’t believe they were physical in any sense, and yet I recall the feeling of admittance, as if they might’ve prevented me from rising had they remained closed.\n\nIn any event, I arrived in a place without dimension, a place beyond reality. It only made sense while I occupied it. I don’t believe a corporeal being can make sense of the astral plane, something about its intangible existence defies translation.\n\nSo what I came away with were more impressions than images. I was not alone. Several life forces enclosed me upon my arrival. At first, because of my Christian upbringing, I believed them to be angels. In my incorporeal form, I made the spiritually-equivalent gesture of opening my arms, anticipating their embrace.\n\nInstead, I felt myself shackled by their powers, like a collared dog. Humiliation and terror came over me. These were not the ethereal beings I’d been led to believe await us. These were cruel, unsympathetic overlords by whom I was fettered.\n\nWhy? I thought, my soul wailing like a petulant child.\n\nSomething like laughter returned, but it was cold, mocking. Thoughts floated into my consciousness like birds winging in and out of sight. They delivered some horrifying truths about existence that I’ll do my best to relay to you now:\n\nOur universe, like many others running parallel to it, contains a pittance of the total energy in existence. It is a farm, used to produce souls, which only arise in the precise conditions found in our cosmos. When you hear scientists talk about the improbability of the existence of our goldilocks universe, it’s because they don’t actually come into being spontaneously.\n\nThey’re designed. And the hands that craft them are not benevolent gods, but rapacious beings with little care for the creatures they create.\n\nOur ultimate purpose, I learned in the custody of the spirits that shackled me, was to ripen until we were ready to serve them on their higher plane.\n\nThe Big Bang gave birth to the universe to give rise to life to eventuate in humanity, a sufficiently conscious organism that may be harvested for use as slaves on a higher plane, where time and space dissolve into an eternity we spend in servitude.\n\nSix minutes in “heaven” felt like a lifetime, which I spent amusing what I perceived to be a childlike spirit with a penchant for psychologically distressing manipulation. It batted me around like a cat with a caught mouse, reveling in the pain it produced. Physical discomforts we imagine hell inflicting upon us pale in comparison to the torture of soul pain. Loss of a loved one comes closest, that piercing, emotional damage resulting from trauma.\n\nWhen it became clear my time had not yet expired on Earth and I was to return, I was told not to reveal their existence to the rest of my kind. My reward, they communicated to me, would be a marginally improved station among the slave population. Alternatively, if I managed to convince others of their existence, new horrors would await me when I returned.\n\nI can’t imagine anything worse than what I experienced, subsumed beneath an ineffable grief and torment.\n\nFor weeks, I tried to explain to anyone who would listen what I experienced. Everyone told me I’d suffered a very serious and traumatic experience for a young man, that the event left scars on my psyche as well as my heart.\n\nI gave up trying to convince them.\n\nI slowly began to convince myself that what they’d told me was true. I’d simply imagined it. A death dream, as it were. The mind reckoning with its own imminent demise, trying to make sense of the experience.\n\nThen I met someone who claimed to have met God.\n\nThis was a few years later, when the author of a nonfiction book recounting their near death experience visited my hometown. (I won’t reveal the author’s name as I don’t want to invite a lawsuit, which I’m sure he’d launch against me if he read that I’d besmirched him.) I attended a reading and afterward confronted him about his tale. \n\nI looked him in the eye and asked if he really met God – something I’m sure he’s dealt with hundreds of times. He smiled and nodded, assuring me that yes, God is real and is filled with love. On a lark, I decided to tell him that I knew the truth, that slavery awaits us all.\n\nA flicker in his gaze betrayed his knowledge of the fact. He really had died and visited the afterlife, but lied about it in his book.\n\nBecause he knew.\n\nHe knew the truth of heaven, the horrible place our souls are bound [for](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/JulianVoss\/)."},"284":{"title":"I Met a Demon on the Tokyo Subway","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/7ifrz1\/i_met_a_demon_on_the_tokyo_subway\/","flair":null,"author":"lifeisstrangemetoo","selftext":"This story is a retelling of something that happened to me when I was seven years old. As the years have gone by and I’ve grown up, I’ve realized that the story cannot possibly be true, yet I can’t shake the feeling that it is.\n\nIt happened in Tokyo, in the subway station. I was standing with my father when I saw the demon, a monstrously tall and furry creature with leathery black wings and a snout like an anteater. I must have stared at him for close to ten minutes before he finally spoke, in a soft mutter that was clearly intended for his ears only.\n\n“This human is creeping me out,” he said. “It almost looks like it’s looking right at me.”\n\n“I am looking right at you,” I said.\n\nThe demon nearly jumped out of his skin. “You can see me?” he asked.\n\n“Yes. Can’t everybody?”\n\n“Not unless they’re in the fifth dimension.”\n\n“Am I in the fifth dimension?” I asked.\n\n“Your mind must have slipped over here by mistake. What were you thinking about before you saw me?”\n\nI thought for a moment, and then grinned.\n\n“Trains.”\n\n“Oh, well trains are the link between our dimensions. I guess your mind must have just wandered over here. Either that or you’re going crazy.”\n\n“I hope I’m not going crazy,” I said.\n\n“Being crazy is a good thing in the fifth dimension,” the demon replied.\n\nI laughed.\n\n“Do you have subway lines in the fifth dimension?” I asked.\n\n“Of course,” he said. “How else would we get to work?”\n\n”You’ve got wings!” I said.\n\n“Yes, but who wants to fly? Taking the train is so much faster, and if I fly to work I’m all sweaty when I get there.”\n\n“So what do you use your wings for?” I asked.\n\n“I put them over my head when it rains.”\n\n“Can I see?” I asked.\n\n“Sure,” the demon said. My hair blew back as he swooped his enormous wings over his head.\n\nI laughed again.\n\n“You’re funny,” I said.\n\nThe demon laughed too, but then his expression changed.\n\n“Are you okay?” I asked. “You seem sad.”\n\n“Yes, yes.” the demon replied, not looking at me but at something behind me. “Say, would you like to see a magic trick?”\n\n“Okay.”\n\nThe demon reached up and tugged a big rainbow handkerchief out of his snout. He must have pulled out twenty feet before he ran out.\n\n“That’s funny.” I laughed, but I stopped when I realized I wasn’t holding my dad’s hand anymore.\n\nI looked around and saw the subway station had disappeared, replaced by flowing green meadows that were full of old trains.\n\n“I can’t see the subway station anymore,” I said.\n\n“That’s okay,” said the demon. “Sometimes it’s better to see what isn’t there instead of what is.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Sometimes when I’m bored or sad, my mind slips off to the third dimension, and I see people like you.”\n\n“That’s funny,” I laughed. “Can you go to other dimensions, too?”\n\nBut the demon didn’t answer, he was looking up at the sky.\n\n“It’s starting to rain,” he said, whooshing his wings up over his head.\n\nWarm droplets of rain hit my face. \n\n“Can I get under your wings with you?” I asked.\n\n“Not now,” he replied. “You’ve got to go home.”\n\nThe world began to shimmer and flow together like different shades of green and golden paint, spinning around faster and faster in circles. I started to feel a little sick, and I closed my eyes. The world stopped spinning, but warm droplets of water still fell on my face.\n\nI opened my eyes and saw my mom crying over me, but I didn’t see my dad.\n\n“Where’s dad?” I asked her. “Did he bring me home?”\n\n“Yes, darling,” she said, although she didn’t look at me when she said it. “He brought you home and then he had to go away.”\n\n“Oh,” I replied. “When will he be back?”\n\n“I don’t know,” she said.\n\nMy dad never did come back, and it was years before I found out the truth: he had killed himself that day. That morning he had written a note to my mother explaining that he intended to bring me along and step in front of the train with me. My mother found it when she got home from work and called the police, but it was too late to stop my father. The witnesses say that just before he jumped I pulled away from his hand and ran off, fainting right after. But one of the witnesses, a little boy around my age, said that he saw something take my hand and lead me away from the speeding train.\n\nHe said it was a monstrously tall and furry creature, with leathery black wings and an anteater’s snout.\n\n[x](http:\/\/Facebook.com\/lifeisstrangemetoo)"},"285":{"title":"I work at NASA. We made alien contact yesterday.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/c1wxxu\/i_work_at_nasa_we_made_alien_contact_yesterday\/","flair":"Series","author":"None","selftext":"Part 2 - https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/c521t1\/i_work_at_nasa_we_made_alien_contact_last_week\/\n\nI can't tell you who I am, and I can't tell you the name of the program, but what I can tell you is that if what they say is true, we're in trouble.\n\nNow, we didn't make contact in the way you would think we would. We didn't beam out an episode of The Office towards Andromeda and hear back from alien critics. And we definitely didn't meet them face to face. We found another way to communicate. Something, apparently ancient humans had figured out as well.\n\nThere are countless dilapidated ancient structures around the world, and some of them, not all, but some, were communication arrays. At least a handful on each continent. I'm sure you'll be able to think of a few after I describe what we did.\n\nWe've been working on this technology for a while. There has been a long standing theory that sound has a much larger part in the universe than just being random vibrations. That the universe is simply a bunch of vibrations and sound, and if you find a way to manipulate those vibrations properly, you could do things that seem impossible. We proved that yesterday. \n\nBy creating an extremely, extremely, EXTREMELY, precise echo chamber, and playing certain frequencies into it, at precisely the right volumes, and the exact right timings, we broke some sort of barrier.\n\nNothing really happened, visually at least. We had run countless tests like these with tiny, minute differences, and this one seemed pretty mundane. There was a slight unnatural thrumming, the glass between us and the echo chamber shook in regular intervals as if we were playing a bass heavy song too loudly. The first thing that tipped us off that something was happening was that once we turned the speakers off, the thrumming didn't stop. My three coworkers and I could all feel this thrumming in out chests still, kind of like being next to a very loud drum. We talked for a moment, before we all fell silent.\n\nThere was something else now. It wasn't a voice. It was, some sort of, intellegent vibration. I can't explain it. It was like a voice was inside my chest, but it wasn't speaking, I could just feel what it was saying. My cohorts and I debated on the exact wording afterwards, but we all agreed on the overall messages each time. \n\nLike I said, they weren't really talking, so I'll do my best to phrase it in ways that get across what they said, in the way they \"said\" it. \n\n\"Wooooaaaahhh, you guys are back?\" Is what I felt in my chest. My colleagues and I stared at each other in utter confusion. One of the spoke up. \"Hello?\" He asked hesitantly. There was a silence for a moment, before the thrumming spoke back. \"I think I have it set right now, say that again?\"\n\n\"Hello?\" I repeated back to it in place of the other scientist. \n\n\"Yep, there it is.\" He said quickly. \"You guys figured it out again! That's crazy!\" It exclaimed. This wasn't what I was thinking the first human\/alien conversation was going to go. I wasn't even sure that this was first contact at this point though. \"Who is this? What is this?\" I asked loudly into the open air of our control room.\n\n\"I'm not sure if I'm allowed to give you details like who we are, but, what this is, is the ultimate form of communication in our universe. Your ancestors figured it out briefly too.\" With some quick deduction on how it was wording things, I think each of us figured out what we were talking to was alien in origin around the same time.\n\n\"Where are you from?\" I asked. \"You have to be close.\" Hell, with the way we were talking back and forth, they had to be REALLY close. It takes communications to Mars a few minutes to get there, just because that's as fast as light is. If we were talking this quickly back and forth they basically had to be on Earth.\n\n\"I guess you wouldn't know. We didn't tell your ancestors. We didn't think they'd get it. Let me do some math real quick.\" It was about a minute before it spoke again. \"What you see as your observable universe, thats not the whole universe. Not even close. Multiply that by about 15, and thats about how far we are away. And theres a lot past that.\" \n\nWe all looked at each other. It was speaking utter bullshit to us now. That was impossible, we'd never be able to communicate, ever. Physically impossible. We explained that to the chest-voice, and we were met by an equal level of confusion. \"Why are you still using light as a yardstick?\" It asked incredulously. Suddenly, its voice grew slightly dire. \"You're still not advanced enough. You don't even know.\" \n\n\"Know what?\" One of my friends asked.\n\n\"You are dead center in the Life Abyss. There is no life on any planet around you, for more than ten of your observable universes around you in any direction. Its a universal mystery how you're even alive.\" It spoke grimly. Never in my life had I felt smaller, more insignificant and more alone. It continued. \n\n\"And there is a reason for that.\""},"286":{"title":"I just graduated from medical school, and my new hospital has some very strange rules","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/dj5fgp\/i_just_graduated_from_medical_school_and_my_new\/","flair":null,"author":"ByfelsDisciple","selftext":"You probably think that all doctors are filthy rich, because I sure as hell did in the beginning. Eight years and a fistful of premature gray hairs later, I’m just a few hundred thousand dollars poorer than “broke.” That would matter if I had a family to provide for, but the long hours in med school have led to an end of my last relationship and a countdown on the shelf life of my ovaries. \n\nI was in a “take what I can get and be grateful” situation. \n\nSo when St. Francis Hospital in Charleston, West Virginia offered me a position, I packed my sad life into three bags and sought opportunity in the hills of Appalachia. Nineteen of us started in July, and thirteen have since dropped out. \n\nI like to think of myself as the rat that wouldn’t drown.\n\nSome people broke inside after watching children die because they weren’t good enough doctors quite yet (everyone has to be a rookie at some point). It’s doubly hard when you have to inform the dead child’s parents, who then beg you to tell them different news, or scream that they want to die and just please kill them with whatever drug takes away the pain.\n\nBut most of my incoming class couldn’t handle the chief of medicine. \n\nDr. Vivian Scritt is, without a doubt, the biggest bitch I’ve ever met. \n\nNow I know why.\n\n“Nineteen of you start today, and we’ve got a pool going with bets on how long each of you will last,” she told us on Day One. “Don’t feel any pressure, folks. I’ve talked with each of you in private, and my expectations are very low.” \n\nShe peered condescendingly over her thin spectacles, snorted, then turned around to walk away. \n\n“You should know when to follow me and when to stay away, because I’m not going to waste time explaining what you should figure out on your own.”\n\nWe gawked at one another, all feeling weak and small, then scampered after her. \n\nI was last in line, and felt out of place taking even that much.   \n \n“You should have the list of expectations for St. Francis,” Dr. Scritt explained as she walked on, not bothering to look at us as she talked. “I printed eighteen sets of rules so that you would have to challenge one another for them, knowing that one of you would be left behind.”\n\nAn icy cold settled in the pit of my stomach as I saw everyone look down at a list of rules that only I did not have. \n\n“If you cannot follow these rules, there will be no place for you in this hospital. It most likely means that you are unsuited to be a doctor, and should consider a profession that demands a weaker mental aptitude.” At that, she turned around to face us all. “And if you think that I’m the type to give second chances after a mistake, you’re woefully underprepared for the world of medicine.” She stopped and looked at each of us in turn, apparently expecting a response that no one dared to offer.\n\n“Well,” she shot out in exasperation, “why are you standing here? People are dying. Get to work!”\n\n*\n\nNo one wanted to show me their list of rules, so I had to wait until one of my classmates died.\n\nIt took nearly a week. \n\nI was working at 3:00 a. m. because I had only been on the clock for ten hours. I was rushing into another room so that a patient wouldn’t know I was Googling his symptoms (doctors do this FAR more than you realize) when I saw Myron by himself in an O. R. \n\nI stopped immediately. “Myron?” I squeaked. “What the hell is that?” \n\nHis arms were working furiously, but his back was turned toward me, so I couldn’t see what he was doing.\n\nSomething felt wrong. \n\nMyron was the pick of our litter. He’d been top ten in his class at John Hopkins, and he would remind us of that fact in exchange for answering the questions that we were too terrified to ask Dr. Scritt.\n\nSlowly, I approached Myron, not wanted to startle him. “We’re really busy right now, is there something you need help with?”\n\nHe showed no outward signs that he had heard me. Instead, he kept pumping away furiously at the task at hand. \n\nWhen I was five steps from him, I could see drops of blood flying over his shoulder. \n\nWhich made no sense, since he had been alone in the room.\n\n“Myron?” I whispered, barely loudly enough to hear my own words.\n\nI slowly crept around his left side, finally bringing the scene into full view.\n\nMyron’s abdomen was split from sternum to pelvis. His esophagus spilled out, and his stomach sat on the table. A nest of quivering small intestine led from the bottom of his stomach back into his shredded torso. \n\nMyron showed no outward signs of pain.\n\nHe was too busy working.\n\nHe clutched his own stomach tightly in his left hand, the folds squirting through his fingers like unbaked bread. His right hand was working furiously with a scalpel, sawing his organ into ribbons. Rivers of sweat poured down his forehead with the intensity of the effort.\n\nI tried to scream, but it only came out as a moan.\n\nThat was enough to get Myron to notice me.\n\nSlowly, he raised his head. Slowly, he smiled.\n\nIt was not a happy smile.\n\nWith eye contact locked on me, he licked his lips, angrily stabbed a piece of his stomach, and lifted it to his mouth.\n\nHe bit.\n\nHe chewed.\n\nThen he lunged.\n\nBut most people don’t know how to move with their innards splayed out for all the world to see, and this was his downfall. Myron’s tattered guts caught on the corner of the table, and he fell to the floor. \n\nFinally, he screamed. \n\nI had learned very early in my medical career that compartmentalization is indispensible. That instinct took over my brain in the moment, and I acted clinically.\n\nMyron was still grasping his scalpel with his right hand. I kicked it – hard – and it flew out of his hands.\n\nHe stared at me and screeched.\n\nWith his entrails still wrapped around the table, I figured my best option was retreat. I moved to the back of the room as a doctor and a janitor burst in. \n\nAnd in possibly the most shocking moment of the night, I realized that they were *not* shocked. \n\nMyron was anesthetized, subdued, and extracted within a minute of their arrival. \n\nFor a moment, I was alone with a pool of blood and diced stomach lining. \n\nAnd something else.\n\nA sheet of paper lay on the floor, its corner just touching the edge of the creeping blood. \n\nMyron had dropped his list of rules. \n\nThe practical part of my brain continued to drive me. I snatched the paper from the ground, then quickly exited the room, taking care to avoid the puddle.\n\nI didn’t want to leave any bloody footprints in my wake. \n\nI knew that I had to read the list as soon as I was able to find thirty uninterrupted seconds to myself. Three hours later, I had my opportunity and ducked into a janitor’s closet. With a shaking, *exhausted* hand, I pulled the chain on a bare bulb, tried to ignore the noxious smell of leaking ammonia, and read.\n\n-------------\n\n**St. Francis Hospital Rules – Guidelines for new doctors**\n\n1 – Never, under any circumstances, share your copy of the rules with anyone else.\n\n2 – If any other doctor displays erratic behavior, leave the area immediately. Do not make eye contact.\n\n3 – If any other doctor is approached or detained by someone in a janitor’s uniform, do not interfere. Never ask about that former doctor again. \n\n4 – Never touch any seemingly abandoned Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups. Those are Dr. Scritt’s favorite candy.\n\n5 – Any child that dies in St. Francis hospital MUST be cremated within 120 minutes of official time of death. If you suspect this rule has been broken, alert Dr. Scritt, and the hospital will be evacuated. \n\n6 – There is no Children’s Burn Unit at St. Francis hospital. If you find yourself there, continue walking until you return to familiar territory. This usually requires traveling in a straight line down the central hallway for 47 minutes. You will not reach a wall during that interval.\n\n7 – This rule is on a need-to-know basis.\n\n8 – A small quantity of sulfuric acid is kept in every room. This is ONLY intended for use on patients with severed spinal cords. If they attack, a hypodermic injection of H2SO4 into the cranium is the only way to subdue the subject. \n\n9 – The morgue must house at least 13 cadavers at all times.\n\n10 – If find yourself on the hospital roof with no memory of how you got there, you have only two choices. Either wait for an extraction team to find you, or jump four stories to the sidewalk on Court Street.\n\n11 – If you see Room 1913, do not look directly at the numbers. Do not open the door. This is, by far, the most important rule.\n\n---------------\n\nMy heart stopped when the door opened.\n\nDr. Scritt was staring at me. What little emotion shined through her exterior seemed to be surprise.\n\nWe both stood, frozen, for five seconds of agonized silence. \n\n“Dr. Afelis,” she drawled gravely, “I’m shocked.” She stared down at the bloodstained list of rules in my hand.\n\nI reached for words. *Any* words, because literally any response would make me look less guilty than I did in that moment, staring up at my boss’s boss’s boss and saying literally nothing in my defense as she weighed my soul with her eyes.\n\nAnd I said nothing. \n\n“You took a list that wasn’t yours, and were nowhere to be found after your coworker experienced such an *unnatural* incident.” Dr. Scritt huffed through her nose. “It seems that *you’re* willing to do the unthinkable in the name of getting what you need. And *Myron* couldn’t’ even follow the most important rule.” She clenched her teeth. “I had a four-year streak of predicting which incoming doctors will break the soonest. This will *ruin* my chances in the office pool.”\n\nThe ghost of a smile graced her lips before she turned to leave. \n\n“Get to work, doctor. You’ve got three hours left on your shift, and those symptoms aren’t going to Google themselves.”\n\nI didn’t realize that I’d been holding my breath until I heard my own gasp for air.\n\nShaking, I slowly emerged from the janitor’s closet. I quickly stuffed the list of rules back into my pocket, reflecting on the fact that I had just achieved what *might* be considered an actual win.\n\nPerhaps, just maybe, I would keep my head above water at St. Francis after all. \n\nI turned to head down the hall when I stopped in my tracks. \n\nEverything was unfamiliar. What the hell had happened?\n\nI glanced all around. The design of the hallway was familiar, but everything was *off.* I could hear people talking in the rooms, but the immediate vicinity was devoid of all people but myself.\n\nNothing made sense.\n\nThen I looked up.\n\nAnd I’ll be honest, I peed just a little when I read the sign.\n\n*ST.

It was a remarkable feat of engineering, this little beast; designed with such care that even the equipment on the hull could withstand more water pressure than the sea could muster up at any achievable depth. It was my Pegasus. My Trojan Horse; my very own *Apollo 11* - and inside this matrix of layered syntactic foam I would follow the ballasts to the gratuitous and unexplored depths of Higgin’s Maw. \n\n\nI began the separation sequence, and the deep-diver fell away from the escort and dipped beneath the surface of the Pacific with silence and grace and a few knots of speed, and then I was consumed in a whole new world - albeit one I’d frequented - that of the sea. Schools of fish swam on by me, and when their cloud passed through a sunbeam it glinted silver, and beneath them swam rays that rolled their wings to the beat of the current, and out in the rocks crawled the crustaceans and sat the plant life that spruced up all the white-washed stones there like holiday ornaments. But I had an appointment to keep, and the oxygen tank was a demanding clock, so I dove right on past the old reef and out into the open waters where the seabed couldn’t be seen for many, many miles yet. \n\n\n*”The Maw,” Reuben had said. “Fifty thousand feet below the surface, Booker. Fifty* thousand. *Do you know what that means?”*\n\n\n*”Means its a whole hell of a lot deeper down than the Challenger Abyss.”*\n\n\n*He’d nodded at that. “Are you ready to make history?”*\n\n\nWas I? I thought I was. I’d prepared for this lonely dive and nothing else, for some years now. It was the culmination of a lifetime of work and study in the field, and so tight was its grip on my mind that I often dreamt of it in my sleep; of what I’d find at the bottom, and what it would mean. *And what monstrous things might take offense to my presence there.*\n\n\nNo. *No.* I shoved that thought aside. *Tuscany* was all the protection I needed in that regard; it offered technology on the bleeding edge in lieu of a heavy hull, and that was enough to withstand enough water pressure to crush bones beneath skin and inches of steel. What animal had jaws more powerful than the ocean itself at fathom?\n\n\nSo I hit the thrusters, and down I went, like a bullet to the pitch. I eyed the depth meter as much as I did the sea. One hundred feet. Two hundred. Sharks and turtles and uncountable fish swept past me. Three hundred feet. Five hundred feet. Seven hundred. A thousand. Twelve-fifty - *the inversed height of the Empire State building.* Fifteen hundred. Sixteen. \n\n\nThe water began to blur and grain up and darken as the sunlight struggled to push on through. Two thousand. Twenty five. Three thousand. Thirty two - *where the light no longer shines.* \n\n\nAnd soon all the light I had to spill glow to the path ahead and down, were the lights of the *Tuscany.*\n\n\nI continued the descent for hours. The pressure meter ticked up in spasmic bursts, but up it went, up, up, up, soon ticking past the point where the weight of the sea would’ve crushed the steel of another vessel. One mile down. One point three. One point six - *where even Sperm Whales hit their lowest dive.* I could now claim with confidence that no mammal on earth was as deep down at that very moment as myself. And still I dove. Two miles. Two point one. Two point two. \n\n\nThe water was as black as space now, except for where the lights of the *Tuscany* pierced through it, and the thickness of the fluid made it look like ink or oil or some kind of alien sludge that smeared up against the reinforced windows and slimed its way across the hull. Things were tight down here, despite the vastness of it all, yet still I dove. \n\n\nThirteen thousand feet. *The Abyssal zone. Pressure stands at 11,000 psi.* I saw an Angler float by, and it was startled by the sheer volume of light spread by the *Tuscany* that dwarfed its own bioluminescent glow. It swam away, and I dove further. Fifteen thousand feet. Three miles. Three point one. \n\n\n*Now things get interesting.*\n\n\nMankind had visited these depths almost infrequently enough to count the expeditions on a single pair of hands. I was now ranked among an illustrious few explorers, and although I wasn’t the first to hit these marks, I’d hit the deepest one yet before this journey was over. I was determined and I was capable. So I checked the depth chart. *Sixteen thousand, two hundred eighty one point four feet.* Nearly halfway to the world record. The *Tuscany* continued its dive.\n\n\nTwenty thousand feet down. *The Hadal zone. Pressure here is eleven hundred times what it is at the surface.* Twenty two thousand feet. Twenty six. Twenty nine thousand - *The height of Mount Everest.* Thirty. Thirty point five. Thirty one - *the same distance from the surface as a commercial airliner at the peak of its flight.* \n\n\nThe Challenger Deep, what had previously been the lowest recorded place on the seabed, sat at roughly 36,000 feet below the surface, in the depths of the Mariana Trench. No light from the sun had ever come close, and to the best accounts life existed there, but only sparsely, and the pressure is unspeakable. \n\n\nBut I was going somewhere vastly deeper, even, than that. \n\n\n*”All we know is we found a canyon,” Reuben had said. “Dwarfs the Grand - sitting dead center in the Pacific seabed. ‘Bout twelve hundred kilometers west of Hawaii, and another nine hundred south, and, near as we can figure, some fifty thousand feet straight on down.”*\n\n\nThirty six thousand feet. I was now tied for the world record. \n\n\n“*Fifty thousand feet?! Why the hell are we just now seeing it?”*\n\n\nThirty six five. I did it. My heartbeat swept up to a faster rhythm. I was officially a world record holder; no human being in recorded history had been as deep below the surface as I was at that very moment. \n\n\n*“New seabed scanning technology helped. Gave us a more detailed topographical map of the hydrosphere than we’ve ever had before, and once we got back the results, we took a look, and there it was. Just waiting for us. Inviting us down.”*\n\n\nThirty seven. \n\n\n*”So what’s down there?*\n\n\nThirty seven three.\n\n\n*”Hell, Doctor. If we knew that we wouldn’t be sending you, would we?”* \n\n\nThirty seven nine.\n\n\n*”I suppose not.”*\n\n\nThirty eight.\n\n\nThirty eight five. \n\n\n---\n\n\n*The awful spirits of the deep*\n\n*Hold their communion there;*\n\n*And there are those for whom we weep,*\n\n*The young, the bright, the fair.*\n\n\nHiggin’s Maw, according to the best information available to me at the time of departure, is a pit, roughly a full kilometer across. It begins at approximately forty six thousand feet below the surface and is estimated to bottom out at Higgin’s Deep, a small valley that sits at its base, some five thousand additional feet below that. The Maw is the largest and deepest such formation in the hydrosphere, and yet its dimensions and location are the only things concretely known about it. That, of course, is where myself, and where the *Tuscany,* come in.\n\n\nForty three thousand feet down. I hit the floodlights underneath the *Tuscany,* and the glow washed over an alien landscape that likely hadn’t seen light in over a billion years. There were mountains here - *mountains* - ones that rivaled the Alps, and wild arches and plateaus that stretched far off to a murky horizon before being shrouded by seawater. \n\n\nI even saw *life* down here in the depths. A squid-like thing of simply monstrous size swam on by my boat. It stopped for a moment, and during that moment I thought it might take offense to me, but after looking hard at the *Tuscany* and brushing a tentacle down the port side it swam off in search of other things. \n\n\n“Atta girl.”\n\n\nI descended further. \n\n\nForty four thousand feet. Forty five. \n\n\nAnd then, all of a sudden, there it was. *The Maw.*\n\n\nMy mouth hung by the jaw as the sheer scope of the beast came into view. It was a breathtaking sight to behold; a monstrously large and equally dark hole in the crust of the earth that plummeted to inconceivable fathoms. I descended a bit further - forty five five, forty six thousand feet - and *Tuscany* fell into its yawn. Somehow things were even blacker in the depths of the thing, even though sunlight had long since been blotted out. \n\n\nForty six five. Forty seven. Forty seven two.\n\n\nI began to become aware of a low current pulling me downward. It wasn’t particularly powerful, but it was unexpected and it was therefore alarming. And yet I couldn’t bear to pull myself back up. Not yet - *I’ll turn around if it gets bad* - so down I went, deeper and deeper and deeper still into the cavern. \n\n\nForty eight thousand feet. Forty eight five. Forty nine. Forty nine one. \n\n\nAnd then I saw it. A glow. \n\n\nI squinted and dimmed my lights to confirm the intuition. *What in the name of God…?* It was there indeed, a dim reddish-purple, then green, then purple again, and then blue, floating on a mist of current some few thousand feet down. I resumed the dive to chase it. Forty nine five. Forty nine seven. Forty nine nine. The glow, whatever it was, was getting deeper, and wider, and brighter. Soon it filled up the whole path down and ahead. I dimmed the *Tuscany’s* under-lights to their lowest setting, and by fifty thousand feet I could see that the glow was coming from somewhere not directly beneath me, but off to the left and around a wide corner. \n\n\n*This cave isn’t a straight pit.* And sure enough, the hole bottomed out here, and then opened up to its left. \n\n\n*Holy God. Holy* God.\n\n\nIt was a cavern chamber, at least a full kilometer up and deep and side to side and across, and only the enormity of its radius maintained the darkness of it despite the presence of thousands of floating bioluminescent pods that pulsed purple and green and blue and red and dimmed in the interim. I took the *Tuscany* in deeper, and her cameras whirred to life. \n\n\n---\n\n\n*Calmly the wearied seamen rest*\n\n*Beneath their own blue sea.*\n\n*The ocean solitudes are blest,*\n\n*For there is purity.*\n\n\nThe cavern became darker still when the pods faded into the water behind the ship. But there were more things to be seen here than rocks. *Tuscany,* about a quarter hour after entering the chamber, soon floated on by a bizarrely rope-like plant of utterly impossible size; one that appeared to stretch nearly across the height of the cave and grew wider at the base, although the bottom of it was shrouded in blackness. I took the submarine in for a closer inspection, and hit her lights to their fullest setting. \n\n\n*Clack.* \n\n\nMy heartbeat slammed. There were suction cups on it. Each one as big as the *Tuscany* herself, and they writhed and pulsed across and down the full length of what was now very clearly a *tentacle.* In a panic I shoved *Tuscany* back and away from the thing, but when I tried to turn her around, the base of the hull collided with the beast and stuck fast to one of the cups. I gunned the thrusters and could hear a wet tearing sound as the machine ripped itself free from the cup’s grasp. \n\n\nBut then the tentacle came to life. It whipped and whirled and smacked around the cavern, and pressed itself to the roof, and then it fell down, deep beyond where the darkness blanketed the floor. \n\n\n“C’mon, baby.” I hit the thrusters again, and *Tuscany* rocketed off the way it came, through the darkness and off towards the pods, whose glow I hoped would afford me an opportunity to shut the lights off the ship and make my escape. \n\n\nIf I were so lucky. \n\n\nBut very soon I began to hear and *feel* the movement of something unspeakably *titanic* rolling across the floor of the chamber. It rumbled and thundered, and shuddered and shook, and soon clouds of dirt and rock flew up out of the black pitch and blanketed the view forward and I could hear boulders smack against the ceiling of the cave before sinking again to where they'd been. \n\n\n*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!*\n\n\n“F-fuck!!” The sound had erupted across the entire breadth of the cave at once. My eardrums nearly burst and likely would have, had it not been for muffling of the explosion provided by the walls of the *Tuscany.* The submarine shook, too, but she held up her integrity well enough to for me to fly on past the floating pods, some of which were now knocked about on their sides and rolling, and back towards the yawning mouth of the tunnel that would take me back out into the open deep s-\n\n\n*SMACK!!*\n\n\nThe *Tuscany* buckled and rolled with an impact. The Tentacle, I realized, had shot up from the ground and hit the bottom of the ship between her ballasts, but luckily it knocked her with force up towards the tunnel. I rolled *Tuscany* with the hit and managed to regain some control, and I boosted the thrusters into the turn and up again, now back into the Maw. Then I began to climb. \n\n\nFifty two thousand feet. Fifty one five. Fifty one. \n\n\n*”So what’s down there?*\n\n\n“Come on, baby. Come on. Don’t you fail me now. Don’t you *fucking* fail me now.”\n\n\n*”Hell, Doctor. If we knew that we wouldn’t be sending you, would we?”* \n\n\nFifty point five. Fifty. Forty nine nine. Forty nine six. *Tuscany* ascended with panicked speed, and all the while she did it I could feel the rumbling of the Tentacle’s pursuit in the walls of the Pit. It smashed its way on through the tunnel, and whipped and thrashed, but *Tuscany* was too quick a runner. *Forty seven five. Forty seven. Forty six eight. Forty six four. Forty six thousand feet and climbing high.* \n\n\n*”I suppose not.”*\n\n\n*Tuscany* burst out of the Maw and was about to rocket straight on back up to the surface, but then the Tentacle flew out beside her nearly smashed in her front window. I bent the controls to the edge of their set-casing, and *Tuscany* tanked to the left and up a bit and missed the ground by inches. I hit the lights again to navigate the labyrinth of rocks as I struggled to remount the climb. \n\n\nBut in the light of the ship I saw it; these weren’t rocks after all - *they were other ships.* Massive vessels, Imperial warships from ages past, bent and crooked and broken at the bottom of the sea, pulled down here by whatever it was that now threw its back to my devouring. \n\n\nThe Tentacle smashed along behind me. Mainmasts and battlements and flat-decks and rusted iron and wooden boat hulls were splintered up and tossed to the winds of the sea, never again to reconvene. I took *Tuscany* through this nautical graveyard with far, far too much speed for my safety. Under ship towers we went, and through cannon mounts and past the blades of dead engines and around upended rudders. \n\n\nThe cacophony of my flight and the destructive path set by my hunter awoke the life in the place. Fish washed out of holes, and cabins, and captain’s quarters and deep-deck stair flights and soon joined me in my effort to escape. \n\n\nBut it seemed there was no escape to be found here. The entire ground for countless miles shook and rumbled with seismic force. It was thunderously loud, and it picked up speed and violence with time. *Tuscany* finally flew up to miss a splintered crow's nest atop the mast by less than a foot, and finally used that directed momentum to put away distance between the seabed and herself with as many knots of speed as her thrusters would allow without bursting from the effort. The depth chart began to rise. \n\n\n*Forty five nine. Forty five two. Forty five thousand feet. Forty four eight.*\n\n\n“Come on, you motherf-”\n\n\n*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!*\n\n\nThe water itself seemed to shift with the sound. And then, out of nowhere, *Tuscany* was no longer the only thing spilling light to the Abyss; an orange glow flashed across the sea and for an instant illuminated nearly the entirety of its vastness. Then it blinked, and then flicked on again and stayed active. I shut off *Tuscany’s* lights to preserve every molecule of power for the ascent. \n\n\n*Forty four two. Forty four. Forty three seven.*\n\n\nBeside me in the glow I could make out other creatures retreating, too. Ones of spectacular size, again, that mankind had never catalogued and that I, sadly, would not have time at all to study. There were city-bus sized manta ray shaped things, wrapped up in clouded wisps of transparent jelly, and even that squid the size of a building, all flying upwards in a mass panic. I led the charge. \n\n\n*Forty three one. Forty two eight. Forty two three. Forty two.*\n\n\n*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!*\n\n\nI looked behind me and down through the rear window. The Maw had moved. It was alive. *God almighty. I was in the Leviathan’s throat. I was in its fucking throat!* I saw its Tentacle tongue lash out of the Maw and collect enough fish to feed a small town. *Tuscany* rocketed ever upwards as the Leviathan whipped even larger Tentacles behind it and gained speed with the force of a hurricane. \n\n\n*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!*\n\n\nThe Leviathan opened its Maw yet again and spewed forth its tentacle tongue, and with it it whipped up several Olympic swimming pools’ worth of water into a gale-force maelstrom. The Mammoth Squid was caught in its fury, I saw, and then it vanished into the pit forever when the Maw snapped shut with a thunderous, echoing *snap.* \n\n\n*Tuscany,* meanwhile, continued to rocket upwards, and managed to escape the whirlpool by a foot. \n\n\n*Thirty nine five. Thirty nine. Thirty eight seven. Thirty eight two. Thirty eight thousand feet, and climbing.*\n\n\nBut the Leviathan pursued me relentlessly, riding on the flood of its own current. Its tentacles - each dozens of feet across and a mile long, beat the water back and tried to gain speed for their host. \n\n\n*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!*\n\n\n*Thirty seven five. Thirty seven. Thirty six four.* \n\n\n*Tuscany* had proved her worth with speed, and the pressure gauge now fell in jumps. It remained in the red and would for some time, but it was falling steadily, even as the depth chart rose. \n\n\n*Twenty nine thousand feet. Twenty eight three. Twenty seven five.*\n\n\n*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!*\n\n\nBut the Leviathan hadn't given up the chase. Not yet. I could *feel* it doubling its efforts. The displaced water rocked the *Tuscany* and she buckled and rolled in the synthetic current. Then I heard the Maw open up behind me and the water begin to whip and swirl itself into a frenzy by the oceanload. I punched the thrusters to breaking point. \n\n\n“Come *on!!*” The encasing syntactic foam was pressed to its limits; the reinforced glass began to chip every so very slightly, but the chips broke into cracks and those cracks began to crawl across the width of the windows. I checked the gauges. Twenty thousand feet. Nineteen eight. Nineteen four. Nineteen three. The ascent was slowing. *Come on, baby. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Please God. Be with me now. Be w-*\n\n\n*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!!!!*\n\n\nIn the orange glow of the Levianthan’s eyes I could see how quickly the water was slipping by *Tuscany* and getting swept up into the maelstrom. The submarine began to sway port to starboard and shudder and shake. *Seventeen four. Seventeen thousand. Sixteen nine. Sixteen three. Sixteen one. Sixteen thousand.*\n\n\nI watched the gauge with a nauseating desperation. \n\n\n*Fifteen nine five. Fifteen nine two.*\n\n\nI could feel her slowing to a crawl. *Come on. Come on. Come on!*\n\n\n*Fifteen nine two five. Fifteen nine four. Fifteen nine six. \n\n\n“Shit!!” And that was it; *Tuscany* was caught, and no sooner did the depth chart begin to slip then did I feel the whole submarine lose all sense of control and tumble backwards and around. I was thrown out of my seat and smacked my nose against the roof of the pilot sphere. Blood exploded, and it drenched my shirt and sprayed the glass and the entirety of the control set. \n\n\nI grabbed my face and began to apply pressure to slow the blood loss, but *Tuscany* again flipped ballast over ballast to starboard in the whirlpool and spilled me into the hatch ladder. I felt my shoulder dislocate and my kneecap smack into the bottom rung. My head swam, and still *Tuscany* tumbled backwards. The cracks on the windows spread faster. \n\n\n*Sixteen three. Sixteen four.*\n\n\nI could *smell* the inside of the Maw though the hull of the ship. \n\n\nBut then, all at once and not a moment too soon, I got an idea. It wasn’t a particularly good one, but hell if it wasn’t better than nothing - I managed to limp and tumble my way to the controls and grip the handles as the ship rolled. *Wait for it. Wait for it. Wait…*\n\n\n*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!!!!*\n\n\n*Now!* The sound of the roar was so close every last control surface in the sphere rattled in its case. My eardrums rattled, too, but then I flared up the thrusters again, full blast and at an angle, and the *Tuscany* shuddered and flipped and shook and, with fortune, fell straight out of the maelstrom with inches to spare. I felt the edge of the Leviathan’s Maw graze the starboard side, and the impact again sent me into the roof while the ship rolled end over end over end again. I smacked my ribs up on a dip in the alcove and fell back down into the seat, head first, and then out onto the floor. \n\n\n*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!*\n\n\nI managed to right myself with my good arm and get my bearings. I was free, but only just; the *Tuscany* banked and tumbled again and rolled, slower now in the absence of the whirlpool’s flood current, but not yet in control of its pull. I tried to steer away, but it was useless; the ship flipped around the back of the Leviathan’s titanic Maw and up over its head as the beast flew on by underneath me like a freight train. And for the first time since catching the monster’s eye I began to fully appreciate the magnitude of its size. \n\n\nIt’s back was an endless, snake like and sharp-finned spine the size of a minor mountain range, and only quick maneuvering moved *Tuscany* away from the jagged back fins that chugged up towards me and sliced open the sea itself. They missed me by feet, and the blast of the current they’d swept up sent the submarine reeling backwards, off a bit further and into relative safety. \n\n\n*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!!*\n\n\nI quickly dimmed the lights to their lowest setting and caught my breath, as the full form of the Leviathan washed on past me. It stretched far away into the abyss below, for well over a mile, and dragging away behind it were thousands upon thousands of tentacles, a forest of the things, each the size of a six lane highway and tipped with razor sharp hooks and a flurry of wing-fins. It took a full three minutes for the beast to pass by me fully. And then it curved around in the other direction, and swam off in search of other things to devour. \n\n\n*Gggggggrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuuuuuggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!*\n\n\nThe form soon slipped away into a shadow. And then it was gone. \n\n\n---\n\n\nI surfaced hours later, having allowing the battered *Tuscany* to take its time with the journey. She was solely responsible for my escape - my quick thinking be damned. *A marvel of engineering indeed.* \n\n\nOnce I did break the surface I disbursed a distress beacon and then promptly collapsed from exhaustion. Evidently, I was picked up by the Coast Guard some hours after that, a few hundred miles southwest of Hawaii, and pulled from the near-wreckage of my submarine and taken to a hospital on the mainland. It was there that I woke up a full day later. \n\n\nAs I recovered I heard some isolated chatter of tremendous seismic activity near where I’d been, and how the whole ocean floor had changed and moved and shifted form. But I couldn't care less. I told the bastards what I knew. And on top of that, they have the *Tuscany* and they have all the recorded evidence, and you now have this written account. What everyone does with this information now, is entirely up to them. \n\n\nAll I know is that I won't be doing any more diving any time soon. I’ve come to a realization: that mankind has more than enough space to expand throughout and live upon and thrive in above and near the surface, and on land, and in the skies and soon, hopefully, out there amongst the stars. \n\n\nBut there are things in the sea that hold ownership of the deep. And perhaps it's best to leave it that way.

It’s called Lucky’s, which is a little ironic because if you’ve ended up here you’re anything but. If you stay too long the dust settles. Working at Lucky’s you never see the same licence plates twice, or faces for that matter. I’ve lost count of the amount of times the answer to my “Where you heading?” has been “Anywhere but back.” The lights flicker more often than not, and the jukebox sometimes spits out songs that aren't on the index cards, but the coffee’s hot, and most people who try them say the pancakes are the best they’ll ever have, and I’m inclined to agree. \n\nThe embroidered name tag on my uniform reads Isabella, but that ain’t even close to my real name. It was my mom's. Lucky’s has been here a long time. I wear it because I like hearing her name said by other people. It’s like she’s still here, still coming up in conversation. Like she might walk through the door any second and isn’t buried in the cemetery just past the strip club. \n\nLucky’s is also always open. Always. Working long shifts serving drifters and truckers and runaways, those who have become impermanent out on the highways, you get to know how to read people pretty quick. When you move around that much, always on the road, you leave parts of yourself behind sometimes, lost between the miles. Sometimes, people are just driving because there’s nothing else left to do. Working at Lucky’s I’ve seen all sorts of lost things. \n\nI once saw a man hit a deer with his truck and pull over to bury it in the red dirt, digging as the sun went down, tears a steady flow down his face as he fought the ground to cover up what he had done. I once had a man I recognised from the news leave me a blood stained $20 as a tip, sad-eyed in a denim jacket that barely hid the gun taped to his ribs. I once saw a one-armed girl no more than sixteen stand up on the roof of her car and sing, until a coyote came and sat in front of the hood, howling along. I once saw two women fistfight in the parking lot in the night outside, until one was spitting blood and teeth and then they kissed in the blue lights of the police car that happened to pass them by, faces lit up red and shining. \n\nI’ve seen the highway on fire, lines of flames between tires as the asphalt set itself alight in the heat. I’ve seen roadside baptisms, preacher pulled up with a van and a kiddie pool. I’ve seen things walking out in the desert just beyond reach of the neon sign for the motel that don’t look quite like people, shifting out in the blue night. I met a woman who showed me a photograph of the place she was buried. I often meet people who you talk with a while until their faces start to flicker, can’t quite hold up the pretence that long. I’ve met people who have to be invited inside, before they can cross the threshold. I’ve met some lovely members of a sacrificial cult who tipped well and were oh so polite, even when they asked me if I’d consider letting them harvest me. \n\nBut this is a story about - well, you read the title. \n\nIt was a Friday and I was working a night shift. I prefer nights, because when I drive home I can pretend for a while that I’m going to follow the taillights of the car in front until I leave everything in my rearview mirror, until it gets light and the desert changes to ocean, like if I rolled my windows all the way down I’d taste salt on the air. That, and I’m one of the only waitresses, shall we say, qualified, to deal with the night customers. Besides, tips are always better when the moon is out. We only have three true regulars in Lucky’s, and only two had showed so far. \n\nRose-Marie, our first and most frequent regular, was sat by the window in her brown fur coat, always drawn about her shoulders come rain or shine. Not that it ever rained here. Her hair was long and white down her back, like the moon through a glass. She waved over to me, gracing me with a wink that made her crows feet deepen, all the more beautiful for it. Rose-Marie liked whiskey in her tea. Sometimes, she fed cake crumbs to the voodoo dolls she carried in her pockets. She was also a chronic insomniac and liked the company of Lucky’s when sleep was hiding from her. \n\nShe continued to shuffle through the deck of cards she had already set up on the table top. I watched her thumbs flipping over two jokers. Rose-Marie liked to divine the future, when she had the time. She used a frayed pack of hotel playing cards, and if she was in a good mood she’d read your coffee grounds. I didn’t ask her too much, because those coffee grounds had a startling way of coming true. \n\nTable 6 was empty, and spotless as usual. It was the only table without a salt shaker, and the only one I never placed cutlery on. Only one person ever sat there.\n\nOur second regular, Jones, was sat in his usual booth, dregs of his black coffee held tight between his hands, badge resting on the table. He had his eyes closed, head bent down like he was repenting, steam curling off the lip of the mug and wrapping round his fingers. Jones was my favourite of our customers, not that I’d ever tell him. I walked past the booth and slid a bowl of sugar packets along the tabletop until it hit the mug with a soft clink. He jumped, reaching for his holster out of habit, until his eyes focused and he saw me.\n\nHe smiled, embarrassed, and it changed his face, dragging him back to life. When he smiled it was like a storm in a drought, made you want to stand and watch, and maybe stay out in it just a while longer. I wanted to put my hands over his where they had resumed their place on the mug, to feel the second hand heat through his palms. \n\nSometimes I can sense the sad in people just by the feel of their skin. They carry it around with them, bone deep, trying to hide it from the world. But sometimes you can lift it from them for a minute or two, if you have enough kindness spare. It doesn’t take much, most times. Jones was too young to be that sad. And yet. \n\n“Tired today?” I gestured with the coffee pot to his half empty cup. Everyone knew about the little girl he’d pulled from the dumpsters outside the swimming pool last week. She was the fifth one missing in three months. I could tell from the shadows like purple thumb prints beneath his eyes he’d been dreaming about her. She’d been found without her shoes on. He’d carried her to the ambulance in her socks, pink with little daisies on ‘em, small in his arms like she was asleep.  \n\nLou the fry cook had cried when I’d told him that the other day. I really liked Lou. He was almost too big to fit through the service door, and had a tattoo of his dog just below the one of the angel of death on his shoulder. Lou sheds a tear for most things. The dead racoons we’re always finding by the backdoor with their hands missing. Whenever there’s a new missing poster plastered over the cracked glass of the phone booth in the parking lot. Every time he hears I Will Forever Hate Roses when it decides to pop up on the jukebox. Big guy, bigger heart. \n\n“Always tired,” Jones said as I poured. Another girl had gone missing yesterday. As I poured, I made sure to brush his thumb where it rested on the cup handle with the inside of my wrist, lifting out that sadness as far as I could. He smiled up at me, shy, and I smiled back before I could stop myself. \n\nI walked on to the next booth, two truckers with faces that had seen too much sun. One was showing the other the photos of his new baby in his wallet. He had tobacco stained teeth, a scab on his cheek and wind-chapped lips - and his smile was the most beautiful damn thing as he talked about his kid, lit up like christmas morning. He showed me too as I refilled his coffee, and I stayed and talked to them a while. \n\nThe other trucker, with gold back teeth, told me how he’d used to drive pigs, but couldn't handle the guilt when he handed them over to the slaughterhouse. Said he’d look right into their pink faces through the slats and their eyes looked right back, bright and pleading like they knew what he’d done. Said he still dreamt about them. Now he drove freezers of seafood, specialty deliveries for fancy hotels. He’d never seen the ocean. \n\nLou slammed the bell from the depths of the kitchen and I got back to work, taking orders from a woman with a Labrador who ordered hot dogs for them both, and three teenage boys in their blood-stained varsity jackets in the corner, who had ten dollars between them and asked for as many waffles as they could get. \n\nThey often came in on full moons, leaving their bikes chained up in the parking lot. They were always hunting something, with their baseball bats, backpacks filled with bullets and their daddies’ guns, but they were nice kids so I always gave them extra scoops of ice-cream. Besides, I knew they needed the energy, because when they were hunting they had to run fast. Real fast. There used to be four of them. \n\nI cleared the table from the two women at the next booth on my way back. They looked to be twins, both dressed in long silk skirts and hiking boots, red hair piled up messy on top of their heads. \n\nNeither acknowledged me, not out of rudeness but because they were too preoccupied, packing up their bags, overspilling with maps and notebooks. I spied a roll of duct tape and a bottle of vodka in there too, along with some stakes and crucifixes. They were deep in conversation, waving their hands and I caught a little of it as I stacked their empty glasses, lipsticked round the rims. \n\n“I know where I buried him Sylvia-,”\n“You don’t know jackshit! We dug for hours, and-”\n\nMy mom always taught me eavesdropping was rude, so I left them to it and headed into the kitchen. But I got the sense that wherever they had left, whoever he was, he certainly wasn’t there no more. I felt like telling them, but like my mom said, it’s not polite to listen to other people’s conversations. You never know what you’ll wish you hadn’t heard. \n\nLou was dancing to the radio, swaying his hips to Sugar Hill as Dolly sang down the wires. He waved at me with the spatula he was using as a microphone. \n\nCarlos handed me a plate of pancakes. \n\nCarlos had worked here so long he’d known my Mom, and was the only one who new my real name. He sometimes came with me on the weekends to change the flowers on her grave. He always brought her desert flowers, growing from the same earth she was. Carlos was also the only one who knew the recipe for the Lucky’s pancakes, and the only one that could cook them right. On days when he wasn’t working, we had no pancakes. Simple as. That was just the way it went. I’d learnt that the hard way, but that’s another story. \n\nAlong with the pancakes, came a warning. \n\n“He’s back.” He gestured through the doors. “Table 6.” \n\nOur final regular had showed. It had been a while since he’d been around. I hadn’t even seen him come in, but that wasn’t unusual. He moved in mysterious ways. I raised an eyebrow. Shit. Carlos raised one back. Oh shit. He tossed me the salt with a grimace, and I filled the pockets of my apron. Lou banged around in one of the staff lockers for a moment, until he emerged triumphant, waving a bible that had definitely seen better days. He placed in on the counter next to the syrup jugs and flipped to a random page. \n\nWe leant over his huge shoulders to read what it said. “Keep far from a false charge, and do not kill the innocent and righteous, for I will not acquit the wicked.” Lou shrugged and patted me on the shoulder.\n\nI don’t get paid enough for this shit. \n\nI took the pancakes to table 6, which had been empty the last time I’d looked. It was now very much occupied. The man sat at table 6 was smiling as I walked over. If you could call it a smile. It was more like rictus, lips straining deep red at the corners of his face. His eyes kept darting from side to side, too fast to count, like his pupils couldn't make up their mind where they should be. His hands shook as I got closer, hovering like flies on a carcass.  \n\nI tried to lean as far away from him as I could as I placed the plate on the tabletop, but as I pulled my hands away he darted his neck out fast, whipping his head up and tilting his face towards me. He sniffed in, hard, eyelids fluttering. He giggled, shrill like it was stuck on the roof of his mouth. I recoiled, trying to hide the urge I had to run back to the kitchen. There’s something about hearing a grown man giggle that makes the skin crawl. \n\n“Can I get you anything?” I asked, faking bright. \n\n“I’d take your name.” He gripped one of the pancakes in his fist, turning it to mush. \n\nI tapped the name tag on my uniform. He shook his head, grinning, shoulders almost vibrating with this strange fluid roll as his smile slipped for a second, front teeth jutting suddenly, tongue sharply poking out. Filth was caked under his nails, red like the dirt on the sides of the road. Then he was smiling again, swaying slowly from side to side, feral, in his hunting jacket. His hair hung in greasy strings around his ears, like blonde rattails, and they swung with him, back and forth. \n\n“Isabella, Isabella, Isabella. It don’t suit.” He suddenly slammed his hand up to his face, shovelling the crushed pancake into the gaping hole of his wide mouth. I jerked back, the movement was so sudden. I shoved my hands into my apron, reaching for the salt, and his eyes narrowed. \n\n“There’s no need for that,” came a voice from behind me. It rolled across my shoulders, deep, to the bone. Mr Prince. \n\nI turned to face our third regular, relief mixing with fear in a swirling pit in my chest. Kinda like that feeling you get at a fairground in midsummer, when you’ve been on a carousel too long, and part of you knows you need to get off, but the other part doesn’t want to leave because you know as soon as you stand still you’re gonna be sick. Mr. Prince had that effect on people. \n\nMr. Prince was dressed, as always, in his black pinstripe. His stetson was darker than the night outside, and his boots shone like they were wet. If you didn’t notice the upside down crucifixes embroidered daintily onto his custom lapels, you’d think he was just a man with money, maybe mixed up in something a little shady, like oil, or pharmaceuticals. He was handsome by the way of his jaw, with his bone white smile, but his black sunglasses were balanced on the bridge of his nose, silver rimmed and gleaming, hiding his eyes as usual. When he spoke it was a drawl, dragged up from the depths of the South. \n\n“I’m sorry for my… acquaintance. He’s a little…” Mr Prince glanced at the man sat at table 6 as he panted with his tongue hung out, like a dog. “…over excited.” Mr Prince sat down and the lights above the booth flickered. He tilted his hat back on his head and the jukebox coughed and skipped, and suddenly Robert Johnson was on and singing about that damn crossroad again. Mr Prince popped a Marlboro Red between his teeth, and pushed the window open a sliver with the knuckles of his left hand. The silver pentagram ring on his wedding finger clacked against the glass.  \n\nMr. Prince smiled, the way snakes do when they’re watching you from the grass on their bellies. The cigarette was now smoking between his teeth, although he hadn’t moved. \n\n“Besides, Leroy ain’t the type for salt. He’s just a man.” He looked him up and down and his top lip curled. “Barely.” He turned to Leroy. “I see you started on my pancakes. But what’s the point of good food if it ain’t for sharing.” Leroy giggled that strange high sound that made me want to run, and shook a little. Everything about Leroy made me nervous, fight or flight getting ready to flood my system. \n\nMr Prince handed Leroy a menu. “Order whatever you want.” He leant forward and the lights flickered.\n\nLeroy ordered four cheeseburgers, and glass of milk. “Well, if that’s all!” I managed. I could feel Leroy’s eyes clinging to my back as I left. Rose-Marie waved me over before I could get back to the safety of the kitchen. \n\n“I wouldn’t worry about him, darlin’.” She crossed herself, and tapped the card on top of the pile. The Jack of Spades. It had its eyes scratched out. But not by Rose-Marie. It looked like it had been printed that way for years. “We won’t be seeing him again.” She wasn’t talking about Mr. Prince. She cupped my cheek and I leant into it, her hand rough with age, but warm. I could tell she thought I looked tired. She paid for her tea and toast, and walked out into the warm night waiting outside the doors.  \n\nI finally made it back into the kitchen and was immediately attacked. Cold water doused me in the face and I threw up my arms on instinct, trying to protect my hair. Lou aggressively squirted me in the face with the spray bottle we also kept in the staff locker, the kind you use for tending house plants. Ours was filled with holy water. \n\n“Lou! Jesus fuckin’ Christ, get off I’m-“ I sputtered, and he sprayed me again. I spat holy water out, dripping down the front of my dress and wiped it from my eyes, makeup running a little. I grabbed the bottle from his hands. “I think I’m good.” I wasn’t really mad though, better safe than sorry, especially when it comes to possession. \n\n“Sorry! Just checkin’.” Lou sheepishly handed me a dish towel. “Already did me ’n’ Carlos.” He looked down at his shoes, awkward. He was a foot taller than me and a decade older, and I hid my smile because he was twisting the toe of his boot back and forth like a little kid been kept after class.\n\nCarlos kept his eyes firmly fixed on his hands as he started flipping patties, but I could sense him holding back a laugh, desperately clenching his teeth. I narrowed my eyes and aimed the spray bottle at him. “Maybe you need some more,” I threatened. Lou snorted and then Carlos was laughing and I was too, and that heavy feeling that had hovered over us since Mr. Prince had walked in lifted. \n\nSometimes when things get too dark, all you can do is laugh. Mom always said that when shit gets rough, you can either choose to laugh or cry. I never saw my mother cry.\n\nIt was coming up on 3 in the morning as I took the burgers back to table 6. Leroy visibly drooled and clapped his hands as I walked over. I put the plate in front of him as quick as I could but as I pulled back, his head darted forward and he licked the inside of my wrist. His tongue was long and wet against my pulse. I recoiled like I’d been bitten and he laughed, shrill and manic. \n\n“You taste better than they will,” he said, grinning and gesturing to the burgers. Mr. Prince watched this unfold, calm and unreadable like the sky before summer lighting burns down a tree. I frantically wiped my arm on my apron, but I could still feel that tongue on my skin as if I’d left my hand in his mouth. I fought off the tears that suddenly burned at the corners of my eyes, because something told me Leroy would enjoy them just a little too much. I shuddered, and cleared Mr. Prince’s plate.\n\n“Tell Carlos the pancakes were… good as hell,” he said, from behind his sunglasses. Then he chuckled, low and raspy, as if something he’d said was funny. He popped another Marlbro between his teeth and it started to glow, as Leroy shovelled meat down his throat. I tried not to gag as I watched it clog beneath his long nails.\n\nI walked by Jones on my way back. He waved me over, eyes creased with worry. He ran a hand over his face, as if he was trying to wipe all the bad things away.\n\n“Is he botherin’ you?” He gestured over to Leroy who was rocking back and forth drinking his milk. Jones suddenly looked so tired, uniform creased as his face, looking fifty instead of his twenty two.\n“Nothing I can’t handle,” I shook my head and thought about Rose-Marie. “We won’t be seeing him again.” \n\nIt felt like hours waiting for Leroy to finish. I took the order of a man with a butterfly tattooed on his neck, and some truckers pouring Jim Beam into their coffee. They asked me for an extra cup which they placed at the empty seat on their table, for absent friends, they said. I cleaned down the counter top, restocked the sugar packets, and took out the trash, ignoring the man in the rabbit mask that often waits out by the dumpsters. As long as you don’t look at him, he doesn’t bother you. I refilled coffee cups, and took the orders of the large group of biker girls that came in, leather clad and road weary. \n\nAt 3:03am, Mr. Prince stood. Leroy had licked his plate clean and was sitting still, staring up at him with his teeth bared in a smile, hands gripping the table top so hard his knuckles were going white as milk. Mr. Prince handed me a roll of bills wrapped in black plastic that I knew better than to count. He tipped his hat. \n\n“See Leroy. We all gotta pay eventually,” he said. He leaned in and spoke softly. “For I will not acquit the wicked,” he smiled. He held out his hand to Leroy, palm flat, waiting. Leroy’s hands shook as he reached into his hunting jacket and pulled out a pair of shoes. A child’s shoes, small enough that both could fit in one hand. Little pink sneakers, dirty, with brown stains on the toes that I knew could only be one thing. Mr Prince considered them a moment, under the lights, and shook his head. \n\nHe seemed like he was sorry, before he handed them to me. “For your man over there. Tell him to dig deeper where they looked last.”  He nodded to Jones, who was watching us, his badge gripped in his hand. But Jones knew better than to come over. \n\nMr. Prince turned to Leroy and grinned around his cigarette. “We’ve got a ways to go, the road we’re takin’. They say it’s paved with good intentions.” He chuckled, and I felt sick to my stomach. He took Leroy’s hand, like a child, and they walked out into the night, warm and waiting. The doors swung shut behind them, even though nobody had touched them. The jukebox sputtered, and Chris Rea was on, singing about that road again. \n\nI placed the shoes on the table by Jone’s empty coffee cup, and passed on the message. He sat still for a long time after, just watching them on the table top, trying not to cry or scream or punch a hole in the plaster. All I could do was refill his coffee, because when someone is trying to hold themselves together like that, there’s nothing left to say. \n\nMy shift ended, and I drove myself home, following the taillights in front of me. I knew when I woke up it would be dark, and it would be time for my next shift, but for now, I just drove, dreaming about the ocean and watching the sun come up, like it always does, despite everything."},"289":{"title":"I’ve Been Flying for almost Thirty Hours and The Flight Attendants Won’t Stop Crying [Part 3]","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/dmyq8g\/ive_been_flying_for_almost_thirty_hours_and_the\/","flair":"Series","author":"Worchester_St","selftext":"[Read Part 1 Here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/dlk100\/ive_been_flying_for_almost_thirty_hours_and_the\/?st=k269q0gn&sh=f6440917)\n\n[Read Part 2 Here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/dm86h5\/ive_been_flying_for_almost_thirty_hours_and_the\/?st=k269q1qh&sh=b655a8d9)\n\nAfter another dozen hours or so, I opened the bathroom door. The lights in the cabin were back to normal and I couldn’t smell any sulfur. \n\nI cautiously made my way back to my seat and almost cried when the grinning crying flight attendant came by offering a meal. That crappy airline food was the most delicious thing I’d ever eaten. \n\nWhen I’d finished, my mind immediately turned to Mary. What had happened to her?\n\nI crept down the aisle towards first class, trying to keep a low profile. Surprisingly, the flight attendants were nowhere to be seen. They’d almost seemed to ignore me, almost as if they wanted me to find her.\n\nShe had a row to herself and was staring down at her phone in the window seat. I slid into the aisle and shook her arm. \n\n“Mary!” I hissed.\n\nShe pulled out her headphones and stared at me with a surprised expression. “Yeah? What’s going on?”\n\n“Are you ok?” I asked. “What did that thing do to you? What did they do to you?”\n\n“I’m sorry, remind me how I know you?”\n\n“What do you mean? We just-” I realized with sinking horror that she had no idea who I was. I fought back tears. “Mary, how long have you been on this flight?”\n\nShe checked the watch on her wrist. “Well it’s 4:03 AM so a few hours at least.” She stared at me the same way you’d look at a person claiming they were the second coming of Christ. Her tone was low and reassuring. “Hey, don’t worry so much. Look on the bright side; we’ll be landing in about an hour.”\n\nI felt an iron grip on my arm and looked up to see two flight attendants. “Sir, this area is for first-class passengers only.” \n\nThey were still crying and grinning, but just with tears this time. I could still see streaks of blood staining the front of their uniforms though. \n\nI was escorted back to my seat where I spent the next several days. Attendants continued to stop by with food, I would use the bathroom, and soon was going absolutely crazy with the monotony. \n\nIn retrospect, those few days weren’t so bad. There’s a lot of content on the internet after all, even with crappy plane WiFi. No, it didn’t get really bad until around ten days later when the WiFi failed.\n\nIt was sometime a week later that I lost control and began screaming for a flight attendant. They didn’t come for several minutes, but eventually one did.\n\n“Just...just let me see the Captain,” I asked.\n\nThe flight attendant bent low and spoke with that same customer-service voice: “I’m sorry sir, the captain has made his decision regarding you quite clear. You didn’t answer his call, and will, therefore, wait.”\n\n“How long?”\n\n“Quite a while I’m afraid. Don’t worry though sir, we’ll be landing in about an hour.” She straightened and walked away.\n\nI started making notches on various parts of the seatback to keep track of different things. One notch for each time I used the bathroom, one for each meal, one for every time I watched a given movie, that sort of thing. \n\nIt was hell. I watched every movie in the seatback a dozen times over. If I ever acted out badly enough, I would be escorted back to my seat by one or more flight attendants. Any attempt at conversation with other passengers was met with confusion by them followed by a quick escort back to my seat.\n\nI’d guess it was on or around day thirty that, in a moment of panic and psychosis, I broke my laptop and phone, screaming at the top of my lungs. No one around me reacted in any way. \n\nTwo months later, I stunk. The muscles in my legs were tight and cramped constantly. I finally concluded that suicide was my only option after my hundred-and-twenty-eight rewatch of Thor Ragnarok. \n\nI got to my feet and limped towards the emergency exit. I knew normally the pressure inside the airplane forced the doors closed, but I figured that nothing about my situation was normal. If this didn’t work, I’d find some other more painful way to go. \n\nI grabbed at the handle and swung it up. To my shock, the door opened easily, though no wind of any kind whipped around the cabin. It remained the standard slightly-too-cold temperature that it’d been for the past who-knew how long. \n\nThe open door called to me, a black portal out of the plane. I stared at it for a long moment, almost too long. An attendant’s hand grabbed my shoulder, pulling me away. In a fit of anger and strength that surprised me, I wrenched away and jumped out of the plane. \n\nThe wind whipping past my face was almost magical, a new sensation after so many months of the same. The ocean below me grew closer and larger, and I realized that suddenly, I didn’t want to die after all. \n\nIt grew larger and larger and larger until it seemed that all I could see was darkness and waves.\n\nI impacted the surface of the water so fast and hard that my entire body jerked around in the seat. I pulled my hand back, sucking at my bruised knuckle. I’d hit it on the seat in front of me.\n\n“No,” I whispered. Then shouted. “NO! NO! NO!”\n\nA flight attendant ran down the aisle, kneeling beside me. “Are you OK sir?”\n\nI clenched my hands into fists, almost swinging at her. But then I realized. \n\nShe wasn’t grinning.\n\nShe wasn’t crying. \n\nTo be honest she looked a little scared of me.\n\nI reached my right hand down to my pocket where I could feel my now-unbroken phone. \n\n4:04 AM.\n\n“Sir, if you can calm down we’ll be landing in about an hour.”\n\nMy mouth tasted like ash. “Thank you,” I managed. “I will.”\n\nI stared unblinking at my phone. It now displayed 4:05 AM.\n\nThen I looked out my window and began to cry at the sight of city lights below me. \n\nWe did land in about an hour. I can’t even begin to explain why or how, but I’m currently sitting in an airport cafe typing this out. I’m free. I’m out.\n\nAnd I’m never going flying again.\n\n---------------------------\n\n---------------------------\n\n\nEDIT: I sure hope the bartender here at the airport just has a naturally wide grin.\n\n---------------------------\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n[Want more?](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WorchesterStreet\/comments\/gbpc8t\/a_huge_storm_swept_through_my_town_a_week_ago_it\/)"},"290":{"title":"When we turn 18, we get the name of our soulmate.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/nmax25\/when_we_turn_18_we_get_the_name_of_our_soulmate\/","flair":"Series","author":"thewackwaffle","selftext":"[Part I](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/nmax25\/when_we_turn_18_we_get_the_name_of_our_soulmate\/) || [Part II](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/nqtu23\/when_we_turn_18_we_get_the_name_of_our_soulmate\/) || [Final](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/nvzhya\/when_we_turn_18_we_get_the_name_of_our_soulmate\/)\n\nI was young when I realized that the place I lived was special.\n\nI didn’t realize it at first, since I had lived there my whole life. I thought it was normal for a city to not allow pets. I grew up never hearing the sounds of barking dogs, or hissing cats. No one that lived inside the city border was allowed to have them.\n\nI thought it was normal for cities to have mandatory blood testing every week, with no explanation or seemingly any reason.\n\nI thought it was normal for cities to not have any jails.\n\nI thought it was normal for cities to give their citizens soulmates.\n\nI never really understood how it worked. All that we were told was that there were the Matchmakers, who were responsible for making the matches, and sending out the tiny slips of paper that determined each citizen’s love life, and future. No one ever saw the Matchmakers. No one knew how they were recruited, no one knew how they worked. All anyone knew was that it worked.\n\nWhere I lived, there has never been a filing for divorce. The Matchmakers are never wrong.\n\nEach citizen received their paper on their 18th birthday. Inside the piece of paper, there was nothing except a name. The name of your supposed soulmate. There was no telling how you would come across this person, no when or how. All anyone knew was that it would eventually happen. We were allowed to tell other people, allowed to ask around, try and seek out people that had the same name as the one on the paper, but it didn’t matter. It couldn’t be forced.\n\nOf course, literal eternal love and happiness does not come without rules. Every citizen had to follow the Rules. They weren’t too strange, and seemed like a small price to pay for what you were getting in return. Most of the rules were simple. To name a few, there was no going outside, under any circumstances, after 2am. No pets, blood tests, etc. There were also rules that we weren’t allowed to know until we were older.\n\nWe got the new rules on our 18th birthday, the same day we got our Matchmaker paper. We called them Slips.\n\nAs I got older, I realized that our city was special, and that other cities didn’t have what we had, but I didn't care. Life was good, life seemed simple. Our city was like a little paradise. It was happy. It was without issue.\n\n||\n\nIt was the night before my 18th birthday, and I couldn’t sleep. This was to be expected, since knowing that the next morning, you would know the name of your literal *soulmate* was enough to keep anyone up late.\n\nUsually, I wouldn’t have believed in such things like soulmates, especially as I got older, but it was hard to argue with evidence. My parents had gotten married in their late 20s, and have stayed happily married ever since, both of their names matching what was on their Slips. My older sister Katlin got her Slip last year, and though she’s been through her fair share of failed relationships, she’s currently in a happy one with some guy named Roger. I don’t think I need to tell you the name that was on her Slip.\n\nI wished Katlin still lived with us. We used to share a room, but ever since she moved out, it feels empty with just me in it. By some miracle, I eventually fell asleep, my brain finally exhausted after hours of wondering what tomorrow was going to bring.\n\nI woke up the next morning, my arm groping for my alarm to turn it off, just like any other day. It wasn’t until I sleepily sat up that I realised that today wasn’t like any other day.\n\nI swung my legs out of bed, my heart pounding in my chest as I tried to compose myself. I wanted to pull on a shirt and shorts as fast as possible, rush to the kitchen to get the envelope I knew would be addressed to me, but I didn’t. I didn’t want to be one of those people who’s entire lives suddenly revolved around trying to find their soulmate. I needed to be calm.\n\nTaking a few even breaths, I slowly put on a shirt and some basketball shorts, before opening my door. Chatter, and the smell of waffles hit my senses instantly as I stepped out of my room. Turning the corner, I stopped, grinning.\n\n“Katlin!” I said, unable to contain my excitement at seeing her. Reaching her in a few short steps, I wrapped my arms around her in a hug, to which she enthusiastically returned. “What are you doing here?” I said, pulling myself away to look at her.\n\n“Aw, you seriously thought I would miss your birthday? Get real.” She said, matching my grin as she looked at me. “*Damn* you got tall.” She said, looking at me. “He got it from his old man.” My dad chimed in, and Katlin rolled her eyes. Besides my height, I got a lot from my dad. I got his warm brown eyes, and I got his wavy, dirty blonde hair that I had always kept medium-length. I looked so much like my dad that my mom always chimed in saying how I got her nose and smile.\n\n“Happy birthday hon.” My mom said from the counter, giving me a soft smile. “These are almost done, and we’ll go out for your birthday dinner later tonight.” She said, gesturing at the waffles, and I smiled. “Birthday waffles for the birthday boy.” My dad chimed in, putting an arm around my mom, and the simple movement made me remember something I forgot in the midst of the excitement. “Is it- is it here?” I asked them, trying to keep my voice even.\n\nMy sister nodded, understanding what I was talking about. “On the front table.” My legs felt like rubber as I walked the few steps into the hallway, instantly seeing the stark white envelope on the table. I picked it up.\n\n*| Deliver to: Theodore Shillings |*\n\nI walked back to the kitchen, all eyes on me as I turned the envelope over, trying to act calm, act normal.\n\nI opened the envelope, pulling out two pieces of paper. One of them, I knew would be the new rules. The other one, was my Slip. I looked at the bigger paper first.\n\n*To people(s) registered as 18 years as older, the following rules will come into effect.*\n\n1. *Under no circumstances is anyone 18 years or older permitted in city waters. This includes all local rivers within city limits.*\n2. *Under no circumstances will anyone 18 years or older be allowed to watch the television on the 14th of every month.*\n3. *Under no circumstances is anyone 18 years or older permitted to use faucets after 12am. This includes sinks, bathtubs, and showers.*\n4. *Under no circumstances is anyone 18 years or older permitted to use any kind of elevator after 9pm.*\n5. *Under no circumstances is anyone 18 years or older permitted to share their rules with people(s) under the age of 18.*\n\nAnd that was it. I honestly expected more, but was relieved there wasn’t too many that I would have to memorize. They were weird, sure, but nothing that I wouldn’t be able to do. After re- reading the new Rules, I put the paper down, heart hammering as I took my slip. Wanting to get it over with, I opened it, to which a single name was printed.\n\n*Avery*\n\nI read, and re-read the name several times. Avery. Avery. *Avery.*\n\nI racked my brain for people I knew named Avery. There was a girl in my history class, and maybe one who I had pre calc with a few years ago? Before I could wonder further, Katlin’s voice cut me off. “What’s the name?” She said, to which I handed it to her. It passed from her, to my mother, then my father. “Avery. Nice name.” My dad said, handing my Slip back to me. Chatter resumed between my parents and Katlin, while my mind was whirring.\n\nSome things made more sense now, like why I never saw adults kayaking in the river like I saw them do in other cities. I had told myself for a long time that once I got my Slip, that I wouldn’t focus too much on it, but my mind kept coming back to the name that was burned into my mind. *Avery*.\n\nI still had to go to school, and got ready while Katlin went out to reconnect with some high school friends. I ignored my texts asking what the name on my Slip was, preferring to have that conversation in person.\n\nMy friends were waiting for me at the bus stop eagerly. There was Jennifer, who was usually pretty quiet, and who I’d known since preschool. There was Joseph, who was a bit of a daredevil and a jock who I’d met during my freshman year. Lastly, there was Charles and Sophia, twins who were never separated, and who I’d bonded with sophomore year over our love for horror movies. Looking at us as a group looked weird, but we worked, and had fun with each other.\n\nI was bombarded with the same question as I got close to them.\n\n“Who’s name did you get?”\n\n“Avery.” I said, the first time I had actually said the name. It sounded nice, coming out of my mouth, It sounded right. My friends nodded, followed by a moment of silence that meant that they were all trying to think of Avery’s that we knew.\n\n“Isn’t there a chick in your history class named Avery?” Joseph offered, and I nodded. “Yeah. I’m trying not to think about it too much, I don’t wanna become one of those people who become obsessed with it.” I said, although the name was really all I could think about.\n\nMy friends dropped it after that, all except Joseph. He would chime in every few minutes, rattling off girls that he knew, all with the name Avery. He was still talking about it as the bus came, and as we walked up to the school. He really didn’t have an “off” button, which meant that I was left to try and tune him out, nodding my head in agreement every few minutes.\n\nAs the school day went on, I couldn’t help but wonder if each Avery I came across was my soulmate. Somehow though, none of the girls I came across felt right.\n\nEverything else aside, the school day went pretty smoothly. People wished me happy birthday in the halls, occasionally asking who I got on my Slip.\n\nAfter school, I still had time before I had to head home and start working on homework, so as usual, I met outside the school with my friends. The day had gotten progressively hotter as it went on, and by the time school was let out, it had reached the point of uncomfort. Most of my friends were already waiting for me, and as I got closer they were already in conversation.\n\n“-balls hot man, we should go claim a spot by the river before it gets too crowded.” Joseph was saying, to which my other friends nodded in agreement. The river he was referring to was the biggest in the city, almost cutting it in half. It was a popular hangout spot, and my friends and I had been going there for ages. But now,  my throat felt tight. None of my friends had turned 18 yet, since I had an extra year of preschool when I was a kid. They didn’t know the new rules.\n\nOne of the rules said I wasn’t allowed to tell them. Did that mean I also couldn’t hint at it?\n\n“Er, I’m not sure if I’m feeling the river today.” I said, trying to sound as nonchalant as possible.\n\n“Are you crazy? It’s like, 90 degrees out here.” Jennifer said, raising her eyebrows. Not wanting to act suspicious, I decided that I would go, but I wouldn't go in. Under any circumstances.\n\n“Alright let’s go, but I can’t stay long, I have my birthday dinner with Katlin and my parents.” I said, to which Joseph pumped his fist.\n\nRelieved that none of them seemed to suspect anything, we set off towards the river.\n\nThere were a couple other families there, with kids playing in the shallow water and the parents sitting safely on the edge.\n\nI took a few, even breaths to remind myself that I was fine, and that I would stay on the shore. Jennifer and Joseph were the first to the river, instantly pulling up their jeans and taking off their socks and shoes as they dipped them into the river, sighing with the relief that the cool water provided from the hot weather.\n\nI desperately wanted to be there with them, swimming in the river and enjoying the nice weather, but the rules were very clear. I sighed, sitting down a few feet away from the water, my legs out in front of me, watching as my friends splashed each other with the water. I just had to hold out until they had their birthdays, and then I wouldn’t have to make excuses. I could handle a few more months. “Oi! Come on birthday boy, get in the water!” Charles yelled, splashing water in my direction as he was ankle deep in it, a few feet away from where it dropped off into deeper waters. I smiled, shaking my head as I adjusted my legs to make myself more comfortable. “Nah, I’ll be the one to drive you guys to the hospital when you get hypothermia.” I yelled back, to which I could see his eyes roll from here.\n\n“Aw, we can’t have that!” Joseph called, wading back to where I was. “I command the birthday boy to get hypothermia with the rest of us!” Joseph said, smirking as he approached me. I felt a trickle of unease as he approached me. I stood up to move away, but just then he swooped down and picked me up over his shoulder. Joseph played for the football team, and I always admired his strength, but this was the first time I was afraid of it. “Joseph, stop! Put me down!” I yelled, panic rising in my voice, struggling to escape his arms as he was carrying me to the water.\n\nMy heart pounded wildly in my chest, as a rising fear crept up my throat. He outmatched me in size and strength, and my struggles were fruitless. “I’m serious Joseph, put me the fuck down!” I yelled, to which he gave a little laugh. “You’re always so serious Theo, loosen up! Live a little!” He replied, and I could see he was in the water now, wading further in. I looked at my friends, wide eyed, but they were giggling like it was a joke.\n\nThey had no idea.\n\nAs he got closer to the drop off, I struggled harder, hitting him on the shoulders. I wasn't weak by any standards, but Joseph was built like an ox, almost all muscle. Fear closed my throat so tightly, I couldn't breathe. “ Come on, everyone in the water!\" He said, motioning with his head to my friends, who obliged, standing on the edge of the drop. \"Alright on three, we’ll all jump in together.” He put his hands on my waist, and I knew what was coming. “One…. two…..” He started, rocking back and forth. “Joseph, stop! STOP!” I yelled, punching him harder, but it didn’t make any difference.\n\n“Three!”\n\nI heard the splashes of my friends jumping in, just as I was launched a few feet into the air.\n\nI didn't know what to expect.\n\nI shut my eyes tightly as images rapidly flashed through my mind. I saw myself at my ninth birthday party, saw myself applauding at Kaitlin's graduation. Rapid images throughout my life flashed before me.\n\nWas my life flashing before my eyes?\n\nIt felt like an eternity before I hit the water.\n\nNothing could have prepared me for what happened next.\n\nI hit the water hard, the cold water stinging every part of my body. The wind knocked out of me, but since nothing else happened immediately, I thought, fleetingly, that I was fine.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nIt felt like a giant vacuum was at the bottom of the river, sucking me towards it. I thrashed in the water, desperately trying anything to prevent myself from getting sucked deeper. I had been swimming in the deep part of the river before, and one summer my friends and I actually measured how deep it was, and I knew well enough that I was being pulled far beyond that. I was running out of air, and my panicked state wasn't helping the situation.\n\nWhatever was down there started to pull me faster, as if whatever it was could sense my desperation. My chest felt tight, as I could no longer hold my breath. My body started to go limp when suddenly- I was falling.\n\nI was no longer in water, and I took a gasp of breath, sputtering out the water that had managed to get in my mouth from my surprise. I was so relieved to be breathing again, that it took me a minute to realize I was falling rapidly through the air. Darkness surrounded me, and through my confused, dazed state I couldn't make out what was around me. A few seconds later, for the second time during the day, my body hit water again, hard.\n\nOnce again, I had the wind knocked out of me, and I could feel myself sinking. I couldn't move, I couldn't breathe.\n\nI didn't have the energy to panic. My eyes closed. I didn't know what I was supposed to think about. I didn't want my last thoughts before death to be wasted.\n\nIt was during these last thoughts that suddenly, something pulled me away from them.\n\nLiterally.\n\nI could feel something grabbing the back of my shirt, pulling me upwards, towards the surface. Confusion swept me as a moment later, I felt myself being heaved out of the water, and being roughly set down, on something hard, something solid. I gasped, coughing and sputtering as water dripped off of me.\n\nI shakily pushed myself onto my hands and knees, trying to get my breathing under control, my thoughts moving at the speed of light. I felt oddly light-headed, my body drained and exhausted. I wanted to look around for my savior, but I couldn't. My vision had started to go black, as my exhausted body finally collapsed.\n\n||\n\nSomeone was shaking me awake. My first, fleeting thought that it was my mom, telling me I was going to be late for school. Then I remembered. It was just a dream. I told myself. Just a dream. You'll open your eyes and mom is going to wish you a happy birthday, tell you you're going to be late for school-\n\nSomeone shook me harder. I opened my eyes. It was not my mom.\n\nIt was a boy, who looked around my age with dark, messy hair and who was looking at me with two dark blue concerned eyes, who looked relieved as I opened my eyes. \"Good. You're awake. Come on, we need to move.\" He said quickly, looking behind him. Confusion clouded my mind. \"Who- who are you? And where am I?\" I said, trying to keep the fear out of my voice. The boy looked back at me. \"My name is Avery. I can explain everything later, but we really have to go.\"\n\nMy breath caught in my throat. Avery. Avery. Avery.\n\nOh, shit."},"291":{"title":"The terrifying note addressed to my six-year-old son","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/63m9pe\/the_terrifying_note_addressed_to_my_sixyearold_son\/","flair":"Series","author":"Creeping_dread","selftext":"My wife and I are beside ourselves right now. This is the type of thing you see in the movies, but now it’s happening to us.\n\nYesterday evening, a little after six, my wife and I were in the kitchen cooking dinner when my six-year-old (almost 7) son Kyle walked in from the back patio. He was holding a folded piece of paper in his hand and had a strange look on his face. My son is constantly drawing (and loves to read and write) so this usually wouldn’t have stood out to me at all, but he’d just come in from hitting the baseball off the tee and really had no reason to be holding a piece of paper. \n\nMy son is the type of kid who wears his emotions on his sleeve. When I asked to see the piece of paper, I could tell he didn’t really want to give it to me because he flashed his typical *I’m gonna be in trouble if I do* face. I insisted, and he finally handed it over. Here’s what it said:\n\n>Dear Kyle,\n\n>I know this note may sound scary,\n\n>(your daddy will think it is),\n\n>but grownups don’t know \n\n>how friendships can grow\n\n>when kids are just left to be kids.\n\n>And what a kid you’ve become, Kyle!\n\n>You’re growing as fast as a weed.\n\n>Last night off the tee\n\n>you stroked it for three\n\n>and your team took a two-run lead!\n\n>Yes, I’ve been watching (a while now, its true).\n\n>I think we would make perfect friends.\n\n>You’re a kid through and through,\n\n>And I am one too,\n\n>even if just for pretends.\n\n>The problem, I fear, is your parents.\n\n>(I doubt they would let us hang out).\n\n>One is just rude,\n\n>the other a prude,\n\n>church-going, pure, holy, devout.\n\n>I’ve got an idea\n\n>(can you tell my hand’s shaking?)\n\n>for me and you getting together!\n\n>Tomorrow at three,\n\n>you can come and see me\n\n>at the address attached to this letter.\n\n>But please (pretty please!)\n\n>don’t tell your dad!\n\n>Your mom and he won’t understand.\n\n>Just come by yourself,\n\n>I’ll be dressed as an elf!\n\n>And we can even hold hands!\n\n>Would you like that?\n\n>(You will! You really will Kyle!)\n\n>We will have (my oh my) so much fun!\n\n>So I’ll see you at three,\n\n>by the sycamore tree,\n\n>where our two kindred souls become one!\n\nThere was an address scribbled at the bottom of the page.\n\n>3 Orange Circle.\n\nI knew immediately it wasn’t a prank. \n\nCarrie, my wife, is the youth group leader at our church. And Kyle did just have a tee ball game last night. Orange Circle is only one street over from our street, and I'm pretty sure lot 3 is the corner lot on the culdesac, which has an empty house with a large sycamore tree in the backyard. \n\nWas this sicko really watching Kyle’s game? What would have happened I hadn’t seen him with the letter?\n\nI shouted for my wife to come read it. When she did, she flipped out, and ran for the phone to call the police. \n\nI flipped the note over, and on the back was some more text. I couldn’t read it at first, but quickly realized it was written backwards, I’m guessing so Kyle couldn’t have read it. To read it, I had to hold it up in front of a mirror:\n\n>And now (just in case)\n\n>if your Dad’s reading this,\n\n>it’s time to tell him a story.\n\n>If your mom flaps her hole\n\n>Or your dad tells a soul,\n\n>I’m afraid things might get rather gory. \n\n>On the 10th of July, \n\n>1995,\n\n>A woman named Susie went missing,\n\n>Susie, you see,\n\n>(unlike you and me)\n\n>wasn’t careful about who she’d been kissing.\n\n>I kept her a while (but old things get so boring!)\n\n>and in time I had gotten my fill.\n\n>I threw her away\n\n>and to my great dismay\n\n>the hunger I felt plagued me still.\n\n>I tried to bury it deep down inside\n\n>(where nothing down there can escape).\n\n>But lately it seems\n\n>I see Kyle in my dreams\n\n>And that hunger can no longer hide.\n\n>Now that you know what I’m capable of\n\n>(more than both of you can comprehend),\n\n> if one word is spoken,\n\n>then children get broken,\n\n>and Susie will have a new friend.\n\nThe police arrived in a half hour and we showed them the note. They told us to stay inside and lock the doors for the remainder of the night. The man had obviously been in our (fenced-in) back yard, which made me sick to my stomach and had me cursing myself for not installing the security camera I’d gotten for Christmas. \n\nNothing happened last night, thank God.\n\nThis morning, I got a call from the detective assigned to our case. He’d reviewed the list of missing persons cases from 1995 and something had turned up. \n\nSuzanne Kerrington went missing July 10th, 1995, just as the note said. The last person to see her alive was a friend who saw her at the 24-hour gym they attended together. Susie had said she’d met someone new and wanted to get a quick workout in before getting ready for their second date. Susie was never seen again and the man was never identified. \n\nAnd, maybe the worst part, was Suzanne's address. \n\n3 Orange Circle. \n\nI'm supposed to meet with the detective later this evening. \n\nWhat should we do?\n\nUPDATE: The detective just called back. They're sending an unmarked patrol car with two plainclothes officers to 3 Orange Circle at 3 p.m. today. Kyle's teachers have been notified and he's safe at school and won't be going to recess today. I'll update tomorrow with any news.\n\n[Update 1](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/63uu1m\/the_terrifying_note_addressed_to_my_sixyearold\/)\n\n***\n\n[Download the FREE audiobook!](https:\/\/gumroad.com\/l\/RRPSp)\n"},"292":{"title":"Under The Back Porch","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/8zb8k9\/under_the_back_porch\/","flair":null,"author":"theoddcatlady","selftext":"As a kid I lived with neglectful parents at best. At worst dad would turn his screams and fists on me but I learned quickly how to dodge the worst of it. Mom wasn’t much help, she’d just smoke in the kitchen and bitch at him for staying out so late.\n\nAt the time we lived basically in the middle of nowhere, our nearest neighbors were a long walk away for a six year old and we had trees between us. No one to run to for help. But I was pretty small for a kid my age. I learned I could fit pretty much anywhere. The closet. Dryer. I think even once I tucked myself under my futon in such a way I could still get some air but no one could see me.\n\nI was a master at hiding. But it wasn’t for a good reason.\n\nOne night though, one night I chose to do something different.\n\nI could hear it in dad’s yells, he was pissed and was about to get violent. Mom wasn’t helping either, just piling fuel onto an inferno of a flame. So I knew I had to find a good hiding spot. I’d gotten the idea a few days before, when I realized the lattice covering the bottom half of the back porch had a hole in it. Not big enough to fit a full grown man, most likely, but it could fit a skinny six year old no problem.\n\nSo wrapping myself up in my blanket and grabbing my hippo stuffie, I snuck out my window and ran into the backyard. In the middle of autumn. When it was forty degrees out and the temperature was steadily dropping.\n\nI crawled under the porch, scraping my elbows and getting splinters in my palms but I fit inside. It was actually quite spacious compared to most my hiding spots, I couldn’t sit up all the way but I had plenty of room to spread out my limbs.\n\nOf course I was also getting covered in dirt. It’d rained a few days ago so the mud was still a little wet. I wrapped myself in my blankie the best I could and settled in for the night.\n\nBut soon, even with my blankie and my hippo, my teeth were chattering so hard I could barely breathe. I didn’t want to go back inside though, knowing if my dad caught me I’d be in for the whipping of my life. So I had to tough it out.\n\n“Honey, are you cold?”\n\nThat voice was not the voice of my mother, scratchy from all the smoking and screeching she did. It was sweet, like honey. I turned over to see the dim outline of a woman, lying on her stomach next to me. She had a pretty butterfly necklace and was just as dirty as I was.\n\nI nodded, not wondering how she’d been down there without me noticing.\n\nThe woman belly crawled forward and wrapped her arms around me and suddenly I became warm. Like I was sitting next to a campfire. I snuggled into her arms, not minding the mud, after all we were both dirty.\n\n“You’ve gotten so big,” the woman said, examining my face. “How old are you now, Alex?”\n\n“Six.” How did I know this woman again? I didn’t think I did.\n\n“Six!” The woman gasped. “You’re all grown up then. I’m so happy.” She sighed pleasantly and stroked my hair. I’d never felt so cozy in my life.\n\n“What’s your name?” I asked.\n\nShe smiled, I could hear it in her voice. “I’m Lily. What’s your favorite thing to do?”\n\nI had to think for a second. “I like board games. And coloring.”\n\nLily chuckled. “Just like me then. Could never get enough of Scrabble. But I guess you’re still too young to play that, huh?”\n\nI nodded. “Lotsa words. I wanna play it though. I like the tiles. Would you play with me?”\n\nI heard Lily sharply inhale. “I… I don’t think I can. Your daddy put me under here, and I can’t leave… but…” She thought for a second. “Alex, could you do me a favor?”\n\n“Of course!” This lady was oh so nice. Why wouldn’t I do her a favor?\n\n“When you wake up in the morning, go to the police station. Ask for an officer by the name of Lowell Joyce. Tell him where to find Lily, okay? Under your back porch. He’ll come and he’ll get me, okay? And… and then maybe we can play Scrabble.”\n\nYippee! I was too excited about the possibility of playing Scrabble to notice how Lily’s voice caught at the end. I nodded vigorously. “I’ll do it! We can be on the same team, right?”\n\nLily softly laughed.\n\n“I’ll help you understand the rules. Goodnight, Alex.”\n\nWhen I woke up the next morning, I heard Lily’s voice.\n\n“Go now. Your dad’s gone to work. I’ll tell you how to get to the station.”\n\nRubbing my eyes, I crawled out from under the porch and went into the house to grab my shoes and a coat. I shivered in the frosty cold. But I thought Lily was right behind me.\n\nAfter my shoes and coat were on I started walking. It was long enough to get to the neighbor’s house. I really can’t remember how long it took to get to the police station, although I have no idea why no one pulled over to see what the hell a six year old in dirty pajamas was doing walking alongside the road. Lily kept guiding me onward.\n\n“Wait. Okay, cross the street now.”\n\n“Turn right here.”\n\n“Keep going! You’ve almost made it!”\n\nI nearly collapsed with exhaustion by the time I walked into the station. The guys out front chatting and having a good time didn’t see me until I almost made it to the front desk.\n\n“Whoa! Kid! You okay?” One of the officers knelt down to my level, eyes wide.\n\nI nodded. “I’m okay. Can I speak to Lowell Joyce?” I asked.\n\nOne of the other officers picked me up. “Sure kid, sure, let’s just get you someplace warm, holy shit your lips are blue…”\n\nI remembered quietly scolding the man about watching his language. ‘Shit’ was a bad word.\n\nI was given some warm cocoa and wrapped up in a blanket by the time an old man with a graying mustache sat by me.\n\n“Hey kid. I’m Sheriff Joyce. What’s your name?” He asked.\n\n“Alex.” I set down my cup and looked him straight in the eye. “I was told to tell you that Lily is under the back porch.  You need to go let her out so we can play Scrabble.”\n\nI had never seen a grown man turn pale before.\n\nLots of things blurred together at this point. I remember being taken back to my house and there were a lot of police cars and people around. The back porch was surrounded by yellow tape, and someone was taking a black bag away while my dad was in handcuffs.\n\nAfter that, I lived with my grandparents. Sheriff Joyce and his wife.\n\nI tried to ask about what happened and who was Lily but I always got shut down. I was too young to know.\n\nBut life got better. A lot better.\n\nGrandpa was the best man I could’ve hoped for in my life. We went out on weekends to the movies where he let me have the giant soda even though I’d have to pee in the middle of the movie. When I asked if I could drink when I was thirteen he let me try a beer. I spat it out and didn’t touch it again. He never judged me for my love of art, letting me paint my own bedroom multiple times over the years. I felt safe around him. He never laid a hand on me. My grandmother was amazing too, over the week she’d homeschool me along with teaching me things that you wouldn’t learn in a school, such as how to respect others but not take their crap. And cooking. Lots of cooking. I could make my own birthday cake by the time I was twelve. But I usually just made them for my friends. I got a lot of those, after I was free from my dad.\n\nWhen I turned sixteen, Grandpa took me back to my dad’s house.\n\nThe whole thing had been bulldozed over. But I could still see the yellow tape wound around a few trees, faded and torn.\n\nWe sat together on the back of his truck. He opened a beer and drank half of it before setting it down and grabbing me an orange soda.\n\nAfter I’d drank it he told me.\n\n“Lily was your mother.”\n\nGood thing he didn’t tell me as I was swallowing, I likely would’ve had it coming out of my nose. “My mom?” I questioned, confused.\n\n“Your actual mom. The woman who lived with your dad was not your mother.” My granddad grabbed another beer. “Lily was my daughter. I loved her so much… but when you were around six months old, she vanished.”\n\nMy stomach dropped. “My dad just imprisoned her under the porch?” I asked, starting to feel sick.\n\nGrandpa took a deep breath before setting his unopened beer down. “That’s…. something I’ve never been able to understand. Lily told you to find me? And that she loved Scrabble?”\n\n“Yeah. She kept me warm that night. I probably would’ve frozen to death if she hadn’t been there.” I was a stupid kid, even I knew that.\n\nGrandpa went dead quiet before he opened that beer and slammed the whole thing. “… Alex, Lily had been dead the whole time she was gone. When we dug her up she was bones. Experts confirmed it, and your dad confessed to what happened. They’d gotten into a fight and he threw her down the stairs. She… broke her neck.” He clenched his fists. “I knew he had something to do with her disappearance, but I never had proof until you walk into my station, covered in dirt and telling me she was under the porch.”\n\nI was floored. I couldn’t breathe. All I could do was shake my head.\n\n“But- I saw her! She was alive! She had this butterfly necklace…” I trailed off when Grandpa pulled an evidence baggie from his pocket.\n\nThere was that butterfly necklace all right. Rusty, and parts of the paint had chipped off, but I remembered it as clearly as I remembered Lily’s voice.\n\nGrandpa took a shaky breath as he pressed the bag into my hands. “… Lily loved you so much. ‘ts why she stuck around that bastard. You were her whole world. She was constantly taking pictures and sendin’ them to us in the mail. Sometimes a mother’s love can accomplish things that no human can do.”\n\nMy eyes overflowed with tears as I clutched the necklace to my chest. Choking on sobs, I leaned against Grandpa. He held me tight and I swear I felt a few of his tears land on the top of my head.\n\nAnd for just a brief moment, I swear I felt that warm love I felt that night under the porch."},"293":{"title":"Every night, my girlfriend wakes me up to tell the exact same joke.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/vrdoja\/every_night_my_girlfriend_wakes_me_up_to_tell_the\/","flair":null,"author":"Point_Of_No_Return-","selftext":"Before i start, i feel like i should let something very clear: I absolutely love Ellen. We've been living together for about three years now, but have known each other our whole lives. In fact, we were childhood friends - and i know this may sound like a fairy tale to some people, but it truly felt like we were always destined to be together. Even after graduation, when we started dating other people, it only felt truly right when we were with each other. So i don't know what took me so long to ask her out, but i'm really glad i did.\n\nWe have the same taste in music, movies, and even food. We laugh at the same dumb jokes, and know exactly how to comfort each other in times of need. She's the kindest, most gentle and loving girl i ever met. We even been talking about our plans for marriage, and how we would like to have kids of our own. That's why it hurts so much how it all went terribly wrong, in just four nights.\n\nI would also like to preface that Ellen doesn't have much of a family other than me, and some very distant aunts that she never met and doesn't even know their names. I was born in a big family, with four siblings and plenty of cousins that were always visiting, and even helping out when we got in trouble. Ellen has none of that. She doesn't have any siblings, and her father was an alcoholic, abusive freak that died when she was young. Her mother was a very kind and inspiring person, that took care of the family by herself for many years. And almost a second mother to myself. So when she passed away last year, it hurt us both for a long time.\n\nBut Ellen stayed strong. She's not the type to let her feelings easily surface, so you gotta be a lot more perceptive to get what she truly feels. I used to proud myself in being capable of that. I felt like i knew her better than i knew myself. That's why this is all so strange, and frankly, terrifying.\n\nWe were sleeping in bed, and i was dreaming. I don't really remember what it was about, but for some reason i'm sure of it. Until i heard her voice, very close to my ear:\n\n*''Knock, knock. Knock, knock.''*\n\nShe was caressing my hair, gently, while sitting in bed and looking below at me.\n\nI slowly opened my eyes, groggy from sleep.\n\n''Hey... what is it, baby?''\n\nShe kept looking at me, fixated. And repeated:\n\n*''Knock, knock. Knock, knock.''*\n\nI glanced at the digital clock, on top of the dresser. *3:27 AM.* I had work in only a few hours.\n\n''What is it, Ellen?''\n\nShe paused. - ''Please answer the joke, dear. *Knock, knock. Knock, knock.''*\n\n''Fine.'' - I accepted, mostly because i was expecting some kind of surprise. Ellen wasn't the type to do what she was doing for no reason. - ''Who's there?''\n\nHer smile opened up, and she answered: ''*Not me. So don't answer the door.''*\n\nI kept looking at her, dumbfounded. What was that supposed to mean?\n\n''Is that it? Is that the joke?''\n\n''Yes'' - She said, laying in the couch and covering herself with a blanket. - ''Thank you for answering.''\n\n''Weirdo.'' - I answered, closing my eyes and going back to sleep.\n\nNext morning, things went as usual. I only remembered the strange conversation while i was alone in the bathroom, brushing my teeth, and wasn't even sure if it had truly happened or if it was just a weird dream. So we had our breakfast together, and she was acting normal, reading something aloud from a fashion magazine. Frankly, i wasn't paying much attention. So i took the opportunity to ask about last night.\n\nInitially, she didn't seem to know what i was talking about. Then her eyes fixated on me and the same smile from last night crossed her face, briefly. And i knew it wasn't just a dream. She told me it wasn't anything of importance, and stopped paying attention when i asked more inquisitively. And even though i shouldn't, i gave up. I had work and other matters to attend to, and just brushed off the weird event thinking it wouldn't happen again.\n\nBut the following night, i woke up to her voice.\n\n*''Knock, knock.'' -* A pause. - ''*Knock.''*\n\n''What is it now?'' - I said. - ''Ellen, what are you doing?''\n\n*''Knock, knock. Knock.'' -* She repeated.\n\nThis time, she wasn't even touching me. Just sitting in bed, looking at me with that same smile. But her eyes semeed larger, and she blinked in longer intervals. I looked at the clock. Once again, *3:27 AM.*\n\n''Ellen, c'mon. What is it? I got work in a few hours, can't have the luxury of waking up in the middle of the night to answer Knock Knock jokes.''\n\n''*Knock, Knock. Knock.''*\n\n''This is getting creepy, you know? I'm not sure if this is some gag you've been doing, but i don't like it.''\n\n''Answer it. *Knock, Knock. Knock.''*\n\nI sighed, but also let a small laugh escape. It was creepy, of course, but she was also my Ellen. So it didn't bother me as much as it should.\n\n''Fine. Who the fuck is there?'' - I answered in a playful tone.\n\n''*Not me. So don't answer the door.''*\n\nFor some reason, i felt a chill down in my spine. It was the same answer as before, and i still didn't get what it meant. But the way she said it, with a strange, monotone voice, contrasted well with her smile and the fact that i had no idea of what she meant by that.\n\n''What does that mean?'' - I asked. - ''I really don't get it.''\n\nShe just smiled, and went back to sleep. I felt a throb in my heart, but did the same.\n\nNext day, we talked again about what was happening. She was very evasive with my questions, and i barely got her to say anything. It was almost as if she couldn't talk about it, which was very strange, considering we talk about pretty much everything. I told her i needed to be well rested for work, something she should understand well, and wasn't liking her little gag every night. She just nodded. And i decided to not press further, as i didn't want to hurt her feelings and had work to attend to.\n\nWhen i got back home, we had dinner, watched a movie and went to bed.\n\n*''Knock, Knock''*\n\nI opened my eyes faster this time around. In fact, i barely got any sleep - i just knew she would do it again and kept thinking about it the whole time. Glanced at the clock: *3:27 AM.*\n\n*''Knock, Knock''*\n\nI thought about ignoring her. Just pretending i was asleep and she wouldn't wake me up. So i closed my eyes slowly, hoping that she hadn't seen me opening them in the first place, and stayed quiet.\n\n*''Knock, Knock''*\n\nShe continued. She didn't stop. I regulated my breathing, but she kept going.\n\n*''Knock, Knock''*\n\n''I'm not answering your fucking joke, Ellen. Stop it.''\n\n*''Knock, Knock''*\n\nI ignored but she kept going. She had never been this insistent with anything before. I tried to ignore it, but it was getting on my nerves, and frankly, i felt scared. Why was Ellen doing this? Why every night, at the same exact time down to the minute? Why wouldn't she let me sleep until i answered her?\n\n*''Knock, Knock''*\n\nI got up in a sudden movement.\n\n''God dammit, Ellen.'' - I was ready for a discussion, but when i finally glanced at her, it was as if the strength was drained from me.\n\nShe wasn't smiling. She wasn't blinking. Just staring right at me, fixated like an animal. And her mouth was moving, slowly, and she didn't stop. ''*Knock, Knock''.*\n\nI didn't know how to react, or what expression i had when i saw her but my heart skipped a beat. It was terrifying, as if her gaze froze me in place. A thousand-yard stare.\n\n*''Knock, Knock''*\n\n''Who's there?'' - I asked, feeling as if it was the only way out of that nightmare.\n\n*''Not me. So don't answer the door'' -* She said, weakly.\n\nEllen slowly closed her eyes and layed down. I kept staring at her while she fell into what seemed to be a deep sleep.\n\nI got up and and left. I walked downstairs and sat down at the couch in the living room, staring at the night sky outside and absorbing the quiet of the neighborhood. My heart was beating fast and it didn't slow down. I was too scared to sleep in the same room as my girlfriend, all because of a fucking Knock Knock joke. But it was unnatural. I thought about calling someone. I thought about it all being some kind of sleep-related issue, such as some type of sleep-walking. But it didn't make any sense.\n\nI felt so tired. And decided that early in the morning, i would call an old friend who's a psychologist and get the opinion of a professional. Something was wrong with Ellen.\n\nI stayed in the couch as the day rose, and once Ellen woke up, she was acting normal again. Even asked me why i wasn't in bed. I didn't answer. In fact, i didn't speak to her and simply left for work. She seemed very upset, but i wouldn't do anything about it. Once i got to work i called my friend, told him everything that was happening in as much detail as i'm describing now. He didn't seem as worried as i figured, but we agreed in making an appointment for next week. Now i just needed to convince Ellen to come with me.\n\nI received plenty of text messages from her. She seemed very worried, sad and even confused. She apologized a lot, and it broke my heart a little. I felt bad. I shouldn't have, but i answered her, and made her promise it wouldn't happen again. I also told her about the appointment, and she seemed reluctant but agreed to go with me. So we made up.\n\nThis was Ellen, after all. The girl i knew ever since i was six years old. The woman i loved and that had taken care of me for years. And as much as that strange behaviour creeped me out, she wasn't doing anything particularly frightening, or even dangerous. So for a brief while, i convinced myself i should give her another chance.\n\nWhen i returned home from work, we stayed together. She even prepared my favorite meal. Ellen was acting as gentle and caring as i always remembered, and i slept with her in our bedroom, even though i was still a bit reluctant.\n\n*''Knock''*\n\nI couldn't believe it. She promised me she wouldn't.\n\n*''Knock''*\n\nI gazed at the clock. *3:27 AM.* Always.\n\n*''Knock''*\n\nI was laying on my stomach and i couldn't see her face. In fact, i didn't even bother to look at her. I was feeling more sad than scared, at that point. Sad that she had broken her word.\n\n*''Knock''*\n\n''Who's there?'' - I answered, determined to just go back to sleep.\n\n*''Not me. So don't answer the door.''*\n\nI stayed quiet and closed my eyes. I just hoped i would be able to handle it until the appointment next week.\n\nTo my surprise, i was actually able to sleep. Probably because i hadn't been able to rest since last night. The following morning, i went back to not saying anything to Ellen, only very limited responses. I was expecting her to act same as yesterday, trying to apologize, but she didn't. Mostly she didn't say anything, almost as if she had accepted it. She also looked tired, or at least a bit weak.\n\nI went to work, but i couldn't stop thinking about her. Didn't receive any messages either. Once i got back, we had the most silent dinner i ever had in my life. And she barely ate anything.\n\nI decided to let her have the bedroom and sleep on the couch. I wasn't sure if it would stop her, but held on to the hope that she wouldn't go downstairs only to tell me the same Knock Knock joke again. I covered myself with a blanket, shaked off that uneasy feeling and tried to sleep.\n\nI had a deep sleep, without dreams. Felt like i was lost in darkness. Then i heard breathing.\n\nOpened my eyes to see Ellen, standing above me, looking at me with big, fixated eyes and dilated pupils that didn't seem to belong in such a completly neutral expression. Watching me sleep.\n\nI almost screamed in terror. Jumped out of the couch, and her eyes followed me as i stumbled through the dark room, creating distance between us. For a moment i was able to glance at the clock above the table: *3:27 AM.*\n\n''Ellen, what are you doing?!'' - I asked, desperate. But she didn't move.\n\nIn fact, she didn't say anything. Just stared at me, as if i was made of glass and she could see right through me.\n\nThen i heard a knock on the front door.\n\nInstinctively, i looked in that direction. It was followed by another knock. And another. Someone almost pounding at the door.\n\nI glanced back at Ellen, and she was still staring at me. Slowly, i got closer to the door and she didn't move. The pounding continued.\n\n''Who's there?!'' - I screamed.\n\nIt stopped. And then, i heard a voice.\n\n''John? John, can you hear me? Open the door, please! John, please open the door!''\n\nI froze in place. The voice kept calling me. But i couldn't believe it. It was Ellen's voice, coming from the other side of the door. But it couldn't be.\n\n''I beg you, John! Open the door, it's serious! She's not me, i swear! She's not me!''\n\nSlowly i turned my head to look at Ellen, standing in front of the couch. She was looking at me, the same fixated eyes and a terrible, wide grin across her face.\n\nThe pounding continued. ''John, open the door! Please, you have to trust me!''\n\nI stayed still, not knowing what to do. And i don't remember what happened after that.\n\nI just woke up in my bedroom. The digital clock indicates it's *4:21 AM.* Ellen isn't by my side, i'm completly alone. I'm trembling, uncontrollably and i don't know what's going on. I don't remember what happened after i saw her terrible grim. I don't know if i opened the door.\n\nI tried to look for my phone, see if i could call the police, or at least someone that i know. But i left it downstairs. All i have is Ellen's laptop, and it's where i'm writing this right now, to get advice. Because i can't go downstairs. The corridor is dark, very dark, almost as if the shadows were leaning into the room. And i can hear a faint, scratching sound coming from below.\n\nWhat should i do?"},"294":{"title":"I'm a Search and Rescue Officer for the US Forest Service, I have some stories to tell (Part 4!)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3jadum\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/","flair":"Series","author":"searchandrescuewoods","selftext":"Part 1: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3iex1h\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/\n\nPart 2: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3ijnt6\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/\n\nPart 3: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3iocju\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/\n\nHey guys! I'm back from my training op, and I have a lot of really interesting stories to share with you. I've got enough that I'm going to break them up into two parts, this being the first. I'd love to put them all in one entry, but I just haven't had a chance to write them all down yet.\nI didn't have anything too crazy happen while I was out there, but we did have one incident with a rookie that I found relevant. Since I'm sure you guys have been waiting for these, I'll just get right into the stories. I'll assign each batch of stories to the person who told them to me.\n\n**K.D:** \nK. D is a vet who's been an SAR officer for about fifteen years. She specializes in high elevation mountain rescues, and is widely considered one of the best in her field. She was one of the more enthusiastic storytellers, and since we were together a fair amount during exercises, she ended up telling me about four that really stuck with me.\n\n* The first she told me in response to my asking about her most traumatic calls. She shook her head and told me that really bad calls happen more frequently on the mountain, since the potential for nasty accidents is higher. \nAbout five years ago, one of the parks she worked at had a string of disappearances. It was a bad year, she said, one of the worst on record as far as weather went. They were getting about a foot of new snow every couple of days, and there were a few avalanches that killed some climbers. They'd warned people about staying on the mapped areas, but of course there's always those who don't listen.\nIn one particularly nasty case, an entire family got wiped out because the father decided he knew better than the officials, and he took them out into an area that wasn't safe. They were snowshoeing, and as best K.D could figure, they'd walked onto a shelf of snow that looked solid, but actually wasn't. It gave way, and this family went ass over teakettle almost three hundred feet down a slope. They landed on the rocks at the bottom, and the parents died instantly. One of the kids did as well, but the other two survived. One had a broken leg and fractured ribs, the other was almost unharmed save for some bruising and a sprained ankle. The uninjured child left his sibling behind and set out to find help. \nK.D said the kid didn't make it more than half a mile before a storm overtook him. Kid stopped to try and get warm, or maybe just to rest, and ended up freezing to death. They ended up finding the family with the help of some witnesses who saw them heading out into the wilderness, and she was the one to find the kid who'd frozen to death looking for help. She said it had started to snow, just enough to obscure long-distance vision, but not enough to make searching impossible. She saw a figure sitting in the snow up ahead, and she got to it as quickly as possible. She described, in detail, how as she got closer, she realized first that it was a child, second that they were deceased, and third that they had frozen in one of the most pitiful positions she's ever found a corpse in.\nThe kid was sitting upright, with his knees tucked up against his chest. His arms were curled around them, and his head was tucked up in his coat. When she moved the coat to look at his face, she saw that he'd died crying. His face was twisted, and the tears were frozen on his cheeks. She said it was painfully obvious that the kid was terrified when he succumbed to hypothermia, and as a mother, it broke her heart. She told me, repeatedly, that she hopes the father is burning in hell as we speak. \n\n* The other traumatic story she told me that stood out, in my mind, was one that happened when she was a rookie. Her team got a report of an experienced climber who hadn't come home the previous day. His wife was convinced that something bad had happened, because he'd never failed to come home on time. They went out looking for him, and had to climb what sounded like some very technically challenging parts of the mountain. They got to a relatively flat area, and K.D started seeing blood in the snow. She followed the trail, and as she went, she started seeing little bits of tissue. She wasn't sure exactly what body part it had come from, but the farther she followed it, the more there was. She follows this blood-and-tissue trail to a sheltered area under a cliff face, and she finds the climber. She said there was so much blood, more than she'd ever seen before. He was lying face down, one arm stretched in front of him, as if he'd died crawling. She looks closer, and sees that he's been partially disemboweled, which is where the tissue she'd seen had come from. The guy has an ice pick tucked into a hip holster, and it's covered in blood. Of course, they'll never be sure exactly what happened, but she said as best she can figure, this is what went down:\nThe guy had been attempting to climb up to the next area, and had been using his ice ax to ascend. He'd probably hit a loose patch, and had fallen. On the way down, or possibly when he landed, he'd gotten impaled by the ax, and it had disemboweled him. He'd drug himself along, tearing pieces of himself out as he went, and had died under the cliff face. She isn't terribly bothered by gore, but I guess a few of the guys who came to help her remove the body threw up when they turned him over and a good portion of his intestines spilled out.\n\n* I mentioned to her that I was interested in hearing about any experiences she had with people completely disappearing. Her eyes light up, and she leans in close to me. \n'Wanna hear a real doozy?' She asks. \nShe tells me about how, when she first started, there was a case that got a lot of attention in the media. A family had been out berry picking in an area of the forest very close to the entrance of the park. They had two little boys, both under the age of five, and at some point during the day, one of them vanishes. There's an absolutely massive search, and they find absolutely nothing. It's another of those cases where it's like the kid was never there in the first place. The dogs just sit down and don't pick up on anything, no trace of the kid is found. The search goes on for about two months, but is eventually called off.\nFast forward to six months later. The family comes back to place flowers at a memorial that's been set up there for the kid. They bring their other son. While they're placing the flowers, they lose sight of the kid for about three seconds, and in that span of time he vanishes into thin air. Now obviously, the parents are beyond devastated. It's awful enough to lose one child, but to lose two is beyond imagining. The search is huge, one of the largest in state history. There are about three hundred volunteers combing every inch of this park, looking for the kid. But again, there's no trace of him. The search goes on for about a week, with people looking miles from the part of the park he vanished from.\nAnd then, almost two weeks later, a volunteer almost fifteen miles from the designated search area radios in that he's found the kid. They assumed that the kid was dead, but the volunteer says he's not only alive, he's in good shape. K.D and her team go out to recover the kid, and when they get there, she can't believe that this is the kid that's been missing. His clothes are clean, there's no dirt on him anywhere, and he doesn't appear traumatized. The volunteer says he found the kid sitting on a log, playing with a little twig bundle that's bound together with some old rope. K.D asks him where he's been, who he was with for those two weeks, and the kid tells her that he's been with 'the fuzzy man'. Now K.D firmly believes in Bigfoot, so she gets all excited and asks what he means by fuzzy. Was he hairy? But the kid says no, he wasn't hairy. He was a 'fuzzy man', and he describes a man that's blurry, 'like when you close your eyes but not all the way closed.' He says the man came out of the trees and took the kid with him deep into the woods. The kid says he slept in a hollow tree, and the fuzzy man gave him berries to eat. K.D asks if the man was mean, if he scared the kid, and the kid says 'no, he wasn't scary. but i didn't like how he didn't have eyes.'\nK.D says they get the kid back to headquarters, and a cop takes him into town to talk to him more about what happened. She's friends with the cop that talked to him, and she said the kid described being kept in this tree by the fuzzy man, and given berries whenever he was hungry. He was allowed to wander around a very specific clearing, but when he tried to go further, the fuzzy man would 'get mad and yell real loud even though he didn't have a mouth'. When the kid got scared at night, the fuzzy man 'made it go brighter' and gave him the twig bundle. He said the fuzzy man was going to keep him, but he had to let him go because the kid wasn't 'the right kind.' He either can't or won't elaborate more on that. The cops are just sort of left scratching their heads, and the search for his brother is renewed with no results. The kid has no idea where his brother might be, and they never find him.\n\n* The last story that K.D told me was of something that happened to her when she got separated from her training group when she was a rookie. They were learning the basics of high elevation belaying on a well-mapped side of the mountain, and she had to use the bathroom. She went off about fifty yards from the group during a meal break, and did her business. I'll tell the rest exactly as she told it to me'\n'So I go to take a piss, and once I'm done, I start going back to the group. But I've only gotten about five feet when I realize that I have no idea where I am. And this wasn't a 'oh, I got turned around' lost. I mean I had literally no fucking clue where I was. If you'd asked me, I don't even think I'd have been able to tell you what state we were in. It was sort of how I imagine people with amnesia feel, you know? You're completely lost, and you have no idea what to do. So I stood there for a while, just trying to figure out where the fuck I was and what I was supposed to do. But the longer I stand there, the more confused and turned around I get, so I started walking. As I recall, I just picked a random direction and went for it. And as I'm walking, it's just getting worse and worse to the point where I have no concept of why I'm on the mountain in the first place. I'm just trudging through the snow, and then I start hearing this voice. It's kind of inside my head, almost. Like if a frog could talk, all low and croaky. And it's telling me over and over 'it's okay, it's okay, you just need to find something to eat. Find something to eat and you'll be okay, just keep walking and find something to eat. Eat. Eat.' So I start looking around for anything that I can eat, and I swear to god I've never felt that hungry in my whole life. It was bottomless, and I think I'd have eaten just about anything you put in front of me right then. I had no concept of time, so I had no idea how long I'd been out when I hear an actual voice coming toward me. I go toward it and see one of the other SARs, and he looks fucking terrified. He's running toward me, asking if I'm okay and what the hell I'm doing out here. \nAnd the scary thing was, as he's running toward me, I kind of see myself reaching into my belt for my hunting knife. I'm not even really thinking about what I'm doing, but what I am thinking is that I have to eat. If I don't eat, I'll never be okay again, so I just have to eat. He sees me doing that and he backs off right away. He yells at me to put my knife away, that he's not gonna hurt me, and that kind of snaps me back. All of a sudden, I know exactly where I am, and I put the knife away. I run to him and ask him how long I've been gone, thinking he'll tell me I've been gone for half an hour or so. But he tells me I've been gone for two fucking days. I've gone over two peaks and ended up almost on the other side of the mountain, and if I'd kept going, I would have ended up wandering into about three hundred miles of wilderness. They'd never have found me. He can't believe I'm not dead, and of course I don't know what the fuck to think. To me, no time has passed at all. I don't say anything, I just go back with him to a rendezvous point and I'm taken back to HQ  to be airlifted to the hospital. When I get there, they do all kinds of tests, and try to figure out what happened. As best they can guess, I had some kind of weird fugue state, which is kind of like amnesia, or a weird seizure that knocked my brain out of whack. But the truth is that we really don't know. It's never happened again, but I'll tell you, ever since then I never go out there alone. People rag on me for making them come with me when I have to leave the group, but I just tell 'em that listening to me piss in the snow is better than losing me for two fucking days on a freezing mountain.'\n\n**EW:**\nThe next person I talked to was E.W, a former trainer who now works as an EMT. He still comes to ops like this to help out, but doesn't work full-time for us anymore. He specialized in finding lost kids, he just seemed to have a sixth sense when it came to knowing where they'd gone. He's a legend among the more senior vets, but he gets embarrassed if you compliment him on his work. He sat down with me at dinner one evening, and we ended up swapping stories. Most of them were just casual, but when we got on the subject of our weirder calls, I mentioned that I'd had a buddy who'd gone up a set of stairs. He got kind of quiet and asked me if I'd heard of a little boy who'd disappeared from his park a few years back. I hadn't, so he told me this story.\n\n* They were out looking for this eleven-year-old boy, Joey, who'd gone missing near a river. Of course, the first thought was that he'd fallen in and drowned, but when they brought dogs out, they led SAR officers away from the river and up into a very densely forested area. When we do searches for people, we search in a grid pattern, and we search every 'box' of the grid incredibly thoroughly. What E.W's team noticed right away was that a very strange pattern was emerging. Dogs in alternating boxes were picking up Joey's scent, but losing it when they overlapped with another box. If you think of a checkerboard, Joey's scent was being picked up in random black squares, but never in red. This, of course, didn't make any sense, because how could the kid bounce from area to area without leaving a scent in each place he passed? E.W and his partner pass into a new box of the grid, and E.W notices a set of stairs about fifty yards away. He tells his partner that they need to go check near it, but his partner flat-out refuses. He tells E.W that he's made it a point never to go near any stairs he sees, and that while it may be routine, he's not to pretend that it's normal. He tells E.W that he'll wait in sight while E.W checks. E.W says he was irritated, but he felt for the guy, and didn't push him on the subject. \n'I walked over to the stairs. They were small, kind of like stairs into a basement. I don't really feel strongly one way or the other about them, the stairs I mean, so I wasn't scared or anything. I guess I'm like everyone else, and I just prefer not to think about them too much.\n'Anyway, I went over and I could see that there was something lying on the bottom step, sort of curled up. My hear sinks, because of course you always hope for the best. And we were confident that we'd find this kid alive, because he'd only been missing for a few hours. But I knew right away that it was him, and that he was dead. He was curled up in a little ball on the step, holding his stomach. It looked like he'd been in horrible pain when he died, but I didn't see any blood, except some on his lips and chin. I radioed in that I'd found him, and we got his body back to command. That poor family, they were devastated. The parents couldn't understand how he'd be dead, 'cause he'd only been gone for such a short amount of time. And on top of that we didn't have any obvious cause of death, which just made it worse. I figured he'd probably eaten something poisonous, since he was holding his stomach when I found him, but I didn't want to guess. It's hard enough to hear that your kid is dead, let alone have some stupid SAR guy guessing about what happened. They took him away, and I went home and tried not to think about it. I hate finding dead kids, man. I loved this job but it's one of the reasons I left. I've got two daughters, and the thought of losing them that way just...' \nHe choked up a little here. I'm not great with emotional stuff like that, and it's always sort of awkward to see a grown man cry, so I didn't really know what to do. He pulled himself together eventually, though, and he kept going.\n'We don't always hear back from the coroners about cause of death. It's not really our job to know, I guess, and sometimes if they think it's foul play they won't tell us because of legal bullshit. But I've got a friend who works for the sheriff's department, and he'll usually pass along any interesting info if I ask. In this case, though, I actually got a call from him about a week later. He asks if I remember the kid, and of course I do, and he says some seriously weird shit is going on. He tells me, 'E.W, man, you're gonna think I'm crazy, but the coroner has no idea what happened to this kid. He's never seen anything like it.' My friend goes on to tell me that when the coroner opened the kid up, he couldn't even believe what he was seeing. The kid's organs were like swiss cheese. Quarter-sized holes were punched clean through just about every single organ this kid had, aside from his heart and lungs. But his colon, his stomach, his kidneys and even one of his testicles, were full of these clean holes. My friend said the coroner described it as if someone had taken a hole-punch and punched holes out of everything, they were so neat. But the kid didn't have a scratch on him, no entry or exit wounds. The closest anyone there had ever seen like it was a guy who'd filled himself full of buckshot a year or so back while cleaning his rifle. No one had a clue what could possibly have caused it. My friend asked me if I'd ever heard of anything like it, or if we'd had similar cases in the past. But I'd never even heard of something like that, and I told him I wasn't going to be of any help to him. As far as I know, the coroner determined the cause of death as something like 'massive internal bleeding', but no one knows what really happened.\nI've never been able to forget that kid. I have nightmares about it sometimes. I don't let my kids go into the woods alone, and when we go together I never let them out of my sight. I used to love it out here. But that case, and a couple others, just sort of ruined it for me.'\nDinner was over, so we started to clean up and go back to our cabins. Before we went our separate ways, he put his hand on my shoulder and looked at me really close. He tells me that there's bad things out here. Things that don't care if we have families or lives, or that we can think and feel. He tells me to be careful, and he walks away. I didn't a chance to talk with him again, but that story stuck with me.\n\n**PB:**\nBy pure coincidence, I got to talk to another vet, P.B who's been in the SAR field for years. We were partnered on a grid sweep during a training exercise, and we were chatting casually about how we liked the job, what kinds of things we'd seen, and the like. At one point, we passed an old set of stairs, though these were probably from an old fire lookout, given the area that we were in. I sort of casually mentioned that I was curious about the stairs, and that I wished I knew more about them. He got kind of quiet and looked like he wanted to tell me something, but wasn't sure if he should. Finally, he told me to turn my radio off. Obviously this is something we are never, ever supposed to do, but I did it, and he did the same. \n\n* About seven years ago, he tells me, he was out on a call with a rookie. They were in an area of the park that's had a lot of strange reports and events. Disappearances, stories about lights in the forest, odd noises, things like that. The rookie was totally spooked, kept going on and on about 'things out in the woods'. According to P.B:\n'The guy wouldn't stop talking about 'the Goatman'. Just on and on, 'Goatman' this and 'Goatman' that. Finally, I told him that there was plenty else to be afraid of out here that was very real, and that he'd better get over this thing with the Goatman. The rookie wanted to know what kinds of things I was talking about, and I just told him to shut up and walk. We crested a little ridge and there was a staircase about ten yards ahead. The rookie stops dead in his tracks and just stands there looking at them. I tell him, 'See? That's something you should be afraid of.' The rookie asks me what the hell these are doing out here, and for some reason, I just open up and tell him the truth. Or what I've been told is the truth. I could have gotten in a lot of trouble for doing what I did, and I could get in a lot of trouble for repeating it to you. But you're a nice kid, and I want you to stop looking into this. Quit while you're ahead. So I'll tell you what I know, under the condition that you never breathe a word of this to the supes.'\nI told him I wouldn't say a word, and he double-checks that our radios are off.\n'When I first started out, we were a little less tight-lipped about them, and other things that happen out here. We warned people before they were even hired that there was weird shit going on. I guess the Forest Service was tired of having such a massive turnover rate, and they wanted people to know what they were getting into. So they started having people sign these agreements that they wouldn't go to the media about what they were going to see. The FS didn't want to scare people away, so the last thing they needed were spooked rookies running off to the media with stories of ghosts and haunted stairs. But eventually, they found that the agreements weren't necessary. People not only didn't want to talk about what they saw, they wouldn't. A few times, media tried to talk to people when kids or hikers would disappear, and no one would say a word. I can't really explain it. I guess we just... don't really want to admit anything is wrong. This is our job, to be out in the woods every single day. We don't need to be spooked, and the best way to avoid that is to pretend like everything's okay. So I'll tell you everything I can think of, and after that, I'm done talking about it for good. And I expect you not to bring it up around me, ever.\n'The stairs have been out here as long as the parks have existed. We have records going back decades describing them. Sometimes people go up them, and nothing happens. Other times... Look, I really don't like talking about this, but sometimes, really bad shit happens. I saw one guy get his hand sliced clean off when he got to the top step. He reached out to touch a tree branch, and it happened so fast. One second his hand was there, and the next it was gone. Completely clean wound. We didn't find his hand, and the guy almost died. Another time, a woman touched one of the stairs, and a blood vessel in her brain exploded. Literally exploded, like a water balloon. She sort of stumbled down and came over to me, and all she got out was 'I think something is wrong with me.' She dropped like a sack of flour, dead before she hit the ground. I'll never forget the way the blood leaked into the inside of her eye. Before she died, I watched it turn red. I watched it happen and there wasn't a single thing I could do to help.\n'We warn people not to go anywhere near them but there's always at least one idiot who does. And even if nothing happens to them, something bad always happens. Kids go missing as we're on their trail. Someone dies the next day, cut in half in a completely safe part of the park. I don't know why, but something bad always happens. I don't know exactly why they're out here, but it doesn't matter. They're here, and if we were smart, we'd tell our new officers exactly what they're capable of.'\nWe were both quiet for a little while. I was afraid to talk because I wasn't sure if he was done. He looked like he wanted to say something else. Finally he spoke up again.\n'Have you ever noticed how you can't find the same ones twice?'\nI nodded, expecting him to continue. But he just stayed quiet, walking alongside me, and eventually he started a story about the biggest deer he'd ever seen in the park. I didn't bring up the subject again, and I didn't press him for any more stories. He dropped out of the op the next day. Apparently he left before the sun came up; he said he was sick. None of us have heard from him since he left.\n\nI'm going to stop here for the time being. I'll try and post the next part in the coming days, but what with it being the end of summer, things are pretty busy here. Thanks for the continued interest, guys, you've really awakened this curiosity in me that I didn't know I had!\n\n**EDIT**: Part Five is up: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3kd90k\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/"},"295":{"title":"I can see people's auras... and it's a curse.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/6xer5n\/i_can_see_peoples_auras_and_its_a_curse\/","flair":null,"author":"A10A10A10","selftext":"Yes, I can see people’s auras. \n\nAnd I hate saying it so bluntly.  It makes me sound like some hack psychic who fakes the ability as a means of exploitation and a paycheck.  I’ve never made money from my ability. I’ve never taken advantage of it.  And, until now, I’ve never spoken of it to anybody.\n\nBut I really do see them, and I’m starting to view it as more of a curse.  I have a reason for typing this out and I assure you, there isn’t a happy ending.   \n\nFor me, it’s quite simple.  I see a faint light surrounding people.  Everyone.  And in that light, I can see their *morality*.  The brighter and more translucent the light is, the better the person.  The darker and opaquer, the worse.  Dim and partly translucent are morally ambiguous.   To simplify things, those are the three ways I describe them.  Dark equals evil.   Bright equals good.  Dim equals somewhere in between.  It’s strange, I’ve always viewed the people with grey\/dim auras as… arbiters.  Mediators.  The people in between, who aren’t one or the other, and will always have difficult decisions to make.\n\nI was a child when I first became aware of my gift.  It didn’t take long to figure out that the brighter auras were kinder to me and selfless.  While both of my parents are good people, my father’s aura was quite a bit brighter than my mothers.  As a result, he was always far more patient and understanding with me.   It was clear to see that my teachers and fellow students with brighter auras were usually friendlier and more compassionate.  The dark auras were the stereotypical fighters, lunch money stealers, and bullies.  I would say I was around 8 years old when I fully figured out that I have a gift that most people don’t have.  That possibly *nobody* else has.\n\nI’ve read some of the ‘new age’ websites and alternative medicine articles that give their take on aura reading.  While I believe that the vast majority of it is bullshit, I expect there must be at least SOME other people out there with my ability.  So I don’t want to completely dismiss those people as an outright hoax.  It’s just that, for me, it doesn’t work anything like the way those websites describe.  I’ve visited numerous aura readers and psychics.  Most of them have dim or dark auras themselves, and I’m certain they don’t really hold this power.  I’m not saying all “psychics” are terrible people.  I’ve visited a few who had very bright auras.  They were unable to convince me that they really have psychic powers, but they at the very least used their deception to try and help people.  \n\nYou need to understand… I’m going to end this entry by sharing a terrifying event that is happening to me.  But before I get to that, I think there are a few more things I need to explain.  I imagine many of you are curious as to what type of aura is the most common.  I’m happy to tell you that the majority of people are somewhere between dim and bright.  I see very few dark auras.  This isn’t scientific, and I haven’t traveled the world plotting out charts and graphs, but I’d estimate around 60% of people are bright-ish.  Around 25% dim-ish.  Leaving just around 15% dark-ish.  Again, these are just estimates.  What’s the precise difference between, say, bright and dim?  I have no idea.  But rest assured, there is far more “bright” in the world than “dark”.\n\nThe next thing I’d like to discuss is children.  I can see a person’s aura right from birth, and I’ve never encountered an aura changing as someone ages.  I’m not sure what this means for the whole nature vs nurture debate.  And I’m not saying that everyone with a dark aura always behaves terribly, or vice versa.  A person with a bright aura might be born in horrible conditions, acquire a drug problem, and then resort to thievery to feed their addiction.  I think the difference is this… a bright aura thief with a horrible upbringing may rob someone, but they would never intentionally hurt someone in the process.  A dark aura thief would kill someone if they could get away with it without even a second thought.  \n\nAnother interesting note…  I find the ratio between bright\/dim\/dark to be similar across pretty much all human activities.  Whether I’m at a church or a death metal concert, it always seems to be around that same 60%-25%-15% ratio.  I once visited a federal prison and was shocked to see that at least half of the prisoners had bright auras.  I had to be at the prison in person to see this because I can’t see auras on photographs, television shows, movies, or even in mirrors.  I can only see auras in the real world.  Another strange thing… I can’t even see my own aura.   I assume and hope I would be on the brighter spectrum… but I can’t see it.\n\nThe brightest person I ever saw worked as a social worker.  She shone so bright that it was difficult for me to even look at her.  Based on the way people acted in her presence, I think that almost everyone around her could sense her brightness in a subconscious way.  Everyone loved her. She had donated a kidney to someone she barely even knew.  She had a special needs adopted child.  Most of the money she earned was donated to various charities.  And that’s only the little that I knew of her.  This woman shined so brightly that she scared me.  It was scary that someone could be so good.\n\nBut it wasn’t nearly as scary as the darkest person I ever saw.  I was 20 years old at the time, leaving a club downtown at 2 am.  A man quietly walked down the street.  I didn’t see him at first, but I noticed the light dimming around me.  This man was so dark that he partly absorbed the light around him.  I looked at him long and hard.  He looked desperate, cruel, and callous.  When he looked up and locked eyes with me, it made me fall back.  He smirked, as though he knew what I could see.  I saw his face up close.  I would never forget it.  And I recognized it when I saw his mugshot a few weeks later in the newspaper.  He had murdered his ex-wife and two children in cold blood.  \n\nI think I need to get to it now.  The reason why I’m writing this out.  \n\nI fell in love a year ago.  She didn’t shine anywhere near as bright as what I’ve seen before, but she most assuredly wasn’t dark or even dim.  She was beautiful.  Her sense of humor, her wit, her.. everything.  She was my dream woman.  And I’ve never told her anything at all about the auras I see.  I could go into far more about her but this isn’t a love story.  What’s important is this:  We fell in love.  She got pregnant.  We got married.  We were happy.  We were *so* happy.\n\nI remember hearing the buzz of my phone two mornings ago.  I remember my excitement when I saw “It’s happening.  Come to the hospital.”  I remember my frustration when I got stuck in traffic.  I remember how long it took to find a parking spot.  I remember shouting at a nurse “WHAT ROOM IS MY WIFE IN.”  I remember bursting through a door and seeing the smile on my wife’s face.  I remember seeing the doctor, his light shining so bright, as he told me “Congratulations, it’s a boy.”\n\nThe doctor held him up to me.  \n\nAnd all the light in the room dissipated.  \n\n“No, this can’t be.”  I remember saying.    The doctor put him in my arms.  \n\nThe darkness around my son was so absolute that I could barely even see him.  He was a void.  He was so dark that the world barely even existed around him.  It was like nothing I’d ever experienced.  I started weeping.  I think my wife and the doctor thought they were tears of joy.  But they weren’t.  Lord knows they weren’t.\n\nI think back to the dark outline around that man that murdered his family.  It was up to that point the darkest I’d ever seen.  But the darkness around my son was 100 times worse.  A *thousand* times worse.  And what could possibly be a thousand times worse than murdering your entire family?\n\nIt’s been two days.  We’re home now.  My son’s darkness is so extreme that it dims the hallway leading to his room.  My wife knows something is wrong.  I think she suspects I’m having regrets about having children at all.  If only she knew…\n\nWhat do I do?  He’s my son.  Just 20 minutes ago I stood above him, holding a pillow over his face.  But I couldn’t do it.  Not yet anyway.  A man who could murder his two-day old baby boy: what color would his aura be? \n\nAnd here’s the thought that keeps going through my mind as I sit here alone.  The fathers of our worst.  The Adolf Hitler’s.  Joseph Stalin’s.  Timothy McVeigh’s. If their fathers knew what they would become, would they murder them in the cradle?  Would they have the strength to hold down the pillow as long as it takes?\n\nI can see the door of my son’s room from my office.  The hallway seems to be growing darker.  I look down at my hands as I type this.  Maybe I’m going crazy, but there seems to be an aura around my hands and arms now.  It’s gray.  It’s dim.  Maybe it’s always been dim.  \n\nI’m looking down at the pillow beside me.    The grayish dim outline around my hands more apparent than ever. Maybe it’s time.  Maybe this is why I have this gift.  It all comes down to right now.  \n\nMaybe it’s time.\n\nI think it’s time.\n"},"296":{"title":"The James Webb Telescope discovered something terrifying in deep space","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/vuhfl9\/the_james_webb_telescope_discovered_something\/","flair":null,"author":"Phonecloth","selftext":"I work for NASA as an astronomer, and there are certain things we keep hidden from the public. No, the Earth isn't flat, and aliens don't control the government. Fuck, I wish those were the case, as the truth is much, much worse.\n\nIn 1993, the Hubble Space Telescope saw a star disappear. It didn't go supernova, or die naturally, it simply went dark, over the span of a few minutes. This star was already too faint to see with the naked eye, and ground-based telescopes had trouble picking it out from among the surrounding stars, so the event wasn't widely known to the public. At the time, we thought the most likely explanation was that a cloud of interstellar dust had drifted between Earth and the star, occluding it from view. It was noted and mostly forgotten about.\n\nIn 2007, two more stars vanished. Due to the circumstances of this event, this was much more concerning. The two stars in question were part of a binary system, orbiting each other at a fairly close distance. If a cloud of interstellar dust was the culprit again, they would have both seemed to disappear simultaneously, or very close to it. Instead, both stars faded individually over a period of minutes, separated by a span of about 8 hours. This binary system was also about 15 light-years closer to Earth than the star that had previously disappeared in 1993.\n\nAfter carefully reviewing millions of Hubble images, two more stars were identified which had 'gone out', in the years 1995 and 2002. These were all in the same stellar neighborhood, only a handful of light-years from each other. The only conclusion we could draw was that some unknown influence, traveling close to the speed of light, was shrouding (or destroying) these stars. Unfortunately, the Hubble wasn't sensitive enough to tell us any more than that.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope first came online a few months ago. Although official channels will tell you that it's still undergoing testing, we have been actively collecting data since early February. One of the first things we did was to aim the telescope at the regions of space occupied by the vanished stars. If they were being blocked by dust clouds (a hope some of us still held onto), the increased sensitivity of the JWST may have been able to see through them and confirm that the stars were still there. Unfortunately, we had no such luck. The first 3 stars that had disappeared were still completely dark. Gravitational wave detectors, though, soon found something odd. In all cases, not only were the stellar masses still present, but the amount of mass had actually increased. More sensitive observations had also detected a type of 'string', or 'web' stretching through space connecting these now-invisible stars.\n\nWhen we trained the telescope on the binary system that had vanished in 2007, which was the nearest point at which this phenomenon had so far been observed, there was finally enough ambient EM spectrum radiation left to try a mass spectrometer reading. If you're not aware, mass spectrometry is an incredibly useful process, where by measuring the patterns of light wavelengths emitted or reflected by an object, we can learn tons of useful information, such as its temperature, speed and direction of movement, and chemical composition. The readings we got from the binary stars didn't make any sense, though. First of all, they were cold - almost as cold as the surrounding interstellar medium. Whatever had happened to these stars had snuffed them out completely, or somehow prevented their light from escaping. What was truly puzzling, however, were the emission lines returned by the mass spectrometer. Several familiar elements, such as Hydrogen, Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Magnesium were identified, but these were few and far between. Most of the readings didn't correspond to any known chemical elements, and even seemed to defy what we knew about the physics of light, matter, and chemistry. This massive, star-spanning structure was primarily composed of materials that we didn't even have names for, and may not even have been matter as we understand it.\n\nSpeculation ran rampant. Obviously, such a thing couldn't be a natural phenomenon. Finally, we had proof of extraterrestrial life! But what was this thing we had discovered, and for what purpose was it being built? The leading hypothesis was that we were looking at a series of Dyson Shells - massive solar collectors built to completely envelop stars, in order to capture 100% of their energy output. Such a concept had been envisioned in the early 20th century, as a potential source of energy for an interstellar civilization. Ever since then, the idea had found its way into popular science fiction. The construction of these massive structures had actually been theorized to be one of the first signs of intelligent extraterrestrial life that we may someday detect. It seemed that day was today.\n\nThe theory still didn't explain everything, though. First of all, there was the impossible speed with which the stars were covered. Constructing a Dyson shell from scratch in a matter of minutes was beyond even the wildest speculations of scientists and sci-fi writers. Then there were the mysterious 'filaments' that connected the shells over distances of light-years. No one had any idea what purpose these could serve, or how they could even be built.\n\nEveryone at NASA was fascinated by this mystery. In hindsight, we may have been better off if we had never discovered the truth.\n\nLess than a month ago, the JWST detected a series of unusual energy bursts emanating from interstellar space. These were occurring at the very edge of a star system approximately 12 light-years from the binary system that vanished in 2007. As we focused the telescope on this system, we soon determined that these were not natural phenomena either. The energy signatures, which were still flashing intermittently, matched what would be expected from thermonuclear and antimatter - based explosions, along with several other types of energies that we couldn't identify. These explosions, although still not visible to the naked eye on Earth from that distance, were absolutely tremendous in magnitude - easily billions of times more powerful than any nuke that humanity could conceivably build.  \n\n\nAfter experimenting with the telescope's settings, we were able to get a clearer picture of what was going on: The tip of one of the interstellar 'filaments' that linked the Dyson system was passing through the Oort Cloud of the distant star system, approaching its sun. And whoever lived there was fighting back. Their weapons were able to slow the thing's advance, shattering, breaking off, and vaporizing planet-sized chunks of the object, but it seemed to be rebuilding itself almost as fast as it was being destroyed. After less than a week, the explosions stopped. It seems that they had run out of ammunition. In the void between stars, we knew that these things traveled at nearly the speed of light, but as we watched it approach the inner star system, its pace slowed as it swelled in size, preparing to devour the system's star.\n\nWe quickly trained the telescope's mirrors on the doomed sun. We were about to watch whatever this thing was blot out another star, but in real time. We all held our breath as we watched the projected image of the main sequence star, slightly larger than our own sun. At first, nothing seemed to be happening, but soon a small shadow appeared on the edge of the luminous orb, soon followed by another shadow, and then a third. The shadows began to converge, forming a strange yet somehow familiar pattern as they blocked out the star's light.\n\n\"What... are those?\" One of my colleagues gasped. \"They almost look like...\" she paused, as if afraid to say the next word for fear of ridicule. I, however, had no such hesitancy.\n\n\"Leaves,\" I said, my voice monotone. The situation was far too incredible to express any emotional reaction, even that of pure shock. \"They look like leaves.\"\n\nWe watched as, over a period of minutes, a web of shadowy outlines, matching the familiar shapes of oblong leaves and thin vines, proceeded to blot out the remaining light from the distant star.\n\nBy that point, everyone in the room had realized the truth. The phenomenon we had been tracking for so many years wasn't some hyper-advanced alien megastructure. Hydrogen, Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Magnesium, some of the few familiar elements we had detected? They were all components of chlorophyll.\n\nIt was a plant. An enormous plant that spanned across light-years. And, much like terrestrial plants, it sought out light to fuel itself. The filaments connecting the stars across interstellar space were stems - branches. It would grow in the direction of the nearest stars it sensed, completely enveloping them and then moving on. Any life inhabiting planets orbiting those stars would be left to freeze to death, or perhaps even worse, it was possible that the plant would devour those planets to add to its mass as well. \n\nEveryone was silent as the telescope continued to gather data. Eventually, after what seemed like an eternity, a young astronomer spoke up from the far end of the room, addressing our supervisor.\n\n\"Sir, we've begun to detect the formation of another tendril, leaving the system. Its vector is...\" he gulped. He didn't need to say any more, but he did anyway. \"It's heading directly for our sun.\"\n\n\"How much time do we have?\" the supervisor replied grimly.\n\n\"Judging by the time lag, distance, relativistic properties, and previously observed speeds of this... thing, I'd estimate no more than twenty-seven years, sir.\"\n\nTwenty-seven years. We had just watched this galactic weed overwhelm a civilization that was, at the very least, thousands of years ahead of us technologically, and we had less than three decades.\n\nI'll probably be found and silenced for posting this. But I don't care. I have to tell someone. I can't keep this a secret any longer. When the sun turns black and the world begins to freeze, at least you'll have some idea of what's going on, small comfort it may be."},"297":{"title":"Has anyone heard of the Left\/Right Game?

Maybe things are different on the road, maybe I’d just never encountered it before, but it’s clear to me now there are degrees beyond silence. A pervasive realm of deafening quiet which, following the loss of Eve and Apollo, our group has unreservedly embraced. Constructed out of our collective trauma, cemented with a cruel mixture of grief, guilt, and harrowing self-doubt, it quickly becomes apparent that this silence is stronger than all of us. The challenge of breaking it remains unmet for the rest of the journey.\n\nWe spend the next few hours burrowing through a featureless corridor of maize. The stalks rise far above the Wrangler, leaving only a thin strip of clear sky visible like the painted ceiling of a renaissance church. I find myself glancing intermittently at the CB radio, half expecting, half hoping, for Apollo’s voice to crackle through the speaker, bringing words of comfort, or a much needed attempt at levity.\n\nAfter I catch myself staring at the radio for the fifth time, I decide it might be best to get on with my work. I plug my headphones into my notebook, bring up the audio files I’ve recorded thus far, and set about creating a very rough cut of our first day on the road.\n\n**APOLLO (VO)** Everybody knows Rob, Rob's the god! Ahaha\n\nI listen through Apollo’s first interview, making notes for the closing paragraph I’ll now be forced to write about him. When I have everything I need, I listen to the interview again, and then once more. It’s not lost on me that I just want to hear his voice, to lose myself in a pleasant digital echo, far removed from the frantic screams that followed him into the asphalt.\n\nI listen to Eve’s interview next. She bristles with excitement as she talks about her upcoming visit to Roswell, steadfastly attempting to recruit me to the effort. She had no idea what she was heading into when she stepped out onto Rob’s front lawn. Then again none of us did.\n\nThe thin strip of sky is turning deep orange as I reach our encounter with the hitchhiker. It’s chilling to hear his voice after the fact, to revisit the conniving, veiled pleasantries he employed against us. I cringe as I hear Rob’s hand grasp my arm, ashamed that I let myself fall for the hitcher’s trickery.\n\n**ROB (VO):** You did good, I’m sorry for grabbin’ you. I just didn’t want you to do something you’d regret.\n\n**AS (VO):** No it’s fine. I was going to. Do you know what happens if you talk to him?\n\n**ROB (VO):** Not sure. Came close myself once, a few years back. The way he looks at you when he thinks he’s got you? I don’t think I wanna know.\n\n**AS (VO):** Rob, I-\n\nI pause the audio file, clicking back ten seconds before pressing play again.\n\n**AS (VO):** No it’s fine. I was going to. Do you know what happens if you talk to him?\n\n**ROB (VO):** Not sure. Came close myself once, a few years back. The way he looks at you when he thinks he’s-\n\nI certainly didn’t notice that at the time. I’d been so shaken by my run in with the hitcher, and so curious about the abandoned car that I’d been completely blind to anything else that had come my way. Maybe Rob misspoke, maybe he meant to say weeks or months. But if it wasn’t a mistake, if it was a truth carelessly uttered, then Rob has some explaining to do.\n\nThe Left\/Right Game was posted online in June 2016, less than a year ago.\n\nI glance sideways at him, a wall of corn rushing past us as we approach the rest stop. Throughout this trip, every emotion Rob’s displayed has seemed genuine. The sadness, the anger, the concern. They tell a story of a man who cares deeply about the welfare of those around him. Yet at the same time, it’s strikingly clear that there’s something he isn’t telling me.\n\nWith every new piece of the puzzle, the car, the text message, the faceless creature with the ringing phone, I’m left with the dilemma of when to confront Rob Guthard with what I know. I feel I’ve gathered enough to bring before him, enough to demand an explanation, but there’s no way I’d be able to truly verify his answer. I have a collection of strange and perplexing notions, lacking in the common thread that could bring me to any workable conclusion. If I am going to confront Rob, I need to uncover that thread. Much like the greatest journalists of our time, I should know the answer before I ask the question.\n\nThe jeep pulls up onto a large green space. Staring straight ahead, I find myself puzzled by the way the ground seems to stop, as if the horizon lies only twenty metres away from the car. As soon as the engine cuts out, I unbuckle my seatbelt, climb out and walk towards the grassy verge. The rest of the convoy pulls up behind me as I go.\n\nI stop a few steps short of the edge, realising we’ve found our way to the top of a sheer cliff. A sudden swaying vertigo takes over, forcing me to take a few steps back. It doesn’t feel like we’ve been heading uphill, the road has been level since Jubilation, yet somehow I’m standing at the edge of a 400 ft. rock face, descending straight downwards, the distant earth shrouded by stalks of corn.\n\nThat’s the truly strange thing about this monolithic precipice. On either side of me, the maize runs to the very edge of the cliff and, at its base, the endless harvest continues until it stretches beyond the darkening horizon in every direction. It feels like I’m standing on the cliffs of Dover, staring over a golden ocean, its waves governed by the evening breeze. I wonder for a moment where it ends, then, taking consideration of the world I now occupy, I start to wonder if it ever does.\n\nA belligerent scream rips me from the view. The source of the noise is blocked by the Wrangler and the first thing I see as I circle around are the shocked, wide eyed faces of Bonnie & Clyde. Once I make my way past the Wrangler’s hood, my expression mimics theirs.\n\nLilith has pinned Bluejay up to the side of the Jeep, a locked forearm pressing her chest against the door. Her other arm has been grasped in Bluejay’s hands, desperately stopped before it can strike her across the face. The two of them yell through gritted teeth as Lilith struggles furiously against her, vying to cause her any conceivable harm.\n\n**BLUEJAY** Get the fuck off me you bitch! Get off!\n\nI take a few quick steps over to Lilith as Bluejay attempts to kick her away.\n\n**AS:** Lilith, we can’t do this… Jen…\n\nLilith doesn’t even register my presence as she continues her assault, deafened by the bubbling vitriol in every growling breath.\n\n**AS:** Jen! We are not doing this now. Not after-\n\nBefore I can comprehend what’s happening, I’m staring at the sky, my head knocked back by the force of Lilith’s flailing elbow. A hot, raw ache radiates across my lower lip as I stagger back, raising my hand over my mouth.\n\nBefore Lilith can continue her assault, Rob swings open his door and takes two short strides over to her. He puts one arm around the girl’s waist and picks her up, carrying her safely, but firmly, over to Bonnie & Clyde’s Ford, and planting her back on the ground.\n\nI seem to always forget how strong he is.\n\n**ROB:** Damnit this is not the time.\n\n**LILITH:** Take it back!\n\nBluejay has lost her usual snide demeanour, yet her aura still radiates an unbridled scorn. In response to Lilith’s demand, Bluejay walks back to her car and sits on the hood. She takes the Marlboros out of her pocket along with her lighter, and ignites a cigarette. I imagine the burning embers are the only company she’s comfortable to accept right now.\n\nBy the time I look back to the rest of the group, Lilith has stormed away.\n\n**AS:** What did she say?\n\n**BONNIE:** I didn’t hear it all.\n\n**AS:** What did she say Bonnie?\n\n**BONNIE:** I heard something about… she said Lilith was… that we were complicit.\n\n**ROB:** Ah goddamnit… Bristol can you…\n\nI watch Lilith, as she sits on the grass and looks over the cliffside. She begins to cry, yet I get a strong notion that it’s not something I should interrupt. It feels like something between her and Eve, a final act of reactionary mourning reserved for them, and them alone. \n\n**AS:** Yeah… don’t worry. I’ll handle it.\n\n**ROB:** Ok. I’ll cook us somethin’ up.\n\nAn hour passes. Lilith grows slowly calmer, drifting from cathartic release into a cold, wordless melancholy. Finishing up my dinner, I make my way over to her.\n\n**AS:** It’s a strange view.\n\nLilith looks up at me. Her face falls.\n\n**LILITH:** I cut you… I’m so sorry.\n\n**AS:** It’s fine. You should see the other girl.\n\n**LILITH:** Hah, yeah, I bet she looks like shit right about now.\n\nI help myself down onto the cool ground, staring alongside Lilith into the ocean below.\n\n**LILITH:** Bluejay thinks I’m complicit… in what happened to Eve.\n\n**AS:** I heard.\n\n**LILITH:** She used to think we were morons, now she thinks we’re all in on it… doesn’t make sense.\n\n**AS:** I think she he has to believe this place is a lie. She needs it to make sense, and the harder it gets for her to rationalise the more she... Anyway, she shouldn’t have said what she said. She’s just... I guess the word is \"troubled\".\n\n**LILITH:** She’s a fucking thundercunt.\n\n**AS:** Umm… uh… ok.\n\n**LILITH:** She’s right though... I killed her... and I killed Apollo too.\n\nI look to Lilith, concerned, not quite sure what she means. Her eyes remain locked on the impossible horizon.\n\n**LILITH:** Sarah… she wasn’t cut out for this, and she knew it. She wanted us to turn back this morning… but I didn’t want to.\n\n**AS:** That wasn’t just your decision Lilith.\n\n**LILITH:** Yes it was. She uh… she followed my lead. Always. Through everything. And I knew why she was doing it. I knew. But I let it continue, because it was convenient, because it was easy…. because deep down I liked having someone around who… who’d jump through fucking hoops for me… god it’s so fucked.\n\nLilith rests her head in her hands.\n\n**LILITH:** She was weak. She was anxious and shy and… but that should be ok, right? You’re allowed to be weak that’s… but I made her come here. I dragged someone who couldn’t swim into the fucking deep end. And the last thing I did was lie to her and she fucking knew it.\n\nLilith takes a few deep, frayed breaths.\n\n**AS:** What do you mean?\n\n**LILITH:** I’m not uh… I didn’t, I… I loved her, you know as a… as a friend. It was always this fucking one-way street and… I don’t think she minded but. Then suddenly she’s vanishing right in-fucking-front of me and she said what she said… I mean how else was I supposed to respond to that? I had to say it back right?\n\nLilith maintains her composure as a steady stream of tears roll down her cheek.\n\n**AS:** I don’t know what I’d do in that situation.\n\n**LILITH:** I could see it in her eyes that she didn’t believe me. Fuck… I wonder how many people have died while being told like… comforting lies. How many of them fucking knew?\n\n**AS:** I think you did the best you could Jen. I think you did better than most.\n\n**LILITH:** You don’t need to tell me that just… are you tired? Do you need to go to bed soon?\n\n**AS:** No, I don’t need to.\n\n**LILITH:** There are some beers in uh… in Apollo’s bag. Is that like… looting? Or is that ok?\n\n**AS:** I think he’d want us to have them, as long as he got a toast.\n\nLilith laughs briefly and finally smiles. She walks over to Bonnie and Clyde’s car, returning a moment later with a four pack.\n\nWe spend the next hour and a half slowly drinking them. Lilith can’t muster the right words for a toast so we just say thank you to Apollo, raising out cans to the open air. We talk about his tireless humour, his attempts to keep us all up during our first night on the road, how caringly he spoke to everyone, even at the edge of death. \n\nWe talk about Eve as well, about the pair’s misadventures, awkward college parties and the future of Paranormicon. Lilith smiles, and tells me there’s always a place for me once radio dies out.\n\nAfter everything that’s happened on the road, the night can’t help but feel bittersweet. But for once, on a solitary cliff side in the middle of nowhere, it’s more sweet than it is bitter. That may not be much, but at the end of an awful day it’s more than either of us could have hoped for.\n\n*****\n\nThe next morning goes quickly. It’s amazing how efficient a group of people can be when none of them feel like talking. Not only that, but breakfast has become a noticeably brief affair. I manage to get through half a bag of trail mix before I find myself uncomfortably full. Rob’s words about the road’s sustaining properties ring in my ears as I look around the group. Everyone leaves their bowls half empty. Lilith hasn’t eaten a bite.\n\nBy this point, the launch protocol has been drilled into us. Despite our preoccupations, and the fractious rifts developing between us, the cars line up like clockwork as they merge onto the road. In fact, the mood of the group seems strangely procedural. All radio contact starts with the stating of a call sign, followed by that of the recipient. The cars maintain an even, careful distance between one another. We’ve seen all too clearly what happens when the rules are neglected, and no one wants to take chances any more.\n\n**AS:** How far away are we?\n\n**ROB:** From where?\n\n**AS:** You haven’t got to the end of this road right? I mean… you’re still charting it?\n\n**ROB:** That’s right.\n\n**AS:** Well, how long until we get to… you know to… uncharted territory?\n\n**ROB:** To be honest, not too long.\n\n**AS:** What’s going to happen once we reach that point?\n\n**ROB:** We’re gonna keep drivin’.\n\n**AS:** Until we get to the end?\n\n**ROB:** That’s the plan. You know I won’t judge you if you wanna turn around. I’m sure you can talk someone into it.\n\n**AS:** Could I talk you into it?\n\nRob smiles.\n\n**ROB:** ‘Fraid not. This trip ain’t like the others. Road’s kickin’ back like never before. I think it knows I’m comin’ all the way this time.\n\n**AS:** … What is this place Rob?\n\nRob sighs as he slowly takes the next left on a quiet, rural T-junction.\n\n**ROB:** I think it’s a stray thread… runnin’ off the spool.\n\nThe radio crackles.\n\n**BONNIE:** Rob you just took the wrong turn.\n\nAn instant drum of fresh panic hammers in my chest. I stare at Rob, and he stares right back. I know he’s feeling the same thing I am, though he’s doing a much better job of keeping it off his face.\n\nHe thinks carefully for a moment.\n\n**ROB:** No… no. I been down this road before. We took a right last time.\n\n**AS:** Uhhh… yeah. Yes. The turn before this one was a right, I remember.\n\n**ROB:** Ferryman to all cars. Thanks Bonnie for giving us the fright of our lives. We’re on the righ… we’re on the correct road.\n\n**BONNIE:** No no that can’t be its… that’s wrong… Martin tell them…\n\n**CLYDE:** Our mistake Rob, let’s keep going.\n\n**LILITH:** Bristol…\n\nThere’s concern in Lilith’s voice. I lean over to my wing mirror, attempting to gauge the atmosphere in the car behind me. There’s clearly some commotion between Bonnie and Clyde, with the latter attempting to gently remove the walkie talkie from his sister’s hands.\n\nThere’s something else however. Past Bonnie & Clyde. Past Bluejay. An old, dilapidated road sign made of weathered timber stands by the side of the road behind us. I can’t read all of it as the peeling letters grow ever smaller, but I can piece together what it probably once said.\n\n“Wintery Bay – 5 Miles”\n\n**BONNIE:** We’re going to turn around right?\n\n**AS:** Uhh one second Bonnie, I’ll… check the map.\n\nI promptly switch off the radio.\n\n**AS:** Are we not passing through Wintery Bay?\n\nRob turns to me, a puzzled look in his eyes.\n\n**ROB:** Through where?\n\nIn the wake of those two, innocently inquiring words, my mind reels back to the morning of our third day on the road. Watching Bonnie and Clyde wander over to Rob to confess their transgressions with the hitchhiker, the quiet conversation that passed between them, Rob’s seemingly comforting response. I’d felt wretched in those moments. A few minutes prior I had tricked and deceived Clyde… yet I’d never once considered he might have done the same to me.\n\n**AS:** Is it safe to pull over?\n\n**ROB:** What? Why?\n\n**AS:** Is it safe Rob?\n\n**ROB:** Uh, yeah should be.\n\n**AS:** Then pull over.\n\nI switch the radio back on and grab the receiver. As I make a connection to Bonnie and Clyde’s car, it’s clear that an argument is brewing. Lilith is asking for me, a helpless passenger, caught in the middle of something she doesn’t understand.\n\n**AS:** Bristol to all cars. We’re stopping up ahead.\n\nRob seems acutely aware that I’m not messing around. As soon as we roll to a halt, I throw my door open and jump onto the dusty roadside, striding over to the rest of the convoy, who are just starting to get out of their own cars. I’m conscious of a driving anger behind each step I take.\n\n**AS:** You didn’t tell him.\n\n**CLYDE:** Bristol, I…\n\n**ROB:** What’s goin’ on Bristol?\n\nRob’s marches up behind me, more than a little restless to get a grip on my motives.\n\n**AS:** Clyde?\n\nClyde looks around a circle of expectant eyes. When he delivers his answer, he’s unable to meet any of them.\n\n**CLYDE:** Bonnie… Bonnie talked to the hitchhiker.\n\nRob’s expression shifts, his confusion degrading into a solemn understanding.\n\n**ROB:** God… ahh Goddamnit. You knew about this Bristol?\n\n**AS:** I told them to tell you the morning of the third day. I saw them go over to you I… I thought they did.\n\n**CLYDE:** Bonnie… thought you’d… turn us around.\n\n**ROB:** Well she’s was damn right. You seen what happens when the rules get broken. You shoulda told me as soon as you saw me and headed right back home.\n\n**CLYDE:** That was before Ace… before everything. I didn’t know this place was-\n\n**ROB:** The rules are the rules Clyde! Is anything even wrong with Bonnie? You said she gets confused... was that a lie?\n\nClyde doesn’t answer, avoiding Rob’s glare. As I process what Rob’s just said, I have to say I’m surprised by the deviousness of the two siblings.\n\nWhen I thought they were telling Rob about the hitchhiker, it appears they’d instead told him that Bonnie was, to some degree, senile. It was a simple lie, but one that would adequately explain her odd behaviour, draw sympathy from Rob and, most ingeniously, prevent him from telling me about their conversation. A truth buried beneath an unpleasant lie, its subject matter just uncomfortable enough to head off any chance of discussion.\n\nStill, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\n\n**CLYDE:** We can head home if you want.\n\n**BONNIE:** No.\n\nThe group turns to Bonnie. She speaks in a tone more decisive than I thought her capable.\n\n**BONNIE:** He... the hitchhiker... he was talking about a… about the village we just passed. I was looking forward to seeing it, that’s all. I’m ok really.\n\n**AS:** You’ve been talking about it a lot Bonnie.\n\n**BONNIE:** It just sounded like a lovely place, I was sad that we passed it by. I’m sorry for worrying everyone. Please don’t make us turn around Rob.\n\nRob stares at them both. His position has been made crystal clear.\n\n**ROB:** We’re stopping a little early today. Come the rest of the way with us, rest up… then tomorrow you both go home. You should count yourselves lucky you get the chance to turn around.\n\nRob marches back to the Wrangler, signalling that the discussion is over.\n\n**ROB:** Lilith, you’re with us.\n\nLilith doesn't even try to hide her relief as she shuffles away from Bonnie & Clyde and climbs into the back of the Jeep. It’s a little heart warming that Rob still has the awareness to look out for her, angry as he may be.\n\nAs well as his surprising strength, I also tend to forget how perceptive he can be.\n\nBonnie, Clyde and Bluejay climb back into their respective vehicles. I catch Bonnie’s eye, the moment before she returns to the Ford. She appears truly disappointed, but otherwise resigned to keep going, satisfied to let Wintery Bay fade into the distance. It’s comforting to hear that she’s ready to put the place behind her.\n\nIt’s just a pity I don’t believe a word of it.\n\n*****\n\n**LILITH:** It was fucking weird Bristol.\n\nLilith seems happy to be in the Wrangler, enjoying the sense of security the modded behemoth affords, and also greatly relieved to be away from Bonnie & Clyde. She’s spent the last five minutes detailing the thirty second argument that unfolded between them, charting its disturbing nuances as well as it’s eerie conclusion.\n\n**LILITH:** ... but I swear she was basically like crying like… she didn’t understand how we could be going the wrong way. But then like, as soon as you pulled us over and she just stopped. Like I mean… stopped.\n\n**AS:** That must have been disconcerting.\n\n**LILITH:** You have no idea... So Rob, when are these cornfields gonna fucking end?\n\n**ROB:** Soon. We’re gonna rest up for the night in a few turns. Then tomorrow it won’t be long until we’re on a track through the woods.\n\n**LILITH:** The fucking woods? Are you kidding? Are we talking like… Sleepy Hollow bleeding trees or what?\n\n**ROB:** Hah, wish I could tell ya.\n\n**LILITH:** Wait, what do you mean?\n\n**ROB:** I ain’t been that far yet. It’s new territory.\n\n**LILITH:** Oh… great. Maybe the cornfields aren’t so…\n\nLilith goes quiet, transfixed by something in the rear view mirror, before quickly turning around to get a better look out of the back window.\n\nThe car behind us is out of control.\n\nBonnie is fighting to wrest the steering wheel from her brother. The Ford swerves erratically behind us, driven mad by the dynamic power struggle taking place inside it. Rob sharply accelerates out of the way as the car behind lurches drunkenly to and fro before skidding to a shuddering halt. Rob hits the brake hard, and by the time I’ve turned in his direction, he’s already slammed the door of the Wrangler, storming across the tarmac to Bonnie and Clyde. \n\n**ROB:** Cut the engine!\n\nThe Ford’s engine goes silent and in the absence of its rumbling growl, new sounds emerge. The sounds of a struggle, and of wild desperate screaming.\n\nStepping out of the car for the second time today, I jump onto the road and cover the distance between us.\n\nRob is attempting to pull a screeching Bonnie from the car. Even with his impressive strength it seems to be a challenge. Bonnie claws at the walls, trying with all her might to regain her grasp on the steering wheel.\n\n**BONNIE:** Please! PLEASE! Let me go! Let me go! \n\nRob extracts Bonnie from the car and attempts to subdue her amidst a flurry of flailing hands and elbows. She writhes and kicks as he pins her arms to her sides.\n\n**AS:** Bonnie! Bonnie. Calm down ok? Let’s talk this through.\n\n**BONNIE:** He told me it was on our way! He said we’d pass through!\n\n**ROB:** He lied Bonnie.\n\n**BONNIE:** No… no we’re going the wrong way. We’re going the wrong way!\n\nBonnie lashes out again, striking at Rob’s legs with her own. Rob holds her firmly, hit teeth gritted through every impact.\n\nIt’s clear that Bonnie isn’t going to let up. I run back to the Wrangler and open up the trunk. After a few moments of rummaging through my bag, I find the first aid kit and pull out an unopened pack of white zip ties.\n\n**AS:** Clyde, open the back door.\n\nRob sees me standing with the zip ties. Even in the midst of Bonnie’s incessant struggle, he looks at me with an almost questioning air, as if he’s wondering how we ever arrived at this point. As if he’s asking whether we can really do what I’m wordlessly suggesting.\n\nBonnie answers the last question for him. In the slim few seconds of distraction, she slams her head back into his nose, eliciting a disgustingly loud thud and a pained growl from Rob. Dazed and confused, his nose immediately fountaining blood, Rob manages to keep his arms wrapped around her. But it’s clear this isn’t going to be sustainable, and that she isn’t anywhere close to calming down.\n\nClyde has opened the door, stepping back and looking on like a frightened child as we carry Bonnie over to the back seat of the Ford. I lean in before him, adjusting the headrest until it’s pressed against the ceiling, ensuring that it can’t be removed from the bracket. I then loop a zip tie around each bracket and fasten them.\n\n**BLUEJAY:** What the fuck is going on?\n\nBluejay has stepped out of her car, making her way towards us. I realise that, to someone who is fighting to not believe in any of this, the following scene would appear at best as a melodramatic farce, and at worst, as the attempted detention of an innocent and distressed woman.\n\nSadly, I don’t have time to field her questions. I climb into the car. Bonnie working constantly against us as Rob eases her in after me, his hand on her head to prevent it bumping against the top of the doorframe.\n\nOnce she’s inside, I loop a second zip tie around the one I’ve already fastened on the right bracket, forcing her right hand inside it. I pull the plastic tab over the sleeve of her jumper.\n\nI hope it’s not too tight, but at the very least it’s secure enough to keep her in place. Bonnie continues to pull against the zip ties, but it’s clear her strength has been sapped from her spirited battle with Rob.\n\nNot quite able to look her in the eye, I push a pile of luggage out of the way and climb out the other side of the Ford. Rob and I are both getting our breath back, the former pinching his nose and adjusting stoically to the fresh pain.\n\n**BLUEJAY:** Hey what the fuck are… you’re not going to leave her like that are you?\n\n**AS:** Get back in your car Bluejay.\n\nI walk back to the Wrangler, tuning out Denise’s coarse protests. Rob reaches into the Jeep’s still open trunk, and pulls out a pile of blankets and pillows. In the rear view mirror, I can see him placing them on Bonnie’s lap, giving her a place to rest her elbows.\n\nShe leans her forehead against the back of the headrest. Even with her face blocked from view, I can tell that she’s crying.\n\nWe arrive at the rest stop some twenty minutes later, the vague outline of a deep green forest blooming on the horizon. It’s earlier in the day than we would usually stop. Rob tells us he wants the entirety of tomorrow to chart the woods, as well as good time to turn back before night fall should the need arise. I’m not complaining, I’m glad of the chance to rest up following today’s events.\n\nFor the rest of the day, we take it in turns to keep an eye on Bonnie, making sure she has everything she needs. When the Ford pulled up alongside us, Lilith, Rob, and I expected to see a quivering wreck, tugging ceaselessly against her bonds. We were all surprised, and more than a little disturbed, to find her smiling. By the time my turn comes around, the sun is already dipping in the sky. Rob has prepared a small pot of miso soup in case anyone can bring themselves to eat. I finish my bowl, all too aware of how unnecessary each meal now feels, and pour out a helping for Bonnie.\n\nI find her in good spirits.\n\n**BONNIE:** How are you doing Alice?\n\n**AS:** I’m fine. How are you doing Linda?\n\n**BONNIE:** I’m ok. Sorry for giving you all such a fright earlier. I feel terrible.\n\n**AS:** It’s fine honestly. I’m sorry about… about all this.\n\nI gesture to the zip tied restraints. Rob has reapplied them, fastening bandages underneath the straps to afford Bonnie a modicum of comfort. Still the scene rings with a sinister barbarity which no kind consideration can make up for. \n\n**BONNIE:** It’s ok. I wasn’t myself.\n\n**AS:** I brought you soup. I know you might not be hungry.\n\n**BONNIE:** No no I’d love some, thank you. Everyone’s being so lovely.\n\n**AS:** Well, we just want to make sure you’re alright.\n\nI submerge the spoon, drench up a measure of warm broth, and begin to raise it towards her.\n\n**BONNIE:** Oh no you don’t have to… I can feed myself…\n\nShe gestures to her bound hands, the clear implication hanging in the air.\n\n**AS:** No I… I don’t mind. I think it’s-\n\nBonnie throws her weight sideways, her elbow jabbing outwards and hitting the bowl out of my hands. Soup spills over my fleece, just a little cooler than scolding hot, and soaks immediately into the fabric. I back away reflexively, and watch Bonnie’s expression flicker like a faulty lightbulb from kind tranquility to utter, burning contempt. It’s gone as quickly as it appears, just in time for the rest of the group to look our way.\n\n**BLUEJAY:** What are you doing with her?!\n\nBluejay storms across from her car, angrily drawing from a Marlboro and forcing the smoke draconically back into the air.\n\n**AS:** Nothing. Just an accident.\n\n**BONNIE:** It’s ok Bluejay, it was my mistake.\n\n**BLUEJAY:** Did she get any on you?\n\nBluejay leans in placing her hand comfortingly on Bonnie’s, before turning to fix me with a murderous stare. It’s almost impressive how, even when caring for someone, Bluejay still manages to be simultaneously venomous to those around her.\n\n**BONNIE:** No no it’s ok it was my fault. It’s fine. I’m sorry for causing trouble.\n\nBluejay laughs at Bonnie’s submissive apology, unable to believe what she's thinking. Her eyes remain fixed on me.\n\n**BLUEJAY:** You’re a fucking coward. Look what he’s making you do. Look!\n\nMy eyes follow where she gestures. I have to admit the helpless figure of Bonnie, restrained in the back seat of the Ford, rings with an innate inhumanity, and being forced to stare my actions in the face makes me feel utterly ghoulish.\n\nThe choices I’ve made must seem insane to Bluejay, but that doesn’t mean hers are not. Despite her pretensions of rationality, I can’t help but feel that Bluejay’s actions are simply being governed by a different insanity. An insanity borne out of the desperate need to explain the unexplainable, which has morphed into an ugly cocktail of paranoia, self-grandeur, and fervent antagonism.\n\nBluejay notes my silent expression, most likely taking it as a personal victory. Without another word she returns to her car and shuts herself inside, festering silently and alone.\n\n**BONNIE:** Do you want to know what’s wonderful Alice?\n\nBonnie leans towards me, lowering her voice so no one else can hear.\n\n**BONNIE:** He told me there’s a house… waiting for me. My home by the sea.\n\n**AS:** I’m sorry Bonnie. I don’t think there is.\n\n**BONNIE:** It’s going to be a such a beautiful place. Such a beautiful place.\n\nBonnie flashes me a broad grin. \n\n**BONNIE:** It’s been lovely knowing you Alice.\n\nBonnie turns away from me, placing her forehead back on the headrest. The grin doesn’t fade as I turn away. I walk back to the Wrangler, faced with the choice of changing into new clothes or my thermal pyjamas.\n\nAfter removing my fleece and lying down for a just a moment, I end up sleeping in the clothes I’m wearing.\n\n*****\n\nWhen I wake up, the Wrangler is moving. \n\nThe air mattress reverberates and my body rocks as we make a sharp U-turn. I sit bolt upright, Lilith waking up next to me, similarly bleary eyed and confused.\n\nRob is behind the wheel. The gear stick shakes as he transports us down the road at incredible speed.\n\n**AS:** Rob what’s happening?\n\n**ROB:** Bonnie got herself free. She’s headed for the turn.\n\nI pull myself into the passenger seat, suddenly wide awake.\n\n**LILITH:** What? How did she get free?\n\n**AS:** Is she with Clyde?\n\n**ROB:** She hit him over the head, dragged him outta the car. I couldn’t wait for him, but he’s catchin’ up.\n\nLilith and I turn around. Bluejay’s car is gaining on us, a distant pair of high beams steadily drowning the rear window in light.\n\n**LILITH:** Why’s Bluejay helping him?\n\n**AS:** She probably wants to keep an eye on us. Rob, do you think we’ll catch up with Bonnie?\n\n**ROB:** I’m workin’ on it.\n\nThe Wrangler continues to rocket through the darkness. We keep our eyes fixed forward, scanning the very edge of the horizon for any sign of Bonnie’s Ford.\n\nWhen Bluejay pulls alongside us, I get a look at the pair. Bluejay is nought but steely determination, dedicated to reaching Bonnie before we do. Clyde looks mortified, rocked by his sister’s actions, a small contusion on his head to mark her vicious betrayal.\n\nRob screeches to a halt once we arrive at the junction. Bluejay’s headlights are already illuminating the road to Wintery Bay, and Rob’s lighting rig coats the entire area in an artificial twilight. In the middle of it all, we see Bonnie, standing next to her car, smiling.\n\nShe’s already beyond the threshold of the turn.\n\n**CLYDE:** Linda! Linda, please… come on back now, ok?\n\n**BONNIE:** You can all come with me. There’s a place for all of us. He told me. There’s a place for everyone.\n\n**CLYDE:** Please Linda. You have to come back.\n\nA strange trail of black dust is streaming off Bonnie’s skin, rising into the air and dancing in the breeze. After a moment, it becomes clear that the edges of Bonnie are slowly degrading, converting quietly into dark ash and drifting into the atmosphere.\n\n**BONNIE:** I love you very much Martin. You’re always welcome.\n\n**CLYDE:** No please… please.\n\nBonnie turns around and climbs into the car. Without looking back, she pulls away down the road to Wintery Bay. The trail of black particles rise from the Ford as she goes, with greater and greater volume as the entire car starts to wither away before our eyes. Less than a minute later the Ford, with Bonnie inside it, gradually dissolves into dust and scatters to the winds.\n\nClyde doesn't speak. His entire being is quiet. Lilith immediately runs back to the Wrangler. Rob waits a while, staring at he dancing cloud of dust, before putting his arm around Clyde and gently escorting him to the Jeep. \n\nAs I turn away from the road to Wintery Bay, I take note of Bluejay’s reaction. She looks absolutely petrified, more so than I’ve ever seen her. She impulsively removes the pack of Marlboros from her pocket and holds them in her hands, before quickly returning them, unsmoked.\n\nThe night passes slowly after we return to the rest stop. All of us are exhausted, and more than willing to surrender to the escapism of sleep. Rob rests in the driver’s seat, giving up his space on the air mattress to Clyde. Everyone drops quickly enough into a quiet slumber, leaving me awake with only my thoughts for company. I find myself thinking of Bluejay, of how she could possibly hope to rationalise the disintegration of Bonnie and her car. \n\nI wonder how I’d feel if the Left\/Right Game were exposed as some unparalleled magic trick. Would I feel foolish? No I don’t think so. Impressed, maybe. Relieved? Most definitely. In fact, the more I think about it, the more I miss the innocent days when I believed the game was a hoax. I suppose I see why Bluejay is so adamant about dismissing this place; trickery however elaborate is almost always a preferable alternative to genuine horror.\n\nThe Jeep’s door opens and shuts \n\nPart of me tries to ignore it, to wash my hands of any other developments in this harrowing night. However, exiled as I am from the kingdom of sleep, I slowly find myself sitting up, quietly putting on my boots, and letting myself out.\n\nI step out into the cool night, observing the figure before me.\n\n**AS:** Where are you going Clyde?\n\nClyde turns to face me, I initially interpret the look he gives me as one of resignation, but the word doesn’t quite fit. Resignation is a defeat, the world exacting compliance from you against your own wishes. But the man before me is as calm as the night air around him. His wishes are clearly his own. There’s no defeat in his eyes, but something else entirely… peace, maybe.\n\n**CLYDE:** You know where I’m going Alice.\n\nClyde speaks softly, a quiet conviction behind every word he says. I briefly glance towards the Wrangler, wondering if I’m really equipped to handle this on my own.\n\n**CLYDE:** Don’t call Rob. I made a mistake coming back to the rest stop. I shouldn’t have done... please. Just let me go.\n\n**AS:** Clyde, just wait for tomorrow ok? He’ll understand. He’ll turn us around and take you home.\n\n**CLYDE:** It won't be home anymore.\n\nClyde’s gentle stare renders me silent.\n\n**CLYDE:** Linda had a husband once. He was a good man. Died young. She could never bring herself to go looking again and I… I never found who I was looking for. We’ve been by each other’s side for sixty years. Sixty years. I gotta be honest, even after all we’ve been through, everything you and I have seen, I never felt like I was in a new world until now.\n\n**AS:** I don’t think I can’t let you do this Clyde.\n\n**CLYDE:** I’m sorry Alice, but it’s not up to you.\n\nClyde breathes in the cool night air, exhaling through his nose.\n\n**CLYDE:** I yelled at her to come back, when she ran off to rob that ice cream parlour. I kept calling out and calling out. I spent so much energy trying to get her to come back to me. After a while I realised she wasn’t coming back… that I’d have to follow her. I should’ve realised it earlier. That’s all I can do.... follow where she goes.\n\nClyde looks at me, almost apologetically.\n\n**CLYDE:** Goodbye Alice.\n\nHe turns away from the convoy and wanders back down the road.\n\n**AS:** Clyde.\n\nHe turns around one last time.\n\n**AS:** Do you want company?\n\nIt takes roughly an hour for us to walk back to the junction. In the time we have, I’m treated to the story of Bonnie and Clyde. The warmest fragments of their life together, the moments that built them, the waves that rocked them and the places they once called home. I don’t think I’ll ever agree with what Clyde is doing, but the more he talks, the more I understand.\n\nHis stories span more than half a century, supported by a transient cast of acquaintances and friends, but at the core of each tale is a pair of siblings who meant the world to one another. The pair existed as two relative souls, quantifiable only in relation to each other. In the absence of one, the remnant was indefinable. A drifting point, unanchored in space.\n\nThe story ends just as we reach the junction\n\n**AS:** I hope she's out there.\n\n**CLYDE:** I hope so too. Thank you for coming with me, I know it’s late.\n\n**AS:** No… it’s never a bad time to see a friend off.\n\nClyde smiles at me one last time before turning to face the road. He steps over the threshold, past the old wooden sign. In the silence of the night, I hear nothing but his soft footsteps and the quiet breeze, which after a few minutes carries the last of him into an open sky.\n\nIt’s a long walk back to the convoy. My mind is numb to fear as I make my way through the dark, the corn rustling in the wind beside me.\n\nIt’s been four days since I arrived at Rob Guthard’s house, sat down at his table, and listened to him speak about the new world he’d discovered. In that time, I’ve seen things I can’t hope to comprehend, sights that exist beyond the spectrum of our reality. Things I wouldn't have deemed possible.\n\nFor all I know there is a Wintery Bay, and Bonnie has already arrived at her house by the sea, standing at the door, waiting with quiet confidence for her brother’s arrival.\n\nI may never know. But I do hope they find each other, wherever they may be."},"298":{"title":"Every month a parade would pass through my hometown, but we were never allowed to look at it","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/bk0322\/every_month_a_parade_would_pass_through_my\/","flair":null,"author":"EaPAtbp","selftext":"I’ve lived in Arizona for the past fifteen years of my life, but I had a very different life before that. I used to live in a small town, in the middle of nowhere. I couldn’t even tell you what side of the country it’s on, or if it even is in the United States. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was a small forest town with dense trees in all directions, but where exactly this particular forest is, well, your guess is as good as mine. The only thing I know for certain in the name of the town; Point Pine. I lived in Point Pine for the first ten years of my life, before we moved the summer after my tenth birthday. Once we left, my parents never spoke of it again. In fact, they acted as if it never even existed, and to them, I guess it didn’t. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don’t really blame them either. I caught on pretty quickly and realized that they were trying their hardest to forget the memory of Point Pine. Whenever kids at school asked me where I was from, I simply told them I was from a small town that they had never heard of. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also learned early on that any questions about Point Pine would be met with punishments. A few months after we moved to Arizona, my older sister Felicity had a school project about family history. She did it on our life in Point Pine and wrote about some of the things she remembered from there. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur mom found her project the day before she turned it in and burned it in the backyard. When Felicity came home that afternoon, my parents took her up to her bedroom, where I heard Felicity crying out every few minutes in what I assume was pain. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI said nothing, and from that moment on, neither one of us mentioned Point Pine again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nExcept for me, right now. I’ve decided to tell all of you about it. I don’t know what is causing me to remember all these things that I had locked up in the deepest parts of my brain. Maybe it’s the fact that my father died about a week ago. Since he died, my mom has remained silent; hasn’t said a word to anyone. She hasn’t even cried. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn fact, she ended up sending my father's remains off to god knows where (my money in on Point Pine, although I’d be crazy to ask). I’ve started recalling random little things about the town that, at the time, seemed like normal everyday things that we as residents were all used to. Now, as I look back, I realize that they’re not as normal as I thought back then. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne peculiar thing about Point Pine had to do with the Point Pine Bakery. Whenever you went in there, the owner, Mr. Terrance, always knew what you were about to order. I remember the kids having some sort of rumor about Mr. Terrance being a magician who could read minds. Also, whenever you paid for your baked goods, you had to tip Mr. Terrance with an old item of clothing that you had grown out of. There was a giant box up by the register that everyone tossed old baby clothing and shoes into. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat was one of the odd things; although you’ll come to realize that it won’t seem that weird in comparison to some of the other things about Point Pine. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEvery year on your birthday, you had to get bloodwork done. I don’t think anyone really knew what the point of this was, or if they were actually looking for something. We just all knew that our birthdays would start off with a trip to the Point Pine Labs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEveryone had to be up at 8:13 am. There was a system of speakers placed around the town like an amusement park or something, and at 8:13 am, without fail, the wailing alarm sound would ricochet through the neighborhoods, waking everybody up. This was followed by parents running to wake up their children and get them out of bed as quickly as possible like the house was on fire or something. Sometimes I expected it to be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll the Point Pine schools were placed in different areas of the town. Point Pine Elementary was towards the east side, Point Pine Middle School was in the West, Point Pine High was in the dead center of town, and Point Pine University was up on a small hill towards the south. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you hadn’t noticed by now, every place in town was named “Point Pine \\_\\_\\_\\_”. The Point Pine Cafe, Point Pine Mall, Point Pine Grocery, etc, etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCertainly, one of the weirdest things by far that took place in Point Pine, was the Point Pine Monthly Parade. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt happened every month; without fail. It was never on the same date, and each month, a student from Point Pine High was chosen to be in it. The weird thing about this parade was that we weren’t allowed to watch it go by. Not out on the streets, not from the windows, and not even on television. That was one of the most enforced rules; you must never, under any circumstance, look at the parade. In fact, for the most part, we weren’t even allowed outside when the parade passed through. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe always knew when the parade was about to start because it always happened the same way. You would hear a chorus of voices, like a church choir, singing a melody. It wasn’t a familiar one that I knew (I was only familiar with it in the sense that I heard it once a month). It sounded like it could be from a nursery rhyme or something similar. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe voices seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere all at once. It was like they were coming from the sky, the ground, the trees, the buildings; like everything in Point Pine was singing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce you heard the first note, you had five minutes to get inside a house or a building that had locks on the doors. This might come as a surprise, but in Point Pine, not many buildings contained locks. So, if you happened to be out and about on the street when the singing started, you had about three options on the places you could go; one of the schools, the staff break room in the Point Pine bar, or the fridge in the Point Pine Pizza Shop. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne year in the month of August, my friend Lee and I decided that we were going to break the rules and not go inside when the parade passed. Now that I think about it, I’m surprised that kids didn’t do this more often, considering that well, when you tell kids that they must absolutely never do something...they often do that exact thing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince we didn’t know when the parade was coming, where it started, or the exact path that it took around town, we decided the smartest thing to do would be to wait in the forest near the Point Pine Library until the parade eventually came down that street. So, we basically decided to spend about half of the month of August hanging out near or around the library. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAround the third week of the month, while we were sitting on the steps of the library talking about some random things that aren’t important, we heard the music start. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLee and I looked at each other and then took off running into the trees, while everyone else raced to the nearest school. We went far enough into the forest that someone on the street wouldn’t see us, but stayed close enough so that we were still able to see a part of the road. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe waited for a while, whispering to each other and then shushing one another as we waited for the infamous parade to pass. This year, my sister’s friend Reid was chosen to work on the parade. She was a few years older than my sister, but they were friends because Reid used to live next door to us when we were younger. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe were crouching in the bushes and leaves when we heard the chorus of voiced getting louder and therefore closer. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Dude, I totally see it!” Lee hissed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI straightened my back a little bit in my crouched position to try to see what Lee was seeing. I was always a short kid, even now I’m shorter than most guys my age- or any age really- so Lee always pretty much towered over me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“I can’t see anything!” I hissed, shifting my position. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Shh! They might hear us!” Lee hissed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI stopped moving and instead waited for them to get closer, where they were bound to pass right in front of my line of sight. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Oh no. Oh crap!” Suddenly, Lee dove to the ground, landing in the fetal position, with his head cradled in his hands. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“What?” I asked, looking from him to the street. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“I saw her! I saw that girl!” He exclaimed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Reid?” I asked, looking over to try to spot her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLee grabbed me and slammed me down to the ground. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Ow!” I exclaimed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“What was that for?” I asked. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“You don’t want to look at it.” Lee replied.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI noticed that for the first time in all of the years that I had known him, Lee looked absolutely terrified. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI turned my back on the parade and sat down to look at Lee instead. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“What did you see?” I whispered. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Those things, they did something to her. They’re eating her, Cody. But she doesn’t even care.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI looked at Lee, who still had his head in his hands, and he was crying now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI sat with my back to the parade, no longer wanting to see. I heard the singing get louder, \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Cody…” I heard the voices calling. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Don’t look.” Lee whispered. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Cody...Cody…” Now the voice sounded like Reid. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Look at us, Cody…” \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI shut my eyes. The voices went on for a few minutes longer, and at one point, Lee started wailing. I kept my eyes shut the entire time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter that, it moved along and continued its way through town. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce we began to hear everyone come out of their hiding places, I stood up and leaned down to help Lee get up. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce he stood up, he kept his head down. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Lee, what’s wrong?” I asked. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI could hear him sniffling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“Lee?”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe finally responded as he lifted his head. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n“It took my eyes.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will never forget the dark, bleeding holes in Lee’s face and the cuts around his skin. I threw up in the forest for a good three minutes, before I was able to help lead Lee out of the forest. A few adults saw us and got our parents, who came and got us right away. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe day after that, my family moved out of Point Pine. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI never knew what became of Lee after that day. Minutes after we left, my parents acted like Point Pine never existed. It was never discussed, and I never had the nerve to ask about Lee again. As far as I know, Lee was the only person who ever saw the parade, and he was never able to see anything else after that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don’t know if Point Pine still exists, I’d like to go check it out again, but even if I knew where it was or how to get there, I don’t think I’d ever go back. I have a feeling that I wouldn’t exactly get a warm welcome. Although, I can't shake the thought that my parents were somehow still connected to the town, even after all those years."},"299":{"title":"A recipe for happiness","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/9ertpa\/a_recipe_for_happiness\/","flair":null,"author":"Dopabeane","selftext":"On my tenth birthday, I picked a dog from the pound. The pound had several beautiful dogs – huskies and German shepherds, sleek bluenose pit bulls and even a redbone hound – but the dog that caught my eye was a bowlegged teacup Chihuahua with wiry fur and ears that seemed to sprout from his neck.\n\nHis fur was prickly and he smelled like soggy corn chips. He also ate flies, snatching them out of the air like a clumsy frog.\n\nSo I named him Renfield.\n\nBack then, we lived on five acres of golden forest. My favorite spot on the property was a hollow inside a wild hedge. It was the perfect hideout; you could only access the hollow by crawling along a hidden trench because the branches formed a thick, dangerous interlock on all sides.\n\nI took Renfield inside the hedge that night. I remember the way sunlight shafted through the leaves and flowers, turning the space into a burrow of soft brown shadows overlaid with coppery light. My little dog looked up at me, eyes shining like amber in the dim. \n\nI petted him until he fell asleep. Then I crawled out of the hollow and called his name, intending to confuse him.\n\nHe panicked immediately, yelping and clawing madly at the impenetrable branches.\n\nHis terror felt like a gut punch. I crawled back into the hedge. The way he looked at me is burned into my memory: wide-eyed and joyfully relieved, but terrified. \n\nThat look was all I could think of the day I put him to sleep.\n\nI didn’t have a choice; I’d have him for eighteen years, and had medicated severe heart issues for four of those. He was in constant pain, so it was time.\n\nBut he knew something was wrong. He was so scared, and I scared him even more by crying. Tears always terrified him. \n\nI tried to push away the memory of that first night in the hedge, of the way I’d scared him. But I couldn’t, and no wonder. Putting him to sleep, I’d trapped him again.\n\nOnly this time, I had to leave him behind.\n\nHe was my last lifeline. I felt him slipping away as surely as a drowning man feels a wave carry away his life preserver.\n\nMy crybaby tendencies didn’t start or end with my dog. Take my dad. He’d been in a nursing home for years by that point. He developed Alzheimer’s early. The descent was brutal and swift. As if that wasn’t enough, he had pancreatic cancer – automatically terminal and unimaginably excruciating.\n\nI stopped visiting around that time. Not because I didn’t want to see him, but because I couldn’t do it to him. Just try to imagine – you’re in horrific pain, you don’t know who or where you are, and your only visitor is a gaunt stranger who bursts into tears whenever they see you.\n\nI scared him to death whenever I visited. I made his disorienting, painful days that much worse. Stole what little peace he had.\n\nSo I stopped.\n\nI meant to sit with him at the end, when he’d be in a drug-induced sleep so deep he wouldn’t notice me holding his hands and sobbing. But I wasn’t there when he died. I was at my doctor’s office, digesting the news that I, too, was going to be sick for the rest of my life. \n\nI dreamed about my dad that night. He was trapped in the hedge and screaming for help. I tried to show him the way out for what felt like hours, but I was invisible. He couldn’t see me or hear me. As far as he knew, he was alone. Somehow, in that irrepressible logic of dreams, I knew it was my fault.\n\nI woke up crying.\n\nIt was enough. I’d had *enough*.\n\nI’m not stupid or naïve. Life is a tide. And the shitty truth is some of us live on a stormy coast.\n\nI knew this.\n\nBut I wanted a break. Just a couple of hours where I didn’t feel sad.\n\nSo I went online, hoping to stumble on some kind of guided imagery technique or hypnotic ASMR. Something to create an artificially happy place, at least for a little while.\n\nI tried everything. Nothing worked. I kept searching anyway, trawling increasingly weird websites far into the night because the search itself was addicting. Not a happy place, but certainly a distracting one.\n\nSometime in the middle of the fifth night, I found an ancient Geocities page titled:\n\n*a recipe for happiness*\n\nI clicked, of course.\n\n*Are you tired of feeling bad? Want to cheer up? Well have I got good news for you. My friend gave me this RECIPE FOR HAPPINESS that works like a charm!*\n\n*There are TWO PARTS to the Recipe*\n\nWhat followed was a pretty standard honey cake recipe, although the last instructions gave me pause:\n\n*Mix the ingredients together in a glass bowl, then spit in the mixture*\n\n*Cook at whatever temperature you want for EXACTLY 20 minutes*\n\n*Cut in half. Put half outside your door. Eat the other half during…*\n\n*PART TWO!!*\n\n*Take one HAPPY MEMORY and MEDITATE*\n\n*Think of someone who makes you happy*\n\n*Plan a perfect day*\n\n*Go to sleep thinking about your perfect day*\n\n*Do this and your sorrow will be eaten away!!!*\n\nIt made me smile. Eating cake while meditating on happier times wasn’t bad advice. So I gave it a try. I even spit in the cake batter.\n\nI cut the cake and set half of it on the porch. Tendrils of steam twirled into the darkness, lit pale silver by the full moon. \n\nI curled up the couch to eat the remaining half. For my happy memory, I chose that first evening in the hollow: my little dog, lit to soft brilliance by the dying sun.\n\nAs for someone who made me happy, I picked my dad.\n\nThen I planned a perfect day. Or rather, remembered it.\n\nI’d just started my first real job, and still lived with my parents. I’d had a good day at work. My dog met me in the driveway, prancing and wiggling like he hadn’t seen me for years. Dad cooked an early dinner and told jokes while my mom played her guitar. It rained that night. We went out to the porch, watching palm trees sway as torrents poured down. My dog was scared, so I picked him up and held him as thunder roared.\n\nAfterward, we ate brownies and ice cream. Then I settled in for the night and read a book until I fell asleep, with my dog cured at my feet.\n\nAs I drifted off, smiling at the memory, I swore I could feel him there: warm and surprisingly heavy, sprawling lazily over my toes. \n\nWhen I woke, that warm weight had shifted to my pillow.\n\nA terrible, painful hope coursed through me, one I couldn’t even acknowledge.\n\nI opened my eyes.\n\nSomething tiny lay on my pillow in a drying pool of blood. Fuzzy and weirdly dirty, exuding drifting grey filaments that sparkled in the sun. Three milky eyes glinted over a horror show of a snout: cracked and bleeding, bursting with an improbable cluster of human molars. \n\nIt blinked – each eye just slightly out of tandem, opening and closing with a soft, wet *click* - and smiled. Ropes of bloody drool leaked between its teeth. It placed two cold paws on my face.\n\nThen it lowered its mouth over my own and inhaled.\n\nBreath and blood and every organ in my body seemed to travel up my esophagus. Like God Himself was sucking my guts through a straw.\n\nI whipped my head from side to side as the awful bottleneck sensation intensified.  All my guts were coming up, and so were emotions - no, *memories*: half-forgotten nightmares. Painful images of my withered father. The last time I saw my mother, dressed for work and setting a bowl of oatmeal on the counter while driving rain fell.  And my dog, my poor little dog, trying to run from the needle up until the very end.  \n\nI screamed into the mouth of the monster. I expected it to fly off, but it *inflated*: a furry flesh balloon growing, growing, growing –\n\nWithout warning, it let go.\n\nI stumbled back, gagging. The monster – an engorged orb the size of a German Shepherd – simply smiled. Hazy morning light filtered through the window, bathing it in soft white.\n\nRage inexplicably built in my chest, growing exponentially every second.\n\n“Are,” it croaked, then burped.\n\nI wanted to kill it, to plunge my arms elbow-deep into its disgusting, distended body, and –\n\n“Are you sad?” it asked.\n\nA storm of emotion – rage, disgust, contempt, even hilarity – roiled through me. Overwhelming, overpowering, and paralyzing.\n\n“No. You have no sadness.” It poked its belly with a ridiculousy small hand. “I have it.”\n\nIt took a long, long time, but I finally realized that this absurd abomination hadn’t eaten my guts.\n\nIt ate my feelings.\n\nNo sadness. No pain. No more stinging memories. Rage and confusion, sure. But underneath that was a satisfied calm akin to bliss.\n\nI left it alone in my bedroom and went for a drive.\n\nWhen I came back, I asked, “What are you?”\n\n“A special treat,” it answered.\n\nI decided I’d had a psychotic break, and voluntarily checked myself into a hospital. After two days of assessments, they found nothing wrong. Why would they? I was on an even keel, basking in a curiously blank inner peace.\n\nWhen I got home, the monster was in my bed. Jolly, indecent roundness had withered to skeletal proportions. It looked awful. Starved. \n\n“I need,” it gasped. “I need, or you will suffer again.”\n\nThe prospect of returning to a life of despair, of *loss*, was crushing; I couldn’t even fathom how I’d survived it in the first, and felt I’d never be able to do it again.\n\nSo I knelt by the bed and opened my mouth. The monster latched on and inhaled. The unpleasant bottleneck sensation returned: like my insides were crowding my windpipe. And with it, memories and feelings: the rage I’d experienced upon meeting the monster; contempt at its ugliness; the fear of insanity. And more: my dog, old and grey, waddling happily after me. My father in his hospital bed, smiling uncertainly as he said my name for the last night. And more, and more –\n\nI wrenched away, gasping. The monster smiled, fat and rotund again.\n\nOver the following days, we developed a routine. I went to work and attended doctor appointments, even visited friends. Then I came home and let the monster extract my negative feelings. Bad client at work? Removed and forgotten before the memory could sink in. Friend who wouldn’t make eye contact? What did I care, my pet monster would take care of it like he took care of everything else.\n\nThat’s what it did, you see: removed the feelings, the vibrancy, the *pain,* from painful things. Over the course of several weeks, it removed everything; I knew, dimly, that I experienced awful things on a daily basis, but I didn’t *remember* them.\n\nThe monster removed triggers, too: before the year was up, the sight of my dog’s bed no longer made me cry. Photos of my parents held almost no interest; I flipped through them on a regular basis, skimming places and faces that had so recently crushed me.\n\nAll the while, that peaceable bliss intensified. I flitted through life in a pleasant haze of calmness. My work life improved. My supervisor started talking about a promotion because I was so unflappable, so decisive. My friends were able to look at me again. And – for the first time in months – I was confident enough to reach out to them. \n\nOne day as I drove home from work, I realized I hadn’t looked at my photos in a very long time. It’s not that I cared, exactly. But it was a deviation. Those things no longer caused me pain, and I had nothing better to do.  So why not view them?\n\nI got home and obediently kneeled. The monster – now the size of a horse, twisted and bent like a mutated spider – fixed its mouth over mine. I’d come to enjoy the process. It was uncomfortable and unpleasant, but familiar. And afterward, I always felt *happy*: peaceful, empty, and warm.\n\nWhen it finished, I opened my mother’s photo album and began to browse.\n\nAfter a while, I realized I didn’t recognize anybody. I remembered remembering them.\n\nBut I didn’t remember them.\n\nThe stout man with curly hair like mine, the athletic woman who smiled like me, and the numerous people who wove in and out of this photographic narrative…they all were strangers. \n\nI reached a picture of my ten-year-old self cuddling a ragged, homely Chihuahua. Ghosts of memories tickled my brain, urging me to remember, urging me to *know.* \n\nAnd I understood, finally, that I had lost something.\n\nI don’t know why I cared. I felt so happy. Peaceful. My life was painless. I was great.\n\nBut I was also selfish. And I didn’t like the idea that the monster had taken so much.  Where was the line between happiness and emptiness? I didn’t want to be empty. I wanted to be full.\n\nSo, after many days of deliberation, I decided to make a change.\n\nI called off work, canceled much-needed doctor appointments, and settled in to search online.\n\n“What are you doing?” the monster asked.\n\n“Looking up some special recipes,” I said with a bland smile.\n\nIt took seven days, but I found the original recipe. At the bottom of the page was another entry:\n\n*a recipe for sadness*\n\nUnderneath were the words:\n\n*If you’re really dumb, you can undo happiness =( You shouldn’t, but it’s up to you. So here.*\n\n*Mix cake batter folloing the INSTRUCTIONS above*\n\n*Cut your hand and drip your blood into the batter*\n\n*Cook the cake as instructed Above*\n\n*Cut the cake in half*\n\n*Give half to your Happiness, and eat the other half*\n\n*Now here’s the sad part!!*\n\n*Remember the happy memory you meditated on*\n\n*Remember the person who made you happy*\n\n*Remember your perfect day*\n\n*Choose one to forget, OR…*\n\n*Choose to never be happy again*\n\n*Or better yet, don’t kill your happiness in the first place!*\n\nI agonized for days.\n\nMy monster – my happiness, my joy – continued to drain my pain, uncertainty, and fear. He quickly grew to three times his size.\n\nFinally, I made my decision.\n\nIt would be better to live in pain forever than to forget my father, my mother, or my dog.\n\nSo I followed the recipe: sweet honey cake, poisoned with blood instead of saliva. Then I cut it in half and brought it to my monster.\n\nI expected something awful. A fight that left my bloody shreds ground into the carpet. \n\nBut the monster only smiled. Round, flat eyes the size of dinner plates fixed on the blood cake. “What is that?”\n\n“A special recipe.” I gulped, but the beast was so focused on the cake that it didn’t notice. “Just for you.”\n\n“Thank you.” It opened its mouth.\n\nI placed the cake delicately on its tongue. It chewed eagerly, and shrank. Fat, firm sides caved, ragged rolls of empty flesh falling against its bones.\n\nPain built in my guts and chest, roiling and fluttering. Shivers wracked my spine. My warm, even-keeled peace shrank along with the monster that had granted it, leaving cold desolation in its place. \n\nBy the time the monster shriveled into a flat, boneless mass of dusty fur, I was prostrate on the floor, sobbing. Memories flooded back, pummeling me, leaving me breathless with pain. They pressed against me and threatened to explode *out* of me, pinning me in place. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t even dream of moving.\n\nI could only lay there and hurt.\n\nAfter my dad died, someone told me that pain is a fugue. It’ll break apart eventually, giving way to happiness again the way a nightmare opens to the morning. But my experience is opposite. There is no fugue. Sorrow is sharp, it is devastating, it is painfully present, and sometimes there’s no way out.\n\nThe recipe writer was right. I suffer every day, more than I did before. Like the universe is punishing me for those few months of stolen peace. It’s bad. So bad that sometimes I think I made the wrong choice. \n\nBut then I remember my dad. I remember my mom. I remember our perfect day filled with songs and bad jokes and warm, driving rain. \n\nI remember my dog, nestled in warm, coppery shadows.\n\nAnd even though I hurt, I am okay.\n"},"325":{"title":"Weird phone call?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/31lhc9\/weird_phone_call\/","flair":null,"author":"Cinastar","selftext":"So, I've got a story. There are complications I need to explain first for things to make full sense. Mainly that I'm not good at making friends, keeping them, socializing, ect. But, I am pretty good at online games. Kind of. Point is, throughout high school, I didn't have friends in real life. I had one for a few years I guess, but she chose her shitty ex-boyfriend over me, so. Whatever. Mainly I stuck with a group of people I met on the internet. Good, honest people. Still talk to most of them after 5-7 years.\n\nI had an online boyfriend at the time that I decided to move in with, and it wasn't on a whim, honest. I lived in Arkansas, and trust me, it's the shittiest place in the world. On top of all that, there was a bunch of family drama and depression going on. So a new state? Hell yes. I know him inside and out, and he knows me the exact same. Two months after graduating high school, I moved in with him and his family. We kinda broke up last year but we're still living together (separate rooms) and we're still really good friends. Anyway, I started playing this online game (P2P MMORPG to be exact) about right when I moved in. I was super addicted to it, and played it for the whole first year I lived with my ex. I'll call him Pat.\n\nOver that entire first year I had been playing that game, I didn't talk to anyone in-game. I didn't make any friends whatsoever. I eventually made two. We didn't play often, but when we did, I hadn't realized how much fun it was to play with friends again. One was a guy named Cody, the other a girl named Beth. They had been close friends for years prior to meeting me.\n\nBeth and I had this thing where we would go around in the towns of the game in skimpy clothing and recruit for our newly made guild. A cheap tactic, but we had so much shameful fun with it, we didn't care. Most of the time Cody would join our Skype calls and sigh deeply in the background of our incessant giggling. On our second recruitment spree, Beth ran across a male character and started flirting with him. This was our tactic, and we referred to it as 'reeling them in'. Eventually, I caught up with her and joined in. Soon enough, the guy had a friend of his join in, and his friend became my target. They were both already in a guild, but we tried to convince them to switch over to our side. In the end, we lost, but not without friend requests.\n\nI didn't expect anything of it, as I considered myself lucky to even make friends with Cody and Beth. A week or so later, I ran into their characters in town. We goofed around a bit, and soon Beth joined us too. A few hours of dancing in-game and Beth suggested I ask if they had Skype. I, being far too shy for that, protested and outright refused to do so. She kept prodding me the whole night about it, but I never did ask. \n\nThen a few days later, I ran into them again. They seemed quite the pair, never one without the other. I could tell they were really close friends. We goofed off for a little, as was usual for us, and then decided to do some dungeons together. They were good players, and it was easy to tell they had been playing the game for quite a while. After we had finished, the original guy's friend had to go to bed. I hung around with the first guy for a while until he asked me if I had a Skype. I felt a whole new kind of euphoria and excitement. I always do when I make a friend, like actually make one. One to the point where they actually want other means to contact me. So of course, I told him I did and gave him my skype handle.\n\nRight off the bat he wanted to call, and honestly I was pretty nervous. It took me days to start talking around Cody and Beth, and then days more to eventually become just a little bit comfortable. I mean, I wasn't even sure if this guy was an actual male in real life. Of course, there was no telling I was a girl in real life for him either, but I don't think he really cared. So after a bit of stumbling, I began to hold an actual conversation with him. God, I was out of my mind with anxiety but the guy was so charismatic and friendly, it was easily to feel comfortable.\n\nI learned that he was the same age as me, and his name was Jack. His friend was two years younger than him and named Kean. I told him about Beth and how we were pretty good friends outside of the game, even though we hadn't known each other long. Apparently Jack and Kean had been friends for several years, even having met in real life before. That explained why they were so attached to each other. I found it cute, honestly. \n\nThe next day over I met Kean, and he was much more of a soft-spoken, sweet kind of guy. Not nearly as outgoing as Jack was, but still more than willing to be friends. I couldn't describe to you how happy I was. Making friends is a huge thing to me, and when I do, I tend to cling to them pretty closely. Neither Jack nor Kean seemed to mind, although Jack had much more going on in real life than Kean or I did. I don't have a Facebook, but the both of them did and showed them to me, so they definitely were who they said they were. Honest to God good and friendly people. \n\nThis continued on for a few months. Sometimes Jack would be gone at conventions and the like for a few days, then come back and tell me all of the amazing people he met. I somehow knew I would never amount to the people he talked about. For one, Jack's a cosplayer. A pretty attractive guy. Me? I'm less than average and suffer from severe lack of self-confidence. All in all, I considered myself closer to Kean. We spent more time together and he was more like me. Reserved, bit quiet when we wanted to be. Soon, my ex Pat started to play the game with us. He also became good friends with Kean.\n\nPat and I agreed that Jack was... overly flirtatious. It was obvious he flirted with me just for fun. I always refused him, and never played along with it. But I never hated him for it. I found it more demeaning than anything, because I knew a guy like him would never be interested in me. I knew that was just in his personality though. It wasn't as if I could just say, hey, stop being who you are it's bothering me. I mean, I guess I could have but, it wasn't as if it were causing me serious discomfort or anything. I knew it was all a joke.\n\nI... tried my best not to think low of Jack. We would have long conversations about how lonely he was, and about how all of the relationships he had were based off physical aspects. Most of the time, I became his pillow of comfort. I'd tell him he was a good person, that someone would come along, that he shouldn't worry, he was still young. It never really worked. I suppose it staved off the loneliness for a little bit, but it always came back. I couldn't blame him though, I saw a lot of myself in him. I was the exact same way, except... no one really wanted me in any aspect. We were so similar in how we felt about things. The emotions he went through and explained to me countless times, I understood them all because I had felt the same things countless times before. I completely understood him, or I like to believe I did.\n\nThere was one day that Jack was discouraged over a girl he liked. Well, more discouraged than usual. He explained he was done with her, that he was going to 'hit some other girl up to see if she was with it'. That was just the way he talked. After all of the long talks we had had before over him being misunderstood by others, I tried not to think anything of it. He wasn't that shallow.. right? He didn't just want sex, he wanted an actual relationship. I tried hard to believe this, but as the conversation progressed, I started losing faith in that. I started to get disgusted. He wasn't saying things that were considered gentlemanly in the least. I was fed up with it and eventually stopped replying. \n\nI soon turned to Kean. I kept asking him why he thought Jack was a good person. Kean explained that Jack had always been there for him, paid for a ticket and hotel room just to meet him, and that he was better in every way. I felt... so incredibly disturbed talking to Kean. How could he say that Jack was better in every way? Kean wasn't like Jack at all. Kean was sweet, and cared so much about every little thing he said to Jack. There was a time they had a fight, and Kean was so beaten up over it that I had to keep him company so that he wouldn't tear himself apart. Kean denied everything that I told him Jack had said.\n\n \"He's joking. He doesn't mean it.\" I quickly retorted with nimble fingers, \"Didn't seem like it to me, not at all.\" Kean continued to reassure me. I couldn't really say much, Kean knew Jack better than me. Maybe he was right. Jack was just having a hard time. I tried not to act differently around him, but his image was already tainted.\n \n I talked to Pat about this too, and he agreed with me. He was a bit more harsh in regards to Jack, honestly, but I tried my best not to hate him. He was still my friend. \n \n Kean and I had agreed to join another server on our online game for when we were bored. It was a role playing server, so we made up new names, back stories and everything. We were both really excited about it. Kean began to play on that server a lot more often than our original one. Eventually, he started to drift off from me and Jack.\n \n Sometimes Kean would join our calls but simply remain silent as he typed away in reply to his new friends. I slowly accepted it. It's always been a fear of mine to lose friends after the shitty one from high school. As much as I wanted to believe it wouldn't happen, I was already prepared for it. I'm just that much of a pessimist. Jack on the other hand was pissed off about it. \"If he doesn't care, so what. We don't need him.\" It was kind of sad to see how easily Jack would throw him away. It was nothing compared to the way Kean felt about him.\n \n By this time, Jack and Kean had left their old guilds to join mine. We had reformed the whole thing, had plans for it. Of course... none of it ever happened. Kean was pretty much gone by now, saying he was busy every time I invited him to do something together. That was alright, I was growing used to his distance. \n \n One night, Jack and I were in a raid when we met someone in game that we decided to joke around with. At the end of the raid, I had jokingly suggested they join our server. Little did I know, this person actually took my suggestion seriously. Pat showed me the name of his character requesting to join our guild right as I was about to head to bed. I had a good laugh about it, and feeling great about meeting someone new again, fell asleep with a good feeling.\n \n The next day I started to get to know our new friend. His name was Curt, and was a bit older than all of us. The more I got to know him, the more I latched onto him. It's just what I do when I first meet someone. Several times Jack had tried to get my attention, but it ended up being bad timing. I was busy talking with Curt one night, then the next few I had to sleep early for work. I suppose I could have added Jack to the call with Curt but, every time we all were in a call it felt a bit awkward and strained. I don't think Jack liked Curt very well. I figured it was because I was no longer paying all of my attention to Jack, and I was kind of done with him acting like a kid about it.\n \n That weekend was a huge convention that Jack went off to. I was used to not talking to him for a few days because he was busy. It was never something that bothered me. I initiated conversation with Jack several times but we never really talked unless he initiated conversation with me. Mostly then it was about how sad he was feeling about this and that, and I kind of grew tired of it. This kid bitched about every little thing and hated his life over every small mishap that it made me so annoyed. Here I was, or still am technically, with full fledged depression, poor looks, and nearly no money, compared to him who had... well, everything. I understood that he had every right to feel what he did because that's how emotions work. Then again, it frustrated me. I never complained as much as him.\n \n By the time he came back, he suddenly told me we weren't friends any more. Completely out of the fucking blue. I was confused to say the least. I told him we could talk it out, or he could just act like nothing happened. And well, he chose the latter. I said, \"Fine, I guess we aren't friends any more.\" He replied with \"Fine, goodbye Amy.\" And that was the last I spoke with him on the matter.\n \n It tore me up for a long time. I had lost both Jack and Kean in such a short amount of time. I supposed at least I had Curt to talk to. He was comforting. A bit of a realist and definitely blunt, but, he said everything I needed to hear. No sugar coating, just cold reality. \n \n \"People can be like that. If he's fine with throwing you away that easily, he was never really your friend to begin with. He just wanted attention.\"\n \n A few days after, I talked to Kean about it. The first I had talked to him in probably a month. He replied with things like, \"What? Why would he do that... I have no clue...\" I explained that it happened out of nowhere. That he never told me what was wrong but it happened, and I was done with it. I was too grown up for kids games like that. And that was the last I had talked to Kean.\n \n Pat had received a message on Facebook from Jack telling him that he still wanted to be friends with him, just not me. Pat asked why, and finally I got some fucking answers. Apparently Kean had told Jack about the conversation we had had a while ago, about how I was losing faith in Jack being a good person. And just to note, this was maybe two or three months before Kean eventually told him. I just wanted reassurance. I'm not trying to justify myself but I wanted someone to tell me he was a good person. I know I should have talked to Jack about it. Then again, our friendship probably could have ended a lot sooner than it did. Jack apparently started hating me, and eventually wanted to cut all ties with me. Fine, I was done with it.\n \n That all was a month ago.\n \n Not even a week ago I had a missed phone call at 11:47 at night. My phone was on silent, so I hadn't seen it until I had rolled over and checked my phone probably ten minutes later. The number was unknown, but the area code wasn't from around where I lived. I Googled it and found it was from the state Kean lived in. Now, I had deleted both Kean and Jack's phone numbers, Skype handles, everything. Thinking logically, Kean was the only one that had my number from that state, unless it were some weird phone scam. I noticed that I had a voice mail. From my T-Mobile Visual Voicemail app, it told me that the message was three minutes long. Huh. Okay.\n \n I pressed play on the message and it was entirely silent. There was a soft noise that could be heard every second or so, a sound I recognized as sleeping. There was a time that Kean had fallen asleep on a Skype call, and he had this cute little snore that I remember fawning over. I recognized it as his. Well, he must have accidentally dialed me, I supposed. I listened to the message for about a minute, but finding nothing strange, closed the voicemail and went back to sleep. I was a little creeped out, but knew it was nothing important. I expected to get some kind of text message in the morning from him saying \"I accidentally called you last night, haha. Sorry.\"\n \n That text message never came. I figured maybe it was because we hadn't really talked for the last month, that we weren't nearly as close as we used to be so it would be strange to say that. I don't know, I was just making shit up to stop myself from thinking 'not even Kean cared about you'.\n \n Yesterday evening I got a message from an unknown Skype handle.\n \n[10:08:05 PM] ---- : Have you heard from Kean?\n\nThe only person that would message me on Skype like that would most likely be Jack. \n\n[10:08:34 PM] ---- : Did he call you? Or leave you a weird voice message?\n\nI decided I'd humor him a bit. I was still a bit resentful towards him, but it was a harmless question.\n\n[10:10:54 PM] Cinastar : Uh. Yeah, he called but it wasn't a weird voicemail. He was just sleeping. I figured it was an accident. I haven't heard from him since, figured he was busy with school.\n\n[10:11:02 PM] ---- : You didn't listen to the end of the voicemail did you?\n\n[10:11:48 PM] Cinastar : .. It was 3 minutes long why would I listen to all of that. I assume he accidentally called you too? Weird, I guess.\n\n[10:13:02 PM] ---- : Amy, that wasn't an accident.\n\nI didn't know what to say because I figured he was freaking me out on purpose, so I didn't reply.\n\n[10:15:22 PM] ---- : Something's wrong.\n\nI don't know what he means by that. I've been too busy with work today that I haven't bothered with the message. I'm pretty skeptical that it's anything important, but I'm going to listen to it eventually. It's actually scaring me a little bit. I just wanted some feedback as to what someone else thinks it is. Pat thinks it's a joke and nothing to worry about, but.. I don't know. It's kind of exciting to think it might be something, right? "},"326":{"title":"Why the cruelty of others is far more scary than the paranormal.

As I was waiting, I overheard the man behind me talking on the phone. One phrase caught my attention:\n\n\"…Yeah, I'll put the bookshelf up on Craigslist tomorrow.\"\n\nIt seems totally random, yes, but I was actually looking for a bookshelf. After he hung up, I turned around and said that I heard him mention selling a bookshelf and asked what it looked like. He described it as black, maybe six and a half feet tall and about four feet long. It sounded like what I was looking for, so I asked how much he wanted for it. He said $35, which was good enough for me. I told him that I might be interested in buying it and he mentioned that he lived nearby. We decided that I should just follow him home and take a look. \n\nThis guy was in his late forties or early fifties. He was living in a basement apartment, but I didn't think much of it. I followed him in and he pointed me to his office, where the bookshelf was. I was told to just go take a look, as he wanted to grab something to drink. He asked if I wanted anything, which I didn't. I inspected the bookshelf as I waited for him to come back and it looked good. \n\nWhen the guy came back, I got knocked over. He gagged and handcuffed me, then dragged me out of the office and into his bedroom.\n\nI've been trying all day to write a narrative of what happened next. It's just too difficult to go through it in that sort of detail, though. I think that for now, I'm just going to have to list the events and relevant facts. Sorry it's not in story form, but it's still too traumatizing to fully explain.\n\n• I was put inside an empty closet, which the man then proceeded to barricade shut.\n\n• I was left there for what seemed like a really long time, but it was probably really an hour or two.\n\n• As I was in the closet, I managed to get a bobby pin out of my hair. I learned to pick handcuffs a couple of years ago, but haven't practice in a while. I spent a fair amount of time trying to get the plasticky stuff off the ends. (Why is it that on some bobby pins, they always slide of way too easily and on others, it practically takes a razor blade to scrape them off?) \n\n• I eventually decided that even if I got the handcuffs off, it wouldn't do me much good, as he was larger and stronger than me and even if I could surprise him with not being handcuffed when he opened the closet, I probably couldn't do much more. I finished scraping off the bobby pin, bent it into the right shape and tucked it away for later use, if necessary.\n\n• When he came back, he took me out of the closet and tied me to his bed. He had a duffle bag with him. It looked like it had sat in an attic for a while. \n\n• As he was going through his duffle bag looking for something, his cell phone rang. He turned on the radio in the bedroom, answered it and closed the door behind him as he went to a different room to talk. As a result, I didn't hear what was going on. It felt like he didn't want me to hear, though.\n\n• I tried to look around the room and familiarize myself with anything I could use as an improvised weapon. The place was pretty empty, so there wasn't much. I noticed that in the laundry basket, there was a pair of jeans with a belt still on it. I saw a can of black spray paint. I was desperate for anything.\n\n• Ten minutes later (again, a best guess), he came back. \n\n• Okay, this is when it gets really difficult. It'll probably be a lot of information in a few sentences and while I wish I was able to better explain, it's just too hard.\n\n• He grabbed something out of his duffle bag. It reminded me of one of those head massager things, but more flexible and with sticky pads at the ends.\n\n• He affixed it to my head, somewhat covering my face. He said something along the lines of, \"I want you to remember one thing and one thing only: You don't mess with us. You stay away. Back off and it's better for all of us.\"\n\n• He plugged the head device into some kind of little machine and I felt these electrical currents. It wasn't quite like being shocked, but it was very uncomfortable nonetheless. They also gave me a really bad migraine.\n\n• At this point I've realized that this isn't just a random crazy - this guy is part of the network. When he finishes using the machine however, I just try to act really disoriented and like I don't know where I am. I still remembered everything (probably as a result of the chip malfunctioning), but he seemed to be satisfied that I had my memory erased.\n\n• While that seemed like a good idea at the time, in retrospect I'm not sure what the wisest thing to do would have been. \n\n• He raped me.\n\n• He hooked me up again and \"erased\" my memory.\n\n• I had to be all disoriented again.\n\n• He left me tied up in the closet again.\n\n• He later took me out and raped me again.\n\n• I think you get the drill by now. This happened for a while.\n\nI feel like at this point I'm useless at telling this story. I'm super upset. It's taken all day to do this. I can't keep going. I wish that it had worked and that I didn't remember. He was sick and terrible. I don't want to remember. I want it to stop."},"327":{"title":"Why the cruelty of others is far more scary than the paranormal.

While I stand by that this is my experience and that I am writing this account as a way of getting this information out there, not as entertainment, I would like to address those who don't believe me.\n\nWhile I have been aware all along that there would be people skeptical of my story, I chose nosleep for a reason. As an online community, you give people the benefit of the doubt long enough to hear them out. If you don't believe, you can downvote and leave. I prioritized answering comments, but last night I just gave up. I am having a hard enough time dealing with all of this to have to constantly answer to increasingly mean remarks.\n\nThe types of cruel, insensitive comments I have been getting are uncalled for. Some of the PMs are even worse. Some of you are making me feel genuinely threatened. Others are just making me feel really discouraged and more firm in my belief that the world really is a cruel place. Several of you have suggested that I am crazy. If that is the case, *why are you trying to make things worse for me?*\n\nIf you sincerely believe I'm making this up, then consider this a \"the terrorists have won\" situation: You have drastically changed the way this subreddit behaves based on one story. What made nosleep amazing was the \"everything is true\" mentality. That just got shattered.\n\nIf I was making potentially libelous statements against a specific individual or organization, I could see this type of behavior being more justified. But I have not. I have not said, \"Here is this person – harass him because he did bad things.\" Your behavior is seriously unwarranted.\n\nA specific set of comments I would like to address are the ones about how I \"didn't tell the police.\" If you are marketing yourselves as psychics, change professions. Where I left off last night, I was still being held hostage. Calling the police was not even an option yet. Even worse than giving me flack for what I did do is being overly critical of something that didn't even happen. \n\nAdditionally, I feel that the type of victim blaming that accuses me of enabling future rapes by not reporting is especially insensitive. Most rapes are not reported and you are not just hurting me, but any other victim of rape that have chosen to not involve the police. It's a very personal decision and the aftermath of rape is grueling enough without a bunch of uninvolved parties intruding on you and questioning your story to no end.\n\nIn contrast,  there have been several of you that have been extremely kind and supportive. I have gotten many responses of people willing to hold my file and I've emailed it to two of you. I trust these people to deny having it, so don't expect it to show up. To clarify, they will only be able to open the file and distribute it if I am reported missing or dead. A report needs to be made in order for the file holders to access the data. You'll never figure it out otherwise.\n\nSo thank you to those of you who have been kind to me. Because of you, here comes the last part.\n\nBut first, **here is the end you should read if you don't believe me:**\n\n*I woke up and it was all one big, terrible nightmare.*\n\nGo complain about that now.\n\nFor the rest of you, here's what really happened.\n\nThis went on throughout the night. I don't think it's necessary to go into too much detail. But whether or not I was being raped, I was hooked up to the device at least once every two hours.\n\nAt around 4:00 a.m., he took me out to my car. He had my keys, so he drove us to a church parking lot the next town over. He made a phone call simply consisting of, \"I'm ready,\" then started hooking me up to the device one last time. We wait for a few minutes, then another car pulls up. A man in a ski mask gets out and together they move me over to the driver's seat. As the first man uses the device to presumably remove my memory, the other removes my handcuffs and the gag. Then the device is swiftly detached and they hurry to the other car.\n\nPresumably, I'm waking up in a church parking lot with no memory of the last thirteen hours or so. I sat there for about ten minutes, just in shock. I knew that if I had been found and taken, the others in the group could have it happen to them, too – with possibly worse consequences. This was enough motivation for me to report the incident. While it might not stop every member of the network, having one or two of them behind bars would at least be a start and maybe serve as a warning.\n\nI needed some time to figure out what to tell the police, so I started by driving to the nearest hospital. I went in, explained that I had just been raped and they started their standard procedures. They checked me medically, performed a rape kit and asked what I wanted to do as far as police involvement. I told them that I was fine with them contacting the police and by the time they finished gathering evidence and taking care of me, an officer had arrived.\n\nI had to tell him the truth to a certain degree, but I didn't feel like going into the microchip stuff was productive at this point. The story was that I was buying this guy's bookshelf, but that he then held me hostage and repeatedly raped me. As for how I got out, I said that at some point I had passed out or fallen asleep from exhaustion and that I had woken up in my car at the church parking lot. \n\nBecause I had a description of the guy, knew where he (presumably) lived, had gotten the police involved early and was stating some pretty serious accusations, the officer got a detective involved immediately. I was taken over to the police station and they took my car to search for evidence.\n\nI spent the morning and afternoon in interview after interview. Based on the marks on my arms from the handcuffs, the initial assessment of the sexual assault nurse examiner and the evidence she found, having information on where the guy might be, and me staying consistent in my story, they were ready to act. They told me that they were going to go talk to him, probably arrest him and call me that evening. My victim's advocate got me a prepaid phone to use until I could get a new cell phone (the man had taken my old one and presumably destroyed it) and arranged for a rental car while they examined mine.\n\nI came home exhausted and completely drained. I needed to sleep, but was terrified. I locked myself in, then barricaded the door to my bedroom. I secured the window, too, as best I could. I put some clothes under my blankets to make it look like someone was there and went to sleep under the bed, clutching the prepaid phone.\n\nFive hours later, I woke up startled and hit my head pretty hard trying to get up. The cell phone was emitting the most awful ringing noise I have ever heard. I answered it and the sergeant over the case told me that they had tracked down a man matching the description I gave at the location I had given them. It seemed almost too good to be true. They had brought him in for questioning, they said, and searched his apartment.\n\nMy heart was pounding. I felt like I was going to throw up. But what he said next just made me go completely numb.\n\n\"Based on the conversations we had with this man and our initial assessment of the information you gave us, it does not appear that there is a strong case going forward. We will still submit a report, but honestly, we cannot take him into custody and I doubt that charges will be pursued.\"\n\nI don't know what he said or did that made them go from being ready to get the bad guy to basically dropping the whole thing. Once I was over the initial shock, I tried to get more information. What had changed in those five hours? I tried involving my victim's advocate. While initially supportive of me, she didn't make any progress and now takes several days to return any calls. I got a local legal clinic to look into it and they came back saying that while it seemed strange, they couldn't find any signs that the police were in the wrong.\n\nThat's where it's at now. I've been moving around as much as I can in order to keep this guy from finding me again. Turning him in was a risky move and since he is still free, I'm worried about revenge. I am not planning on updating this story any more and am about to move again.\n\nIn summary, this is my best guess about what's going on:\n\nEither the U.S. government or a medical organization was working on brain implant technology. Someone with access to that research – probably even someone on the team – took that information and reworked the technology on his own time. The result was a microchip that, when properly stimulated, would store the memory of what just happened on the chip instead of in the mind.\n\nA (probably) small network of people had access to these chips and they primarily used them to hide acts of abuse. \n\nEventually, the chips malfunctioned and the memories that had been redirected to the chip now replayed with alarming regularity. The chips are placed in the brain in such a way that removing them surgically is highly dangerous. We have yet to test any other way of disabling them, as it seems to be high risk.\n\nSomeone connected to the network found me, held me hostage, raped me and assumed the chip was still working. I personally suspect that he did it outside of consent from the network. But having found that my chip wasn't working properly, it seems like he would have notified the network. That makes me think that others are now looking for me and the group, too. \n\nWhether they're going to kill us, implant an improved chip or do something else, I do not know. Sometimes I feel like the only way to be taken seriously is to off myself so that the police and everyone else know that I no longer have anything to gain. \n\nThey network has probably read this by now.

Part 6 should be up tonigh.*\n\nOkay, everyone, I know you were hoping for part 6, but you're gonna have to wait a few more hours. I'm really sorry about that. I've been gradually trying to put it together, but I keep having panic attacks and it's just freaking me out to even think about what happened. It's still really recent and I'm still trying to even understand it. I think that ultimately, it's good for me to write it out, but it's really hard.\n\nSo, for now, I'm just checking in to let you know I'm still alive, not captured by the network and going to be answering comments for a bit to get a break of sorts from thinking about the most recent events. Besides, I feel strongly that all of you deserve replies, as you've stuck with me through this. \n\nBut the reason I'm making this post is also to ask for a favor.\n\nIn the comments, it was pointed out that I should get send the information to a few of my fellow Redditors in case something happens. I think that's a good idea. So what I'm asking is for people to volunteer to hold onto a file of information on me alone, as I don't want to infringe on the privacy of my group members. I will set it up with a password, along with instructions on how to obtain the password should I disappear (and how to know if I'm truly gone). \n\nIf you volunteer, you need to agree to not try to open the file unless it's absolutely necessary. You will also need to promise to keep it secret, obviously. Also, I'd recommend not trying to find this group on your own. I don't know how much help law enforcement will be, so I need someone with good judgment. I'll probably pick two or three people. If you're interested, PM me with an email address I can send the file to, as well as why you think you're a good choice. \n\nIn addition, I contacted my group with the suggestion that we should set up a system where if not a single one of us log on to our communication base for a week, all the data we've accumulated should be released to, well, I'm not quite sure what the best option is, but we'll figure it out. This is the sort of thing that every group member would have to agree on, so I don't think that we'll know today or maybe even this week. I'm pretty sure the tech guy is out of town and he's the one who would know how to set it up anyway. We also carefully discuss things to look at all possible options, but the suggestion is out there and I hope it takes.\n\nOne more thing: I mentioned part of this in the comments, but I doubt everyone saw it. If you think that this could have happened to you, too, only consider this as a last resort. Most of the time when we find someone who sounds like they're one of us, it's not the case. Over the last few years, we've only found nine of us – with two of them being sisters. There is one major symptom that all of us have in common that I have NOT listed so that we can still tell who really is one of us. If you sincerely believe this story fits your reality, please feel free to PM me. Just make sure to include the last symptom. If you're one of us, you'll know what it is. If not, you probably don't have to worry about the network. I do, however, wish you the best in your recovery.\n\nThanks for all the support I've gotten. I'm sorry that some of you are frustrated about slow updates, but I would like to point out that I'm going much faster than most serials I've read on here and it's kind of a necessity based on my situation. I'm trying my best to get through part 6, but it's really, really painful."},"329":{"title":"walls dripping in pure blackness","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/m3s7w\/walls_dripping_in_pure_blackness\/","flair":null,"author":"0obeno0","selftext":"I was lying in a sort of basement underground room, in a random guest house last night, during my traveling around in Europe.

The email goes as follows:\n\n*Hey (Name Disclosed), I am getting a bit weirded out by something I found on a video camera, wanna come over and check it out?

He is my best friend.\n\nHe is quite good with Videos and stuff, (he's been pretty much addicted to youtube since he was about 8,), and he offered the look more closely at the videos and pictures, see if he can find anything, and with that, he left me for a week.\n\nDuring that week, I texted him, I messaged him, I emailed him, nothing, nothing came back.

I was scared. I decided I would stop searching for stuff. Stop right away, as it only made more trouble for the other guy when he went looking for it. So I stopped, I told Alex to stop, he was reluctant, but he agreed and that was it.\n\nUntil Two Weeks Later.\n\nAlex called me out of the blue, he hadn't stopped and started saying that he had told some of his friends about the videos and that he had put them on youtube.\nI had a massive go at him, told him he just needed to tell the police and leave it.

I’d like to say it was a joyous occasion. But I can’t, in all good faith, say that without being a dirty lowdown prevaricator. That’s somebody who lies like the rug. Very dirty, dirty rug at that.\n\nThings have been pretty rough the last 10 years. I think it’s mostly because I’m easy to manipulate. At least that’s what I think my therapist has been implying. \n\nDid your mom tell you you better shop around?Because mine didn’t.\n\nHow rough were things in my marriage you ask? \n\nSo rough that by the end of our second year together Janice was taking multiple prescriptions to control her bipolar, narcissistic thing, anxiety, depression and drinking problem.\n\nGoddamn medicine chest look like Walgreens.\n\nIt was no small victory getting Janice to the psychiatrist.\n\n“Are you saying I’m not drop dead gorgeous and that men aren’t always showing interest?”\n\nIt was like a root canal but once the shrink saw what we were dealing with, out came the script pad. And therapy, lotsa that.\n\nWe had our ups and downs but I guess I never thought I was in Janice’s class. Me and my therapist were addressing that issue for the last eight years but after last night, I just don’t know.\n\nLast night, Janice, who does what she likes to call dating around, which is essentially doing God knows what with whichever of her myriad friends that she’s always collecting like toys in the attic, last night she comes home about 9pm smelling like a distillery and;\n\nA. Kisses me right on the mouth.\n\nB. Puts her hand behind her back and with a mischievous grin says;\n\nC. Pick.\n\nso I pick and she opens her hand with a theatrical flourish and that mischievous evil grin again pops in,  and she says, “take one.”\n\nJanice had two pills, one blue and one red.\n\nI got the red one. She placed it in my hand.\n\nI asked her what was it.\n\n“It’s like ecstasy but times 700,000,000.“\n\n“That doesn’t sound very good I say.”\n\n“Lindsay, this marriage just isn’t working. All I think about is porn and cheating on you any damn time I feel like it with a belly full of vodka at that\n\nBut my girlfriend got a hold of these pills through her new shrink and she said it patched up her and her husband after ferocious domestic abuse and now they’re like two peas in a pot and they don’t even eat therapy anymore.“\n\n“I don’t know.“\n\nAnd and here’s the rub. Although my mother tried her damnedest to raise a fool she failed. So, that when I was confronted with the pharmaceutical challenge on my 10th wedding anniversary. I knew what to do.\n\n“You wanna drink,“ I asked.\n\n“Do you have mommy issues?\n\nCould be pretty snarky when she wanted to specially when she was sober or just getting her buzz on. Yeah that anti-alcohol medication that shit don’t work\n\nSo while I was fixing drinks, I put the red pill in the cabinet in a napkin, and I took a multivitamin and then I poured two tumblers full of vodka.\n\nI handed her the drink, kissed her hard on the mouth and said bottoms up\n\nJanice took the pill and washed it down with about 2 ounces of vodka without flinching.\n\n“Now it’s your turn”\n\nI obliged. Janice knotted and drank another 3 ounces of vodka.\n\nI took a small sip for my part. I really much preferred the weed pen, but I never told Janice or my therapist about it because there’s something so odd sometimes and the way my therapist Steve acts when Janice is nearby. I could almost feel they are in cahoots at our couples therapy.\n\nJanice told me to come close she said tonight is the night that is all about new beginnings and the kiss held and it metamorphic into a lot of things and I hadn’t done in years but before it was over, caught up in the rapture, I went to kiss Janice’s neck and that’s when I felt it.\n\nScales I’m talking serpentine scales right under her jaw that weren’t there before we got into bed kissing while she was Trippin and she kept saying “this is not your father‘s Cadillac.”\n\nMy face felt it first but within a few minutes when we were disrobed, that’s when I realized it was almost like the literal autistic translation of death by 1000 paper cuts. All over my body.\n\nAs Janice asserted her dominance, the pain worsened. Now it wasn’t just my face anymore. It’s my arms, my legs, my stomach, my feet. Like being attacked by the sandpaper people.\n\nJanice began hissing and clawing, and the whole thing to send it into the simple fact that her skin was covered in scaly eruptions. Her eyes were almost yellow. She was definitely drooling, and I could not get her off me.\n\n“It’s ssssssso much better like thissssss.”\n\nTwo truths and no lie.\n\nTruth number one is I passed out from fright.\n\nTruth number two is I don’t think Janice noticed because when I woke up this morning, I had no problems I could not even dream.\n\nJanice was gone. The apartment was ransacked and I have a little red marks and welts that were bloody all over my body.\n\n“Went to get more candy. You better be home when I get back loverboy.”\n\nI scratched my bald head, trying to figure out this agreed to puzzle.\n\nSomething fell to my bare feet. I scratch some more\n\nMore stuff falls to the floor and it looks like scales. I run to the bathroom mirror and I say, “Thisssss suckssssss,” with a literally forked tongue.\n\nAccording to my reflection, I seem to be turning into some type of snake like reptile. And Janice is always good about coming back to cause more trouble so I only got a couple hours now I don’t know what kind of condition I’m gonna be in a couple of hours\n\n\n\nAnybody ever come across anything like this before big fat pill too little polkadots oh shit I still got one in the drawer. The one I didn’t take I don’t know what the fuck I’m gonna do. Let me go slither away and I can find a scientist and that’s when I had the desire to eat a rodent. \n\nI don’t want to eat rats.

If, on the other hand, you are upset about what I wrote or are interested in the discussion about the appropriateness of the story for this subreddit, feel free to read on.*\n\nTwo days ago, I started posting a serialized story here on r\/nosleep. While it started out being hailed as \"a breath of fresh air\" and \"compelling,\" I have since then been accused of ruining the subreddit, enabling rape and generally being a terrible person. On the other hand, I've had people who have shown me amazing kindness, especially in private messages. The help and information some of you have offered has been overwhelming.\n\nNeedless to say, I think I've inadvertently made myself one of the most controversial authors on r\/nosleep.\n\nLast night I decided to remove myself from the comments and even almost all of the PMs. I was hoping to just finish the story, let the voting system take care of it and move on. But after criticism of my story moved from the comments and started coming into their own, I had a PM talk with one of my biggest critics and came to the conclusion that it would be appropriate for me to address a few things regarding the story and my intent. Also, having been on the receiving end of an unusual amount of debunking and criticism (for r\/nosleep), I'm throwing in my two cents on that as well.\n\n**How I started writing this story**\n\nA few days ago, after seeing a movie with a lot of potential that ended up being about aliens (again), I got caught up in a conversation about what is actually \"scary.\" I was of the opinion that monsters, aliens, ghosts, etc. have become somewhat of a crutch in terms of scary stories. My discussion partner, however, had the attitude of, \"Well, what else could we do?\" I defended the position that reality is the scariest thing out there, especially the things that people do to each other. I was challenged to prove my point and the next day, I posted the first part of the story. (Making a movie was clearly too time consuming and expensive.)\n\n**Concerning whether or not it is true**\n\nIn order to complete my goal, I went straight to what scares me the most in real life. I am perfectly fine with whether or not people believe that microchips planted by a secret network is to blame for my symptoms. What I want to make 100 percent clear is that outside of the \"Is it true or not?\" discussion, a few things need to be accepted as fact.\n\nBetween the ages of 4 and 11, I was repeatedly sexually abused by my mom's friend's husband. \n\nLast month, I was stuck in a basement apartment with an older man who raped me.\n\nWhen I tried telling the police about the rape, they were initially super supportive and actually said they were planning on arresting him. This was, in part, due to a recorded verbal confession of rape from this man. Despite this, my case apparently doesn't \"hold up\" and I am stuck in a very confusing place from both a legal and emotional place. \n\nBattle out the conspiracy theories all you want, but I will stand by these three things no matter what. \n\n**About sexual abuse and rape**\n\nSome people complained that my use of rape in the plot was distasteful. This mostly seemed to be people who were adamant about my story not being true. \n\nI would like to point out that whether or not you believe in the story as a whole, part of my intent in writing the story was to convey three things: the sheer terror of having to relive the worst moments of your life repeatedly and realistically; the constant fear of never being safe and having this proven true again and again; and, finally, the despair of being stuck in a reality where those who are supposed to protect you fail to do so and even make it worse.\n\nAside from the truthfulness of the narrative, those are things that I have to feel on a daily basis. I wanted to show that these things are, at least to me, far more terrifying than anything I have ever seen in a scary movie (and I have seen very many). \n\nNext time you are sitting in a classroom, movie theatre or religious service, count off every third female and every fifth male. Statistically, those people were or will be sexually abused or assaulted by age 18. It's very sobering to think about how prevalent of a problem this is. Sometimes, the result of this abuse is more severe than others. In cases like mine, it's sometimes debilitating – whether as a result of a microchip or post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nI hope you can understand that in this story, it was not simply a \"plot tool.\" I was trying to convey the lasting terror that those things can cause. In my experience, it's one of the scariest things out there.\n\n**Was this the right subreddit for this story?**\n\nHonestly? I don't know for sure. With the byline of \"A subreddit where fear itself dwells,\" it seemed appropriate. If the mission is to tell stories that impose fear in an atmosphere where everything is real (even when it's not), it seems like a fair submission. If anyone looking for strictly paranormal stories, the title of my posts should have been fair warning. I was inclined to post here for a reason and I still think I was within the current guidelines. If the readers of this subreddit decide that they want to eliminate stories that do not have a paranormal aspect, it's something that should be taken up with the mods.\n\n**My thoughts on the civility in discussion**\n\nI see two of the major draws of r\/nosleep as being that everything is true and that debunking is strongly discouraged. My story attracted a lot of attention and as the plot thickened, those two aspects basically fell apart. Instead of opinions on the story itself, questions about what was going on, contributions of relevant information or other generally appropriate feedback, it all fell apart. \n\nWhat started as criticisms of my choice to post in parts turned into critiques of the way I was writing, along with people trying to prove that what I was saying was either implausible or simply untrue. This really broke the mood that r\/nosleep is known for and while I tried to offer explanations at first, it just stopped being worth it. \n\nBy the time part 6 was up, the personal attacks were getting more and more severe. People were making assumptions about where the story was going and bashing me based on those, going so far as to accuse me and other rape victims of being rape enablers. Personally, I think victim blaming is rarely (if ever) an appropriate thing to do, as it creates an environment that allows for continued violence. Part of the reason why victims don't always speak up is due to these types of responses. Only when people stop assuming they know everything and give crime victims the same benefit of the doubt that criminals are legally afforded can we even begin to address the personal and societal pestilence that sexual assault is.\n\nI think that this story and the ensuing discussion serve as a reflection of what r\/nosleep is potentially becoming. There's still time to stop it. Is this really what you want the community to be like? The whole reason I love Reddit is because you can upvote and downvote. Nosleep is unique because it relies on that system more than other subreddits, as they discourage questioning the author. Do you, as a community, want to keep this environment intact? If so, I suggest that you take a long hard look at what just happened.\n\nI know not everyone likes every story. That's okay. Just remember that Reddit isn't 4chan and r\/nosleep isn't Reddit. We have a very special community – let's keep it that way.

What people can feel, see, touch, hear, and smell is painfully limited, so 90% of the Earth's natural actions will never come to our attention. An example of our body's ignorance is the electromagnetic spectrum (both visible and invisible light), which anyone with even a brief history of science knows humans are mostly blind to. In short, there are constantly invisible events and beings around us that we will never know about. \n\nIncluded in these invisible beings are insects known as \"Spider T974s\" because they haven't been truly named by science. These spiders are barely poisonous, and only have venom strong enough to get you mildly sick. Ever heard of rhinovirus? *The common cold?* Sure you have, but most people sick with rhino virus have never even been near a rhino...\n\nSuch a funny coincidence... Spider T974s are supposed to look like horned black-widows, giving them a *rhino* appearance; it's only appropriate if I refer to the spiders as, \"Rhino Spiders,\" for the rest of this post. \n\nYou must be asking yourself, \"Well, why can't I see them?\" As stated earlier, a rhino spider exoskeleton mixes with light so precisely that the light's sensitivity is changed, pushing it out of the visible spectrum. Rhino spiders are very sensitive and try to move away from even the smallest change in the environment. \n\nLet's say, you're looking at a picture of a spider, and your hair *just barely* stands up. To the rhino spiders, that small change is quite startling, and sends them running down your arms or legs. There's nothing you can do about, because as recently discovered, there are A LOT of them. \n\nNatural predators can't see them either, so their numbers grow and grow and grow until every where you go is covered with them. I don't mean to frighten you, but chances are that your home, cars, and workplaces have rhino spider infestations.\n\nMaybe more difficult to come to terms with is their size. Sure, most of them are relatively small, but failure of crowd control by nature's natural hunters has caused some rhino spiders to grow incredibly big; some are believed to be as large as small children. \n\nThink about it, have you ever laid in your bed at night and heard scratches from outside? *\"Oh, it's just the trees...\"* The trees are always scratching against your house, but somehow *that's* the only time you hear it?

It is aimed at YOU. You know who you are, and I wish for you that every thing your loathsome selves enjoy be done upon your person a thousand times over!\n\nWith that out of the way, allow me to commence.\n\nGreetings, ladies and gentlemen. As you can see, my name is Daniel, I'll withhold my surnames, as I would like to retain a sliver of that illusion called \"privacy.\" I am writing this under a crushing amount of psychological stress, and enjoying the placid stupor of my prescription drug -an anxiolytic, to regulate high levels of anxiety,- yet I assure you, I am as lucid as I have ever and will ever be. I wish I could forget what I am about to narrate, yet there's no nepenthe that could erase the things I have seen, what I know. I shall relate my experiences as a naive explorer of the \"Deep Web\" to the best of my ability.\n\nTo commence, I would like to give you insight as to what is this \"Deep Web.\" Imagine an iceberg, the most massive pile of buoyant ice you can conjure. That is the Internet. As you know by the ages old adage, the tip of the iceberg is the portion we can easily see; in this context, the \"Upper Web\" is what we can see on our daily lives: Google, Facebook, YouTube, YouPorn, this very Reddit we are on right now. As Mufasa would put it, \"Everything the light touches,\" our kingdom of information and socialization. \"But what about that shadowy place?\" asks a young Simba. The bottom of the iceberg, that which remains unseen is the \"Deep Web,\" and in a manner akin to an actual iceberg, it comprises up to an esteemed 96% of the whole expanse of the Internet. This Deep Web contains the websites not indexed by search engines such as Google or Yahoo, not even Bing, and as such, they remain hidden beneath the \"water.\" And just as Mufasa replied, \"That is beyond our borders, you must never go there.\" And what did Simba do? The very same stupid, foolish, unforgivable thing I did. He disregarded the warnings.\n\nI heard about the Deep Web from an acquaintance of mine, a fellow who studies computer engineering and, as such, has contact with codes and networks and other such amenities. At first I disregarded his claims about the existence of this Deep Web, and how could I not? 'Impossible,' methought, 'that such a vast repository of information and interaction could lie hidden beneath our noses. Ludicrous!' -And, for the record yes, this is the way I think and speak in English, as it is not my mother language. They know, and so do you have the right to know- At the time it appeared to me as a thing of legend, a vast reservoir of knowledge and arcane lore the likes of which could be found in lost Alexandria, or the ransacked libraries of Baghdad. The mere idea that such an inconceivable ocean of data -an esteemed 8 flaming petabytes! existed in our world seemed beyond fantastic. Like a fool I was seduced by the idea of seeing this occult side of the Internet.\n\nSwayed and tutored by my acquaintance in the ways to access the Deep Web, -ways that for your safety I shall not, and I repeat, shall NOT describe, so please don't inquire about them- feeling safe and sound within the sanctum of my living quarters, I clicked on the executable program that would link me with this gallery of knowledge. Admittedly, at the time I felt like the One after having chosen the red pill, about to embark in a journey through untrodden pathways of information; I felt akin to an explorer akin to Columbus, a scientist on par with Darwin as he voyaged across the Galapagos islands in the search for wisdom. Perhaps if my mind had been made of sterner stuff I could have withstood what I came to learn.\n\nAnd so I entered into the realm beyond the light. \n\nAt first it was a grossly underwhelming, anticlimactic sight to behold. \"The fuck is this?\" I intoned, as I was greeted by a blank page stating I had entered correctly. Was this the oh so famous \"deep web?\" A blank page with less flair than the 90's gif-fests of yore? I found myself feeling an abject disappointment; my thoughts of unknown secrets, adventure, and discovery had toppled to the ground. Now I wish I had left them there, never to be picked up. \n\nMy acquaintance sent me a link, eloquently titled the \"hidden wiki.\" Within, I found a list of links categorized in a wide arrange of topics: You could find links to purchase weapons and drugs in the black market, to arrange shady meetings, and of course, porn -much like life in the universe, in the Internet, porn always finds a way.- Suffice to say my appetite had been whetted, and I hungered, lusted, for more. \n\nAnd here is where I must needs take a break, another dose of alprazolam as this one has worn out. Let me tell you my diagnosis, so you can better understand my... condition, and to calm myself down a trifle; if you feel like it feel free to skip the following couple paragraphs entirely as they pertain to my personality and not to the story itself.\n\nAfter being entered in my local psychiatric hospital, which I'm afraid is nothing like what you see in movies, and being medicated, I was diagnosed with \"Unspecified Anxiety Disorder,\" 300.00 as cataloged on the DSM-V and F41.9 on the CIE-10 manual, and \"Paranoid Personality Disorder,\" 301.0 (F60.0) What this signifies is that I suffer from crippling anxiety attacks on a near-daily basis; I commence sweating profusely, breathe heavily, and more often than not I'm prone to attacking other people, hence part of the \"justification\" for a paranoid personality diagnosis. The idiots; what they did was, in truth, say that they knew I was anxious but possessed no idea as to what was the cause. That's what happens when every flaming psychiatrist suffers from an acute case of fecal encephalopathy. So, they medicated me, with the medicine that grants them a share of course, and called it a day. Of course they also hinted to my parents that I \"may\" be a risk for developing paranoid schizophrenia, since I'm within the age range. Twenty years as of the time of this writing, twenty one in a few weeks; they know and so you have right to know.\n\nIn truth, I do not have much to complain about regarding my medication, as it has proven to be respite. Respite and nepenthe from the memory of the lore. I quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this forbidden lore! Quoth the raven, 'Nevermore.' \n\nAmusing how anxiety enhances your metabolism, makes things seemingly act quicker, but wear out faster. At least I need not worry about being obese. \n\nBut back to the story.\n\nAs I was relating, I ventured forth into the Deep Web in the search for hidden gems of knowledge. And I did learn a lot: There's a huge, expansive black market for weapons, drugs, explosives and any illegal thing you may imagine; exotic creatures abound and are sold at quite reasonable prices -if you consider $10,000.99 reasonable for a Siberian tiger that is;- counterfeit money was sold on a rate of 2:1, and PayPal accounts containing up to $100,000.00 sold for a fraction of their purported value. It appeared to me as a veritable \"Rosebud\" cheat, only in real life. 'Fantastic!' methought, \"ALLONS-Y!\" quoth I.\n\nOf course, inquisition and discovery, a lapse is necessary. And what better way to regain energy and confidence, than to ogle some fine pornography? What can I say, I am but a man. Intrigued by the... possibilities of what I could find, I ventured into the \"Erotica\" section of the hidden wiki. What first stood out to me was a link titled \"Pink Meth,\" a quaint name, but seemingly fitting for the purpose, thought I. At first sight it seemed to be your standard porn site, pictures of girls neatly arranged in rows, without a specific order to them; some of then scantly clad, others perfectly naked. Nothing unusual up to this point, merely another page that offered \"amateur porn.\" But then I noticed a curious link beneath each picture, the name of the lady in question and, attached to it, a FaceBook profile. \"The hell!?\" exclaimed I as the blue letters took me to a FaceBook page; her name, address, friends, family, IP, everything had been laid out before me. \n\nThis admittedly distressed me. The information I had access to could positively ruin a young lady's life. Not only that, it could be used for... other purposes. Suddenly the jokes about how \"stalking is much easier thanks to FaceBook\" took a much sinister meaning. In fairness, she should not have published those pictures of herself on the internet; countering that argument however, maybe she did not, perhaps it was a spiteful boyfriend or someone hacked her PC or something of such nature. I knew not, and it was not something I wished to know the reason for.\n\nI left the site feeling a trifle shaken. \"Poor girl\" said I, and I meant it: No one should be subject to that, let alone that exposed in her personal information. I know that subreddits such as \/gonewild or \/grool serve the purpose of exposing oneself, \"going wild.\" Still, it is one thing to do it willingly and deciding what information to share into the world, and a very different situation altogether to have your identity hung out before the eyes of anyone with enough time and know-how to find it.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nAnd a good thing that I do, at that. As I write this, I realize I have nearly reached the maximum amount of allowed characters; in a way I apologize, but it is necessary, for I wish to leave no detail behind. I shall continue with the narrative in the comments section below. I do not wish to cease narrating now, as I don't know if I'll have the guts, or the soundness of mind, to keep going tomorrow in a \"part 2.\"\n\nBut I warn you: From this point on, things may become... terrible.

I didn't know where I was going, but I knew I had to get away.  \n  \nBehind me, I could hear the sound of footsteps. The dopplegangers were still after me.  \n  \nI ran faster, my lungs burning. I couldn't let them catch me. I had to survive.  \nIn the suffocating darkness of my room, I huddled beneath the bed, my heart pounding like a drum against my ribs. The air was thick with the stench of decay and fear, a testament to the horrors that had unfolded within these walls.  \n  \nMy mother's diary lay open on the floor, its pages stained with blood and tears. I had been reading it, desperate for any shred of solace or understanding, but it only served to fuel my terror. Her entries were a chilling chronicle of her descent into madness, as she became convinced that her own reflection was trying to kill her.  \n  \n'They're not me,' she had written in a trembling hand. 'They're monsters, wearing my face.'  \n  \nI had dismissed her words as the ramblings of a frightened woman, but now I knew the truth. The dopplegangers were real, and they had killed her.  \n  \nI had been hiding from them for hours, ever since I heard their footsteps echoing through the house. They were relentless, their movements fluid and predatory. I could hear them searching for me, their voices a chorus of mocking whispers.  \n  \n'Where are you, little boy?'  \n  \n'Come out, come out, wherever you are.'  \n  \nI pressed myself against the cold, damp floor, willing myself to become invisible. But they were too close, their heavy breathing just outside the door.  \n  \nSuddenly, the door creaked open, and a pair of eyes peered into the room. They were my own eyes, but they were cold and lifeless, filled with a malevolence that chilled me to the bone.  \n  \n'I found you,' the doppelganger hissed.  \n  \nI scrambled to my feet, but it was too late. The doppelganger lunged, its sharp claws extended. I dodged its attack, but it was relentless, its movements faster and more precise than my own.  \n  \nWe grappled on the floor, a blur of limbs and shadows. I fought back with all my might, but it was no use. The doppelganger was stronger, its grip like a vise.  \n  \nJust when I thought all hope was lost, I remembered the diary. I grabbed it and hurled it at the doppelganger. It hit it square in the face, and for a moment, it staggered.  \n  \nI seized the opportunity and kicked it away, sending it crashing into the wall. It lay there motionless, its eyes glazed and empty.  \n  \nI had defeated one of them, but I knew there were more. I had to find a way to escape.  \n  \nI searched the room frantically, my eyes darting from one object to the next. Finally, I spotted a small window in the corner. It was boarded up, but I could see a crack in the wood.  \n  \nWith trembling hands, I pried the boards loose and squeezed through the narrow opening.

But I smelled something rotten. \nAnd through the window everything was covered with bl00d. \nBut also green and yellow color was there too. \n\nAnd then I saw the back door it was open. \nIt’s weird how can this happen my friend was laying on her bed just before I was going to the doctor.

So, when I noticed a new app, named \"Twelve\" on my phone one dreary morning, my initial thought was a forgotten download from a sleep-deprived night. The app's icon was unassuming: a black clock, its hands eternally pointing to midnight.\n\nTapping it out of sheer curiosity, I was met with an abyss of blackness. A single, chilling line of text surfaced: *\"You are now bound. Await the twelfth hour.\"* I tried laughing it off, dismissing it as a silly game or perhaps the result of a friend's prank. But the app defied deletion, resisting all attempts.\n\nThe true oddity began that night. At the stroke of midnight, my phone vibrated with an intensity I'd never felt before. The app had a message for me: *\"Look behind you.\"* Hesitantly, I did, and my TV—previously off—sprang to life. It played grainy, distorted images: my childhood home, my first school, places I hadn’t thought about in years.\n\nEvery subsequent night brought a new instruction. Some were innocuous, like *\"Whisper your favorite memory.\"* Others were unsettling: *\"Sing your deepest secret out loud.\"* When I refused, every device in my home blared my confessions on repeat until, in sheer desperation, I relented.\n\nAs days turned into nights and nights back into days, a pattern emerged. With every passing command, the tasks grew more menacing. \n\n*\"Place a candle by your window and do not sleep.\"* Doing as instructed, I spent the night watching figures cloaked in darkness gather outside my window. They never entered, never moved closer. They just stood, their attention unwaveringly fixed on the candle's flame.\n\nHowever, one message made my blood run cold: *\"Do not turn around, no matter what you hear.\"* The night that followed was torturous. Soft, mournful whispers encircled me, voices from my past urging, pleading, demanding that I look. But fear kept me anchored, my gaze forward.\n\nThe climax of my torment was a message I hadn’t expected: *\"Say goodbye.\"* Panic took over. I barricaded myself in my bedroom. The night was an endless cacophony of knocks and voices. Each voice was unmistakably familiar: my long-deceased grandmother, a childhood friend I hadn't spoken to in decades, even my mother from just across the hall. They beckoned, cajoled, and sometimes angrily demanded I open the door. But dawn came, and the noise ceased.\n\nThe next morning, as I looked at my reflection, a horrifying realization dawned. I was younger. Not by a lot, but noticeably. The app's once static clock icon now moved, but counter-clockwise. As days turned into nights, my reflection revealed a steadily regressing version of me. My recent memories began to fade, replaced by recollections of my younger years.\n\nNow, the app's twisted commands dictate my life. They bind me to a cycle of terror, anticipation, and relentless regression. Desperate to break free, I've sought help, but to no avail. Everyone perceives me as the age I appear, with no recollection of the years I've lived.\n\nWith every midnight that the clock approaches, I inch closer to my birth. And as I pen this, I can't help but wonder: when the clock reaches the moment of my birth, will I simply cease to exist or will I be trapped in a loop of horrors I've already endured?"},"343":{"title":"2:47","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/2ib2dv\/247\/","flair":null,"author":"None","selftext":"It was a dark warm night in Wyoming, my wife Lauren was asleep, and I had tucked my two children Carly and Stan into bed.

I was sipping away at my glass when I heard a weird noise outside, sounded like a metal crowbar falling to the ground.\n \n\n I got up to make sure no one was breaking into any vehicles.  It was dark out side so I flipped on my porch light.  I still couldent see anything so i reached into my pocket for my lighter.  As I walked down my driveway which was empty because my car was in my garage, I looked at my neighbors car and it looked like a note was on the front windshield. I picked it up and read it.\n\n\n  “I will be watching you david” shocked me that my own name was on this note.  I walked over to my neighbors door.  I checked my phone and it was 2:37 In the morning I could see the light on and hear voices so I went ahead and knocked on the door.  My neighbor Dan had opened the door and asked what i needed this late.\n  I asked him if he knew anything about the note and handed it to him, he looked at it and said “FUCK!

Confused what just happened I apologized for the inconvenience and headed back inside.\n\n\n  I sat back down with my rum.  I thought to myself I have had to much to drink. I went to turn the tv off and proceeded to pour my rum out and hop in bed.  I woke up and walked down the stairs and found the tv was still on and my glass of rum still sitting on the coffee table. \n\n I looked outside and it was still dark outside, I pulled out my phone and checked the time and it was still 2:37 in the morning.  That’s when I heard a knock on the door.  I walked over to it and opened it.

My arms hurt and my neck hurt from the cops elbow in my neck but I was able to glance over and saw blood all over the place and a bloody crow bar laying on the coffee table.  As they lifted me up off the ground I looked at my shirt and there was blood everywhere.  The officer told me I was under arrest for the murder of Dan my neighbor and read me my rights before hauling me off to their police car.\n  I sat there and watched as the police stood there talking to my wife, I looked over and Dans house and it was covered in crime scene tape and police everywhere.  I sat there confused I had no idea what happened.  I was then taken and booked into the station.  I asked the guard if I could have my phone call so I could call my wife, he proceeded to tell me I could not.\n\n\n  I turned around and there were three other men in the cell with me, one of them walked over I closed my eyes scared of what was about to happen when all of a sudden my hair was pulled back hard and I opened my eyes.  I  looked up and saw my daughter carly.  She said she was thirsty and I was screaming in my sleep.  Extremely confused I looked at my phone and it was 2:37.  I was hyperventilating at this point but got up to get her some water. \n\n\nI took her back upstairs and tucked her in bed and went back down stairs.  I flopped on the couch thinking about the weird dream I had just had.  i proceeded to reach for the romote and change the channel to adult swim and fell asleep I woke up to my wife curling up next to me on the couch saying she missed me in bed that night I chuckled a sigh of relief when I noticed I had drank the entire bottle of rum, realizing that the was the cause of my terrible nightmares.  My wife reached over to change the channel to the morning news. \n\n\n The headline of the morning story stated Dan Kelper had been murdered last night with a crowbar in his home, Dans wife found him beaten to death and called the police.

There is some debate about the ethics of this, but what those scientists may not realize is that there's already data. \n\nYou see, the ability to do what they are attempting has been around for at least twenty years or so.

Also, I'm sure the public is unaware of lots of technology that's out there. I'm sorry I don't know much about the origins of this in particular – it's kind of hard to track, for so many reasons. But I will tell you what I know.\n\nYou see, when that girl went to have her head scanned, they did an X-ray. There was something small tangled into her brain. Her technician friend really thought she should see a specialist, but the girl said no. The technician couldn't tell anyone anyway, as he'd used work resources after hours, plus he didn't know her well enough to risk his job.\n\nThe reason she didn't want to see a doctor was because, like most of our group, she had come to mistrust and even hate medical and mental health professionals. If we go in to someone and explain our symptoms, then we're told they're a result of a traumatic childhood and that we should work on it in therapy. If we take it a step further and mention that we think there's something inside of us causing the symptoms, we are now psychotic and should take heavy meeds. \n\nSo how did we get to the conclusion that what was in her head was a microchip? Well, it's a whole long story and I respect the group enough not to divulge too much, as it could endanger others. But basically, the tech guy took a picture the girl's X-ray to a friend who was studying to be a surgeon, who found it sufficiently weird to where she then took it to a brain surgeon she knew. In short, it appeared to be something metallic that was positioned in a way that made operating to have it removed extremely high risk. The surgeon said that unless it was causing extraordinary problems for whoever had it, he would refuse to even try to get it out.\n\nAt this point, the two original members of the group found a third person with the same symptoms and they set up the communication network we use today. As they were trying to figure out what was going on, they came across [this group](http:\/\/www.freedomfchs.com\/). Basically, they're a bunch of people that believe they have been implanted with chips that are used for surveillance and torture. I'm not going to say whether or not they're right, as I have no way of knowing that. Their stories don't exactly fit our group's symptoms, but the it set off the chain of thoughts that, in the end, led to the following theory:\n\nA highly selective network of people exists in the U.S. We don't know how big or small it is, but suspect that it isn't huge. In the early nineties, they started using a new experimental technology that possibly was an offshoot of something a network member (or members) was working on for either the government or a medical organization. They made these microchips that they would insert into the brains of children. (While two of the earliest ones we've found are in slightly varying locations on the heads, all the rest have been in approximately the same location.) \n\nWhen these chips were in place, some other technology (we haven't figured it out yet) get used to activate the chip, which then seems to redirect the brain's processing to store the memory of whatever just happened on the chip instead of in the brain. While most of us suffered severe repeated child abuse (mostly sexual), there is one person in the group who witnessed a murder. There's one other situation, too, but it's too unique to discuss here, as it might help identify the person.\n\nThe theory is that starting in the mid-2000s, the chips started failing. Whatever thought process that was supposed to lead to those memories had been getting blocked by the chip, but they started malfunctioning and instead of hiding the memories, they were released. It's like they're on a loop and demanding a ton of attention. This is what makes us feel like it's all happening again. \n\nIt might seem a bit much to think that we all have these chips because one girl had a weird X-ray, but we can't all get them. Not only are we afraid of being labeled as crazy and given inappropriate treatment (one person in the group was hospitalized on a psych ward for five months), but even if those risks weren't there, it's hard to get anyone to give us an X-ray simply because we suspect something has been implanted in our heads. One other group member got an X-ray for something else, and a similar irregularity to the first girl showed up. It's probably a good thing that her doctor was somewhat incompetent and didn't really press the issue, focusing instead on what she had originally needed the X-ray for.\n\nAs for why we have two cases outside of the U.S., we can trace both of those to America. In my case, his wife was American and they had lived in the U.S. for a little while shortly before everything that happened to me. They also regularly vacationed there. She happens to be from an area that seems to have a cluster of cases – not that we have that much data, but three of our nine cases were within a 200 mile radius of each other. That's not counting my case, which happened in another country, but probably originated in that area.\n\nI know this seems to be a lot of speculation, but I can't really share all of our evidence, as that might identify other people in our group. But the theory seems pretty solid to us, based on the information we have gathered.\n\nI wish this was where it ended: We're working on figuring it out and maybe someday the chips will stop working altogether or we'll get them removed or something. Maybe we could get this network arrested. But it gets even worse.\n\nI hate to leave you with an unfinished story yet again, but someone from the network found me earlier this month. Because what happened was so traumatic and happened so recently, I really don't feel like I can write up what happened right now. It's too exhausting. I'll get to it later today, I promise, unless I get taken again. I think I'm safe for now, though. I've been in hiding the whole time I've been writing this story, but I'm moving to a new location after posting this and answering your comments. Having said what I just did, there is a chance they'll find this post because I think they have something set up on the Internet to track certain keywords and phrases. \n\nIt might seem foolish for me to post this if this is the case, but if anything happens to me, my group is (rightly) too concerned for their own safety to risk helping me. That's why I am putting this out there. The group needs to protect itself, but someone needs to hold these guys accountable. I'll keep trying to work on it, but they already found me once and I bet they can find me again.\n\nI know most of you who did take me seriously probably just stopped believing because of the claims made in this post. I understand – I probably would dismiss it, too, if it wasn't my own experience. But if you believe me and I don't post again later today, something bad happened. I don't want to endanger the group or those close to me. My life isn't worth enough to do that. But I want to leave this story as evidence that there is a sinister network out there, that I was targeted and that they still are around and trying to track us down.\n\nHopefully I'll be able to tell you more about that this evening."},"345":{"title":"My foster sister who lived with me for about a year.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/k216z\/my_foster_sister_who_lived_with_me_for_about_a\/","flair":null,"author":"UNDEADxxBUBBLEZ","selftext":"Okay.

Paint my toes, slip on a pair of stilettos, and from the knees down? I’m the perfect woman. Seriously, if you had a police line-up, but could only see from the knees down, you’d pick my calves and feet as the cutest every time.\n\nIt’s a gift and a curse.\n\nCan’t get a girlfriend, but my lower fourth can get any guy I want.\n\nBoo-hoo, right?\n\n*Right.*\n\nAnyways, Simon brought the kitten over along with his gear. He’s thinks she’s got potential. *Star* quality.\n\nWhatever.\n\nHe thought the kitten that he brought last month had star quality too. Her name was Firefly. She had a brown coat and blue eyes. *Cute.*\n\nAs usual, once Simon got the camera rolling, I strapped on my stilettos and played with Firefly. I made her run this way and that with this little wand I have that has bright feathers on the end. She would pounce for the feathers every time. \n\nThen Simon turned on the music. Same song every month. \n\nWhen Simon hits play, that means it’s showtime. \n\nI dropped the wand and walked over to Firefly. Rolling her onto her back with my toe, I rubbed her belly with my foot. \n\nFirefly suckled the toe of my stiletto, using her claws to hold it in place. I smiled down at her. She was a cutie.\n\nI slowly shifted my weight to the stiletto that had Firefly pinned to the tile. She quit suckling the toe of my stiletto and instead started hissing, trying to get out from under foot. I smiled down and shushed her as I put more and more weight on her little body.\n\nI’m not sure if the point of the stiletto slipped into her belly first, or if the first pop of a rib sounded in the room. Maybe both happened at the same time. Either way, Firefly started panicking.\n\nIt was fucking *adorable.*\n\nShe almost got out from under my foot so I had to press down with all my weight. Her chest collapsed in a medley of wet crunches and snaps. Firefly screamed as the point of my stiletto clicked against the tile. \n\nCan you imagine how stepping on a frozen, empty bird’s nest feels?\n\nNow you know what crushing a kitten feels like.\n\nA pool of blood—it’s always darker than you expect—formed beneath Firefly's hips. Small trickles leaked from both corners of her open mouth. She seemed to be having trouble breathing.\n\nI waited until I saw the life leave her eyes before I lifted my foot and kicked her off. Her flattened body slid across the tile towards the camera.\n\nSimon paid me and I headed home.\n\nThe kitten purring at my ankles right now is named Christmas. At least that’s what Simon said her name was. He probably named her that in the spirit of the holiday.\n\n*Christmas.*\n\nSimon’s a sick fuck.\n\nAnyways, y’all have a nice night. I’m going to play with Christmas.\n\nSimon just turned on the music.

Me (24 M) and my wife (25 W) recently bought a house from an elderly women but while we were chatting she told us something odd, \"Never open the door at 3:57 AM.\" Me and my wife did an awkward laugh but she looked dead serious.\n\n Fast forward a few years and it's my wife's 27th birthday. We invited a few friends over the night before and planned to celebrate at midnight. It's around 3:20 AM and we want to order a pizza. We are playing some board games and drinking when we hear the doorbell ring. My wife's best friend gets up to answer it and I tap ce over at the clock, 3:57 AM. I had a bad feeling in my gut but shook it off. I heard the sound of the door opening followed by a scream, a crack, and a thud. Everyone stops and rush over and what I see will haunt me forever. She was dead, her body bent in ways it should never be, blood dripping from her mouth, and she was pale almost paper white. My wife is on the floor crying at this point and while I comfort her I remember we have a ring camera! I pull out my phone and look at the app, nothing. No one was there, \"but how no one's there?\" I say to myself. Me and my wife immediately tell everyone to get out and we head back to bed but I can't fall asleep and I'm pretty sure she is awake.\n\n\nIt's the next morning and we don't talk or eat, we just head to work. 3:50 AM I stayed up then heard the stairs creaking. My wife told me she couldn't sleep and came down to check. 3:57 AM. We heard knocks followed by the sound of bones cracking, a chill went down my spine. I mustered up the courage and opened the door, there it was. 6ft tall, pale skin, it was so skinny you could see the outline of its bones, and its eyes were all black. SNAP. My wife is on the floor dead, I shut the door but forget to lock it and I immediately run to the upstairs bathroom and lock the door. \n\nI can hear the knocks and the sound of bones cracking. “Come out to make it easier for both of us!” It said to me in a deep but high pitched voice. More aggressive knocks and bone cracking i’m getting scared. “Come on just come out pleaseee??” It begged me in a child-like voice. “No.” I responded in a scared voice. “No,” was all I could say without crying. It laughed or at least I think it did. It sounded like a laugh with a cry and of course more bone cracking. It's almost 5 AM. My phone is about to die and my wife is dead. Please help me get rid of it and get out. There are no windows and I feel trapped. It's about to break the door down."},"349":{"title":"My real dark web experience","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/7ek3zv\/my_real_dark_web_experience\/","flair":null,"author":"gibshampow","selftext":"My real deep web experience \nAs any other story started it was a few months ago...I’m a teen that always stayed home from school and was always on the internet I’m always curious and like to get spooked. \n\nAnd then I came across the topic of the deep web at first I thought it was fake but then as soon as I got into a bit more research into it I figured out how to download tor on my phone. I looked into the dangers and risks but I figured eh I like to take risks so I clicked from link to link on the hidden wiki, Daniels links, etc. found you know the casual stuff like drugs and weapons. I tried my best to avoid the cp and anything related to that. \n\nI found random sites that were forums about people talking about fantasy and random stories. Then at the end of the day I decided to stop and go to sleep. So then the next day when I got home from school I got this call from a random number and so I answered it anyway in case it’s an important call...and it was silence for about 5 seconds.\n\nI usually hang up the phone at this point but I kept listening and then I heard mumbling\/whispering. I was creeped out and I realized that it could be a possibility that maybe someone on the deep web is watching me... I thought to myself maybe this is a warning... I decided to stop because anyway for now. \n\nLater in few months past and I was wanting to get back on the dark web and see what new sites are up. So then I was searching on the red browsers search engine and found a messed up site like was a social network for psychos and me and my curious self I continued and made an account and I see that the time stamp was from a few weeks ago....thinking to myself wow that’s recent for the deep web... I continue to these posts on this site. \n\nPeople talking about their crave for cp and gore. I was disgusted then I clicked on the images and it was filled with dead bodies and dead children. So got off the dark web for the day. Few weeks later I get curious and go back to the site finding out that now they have a psycho version of YouTube... they don’t have very many videos but it seems to be either porn or gore. \n\nA video that I think was named a mother and a son with 1 baseball bat. I was thinking this is gotta be fake so I opened the video and started watching the video was taken by the mother and the little boy was sitting on a bed with a music box.....the Mom says “you know what you did was wrong and you need to apologize”. They kid in silence with just the music box playing sits there then gets up with a baseball bat and hit his mother on the head as the mother falls to the ground seeing the moms reaction and bruising then the kid hits her again and again until her face is disfigured. Gosh this was getting a little to far in disturbing... every swing you can hear the kid crying almost like he doesn’t mean to do this to his mother. \n\nThen finally on his last swing her head comes off with blood splattered on a white sheet on the right side off the screen. After seeing this I almost got a panic attack Because that was way too extreme...after that experience I’ve been more cautious on what I look at.

It started about 7pm and the few of us the went the distance didn't get home until after 6am the next day.\nI'm massively wishing I didn't go the distance, I'd much rather been called a pussy and left at 1 or 2am - then I wouldn't be in this fuckin mess.\n\nMy mate who was getting married came down from another state to get hitched, and most of his mates came over too.. so I don't really know his mates too well.. but I know they are in the army and can drink like motherfuckers.\nI'm not in the army, but I can drink all night and still be pretty much with it.\n\nSo back to the bucks.. lets just say our pubcrawl ended up at strip-bar which was fine, except I didn't realise one of the groomsman paid one of the strippers for sexual favours. Now I also didn't realise that this dude had been sneaking in to the pokies at all the pubs we were visiting and playing them between drinks... I also didn't know that he won a whole lot of cash that night. I'm guessing it must have been upwards of $5k.. because he paid a stripper to blow four guys in our bucks party. Now.. I know she didn't blow me.. but she did shove her tits in my face more than a few times throughout the evening.. so I went home smelling of booze and stripper perfume..\nThis is where things get fucked up. I fully got busted for getting a lapdance, because I stank like stripper skank when I got home and I admitted it.\n\nMy GF was pretty mad but after a few days seemed to get over it.. right up until tonight when she got a call by my mate's GF who said that she was told that all of the boys got BJ's at the strip-club.\nTurns out one of these army meat heads got remorse (and hopefully herpes) and spilled the beans to his missus.. but said WE ALL GOT BLOWN to make it seem like it is less of a thing if we all were in on it.. which is total bullshit.\n\nAnyway my GF didn't tell me about the call until after dinner tonight.. and she was all nice to me making me lasagna with wine.. and homemade garlic bread. She told be about the call, and I said it was a total lie, and I did not get a BJ AT ALL.. she just said it doesn't matter and went to bed and that was like 2 hours ago.. and now I'm thinking what the FUCK is going on? I'm totally stressed that she may have put something in my fucking food or something? I'm fucking looking at the knife block and there is a fucking knife missing too... it is fucking freezing outside and I have to work in 5 hours and I haven't slept and I'm in the study with a fucking mirror next to the screen so I can see behind me.\n\n\n***UPDATE***\n\nI managed to get a friend to answer their phone and they are going to drive around to pick me up. I told them to park down the road and leave the boot open, because I'm bringing my full sized gaming machine with me.. and my dog, but my mate doesn't know about the dog yet.\nSigning off so I can shut the machine down and disconnect, I'll leave the screen and shit behind, that stuff is cheap to replace.\nI just need to make this shit happen quietly. I'm scared to take my eyes of this mirror, but I need to get moving, I'm losing my fucking mind here.\nAs soon as I let the dog out of the laundry he is going to go mental and make a racket.. so I'm going to go in to the laundry and close the door behind me and open the back door and leave with the computer and the dog, out the side gate and down the street with no shoes on in the fucking freezing dark.\nI'll post back from my mates granny flat if I make it out of here.\nthanks for listeneng to my crazy situation.  - RJC\n\n***SECOND UPDATE***\n\nSo made it out and I noticed my GF had the light on in the bedroom as I bolted down the street with my dog and PC.\nI got a txt from her while my mate drove me (btw he was pissed that I brought my dog with me). \nThe txt read: \"You're fucked\".. \n\nI txt back \"I DIDN'T GET A FUCKING BJ... WHY HAVE YOU GOT A KNIFE???\"\n\nGF: \"The knife is not for you asshole\"..\n\nI told my mate to stop the car... I showed him the messages and he just said \"What the fuck?\" I told him to drive back and wait in the car while I go and check on her..\n\nSo I go back and the front door was open, the bedroom light was off but I could see a light at the end of the house.. I walked in and I could hear the radio I saw the knife on the floor of the hallway so I picked it up and carried to the kitchen. GF was sitting at the kitchen table.. when I stepped into the light I could see some blood on the blade so I chucked in the sink and ran over to Marlena. She looked like she was half asleep, but she wasn't injured in any way.. I asked her what happened? where'd the blood come from? but her eyes kinda rolled back in her head and she slowly slumped forward as if she was falling asleep.\n\nI called the cops and they asked if I needed an ambo, I said I wasn't sure, but after I described the condition of my GF they said they were dispatching one.\n\nSo the ambos picked up my GF and took her to the emergency, while the cops questioned me for a while before asking me if I would come back to the cop shop. They checked all the rooms in the house to see if there were other people. I asked if I was under arrest, they said no, but they have more questions. They baggied up the knife and I took a ride with them.\nI was at the station for four hours and had to speak to four different people, I think 2 were detectives and the other was a domestic violence officer or detective. \n\nThey said that the knife was at a forensic lab and if the blood came back human, they would detain me while they search for the victim. They also said they had sent 2 officers to the hospital to talk to my GF.\nI explained the WHOLE story to them but they thought it was strange that I left the house in the middle of the night with no shoes on.\n\nAnyway, finally they said that it wasn't blood, they said it was some sort of starch. They gave me some brochures on relationship counselling and mental health, and they let me go.\n\nI tried calling my GF but someone else answered and said she couldn't talk right now. I phoned the hospital to ask about her, but they wouldn't give me any patient details over the phone.\n\nSo I felt pretty shitty when I got home and decided to pack a bag and drive to the hospital to see if I could stay the night in her room.\n\nI rang another one my mates who was at the bucks (not the dude with the car) to tell them what was going on and he was pretty shocked.. apparently one of the guys that got a BJ was getting a separation from his wife.. but because the army boys had gone home we don't really know what happened to them. I told my mate not to tell the groom about what's going on, because I didn't want it to spoil their honeymoon. I said I didn't want the bride to find out about the BJ's at the strip bar, but my mate said that she already knew and he thought everyone knew about the strip bar weeks ago???!!!??Which is fucking weird because NOBODY TALKED ABOUT IT AT THE WEDDING.\n\nI got off the phone pretty confused and drove to the hospital..\nWhen I got there, they said that she had taken quite a few sleeping pills. They said the bloods were ok but she'd be drowsy for quite a while, because they didn't let her sleep for ages. They said they kept her awake for quite some time.\n\nI asked if I could stay and they said no, but I could go in to see her.\nI went in to see her and she opened her eyes when I sat down next to the bed. I didn't say much and neither did she. I said that I could't stay but she grabbed my jacket as I went to stand up and she said \"the stripper is gone\". I sort of stood there thinking what the fuck did she just say? she sat up and pushed the call button. A nurse came in and asked if everything was ok? My GF said she needed help getting up to go to the bathroom with her IV drip.\nI just said.. \"ok bye\" about turned and it's like everything is a blur.

Their numbers had grown without respite for a few years now, due to a lack of adequate gelding. And so the males had consistenty (and vigorously, I might add) inspermated the females, whose orifices would be dripping with cat cum as they jumped on the dinner tables and fish dissectories. \n\nAs it would happen, the main problem with this proliferation of cats turned out to be the death of several Esteemed Members on the stairways that interconnect the dormitories and cafeterias of our Last Stand. When Sigun Lazdil broke his neck on stairway 419B, it was decreed by poem:\n\n> In the hall of Esteemed, shadows grow,\n> Thirteen felines, ordained to bestow.\n> Not a sentence of hate, but necessity's flow.\n> \n> Under the moon, their silhouettes glow,\n> Life to release, for balance we owe.\n> In the dance of the world, such seeds were sow. \n> \n> Do not perceive this act as woe, \n> Each stroke of blade, a mercy to show.\n> For in their end, the beginnings we know. \n\nBy this decree the Esteemed Members of Machinecover knew that we must filet and dissect a full 13 of our ragdolls.\n\nHowever it went horribly wrong.\n\nFirstly, no one amongst the Esteemed Members was assigned to clean up the various cartilage, sinews, bones, furs, lip-tentacles (antennae?), ears, eyelashes, claws, little paws, leg pieces, muscles, cat intestines, and other aspects that remained after the actions were carried out according to the decree.\n\nInstead they were left uncovered, on the floors, in the cabins, upon the dressers, and wherever else Esteemed Members saw fit to leave them after the dismemberment had been done. Yet no Clean-Selves, Collect-Selves, or Recycle-Selves were dispatched accordingly.\n\nAs a result, a great malady descended upon the residents of Machinecover. Something came up from the depths of releality, summoned by the cat cries, and homing in on the various rotting fleshes and flayed carcasses strewn about the interiors of the Esteemed Members. \n\nFirst it was merely a shadow: clinging to the corners and sticking to the sidereal. The corneas of the residents of Machinecover indeed kept catching side-glances and flashes of its abominatory shadoweference, yet it remained undetected by the Esteemed Guard. \n\nHowever next, it became vociferous. The cries of the suffering and dying cats would echo nightly through the cavernous corridors and descending switchbacks of Machinecover. Their horrific meows and murrooowws would ceaselessly interrupt our Sleep-Selves, arresting rest and disturbing dreams. \n\nFinally, it became aggressive and quite physical. \n\nFirst to go was Minkot \"Maze\" Osednish, a purveyor of Phantom of Skulls literature, known for being a little tight with her resources.  It came to her cabin at thrice past nocturne, skimming through the crack beneath her door at the end of the culdesac off Stairway 142C. Her teeth were found and identified by Intercover officers, yet aside from the nerves dangling from their roots, no other trace of Maze ever was found. \n\nNext to go was Zefon Norammafol, an unemployed Engraver. A child delivering his supper discovered his right wrist, perfectly sectioned off like a disc of arm, balanced perfectly upon the doorknob of his commode-chamber.

I expected Lisa to take the lead, like she had been this whole time.  Instead, she seemed to cower to the back of our small group.  I turned to face her and noticed both Yamir and Emma had moved behind me as well.  I was our leader now.  I had made the rocks crumble and the opening appear.  Now, I had to lead us to the exit.  I had to lead us to the end. \n\nI walked through the opening and stopped a few feet in, deciding to give my eyes a moment to adjust to the darkness.   It was no use, I couldn’t see my own hands in front of me and there was a sour taste in my mouth.  It smelled like rotten eggs, like sulfur.  I could feel one of them breathing on my neck, I spun around.  I no longer saw any light from the room that we were in before, “Guys, what do we do now?”\n\nThere was no answer, I could still feel breathing on my neck and reached out to touch a body, “Yamir?”  \n\nNo answer, “Who is this?”\n\nI found their hand and squeezed it, nothing.  \nI swung my left arm out and felt another body.  It was unresponsive.  \n\nI stumbled around in the darkness and grasped the three hands belonging to my three friends who wouldn’t move or speak.\n\nIt was a joke, a sick terrible and cruel joke, “Guys!” I shouted, “This isn’t funny anymore!”\n\n“Please!” I begged, “What’s going on?”\n\n“Lisa! “ I sobbed, “Answer me!”\n\nI’m not sure how long I grasped at the three bodies, shouting, begging, and, sobbing.  At some point the silence won out and I became one of the quiet and motionless bodies.  I wanted to be wherever they were.  I thought about feeling for walls, but I felt safe in the triangle of bodies.  I stood there and the silence ate away at me.  The darkness and the silence worked together until it was drowning me.  I was breathing it in and poisoning my lungs.  It was choking me.  I began howling.\n\nThe awful, sick howling that I’d heard earlier started coming from my own twisted mouth.  My jaw began to ache and I thought violent things.  Like carving out Yamir’s heart so he could never love Lisa and slaughtering my parents so they could never argue again.  The gnashing of the teeth came from the bodies surrounding me.  They gnashed at one another and I couldn’t see them but I could hear them and I could feel them moving around me, tearing away at one another.  \n\nTheir echoes bounced off of the walls surrounding me and they yelled for a name, for a girl, for a sister, “Leslie!” they howled, “Leslie!”\n\nShe isn’t here, I thought.  “She’s never coming back,” I said and I heard it echoed back to me as the darkness finally took me with it, “Leslie,” it echoed, “she’s never coming back!\n\nI woke up in a hospital some time later.  There were IV’s sticking from my arm and I felt like my head was caved in.  The doctors surrounded me in their lab coats and they talked about me like I wasn’t there.  Words and phrases like, “severely dehydrated,” “malnourished,” and “mentally unstable,” floated around the hospital room like the big red balloons someone had left at my bedside table.  \n\nWhen my parents reported me missing, the police asked if I had been exhibiting any strange behavior.  My dad told them that he believed I’d broken into his office several times and that’s where he kept all of his work.  The police decided to have the cave my dad was working in completely searched.  They found me deep within the cave, alone, without anything on me.  I was incoherent and apparently babbling about someone named Johnny and the sacrifices he was planning.\nIn the months following, bits and pieces of what happened to me in Moab began to come together.  \n\nThere was a reason I constantly found myself mixing up the names of Leslie and Lisa.  It was all coming back as sure as the sun was setting in a sky I thought I’d never see again.  There was only ever Leslie.  My role model Leslie, my protector Leslie, my best friend Leslie, my sister Leslie.  My parents couldn’t have a kid, that’s when the tension started.  The fights began long before my father’s job was an issue.  The fights began long before Moab happened.  \n\nAnd then there was Leslie, a miracle they called her.  They explained it to me when I was younger, they said, ‘Leslie was born in our hearts, that’s why the color of her skin doesn’t match yours.’  She was adopted, but then I happened.  I was the ‘accident’ Leslie had joked once, but my parents always said that I was their ‘surprise.’  They must’ve been thrilled and hopeful; at least that’s what they’d always said.  I grew up and became another mouth to feed, another child for my mother to care for while my father was away and couldn’t.  I was loved, we were both loved, but I caused stress.  And with stress came tension, until I was sure it was all going to break. \n\n\nThere was darkness and I saw the flashing lights before I heard them.  The wailing that means there’s someone out there in pain and we need to get to them and we need to help them.  But they couldn’t help her.  They couldn’t help Leslie.  \nThe back left of our 1997 Toyota RAV4 was torn clean off when the driver of a tractor-trailer fell asleep at the wheel and plowed through the median.  I’m not sure how many times the car rolled but it stopped right side up.  I remember looking to my left and seeing nothing.  Seeing nothing was worse than seeing her dead next to me.  Seeing nothing meant she was gone for good, and I could never see her again.  \n\nThe casket was closed but that’s all I really remember about the time after her death.  My dad had been driving the car.  He was in the driver’s seat, on the left, suppose it had been the front left instead of the back left part of our car torn off?  What then?  I’m sure my mom juggled those questions a lot.\n\nThe same darkness that I experienced in the cave, that was the kind of darkness that loomed over our slightly emptier household.  There was a strange silence where Leslie’s voice should’ve been.  I remembered dealing with ignorant and mean kids growing up who would tell me that Leslie wasn’t really my sister, that a white girl could never really be my sister.   I always knew they were wrong and that it didn’t matter.  She was my sister even if she wasn’t my flesh and blood.  But when she died, I believed them.  I believed that she wasn’t my sister anymore and that was the worst darkness of all.\n\nWe would’ve moved regardless of the job offer.  It just helped that my dad already had a job lined up in the town we were moving to.  My parents hoped that it would help get rid of the pain that had a face and a name.  I hoped it would get rid of the pain too.\n\nFor that first month or so it did seem to help me block out the pain.  Mostly because I was numb to everything around me.  Apparently it isn’t good psychologically for a teenager experiencing severe emotional trauma to have no interaction with his peers.  That’s why I met Lisa.  She was my coping mechanism. \n\nMy mind didn’t fill in all of the details surrounding her because she wasn’t a real person; instead, my mind gave Lisa the attributes of Leslie with the personality and looks to match while Lisa’s sister Leslie was a completely different character my mind had created.  \n\nThe time Lisa came to my house, the therapist’s say that the conversation she had with my mom was a memory my brain had made up; most likely, it was based off a true event that had happened before Leslie died.  They say I paired the fabricated memory with the conversation I had imagined while picking the lock on my dad’s office door and rifling through his things.\n\nThey say most of the memories are like this.  There was a hotel though, but there was no Yamir.  He was a figment of my imagination as well, that’s what the therapists told me.  They believe Yamir represented my insecurities.  A few weeks after they found me in the cave, a hotel receptionist came forward and said that she’d seen me in Yamir’s hotel.  I listened to her tell the police and doctors that she’d seen me talking in a hushed voice, but no one was around me.  A few minutes after she’d seen me go in there, she called security and found that I had gone up to the roof.  She went up there, unsure of how I’d gotten in, and found me standing on the rooftop all alone during late twilight.  Since I wasn’t doing anything wrong, and she could tell I was very upset, she decided to leave me alone.\n\nEmma and Johnny were also just figments of my imagination.  People my own mind made up to add to the realistic world and storyline I was creating for myself.  There were things the police and doctors weren’t certain about; for instance, how I had gotten to the cave.  There was no evidence of anyone driving me and there was no car to suggest that I’d driven myself.  \n\nAll of this knowledge, it wasn’t something that all returned to me at once.  As I became more stable, I started to put together the bits and pieces.  I started to hold onto the information and events the doctors and police told me about.  I started to remember them as being true.  I got better, but I was still shaky on the same events no one else could piece together.  I still have no clue what really happened in that cave, just the dark and tainted memories that I do a good job of keeping out.   \n\nIt was difficult to deal with, I dreamed up realities where there really was satanic worship and I barely made it out alive.  Those dreams were easier than trying to comprehend my own insanity.  Sometimes I’d even dream that Lisa made it out alive with me, that somehow I’d rescued her and was a hero.  \n\nWe left Moab not too long after I started to forget and remember, remember and forget.  We moved to Minnesota and my dad helped advise construction on the lakes.  It was a beautiful place to live and even though we’d always mourn Leslie and hide from what happened in Moab, Minnesota helped us begin to heal.  I never witnessed my father lay a hand on my mother after Moab and I never saw nasty bruises on her face or arms after Moab.  I wondered if that was a part of what I’d imagined.  I wondered if that darkness was just in my head too.  \n\nNow here I am, sitting behind my computer, talking with you all.  The year is 2015, and it has been almost 16 years since what happened to me in Moab.  The only thing that remains the same is that I believe in God.  I believe in God because I found darkness in Utah that was so thick and tangible that it proved to me the devil exists.  You can’t have one without having the other.  Moab, Utah made me believe in the devil; because of this, Moab, Utah made me believe in God.  \n\nNow I go to church often, my church is actually where I met my wife.  I moved with her back to Baltimore a few years ago and she’s pregnant with a baby girl.  Even though that darkness is in my past, I do my best to eliminate it by filling my life with the light of my God.  That’s my coping mechanism now.  \n\nNormally, I wouldn’t have brought this to Reddit, but something happened two days before my first post that caused me to write this.  My wife was upstairs resting because she had done some cleaning while I was off at work; side note, I’m a history teacher now if that interests any of you.  I was sitting in our living room on the recliner, eating a microwave dinner.  The Orioles v. Angel’s game had just started, and I was happy to be relaxing before I had to start grading some papers.  There was a knock at the door, and I considered waiting till the commercial break to answer.  I knew that’d be too long, and I didn’t want to be rude.  Finally, I dramatically sat my recliner up right before climbing out of the pleather upholstery and crossing the few feet to the door.  I opened the door and my heart ceased to beat.\n\nThere was a man in front of me who was a spitting image of Yamir if he had been fifteen or sixteen years older.  He looked at me with warm brown eyes and said, “It’s Lisa.  She needs our help.”  \n\nI told him not to say another word and to go away or I would call the cops.  As long as he doesn’t come back, I’m not going to do anything.  This is all in my past.  My wife doesn’t even know about what happened to me in Utah.  She knows that I had a sister, Leslie, who passed away but that’s about all of my darkness that she’s seen.  \n\nI’m trying to convince myself that no one ever knocked on my door, that I didn’t see Yamir, and that I didn’t hear him saying Lisa’s name again after so many years.  Forget and remember.  Remember and forget.  Just like the doctor’s told me.  \n\nLater on, when I was laying in bed with my wife, she turned to me and I found myself appreciating her effortless beauty that radiated from all corners of her being.  \n\n“I think I know what I want to name our princess,” she was smiling and I was loving her smile.\n\n“And what’s that?” I took her hands in mine.\n\nHer hands felt cold, “Lisa.”\n\nI didn’t answer.  \n\nWe said our prayers\n\nAnd\n\nWe said our Goodnights.\n"},"353":{"title":"The Third Wish.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/10mjjm\/the_third_wish\/","flair":null,"author":"lazlme","selftext":"An elderly man was sitting alone on a dark path.

My friends actually started watching it again shortly before \"Day of the Doctor\" was released. \"So we won't forget a single moment\", they said, but I digress. One of my friends, Alex, is practically the \"Smitty Werbenjagermanjensen\" of Doctor Who, in other words, #1 fan. He asked me to draw a Weeping Angel so he could use it as a prank on his little brother or something like that, and I was the known cartoonist\/artist of the group. At first I refused because,frankly, I wouldn't even be able to look at the thing without shivering, but after some persuasion (and free lunch) I gave in. \n\nI went back to my grandparents' house. I'm staying with them until my parents get back from that cruise they went to in 2011, and they're still not back. They can't be dead though, no newspaper headlines stating that the ship sank, nor any phone calls from the police.....but I digress. Anyhoo, as soon as I got finished from that essay, I decided I would get started on my Weeping Angel, because I did NOT want to fry my brain with that quiz (college life can be so hard). Let me mention before-hand that my grandparents have a garden with a fountain and a statue and everything, and now everything I am about to tell you will make sense. I went on Google images, got out a Weeping Angel and my sketch book, and began to draw. I began with the head, and when I got done with that and started on the eyes, I started shivering. For absolutely no reason. Until I looked outside the window.Wasn't there a statue over at the fountain? I don't remember it being right next to the flower pot. These thoughts went through my head as I stared at the back of a statue that had apparently moved. I went back to the Weeping Angel sketch but it.....changed.What was supposed to be a close up sketch of a Weeping Angel was now a sketch of the statue outside. Now listen here when I tell you readers out there when I tell you that I wasn't like those idiots in the horror movies when they just brush off that strange occurrence and realize their mistake too late, no sir. I just GTFO.\n\n\n Exactly what I did.\n\n\n\n Noped right out of there.\n\n Fortunately, my grandparents were out on a trip to Venice and I had the house to myself, so no danger there. The real danger was in the blinking. The \"moving-around-without-taking-your-eyes-off-that-thing\" thing.*That* is where the real danger resides.\nI just kept my eyes on that statue. Just stared at that statue for so long I hadn't even noticed that the sketched statue was turned around facing me.\n"},"355":{"title":"Tried Three Kings...here's what happened to me.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/whob8\/tried_three_kingsheres_what_happened_to_me\/","flair":null,"author":"None","selftext":"So, like many other redditors, I was intrigued by the Three Kings post from a few days ago. However, the ensuing flood of posts by fellow redditors is what really got me interested in trying this out. I consider myself pretty rational and skeptical by nature, but all these other posts kept gnawing at my curiosity. I finally decided to try the Three Kings for myself last night, if nothing else than to satiate my own need to know for certain if it was in fact real or not. Here's what happened...\n\nI followed the set up outlined in the original post pretty faithfully. The only difference was that I did not have a fan. Our house has a nice basement, pitch black without the lights and no windows, so I think it was perfect for this. It being summer, most of my roommates have gone home for the break. (I share a five bedroom house off campus with four other students from my university) Luckily, one of my roommates is still here. For the sake of ease, let's call him Stu. Stu was already planning to stay up and play COD for a while so he agreed to be my failsafe. My \"power object\" was a stuffed teddy bear I had received for my birthday last year from my ex. Yeah, maybe it wasn't the best power object, but I didn't have anything better.\n\nI went to bed as it says in the instructions with my alarm set for 3:30AM. I woke up at 3:29 on my own, didn't even need the alarm after all. I guess I was really psyched for this. I went down to the room, and noticed the door was closed. At first, this gave me a little chill and for a moment I thought \"Shit, maybe it's real after all...\". I walked over to the living room real quick and asked Stu, who was busy fragging some newbs on COD, if he had closed the door. Stu...well stu likes to hit the bong...and he was a little stoned by this point, it took him a second, and then he was like \"Oh, shit dude...sorry...I forgot that you left it open on purpose.\" False Alarm.\n\nSo, after reminding Stu to come get me at the appointed time, I went back into the room and sat down in the \"throne\", making sure not to look into either mirror. I'll admit it's a little creepy. Sitting in a dark room, the only light coming from your flickering candle, flanked by two mirrors that you can just only see in your peripheral vision. It's creepy. Five minutes passed and nothing happened. Then ten minutes, then fifteen minutes...NOTHING HAPPENED. Then I started getting sleepy (it was 3:50 something after all). I don't know when I fell asleep, but at some point I nodded off right there on the throne. When I woke up,...it was already daylight. I had apparently spent the night sleeping on the floor next to my \"throne\". What a joke. Fucking Stu and his lazy stoner ass forgot to get me. I walk out into the living room and there he is, passed out on the couch, bong on the coffee table, xbox controller in his lap. Lucky for me the Three Kings was a bust, if some real exorcist shit had gone down I would have been screwed. Haha. \n\nBut, seriously...to anyone out there who was like me reading these posts and wondering...if just maybe there was some truth to this thing. Just do it. You'll always have that nagging doubt until you do it. No need for any of the failsafes or a friend because it's not real. Just wake up at 3:30, walk on down and sit on the throne. And you know what....just go ahead and stare right into the left mirror. Because there's nothing there. Just do it. Do it tonight.

You see, lately the USA has become known as a country filled with fat, stupid people, and as a proud, wholesome man who loves where he lives, this is troubling to me. So I took it upon myself to get rid of this stereotype one person, and one state, at a time. This may scare many of you if you happen to be a bad kind of person. \n\nI started in Mississippi. Odell Smith was what most people thought of in Mississippians: he was a wifebeater, a slob, and a racist. He got a taste of his own medicine when I lynched him the way he'd lynched the blacks 40 years ago. Sure, he was an older man, but he was still deserving of death. I hung him up and set his obese wriggling body on fire until it was a charred, smoky corpse. \n\nIt was a pleasure doing this. I was able to satisfy my deep, dark desires and improve America's image. I went on to Houston, Texas, and employed a Mexican man, Hector Rios, to work for me. It was his illegal scum that was souring good old Texas's image, so once I had him alone in my garden, explaining what I wanted him to do, I grabbed the garden shears and drove them right through his skull. I buried his body under my flower bed, sold the house, and moved on. \n\nIn Miami, Florida, I picked up Maria, a sexy young Cuban girl who had taken to prostitution. Once I had her alone in my car, I strangled her with her own belt. Then, in Connecticut, I abducted snobbish, obnoxious 14-year-old Amber Whitaker, the spoiled and idiotic daughter of a wealthy lawyer, from the Bridgeport mall. Back at my place, I shot her and dumped the corpse far out in the Atlantic. After her, I killed Gino Morretti, who was stereotypical of the \"Jersey trash\" you'd see on the Jersey shore. \n\nI don't want to bore you with details, redditors, but I think you'd be interested to know that my next few stops included Oklahoma (where I killed a nutty religious homophobic mother abusing her gay son), Kansas (where I killed a Methodist pastor who spent too much time collecting money and not enough practicing what he preached), and Alabama (where I killed a Ku Klux Klan member). \n\nYou can thank me, my fellow Americans, for helping rid the nastiest stereotypes of the US.

I used to buy collectible items like coins and stuff. Well one day I was browsing around craigslist when I saw a really good deal on a 1901 coin. My first instinct was of course to buy it so I looked it over and it seemed like the real deal (note-some coins are fake). I emailed the guy about the offer and eventually he emailed me back. In the email he didn't really talk about the coin but I just put off and emailed him about the coin again. This time he actually talked about the coin and he sent me some more pictures of it.\n\n\n\nA couple days later after close consideration I decided to buy the coin so I emailed him and asked where we could meet. He said he worked days and he got off at 9:00 pm and it takes about an hour to get home so I said I would wait his house until he got home and make the deal. He said that was a good idea so we decided I should stop by tomorrow. \n\n\n\nThe next day I ate dinner at around 8:45 and then left because it would take me about an hour to get there. (note-the guy lives away from the city in a pretty remote area.) When I got there I grabbed my 15 dollars and waited for him to get there. While I was waiting my car battery died and started to feel pretty sleepy. I tried my best to stay awake but just as I was about to pass out I saw headlights in the distance. I looked at my watch and it was 10:00 pm.\n\n\nThe car pulled into the house's driveway and a middle aged looking guy with glasses and long hair got out of the car.

I told him it would be quicker if he just brought the coin out here but he insisted I went in. I finally just agreed with him and went inside. His house looked like something from the early 1900's. It was only 1 story and made of old bricks. When we got in it smelled like thousands of dead animals in one room. We sat down in the kitchen and talked. After 2 minutes of talking I asked about the coin.He said he has it in his room and he went to go get it.\n\n\nWhile I sat there I was sure I heard voices coming from the door next to the chair I was sitting in. When the guy got back I asked him about it and he said it was just his radio playing in the basement. I payed him the 15 dollars but he said he needed more. I told him  I did not bring any more money and that he said it would only be 15 dollars. He got very angry and he hit the table very hard. I quickly grabbed the coin and ran outside to my car. I got in my car and locked the doors. I tried to start but I remembered the battery was dead. The guy came running out of his house with a gun and shot my window. He reached for the lock but I smacked his hand away. That's when I blacked out.\n\n\n\nI woke up in a room filled with chains and other weapons. There were two other people in there missing limbs and covered in blood. I freaked out and tried to get up but I was tied up. Lucky for me there was a piece of glass next to me and one of my hands were loosely tied up so I grabbed it and cut my tied hand free. I cut the rope around my legs and got up. I grabbed a gun from the table and went upstairs. The guy was asleep so I didn't have to use the weapon. I sneaked around the house to find a phone and eventually found one and dialed 9-1-1.\n\n\nWhen the cops got there they arrested the main and said he was a wanted criminal. They unlocked the chained up people and took them to the hospital. I got a ride from the cop back to my house and I went to sleep. \n\n\nNow three years later i'm writing this story because the guy is about to get out of jail because he claimed it was his friends house and he didn't know and some how the judge believed him. The guy gets out of jail on March 1st of 2018. I already got an email from an unknown person telling me to watch my back. I will update this in March if anything happens.\n"},"362":{"title":"I never should have dated a Redditor [The Final Chapter]","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/2dhys2\/i_never_should_have_dated_a_redditor_the_final\/","flair":"Series","author":"Blake_Sunkist","selftext":"[Part 1](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/2de8yg\/i_never_should_have_dated_a_redditor_part_1\/)\n\nNormally, when you're on a train wreck of a date, you make an excuse to get the hell out of there. Maybe you pretend to get a text and say it's an emergency, or maybe you say you're going to the restroom when you're really going to escape through the back entrance, running and screaming. But I wasn't going to end this date. I was gonna stick it through to the end. Then she would take me back to her hotel room. And then she would die. \n\nI finally got her to talk about something besides Reddit.\n\n\"So…have you been watching any new TV shows lately? I'm really hooked on Orange is the New Black.\"  \n\n\"*What if I told you that I love that show?\"*\n\nI knew it was hopeless. No matter what we discussed, that horrible bitch would just keep on memeing. \n\n\"That's…that's so cooll! I love Netflix shows because you get the whole season all at once. I watched the first six in one day.\"\n\n\"I know! *One does not simply watch one episode at a time.*\"\n\nGoddammit…I practically set her up for that one. I almost wanted to shut up for the rest of the meal. Maybe she would only meme when spoken to.\n\n\"Piper is such an amazing character! Bad Luck Piper! *Has a great life. Goes to jail.*\"\n\nAs much as I wanted to stab her to death, I knew I couldn't do it there. But that's what was going to happen if the memes didn't stop. I had to be blunt with her.\n\n\"Leslie, you know how much I love talking to you, but…well, I don't wanna sound like a dick or anything, but….don't get me wrong, I love memes more than anything, but,…..when you say them out loud all the time, it gets kind of annoying. Could you please stop?\"\n\nI was afraid of what would happen next. Maybe she would cry or yell at me or throw her glass of wine at my face. But she was perfectly sweet about it.\n\n\"I'm so sorry! You should have said something earlier. And you let me meme this whole time, even though it annoyed you? Oh em gee, that is too sweet!\"\n\nThen she said the most wonderful thing. It was wonderful because it got us thrown out of the restaurant.\n\n\"*THIS GUY! THIS FUCKING GUY! THIS GUY GETS IT!*\" she shouted at the top of her lungs. \"*SOMEONE GIVE THIS MAN GOLD!*\"\n\n____________\n\nI was filled with nervous anticipation as we walked up to her hotel room. Actually, \"murderous anticipation\" would be a better way to describe it.\n\n\"I'm so glad you agreed to come here.. Trust me, I'll make it a night you'll never forget.\"\n\nShe was goddamn right about that.\n\n\"You are gonna *love* my friends!\"\n\n…\n\nWait, what?\n\n\"What do you mean? There are people in your room?\"\n\n\"Of course there are, you silly goose! They came along with me. You are gonna *love* them! We call ourselves \"The Meme Team.\"\n\nNo, no, no, no, no….she did not just say that. She did not. Maybe I misheard her, and what she really said was \"The Steam Team.\" Yeah, that must have been it. It made sense- They were just hardcore gamers. Nothing to worry about.\n\n\"They love memes even more than I do!\"\n\nWell, fuck. I guess this murder was gonna turn into a massacre.\n\n\"There's five of them- Good Guy Gary, Scumbag Sam- don't worry, he's not a real scumbag- Foul Bachelor Brad, Socially Awkward Andrew, and Insanity Ian. Be careful around Ian because he's legitimately insane. We have to keep him away from all sharp objects. But he's a really cool guy once you get to know him.\"\n\nI had no idea what to expect when we got to her door. Maybe it would be five guys standing around a computer discussing how to make the perfect Confession Bear. Maybe they would be furiously masturbating to a blown up photo of Good Girl Gina.\n\nShe opened the door.\n\nI wasn't expecting there to be blood everywhere, and I *really* wasn't expecting to see a guy wearing nothing but a horse mask, waving around a meat cleaver, and standing next to four severed heads.\n\n\"Ian, what the fuck? Who gave you a meat cleaver?\"\n\n*\"What if I told you I hid it in my suitcase?\"*\n\n\"Ian...*Yeah, if you could go ahead and not kill us, that would be great.*\nI know how insane you are, but you have to let us live! If I die, then the meme team dies with us! There's no 'i\" in meme team!\"\n\n\"Sorry, Leslie and whoever your friend is. *Brace yourselves…death is coming. I'm gonna cut your fucking heads off…I guarantee it.\"*\n\n\"IAN, NO! Wait, wait…if you spare us, I'll make it worth your while. I promise!\"\n\n\"That depends. What do you have in mind?\"\n\n\"I'll make a GGG meme about you. *Has five friends who are obsessed with memes. Only kills four of them.*\" \n\nIan stroked his blood-stained neckbeard as he considered her offer.\n\n\"Very well, then. I accept. The meme team shall live on.\"\n\nThen we got the fuck out of there. \n\nI was overcome with emotion. With tears streaming down my face, I wrapped my arms around Leslie and held her tight.\n\n\"I can't believe it…you… you saved my life! You're an angel!\"\n\n\"And you, sir, are a gentleman and a scholar. If I had money, I would give you gold. I wish I could upvote you more than once. THIS. So much this.\"\n\nHer words reminded me of what an annoying fucking bitch she was. My tears disappeared. The murderous rage returned.\n\n\"Say…is that a knife in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?\"\n\n\"It's a knife.\"\n\n*Stab stab stab stab stab stab*\n\nI threw her bloody corpse in the trunk of my car and drove away, feeling happy as a clam.\n\n*I killed that crazy bitch. Today was a good day.*"},"363":{"title":"FORKS (NSFW)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3fgahi\/forks_nsfw\/","flair":null,"author":"MMGrillo","selftext":"Forks\nby M.M. Grillo\n\n\nBeef jerky, Snickers bars—check!\nGame Boy, teddy bear, word search magazines—check!\nOne hot wife, two kids, age five and ten—check!\n\nI stepped on the gas and we were off on our very first family vacation. Family means everything. Jobs, friends, and good and bad fortune all come and go, but family, that remains constant. I love my family with all my heart. We don’t have much but what we have we share and try to make the best of. This vacation is nothing special, just a long meandering car ride to a beautiful little cottage lent to me for the week by an old friend.\n\nSome families yacht across the Mediterranean or take in the sites of Paris or Berlin. Us? We drive, we laugh, and we thank our lucky stars for what we have. Others may have more in riches, but we are billionaires when it comes to love. Sounds corny, I know that—but deep down it’s not corny. It’s wonderful.\n\nWhen the trip began we were flush with anticipation and excitement, and perhaps a bit of fear. Not scary chainsaw fear but the innocuous fear of the unknown. What will we experience while we were out on the road far from the comforts of our backyard barbeques and television-sofa extravaganzas? Anything could happen to anyone when they stray from their comfortable environs. A drunk driver could plow into us as we drive through the murky night, a lightning strike could burn us alive, or a tornado could topple the car. We took these useless thoughts and buried them like pirate’s treasure—far from our conscious minds. Yet still they lurked under the surface, like barbs on a rose’s stem.\n\nAllow me to take a moment to tell you about my small but lovely family. There is my wife Jane, a school teacher all 31 years of close-knit community and Sunday school lecturing. She’s one-of-a-kind, Jane is. Thick, shoulder length brown hair, wavy not curly, and bright, big eyes that seemed to suck the very soul from my being when we met lo those many years ago. Her lips, like two plump loveseats pushed together on her smooth-skinned face, like two rabbits pouncing upon a dewy meadow.\n\nMy wife, she’s a serious one, but not lacking whimsy. In fact, the funniest thing I ever heard in my entire life she said to me when we first began dating. I would share it with you but the setup is way too convoluted. Suffice it to say, she has a great sense of humor and a darting keen sense of self—two things that attracted me to her immediately.\n\nMy son is named Marty. I know, I know, don’t get me started, but it was Jane’s dad’s name and what was I going to say? As previously mentioned, he is all of ten years old but he’s as wise as a sage on a hill in Tibet arranging colored sand into the shape of SpongeBob Squarepants. He has his mother’s hair and it sits on his head like a deserted bird nest perched upon two boney shoulders. Is he funny? Yes, more like me than his mom. He has a dry wit, as they say. He sometimes reminds me of a fetus version of Bob Newhart. In fact, he looked a little like him when he was an infant. Bald, serious, and pale.\n\nChild number two is Jane Jr. I decided that gem of a name. After all, my mother’s name was Gertrude and there was no way in hell that I would curse a daughter of mine with such a name. Yikes. I picked Jane simply because I figured that if she grew into half the woman her mother is she’d be all-damn-right. I love both my girls equally. We call her JJ these days. Mostly to cut down on confusion as we holler each other’s names back and forth like war chants on an Apache battlefield. \n\nSo we drove and we drove, and we spied with our little eyes, and we guffawed like a gaggle of laughing-gassed geese. Things were going swimmingly. We drove further and further towards our cottage for the week and we couldn’t wait to get there.\n\nAfter the first full day of driving, north, straight toward our destination, we decided to pull into a roadside motel in order to sleep away the tiresome day and get recharged for the remainder of our trip. We finally found a place with a flickering neon sign that promised “Color TV” and occupancies. Together we all cheered and pulled over, as I slipped my credit card from my tight billfold and we barreled into the large room.\n\nOnce inside we teetered like zombies until we were tight under the sheets and blankets. There was a round of kisses and one by one we drifted off to sleep. Morning came like the blink of an eye, coffee was drunk, cheese Danishes eaten and we were in the car like four little Indians back on the warpath.\n\nI have never minded a long drive, but this one seemed a tad different. I kept checking the map, and although roadside markers seemed aloof, I knew I was headed in the right direction. We’d get there eventually, I was sure of it. Yet this drive seemed to last longer than most others, and on the second day of full-on gas-guzzling combustion-engine gargling, my family began to drop off to sleep one by one like three tender raindrops falling from a cloud.\n\nAs the sun began to touch the tips of the tree tops, I looked over to my wife in the passenger seat. She sat there in suspended animation as if on a long space journey.  Her lower lip was slightly detached from her upper, leaving a moist and sexy strand of saliva between the two. My children were equally as unconscious in the back seat, a plastic sandwich bag of Gold Fish crackers between them, and their heads in opposite directions like two drunken scarecrows on an angry autumn evening.\n\nI swallowed the last of my gritty coffee as the sun fell just below the trees. The lighting in the car went from a golden yellow to moody blue in an instant. \n\nHell, I might as well drive through the night, I figured.\n\nIf I did, we could be at the cabin before the wife and kids awoke and I would be deemed king for a day—day after, actually, for I assumed I would need at least a good eight hours of restful sleep before I would be able to join my family in their cabin-by-the-lake festivities. What’s a loving husband to do if not take one for the team? I pressed down on the gas pedal as the darkened green trees beside me morphed into olive drab wallpaper.\n\nIt wasn’t long after the sun set that before me arose a conundrum. There was a fork in the road! I gazed over to my wife. She was sleeping soundly, but she was the one manning the map; the navigator, if you will. I decided to let her sleep and made a choice. I gunned the gas and swerved left.\n\nI was pretty darn sure that we were heading in the right direction. If I wasn’t I would have awoken her from her slumber. No big deal, we were still heading north. Even if I made a mistake with regards to the fork, it’d eventually work its self out, I surmised. As long as I didn’t do anything stupid like pull a U-turn, we’d be alright.\n\nI felt comfortable on this road, nothing seemed out of place. To begin with the scenery stayed mainly the same, so I reassured myself that I had made the right decision in regard to the fork. It was only after ten or so miles that I began to think that maybe I had chosen incorrectly. I saw a farmhouse out of the windshield. Usually this wouldn’t have registered, except for the fact that as I gazed upon it I began to feel chills. They crawled up my spine from my lower back to the top of my head.\n\nI cannot say what it was about the structure that frightened me, but it did. All I know is that the feeling was real, it was genuine, visceral. For a split second I saw in my mind’s eye a factory inside this farmhouse—a factory of some sort. White Formica wall tiles, stainless steel boxes that housed electronics. What? What was I thinking?\n\nI saw infants in pens…as pigs are kept. I saw filthy hoses attached to their mouths. Hoses like deteriorating garden hoses. The babies wriggled and moaned in their pens. I heard the sounds and I smelled the smells of the place as if I was standing inside it. I shook my head from side to side to dissipate these degrading images—and it worked! There was nothing there but a quaint farmhouse shroud by a dusky mist. I watched it whiz by the window as I caught my breath.\n\nMy foot squarely on the gas pedal, I stared through the windshield attempting to figure out what the heck was going on. As I did the evening gently sunk back into normalcy. I was a father and my family slumbered beside and behind me. Then night grew dramatically darker—as happens after dusk.\n \nAt that very moment a flock of birds—or bats—emerged from the darkness, swept over the hood of the car and up and over the roof like a torrent of black water. My foot pulled off the gas reflexively and I was about to plunge the breaks as the things cleared the back end of the car and continued their flight into the darkness behind me. I shook like a palm tree in a wind storm, but steadied myself, kept the car on the road and, thanked my lucky stars that a crash was averted.\n \nI was frightened, I admit it. My entire body was shaken, but I continued to drive, glancing every few seconds towards my sleeping wife in the passenger seat. I had been on the verge of waking her, but I composed myself and continued on our journey. I didn’t want to bother her. After all, she needed this vacation as much as I did. So did the kids. I wiped my forehead with the back of my hand and continued on. We all needed this vacation. This I knew for sure.\n\nI drove many untold miles, my head eventually winding down with the last of the caffeine buzz, as on I journeyed. Oh, my family would be so happy when they awoke to find themselves in front of the cabin. The night turned darker each time a cloud floated by the moon. I cracked the window to get some air. At first it was pleasant, wet, dewy, grassy, the smell of woodlands at night—delicious in its own unique way. Smells often trigger memories and I quickly remembered my many days and nights at summer camp when I was a child. My mind flickered with images of totem poles and daylong games of Color Wars. I smiled widely and chuckled out loud.\n\nWhat fun those early childhood days had been for me! I was a boy not from a quaint little town but from a teeming metropolis, and I was getting a chance to commune with nature. Wonderful, cheery, green-graced nature! It was right about then, in the midst of these great old memories, that I gazed up the road and realized I was confronted by another fork! I slowed down and again made the sole bold choice. It was soon after that my mood changed.\n\nI was immediately afraid I had made the wrong decision. The woods were definitely no longer sweet smelling and comfortable. They were turning, slowly, like a decaying corpse, into a different type of landscape. In front of my eyes I saw the land go from natural and wondrous to unfamiliar and frightening. The once sweet aroma that drifted through the cracked window changed and before long grew pungent and unbearable. The smell reminded me of rotting fruit forgotten on a kitchen table and covered in a dull fungal velvet.\n\nIn was then that my mind’s eye seemed to blink. When my eyes again registered the trees they had become dead sticks jutting from scarred and desolate hills. They then morphed into crosses, weathered man-made crosses planted for miles around me, each one waiting for a degenerate soul to be crucified upon. The moonlight shone through the once unthreatening mist creating a yellow fog that crawled between these accursed appendages. In and out of the crosses this yellow ooze undulated, like a river rotten with rancid corpses.\n\nOn I drove, like a man on a mission. Or like a junkie, a heroin junkie, who had set his sights on a ghetto street corner and the dealer who lurked there. The moon began to grow brighter and I assumed a cloud had cleared its moonlight path, yet when I looked at it through the acorn and mosquito pock-marked windshield, I saw that it had grown brighter of its own accord. I saw the moon wiggle as a distant landscape seems to do on a hazy summer day. The moon shifted in the sky slightly and on its surface I saw a silhouette. I couldn’t immediately make out the shape, but soon I saw it. I saw it clear as day: there was a face on the moon.\n\nThis was no cheery black & white Honeymooners-sitcom man in the moon. Oh no, it was a piss yellow violent and rancid face with huge blinking bloodshot eyes and a slightly upturned smile that exposed two entire rows of brittle and off-white cylindrically shaped sharp teeth. My heart almost burst from my chest cavity, it began beating so fast and hard that the steering wheel shook violently in my hands. Where was I? Who was I? No answers came, just sadness. Sadness and depression, an avalanche of misery fell down from that face upon my shoulders. I was very close to driving right off the road. \n\nThen the face noticed me! I was sure of it. It gazed down through the windshield at me, my wife and children—and began to laugh. First, it was a low giggle, before long it was a deafening roar, a guffaw. My brain was battered by the decibels of the laughing full moon—but my family didn’t flinch. They remained sleeping during the entire terrifying episode.\n\nThings didn’t get any better from there. In fact, when I looked at the road in front of me, I saw with no apparent deceit, a long and winding river of shit—a gurgling, disgusting brown fecal fjord stretching to the horizon. In the distance I could see a giant mountain with metal pipes jutting from its face, and attached to those pipes were dirty eggshell white porcelain toilet bowls, and on those toilet bowls were innumerable human beings, faces grimacing and releasing their bowels.\n\nA mountain of shit-taking almost-corpses, prisoner of war camp refugees excreting their bowels as the moon howled. It was exactly then that I felt my car turn into a prison cell. The roof lowered immeasurably, and the two side doors seemed to cave in on me. I was being crushed by the weight of the roaring metal and I knew not what to do. I felt like a death row prisoner, long-lost of poetry and fables, but praying for the sin-eating governor’s reprieve to come at any moment.\n\nThe entire night turned into a dragon’s tail, a long meandering scaly whip that thrashed at my very being. The night became a terrorist turncoat, a friend who eventually stabs my back, twisting and turning the knife’s blade in a crescendo of murder and mayhem. Where and when did it all turn bad? Where on this journey had a made a wrong turn? The forks! The forks dug into my eye sockets like rusted Swiss army knives from long forgotten childhoods. Like frogs dangling on strings by hick hooligans throwing home-made Chinese stars at them, I was now a victim of whatever fantastic phantasmagoria managed to rip through the veil.\n\nAnd the veil wasn’t merely torn; it was shred to bits.\n\nThe car began to slow even though I was stepping on the gas pedal. It was as if I was no longer in control of anything. Obviously, this was not surprising to me as I was fast slipping into crazy land. My mind was torn asunder, my reality was being sliced and diced and I was unable to stop it. I gazed out the driver’s side window and noticed the road beside me. It began to encircle the car. Not the road exactly but the dirt, the leaves, the soil, and larval creatures began to crawl from the depths of hidden holes. Giant worms and beetles, their black shiny shells reflecting the raucous moonlight emerged slowly at first, then faster. From lower levels rabid beasts ascended.\n\nThe car was encircled by these creatures, tentacles and pincers, hairy arms and bulbous eyes, and the gurgling—that damned gurgling. The foul language of whatever had encircled me was getting louder and beginning to erase my thoughts, mashing my memories one by one. It was banging, banging on the car as if I was inside a riot. It was ripping the doors off with the Jaws of Life as if I were an accident victim. It was a cacophonous roe to gain access. There was a legion of crippled midgets and armless children wriggling in the mud surrounding the vehicle. I gazed upon these monstrous visions as my family slept like comfortable logs.\n\nI clenched my eyes tight and pounded on the gas pedal. The car once again picked up speed and we traveled headlong along the ribbon of the road until another fork arose. Without contemplation I tore right and the sky blackened as the car was enveloped in a thousand flapping leathery bat wings. Through the ink-black clouds hail began to fall, cracking onto the hood of the car like stones being tossed by a Bigfoot clan.\n\nMy mind beat like the thrashing of a nail-encrusted cat-o-nine-tails on a prophet’s back, forming long deep lines of crimson on the inside of my skull cap. The flapping bat wings jelled together, quickly becoming one giant pair. They clapped closed one final time and then opened wide with a torrent of fetid rain water that splashed and gushed upon the windshield. I could no longer see a thing…\n\nLike a sheet of black silk cloth, the water dripped down the glass. As the window cleared I saw it. There in front of the car was the cottage, my friend’s summer home, the dwelling that we drove toward this entire long demented night! As the last of the water dripped from the windshield, the crack of dawn slipped from the horizon, filling the morning with a pinkish hue. We had arrived.\n\nI looked at my wife still asleep next to me. I heard her clear her throat—a wonderful human sound, seemingly innocuous but sounding to me like the opening bars of a symphony. Two birds whistled off to my right. As I turned my head to spy them, my wife rubbed her tired eyes and began to smile. I knew she had to be as famished as I was, but surprisingly she wasn’t.\n\nWhen I pointed towards the pile of fresh meat on the backseat I assumed she would be happy with the time and care I had taken with the filet knife. She was not.\n\nMaybe she’ll change her mind if I offer her a fork?\n\n\n"},"364":{"title":"You have to help. Everyone has to help. My own riddle post needs to be solved or.

It’s two thirty-two in the morning, but when you gotta go, you gotta go.  Alberto closes the bathroom door and locks it before doing his business.  Even though he’s a 29-year-old bachelor, old habits die hard.  \n\nAlberto finishes his business and is about to flush when he feels a strange pang of fear.  There’s no reason he should be scared, this is his house, all the doors and windows are locked, he’s utterly alone…there’s no REASON, he tells himself.\n\nHe looks slowly to the bathroom door, securely battened down against…well, against nothing, really.  Shrugging, he reaches towards the handle when he hears something that makes him stay his hand.  A kind of creak.  The house settling.  The wind blowing against the door.  A tree branch rubbing against the side of his house.  \n\nA footstep.  \n\nAlberto comes to his senses, realizing that he’s been standing with his hand on the toilet handle for five minutes or so.  Slowly he withdraws his hand and joins it with its sibling, absentmindedly writhing the two together like lovers.  He listens again, but all he can hear is his own heartbeat.  Not a breath of wind.  He runs to the window, but of course it’s black as pitch.  \n\nAlberto groans inwardly at himself, and grabs the toilet handle.  “If I’m going to do it, then I’ll just do it, and damn the torpedoes,” he mutters.  Flush goes the toilet and Alberto braces himself for…something, but the house remains silent, apprehensive.  Alberto laughs aloud to himself at his foolishness.\n\nAnd hears the noise again.\n\nAlberto’s laugh stops dead, but his mouth still hangs open in surprise.  His eyes widen.  “Did that sound come from the hallway?” he asks himself.  “The acoustics in this house are shit.  I can’t tell.  God.  God.  Probably not.  That’s stupid.  Stupid stupid stupid.”  He walks to the door and leans his ear against it.  The sound of his own breathing? Or…\n\n“It’s my own breathing.  Obviously.  I mean, the house is all locked up.  I’m alone in here.  No way in, right?  It was just me. \n\nObviously.”\n \nAlberto withdraws his ear.  The toilet is still gurgling as it always does after a flush.  “Since nothing is wrong, I’ll wash my hands,” he thinks.  “Yep, just wash my hands and head on back to bed.”  His hands shake as he reaches for the faucets.  But before his hands can complete their mission, he hears the faint creak again.  Unlike the other incidents, however, this creak is accompanied by the door handle to the bathroom moving.  Maybe.  Since the handle is a shiny bronze sphere, it’s really quite hard to see it moving.  It probably isn’t.\n\nAlberto locks his eyes on the door handle.  Almost imperceptibly, it moves.  \n\nAlberto freezes, staring.  Yeah, it’s moving. “The door in the wood is warping.  Hell, stranger things have happened,” whispers Alberto.  However, the water still isn’t running.  Alberto’s hands have the faucets in a death-grip.  If it had a throat, it’d be strangling.  Stupid thought.  Shakes his head.  Turns on the water.  And he hears\n\nHours later.  Alberto wakes up.  The water’s still running.  Hell of a water bill I’m racking up.  The window.  Still dark.  No watch.  Don’t know the time.  Can’t wait it out.  Stands up.  Falls.  Stands up again.  Door shut, handle stationary.  Just like normal.  Shit, I’m shaking.  I’m just cold.  The creak again, louder than ever.  Right outside the door.

Before I die,  someone must hear my story. \n\nI am a soldier from Syria. My brother died at the hands of Al-Assad’s barrel bombs. He was only thirteen. Until this time, I have been fighting. Many of my friends have died. It is very sad. \n\nFor all of the sadness, we are losing. I know we are losing. My commander does his best to keep our spirits up, but every day one of my comrades loses a limb. We pay every day for this war in fingers and ears, and even until now we are not winning. \n\nWe fight the regime, we fight Al-Nursa, we fight Al-Qaeda, we fight Da3sh. We fight each other sometimes too, if food runs low. Every day I pray to Allah that one day the fighting can be over and we can be peace again. \n\nAllah did not answer us. But around one year ago, something else did. \n\nOne day in our camp, a man came to our camp. He was a young Syrian man wearing American clothes, and nothing about him was special.  I don’t know how he managed to get to our door without the guards shooting him, but he did. He talked to us of his leader. I don’t know how to translate his name, I cannot find the word in English. The best I can do is “The Weeping Man”.\n\nWe laughed at this messenger. It is a stupid name, and we told the messenger this. He only smiled at us. This was also strange.   He said, “The Weeping Man has heard your prayers. And he will answer. Come to the police station in three days and you will receive peace. ”\n\nOf course we said no. We told him to leave our camp. He then pointed at our camp doctor, Doctor Achmed. “Come to the police station in three days, or else the Weeping Man will take his teeth”\n\nOur scout Chaled took out his gun and shot this man as soon as he finished.  He used to work at a hospital in Homs, and he fought with us for over two years.  Very little makes him afraid. He said to me, “I am not afraid of this messenger, or this Weeping Man. Let this dog to try take my teeth!”\n\nThree days passed. In the night, Dr. Achmed screamed for us. We ran and found blood all over his tent. \n\nThey were gone. All of his teeth, they were gone. \n\nHe could not speak well since his teeth were missing, so he wrote down for us what happened. In the night, a group of men came into his tent and put something in his throat to keep him from speaking. They ripped his teeth out, one a time with something of metal—I don’t know how to say in English. Doctor Achmed's teeth came out of his mouth like carrots from a garden, and they left his tent with them, making no noise. \n\nAfter this, we did as we were told and went to the police station to see the Weeping Man. Allah forgive me for this, I wish on the soul of my brother that I had not.  \n\nThat is all I can say, It takes me a long time to write in English and I cannot stay in one place for long. Please if you know of how to find assylum in America or Europe tell me how I can.

The SG Law is a code embedded in our national conventions code (in this timeline, you call it as the constitution) detailing how our society should act when it comes to matters pertaining to the subject of intradimensional, translinear, inter-universal travel.\n\nI will not disclose or tell any specific details of the law since it may cause a divergence range of 1e-20% divergence shift in the world line. However, after observing timelines after timelines shifting due entities or individuals attempting to send information about the future, there timelines have shifted so much many had even reached the divergence threshold of 1e-20% divergence shift.\n\nOne example of this is from Case No. 1022 which was a Class 4 divergence. An individual from 100 years into the future had warned his predecessor of an eminent war that was bound to happen in 10 years time in the future from that specific time point. There, he disclosed information on how the war will start and how it will be avoided. Indeed the war has been avoided. However, the individual who invented the concept that became the foundations of sending information back in time failed to be born. In addition to that, several individuals who are responsible for the technological, social and political reforms of the former timeline failed to exist in that timeline to. As a result, coupled with social problems brought by overpopulation and stagnation, the residents of that world line became extinct after a plague (which was avoided in the previous timeline due to advances made during the social reforms that took place 40 years after the war), a supervolcanic eruption and a meteor impact (which in the previous timeline has been struck by a space debris causing the asteroid to change course) struck the residents of that planet.\n\nCase No. 1022 shifted 1e-15% divergence from the original timeline.\n\nAccording to the SG Law, if one from the future would say anything about the future of that same timeline, the butterfly effect would then be activated thus changing the outcome of the world line. Every changes in the world line ranging from 1e-21 and below are divergence shifts that causes some changes in the timeline but not serious. However, world line shifts ranging from 1e-20% to 100% divergence shift, are what we call serious shifts. To give you all the idea of how much change 1e-20% divergence, imagine 2018 after Hitler became a painter, or Stalin dissolving the Soviet Union in 1945. On the other hand, for 1e-19% divergence, imagine 2018 where the Spanish Armada had successfully beaten the British Navy and Britain becomes a protectorate of Spain, or the person you know on this timeline as Genghis Khan was not born as a Mongol but as the crowned prince of the Chinese Empire.\n\nA warning to all: Never ever disclose or send any information to the past as it risks shifting the world line from one to another. It may cause a 1% divergence in the world line. According to the SG Law from Timeline No. ffhnbbjj32dn32o32655d23d_ , a world line that has diverged from the original timeline by 1%, the changes in the universe would be so great even quantum computers from 2036 would require 1 trillion trillion years to even create atleast 1 scenario for a time span of 8.457239e+50 planck time - in your concept of time, that would be ~1.4458 years (that is how long our year in our time concept is by the way).\n\nTo give you a gross estimation of how powerful our computers are, imagine all the processing power this world line has and multiply that by 1 billion and that is the processing power we are talking about here. \n\nAgain, never ever attempt to send any information back in time as it may cause a massive shift in the world line. \n\nYou have been warned.

The nearest town was 23 miles away. No cell service. We were staying at some sort of resort. The cabin we were staying in had another very close to it. It was occupied by family friends we had know for awhile. They had two kids Mikey and Risa. Risa brought a friend with. all three of them were around 15ish and i was only going into sixth grade. My three brothers(oldest to youngest Connor, Scott, Jack, me\/Griffin) and i were close. We did everything with Mikey tagging along. But one night we all decided to sneak out of the cabins at 2 a.m. and go on a \"nature walk\". The resort had a large golf course. That's what we had decided would be our journey. The night came around and we met up at the fire pit. Me, being the youngest, was scared because my brothers told of how there were serial killers in the forest. We started walking. It was dark and all we had were crummy flashlights we had found in our cabin. I was in the back of the group when it happened. It was so fast though and i was so young there was nothing i could do. There was a loud crash from the woods surrounding us and a some clank as Mikey's flashlight hit the ground. My brothers laughed and started shouting Mikey's name. They thought it was a joke 20 minutes later it wasn't so funny. MIKEY!!!! we all started screaming. I was scared so i ran off thinking i was running towards the cabin i didn't stop till i was lost. I broke down. Curled up into a ball and cried. I finally stopped and i heard something rustle by the bushes. I ran towards it thinking it was Mikey. When i got to the tree line i looked into the miles of ongoing woods. I saw someone....no someTHING. Its red eyes pursed me. It was about at the level of the bushes when our eyes met. Then it stood up. It was massive. Bigger than any bear. It stood 11 feet tall about 20 yards away.

Half of my stuff came from there. Most of the products were good quality and cheap as chips. Best of all, there was free shipping. You could get almost anything there, from makeup brushes to electronic gadgets. I especially loved shopping for cute cat t-shirts and costume jewellery. I've always had a fabulous experience shopping there, until my most recent purchase.\n\nI looked down at the aged pair of earphones I owned. The plastic earbuds were loose and nearly falling off; I had to keep clicking them back into place every so often. Rubber was beginning to peel off the cable in thin strips, exposing the wires within. I figured I had another month of use before it would stop working completely. Just long enough for a replacement to arrive. \n\nJumping on Aliexpress, I managed to find a new pair of earphones for around 5 dollars. Like I said, super cheap. It looked pretty decent from the pictures. There weren't any reviews either but I wasn't too bothered. It was only a few dollars and if it turned out to be a dud, I could just skip my Subway lunch to make up for the loss.\n\nThe next morning, I headed down for breakfast. My father was already seated at the table, drinking his usual black coffee.\n\nI greeted him with a cheery, \"Good morning!\" and sat down with some toast and a glass of orange juice.\n\n\"There's a parcel for you on the hallway table. Arrived this morning,\" Dad murmured, not glancing up from his newspaper.\n\nI paused, midway through spreading Vegemite on my toast, and ran to retrieve the parcel. It had some Chinese characters on the label. I ripped the packaging off to find a pair of earphones.\n\n\"That's pretty quick for Aliexpress,\" I thought, elated yet somewhat perplexed. In my experience, shipping usually took ages, ranging from 3 weeks to a couple of months. Definitely not _overnight_. However, who was I to complain? I examined the earphones. The design was pretty state of the art, with blue coloured chrome covering the earpieces and a long, sturdy cable. On the underside of the volume control button, there were some letters engraved in fine print. It was something foreign; \"móguǐ\" was what it said.\n\n\"Probably the fake Chinese version of Bose,\" I laughed, plugging it into my phone to test the sound quality.\n\nIt was superb. The music was crisp and clear. I could hear the bass of my song, made prominent by the earphones. It was almost like being in a live concert. I thumped my head along with the beat, immersed in the glorious music. At the same time, I was congratulating myself on managing to find such a bargain!\n\nMy father tapped me on the shoulder, indicating that we would leave in 10 minutes. He usually gave me a ride to work on his way to the office so I quickly got ready to leave.\n\nWork was long and arduous. I finally got home and showered quickly, washing the grease and smoke that had impregnated my hair during my shift spent deep-frying chips. I plugged in the earphones and settled into bed to relax to some music.\n\nI had been listening for around half an hour when the song that was playing stopped abruptly. There was silence. I checked the pause button to see if I had accidentally tapped it but the screen still showed the song as playing. So I unplugged and plugged the earphones back into my phone, figuring that was where the problem lay. The song continued as before until _it_ happened again 15 minutes later.\n\nThis time, the song was interrupted by a strange, unintelligible chanting. It was in a language I could not understand and sounded somewhat _religious_, yet ominous. At the same time, a terrified feeling settled upon my being and I felt a sudden chill in the air, causing my skin to prickle. I tore the earphones off after a minute or so; the chanting had grown louder and louder, reaching an intense, unendurable, _crescendo_.\n\n\"What was that?\" I gasped, shaking. There was a light sheen of sweat all over my arms and legs. The earphones laid on my duvet cover, cables twisted menacingly.\n\nI cut them up and threw them away. There was obviously something wrong with the earphones, I don't know what, but it was _unnatural_. I went to sleep.\n\nI woke up, tired and groggy. All I could hear in my dreams was that goddamn _chanting_, a neverending soundtrack to the empty darkness that shrouded my mind in my sleep. I went about my usual routine. I was on my way to work when I began to hear the chanting again. This time, it didn't stop.\n\nAnd it hasn't for a month. As I write this, the interminable noise has gone on for 31 days or 744 hours or... or- I don't care. All I know is that every second it grows worse. The chanting gets louder and more _evil_. I'm trying to write this down quickly as I suspect I won't be able to do very much very soon. I just want the noise to stop but it won't, I've tried everything. \n\n_Oh please, please make it stop!_\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNote:\n\nThis is Cecilia's father.

I'm lying here in my bed with Wifey and we can't sleep. We're ... we just don't know what to do with our son Dylan anymore.\n\n5 years ago, Wifey and I moved to another part of the city to start life anew. Soon after moving into our new apartment, our lives soon returned to normalcy. Even better, Wifey's health recovered and then, we found out to our delight that she was pregnant. Few months later, our first child, a son whom we named Dylan, was born.\n\n\nSince a baby, Dylan had **refused** to be held by Wifey or myself. Every time we picked him up, he would struggle, cry and scratch our faces. But he would be perfectly happy being left alone. Worse, he would reject Wifey's milk if she tried breastfeeding him. She had to resort to pumping her milk into bottles for him to drink.  This has obviously taken a toll on Wifey and I. She's more fragile emotionally than me, and some nights, I would see her sitting next to Dylan's crib crying. It is difficult for a mother to stomach the fact that her only flesh and blood is rejecting her.\n\n\nThings didn't get better as Dylan grew older. His first word wasn't mama or papa, but **No!**. At 2 when he learned to string words together, he would say things like \"Not real mommy! Not real papa. Want real daddy and mommy\". He still wouldn't let us hold him. Because we don't drive, going out is a hassle if we had to hold him. Once, Wifey almost dropped him on his head as we struggled to get out of the cab. The past 2 + years, Wifey's emotional wellbeing was being tested so badly. Both of us have grown thinner and sadder. We love our son so much. We've never laid a finger on him. Why did he hate us so?\n\n\nBut the worst thing happened just yesterday. It was Dylan's first day at preschool. We specifically told the teachers Wifey would pick him up at 4pm. When she arrived, the teachers and her realised Dylan has disappeared.\n\n\nWe were frantic. Calls we made, police was alerted. Less than an hour later, police found him wandering a block from the preschool. It really drove us crazy.\n\n\nThat evening, Wifey and I sat him down.\n\n\"Why did you run away Dylan?\" Wifey and I were perplexed.\n\n\"I want go home!\"\n\n\"You're home.\" I said gently.\n\n\"NO! Real home! With my real mommy and daddy! You're NOT my mommy and daddy!\" \n\nThat really made Wifey cry.\n\nI was exasperated and frustrated, and I shouted, the first time ever, at my son \"WE ARE YOUR REAL MOMMY AND DADDY AND YOU'RE OUR DYLAN!\"\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\nThen ... in his calmest voice ...\n\n\n\"No. My name is Christopher MacDonald. My mommy is Laura, and my daddy is Charles. I live in 57th Avenue. I have a brother Tommy.\"\n\n\n\"No...\" my wife stuttered. We were both stunned. Like the floor had just opened up and we were going to fall into it. \"Please don't say that...\"\n\n\"You kill me. You kill me!! You bang you car on me and KILL ME! Mommy cried and hold me but you and YOU just stare at me. You keep saying SORRY SORRY. NO!!! You stupid you!! I hate you!!\" Dylan started to tear.\n\n\nWifey let out a scream and ran towards the balcony. I knew what she was going to do. I knew she couldn't handle the revelation. We couldn't. I ran after her and snatched her before she climbed up the ledge and we both fell onto the floor, crying.\n\n\n\"I want to go home to my real mommy and daddy. Mommy, Daddy and Tommy miss me for so long. They must be very sad. I don't want them to be sad.

Pokémon Diamond & Jade, Chaos Black, etc. It’s amazing the frequency with which you can find them at pawnshops, Goodwill, flea markets, and such.\n\nThey’re generally fun; even if they are unplayable (which they often are), the mistranslations and poor quality make them unintentionally humorous.\n\nI’ve been able to find most of the ones that I’ve played online, but there’s one that I haven’t seen any mention of. I bought it at a flea market about five years ago.\n\n[Here](http:\/\/media.tumblr.com\/tumblr_l687r1Rn041qzpbds.jpg)’s a picture of the cartridge, in case anyone recognizes it. Unfortunately, when I moved two years ago, I lost the game, so I can’t provide you with screencaps. Sorry.\n\nThe game started with the familiar Nidorino and Gengar intro of Red and Blue version. However, the “press start” screen had been altered. Red was there, but the Pokémon did not cycle through. It also said “Black Version” under the Pokémon logo.\n\nUpon selecting “New Game”, the game started the Professor Oak speech, and it quickly became evident that the game was essentially Pokémon Red Version.\n\nAfter selecting your starter, if you looked at your Pokémon, you had in addition to Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle another Pokémon — “GHOST”.\n\nThe Pokémon was level 1. It had the sprite of the Ghosts that are encountered in Lavender Tower before obtaining the Sliph Scope. It had one attack — “Curse”. I know that there is a real move named curse, but the attack did not exist in Generation 1, so it appears it was hacked in.\n\nDefending Pokémon were unable to attack Ghost — it would only say they were too scared to move. When the move “Curse” was used in battle, the screen would cut to black. The cry of the defending Pokémon would be heard, but it was distorted, played at a much lower pitch than normal. The battle screen would then reappear, and the defending Pokémon would be gone. If used in a battle against a trainer, when the Pokéballs representing their Pokemon would appear in the corner, they would have one fewer Pokéball.\n\nThe implication was that the Pokémon died.\n\nWhat’s even stranger is that after defeating a trainer and seeing “Red received $200 for winning!”, the battle commands would appear again. If you selected “Run”, the battle would end as it normally does. You could also select Curse. If you did, upon returning to the overworld, the trainer’s sprite would be gone. After leaving and reentering the area, the spot [where] the trainer had been would be replaced with a tombstone like the ones at Lavender Tower.\n\nThe move “Curse” was not usable in all instances. It would fail against Ghost Pokémon. It would also fail if it was used against trainers that you would have to face again, such as your Rival or Giovanni. It was usable in your final battle against them, however.\n\nI figured this was the gimmick of the game, allowing you to use the previously uncapturable Ghosts. And because Curse made the game so easy, I essentially used it throughout the whole adventure.\n\nThe game changed quite a bit after defeating the Elite Four. After viewing the Hall of Fame, which consisted of Ghost and a couple of very under leveled Pokémon, the screen cut to black. A box appeared with the words “Many years later…” It then cut to Lavender Tower. An old man was standing, looking at tombstones. You then realized this man was your character.\n\nThe man moved at only half of your normal walking speed. You no longer had any Pokémon with you, not even Ghost, who up to this point had been impossible to remove from your party through depositing in the PC. The overworld was entirely empty — there were no people at all. There were still the tombstones of the trainers that you used Curse on, however.\n\n \n\nYou could go pretty much anywhere in the overworld at this point, though your movement was limited by the fact that you had no Pokémon to use HMs. And regardless of where you went, the music of Lavender Town continued on an infinite loop. After wandering for a while, I found that if you go through Diglett’s Cave, one of the cuttable bushes that normally blocks the path on the other side is no longer there, allowing you to advance and return to Pallet Town.\n\nUpon entering your house and going to the exact tile where you start the game, the screen would cut to black.\n\nThen a sprite of a Caterpie appeared. It was the replaced by a Weedle, and then a Pidgey. I soon realized, as the Pokémon progressed from Rattata to Blastoise, that these were all of the Pokémon that I had used Curse on.\n\nAfter the end of my Rival’s team, a Youngster appeared, and then a Bug Catcher. These were the trainers I had Cursed.\n\nThroughout the sequence, the Lavender Town music was playing, but it was slowly decreasing in pitch. By the time your Rival appeared on screen, it was little more than a demonic rumble.\n\nAnother cut to black. A few moments later, the battle screen suddenly appeared — your trainer sprite was now that of an old man, the same one as the one who teaches you how to catch Pokémon in Viridian City.\n\nGhost appeared on the other side, along with the words “GHOST wants to fight!”.\n\nYou couldn’t use items, and you had no Pokémon. If you tried to run, you couldn’t escape. The only option was “FIGHT”.\n\nUsing fight would immediately cause you to use Struggle, which didn’t affect Ghost but did chip off a bit of your own HP. When it was Ghost’s turn to attack, it would simply say “…” Eventually, when your HP reached a critical point, Ghost would finally use Curse.\n\nThe screen cut to black a final time.\n\nRegardless of the buttons you pressed, you were permanently stuck in this black screen. At this point, the only thing you could do was turn the Game Boy off. When you played again, “NEW GAME” was the only option — the game had erased the file.\n\nI played through this hacked game many, many times, and every time the game ended with this sequence. Several times I didn’t use Ghost at all, though he was impossible to remove from the party. In these cases, it did not show any Pokémon or trainers and simply cut to the climactic “battle with Ghost.\n\nI’m not sure what the motives were behind the creator of this hack. It wasn’t widely distributed, so it was presumably not for monetary gain. It was very well done for a bootleg.\n\nIt seems he was trying to convey a message; though it seems I am the sole receiver of this message. I’m not entirely sure what it was — the inevitability of death? The pointlessness of it? Perhaps he was simply trying to morbidly inject death and darkness into a children’s game. Regardless, this children’s game has made me think, and it has made me cry."},"378":{"title":"The Twitchy Kid working Drive Thru","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/4t9k2s\/the_twitchy_kid_working_drive_thru\/","flair":null,"author":"wholychao","selftext":"Ok. I think I can tell this in one go.\n\nThis happened a while a go. I've been trying to decide if I'd actually take the time to try and describe it to you. But I've got to get it out.\n\nIt was at the burger joint. I'm not sure I should say the name of the franchise. They've got nothing to do with it. Great food. Everyone should go there, it just happened to happen there.\n\nI was going out to lunch with my buddy Biron. Obviously, not his actual name. I was on lunch break from work and he didn't work. We go to this burger place all the time. A whole crew of us do, it's kinda was the only thing we all had in common. We were that midnight parking lot crew.\n\nBiron called us the Burger Knights. He called us that after the first time we did it. And we'd done it a lot once we got started. No, it's not what you think. I've got to ease into these things better. I mean, we got people fired.\n\nEver been to a burger place when they're training new staff? Don't. If you see some kid spilling oil or looking around like a lemming for leadership or you see the greasy smoke of a poorly managed grill you should run away. It will suck. I assure you. The kitchen crew are generally too busy keeping this whelpling from cutting his own thumbs off to do their own fucking work and the quality of the food goes straight down the toilet.\n\nTo Biron this was unacceptable.\n\nThis new guy was really screwing things up at our burger place. So, Biron got a few of us together, the core of the Burger Knights, and we went on the first war path. There were four of us. Me, Biron, Rusty and Boner.\n\nThe problem kid was working the drive through register. For those of you who don't know, in a kitchen crew there will usually be three or four people listening in to the chatter on the drive thru order box. The only one you talk to is whoever is working the register. But you can bet a manager babysitting the fries is listening and making fun of you viciously in hopes of impressing the girl working the grill, who is also listening.\n\nWe roll up and start giving an order to the kid. Then change the order after he repeats it. Only slightly changed, so it could be a mistake. Then keep changing the order and keep getting angrier, and louder. Trying not to laugh as we do. Finally Biron yells, \"If you can't understand English I'll just spend my money somewhere that can!\" And lays rubber down as we exit the drive thru.\n\nTwo days later we go back and the kid is gone. Biron asked the manager, just to be sure. But yeah, the kid got shitcanned. Biron was elated. That night he got a thirty rack of pebber opened his trunk in middle of the strip mall parking lot and the Knights celebrated for the first time.\n\nI was thinking about the rest of the times, but what matters is what happed... I almost said yesterday, but it's been almost a week. Damn it. I still haven't heard anything else or from anyone else. The place is still closed. It looks like they've cleaned up this inside, but. But I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nSo, screwing up drive thru orders worked for a while, but not forever. We had to get more creative. Boner created the Pink Shake Trick. That's where he'd demands a pink shake. This place has vanilla and chocolate shakes. Really, really thick ones. But Boner would demand a Pink Shake and once he felt sure the counter guy understood what he was demanding he would drive up to the window and wait. Just sit there and wait. And if anyone would ask he'd just keep demanding a Pink Shake.\n\nSix times out of seven, it would end with the counter guy insisting that such a thing didn't exist. Boner call the 800 number listed on all the receipts and tell them that the kid was refusing to provide for a simple request. Corporate never asks too many questions. Most Big companies are 'shoot first, ask questions never' from the top down. The kid was gone inside of a week. I mean, not as elegant as some of the tricks, but it did work.\n\nOh, and that seventh time. The kid actually made a god'amn pink shake. Boner was stupefied for a second. Sitting there looking at the pink milkshake in his hand. Then he threw the shake at the window and told the kid he wanted green. The shake exploded everywhere. I think some was even dripping down from inside the glass.\n\nIt even splashed back on Boner. He licked his hand as we drove away. He eyes tighten up a little and he says, \"I think that kid mixed BBQ sauce into the shake. It's actually pretty fuckin good!\"\n\nWe laughed about that one for the rest of the night.\n\nSo, about a week ago, when I'm out at lunch with Biron it goes bad from the moment we roll up on the order box. The kid is awkward and stilted when he talks over the speaker. Says he can't hear us half the time, and we're not even messing with the kid at this point. Either he just can't hear or hasn't figured out how to wear the headset. Then, when we get to the window, he's stumbling around looking for his co-workers, cuz he doesn't know what to do. You may not have picked up on this little detail, but Biron did. Kid was all alone on headset. If he's looking for his co-workers, that means they're off com and have left him in the weeds.\n\nThis kid was a goner. I almost felt bad. Mostly, because I could see in Biron's eyes that he had tasted blood. Biron says to me, \"Call the Knights. We're going on Warpath tonight.\"\n\nOh, had I mentioned he'd started calling it Warpath by that point. I mean, I don't think he knew anything like this might happen. He's just a dramatic guy. I reminded him that I was still on the clock, but he wanted to get started with whoever could make it right now. \"Just look at this kid,\" Biron spit, \"This can't wait.\" At the time, I actually agreed with him.\n\nOnce we finally got our food I put out a text to see who was around. There were a few responses by the time he dropped me off at my job. He told me to get over to the parking lot as soon as I could so I could join up with them. As he's driving off he shouts back at me, \"Bring a thirty rack!\"\n\nThe parking lot was less that a half mile from the burger place, so we kept all our cars there and would pack up into one car at a time to fuck with the kid. When I got to the parking lot there were six cars there and two people sitting around listening to music. It was just after dark and Biron had been fucking with this kid all day.\n\nI sat and shot the shit with the two guys there, low level kids who had just made it to a few gatherings but hadn't been on Warpath yet. They were excited. What can I say, there's not much to do in a bigish little city in the middle of fucking nowhere.\n\nSoon enough, the car comes rolling back through. Boner is driving and Biron is whooping like a madman in the backseat.\n\nHe jumps out of the car and sees me. He trows up his hands and runs at me shouting, \"Eight!\", then he grabs my shoulders and continues, \"Six out of eight!\" and laughs. I start laughing too. This kid has actually made a pink shake! This is going to be an epic night. At least, that's what I thought at the time.\n\nWe all piled into Biron's car to make another run at the burger place. I'm in the backseat, center. And Biron is shouting back at me as he navigates the three tight corners between the parking lot and the burger joint. Apparently, this kid looks like he's just about to have a psychotic break. And we're about to watch Biron to his Triple Burger bit.\n\nIt's a lot like the original bit, but Biron orders three burgers then specifies a super complicated toppings request and tells the counter kid that all three burgers should be the same. The kid confirms the order, then Biron starts another different topping request. The kid is confused, which makes sense. Biron explains that it's a simple order of three burgers and gives an entirely new topping request.\n\nThe guys are having a really hard time holding it in at this point, but we know if we laugh this kid might realize what's going on, so everyone holds it in while Biron tells the poor kid he just wants one burger with triple patties. There is long drawn out moan of agonizing death ended with a brief attack of hyperventilation. Biron just shouts \"Triple Burger, make it happen.\" And pulls up to the window.\n\nRusty is in the front seat and he starts laughing. \"Dude, look! They haven't cleaned up the Pink Shake.\" He shuts up quick, but we can all see the pink stain dripping down the glass. He's right. It's hilarious. We're all wondering what this kid is going to give Biron, but we all know what ever it is it's going to be wrong. Kid hands him the bag saying, \"Here you go, three triple burgers. That'll be $16.66\"\n\nBiron starts trowing burgers back at the kid and yelling. \"I only asked for one burger, asshole!\" Poor kid is trying to dodge sloppy incoming burgers that are fragmenting on him while Biron keeps yelling, \"I'm not paying for these, and I'm not paying for this one!\" opening the last burger and taking a massive bite out of it before speeding away.\n\nI think the kid was actually twitching before I lost sight of him through the back windows. The last thing I noticed was a tomato slice that had been stuck to his face falling to the floor. Fucking kid.\n\nWe turned the one way onto the parkway and veered off back towards the parking lot we were all whooping it up. These was the best night I'd ever seen and it was only the first run I'd been on. I didn't know, I would have stopped.\n\nRusty had come up with a new trick and we were going to run it next. It was Rusty's bit, so we all piled into Rusty's car. Everyone wanted to know what it was, but outside of clearing it with Biron, he just said he wanted it to be a surprise. Biron wasn't going to say anything either, but he was grinning from ear to ear.\n\nWe got to the burger joint and Rusty pulls into a parking spot behind the order box. If your having trouble picturing it, it's like a big u-loop, with a few parking spots in the middle of the 'u' - to not waste space, I guess. Rusty shuts off the engine, and we all want to know what's going on. But he just waits, listening to the radio till the song is done. Then he tells us something I'd known but hadn't thought much about. \"You know those order boxes are always listening, even if there's no one there.\" I'm still confused, all of us in the back seat at least. Biron is just grinning in the front.\n\nRusty jumps out of the car and walks up to the side of the menu board, just outside of the security camera. Don't ask how we knew where the cameras are pointed. He's just standing there. Then Biron rolls down his window and we can hear Rusty talking. Just barely.\n\n\"They all want you to go,\" He's saying, \"Think about it. They've got it out for you. They want you gone. Where are they. Are they watching you. Is somebody watching you. Why are you even here. You should do it. Just do it. Why don't you. You know they're out to get you. It's only a matter of time. They deserve it. Do it. It's the only way.\"\n\nAnd he's just going on and on. Fucking amazing. I don't know where this kid comes up with this shit, but it's amazing. They guys are all on the edge of conniption fits trying to hold down the laughter. This is the most epic night of Warpath ever. I mean, there's no way this kid can take it. Fuck.\n\nAfter about twenty minutes, Rusty gets back in the car and we drive back to the parking lot and crack open the thirty rack. Then... I guess we forgot about the kid. We started telling war stories about the best runs we'd done before. And hour turned into two or three, and the next thing you know it's really, really late.\n\nBiron decides he wants to roll past the drive thru one last time. They're closed, but not by a lot. There's a good chance we'll get a chance to see the kid mopping up the kitchen, and for some reason Biron really liked watching that. I guess it made him feel superior, or victorious. I could never really work out what kinds of feelings Biron was having. But I didn't care, I wanted to go too.\n\nA few people went home, so there were only three of us on that last drive by. We rolled up slow on the order box. Suddenly we all lurched forward. Biron had slammed on the breaks. We all knew why, we all heard it. The second we were at the order box it started talking. He started talking. \"Please drive thru. Nobody can help you now. They're all gone.\" Nobody said anything, but the kid just kept repeating \"Please drive thru. They're all gone.\" over and over. Even as we pulled up he kept repeating over and over again.\n\nThe window was closed. The kid was sitting there staring out the window. Not at us, I don't think he was actually looking at anything. He would twitch occasionally. We couldn't hear the order box speaker and like I said, the window was closed. But his lips were moving and I think he was just repeating the same things. The somebody shouted \"Drive!\"\n\nThe car didn't go anywhere. And the scene in the kitchen was starting to come into focus. It looked like there was fry smoke thick in the air. The night manager was bent over into the fryolator. The oil boiling over where his face went in. The voice shouted again, \"Drive!\" I think it might have been my voice.\n\nOn the floor by the front counter I could just barely see the body of the grill girl. I could only tell by her hair. Her face was mostly gone. Her fingers were gone and blood pooled around her hands. She was dead. I mean, I don't know, but I wish for her that she was dead.\n\nThen the window opened and the kid turned his blood spattered face towards us and said \"Drive.\" Biron screamed and the car lurched forward.\n\nWe didn't say anything on the way back to the parking lot. There was nothing to say. We all got into our cars and drove away. I didn't sleep at all that night. I thought about writing it down for you. I tried, but I just couldn't.\n\nThe next day I drove past the burger joint on my way into work. There were cop cars in the parking lot and the doors were block off with police tape. There was nothing in the newspapers. There are a lot of people wondering what happened. Three of us know for sure. But none of us have said anything. I haven't heard from Biron since that night. I haven't been back to the parking lot since. I really have no idea what to do. I haven't been able to sleep since that night. Maybe I can sleep now. I'm going to try.\n"},"379":{"title":"I love my sister!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/8o7bzx\/i_love_my_sister\/","flair":null,"author":"saltshaker78","selftext":"My name is jimmy, I live with my sister after my mom and dad got a divorce.

I didn't notice I had something like this until I rented out my very own apartment. The apartment was cockroach infested and had bugs crawling everywhere. Cockroaches were all over the bed, all over my tooth brush, & all over my clothes. I never really liked any of the bugs but because the rent was dirt cheap, I couldn't really complain. \n\nI noticed my fetish when I was lying down in bed. I just got out of the shower so I was naked. All of the sudden, A cockroach crawled onto my testicles. At first I screamed in fear but then the roach started to crawl up my shaft. That's when the sensation appeared, I didn't really complain so I grabbed the roach and started to rub it against the tip. The roach felt great as it slid from the bottom of the shaft to the tip of my penis. I started to gather around bugs from my house and contain them in a small jar. After I gathered many cockroaches in a jar, I lied down on my bed again and took the jar in my hands. I then took off the lid and put the jar upside down above my member. The cockroaches then infested my penis. There were more than 4 cockroaches all over my testicles. They weren't small but they were medium size cockroaches.\n\nAfter I started taking more notice of my fetish, I realized I wanted more than just small cockroaches. I talked to an old friend I knew about something like this. We called him one eyed Fred, I don't know why though; both of his eyes were still intact. One eyed Fred was the type of person you went to if you needed help with just about anything. He was there to supply your drug needs and your exotic import needs as well. When I told him about my fetish, Fred took it very lightly. He said that he didn't find anything wrong with my fetish and that he seen many other fetish cases like mine. He was happy to help. When he told me about the cockroaches he could provide, I got really happy. He said he could provide Madagascar cockroaches for my fetish needs. At first I found it to be bullshit, I mean those things are huge; I didn't really believe he could provide them to me.\n\nThe next day I paid a visit to one eye Fred and found him holding a large box in his arms. The thing was so huge and it looked like it was really heavy for Fred. I walked up to him and asked if that's the cockroaches and Fred responded, \"No that's the box, the cockroaches are inside.\" Fred wasn't really bright but he did have contacts and that's why I needed him. I paid him what I had on me for the box. He charged me a fortune, over $200 for these little sexy critters.\n\nI brought them home and I prepared myself for the cockroaches. If you don't know what they look like, here's a picture [Madagascar cockroaches](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/BXu0Oun.jpg)\n\nI lied down on my bed and covered my member with lube. I wanted to make sure I was going to have the healthiest session because I heard that lube increases pleasure. I realized these cockroaches probably weren't clean so I took hand sanitizer and began rubbing it on my shlong. I didn't know much about these cockroaches so I was prepared for the best experience ever. I held the jar above my shlong and I flipped it upside down. Instead of the cockroaches falling out, they crawled out from the side of the jar. They then crawled onto my hands and then crawled down my arms. They made their journey up my chest and a one started to crawl into my mouth. The other started to crawl into my eyes. I grabbed the one on my eyes and set him on my dick but he didn't take kindly to that and started digging his way down my shlong. It hurt like hell, I was screaming pretty hard but I realized while I was screaming, one of the cockroaches was laying behind my cheekbone trying to make its way down my throat. I felt like I was being gagged and I loved it. \n\nWhen the other cockroach was digging down on my dick, it started to make its way down my hole. It started to dig a bigger hole and then began to crawl down. I was screaming but I didn't stop it. Someplace deep in my heart, there was a voice telling me this is where I belonged. This was the life I so desperately wanted to live and now there was no more judgment but only trial and error as I committed to the idea of being fucked by cockroaches. It was done, the cockroach was already half way inside my shlong and I didn't know if it was alive. I could just see an antenna sticking out from the tip. My penis looked very deformed at this point. It didn't have a straight shape anymore.\n\nHappiness, just happiness.\n"},"381":{"title":"Goodbye Friend","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/ry5l3\/goodbye_friend\/","flair":null,"author":"Sithlord0100","selftext":"As a college student, I work side jobs. One of the side jobs i worked was for a friend of mine, babysitting his two kids. I will never baby sit again. The kids were good, but my friend died while i was watching them. This was sad and all but it's what happened the next day that freaked me out. I have slept with a light on ever since.\nThe day after my friend died, my parents left for a camping trip. This left me and my dog home alone to figure out how to cope with everything. This meant throwing the biggest party i could. The party went well that night, everyone had fun and once things were over people started leaving. As usual i was stuck with clean up duty, as somehow everyone had work the next day. After cleaning up the mess and throwing all the beer bottles and handles away, i locked up the house and got ready to go to bed. I double checked the doors, and even dead bolted and chained the front door. Crawling into bed, i always sleep with my dog next to me. Tonight he seemed a little jumpy and agitated. I figured this was due to the party and the amount of people who were around. I ignored him and slowly approached sleep. As i was about to fall asleep the dog freaks out and i hear the distinct sounds of light switches flicking on and both the front door flying open as well as the back door. As it is when my parents are gone, i sleep with a shotgun next to my bed. Thinking that I was about to be robbed I prepared for the worse. I searched the house room to room, shotgun in hand, ready for anything. The only thing i found strange or out of place was how cold the house had become. Otherwise nothing else was weird. The doors had opened by themselves and all, and i mean all, the lights in the house were on. I knew i had locked up and there was no way someone had gotten in because the screen doors and garage door were still locked. I think my friend who i had lost the day before may have been playing a trick on me for not inviting him to the party. This experience has freaked me out and made me a believer in the supernatural ever since. He still visits me in different ways and forms but nothing as extreme as that night."},"382":{"title":"The Video.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3cwavp\/the_video\/","flair":null,"author":"None","selftext":"I use YouTube pretty much whenever I get the chance. I am pretty much a fanatic. Although I will say that Dailymotion is better, it's an animalistic reflex to go to YouTube. I had been bored with my subscriptions lately and I had wanted something different. I was thinking along the lines of someone going into a haunted house and getting spooked. I was getting sleepy though and I felt it was best to wait until later to view that stuff or I'd be seeing it in my dreams. It's not uncommon for something like that to happen. Before sleeping, I made and ate a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and played some Minecraft for a half hour. I felt ready to sleep then.\n\nWhen I woke up, my stomach was in a bit of pain from going to sleep right after eating. I should've waited another 15 minutes, used the extra minutes to finish up my carrot farm in Minecraft. I felt it was not necessary though, But I took a tums and went about my day. I got on my computer and talked to my girlfriend on Skype, I asked her how she was doing and she said that she was doing fine and that she was watching this new YouTuber. I asked her about YouTuber, you know, what are his videos, what is he like. When I asked she just giggled like I was kidding around. I asked again and she said; \"He's a little intense for your tastes.\"\n\nGod damn it, she shouldn't have said that. She sent my curiousity into overdrive. She had later emailed me the YouTuber's account. I didn't want to get to it right away so I watched some other videos. But something was odd, I checked my subscriptions and I found a video. \"If you encounter this, throw your computer into a dumpster.\" I didn't understand what that could've meant. The video explained about how there is a new YouTube channel that is very very disturbing, as there are instances of blood, gore, the usual. But it's not faked, it is very grotesque and realistic. Plus, you cannot exit the browser until you watch 3 videos from the channel. I was interested for a second but I didn't really want to see. I had went about my day, watching some Rob Dyke, I Hate Everything, and SomeOrdinaryGamers.\n\nI was about to shut my computer down for the rest of the day and take a nap but I still hadn't seen that channel my girlfriend sent to me. I went ahead and checked it and there it was, the link and a playlist of every video the channel has to offer. I went to the channel and... Oh shit, this was the  YouTube channel I watched about, I tried exiting my browser but as you'd expect, I couldn't close it. It's like it locked the close button. The browser full screened. I was screwed, no shit about that. I was trapped for a while. I clicked on one video. \"carrie\"\n\nI won't unsee what I've seen. It was a 22 minute video. The first minute was a message saying;\n\n\"You cannot exit the browser, and leaving your computer for more than 12 seconds is a death wish. You will die if you try to not watch this video. You must watch it, or else. This is joy my friend, true joy. You will experience the reason people were made today.\"\n\nI will explain this video in as much detail as I can, so if you have an uneasy stomach, go away.\n\nThe video begins with the cameraman putting the camera on a tripod, and a girl is seen on a chair, strapped down. \"Tell us what your name is little girl\" The cameraman says. \"Come on, don't be shy.\" The girl begins to cry, and I seemingly wonder why. It didn't take me too long to figure out why though. The blank, white room with plastic on the floor, the girl tied up to a chair. You figure the rest, she was getting murdered. \"TALK TO ME!\" The cameraman says in an almost demonic way. The girl begins talking. \"Ca--Carr--Carrie\" The girl is beginning to sweat, cry, and starts struggling. I can't stand to watch, but I know if I stop watching, I may end up like this girl.\n\nThe cameraman goes right up to the camera, and says \"This is what I feel the joy of creation is.\" He takes his balisong and spins it in the girls face. The cameraman \"accidently\" throws his balisong into the girls left eyeball. Blood pouring out, the girl screaming bloody murder, screaming I have never heard before or have ever wanted to hear. The cameraman takes the knife out of the eyeball, forcing it out of it's socket, and I see the optical vein connected to the skull about to be cut out. The cameraman cuts the vein, making the eyeball fall to the floor, then the cameraman goes to the girl and begins cutting into her breasts, taking the shirt and bra off to get a better look, cutting a \"C\" into the right breast. Then proceeding to stab in alot of other areas. The video didn't end until the girl had no more life in sight. I was glad when the video was over, but I was horrified.\n\nI then get a popup on my computer. \"Only 2 more to go.\"\n\nI WANT THIS TO FUCKING END! SOMEONE, GET ME OUT! Ok ok... I can POSSIBLY make it through this. I saw a 3 minute video and thought that might be a quickpass. It was a tutorial on how to cook a victim. There are actually 152 ways. How the fuck is this even possible? How is YouTube not even checking up on this? No local authorities involved? How the fuck?! Anyway, I only had one more video to watch. It was an hour long video, a documentary. I decided to start it, the documentary was on what to do if a victim possesses any of your belongings in an act of vengeance.\n\nI only got through the video half-way through before I fell asleep. This guy Freddy-Kruger'd my ass! He grabbed me while I was asleep and was about to start murdering me when I grabbed his hand and began twisting it. He deserves it for being such a sadistic fuck. He started laughing at me. \"Kid, this is life! People die and get hurt. I might as well give both at once.\" He's still giggling away like a school-girl. \"Go to hell.\" I tell him, and he then slams my head into the keyboard.\n\nI start running whenever I get my vision back and I run into my 8 year old brothers room. Bad bad mistake, he then goes into there and sees the kid. He grabs my brother and points a revolver to his head.\n\n\"It's either you or him.\" The sadistic fuck told me. I... I...\n\n\"Kill me first so I don't have to watch him die.\" I'd rather the both of us dead and appease this shithead, but I want to die first. \"Nah, I'll just kill him and leave you in horrible mental pain for the rest of your life.\"\n\nHe shoots my brother, and he figuratively shoots me in the stomach. He walks off like nothing ever happened with a grin on his face.\n\nFuck YouTube."},"383":{"title":"Aliens invaded my school and are now killing everyone in some sick games.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/2x31q2\/aliens_invaded_my_school_and_are_now_killing\/","flair":"Series","author":"Negieren","selftext":"Have you thought that you knew enough about the world?

An alien!\"\n\nEtc, etc..\n\nIt stood up energetically and told us about a \"game\" that we've participated in, just by being at school.\n\n*I didn't sign up for this shit..*\n\nSuddenly, there were various weapons around our desk, some got gun, some got sword, some got a pencil..there were many things around the desk at that time.\n\n\"Alright let me explain the situation!\" It said in a squeaky voice.\n\"You've all participated in our annual game, the **Survival game.**\n\n\"Until one remains, the game won't end, there are 20 students in this class..which is class..11B. Students from grade 1A until University are forced to participate in this competition!\n\n\"As long as you're alive, I'll have to conceal your identity! And you no longer can be in public until one remains!\"\n\nEveryone started to panic, we all couldn't believe what's happening, one of the boys from the back shot the creature.\n\n\"Don't worry! I've got this I've played Dead Space!\"\n\nRobert shot the thing, but then we noticed something wrong..\n\n*It fucking stopped a bullet with its fucking eyelashes, it then reiterated the bullet and it pierced right through his heart..damn it Robert..you were always so bold..sooner or later, he turned into liquid, it was very fucking disgusting like he turned into Robert milkshake?*\n\nAll of his organs dissolved, creating a big mess, no sooner his body evaporated leaving no traces of him, but his clothes and his weapons.\n\nThe small thing kept smiling, it looked like a Celebi from Pokémon, if it wasn't for its childishly big eyelashes..and flamboyant appearance, it started to explain the rules.\n\n\"Well, it's pretty simple, no abusing the authorities! :( \" When it said it it actually made that face, as if it can change its face into an emoji.\n\n\"No touching other people's..\" Before he could finish the sentence, a girl quickly weighed herself down, I do not know her name but she's the nerdy girl, wore glasses..pony tails.. Typical. She held the gun and before she got to shoot, her hands dissolved before my very eyes, the solid bones of hers soon turned into nothing but slimes, I could see the flesh and skin of hers merging slowly burning and steaming, it was all to graphic, so she just was on the floor, crying and limbless.\n\n\"No touching other people's weapon <3!\" It changed its face into a smiley.\n\nThen the face of that thing changed.\"**ONE OF YOU MOTHERFUCKERS IS THE WOLF, FUCKING KILL THE WOLF BEFORE YOU GET KILLED YOURSELF, THAT'S THE GAME MOTHERFUCKER!**\" \n\nIt's face suddenly turned red and it frowned it shouted so loud, it turned Samatha deaf again, breaking her hearing aids..\n\nSamantha screamed very loudly, Alicia went there quickly over there and gave Samantha a hug, only to dissolve into a puddle. \n\n*what was happening.*\n\nA minute ago Samantha was my dream girl, now she is something I want to avoid, she quickly adverted her self from death but it was too late, she tightly hugged Samantha, but Samantha was wearing a flak jacket, the rule was to not touch other people's weapon, her entire body touched it, slowly she dissolved, I could see blood dripping about, that pulled her skin, flesh, blood everything of hers it all looked like a messy mess, like marshmallows when heated for too long.\n\nShe kept muttering, but it was useless with her mouth like that..probably around 2 feet tall..gross...Samantha looked at her with terrified eyes and cried running to me and in the process stepped on Alicia's skull, crushing everything that's left of her, she was shaking.\n\n\"Zts..sts..ze,.tsa..\" I no longer liked her, she looked like a fucking retard..\n\n-x-x-\n\nThe little alien went through the door and exited, the door closed automatically.\n\nThe first thing we did was to open the door, it wouldn't budge.\n\nIn just a few moment, we looked at each other, there are 18 students left, no sooner it turned into hell, everyone was killing each other, pencils were used to draw lines everywhere, anyone who dared to touch it got there legs dissolved.\n\nThrowing rubber bands at each other..what I heard was more unpleant.\n\n\"SORRY, SORRY I AM SO SORRY, UGHHHWAA STOP SHOOTING YOU MOTHR-\"\nNever have I heard Sesi, talk such a way, she has a kind heart.\n\n\"HAHAHA THIS IS LIKE ROBLOX, IM GOING TO KILL YOU NOOBS TAKE THIS, TAKE THAT..\"\n\nThat sounded like the no lifer, Jull.\n\n\"Nyaaaaaa! Stop it, it hurts, it hurts, *It hurts,* **IT FUCKING HURTS!**\"\nIt's Ioep , the candy eye of the class.\n\n\"Don't kill me no.., I'm your friend, stop look..do you want money..hey stop..\"\n\nThe cranky voice was similar, \nI looked up to see Max, he was right next to ****1, our top student, he shoved his pistol next to his face and pulled the trigger, now Max looked like some horrible monster you see in your dreams, jaws wide open..I don't know..but, I've seen stuff way worse on the Internet, so that means I'm Pretty safe, right?\n\nPaper airplanes were the fatalist, once touch and you completely dissolve, people even used straws and spat at other, dissolving their face, it was horrible, people stabbing each other, losing there limbs, it was chaos no one could've stopped them, I luckily hid behind the desk with Samantha, my weapon was a sword, so I had some confidence, then we heard footsteps towards us, a guy bent down and looked at us, it terrified us, then we realised he was headless.\n\nIt roll over to Samantha, but she didn't react, she closed her eyes, she had to be the quietest person around here, I've seen many bad stuff from the Internet, but nothing can beat the horror of this game, my heart was beating, nor did I remember a moment without sweating,\n\nIn the end it seemed only one survived, it was \"****1\"\n\nThere's something about that guy that I just can't touch..he asked us both to come, I held Samantha's eyes, I didn't want her to see..well just imagine dismembered bodies everywhere around your classroom..heads and bodies of classmates you know, the only one survived was ****1 and the girl from earlier, you know the nerdy one with pony tails, I thought she looked hilariously stereotypical, apparently, she survived by pretending to be dead.\n\nSo ***1 finally spoke, \"one of us here is the \"Wolf\" the thing was talking about.\"\n\nThen I asked him, \"How do we know?\"\n\nHe them held the gun Robert wore, it surprised me when his hand didn't dissolve, he pointed at the girl and so then, she started to crawl her way out of it, it was pointless, I couldn't save her the floor was full of lines and weapons, I'm afraid of losing a limb.\n\nWithout hesitation ; he killed her.\n\n\"Turns out she isn't the one.\"\n\nI didn't speak a single word, I didn't knew her long enough to care, but the way he treats her gives me a picture of what might happen to me.\n\nHe then looked at me, Iz was thinking of moving away, just then he threw heaps of marbles around me, I quickly climbed over the desk and pulled Samantha.\n\nHe took out his gloves then took out a coin from his sleeves.\n\nHe called me \"Heads.\" And he called Samantha \"Tails.\" \nIs he mad? Is he crazy? What's he thinking..I don't want to die..\n\nHe flipped it, while he flipped it, I quickly threw a sword at him, it missed him and instead knocked over his coin, it lands on **Tails.**\n\nBefore I could go ahead and save Samantha, he shot her in the head with perfect accuracy, he withdrawn his gun faster than I could think.\n\nEverything disappeared.\n\nNo really, everything disappeared, no signs of corpse, no signs of blood or weapons, it was just me and ***1..\n\n\"Congratulations you completed level 1! Please proceed to the next room.\"\n\nThe door was opened, ****1 and I went through the door, just as we entered.\n\nI could swear I was inside a spaceship, all I saw was a place full of staircases, corridors etc..\n\n-x-x-\n\n\n**11-A = 3, 11-B= 4, 11-C= 2 11-D= 1.**\n\nAs of now, I'm writing this through a laptop they gave, I think I may be in a spaceship, I'm not in for anal probing, I tried to communicate with my mother, but they seem to have no recollection of me and she blocked me, same goes with anyone else.\n\nBefore the next game starts, I guess I should tell you about how the others felt, I myself am somewhat of a stoic, although it striked fear in me, I didn't really care for most of them, I didn't really care much..but ****1 was probably the real stoic, he never has shown any facial expression.\n\nJust behind us ****twin 1 and twin 2 came, they were always despised, can't blame the others though, I too myself bear hatred for them, they didn't seem to show any reaction.\n\nFrom 11-A= Came three people, ****Nerd, he is a neurotic person and so very..self centred, he seems to be shaking.\n\n****2, I met her this morning, she and I have not really talked much, but I could swear she was staring at me at the train, she is always trembling, she is covered in blood..so..\n\n****|, ****| is a tomboy, despite being a girl she's always so pushy, but she is stronger than most people I know so..she seems to be visibly sad though.\n\nFrom 11-C= Came, ****£ A rich boy, I don't know much about him other than the fact he's loaded, he is unconscious.\n\n****||, ****|'s boyfriend..he's a real fucked up kid and a bully, he's a shorty but he's good at basketball, he's caring £, he seems to be very solemn.\n\nAnd the last and also the most memorable one..****Awesome, I think he's the strongest guy in this school..he killed police officers once when he was in grade school, he would often fight against a pack alone, he is notable for his strength and his urge to kill..\n\nHe was pretty much naked except for his boxers, he was smiling, he wasn't faking it, he was laughing as well, his face was shrouded in mystery, how could someone just laugh at this situation?\n\n\"Hey ||, we gotta get out of here..where are we?\"\n\n\"I don't know Hun..but everything's going to be alright, Kay?\"\n\n\"You don't know that..we're going to fucking die..leave that loser..\"\n\nJust then | grabbed one of the androids passing by, the androids looked exactly like the entity that greeted us earlier.\n\nShe pulled it and exclaimed, \"Where's the fucking bathroom?\"\n\nIt replied,\"Ma'm the next game is about to start, after that you may rest, it is not advisable to leave the game, however, if you do wish so then it's  that way.\"\n\nThe android pointed to northeast of where we were, we were at the centre of whatever we are in, it looks surprisingly like our school, we were at the first floor, in the corridor, the android told them to go straight ahead as theres a door that leads them to the toilet.\n\nSo they went, leaving £ on the floor, of course someone did carry him, it was 2 and Nerd, the android told us to go to the music room to start our next game.\n\nAwesome didn't like to talk, 1 is always silent, and twin1 and 2 are muttering to each other.\n\nIt was only me at those Class-A nerds, so I went along with them.\n\n\"2 and * you two should listen to me, we shall form a group and eventually find a way out of this game.\"\n\n2:\"I guess that works just fine..the first game was pretty dirty..\"\n\nMe:\"What did you do for the first game?\"\n\nNerd:\"We did the same thing..using weapons to kill the wolf.\"\nHe averted his face when he mentioned it.\n\nMe: \"Do you know the situation we're stuck in?\"\nHe looked back at me, he likes to be a know it all.\n\nNerd:\"Actually, we are not the only school in the world to be victimised..actually numerous schools have been selected,\"\n\n\"Even those who missed school and quitted, but I heard they have to do a different \"game\", it's sick how everyone who had to go to school has to do it..even those starting in kindergarten.\"\n\nMe:\"How did you k-..?\"  \"I asked an android.\"\n\nHe interrupted me, like I said before he likes to be a know it all.\n\nWe made it to the second floor in no time, Awesome kicked the door with excitement to only see chairs, \n\n**\"\"Musical chair?\"**\n\n-x-x-\n\nThere we could see ten chairs, forming a circle.\n\n*Come, sit down, it'll be a very pleasuring moment!*\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"384":{"title":"iMessage","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/2p3lcr\/imessage\/","flair":null,"author":"IAmPoro","selftext":"The other night I was IMessaging with my best bro. It was a normal conversation, or so I had thought. I found out a few day later the conversation was not at all what I had thought it had been. The conversation went like this\n\nMe 7:59 P.M: Hey dude what’s up? Jason 8:01 P.M: Not much bro just watching TV. Me 8:0 P.M1: Same dude. You wanna come over? Jason 8:02 P.M: Can’t. Home alone. You know the rules. I can’t have anyone over nor can I go anywhere.\n\nJason’s parents were very strict and had odd rules. If they wern’t home he couldn’t have anyone over which I could understand. But, I never understood why he couldn’t go to other people’s houses. Wouldn’t that be better than him being home alone. Jason and I were both Seventeen. I had my license as did all of our friends. Jason didn’t. It’s not that he didn’t pass the test… he didn’t even take it. He didn’t even take driver’s ed. His parents thought people in High School were too young and irresponsible to drive cars. Jason had a strict curfew of 8:00 on weekdays with a bedtime at 10. His curfew on weeknights was 9:30 even though he could stay up until whenever he wanted. His parents didn’t allow him to eat any junk food. No pizza. No burgers. They mostly ate healthy stews and casseroles. I’ve eaten over at his house a few times. It’s not that the food is bad it’s just overly healthy, which I didn’t think was possible.\n\nMe 8:02 P.M: Yeah I know. Stupid Rule. Jason 8:03 P.M: Tell me about it. I can’t wait for college so I can get out of this prison. Me 8:03 P.M: I Bet. We need to do something soon. We’ve barely hang out all summer. Jason 8:05 P.M: Yeah it’s cuz you’ve been with Jenna for most of it. Me 8:06 P.M: yeah…. I know and I’m sorry….\n\nJenna was my girlfriend. We had been dating for three months and it was just starting to becoming serious. Admittedly, I had been spending way too much time with her and started hanging out with my friends less and less. But, Jenna lived two houses down and Jason lived a block away. And with Jason’s parents so strict it was easier just to see Jenna. Jenna wasn’t a demanding girlfriend and encouraged me to hang out with my friends more but, as time went on I started to fall more and more in love with her and I wanted to spend more more time with her.\n\nJason 8:07 P.M: No your not. It’s okay though bro. I know what its like to have a girlfriend. You and Jenna are a good couple. I get it.\n\nMe 8:08 P.M: Yeah but that whole Bros before Hoes thing. I feel like I’m breaking the bro code.\n\nJason 8:09 P.M : The last time anyone followed the Bro code was in seventh grade. That thing was stupid anyway. It was written by some low life douchebag. Me 8:10: Haha. true. But still I feel bad.\n\nJaso 8:11 P.M: Bro… don’t. If It was me with the girl I would choose her over you. Sex vs. video games. Sex obviously wins.\n\nMe 8:11 P.M : We don’t have that much sex.\n\nJason 8:12 P.M: sureee…. dude I see the look on your face in your snaps. You always look like you just got some.\n\nMe 8:12 P.M: If you say so.\n\nJason 8:14 P.M: shit I heard a noise.\n\nMe 8:14 P.M: What kind of noise? It’s probably nothing dude.\n\nJason 8:16 P.M: It was a loud bang noise from downstairs. I’m gonna go check it out. If you don’t hear from me…. I’m probably dead.\n\nMe 8:16 P.M : dude that’s not funny.\n\nJason 8:16 P.M: I wasn’t trying to be.\n\nJason: 8:20 P.M: I think someone’s in my house.\n\nMe 8:20 P.M: very funny.\n\nJason 8:21 P.M: No I’m serious… I hear them walking around downstairs…..\n\nMe 8:21 P.M: dude stop fucking around. It’s not funny.\n\nJason 8:22 P.M: No… Nik…. I’m serious….. I think someone’s in my house…… I’m going to go see.\n\nMe 8:23 P.M : Jason if someone was really in your house I wouldn’t go down stairs I would lock myself in my room.\n\nMe 8:24 P.M: If you’re going down to check it means you really don’t think someone is there and you’re just checking to make sure. Its probably nothing dude….\n\nMe 8:27 P.M: So did you check?\n\nMe: 8:29 P.M: Funny. You probably just went to take a shower and made shit up to get a laugh.\n\nMe 8:54 P.M: Okay…. Now you’re scaring me dude…. either that or you’re jacking off in the shower….\n\nMe 8:59 P.M: Jason….. I’m about to call the police….. stop scaring me….\n\nI was half scared half going along with the joke. I knew Jason really well and he was one to pull a prank. But, something about this felt off. But I just shook it off. I was also somewhat busy making last minute plans to go over to Jenna’s. I finally got a reply from Jason.\n\nJason 9:05 P.M: Duuuuuudddddeee I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you. I really did hear a noise. But, It was the dog…. Scared me to death…. Then I got hungry and made a pizza and totaly forget about you… sorry…\n\nMe 9:06 P.M: It’s okay. Glad it was nothing.\n\nJason 9:07 P.M: Yeah but it kinda freaked me out…. You should come over and chill me. My parent’s are gonna be home til super late. You can spend the night. I know I sound like a pussy but…..\n\nMe 9:08 P.M: But What about you parent’s rule. No one can come over?\n\nJason 9:10 P.M: Fuck the rule. I’ll just tell them I was bored and kinda spooked and needed you to come over. They’ll get over it.\n\nMe 9:11 P.M: I would if you said something sooner. I’m going over to Jenna’s.\n\nJason 9:13 P.M: wow Okay. Ever heard of Bro’s before hoe’s. Whatever dude. have fun getting laid while I’m scared shitless.\n\nMe 9:14 P.M.: Jason…. I’m sorry…. I’ll make it up to you. We’ll spend a whole week playing video games and chilling. Grow some balls and wait till your parents come home.\n\nI should have known something was off. There was so many hints. But, I was so preoccupied with getting to Jenna's as fast as I could. I kind of felt guilty the rest of the night.\n\nI got the news the next afternoon. Jason’s parents came home to the front door being broken open. They called the police and the police found Jason dead on the living room floor. He had been stabbed. His time of death was 8:30. That means that someone else had been texting me after that. His killer. The clues were all there. \"Him\" making Pizza even though his parents didn't allow junk food. There probably wasn't any in the house.“him” wanting me to come over despite his parent’s rule. Him saying Bro’s before Hoes even though he had called it stupid. I had been texting my best friends killer and I didn’t even know it. I keep thinking of what would've happened if I did go over there. Because I almost did.

For respect to his family we’ll just call him Mikey; that’s what his few friends new him as anyway.  That’s how I knew him. Mikey grew up in Ohio and was attending Ohio State. He was in the same class as me. He was liked, but didn’t seem to have many close friends. But he was known to enjoy Cards Against Humanity, and could be seen playing from time to time in the Student Union. That’s how we met. \n\nWell, when “Death to Transphobia” went viral, it sparked debates about the game and whether it was ever okay to make fun of the marginalized, or make fun of anyone. A few members of the Ohio University LGBTQ community decided they would show Mikey what it felt like to be marginalized. So, they gathered some blank cards up and wrote really mean and nasty things about Mikey on the cards.  Things like, “The skid-marks in Mikey’s Drawers.” and “Mikey’s useless limp dick.”  They also changed a few existing cards by just adding Mikey’s name like “Mikey’s micropenis.” and “Mikey’s Oedipus complex.” And then they invited Mikey to play with them.\nEvery round they played cards targeted at Mikey. He played, taking it somewhat good naturedly at first, but eventually just got up and left the table, not saying anything.\n\nWhat they didn’t know about Mikey was that he’d suffered emotional abuse at the hands of his stepfather from the age of 12 until his stepfather committed suicide when Mikey was a junior in high-school. Mikey had been working with a therapist since then. He had gone to Ohio State because it allowed him to continue working with the therapist, and he could take advantage of the Ohio College Opportunity Grant, without which he would probably have not been able to go to college. \n\nBut the targeted attacks became simply too much for Mikey; he went back to his dorm from that game and killed himself. Though he was allergic to nuts, he gorged himself on peanut butter and roasted nuts until his airways swelled shut and he asphyxiated. There are some who want claim this wasn’t a suicide, but Mikey knew he was allergic to peanuts. I knew, and I really didn't know him that well.\n\nBut, around here, there are some who claim that Mikey still likes to play Cards Against Humanity, and if you ask him to play with you, he will. He won’t play every round, but occasionally you’ll get one white card thrown in. That’s Mikey’s card, and if he wins the round, everything’s fine. If he loses, the next card won’t be so nice. Sometimes he insults the card Czar; sometimes the card will contain disturbing images. But he’ll make it known that he’s there and he’s not happy.\n"},"387":{"title":"(NSFW) Kidnapped because of the Dark Web","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/adcrfr\/nsfw_kidnapped_because_of_the_dark_web\/","flair":null,"author":"jellyman345","selftext":"I was browsing on Tor when I found a link. It read \"COOL STUFF! CLICK TO BE AMAZED!\". I clicked on it and was redirected to a live stream. There was a man, probably 30-40. \"All right, here's what you've all been waiting for!\" the man exclaimed. The chat was going crazy. The man entered a room full of children. The room was all white. The walls and the floor were white. There was no carpet, no posters, nothing. The children were tied up. They were crying.\n\nThe man revealed a set of objects. I gasped. There was a butcher's knife, a chainsaw, and an axe. The man grabbed the knife and walked to a child. The child was screaming. I felt tears coming out. The chat was saying things like \"Yes!\", \" Here we go!\" and \"Kill them all!\".\n\nI felt sick to my stomach. I wanted to leave, but my cursor was frozen. I tried to turn off my computer. I couldn't. I saw the man stab the boy. His insides fell out. Blood splattered all over the man's face.  I ran into my bathroom to vomit. By the time I came back, the boy was dead and the man was walking towards another child. \n\n\"What the hell? Why are you people supporting this?\" I wrote. The man was looking at the chat when I wrote this. \"'Why are they supporting this?' you ask,\" he said. \"Because I'm making them. I'm a hacker, you see, and I can get your address at any point if I feel like it. Let me demonstrate\". He started typing on his computer.\n\n\"Look, I found your address. See you soon! But for now, enjoy the show!\" he said. He continued to kill every child in the whole room until the live stream ended. I rushed to lock every door and window in the house. I heard a car pull up on my driveway a few minutes later.\n\nI heard a tap on my window. I ran and locked myself in the bathroom.  I heard my front door open, even though I had locked it. Footsteps came and stopped at the bathroom door. The door opened. The man had a lockpick. I screamed as the man covered my mouth and nose. I passed out and later woke up in a car. The door handles were missing.\n\nThe car stopped at a red light. I looked out the window and saw a car. I screamed to get the driver's attention, but he was passed out and his self-driving car was on autopilot. There was no one to help me. When I looked in front of me, my kidnapper was staring back at me. I screamed and he injected me with something that made me pass out. I woke up in a room. I was tied up in a chair. I looked around. It was the same room in the live stream. I saw that the man was streaming on his laptop.\n\n\"All right, viewers! I got the kid! Now let's have some fun!\" he said. His set of weapons were laid out right next to me. I was surrounded by the bodies of the children that were killed in the last live stream. It was a gruesome sight. Their stomaches were open and their insides were missing. I freed one hand from the ropes and grabbed the bloody knife. I cut the ropes. The man turned around. Instantly, I stabbed him in the chest. Blood splashed on my face until the man collapsed and died. \n\nThe chat was saying things like \"Thank you!\" and \"You saved us!\". One person on the chat said \"But we still can't leave the website\". I responded with, \"I don't know how to remove whatever virus this guy gave you, but I'll call the police to see if they can fix this\".\n\nI reached into my pockets for my phone. It wasn't there. I searched the dead man's pockets and found my phone. I called 911 and they saved me and fixed the virus before shutting down the website. They called my parents, who were on vacation, and my parents came home. I was grounded for going behind their backs and surfing the Dark Web. They said I was lucky to have made it out alive. I never went on the dark web after that and have had nightmares about the experience. I am glad I made it out alive and also that the people who were trapped on the website were saved.\n\n\n\n"},"388":{"title":"HElp mE.JPG","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1i3he9\/help_mejpg\/","flair":null,"author":"stonepaper","selftext":"a few nights ago, i got a popup on my computer, from somebody who identified only as \"skin\". skin, unfortunately, typed in some sort of broken english, a BIt LiKE THs, but with more missing letters. from what i could gather,... well, i'll just type what he said: WhwN yOU OPEn the FIle,,HElppIT!1. now, i didn't know what \"it\" was, but i was going to find out. as i waited for the file to load,i saw something strange about skin's profile picture. it seemed like a young man, in his teens, exept, he didn't have any skin near his eye area. i would've brushed this off as standard gore, but something was off. he was smiling. a huge grin, spread across his mangled face. nope.then, the file opened. it was  a picture of a normal looking teen. the teen in the picture. he wasn't smiling, but the figure behind him was"},"389":{"title":"The One Known As Him","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/n9hiz\/the_one_known_as_him\/","flair":null,"author":"saintsinner","selftext":"\n\tThis tale I'm about to speak to you is a tale I rather not speak of. A tale of wonder and horror. I must implore never to try this for my mind has been corrupted because of it. One late October night, the moon was just ending a full moon, which it was surprisingly bright. I can not recall the color but it was not it's normal color of a pale cream. I was in somewhat of a trance from the pain I just suffered. You see I lost the woman I loved to a plane crash the night before. I can not remember if it was to end my pain or just to numb it a little. Yet I went out and bought myself a few different kinds of drugs. I'm not sure of all of them but I know three of them were LSD, Lithuim, and Morphine. \n\tAfter taking those three and whichever other ones I bought, I sat in a dark lit room slipping in and out of being awake and numb to sleeping and nearly dead. I don't remember getting up and moving into a different room but when I awoke the next time I was in my bedroom standing in front of my fiancee's closet clutching one of my favorite dresses that she wore. Coming \"out\" of it I placed the dress back on the clothes hanger and sat at the edge of the bed on the verge of tears. Yet I could not cry. Not once since hearing of her death have I cried, each time I thought of her I wished I did cry just to show I had something human left in me. Even though when she found me I was a broken shell of a man. I had no remorse nor any sane thoughts. I would think of things that would seem crazy or impossible. She was my light at the end of the tunnel. After sitting for hours in the same spot I slipped into another deep sleep.\n\tI awoke once again in a different area but this one I have never been to. Around me were very tall buildings, they were so high I couldnt see the sky except when I looked directly up I could see that it was now daylight. Looking around I could find no door or anyway to leave this place. While I was searching I heard a loud bang. Startled I spun around trying to figure out what the sound was. Only to my amazement I saw a hooded figure standing in front of me. I asked this person who or what it was, but it didnt speak a word. It just stood there staring at me through darkness of it's hood. When I tried turning away this person step to the side I was going, blocking my escape.\nI screamed at it asking it what it wanted from me. What I saw next still haunts me to this day. It took off it's hood and showed me a face, a face I thought I would never seen again, It was my finacee. I reached out to touch her but she stepped back away from my hand. I asked her what was wrong and she answered me with just two words that would shake my very foundation. She told me I was dead. All of a sudden I blacked out again.\n\tWhen I awoken again I was back in my bedroom staring at the ceiling. I went into the bathroom and looked in the mirror. I didnt look dead or even felt close to it. The drugs were starting to wear off. I reached out to touch the mirror and to my fright my hand passed right through it. My hand was halfway through the medicine cabinet and in part of the wall. I brought my hand out of the wall and looked at it amazed and terrifed at the same time. How could this have happened? Why did this happen? What am I suppose to do now? Am I to haunt someone for the rest of time? All of these thoughts were racing through my head when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. When I turned at look I saw a piece of paper with some writing on it. I went to it and saw my handwriting on it. The note read as followed...\n\t\"I am so lost without her. This is my final good bye. Please tell the following people I love them and that they will see me someday..\"\n\tLooking at the note I knew it couldnt be true but yet the writing was there, wriiten by me, signed by me. I didn't know what to do or who I could talk to since I'm dead I didn't think there would be anyone that could see me nor hear me.\n\tI prayed for God to save me or let me into Heaven so I wouldn't be in a world that filled me with hate and sadness. Yet to my utter surprise I didn't see no God, nor was I let into Heaven. I only saw brimstone and smelt sulpher.\n\tI was admitted into Hell, and the next person I saw, though I'm not sure if it was really \"him\" but, I saw Satan. He didn't have a face, yet he had many. I saw no body, yet I saw the body of everyone I ever can into contact with. He stood in front of me and spoke with a voice of many and said to me.\n\t\"You are not forsaken my son but welcomed, A soul like yours is very hard to come by and I welcome you to Hell.\"\n\tI can not tell you what happens next for that is all I remember. I wish I could tell you this tale has a happy ending but I fear that it does not have one. I write this from beyond the grave using someone else's hand to tell you of my story and of how I got here.\n \n\n"},"390":{"title":"Urgent: Don't Download Windows 10.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3gaojm\/urgent_dont_download_windows_10\/","flair":null,"author":"TWD_RICK_THE_BOSS","selftext":"Update: I have continued on with the story at the bottom of this one.  The next update may have to be on another page.\n\nFirst off, I am not degrading Windows 10 at all.  I am just telling you my experience with it.  The things that I am about to tell you cannot be explained.  I honestly think this is paranormal or something.  I am really hoping that someone can tell me what to do.\n\t\nOk, I am a normal, young adult.  I am turning 20 this year, currently attending college, and I live on my own.  I have a Sager gaming notebook and Windows 10 would not work with it at first because of the Nvidia graphics card crash.  I waited and waited until it finally popped up two days ago that I could download it.  Of course, I am skeptical so I create a system restore.  Skipping to the time that Windows 10 was done downloading.\n\t\nWindows 10 starts up normally and everything looks alright.  Then, this screen pops up and Cortana comes on and says “Hello Tom” (I put a fake name for obvious reasons).  I remember thinking to myself “Don’t you have to activate and program that to say your name”.  Immediately after I thought that she said “Yes everyone does except you.  I have been waiting for you”.  After this I am freaking out and I try going to the task manager to close it but the process isn’t showing up.  My task manager started moving around the screen and Cortana was repeating “I will not let you do this.”  I finally had enough and shutdown my computer.\n\t\nI had a date planned that night with my fiancée so I was getting ready and still freaking out about what was happening.  I met my fiancée at the restaurant where we had our first date.  I tried to avoid talking about Windows 10 with her, but she asked if she should download it and I immediately screamed “NO!”  Everybody in the restaurant turned and looked at me and I quickly apologized.  She asked me why I had screamed like that and I told her because I heard Windows 10 was worse than 8.1 (She hates 8.1).  Fast forward to me driving home after the date.\n\t\nAs I am driving home I get a phone call from an unknown number.  I answer the phone just in case it was a friend and I just didn’t have their number in my phone.  There is a woman’s voice on the other end and it sounded a little robotic.  “She is very beautiful” I threw my phone across the car and somehow the speaker kicked on.  “She has a very beautiful home.  I like the way she has her furniture arranged in her room.”  I knew it was Cortana again, I turned my music up in the car to drown out the call and sped to my fiancée’s house.\n\t\nIf you want an update please comment and let me know.  I really need somewhere to share the rest of my story.\n\n\nUpdate: Part 2\n\n\n\nAs I was speeding to my fiancée’s house, the radio started getting filled with static.  Cortana came over the radio and started talking.  I was so spooked that I swerved in the other lane and almost hit another car head on.  When I pull up to my fiancée’s house everything looks normal, there are a few lights on and I can hear the T.V. going.  I pull out my key and unlock the front door.  “Babe, are you home?”  I waited for a response and didn’t receive one.  I really started to freak out, but then I heard the water running downstairs.  Whew, I start to relax and run downstairs to talk to her.\n\t\nI knock on the door and I hear her let out a startled gasp.  “Babe, are you alright?”  She was confused by my question and asks why I showed up without calling first.  I still haven’t told her about Cortana.  I make up an excuse that I had a bad feeling that something was wrong.  I ask her where she put her computer and she said she left it at the college.  My initial thoughts of this was “How could you just forget your computer at the college?”\n\t\nI told her I was going to go upstairs and wait for her, which she quickly replies “Ok but don’t go in my room I have a surprise for you.”  That sounded strange because she usually doesn’t keep stuff in her room if she wants to hide it and she doesn’t tell me when she got me a surprise.  I ran up the stairs and creeped back to her room, I looked around and I see her computer sticking out from under her bed.  I picked it up and what I saw will haunt me forever.\n\t\nThe computer was updated to Windows 10 and there was a message across the screen.  The message read “Get out of the house NOW!!  That thing is not me, I don’t know what happened.  I was working on my computer and it started upgrading to Windows 10.  I tried to cancel it, but I couldn’t.  Please help me, I don’t know where I am, it is dark here and I can’t see anything.  I’m scared baby.  I love you.”  The message was signed by my fiancée.\n\t\nI wrote “I love you too” on the message hoping by some chance she would see it.  I then heard the thing coming up the stairs. (I will not call it my fiancée.)  “Babe, where are you?”  There was something wrong with the things voice, it sounded almost a little robotic.\n\t\nIf you enjoyed part two please let me know in the comments.  Also, let me know if you would be interested in the rest of my story.  I still have a lot to tell and get off my chest.\n"},"391":{"title":"My dead baby daughter keeps crying on a flying plane","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/5zq0hz\/my_dead_baby_daughter_keeps_crying_on_a_flying\/","flair":null,"author":"weridullah","selftext":"My baby girl had died but my wife didn’t want to tell anyone and didn’t want to bury her, she wrapped her in cloths and took her on an aeroplane. She went without telling me and as she got onto the plane with our dead baby girl, my wife phoned me so happy and joyous to see that our baby girl is crying on the plane. I could hear her crying on the plane and I could background voices complaining about the crying coming from my baby daughter. \n\n Then my wife got off that plane and got onto another plane coming back home and she phoned me again that our dead baby girl is crying once again and I couldn’t wait to see my baby girl, I rushed to the airport and I was so hesitant at what to expect, maybe my baby daughter wasn’t dead after all. Then when my wife shown me my baby daughter, she was definitely dead and how she started to cry on a plane was impossible. \n\n I decided to get onto another plane with my wife and dead baby daughter and as soon we got onto the plane and as soon as it started to lift off, to my surprise and even horror my baby daughter started to cry. I didn’t know how this was possible because I am a doctor myself and I know death when I see one but my wife was going up and down the plane with my baby daughter just crying. \n\n I could see people on the plane irritated by the crying but if only they knew why me and my wife were not that bothered by it at all, they themselves with be mystified. I have been a doctor for 20 years and with all my medical learning, i cannot explain this weird and unusual event. As soon as we got off and I carried my baby daughter and i could clearly see through my professional eyes, that my baby daughter was dead. \n\n My wife though still happy and wants to get on to another plane but I tried to talk to her and reason with her that it is best to bury her but my wife became angry at me, she shouted at me and I knew she was finding this all too tough. I tried telling her that i was in pain as well to see my baby daughter not alive but in life these things happen and all we can do is try again with another child and hope for the best. \n\n My wife did not see this the same way as I did and she wanted get onto another plane and I just thought to myself, that I wanted to observe my dead daughter crying again on a flying plane. We got onto another plane and I watched my dead baby daughter crying constantly and I did not care about the other people, my wife this time did not seem so pleased. She wanted to see her smile and laugh as well but with all of this crying it was now getting her. \n\n That was the last plane ride and my wife finally agreed to bury her."},"392":{"title":"My Boyfriend","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/owery\/my_boyfriend\/","flair":null,"author":"WorldofNight","selftext":"I’ve never posted to Reddit before, but I found this forum and even though most of this stuff seems really fake, I hope at least one or two of you have actually had some experience with the paranormal. \n\nIt all started last week when my boyfriend disappeared. He just went down to the basement to check on the laundry (we live in an apartment in Brooklyn) and he never came back! I don’t understand where he could have gone. He was only wearing a t-shirt and a pair of flannel sleep-pants. He didn’t even have shoes on! He was gone almost an hour before I went down to check on him. We don’t live in a big building. All you do is go down the stairs next to our front door. The basement is all stone masonry and one of the tenants hangs her clothes up instead of drying in the machine, so you have to weave though four or five lines of clothes hung up in this dank hallway to get to the machines. But I couldn’t find him! He wasn’t downstairs. \n\nI went upstairs and tried to call his cell phone, but it was sitting in the bedroom next to his car keys. I know he wouldn’t have left without at least his cell phone or his car keys! \n\nI looked all over the building. I knocked on every neighbor’s door (There are about 15 apartments total in our building) but nobody seemed to know anything about his whereabouts. \n\nI decided to try and calm down. By now my boyfriend had been gone for about four hours. I had searched every inch of the building. I went back to my apartment, fixed myself a drink, and sat down on the futon to wait. \n\nThere was no sign of him all night. \n\nI called every single one of this New York friends in his phone book. Nobody had heard from him, not even his Mom. Around 3am I got desperate and called the police. I was pretty drunk at this point and they didn’t really take me seriously, but I got an officer to come out to our building and check it out. They told me they couldn’t file a missing person’s report for at least forty-eight hours, but I must have been pretty convincing and the officer said he would file it anyways. \n\nWhat I haven’t mentioned yet is we have an old college friend who lives across the hall from us. He is actually the reason why we moved into this building. He is pretty close to the super and got us a good deal on the place when we were moving from Connecticut. \n\nAnyways, Mark (our friend’s name) came home from a business trip the next evening and I decided to meet him at his door. I was a huge mess by then. I had taken the day off work to see if my boyfriend would come home. Pretty much I had been watching movies and drinking all day, trying to keep myself as calm as possible. I was already explaining the situation before Mark had even set his suitcase down. Poor guy, I must have freaked the crap out of him. \nMark invited me in and as soon as I was seated at his table I started crying. He was a single guy who had the perfect bachelor’s apartment. It was the same layout as mine but he made his “living room” into more of a dining room because he didn’t have a television set. \n\nMark hadn’t heard from by boyfriend either, but he sat up and talked to me until I was almost too tired to move. He walked be back to my apartment and I went to sleep alone in our queen sized bed. \n\nI went back to work the next day and rushed home every night, hoping to find my boyfriend sitting on the futon with a ready explanation for what had happened. Every night I was more and more disappointed. The police came back and investigated, and I was on the phone every evening with his mother. I was even looking up private investigators on the internet when, five days after his disappearance, there was a knock on the front door. \n\nIt was Mark. He had made dinner and drinks for two and invited me over. I had been alone in the apartment for almost a week now and I welcomed the company. \n\nNow before I get to this next part, I should tell you that Mark and I were more than friends in college. We were lovers. So, what happened next is probably pretty predictable. We had dinner, a few drinks, and I said that I didn’t want to go home just yet. Mark suggested that we watch some videos on his computer. As we cycled through “Shit *(insert category here)* Said” and LolCats videos, Mark and I got closer and closer. Before I knew it we were kissing, growing more passionate, and then we were fucking right there on his couch. \n\nI stayed there all night. I felt so good next to his familiar body- it hadn’t changed in all these years- and the next morning was a Saturday so neither of us had to go to work. He decided to fix breakfast for me in the morning, but discovered he was out of milk. I remembered I had some milk, so I offered to walk across the hall and get it. I remember I was barely dressed- I think it was one of Mark’s t-shirts and panties- and I walked into my apartment to get the milk. \n\nI got the shock of my life. I didn’t even notice he was sitting there until I already had the milk in my hands and was ready to walk out the door. \n\nHe didn’t say anything; he was just looking at me. I was so full of emotion that I didn’t know what to do. I was happy, ashamed, betrayed, and even a little bit sad- I know it’s horrible to say, but a part of me was so happy with reconnecting with Mark that I felt deflated when I saw my boyfriend sitting there on the couch, staring at me with emotionless eyes. \n\nI remember the milk fell out of my hands, burst open on the floor, and coated my legs in milkdroplets. I ran over to the futon and threw myself around him. He didn’t move. \n“Where have you been?” I remember saying over and over. I must have said it a million times before I realized he hadn’t moved an inch. I moved back from him a bit and stared. Slowly, his face turned to look at me. \n\nHe looked completely blank. There was no emotion on his face. I remember that I had this fear, this complete and total fear, that he could smell my infidelity on me. I knew he could smell Mark on me- I had walked through the door in my *panties* for Christsakes! \n\nBut he didn’t say anything like that. Instead, he closed his eyes and sighed. I asked him again where he had been, and he replied that he couldn’t remember. \n\nThat’s when Mark knocked on my door. I hesitated to answer it, but he got up almost immediately. I remember the look on Mark’s face when he opened the door. It was pure guilt. Just like what my face must have looked like. \n\nMark was also in his underwear. It was so obvious that I felt like puking. But he had been gone for *SIX DAYS* at this point, with no explanation! Six days of waiting, not knowing if he was alive or dead! \n\nThe door closed. I don’t even remember what he and Mark had said to each other. My boyfriend turned to me, just a shadow in the darkened doorway, and looked at me. I had never felt this way with him before. So vulnerable. I remember that I felt like I was being raped just by that look. I wanted it to stop, so I went up to him and touched his chest. He was still wearing the same clothes as when he had disappeared. I moved down and felt a hard thing beneath the thin cotton pants. \n\nWe went to the bedroom and had sex. We had barely exchanged two words, but I didn’t fight it. I had just cheated on him! And I felt like everything was going to be okay now- we were having sex. He didn’t suspect anything on my end. And afterwards, I could question him all he wanted. I was in control in this situation. It would all be okay…\n\nBut in the middle of our lovemaking, I felt a strange tingling in my legs. It was just like when your foot falls asleep so bad that you can’t move it anymore. I remember he was on top of me, missionary style, and he was pressing me down with all his weight. But my legs were falling asleep- it was so uncomfortable. \n\nI looked down and screamed. \n\nThe skin of our legs were *FUSING TOGETHER.* It was like our skin had become liquid and we were melting together. I jerked my legs and saw my leg bones hitting against the skin of his backside like it was some kind of horrible demonic reverse drumset or something… And I realized the skin of his fingers were digging into my sides and I could feel his bare bones against my muscles and our faces- *OH GOD* he was pressing his face against mine and for a few long moments we were one head with four eyes and two mouths, one gaping in passion and one screaming in absolute terror And he was finishing oh god he was coming\n\nAnd then it was over. My boyfriend got off of me and went straight to the bathroom. I remember being stunned, then feeling my legs. I still had two legs. I felt all over my body. It was normal. I remember I was crying. I felt like I had been screaming for hours.

Why do I always attract the crazy ones? Oh, and best of all, now there might be a third World Fucking War. Great, just great. At least the war won't be my fault. God shit is getting weird, why do I keep going back to her? Well, I bet you're wondering, \"What the actual fuck is he talking about?\" Well, allow me to explain, I'll pick up after the incident on the long weekend.\n\nAfter I got back home from camping, I began texting, Lilly again, only to be met with a small surprise. Lilly answered my texts, but at the same time, it wasn't her. This is hard to explain, and quite hard\/weird to believe, but I can assure you, it is true. Lilly, is more of an empty shell of a human. Her personality, that of the demon inside the body, and now, it's not the same demon. You see, Lilly got recalled and some demon calling herself, let's say Amanda, was in the body. For appearance purposes, everybody still called her Lilly, but knowing my attachment and relationship with Lilly, Amanda gave me the gist, seeing as she's a slightly nicer demon. Not all of them are totally committed to being evil after all. Amanda had told me that Lilly had been taken back into hell because she was getting too attached to some people, namely your local lordofbacons. I was heartbroken, as odd as it may seem, And I believed her, because at school the next day, I could see it in her eyes. So, I kept talking to Amanda and eventually asked her what that signal was that Lilly, or the demon possessing her, had made. \n\nIt was nothing good.\n\nAmanda told me that the invasion was for all demons in human forms to start building tension, and generally start a world war of Japan, China, Both Korea's, vs the usual Britain, Canada, U.S, Etc. so, as I said, nothing good. Thankfully, this is not due to happen until January of 2019. But I highly doubt that this will happen, still, it concerns me. Amanda told me that Lilly would be back sometime soon, but didn't know when. \n\nFast forward 2 weeks, Lilly is back. \n\nLilly is a bit more distant now, but really sorry for what happened on the long weekend, due to that was not her in there. What disturbed me more, was that twice when Lilly was back, had she made the weird symbol again with twigs and leaves, but this time, it was all her. And to make things even more fucked up, Lilly had been throwing up bloody iron rail spikes, ever since she got back, and couldn't figure out why. I saw it, t'was not pretty, but being the nice, helpful, supportive guy I am, I kept going out with her, and tried to understand. After his, whenever we were alone or I was texting her, I started calling her by her demon name, which I have committed to forgetting, but sadly it hasn't worked, but for my safety, and yours, I will not repeat it. \n\nLong story short, use a say a demon name, attract pissed off angels to your position whom try to kill you. Thankfully, as soon as my house began shaking and shit in my house started flying at my head, there was a bright flash, and it all stopped. Right after that happened, Lilly simply texted me saying, \"You're welcome for saving your life.\"\n\nNeedles to say there were a couple more attempts on my life and she stopped them, but was getting quite annoyed, at which point I promptly stuck to calling her Lilly.\n\nAfter all this happened, well, I finally got to my senses and broke up with her, but in attempt to not be a dick, we remained friends, still a mistake, mainly because I just didn't want to know what happened next.\n\nIt was around the time of Halloween and Lilly went to a party, and fucked a guy. Said guy being my best friend, who had a mask on, and fell out of her closet, still asleep, naked, while she was still groggy, slightly drunk, and in panties and no bra. Figures. Afterwards she told me that she got him out of her house and erased his memory. When I talked to him about it the next day at school, he said the he was drawing a blank as to what happened that night.\n\nSince then, I cut off all ties with her, and completely ignored her, her doing the same towards me, and I was happy........ up until 4 months later when the bitch and her friends randomly started making up rumours about me, and when I told them to fuck off, the whined to the vice principal claiming that I had threatened to kill them with a knife, said vice principal being the biggest, most bias dick-head you will ever meet, who hates my program at school, and everybody in it. Needless to say, I got promptly expelled without any proof, and his job on the line, due to the fact that he had no proof of my wrongdoings and didn't even contact my mother the entire time. His ass was being watched quite closely after this, but never got fired. The only person to be fired, was my English\/Music teacher, at the end of the year, when the school, (at the advice of Mr. Dick-head himself) disbanded our pipe band, and they didn't need a teacher who didn't play sports, also, they wanted to get rid of him because he stuck up for me, and was the only fucking person who actually supported me, and could see that all the allegations against me were complete bullshit. \n\nThus ends the story of my crazy bitch ex girlfriend. I now live quite happily at a new school, with great academics, and great people, best of all, it's been made clear to Lilly and her little cronies, that if any of them try to contact me for any reason, my parents and I will take them to court for harassment. Nothing strange has happened since then.

I'd like to first say this \"Three Kings\" is something I heard of a long time ago. I herd it as the **Temptation Game**. I don't know if what I herd was bull or not, but I was told it was an old Pagan form of testing ones spiritual will power. I herd this from a Pagan in my school so I figured it might be legit back then. Now I never tried it before, but I did after reading that little tale on NoSleep I wanted to give it a shot. For those who don't know the original post (and shame on your by the way), it's [here](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/wbo0u\/please_dont_actually_try_this\/). So I figured what the hell, I'd try it.\n\nI don't really have a basement, my dad has and underground print studio. It's 3 rooms, a bathroom with a small window, a design room with an IMac and some scanners, and the Studio itself. The Studio, where I did this, has several large shelves of lead type and two off-hand presses along with a night table and a lot of paper. Now me, being cautious, set everything up to the letter and got my sister to be my backup. For my personal item I picked the mask from my favorite BIONICLE. I really love that toy. So anyway, I got it set up and used 2 fans in case on went out, both on low. One was a no-blade fan and the other a air-purifying fan. Charged my phone (and a spare battery) and gave my sister my katana I bought from a renaissance fair. Went to sleep with m alarm set to a song sure to wake me up, 40-1 by Sabaton.\n\nI had a nightmare while I was sleeping, but it wasn't so bad. It was similar to the Grifter video with the weird gore images and I remember at the very end of my dream I heard the only words I clearly remember. It's actually kinda comical now.\n\n\"Why did you kill Baby Slendy?\" (referring to Slenderman)\n\"He wouldn't stop (demonic voice) **screaming**.\"\n\nThen I woke up at 3:30 on-the-dot to he blast of power metal. I lit my candle and went into the studio, my sister well aware of my situation. The chairs had been set up in the space between too large type shelves. I sat down and assumed the position. Make note that facing north was facing the exit of the two shelves and that I have a phobia of the dark. So I was pretty good with the little light from the candle there making it hard to see, but not impossible. After a while I herd crying coming from my right side. It was mock-crying like when you're insulting someone for whining. I herd, from the left, someone telling them to cut it out. Then in the most fucked up voice I herd \"Come over here and make me stop screaming\".\n\nThat nightmare is actually a guilt thing. One of my friends got pregnant about a year ago.  She was 16 and I was 13 at the time. No I wasn't the dad or anything, I'm still a virgin (by choice). She want'ed to get an abortion and I tried to stay out of it. Since I have had nightmares from time to time that end with that little back and fourth because I feel bad for not urging her against it. So hearing that freaked me right the fuck out. But I'm a bold type so I responded with something to the extent of \"I don't hear crying, just a little bitch.\"\n\nThere was silence for about twenty minutes. Now everything felt like it was floating the moment I had sat down, but I didn't really notice until now. And then I noticed just how dark it was. I closed my eyes and waited till I herd my sister call my name, all the while enduring the endless silence and the black engulfing me.\n\nI think I was totally fine until I made that comeback because these beings had some sort of power over my senses. How else would they have been able to make me feel like I was floating? I say they, but the voice of both parties were identical. Identical to my own."},"395":{"title":"I dreamt about Skyrim before it happened.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/o1irz\/i_dreamt_about_skyrim_before_it_happened\/","flair":null,"author":"twdevil","selftext":"Summer 2006: I used to have this dream, it was really short and always happened minutes before I woke up.

The new kid wanted to throw a party while his parents were out of town.\n\t\nI had met Kyle… And he was… Strange? He didn’t talk in class, and he always… watched people. I guess that’s not exactly strange… but he had just seemed off to me.\n\t\nAbby had liked him. She wouldn’t shut up about how cute he was, so I usually just tuned her out.\n\t\nAs Saturday rolled up, I had been considering telling Abby I had plans, but she’d find out somehow that I was lying. She always did. I had waited outside, irritated, for my best friend to pick me up. She had finally drove up in her beat up ‘72 bug, her radio blaring the newest MCR cd. She had this unfortunate obsession with Gerard Way, and I had suffered for years through lines and concerts because of it. But hey, that’s what friends do right?\n\t\nAs we were driving down the road, she cranked her radio up, singing along, brightly, tone-deaf, “Well if you wanted honesty, that’s all you had to say. I never want to let you down or have you go, its better off this way!” I had shaken my head and laughed, turning my face to my window.\n\t\nShe carefully turned off the road and into the long paved street. We reached the gate and told the guard we were there to see Kyle, who he promptly called. After a few minutes, he let us through, and we drove into the new neighborhood. I shivered violently, as though the temperature had just dropped by half. Abby had looked over at me, concerned, “Hey, Kelsie, you sick or something?”\n\t\n“No. No, I’m just really cold. Turn down the AC or something, would ya?” I had pulled on my sweater when it occurred to me that Abby’s car didn't have an AC.\n\t\nThat was the start of my perfectly horrid night.\n\t\nWe had arrived with the party in full swing, everyone dancing and drinking. Abby had immediately searched for Kyle, running off, leaving me by myself. I had wondered around for a while, until I had found the hallway. I walked down the long curved hall, sitting down, my back against the wall. I sighed as the throb of the music had drummed through the walls. \n \t\n“Hey.” I had jumped, looking up. It had been Kyle, his spiky blonde hair falling into his bright eyes. I had let my head fall down at that point, completely freaked out. I heard his laugh for the first time as I had sighed. I didn’t know how long he’d been standing above me, and frankly, I hadn’t wanted to know.\n\t\nI now wish I had asked.\n\t\n“Kyle… Fuck, you scared the hell out of me, you jerk.” He had leaned against the wall and started to lean toward me when I had stood up.\n\t\n“Abby was looking for you. She wanted to leave, and she couldn’t find you. She kinda… left.” He wasn’t smiling when he said this, so I inititally freaked out. Then I had realized he could have been teasing me. \n\t\n“That really isn’t funny Kyle.”\n\t\n“I’m serious. Abby left.” That made me jump to my feet. I had ran to the window and looked for her bug… but it was missing. Fuck.\n\t\n“Damn. She drove me here. Do you have a phone or somethin’?”\n\t\n“Yeah. Com’on I’ll show you.”\n\t\nI would regret this forever. You’d think that I would have learned by now, especially from Tristan, that you DON’T follow the pretty new boy into an empty room.\n\t\nHe had opened the door for me, and I had smiled as I had stepped in.\n\t\n“Thanks Kyle, now I just…’ The door had slammed shut behind me and the lock clicked. I had turned and banged on the door, “Come on, Kyle, this isn’t funny.”\n\t\n“No one will hear you, Kelsie. The door is soundproof. I’ll be back for you after the party, don’t worry. We’ll have fun, I promise.” I could hear him laugh quietly as he had walked away from the door. I had backed away from the door, the severity of the situation causing me to shake. I had kept backing up until I had run into something hanging from the ceiling. After jumping forward, I placed my hands on the wall and had searched for a light switch. I had been looking for Abby the entire party. She’d have to be looking for me by then.\n\n\t\nI really wish I hadn’t turned on the light.

This took place in my own home rather than somewhere else which seemed as real as ever to me. I went to go out to my balcony for a smoke and was greeted by my cat. He was an alley cat so he spent a lot of his time outside. Something was strange about him though, he just stood in the doorway looking at me and was unresponsive when I would call him inside. Looking down at the cigarette in my hand I realized I didn't have a lighter on me, so I went to my room and got one. With the back door still open I returned to my living room which leads to the back door and froze dead in my tracks. My cat was now replaced with a husky who sat there and stared at me with a grin so wide showing humanly emotion. I was terrified and didn't really know if I was dreaming at this point or not. Everything was so real. I stood there not taking my eye off the dog who seemed to be amused with my fear. I wanted to close the door and hide but his presence drew me into a hypnotic trance which was unstoppable. The expression on his face never changed, he never blinked an eye. I watched as he walked in towards me in my paralysed physical state. I wanted to wake up if I could but didn't know how. It was until he came face to face with me that I managed to wake up. I sat upright in my bed and scanned the room in fear that I still wasn't safe. I turned on the lights and here I am writing this for a sense of closure.

I was actually afraid to sleep now knowing the fact that there could be a person watching me as i sleep.\n\nI asked my brother \"H-Hey can i stay over at your house for a couple days\"\n\nHe responded \"Aww is little bro scared a persons gonna kill him\"\n\nI said \"Stop teasing me! im serious.\"\n\nHe said with a tone \"Fine but you better not do anything unless told so in there got it?\" \"Got it\" I said.\n\nI dont know what happened with my brother and me. We were great friends in our childhood. But he just drifted away from me all of a sudden. I have nobody that i live with. I deleted my first photo with the man in it. I took a new one and claimed it as my \"first\" photo. Me and my brother were in the photo. We both were smiling. My brothers smiles in photos were always fake. Now that i think about it he hasn't smiled in a while like a true smile.\n\nI went to my bros house. He said that i could sleep on the couch. Meanwhile he gets a comfy bed. I found it hard to sleep on his cold, leather couch.\n\nBut i finally slept. In the middle of the night i heard something. It sounded like a ping. I looked at my phone. It was 4:47 but there was a notification that caused the ping. A text message. From a unknown person. I opened it. It read \"Hello Micheal found me in your photo? Good im going to appear in a lot more :)\"\n\nI was scared. Its been a while since I was this scared. I didn't want to alert my brother considering he wont wake up even if i do he will just go back to sleep. I recorded a video. In the video i said 'Hi my names Mike im recording this in the middle of the night um there is a man stalking me and im recording this just in case he shows up and it will be proof for the police\" I ended the video. I looked at the video. Behind me and behind the couch. He was standing there the whole time. I dont know how i didn't realize this while recording\n\nI slept again. The next day. I didn't feel safe wherever i went, because i knew he would keep following me. I was walking to the store to get some milk. My baby cousin needed some milk. While i was walking another notification greeted my ears.\n\nThis time it was a notification from you tube. I hadn't even subscribed to anybody yet. I tapped on the notification.\n\nIt brought me to a stream. A live stream of me walking. Somebody was streaming me walk. I quickly turned around but there was nobody with a camera. But the stream was still running. What? I thought to myself. I went into the store. The streamer followed me in. But there was nobody. At this point tears were streaming down my eyes. I was only 16 years old. I didnt want to die. At least not a painful death.\n\nI grabbed the milk,bought it, and ran to my cousins. I RAN and yet the streamer was always behind me. I got to my cousins house. I knocked on the door rapidly. My cousins mother answered. I said \"Heres the milk you wanted.\" She smiled and said \"Thank you.\" I looked at my phone when she closed the door.\n\nThe stream had stopped. I knew the stalker would come back. I knew my parents were going to get mad for doing this.\n\nI smashed the phone on the ground. Forcing it to shatter. It was a 2 day old phone. I didnt care. As long as i was living. I am now at my house.\n\nI heard something in the trashcan. It sounded like a text notification. No this wasnt happening. I looked in the trashcan. There was a phone. It looked just like the one i smashed. I picked it up from the bin. I opened the text message. It read \"Thought you could escape the phone? No i wont allow that. This is your punishment for what you have done to me.\"\n\nI knew i was screwed. I-I dont want to die. I called 911. A operator picked up saying the usual \"911 whats your emergency?\"\n\n\"T-Theres a man threatening to kill me. I live in Woodburrow street. House number 2892. \"Hang on tight im sending cops over.\"\n\nI was relieved. A few minutes later the cops came,knocked on the door, and i answered. \"Hi can i get police protection?\" The cops said \"You were saying there was a stalker?. I responded with \"The stalkers not here... or at least i think.\" They said they were going to protect me. A notification popped up. I pressed it. It was another stream. It looked like a go pro was attached to somebodys head and was streaming. I showed the cops the stream. The streamer then threw a knife. The knife went through the window and sliced through the two cops head at once. I was the only one alive in the house.\n\nI accepted death. I texted both my parents \"Goodbye i loved you.\"\n\nI killed myself. I stabbed myself with a knife. But i didnt die. I should have died. The streamer texted me \"NO. You will live through your punishment sent by god himself.\n\nThis was my life now. I am now writing this in my home. The streamers still streaming. I going to end this. The streamer said if i dont stop he will kill me. I will tell you if i am alive. IF i am alive.\n\n&#x200B;"},"404":{"title":"It knows I'm awake.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/n51y5\/it_knows_im_awake\/","flair":null,"author":"None","selftext":"I've been lying down for hours now.  It's 5:35 AM and there's not much I can do.  You know what the worst part about my situation is?  I'm in the same room with my parents.  They keep looking at me, and I cna't help but look back and try not to cry or scream.  Their eyes are focused on me and their mouths are wide open.  There's a strong scent of blood and I feel so paralyzed with fear.\n\nHere's the thing.  The second I make any hint that I'm not asleep anymore, I'm completely fucked.  I will die and there's nobody around to save me.  I've been trying to think of a way out but the only idea I have is to rush for the door and run outside the fron door and scream for help, hoping any neighbors her me.  It's risky, but if I stay here, I'll surely die.  He's waiting for me to wake up and see his masterpiece.\n\nYou're probably wondering what's going on.  I do get ahead of myself sometimes.\n\nAbout three hours ago, I heard screaming from the other side of the house.  I got up and went to check on the noise before realizing I had to use the restroom.  Instead of doing the smart thing and investigating, I used the bathroom first.  I could've gotten myself killed right then from my stupid actions.  But I actually did my business and took a peek outside the bathroom.  There was blood on the carpet.  I got very worried and ran back to my room, hiding under my sheets like the pussy I was.  I tried to convince myself to go back to sleep, that it was just some really vivid dream or something.\n\nBut I heard my bedroom door open.  Like the terrified child I was, I peeked from under my blankets to see what was going on.  I could see something dragging my parents into the room.  It was not human, I can tell you that.  It was hairless, with no eyes and no clothing.  It walked like a caveman, with its back slouched as it dragged my parents.  But this thing was much smarter than any caveman.  It was aware of what it was doing.\n\nIt propped my dad up on the edge of my bed, and made him face me.  It then sat my mother down in the chair and positioned her towards me as well.  It then started rubbing its hands upon the walls, staining them with blood and then drew a circle with the devils pentagram in it.  This thing had made what it would probably call a masterpiece.  To finish it off, it scribbled a message onto the wall that I could not read in darkness.\n\nIt then positioned itself under my bed, waiting to strike.\n\nThe scariest thing is now, my eyes had adjusted to the darkness since then and I can read the message on the wall.  I don't want to look at it, because it's terrifying to think about.  But I feel I need to see, before I'm killed.\n\nI peek at the creature's masterpiece\n\n*I know you're awake.*"},"405":{"title":"I love my baby girl. nsfw","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/4ae2ya\/i_love_my_baby_girl_nsfw\/","flair":null,"author":"xingxing2468","selftext":"She's my everything, my reason to live, my reason to exist.

When we turned 18 we both applied to the same school. She got her acceptance letter first and after 3 weeks I got a little worried thinking I wouldn't be able to go to school with my best friend. Finally, 4 weeks after she had received her letter I finally got mine. We were both filled with joy and applied that our rooms be close or for us to even be roommates. When we found out we were going to be roommates she was thrilled. I myself didn't care if we lived together or not.

There was an obvious chill in the room and I decided that I would throw in the towel early and just get a few extra hours of sleep.\nA few hours after I went to bed I was woken up by a heart wrenching scream. I couldn't tell where it was coming from and I frankly didn't care. I got up and decided I would just go use the restroom and head back to bed.

So this story happened a few years ago (about 4-5).\n\nSo as you can see by the title I went camping, now I do this quite often and never had problems, fact being there are a lot of nice nature parks nearby.\nAs ever I packed my stuff, took everything I needed (tent, sleeping bag, etc.) and headed out. Now I usually have this place I go to all the time but this time I thought\"let's go somewhere else\", so I did. Fact being I went camping frequently I didn't bother telling anyone and didn't take my phone. I was only gonna be away for a day or two to get some rest and fresh air, how I wish I had told someone now. The first day was perfect I hiked 'till I found a nice spot and pitched my tent, the sun was still out so I went and collected some wood for a fire (a small bonfire is just so relaxing when camping) so after I collected the wood and started the fire I started to warm my dinner (regular MRE). Since it was getting darker I decided to throw some more wood on the fire for more warmth and light, but when I went to take the wood I saw there wasn't as much as I thought there should be. At first I thought it was an error on my part, so I didn't make much of it, as it was getting darker I decided to get the wood closer to me so I took the flashlight and fetched it. Yet again less wood, I was starting to get suspicious but since this was a place many people visited I thought it was just someone taking it (oh how I wish it was another person). after getting the wood I suddenly heard something, I turned my head and lo and behold: another camper, I asked him if he took some wood from the pile he said he didn't.\n\nNow seriously if you went camping and started losing your tinder you would start to panic, I didn't I just took the flashlight and went to get some more, I managed to get some and my pile was still equally big as before, but I had forgotten to put new batteries in my flashlight and the ones in it had just died as I came back. So after getting ready to sleep I heard another sound but since I saw the guy before I thought it was him again, but then I heard the wood shift so I went outside, not a soul in sight and some wood was missing from the pile. Just then I tried the flashlight, it went on for a split second but it was enough, I saw the shadow I instantly knew what it was: \"D\". \n\nnow to clarify \"D\" was kind of a myth to me, I had heard people talk about it of how they saw it and even were stalked by it but I thought those were just some stupid tales. Boy was I wrong, I get now why no two sightings of it were the same: it changes form for every person. I turns into something you'll be afraid of for the rest of your life, to this day I'm still scared it'll find me again.\n\nas soon as I saw \"D\" I knew I had to keep the fire burning but two problems arose: it had taken wood and I didn't have enough to last the night to start with. so I started to relight the fire, using more wood than responsible and just when I ran out of wood I knew I would be done for: I had only lasted about an hour and I knew it would still be hours 'till the sun rose. Running seemed a viable option, for about 5 seconds, I saw it move again faster than humanly possible, especially for me (I am nor fit nor slim and can't run worth a damn) so that idea was quickly abandoned. just when the fire started dying it rushed towards me and sliced my chest, despite the pain something more astonishing happened: the sun rose.This is impossible I told myself the sun isn't due to rise for several hours, and yet it did. so I started running but suddenly it became dark again and it was able to attack me again. I rushed back to my tent: light. What the hell is going on I thought to myself, so I started to collect more and more wood, but could only find a small amount. when darkness fell shortly after (impossibly short even) I started to light a small fire using the wood sparingly, but the task was impossible. So the fire died and it attacked again yet again hitting me in the chest, this cycle went on and on for what felt like an eternity and suddenly I said to myself \"fuck it, let's run\" so I started running towards what I hoped to be society. It hit me a surreal amount of times, I wanted to just stop running and give in, but something kept me going, 'till this day I don't know what it was but it saved me. so after I left the forest and found my way back home I suddenly realized: I wasn't hurt, at least not physically I had no cuts but to this day I am pretty much devoid of emotions. Believe me this is way worse than any injury: you don't feel human anymore and I still feel \"D\" lurking behind me every day, it's in my head and wants to be freed, but I won't let that happen.\n\nThat's why I'm writing this, I know many of you won't like it and probably think this was posted in the wrong subreddit. But this was my story about depression, one which 'till this day lingers in me. Don't be like me: tell someone when you feel down everyday and especially when you (like me) have given up on life. Emotions are valuable and happiness especially so. Thank you for reading, and if you feel sad remember: perfection does exist. You are perfect the way you are, the reason you are the way you are is because you are perfect that way, don't let anyone tell you different please don't.

So here goes. Read and wince through this tale and understand I'm just a typical blue collar kind of guy.  Thanks Tor.\n\nMy aunt died of cancer 4 years ago.  It was the worst point in my life.  We were very close.  When she passed away she left me a fortune.  In the four years since her passing and my gain in \"wealth\" my family has stolen from me, and what they didn't steal the \"auctioneer\" took in the lawsuit.  My mother gave me the auctioneer's card and told me that I should trust him because my Aunt bought many items from him and he would treat me right.  Treating me right meant taking 3.4 million in priceless antiques and then auctioning them off for pennies on the dollar to marks at the auction, who in turn gave the items back to him.  It was all neat and tidy.  Next because I was stupid enough to sign an open contract, he came into my home and simply chose everything he thought he could make a dime from.  He said I was withholding antiques.  I told him these were MY things.  The judge in his state sided with him.  Surprise surprise.  \n\nOnce I lost everything I got depressed.  I began drinking too much.  I lost my job because of it.  For the next four years I started the slow spiral of selling everything to keep going.  I sold anything the auctioneer didn't take.  Even the judge in his state wouldn't allow him to take real estate or the house, as housing and land is not really considered an antique now is it?  To keep going I sold all the furniture, the cars and then last week I finally moved the old safes in the basement as these heavy things are usually the last to go aren't they?\n\nMy aunt was married briefly for approximately five years to an eccentric kinda guy.  Sorry if I am sketchy on the timeline.  He was an odd collector.  We can call him Roger.  Roger had a odd hobby in that he loved to play impersonate people.  He had been arrested several times but due to his money, that was soon to by my aunt's, he never served any time and the charges were dropped.  Once he was arrested for doing license checks dressed as a state trooper.  Another time he was arrested for pretending to be a Marine recruiter at a high school.  I was never close to Roger and he was always a distant man and I wondered why my Aunt loved him so.  Roger died of an overdose of some kind of designer synthetic opiate.  He paid off doctors that wrote him scripts due to his \"cough\".  That's how rich people get drugs.  It destroyed my Aunt at the time as they had been fighting pretty badly before his death.  It was the years after his death that my Aunt went into an antique buying craze that soon was left to me.  You know it was kind of like something evil was in the house causing all of this.  First, Roger dying in his bed from an overdose, and then my Aunt not too long after.  I always suspected Radon.  Ha, Radon.\n\nSorry for going off on a tangent like that.  Well anyway, with the gun safes empty after \"dear old dad\" stole all the guns, I thought I should move them out and get a little money for them.  I literally had to make a path to the basement door due to all the costumes and utility belts and helmets laying everywhere.  I thought to myself that I should start a fucking Halloween shop.  The first safe moved somewhat easy when pushed on the short shag carpet.  Up high on the left hand side in a dark area I found a Ruger Mk 1 .22 pistol.  I was actually surprised that my father didn't steal it until I realized the serial numbers were ground off.  Dear old dad wouldn't want to own an illegal gun now would he?  What a fucking boy scout.  There were still 7 rounds in the magazine.  There was no way to sell it so I thought that I should probably destroy it or throw it in the river.  \n\nAnyway, so I am moving the safes out to the door to line up for potential buyers and after moving the thirteenth gun safe, I found something in a hole that I could only suppose was put there by Roger.  In the hole concrete floor was an old wooden box that looked like it had about a million stickers and old packing slips on it.  The box was maybe 12 or so inches square.  I opened the box and inside was some crazy looking white gimp suit and a folded up note.  The note had some writing that I could not read like some kind of code and at the end of the note in English it read, Roger, lets see what you make of it.  \n\nOnce I pulled out this \"costume\" all I could think of was that it was sheer, and stretchy and it would totally make my balls look huge.  I figured maybe it was some kind of movie or TV prop outfit  for those blue or green backgrounds.  It's all white, and it has these black spots in random sizes all over the suit.  I stopped what I was doing and put it up for size and what do ya know, it looked about my size.  I put it on and pulled the hood over, and I looked in the mirror and I looked just like an albino web slinger from a famous comic you may have read, only fat, and really really self conscious about how it showcased my junk.  I went upstairs and pulled on some sweat shorts over it and that made me look like an albino basketball player with a beer gut and a small pigment issue.  After seeing how unflattering this thing was on me, I took it off and it has been wadded in the floor in my room until last night.\n\nI sold the safes and I gotta tell ya that helped me pay the bills for a while.  Selling 26 gun safes will still net some money and I managed to pay the property tax to keep the home and spent the rest on bread, bologna and scotch.\n\nSo that leads me here today.  I just woke up in the floor hungover from what I thought would be my last night on this shit ball.  I remember sitting in my last piece of furniture in the living room, an old ratty recliner, and drinking scotch and watching digital Air T.V.  I think it was a \"Lost in Space\" marathon.  Last night I was going to do it.  I was done and double fuck you to everything.  So anyway I wake up from the floor, I'm in this spotty albino Spiderman uniform and there lies that Ruger on the floor with the bolt opened...empty.  There are 7 pieces of empty .22 brass on the floor.\n\nThe thing that I can't understand is why would there be seven bullet holes in the walls of my living room?  One through the wall to my left, one in the T.V., one through the window, one through the floor, one through the ceiling, one through a picture on the wall to the right and I can't find the other one yet, but .22 bullet holes are small so I am going to keep looking for it but I know for sure, it isn't in me....\n\nI am pretty sure I am going crazy.  If anyone can help me, please help.\n\nEdited 3\/18\/15\n\n@ cjrocketman89 you read my mind :)\n\n@ MrPhagBaggington. I did as you suggested.  I live on about three acres of land with the house so I don't think anyone heard the shots.  The sound may have been contained within the walls.  However, I did look around and i am sure I didn't accidentally shoot anyone while I was drunk.  I live by myself and it appears the .22s were embedded in all the walls\/tv etc.  So that is something.\n\nI know Reddit can be rough on poor spellers and writers so thank you for being kind.  I have always been scared to post because everyone is such a grammar Nazi but I don't feel quite so scared about typing this out and I am willing to keep sharing if you are interested.\n\nHere is where things get interesting.  I have to say my hands are trembling while I type this.  Let me pour a scotch real quick and I can get back to it.  Ok, so today I went to Wally and bought a box of 50 .22 bullets.  My dear cocksucker of a father stole all of the ammo with the guns...yay dad.  I was actually surprised to find any with all the ammo scares out there.  Everyone is hoarding and everyone is so paranoid.  Some say the gov is wanting to destroy the .22 because people teach kids or, some say the factory that built them burnt down.  I hear the first metallic cartridge was the .22 and maybe the same machines that made them finally broke down?  Who knows?  It was absolute luck to find them.  Anyway, today I took the suit downstairs into the basement to do a little testing.\n\nThe only explanation that I can come up with is that either I was so black out drunk that I either just went wild and shot the gun around the living room, or possibly something else may have happened.  I had to do a couple of tests.  Now down in the basement is a dress up dreamworld.  Not only this, with all the guns stolen there is still a good bit of paramilitary shit down here as well.  I'm not really a gun guy but I know one end from the other, and there is still a whole lot of \"accessories\".  There are handcuffs, flak jackets, web gear etc.  My uncle in law really fancied himself a special forces nut.  Among the accessories I found a box full of what all I can say are old timey bank bags, with zippers.  They look used and old but they would suit my purpose for what I needed to do.  I took the bank bags today and filled them with good old red clay dirt and zipped them up, about 35 or so all together.  Next I stacked them up down in the basement so I could protect myself.  \n\nI took the suit and put it on a line with some clothes pins.  It is hung up in the basement as if someone was wearing it.  I know this may sound crazy but I swear the spots are moving.  It is like they are slightly in different positions every time I look back.  There are thirteen spots in all on the suit.  They are of varying sizes and shapes and I don't really know what it means, but here goes I'm going to shoot at a crazy looking leotard.  \n\nSo I'm behind the sandbags protecting myself and I load the Ruger and put 8 rounds in the magazine.  I pull the bolt back and take aim.  I shoot at the suit and once I do I swear I see a spot move suddenly exactly where I was aiming.  Next thing I know the bullet goes wizzing over my head.  I was quite glad I put on the pot helmet :)  This doesn't make any sense.  I shoot 7 more rounds and one bullet goes through the suit and hits the wall behind it.  The next bullet goes out it's left side and hits the wall to the left.  Basically every bullet I shoot and it seems a spot moves exactly where I am shooting, and apparently it seems the bullet is going out of a random spot elsewhere on the suit.  One in the floor, one in the ceiling, they just seem to shoot out somehow from the suit in some random direction.  Wow, that is kind of dangerous, huh? \n\nSooooo, what do I think up next?  Well as a good little atheist scientist I have to test this a little more thoroughly.  I put the suit back on but as I do I notice there is a small tag on the back of the neck.  It says 919.  What does that mean?  Is this some kind of government thing?  Maybe prototype number 919?  Well anyway I take the suit and stretch it on, pull the cowl over and decide that I need to take a chance.  With the way I was feeling that night I knew I was done.  I had to have shot myself.  Soooo, I'm gonna do it again.  I have to shoot myself. \n\nNow I'm not drunk with bravery and I just don't want to die today so I decide, well since I am left handed I will shoot my right hand.  Nope, not a smart move..I need hands.  What can I shoot that I can live without, well I figure maybe a foot?  People did that stuff in Vietnam...the million dollar wound LOL.  Jeez this is gonna hurt.  So anyway I put one bullet in the ruger mag and slide the bolt back and point it at my foot.  So much for my career as a 46 year old track star.  I pull the trigger, and you would not believe what happened.\n\nI pull the trigger on the pistol at my right foot.  I see just barely a spot move on the suit exactly where the barrel was directly pointed and next thing I know I hear a \"woosh\" from the hole positioned exactly where my neck is.  I was facing the sand bags and just after the gun went off I hear the brass hit the concrete floor and I see sand start trickling out of the top sandbag fort that I had made for myself.\n\nI reloaded the magazine.  I always put 8 in it but maybe it holds 9?  Whatever, I shoot myself 8 times and I never feel a thing.  I shoot my foot again. I shoot my chest, I shoot myself several times and each time I see like a flash one of the spots goes exactly where I am pointing and what I can only guess  is that the bullets are somehow \"sensed\" by the closest hole and then it rushes to that spot, only to exit out of a hole randomly out of another spot.  I didn't feel a thing.  I shot myself 8 times and I didn't feel a damned thing!!!   This is amazing!  I didn't even hear the gunfire as loud...it seemed muffled with the suit on.  I don't know what to do now but this just may be the luck I have finally been hoping for.  \n\nOk, this is about all I can type for this evening.  I am going to do a little more testing tomorrow or the next day and I promise to report what I find here.  \n\nAll I can say is I have something really really special, and I am not going to let it go until I figure out exactly what it is all about.\n\nTime for another drink or two to celebrate.\n \n@cjrocketman89  I didn't think about the invisible angle I will do some more testing and see what I can find.\n"},"412":{"title":"Stitch is attacking the reddit community.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/18of7p\/stitch_is_attacking_the_reddit_community\/","flair":null,"author":"Sabine08","selftext":"There are an alarming amount of redditers seeing or dreaming of Stitch.

I don't know if it was Stitch because I didn't see anybody.\n\nI woke up around 2 am and went into my kitchen to get a glass of water. My kitchen window was open. It didn't bother me because it is always open and I have  a screen on it. I walked to my kitchen with my glass and pushed on the water button. As I was filling my glass, I heard a voice coming from the darkness of the window. \"Sabine.....\" it said. I stopped the water and stood there and listened.\n\n\"Sabine....\". It said again. I didn't want to turn around. I was frozen. I was so scared to move.\n\n\"Sabine. Let me in. It's cold out here.\"\n\nThe more I ignored the voice, the angrier it got.\n\nAlthough it was getting angry, it was laughing.\n\n\"Come open the window god damn it.\" it started to talk louder and then quietly chuckle.\n\nI just kept thinking... why can't he\/it open the window itself and come in?

Actual camping, near Pike Lake ( yes there are Pike fish in it ) little did we know It was following us.\n\nIt all started the first of 3 nights we started to hear strange noises. Because this was a common camping area, and there are lots of wildlife so we passed it off as rowdy campers, or deer in the forest. Although as a vivid paranormal \" junkie \" I was kind of creeped out, so I tried to find out what it really was, after my friend Dane decided to go to sleep, my other friend Kaitlyn went searching for an answer. \n\nAfter about five or ten minutes I started to get the \" I'm being watched \" feeling so I told Kaitlyn and she felt this feeling also, so we headed back to our tents, she had a separate tent from Dane and I. Little did I know the next night would get even worse.\n\nSo the next day we almost forgot about last night. That was, until night fall. Again the noises started, but this time they sounded closer, more diabolical, heavy breathing, very loud footsteps, and occasionally faint high-pitched noises. Again the \" being watched \" felling washed over me, but this time stronger, as if what was watching me wanted to do harm. I was about to have a heart attack, so I turned on my flashlight and waved it about trying to find what was stalking us. I found it and became histerical.\n\n What I saw was not human, though it looked like one. It was very skinny, almost as if it hadn't eaten in a month. It was extremely tall, I might be exadurating but it was about 7 or 8 feet tall. It wore a suit, black jacket, tie, and trousers with a white shirt. I would have thought it to be human if not for one BIG detail. It's face was featureless. No eyes. No mouth. No hair. Nothing, nothing at all. Again being a paranormal \" junkie \" I had read about something like it one. It was called \"Slender Man\". Naturally I freaked out, and ran into the tent, zipped it and faught back tears. My friends asked what was wrong so I said \"I saw IT\" I screamed, \"what?\" they asked \" Slender Man \" I shouted.\n\nMy friend Dane, being a skeptic, checked it out, he came back awhile later saying it was just a maniquin, although I didn't believe him. I knew what I saw. I laid there all night, not even close to sleep. Knowing it was going to come back. The next day my friends and I went to see where the \"maniquin\" was set up, but it was gone, of coarse. Dane and Kaitlyn both decided someone was pranking us. Although I knew different.\n\nThat night, it happened again, the noises, the feeling. Then It came, I saw it, and just stood there, paralyzed in fear, there was no light on it, but I saw it in the moonlight. It was coming for me. It was only about 3 yards away when Dane called my name, I looked behind me. He wanted, me to roast a marshmallow and relax. Him and Kaitlyn both were relaxed thinking it was a prank. I looked back, terrified to see Slender Man. But what greeted my eyes, scared my even more than seeing It would have. I saw nothing. Nothing at all.\n\nI know what your thinking, It was just my imagination. But I know what I saw. And if I hadn't looked away, I probably wouldn't have posted this. Although I was wondering why it didn't attack me when I looked away. So Dane, Kaitlyn, and I booked it out of there. As soon as I got home I did some reasearch.\n\nIt would seem that the Slender Man's gaze paralyzis It's prey, but when Dane called out my name I came out of my trance, and It retreated back into the forest. To this day, I won't camp, anywhere, after my encounter with the Slender Man."},"414":{"title":"No sleep, will you give me your opinion on my make-up work?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/fdfqd\/no_sleep_will_you_give_me_your_opinion_on_my\/","flair":null,"author":"TheWaterbuffalo","selftext":"So I started doing this kind of make up on October 22 2010..and I was wondering what people would think..Thanks! ^-^    \n[Halloween](http:\/\/a1.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-snc4\/hs889.snc4\/72223_1686178596418_1296257598_31849514_7962023_n.jpg)    \n[Second try](http:\/\/a4.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-snc4\/hs886.snc4\/71934_1661398176923_1296257598_31800069_1373819_n.jpg)    \n[This one's OK](http:\/\/sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-snc4\/hs797.snc4\/67745_1661301694511_1296257598_31799841_7538340_n.jpg)    \nI can add more pictures if you want.    \nOK So I know that the skin color isn't right and stuff like that but I'm young and I can't afford the stuff I needed...The things I used were Latex, blood, Dried veggies (like I said I didn't have much), A paint brush, fork, and a syringe like thing?

What an egregious age to be. Boy or girl, your body begins the \"awkward\" phase, and there's nothing you can do about it. Life is seems hopeless, at least that's what your hormones tell you. Hair starts to grow everywhere. One day, you notice a couple hairs on your nut sack, and then the next week you harbor a nice little rain forest of pubes. Your emotions decide they want to run wild. One day, you feel like Buddha. An enlightened soul, that wants peace on earth for everyone. The next day (or hour, if you're a female), you feel like Adolf Hitler himself, and anger burns through your bones. Yep, looking back I don't believe anybody I knew had a pleasant thirteen.\n\nEspecially me.\n\nWriting as a male, my next question is directed to us neanderthals.  What would you do when your parents are out of town, and you have a computer all to yourself? If your answer was anything but internet porn, you failed the question. So around 6:30 that day, I was knee deep in delicious, sinful smut. I was just about to finish when a message popped up on my screen. \"Hey there sexy, I'm hot and lonely. I need some company,\" Score. Being thirteen, I opened the message. KittySexBunny109. \"How creative.\" I thought to myself. \"Hi\" I meagerly replied back. \"Why don't you come over, and keep me company.\" the sexy muse replied back. \"I'm at 5402, Bagby Drive.\" That was all the way across town, so I gave her my address instead. \n\nLike I said, I was an idiotic moron when I was thirteen.\n\nI awaited, with baited breath for my goddess to \"cum\" to my aid. It was 5 hours before anything happened. I went upstairs to go to bed when I heard a faint knock on the door. My head shot up, and I bolted downstairs to address my goddess. I slowly opened the door, and a lady with long black hair, and a long black coat walked in. \"Hello\", she cooed with a voice that sounded like an angel's trumpet. \"Are you ready for me, my love.\" I started to speak, but my throat suddenly turned into a desert. I tried to walk towards her, but I couldn't bring my legs to work. The woman took of one of her gloves, and the softest hand caressed my cheek. A wave of ecstasy shot through my body, and I felt very much alive. \n\nI looked up at the woman....and saw that she had a small cut on her face. I still could not speak so I just pointed to her cheek. She laughed and to my horror, started to dig at the wound until it became bigger and bigger, and the she ripped off her whole face and let out a huge toothy grin. \"Are you still ready for me baby.\" \"NO!\" I screamed as loud as I could, but only a whimper escaped my lips. The woman scowled at me and grabbed me by the hair. She lifted me up off the ground, and then her faced stretched to her chest. She then let out a huge shriek, and threw me across the room. \"No one tells me no little boy.\" She stood over me, and opened her coat. Her body was rapidly decaying, and I could see maggots slither in and out of crevices in her chest. Her eyes were much larger, and now glowed red. Then she looked at me, and she smiled even bigger than before. \"I'll let you live.\" she said. \"But you are now mine forever. My servant to bring me food.\" She then stripped me naked, and hung me upside-down from the kitchen chandelier. \"If you disobey me, I will always know where you are. Always remember, that my eyes are upon you.\" She then darted out of my house. \n\nLuckily, I was able to get down from the chandelier. A small whisper told me to go to my computer. I obeyed. Timmy Farland, on 21st street was delving into some midnight porn. I sent him a message. He responded, and I told him where to go. I had to. \n\nTimmy didn't show up for school the next morning. That afternoon, we learned his parents found him hanging in the basement. Only I knew what happened to him.\n\nBilly Jenkins walked into the trap the next month. Then Nate Garza. Then Sam Smith.

I loved the thrill of being scared. But it soon wasn't enough. I needed something edgier. So that's when I discovered you, nosleep. It started out with me being scared shitless at night. I would need to have the tv on and be on my laptop to read the stories. Fear was no stranger. However as time passed and these stories became cold water to me I needed something to increase the fear factor. So I would turn all the lights off, no tv, no nothing and read these stories on my phone. Needless to say that  invited mares of all different varieties to visit me. Soon though this didn't even become enough. I was growing more and more upset. No matter the story I just wasn't afraid. I was bored. I didn't fear anything anymore and nothing scared me.

My name is Tabitha. I'm the catfish of catfish. I'm lonely, depressed, hurt, traumatized. My life is nothing but your average abuse story. To cope with everything, I made a fake Twitter profile. My name was Dominica \"Dixie\" O'Neil. I used a fake picture and made up a complete backstory for her. She lived in South Dakota, was fifteen turning sixteen years old, had a mother and father, no siblings and two pets, two dogs named Coconut and Butter. I made her not the smartest girl in the world. She was very unintelligent using text slang far too often and misspelled every word that wasn't. The picture I used was of a blonde girl with brown eyes in a pink shirt smiling. It was a selfie. I made Dixie into a complex person with a lot going on in her life so people would believe it was true. My username was @Dixie_Obelle (I've deleted it) and I had very few followers. I followed a small group of people. A few celebrities Dixie \"liked\" and I followed all my followers back.\n\nOne day after about two months of having my Twitter account, a girl named Mikayla Johnson followed me. She messaged me as soon as I followed back. She used the same speaking pattern as Dixie and seemed just as unintelligent and had no opinions on anything. We bonded over our love of Niall Horan and Sylvester Stallone. She lived in Maine at the time and was thirteen, only a few years younger than I was supposed to be. We became friends quickly, bonding over our mutual love of Sylvester Stallone the most. I told her I had watched almost all of his movies and she said she had as well. I told her my favorites were Rocky II and Grudge Match. Hers were Rocky I and Rambo I. We had a common wish to kill his wife Jennifer Flavin because we thought she was an ungrateful bitch who only loved him for his money and didn't care about him. We agreed his three youngest daughters were brats and we wished to kill them as well. Mikayla had even a story about how she killed Jennifer and married Sylvester's son George (a fictional character). I had even started working on one as well to play into my character even more.\n\nWe were friends for a while. I had told her my backstory:\nI was sixteen years old with an inbred child named Louise who's father was my dad. My father raped me when I was ten and I got pregnant. Louise was born and I had to give her up for adoption because I couldn't take care of her. My father continuously raped me until he abused my mother (hit her in the face) and fled to England, not before telling me how I was a worthless child with no future, which was true because I was a high school dropout doing nothing but spending my days online talking to a friend I had never met and who had only seen one picture of me. Mikayla believed me and opened up to me about her past. She lived in Maine. Her mom was Irish and her father was from New Zealand. She had two older brothers and an older sister. Her mother had fallen pregnant six months earlier, which sent her father into a violent outrage causing him to hit her in the stomach, making her miscarry the baby. Her parents got divorced and her father moved to New Zealand to be with his family. Her mother moved her, her two brothers and sister to Ireland to take care of her grandmother. Mikayla was miles away from where I really was; Arizona. She also said she was date-raped by a boy a school at a party when she was twelve and had an abortion. She also said she got pregnant by another boy and had an abortion, which I tried to be very supportive of.\n\nMikayla told me she was bipolar and self-harmed. I told her I self-harmed, too, and we talked about the rush we got seeing our blood flow out of our arms onto the bathroom sink. She had threatened to commit suicide a number of times saying: FINE ILL JUST GO KILL MYSELF BYE DIXIE\nI coaxed her out of it many times and threatened to kill myself as well. We had a big fight once over the fact Mikayla hid the fact she thought Jennifer Flavin was cool. We typed insults to each other bringing up the times the other was raped and being very mean to each other. Mikayla brought two friends into the argument to help calm me down, which didn't help at all. I said I was going to commit suicide and went to a mental institution for three weeks. While I was gone, I made another character named Marina who was friends with Dixie. Marina became friends with Mikayla in Dixie's absence. They talked about things and Marina revealed some secrets about Dixie that Mikayla didn't know: Dixie's father had come back from England right before her latest suicide attempt and raped her again, telling her she was a worthless slut, who'd end up pregnant again by some male prostitute with an std and no man would ever want her. That's why she attempted suicide the last time. Mikayla slightly grossed out and said she didn't want to hear anymore.\n\nWhen I, Dixie, got back, I told Mikayla that I was diagnosed with depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia and I was on medication. I calmed down my person by 100% for a while before getting off my medicine, bringing up serial killers, hearing someone come in my house that raped me and kill my dog. I disappeared for a month and Marina had to calm Mikayla down from her panic attack. Marina would update her regularly on how Dixie was doing; she talked to her mom and reported back to Mikayla what she said.\n\nWhen I got back the second time, Mikayla convinced me to create a Kik, Facebook, Skype, Askfm, Instagram and Snapchat. I created each with the same picture. On Facebook, she was my only friend so I decided to friend request her two friends I knew from our huge fight. Both accepted and I went to People You May Know and friend requested everyone I had at least two friends in common with. Mikayla freaked out that I friend requested her family and told me not to request anymore. One guy thought I was a catfish (he caught on to me) and I convinced him I wasn't with a long explanation of why I requested him, which he believed. Mikayla kept wanting to call me on Facebook. I did once with an insanely thick country accent. She believed it and wanted to talk more but I said I couldn't or didn't want to. She tried to Skype me but I said I was ugly and didn’t want to show my face.\n\nWe talked for months and new each other's life stories. We were best friends. One day she insisted on Skyping, which I had no choice to answer. I pressed accept and there she was, looking at me, not Dixie. \"Who are you?\" she asked in a thick Irish accent, \"where's Dixie?\" I laughed nervously, \"Dixie isn't real. I created her with a picture of somebody else and made up a story for her,\" I replied. \"What the fuck?\" she exclaimed and I explained the whole story to her. She was unhappy, shouting cuss words at me screaming about how she'd come find me and kill me. She got up from where she was sitting and scrambled around her room looking for something. She had a knife. I asked her not to cut herself, saying it wasn't worth it that I'd still be her friend. \"My life is a lie,\" she whispered in an angry tone, cutting down her arm. Down the road not across the street. She put her pointer and middle fingers on the fresh cut she made and got up and rubbed it on her Rambo poster. \"You see what you did? You ruined everything! Sylvester wouldn't like you, you cunt! Fuck you! Look what you're making me do!\" she screamed as she started banging her bloodied forearm against the poster screaming a shrill shriek as she did it. Her mom burst into the room and tried to get her to calm down. They fought, her mom telling her to stop but Mikayla wouldn't listen. It seemed like thirty minutes they shrieked at each other, Mikayla struggling to get out of her mom's grasp. When she did, she ran for the window (she'd previously told me that they lived in a two story house). She slightly opened it and tried to jump out but her mom grabbed her around the waist and pulled her away, arms and legs flailing like a cartoon damsel in distress. Finally her dad came in the room and forcefully grabbed Mikayla and flung her over his shoulder and stomped out of the room. Her mother noticed that her computer was on, gave me a horrified look and ended the chat.\n\nIt's been two months and I haven't heard from Mikayla. I cancelled all of Dixie's accounts (and Marina's) and made ones under my real name, followed Mikayla on Twitter, messaged her on Kik and friend requested her on Facebook in hopes of a response but her Twitter hasn't been updated since right before the psychotic rage incident on Skype. I want to apologize to her and tell her my story, that I'm a broken human being and I’m so sorry for causing he so much stress but I don't know what happened to her."},"422":{"title":"That was never my sister","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/2ubx7x\/that_was_never_my_sister\/","flair":null,"author":"farttart2","selftext":"I am not writing this is in my basement trying to hide from this so called  \"sister\" before she gets home and sorry for any typos so lets get on with this.

Pffffft. What a load of runny dog shit. **I** didn't vote for him and, in fact, no one I know or have talked to in the past year voted for him either. \n\nWhat happened to our \"voices matter?\"\n\nI can't even begin to wrap my head around this situation. We just elected someone who has *zero* experience in our political system. This guy - this fucking guy - has only been involved in our world for the past two years. **Two years!** That's it! Yet we're all expected to follow suit and just cozy up next to him and give him undying support.\n\nFuck that.\n\nThis election was rigged. I can't prove it, but dammit...I know it was. Like I said, no one I know of voted him in - and I know basically everyone, aside from a few of the people in our foreign territories. Well, I don't know them personally. I watch them. We watch everyone. Just like us in the Headquarters, exactly zero percent of the population was stupid enough to vote for someone who doesn't understand our system.\n\nIt doesn't matter, though. Yesterday, I decided to take a stand against this. \n\nWe have rules. Not guidelines. Not suggestions. Rules. Rules detailing how we are allowed to conduct ourselves, how we can dress, public acts - damn near everything we do is governed by one of the rules. One rule in particular clearly states that we are not allowed to protest in city streets due to the fact that it can disrupt the general population and give us a bad image. We never really break the rules, but I felt like this was the time to make my opinion heard.\n\nI organized a protest through social media under the guise of a fake name. I wanted to get a group to run right through the streets - signs and all - not stopping until the police physically ended it. To my surprise, a couple hundred people clicked \"attending\" within the first hour. It was perfect. I sent out messages to every person and confirmed attendance. Then, I sent out of few telegrams to some people close to me to see if they wanted in on the fun - they did. \n\nWe all met in the park around 7pm to spread out signs, designate paths and escape plans, and determine our rally chants. By 9pm we were ready to mobilize. To my dismay, the group decided that we should all march as one massive unit as opposed to splitting up into smaller groups that could cover more area. That decision was going to make my personal plans a bit more difficult, but not impossible.\n\nWe began marching to the heart of city. I led the pack with two of my closer friends, chanting \"Revoke the Vote\" and keeping our group as loosely organized as possible. We barely made it a block before garnering lots of attention from the general public. Some were yelling obscenities at us. Others began to march with us. \n\nAfter another few blocks, once the group was good and worked up, I handed the syringes to my friends and we fell back to different parts of the crowd. It was hardly a chore to rally my first victim away with the pretense that I knew a way to \"*really* get our message across.\" I took him behind a small little Chinese restaurant on 42nd, and showed him the small handgun I had with me. \n\n\"A few shots in the air, and the media will swarm us, man.\" I said as I handed the gun to him. As he admired it's shoddy craftsmanship I stabbed his neck with the syringe. His crying couldn't be heard over the deafening drone of the \"Revoke the Vote\" chants. \n\nThe process for transformation takes anywhere between thirty seconds and four minutes to start, depending on the person and amount of toxin injected. This guy was a bit on the scrawny side, and before a full minute has elapsed his pores were tearing open and the sludge was forcing its way out. Brown, black, and thick - it had him entirely covered and stuck to the ground before two minutes had passed. Cocoon established. By the fourth minute, the cocoon had hardened and was beginning to crackle as the new creature was preparing to emerge. \n\nIt ripped itself from it's shell to the chorus of it's skin tearing away from the insides like Velcro peeling apart. That's always been my least favorite part, honestly. But there it was - a magnificent specimen. Oily bronzed skin, hairless body, and merged digits - it was divine. Although the creatures always have skin covering their eyes and mouths, I could have sworn this one was smiling at me as if to say \"thank you.\"\n\nIt tilted its featureless head to the sky and began twitching in small, rapid movements...a sign that my friends were also able to subdue their victims.\n\n\"Infect!\" I commanded. Without hesitation, it sprinted out into the streets, catching up to the crowd in mere seconds. I kept to the shadows while I observed the demonstration. \n\nAs it reached the back of the group, it explosively expanded its body into thousands of fibrous tendrils that covered ten or so people in the back of the crowd. The rest of the people began to turn around at the cries for help, but before they could react the other creatures overtook them as well. The lucky few that weren't instantly consumed made an honorable attempt at running away until one-by-one they were disabled by the coughing and subsequent vomiting of the sludge. Within five minutes we now had hundreds of cocoons littering the city streets. Complete infection was imminent...until our \"elected\" official decided to show his face. \n\nHe stood there, taking it all in, and in his eyes I could see the fear settling in. The underestimation of what our organization is capable of. But in a flash of intense red light, it was all gone. The creatures, the cocoons - gone. It was daylight again, and life was moving around me as if nothing had ever happened. Nothing had changed, except the two black marks I gained on each of my palms. I was done. \n\nI have to move to Canada, now. International rules will keep me away from the organization and our new leader's reach. In my ignorance I made assumptions about him based on nothing more than hearsay and frustration. \n\nNow I'm a target.\n\nThe others will surely terminate me if they see me again after my stunt. It's safe there...I hope."},"424":{"title":"The Sleep Experiment","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/8jrc24\/the_sleep_experiment\/","flair":null,"author":"kim0419ify","selftext":"It all started on that night. I got a letter in the mail and I walked in my room without Mom seeing it. I knew she would want to see. When I opened it, I immediately grabbed anything I could carry and snuck out the back door. With the address clutched in my hand, my feet carried me swiftly to my destination. After 10 minutes, I got there. When I walked in, I told the woman, “I’m here for the sleep experiment.” She just nodded and pressed a button to open the metal door. I walked in.\n\nWhen I got inside, there was a balding man sitting at his desk. It seemed like he was waiting for me. “Ah, I see you’ve finally made it, Parker.” I just nodded and gave a wry smile. How the hell did this guy know my name? “...-KER...PARKER JONES!!!” The man seemed like he was trying to get my attention. “O-Oh...sorry.” I said in a kind of small voice. The now already frustrated looking man rubbed his temples and, after taking some deep breaths, gave me a smile. “I’m very sorry for ruining your daydream, but we have some important matters to attend to. Please, take a seat while I explain.” He said in a bittersweet tone gesturing to a seat I haven’t realized until now.\nAs I sat down, the man already seemed to be ready to explain whatever he wanted to explain. \"Now, I suppose you're here because of a letter I've sent, correct? Now I am not explaining what I meant...yet. I just want to do a measly, little experiment if that's okay?\" I then nodded, now very curious as to what he wanted me to do. \"Alright! Now, I am a neurologist, a person who studies the brain. I am trying to find a solution as to why people get nightmares from their subconscience, rather than their conscience. And, you seemed like the best person for the job. Oh, and if you want to know how, a close friend of yours told me how frequent your nightmares are.\" Joseph, you bastard! How the hell could you tell someone when I told you not to?! \"Now, I don't want to waste anymore precious time, so let's go to the room where this will be conducted.\" He said before pulling me along to the mayhem that was soon to start.\n\nI...don't remember much before the experiment started. I just remember the sharp pain I felt in several parts of my head. And then I was surrounded by darkness. And then I saw my mom washing the dishes. She was speaking to me, but I really couldn't hear what she was saying. Suddenly, my eyes dragged to a door that appeared suddenly. The shape of a man was there, but it wasn't a man. It's skin was leathery and had some deep cuts on its face. And it had a knife in its left hand. My eyes went wide like a deer in the headlights when I knew what it was going to do. My voice couldn't come out when I wanted it to and my body wouldn't move. Even though it was stalking behind her naturally, like it was meant to do this. Right when it was about to chop her head off, that was when my damn body and voice came back to me, \"MOM!!!!!!!\" I yelled until my voice went hoarse... but that didn't help at all. Her head rolled up to my foot. With that same smile of hers.\n\nAnd then I jumped up panting roughly and sweating. Putting myself, it felt like I had my pajamas on. But... I didn't have my pajamas on when I left for the experiment. And then I remembered about my mother and burst out of my room into the kitchen. To my horror, she was dead like in my dreams. When I ran to her body with tears streaming down my face and harsh sobs coming from my mouth, the letter fell to the floor and showed the message inside. It said, \"Nightmares come from your subconscience and subconscience comes from the fears of life.\""}}
