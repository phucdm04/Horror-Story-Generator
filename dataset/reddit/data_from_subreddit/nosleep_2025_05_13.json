I just want someone to tell me I\u2019m not crazy.\n\nI\u2019ve run through every explanation\u2014exhaustion, hallucination, gas exposure\u2014but nothing adds up. I know what I saw in that cave. I know what we heard, and more importantly, what we felt.\n\nYou can say I\u2019m mistaken. That\u2019s fine.\n\nJust don\u2019t tell me it wasn\u2019t real.\n\nIt was my friend Zoe\u2019s idea. She\u2019s always had a reckless streak\u2014urban exploring, off-trail hiking, night diving. I usually talk her down, but this time\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Something about the way she described the cave made me curious.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even on any of the maps,\u201d she\u2019d said. \u201cA guy on the geology forum posted coordinates before his account went dead. Said the wind didn\u2019t blow the same down there.\u201d\n\nI should\u2019ve said no.\n\nWe left early\u2014just two backpacks, headlamps, spare batteries, and a rope line. No cell signal where we were going. The cave entrance was narrow, more of a seam in the rock than a mouth. You had to slide in sideways between slabs of limestone to even reach the chamber.\n\nThe inside was colder than it should\u2019ve been. Still air, like nothing moved in or out.\n\nZoe made a joke about ancient burial grounds. I didn\u2019t laugh.\n\nThere was a dampness to the walls\u2014like sweat, not moisture. The rock was wrong too. It looked like it had been scored with something, thin deep gouges, inconsistent in pattern. Not pickaxe marks. Not natural erosion.\n\nIt looked\u2026 deliberate.\n\nWe went deeper. The light from the surface was long gone, and all we had was the thin white cone of our headlamps. The passage narrowed, then opened into a wide chamber. I remember thinking the ceiling looked too high for how far we\u2019d gone down. Like we were standing in a space that shouldn\u2019t exist.\n\nZoe moved ahead of me, scanning the walls.\n\nThat\u2019s when we found it.\n\nA bundle of bones tied with what looked like human hair, hanging from the ceiling by a crude length of sinew. No carvings. No symbols. Just a mass of bones, gently swaying.\n\nI whispered, \u201cZoe, I don\u2019t think this is abandoned.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t respond right away. When she finally did, her voice was hollow.\n\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t here in the photos.\u201d\n\nPhotos? She hadn\u2019t mentioned any pictures before. I didn\u2019t ask. I was too focused on the smell that was suddenly thick in the air\u2014like meat left in the sun, but sweeter.\n\nThat\u2019s when I heard it.\n\nSomething scraping stone. Not close. Not far. Somewhere in that massive, impossible chamber with us.\n\nI turned, and for a second, I thought I saw something move. Long and thin, almost like a shadow peeled away from the wall and slipped out of sight.\n\nZoe was already backing up. Her face had gone pale beneath the headlamp\u2019s glow. I grabbed her arm and whispered, \u201cWe need to go. Now.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t argue.\n\nWe turned, retraced our steps\u2014but the tunnel didn\u2019t look the same. The gouges in the walls were deeper now. Fresher. Some still wet.\n\nZoe started muttering under her breath.\n\n\u201cI counted it. I counted the turns. I swear I did.\u201d\n\nI told her to keep moving, keep the rope line in hand. But when I reached for it\u2014there was nothing.\n\nThe rope was gone.\n\nJust a frayed end, cut clean.\n\n\nSomething had taken it.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t done with us yet.\n\nZoe was unraveling.\n\nHer breaths were fast and shallow, fogging up the inside of her headlamp lens. I grabbed her by the shoulders\u2014more to steady myself than her.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d I said, quietly but firmly. \u201cWe need to keep our heads. You counted the turns, right? So think. What\u2019s next?\u201d\n\nShe shook her head, eyes wide. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I did count them, I swear\u2014three right, two left, slope downward. But this isn\u2019t where we came in.\u201d\n\nI glanced around. The stone felt tighter somehow. Angrier. The air had thickened, like the cave was exhaling slowly and we were breathing in its rot.\n\nThat smell was stronger now. Clotted. Sickly sweet.\n\nI listened.\n\nThere. Beneath Zoe\u2019s frantic breathing.\n\nBreathing.\n\nNot hers. Not mine.\n\nSomething deep. Rhythmic. A slow drag in and out, not from any one direction\u2014just around us. Embedded in the walls. Or beneath them.\n\nI shushed her and held my hand out. She went quiet.\n\nWe both heard it then.\n\nNot a growl. Not a snarl. Just\u2026 breath.\n\nLike lungs the size of the room, expanding in time with our fear.\n\nI scanned the area. \u201cThere\u2014look,\u201d I whispered. About ten feet up, there was a narrow ledge\u2014natural rock, slanted inward like a lip above the tunnel mouth.\n\nIf we could get up there, maybe we\u2019d get a better view of the layout. Or at least feel like we weren\u2019t being watched from every direction.\n\nI helped Zoe climb first, boosting her from below. Her boots scraped and kicked loose gravel, and I winced with every sound. My turn was harder\u2014my fingers trembled against the sharp stone, my legs aching from tension and cold\u2014but I made it.\n\nThe ledge was wide enough for us to crouch. Our lights reached further up here.\n\nThat\u2019s when I saw it.\n\nA shape just outside the cone of our beams.\n\nIt was too tall. That was my first thought.\n\nNot like a person. Like someone had been stretched upright\u2014arms long, joints sharp, body so thin you could see where the ribs nearly pierced the skin. Its back was turned. Pale, scabbed flesh stretched tight over its frame. Its head scraped the ceiling.\n\nAnd it was listening.\n\nOne long arm curled out and touched the wall, claw tips dragging across it gently, like it was feeling vibrations through the stone.\n\nMy breath caught.\n\nIt froze.\n\nNo sound. No movement.\n\nThen its head twisted\u2014not turned\u2014twisted, the neck bending like a broken branch, until one sunken, pupil-less socket faced our direction.\n\nIt didn\u2019t blink. It didn\u2019t move.\n\nZoe made a noise\u2014something between a whimper and a choked breath\u2014and I grabbed her mouth just in time.\n\nThe thing tilted its head. Its other hand flexed. Claws like carved antler tips scraped together, click-click-click.\n\nThen it sank back into the dark. Not walking. Melting. The way it moved made me feel wrong inside\u2014like gravity didn\u2019t apply to it the same way.\n\nI didn\u2019t realize I was crying until I tasted salt.\n\nWe sat there for what felt like an hour. Maybe it was minutes. Time felt fake down there.\n\nZoe finally leaned in. Her voice was so quiet I barely heard her.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we found the cave. I think it wanted us to find it.\u201d\n\nThat thought didn\u2019t feel paranoid. It felt true.\n\nThe walls were grooved. The air was still. The bones were arranged. This wasn\u2019t some forgotten tunnel. It was a trap.\n\nBaited with something only the desperate or curious would follow.\n\nI pulled out the backup flashlight and checked our gear. Still had a flare. Half a bottle of water. No rope. One knife.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t stay up here.\n\nWhatever that thing was, it knew now.\n\nWe had to move.\n\nI started to climb back down when I saw something strange in the rock below\u2014thin lines in the stone that looked too symmetrical. Almost like\u2026\n\nScript.\n\nNot in English. Not anything I recognized. Dozens of little carvings etched into the ledge just below where we sat.\n\nEach one a perfect copy of the last.\n\nZoe saw them too. \u201cThat looks like the markings near the\u2014\u201d she stopped herself.\n\nNear the bone bundle. We both knew it.\n\nBelow us, the breathing started again.\n\nBut this time, it wasn\u2019t steady.\n\nIt was excited.\n\nI told Zoe to stay.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t move. Don\u2019t make noise. Don\u2019t shine your light unless you hear me call for you.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t argue. Just nodded with that hollow, hunted look. Her hands gripped the rock until her knuckles went white.\n\nI climbed down from the ledge and slipped into the corridor on the far side\u2014one we hadn\u2019t seen before. It felt older than the rest. The walls here were darker, like the stone itself had been scorched. Not from fire\u2026 from time. Or something older than time. My boots crunched something brittle beneath them. I didn\u2019t look down.\n\nThe deeper I moved, the warmer it got.\n\nNot physically. That\u2019s not the right word.\n\nIt was like the space remembered heat\u2014a stale, decaying warmth that stuck to your skin like grease. I turned a corner and found another chamber.\n\nThis one was smaller. Oval-shaped. The walls weren\u2019t stone anymore, at least not naturally. They were carved into reliefs\u2014figures I didn\u2019t recognize, arranged in circles, each with their heads bent toward the center.\n\nIn the middle of the room was a pit.\n\nI don\u2019t know how deep it went. My light couldn\u2019t reach the bottom. But I could hear it. Something moving down there. Slow. Wet. Rhythmic.\n\nIt didn\u2019t echo.\n\nI backed out before whatever was down there noticed me.\n\nWhen I returned to the ledge\u2014\n\nZoe was gone.\n\nNo blood. No drag marks. No scuffle. Just gone.\n\nExcept\u2026\n\nThere was a new bone bundle.\n\nHanging from the rock just below where we had been sitting.\n\nFresh.\n\nNot skeletal. Not cleaned. Something wet still clung to the twine holding it together.\n\nI didn\u2019t scream. I didn\u2019t cry. I couldn\u2019t. My body locked up, my mind flooded with one thought that repeated over and over:\n\nIt took her.\n\nMy flashlight flickered. Not out. Just dimmed. The way a dying memory does in the back of your mind when something older pushes forward.\n\nI ran.\n\nI don\u2019t remember the path I took, only that the cave shifted around me. The same hallway split and doubled back. I saw my own footprints over and over again.\n\nAnd then, I didn\u2019t.\n\nThere were no footprints. No dust. Just smooth stone, as if nothing\u2014and no one\u2014had ever walked there before.\n\nWhen I finally collapsed, I was staring up at a patch of sky. Pale morning light filtered through a hole barely large enough to crawl through. Roots hung like fingers.\n\nI pulled myself out with everything I had left.\n\nI don\u2019t remember how I got back to the car. Or how I drove. I woke up in my apartment two days later, dehydrated and covered in scrapes.\n\nZoe\u2019s things were still in the trunk.\n\nShe\u2019s never been reported missing. No records. No digital footprint. It\u2019s like she was erased the moment we stepped into that place.\n\nExcept\u2026\n\nYesterday, someone slid something under my door.\n\nA strip of pale leather.\n\nTied around a bundle of hair.\n\nZoe\u2019s.\n\nI recognized the braid.\n\nThere were markings burned into the leather. Same as the carvings in that cave. I\u2019ve spent hours trying to match them to anything\u2014runic scripts, tribal symbology, ancient languages. Nothing matches exactly.\n\nBut one symbol keeps showing up.\n\nIt looks like a figure bent backward over a ring of thorns.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s drawn with antlers.\n\nSometimes it has no face.\n\nSometimes\u2026 it looks like it\u2019s smiling.\n\nI\u2019m not posting this for clout. I don\u2019t care if anyone believes me.\n\nI\u2019m posting it because I found something else burned into the inside of the leather.\n\nNot in ancient script.\n\nIn English.\n\nFive words:\n\n\u201cYOU WERE MEANT TO WATCH.\u201d\n\nI haven\u2019t slept since.\nAnd I\u2019m not sure I should.\nBecause sometimes, just before dawn, I hear breathing in the walls.\n\n"},"3":{"title":"My daughter hasn't blinked in three days.

Insanity would be a\u00a0kinder fate than whatever this is.  \n  \nMy\u00a0eight-year-old\u00a0daughter, Lily, is\u00a0smart.\u00a0Inquisitive.\u00a0A little shy,\u00a0perhaps, but\u00a0always\u00a0energetic. She used to laugh at everything\u2014bad knock-knock jokes, cartoon voices, even the\u00a0wash machine\u00a0sound the\u00a0washer\u00a0produced\u00a0when it\u00a0went\u00a0out of\u00a0balance. I hadn't heard that laugh in over a week.  \n  \nBut the blinking thing\u2014it started three days ago. Or\u00a0perhaps\u00a0that's just when I\u00a0realized. I picked her up from school, asked\u00a0her\u00a0how\u00a0she\u00a0was\u00a0doing, and she\u00a0answered\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0flat\u00a0tone\u00a0like none I'd ever heard, \"It was fine. The bell rang too many times.\"  \n  \nI didn't know what to\u00a0do\u00a0with\u00a0that. What does that even mean?  \n  \nThat night, at dinner, I caught myself staring at her. Not because of anything she'd\u00a0said\u2014she\u00a0hadn't\u00a0said\u00a0much\u2014but because her eyes were just open. Wide,\u00a0shiny, unblinking. I watched her\u00a0spear\u00a0mashed potatoes into her mouth with\u00a0mechanical\u00a0precision, never once\u00a0looking\u00a0away from\u00a0that glassy stare.  \n  \n\"Lily, are your eyes bothering you?\"  \n  \n\"No.\"  \n  \n\"Do you need drops? They look dry.\"  \n  \n\"No.\"  \n  \nI blinked. She didn't.  \n  \nThat night, I went to check on her, expecting\u00a0that\u00a0she\u00a0would\u00a0be sleeping.\u00a0She was\u00a0in the\u00a0center\u00a0of her room\u00a0instead. In the dark. Her arms\u00a0loose\u00a0at her sides. Her head\u00a0slightly\u00a0lifted\u00a0up\u00a0as if\u00a0she\u00a0were\u00a0listening to something I couldn't hear.  \n  \nHer eyes were open.  \n  \n\"Sweetheart?\"  \n  \nShe didn't move.  \n  \nI\u00a0moved\u00a0closer.\u00a0Quietly. I swear, I wasn't trying to scare her\u2014but she\u00a0still\u00a0responded.  \n  \nShe\u00a0swiveled\u00a0around\u00a0to\u00a0face\u00a0me, but not\u00a0altogether.\u00a0First\u00a0her eyes. Then her head. Then\u00a0the rest of\u00a0her, with a sickening\u00a0lag,\u00a0as\u00a0if\u00a0I was\u00a0seeing\u00a0her\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0internet. And then she smiled.  \n  \nOnly\u00a0it wasn't her smile.  \n  \n\"Go back to bed, Daddy,\"\u00a0she\u00a0told me.\u00a0\"You're still not ready.\"  \n  \nHer voice was too\u00a0level. Too\u00a0steady. Lily has\u00a0the\u00a0tiniest\u00a0lisp. This\u00a0one\u00a0did not.  \n  \nI\u00a0stepped\u00a0away\u00a0from\u00a0the room. Closed the door. Didn't sleep.  \n  \nDay two was worse.  \n  \nShe\u00a0did\u00a0not\u00a0attend\u00a0school. I told the office she had a stomach\u00a0virus.\u00a0The\u00a0real reason, I didn't want her around other kids. I didn't want her around anyone. I just wanted to figure out what the\u00a0devil\u00a0was happening.  \n  \nBut every time I looked at her, she was already looking\u00a0back\u00a0at me.  \n  \nI caught her\u00a0staring\u00a0from the hallway mirror. From the crack\u00a0of\u00a0my bedroom door. From behind the\u00a0drapes in the\u00a0living room.  \n  \nShe'd appear in rooms\u00a0that\u00a0she hadn't entered. I\u00a0ceased\u00a0to\u00a0hear\u00a0her footsteps. I\u00a0ceased\u00a0to\u00a0hear\u00a0her\u00a0breathing.  \n  \nBut I saw her.  \n  \nAt\u00a0lunchtime, I was in the kitchen, pretending to cook. I looked up and saw her standing in the\u00a0yard,\u00a0bare feet,\u00a0gazing\u00a0at\u00a0the kitchen window. She\u00a0did\u00a0not\u00a0blink.  \n  \nA few minutes later, I heard her voice behind me.  \n  \n\"I brought the bell inside,\"\u00a0she said.  \n  \nI turned. She wasn't wet. She wasn't muddy. She hadn't opened the back door. And she was holding something wrapped in newspaper. I didn't want to open it. I didn't need to.  \n  \nThat night, I tried to test her.  \n  \nI\u00a0flashed\u00a0flashcards.\u00a0I\u00a0lit up harsh\u00a0lights. I\u00a0blared\u00a0ear-piercing\u00a0noises. I showed her that\u00a0notorious\u00a0viral video of the girl\u00a0jump-scared by the mirror ghost.  \n  \nNothing.  \n  \nHer eyes\u00a0didn't\u00a0budge.  \n  \nI\u00a0aimed\u00a0a flashlight directly into them.  \n  \nNo reaction. No\u00a0weeping. No\u00a0dilation\u00a0of pupils.  \n  \nShe\u00a0breathed softly:\u00a0\"You'll lose if you keep playing.\"  \n  \nI\u00a0have\u00a0no\u00a0idea\u00a0what that\u00a0was. I still don't.  \n  \nBy the third night, I\u00a0had\u00a0lost\u00a0nearly 60 hours\u00a0of\u00a0sleep. I sat in the hallway outside her door with a bottle of wine and a kitchen knife\u00a0that\u00a0I\u00a0had\u00a0no\u00a0idea how I'd come to pick up. I\u00a0left\u00a0the lights off. I didn't want her to see me.  \n  \nShe did.  \n  \nShe\u00a0stood\u00a0outside\u00a0her\u00a0door\u00a0at\u00a0precisely\u00a0midnight,\u00a0sneaked\u00a0into the hallway, and\u00a0knelt\u00a0down beside me.  \n  \n\"You look\u00a0sleepy,\"\u00a0she said.  \n  \nI didn't answer.  \n  \n\"Do you want to stop blinking, too?\"  \n  \nI\u00a0had\u00a0shaken\u00a0my head.  \n  \n\"It's okay,\"\u00a0she\u00a0had\u00a0whispered.\u00a0\"The thing behind your eyes already said yes.\"  \n  \nAnd\u00a0then she\u00a0had\u00a0touched me. Two fingers,\u00a0pressing\u00a0slowly\u00a0on the skin\u00a0underneath\u00a0my lower eyelids. I\u00a0jerked\u00a0away\u00a0from it, but the pressure\u00a0remained, like the memory of it was\u00a0seared\u00a0underneath\u00a0the surface.  \n  \nThat was yesterday.  \n  \nToday, I can feel it.  \n  \nThe\u00a0burn. The\u00a0itch. The\u00a0watching. Like something is\u00a0huddled\u00a0in\u00a0the back of\u00a0my\u00a0head,\u00a0behind my eyes, stretching, waiting. And she's still\u00a0staring\u00a0at\u00a0me. Standing\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0doorway\u00a0of every room.\u00a0Whistling\u00a0some tune I\u00a0don't\u00a0recognize. Every time I blink\u00a0these days, I\u00a0can\u00a0hear it\u00a0clearer. It's not in my ears\u2014it's\u00a0in\u00a0the back of\u00a0my eyes.  \n  \nLily hasn't blinked in three days.  \n  \nBut neither have I."},"4":{"title":"A woman entered our police station at 3:23am and begged to be arrested.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kky6pw\/a_woman_entered_our_police_station_at_323am_and\/","flair":null,"author":"Theeaglestrikes","selftext":"\u201cWhat crime have you committed?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNone,\u201d she choked out, lungs recovering from her dash into the station.\n\nI frowned from behind the counter, readying myself for one of *those* nights, but it would be like no other night of my life. \u201cThen why should I arrest you, ma\u2019am?\u201d\n\nThe squirrelly woman, catching her breath with hands against her knees, cranked her neck backwards so sharply that the joint popped.\n\n\u201cBecause,\u201d she said, taking a big inhale, \u201cwe\u2019re all in danger.\u201d\n\nThen her eyes began to ping frenetically between the station\u2019s entrance and me.\n\nI leant my elbows a little more deeply into the counter, pushing forwards to take a better peek at the building\u2019s automatic doors.

However, jail cells aren\u2019t hotel rooms, so\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to protect myself,\u201d she interjected with a hiss, wild eyes locking onto mine. \u201c*I need to protect all of you.*\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening out here, Thatcher?\u201d Officer Mandy Bowen asked as she emerged from the office behind me.\n\nI tried my damnedest not to gulp, but the unnerving woman was making it difficult for me. \u201cThis lady is asking to be arrested, but she says she hasn\u2019t committed a crime.\u201d\n\nOfficer Bowen offered me a raised eyebrow, then put her hands on her hips as she looked at the woman. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, love?\u201d\n\n\u201cTamsin,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease will one of you lock me up? I need to be locked up\u2026 Something bad\u2019s about to happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s about to happen, Tamsin?\u201d asked Officer Bowen.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the woman blubbered, placing her face in her hands. \u201c*It\u2019s inside me*.\u201d\n\nSomething about those words, and her tone of voice, instilled me with fear beyond anything words could describe\u2014for it was a fear not of this world.\n\nOfficer Bowen, on the other hand, seemed unamused; she leant towards my ear and whispered, \u201cI think we need to get this lady some psychiatric help.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe might be in danger,\u201d I whispered back as Tamsin continued to cry.\n\n\u201cShe might be,\u201d Officer Bowen agreed. \u201cBut that\u2019s for a healthcare professional to decide, don\u2019t you think? Not two police officers at three o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201d\n\nI nodded, then spoke louder. \u201cTamsin, I\u2019m going to leave you with Officer Bowen for a second whilst I make a call in the office. Okay?\u201d\n\nTamsin shot her head up from her hands as I rose from the swivel chair. \u201cNo, please\u2026 Just arrest me\u2026 There isn\u2019t time for any of this!\u201d\n\n\u201cI need you to relax, Tamsin,\u201d Bowen said as I started to walk towards the office. \u201cWe\u2019re going to help you, okay? We\u2019re going to figure out what\u2019s happening. Together.\u201d\n\nI shut the office door behind me, then made the call. The idea was to avoid potentially upsetting or aggravating the distressed civilian. Bowen and I had no idea how she would react to the arrival of a mental health specialist, so it seemed best to keep that information to ourselves.\n\nThe office overlooked the main entrance through a horizontal one-way window, so I watched Bowen and Tamsin talk whilst the phone rang. And when I made it through to a specialist, I explained the whole situation to her. She said that Tamsin was in need of a proper health assessment.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s late,\u201d I said, \u201cso I\u2019m happy to escort her to the hospital.\u201d\n\nAnd then came a voice not quite her own. \u201c*No, we\u2019ll escort you all*.\u201d\n\nBefore I managed to wrap my head around my unease at her sudden shift in vocal timbre, I clocked Tamsin smiling at me from the other side of the one-way window. She shouldn\u2019t have been able to see me, but I knew, somehow, that she could. And that filled me with terror.\n\nThe grin on her face might\u2019ve have a thing to do with it too.\n\nThen the lights in the station cut out.\n\nAnd that came with a sharper pang of terror; the pain persisted afterwards, leaving me sitting in the dark, phone screen lighting my face, with an invisible blade lodged stubbornly between two bars of my ribcage.\n\nWith the phone in my far-from-rigid hand, I rushed back out into the darkened area behind the counter, but Officer Bowen wasn\u2019t there; and when I shone my phone\u2019s torch beyond the counter, Tamsin wasn\u2019t there either.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d yelled a voice from down the corridor as fear started to grip me more tightly.\n\nA torch light bounced down a distant corridor, beyond the counter, painting the walls in light\u2014offering only a slight reprieve from the suffocating darkness. Then came Officer Patrick Harling into the entryway.\n\n\u201cOh, Thatcher, thank God someone\u2019s here\u2026\u201d he sighed, shining the torch beam onto me. \u201cLooks like we\u2019ve had a power cut.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a woman,\u201d I whispered, leaning against the counter once again\u2014this time, for emotional support; I was terrified, and I still wasn\u2019t quite sure why. \u201cShe\u2019s gone now\u2026 Bowen\u2019s gone too.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Harling asked, not catching my drift. \u201cGone?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 Where\u2019s Rodman?\u201d I asked.\n\nHarling shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re the first person I\u2019ve found. Maybe we should check the fuse box, or call\u2014\u201d\n\nHe was interrupted by screaming\u2014the voices of a man and a woman\u2014from deeper within the station.\n\n\u201cBowen,\u201d I whispered.\n\n\u201cRodman,\u201d he added.\n\nI ran out from behind the counter and joined Officer Harling as we ran down a hallway that led into the heart of the station, desperate to locate the cries of our two fellow officers on the late night shift with us.\n\n\u201cThis is Officer Patrick Harling,\u201d he panted as we ran down the corridor. \u201cRequesting backup. Power cut at the station, and potential disturbance.\u201d\n\n\u201c*Roger*,\u201d came a garbled voice from the other end of his radio.\n\nWe burst through double doors and found ourselves in the station\u2019s break room. There, we witnessed a horror I will never forget.\n\nOfficer Bowen and Officer Rodman were both lying on one of the tables, sawn neatly in half a little above each of their pelvic areas. The light of Harling\u2019s torch caught the sheen of the blood, and the table's laminated plastic top, and the whites of the victims\u2019 eyes; their mouths hung open in the screams they had unleashed during those final seconds of life. I hoped, and still hope, their deaths were swift and relatively painless, but their expressions told another horrifying story\u2014one that left me paralysed in fear, vocal cords unable to expel a sound.\n\nHarling, on the other hand, screamed and rushed towards our severed officers, dropping his torch to the floor as he ran\u2014plunging us back into darkness.\n\nI\u2019d seen something for a moment at the back of the room.\n\n\u201cHarling, pick the torch up,\u201d I begged, rummaging in my pocket for my phone.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re gone\u2026\u201d Harling sobbed, no longer the sturdy officer of the law I had known for five years, but a weeping mess.\n\n\u201cPick it up NOW, Harling,\u201d I insisted.\n\nI was a mess too\u2014a jittery, terrified one. It wasn\u2019t sturdiness that kept me awake and alert. Wasn\u2019t my duty to the law.\n\nI need Harling to pick up his torch because we weren\u2019t alone in that room.\n\nThere came the slaps of flesh against the floor, and I hurriedly activated my phone\u2019s torch.\n\nHarling was gone.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d I wheezed feebly, casting the torch around the room. \u201cWhoever\u2019s in here, reinforcements are on the way, so\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c*Roger*,\u201d crackled a distorted voice from some unseen radio. \u201c*We\u2019ll escort you all.*\u201d\n\nMy stomach dropped as I realised that Harling\u2019s call hadn\u2019t made it through to anyone. That voice, inhuman and indistinct, did not belong to anyone or anything that wanted to help.\n\nIt belonged to the voice I\u2019d heard when I called the mental healthcare professional.\n\nThere came more slaps from behind me. Only a few. And when I spun my torch around, I expected to find nothing there once again.\n\nSo, I screamed when I saw her.\n\n*Tamsin.*\n\nOnly, she had changed\u2014she showed only the whites of her eyes, rolling them ever-deeper into the back of her head, and her mouth was impossible: it spanned the breadth of her face and then some. It had opened beyond human limits.\n\nAnd, to add to that hellishness, it revealed not human teeth, but incisors of obscene length, narrow width. Each tip tapered off to the finest point, which dripped with blood. And even the canines and molars to the sides were unthinkably sharp\u2014unthinkably capable of cleaving a creature neatly down its centre.\n\n\u201c*Do you want me to stay, officer?*\u201d the thing cooed, as if playing with its food.\n\nThen she\u2014it\u2014charged towards me, and I screamed at a volume louder than my lungs were built to accommodate. Screamed as I braced for death.\n\nScreamed, \u201c*NO!*\u201d\n\nTime feels a little hazy between that moment, which I expected to be my last, and the moment at which the responding officers found me.\n\nThey said they\u2019d arrived in twenty minutes, but it may as well have been hours\u2014or perhaps only seconds. But she was gone when they got there and returned power to the building.\n\nI was interrogated about the demise of my fellow officers, including the disappearance of Officer Patrick Harling, who is a suspect in the case\u2014along with Tamsin, the mystery woman visible on CCTV footage before the blackout.\n\n\u201cThe discrepancy between your story and the truth is curious,\u201d said one interviewer.\n\n\u201cWhat discrepancy?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWell, the power to the building was undoubtedly cut,\u201d he explained. \u201cYet, the automatic doors were standing open when backup officers arrived at the station.\u201d\n\nI felt my skin pale.\n\n*He said I\u2019d need permission to* [leave](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dominiceagle)*.*"},"5":{"title":"The Doll My Grandmother Gave Me Keeps Changing Its Face","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kkntux\/the_doll_my_grandmother_gave_me_keeps_changing\/","flair":null,"author":"naspanl","selftext":"When my grandmother died, she left me three things: a ring, a letter I was told never to open, and a porcelain doll named Lily. The doll had always sat on the mantle of her Georgia farmhouse, unmoving and pale, with glassy blue eyes that followed me a little too well when I was a kid. The day after the funeral, the lawyer handed me the box with Lily inside, swaddled in lace and wrapped so tightly it was like someone was trying to keep her from escaping.\n\nI didn\u2019t want it. I didn\u2019t want her.\n\nBut I took her anyway.\n\nAt first, I kept Lily in the box in my closet, unopened, buried beneath a stack of old coats. But the dreams started three days later. I\u2019d wake up in a cold sweat, remembering flashes\u2014white fabric, long halls, wet scratching. Every time I opened my eyes, I\u2019d find the closet door cracked open just an inch more than I remembered.\n\nOn the seventh night, I heard whispering.\n\nNot words. Just breath and rasp.\n\nI finally opened the box.\n\nLily looked the same at first\u2014porcelain skin, delicate features, tiny red lips. But her eyes weren\u2019t blue anymore. They were brown. Exactly like mine.\n\nI thought I was remembering wrong. Dolls are creepy, sure. They play tricks on your brain. I laughed it off, told myself I was sleep-deprived. I put her on a shelf in my office.\n\nShe was facing the wall when I came back the next day.\n\nI didn\u2019t touch her.\n\nThat night, I dreamed of teeth.\n\nNot falling out. Pulling out. One by one, like petals. Every molar wrapped in doll hair. And when I screamed in the dream, I swear I heard her voice echo from my own throat: \u201cAren\u2019t you beautiful now?\u201d\n\nI woke up with hair in my mouth.\n\nI tried getting rid of her. Drove Lily five miles out to a gas station dumpster at 3 a.m. Tossed her in. Came home, took a shower, cried for half an hour.\n\nShe was back on the shelf the next morning. Wearing a different dress.\n\nI called my mom. She went quiet when I asked about the doll.\n\n\u201cShe gave it a face once,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThat\u2019s why I moved out at 15. I told her not to pass it down.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean a face?\u201d\n\nBut the line went dead.\n\nThe letter\u2014the one I was never supposed to open\u2014was in Lily\u2019s lap now.\n\nI don\u2019t remember putting it there.\n\nInside was a single sentence, handwritten in my grandmother\u2019s shaky script:\n\u201cDon\u2019t say yes when she asks what you see.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t sleep. I watched the doll all night. Her mouth twitched just once, right before dawn.\n\nThen she asked:\n\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d\n\nI said nothing.\n\nShe grinned anyway.\n\nNow everything is warping.\n\nMy walls are breathing. Colors smear like wet paint. Time loops. I\u2019ll walk into the kitchen and come out of the bathroom. My reflection moves a second too slow. And Lily\u2014God, Lily\u2014has my childhood face now. Gap-toothed. Dimples. The one from old photos no one ever took.\n\nSometimes I hear my grandma\u2019s voice through her, like she\u2019s wearing her skin inside-out.\n\nSometimes Lily is bigger.\n\nSometimes I\u2019m the one on the shelf, staring out.\n\nThis is the last thing I\u2019m writing before I try to burn her. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll work. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s fireproof or if I even still live in the world where matches exist. But if you ever find a porcelain doll with your face\u2014and she asks what you see\u2014\n\nLie.\n\nAnd never, ever open the letter.\n"},"6":{"title":"Six months ago, I was a taken hostage during a bus hijacking. I know you haven't heard of it.

A group of unconnected travelers, drifting over the rocky plains and the sand dunes of southwest Arizona together, waiting patiently for the cramped bus to arrive at a mutual destination. Ten minutes after we departed, however, the lone hijacker stood up from the seat closest to the door and revealed his weapon. As he did, we found ourselves connected in the worst way possible.\n\nNone of us understood why.\n\nI prayed that kid\u2019s dumb courage could untangle our rapidly entwining fates, changing us back to simply a group of unconnected travelers before something terrible happened. Judging by the demographics of us captives - predominantly under the age of 10 or over the age of 50 - he was the best shot we had.\n\nAnd so I watched, dread hanging heavy in my heart.\n\n*\u201cTake it easy, man. There are children on board. You see that, right? You gotta put the gun down.\u201d*\n\nThe hijacker said nothing in response.\n\nInstead, he coldly shook his head no, leaning his shoulder against a steel pole directly behind the driver for support.\n\nIn his right hand, he held a silver nine-millimeter pistol. In the other, he held something I had trouble identifying. A noisy green box about the size of a matchbook. It ticked like a metronome, beeping rhythmically in his palm every few seconds. Two tubes containing a slightly cloudy, colorless liquid ran from the side of the box, over his wrist, and up into the darkness of the man\u2019s sleeve.\n\nI incorrectly assumed it was a bomb.\n\n*\u201cTurn right at the fork - then, in six miles, turn left,\u201d* a muffled robotic voice cooed from within his jacket pocket.\n\nHe briefly took his eyes off the kid, tilting his head around to say something to the driver.\n\nThen, that lionhearted son of a bitch started sprinting down the aisle.\n\nI understand *why* he believed he could overwhelm the hijacker. Visually, it sort of made sense. Their physiques couldn\u2019t have been more opposite. The kid was in his prime. Muscular, but not so muscular that the weight slowed him down. A youthful fire behind his eyes. He progressed towards his target with a certain predatory grace, like a jaguar prowling in the shade of the underbrush, closing in on injured prey.\n\nThe hijacker, in comparison, looked to be on death\u2019s door.\n\nHe had a pair of dull blue eyes sunken deep in their sockets. Brittle patches of brown hair asymmetrically planted across his scalp, with islands of wilted skin peeking through where the flesh was most barren. The man was downright cadaverous; inhumanly emaciated. Couldn\u2019t have been over ninety pounds soaking wet, and that\u2019s including the weight of his oversized denim jacket and dark black chinos. He was like a stick figure that had been granted life through a child\u2019s dying wish, jumping off the page into a world too harsh for his pencil-drawn proportions, composed of nothing more a torso with sewing needle arms held up by a pair of toothpick legs and a shriveled head dangling on top of it all.\n\nThe only advantage the hijacker had was the gun. Even so, it appeared like he was struggling to hold the pistol upright. His hand barely had the strength.\n\nI suppose the odds felt even.\n\nIn the blink of an eye, the kid had closed the distance. He was quick. Swift but powerful. Maybe he ran cross-country. The hijacker barely had time to react.\n\nHope dug its roots into my chest. I felt my body reflexively rise from my seat. I was only three rows behind the driver.\n\n*The kid will probably need help wrestling the gun away from him,* I thought.\n\nBefore I could even get into the aisle, though, something went wrong.\n\nImpossibly wrong.\n\nHe angled his approach so that his chest collided with the hijacker\u2019s back. I guess he aimed to thread his brawny arms through the man\u2019s armpits, thereby immobilizing him and controlling the direction the firearm was pointed at, to some degree.\n\nBut as soon as he connected with the hijacker\u2019s body, it liquefied. Along with the gun, the ticking box, and his clothes.\n\nI know how it sounds, and it\u2019s OK. You\u2019re allowed to harbor some skepticism.\n\nBear with me and try to keep an open mind.\n\nSo, he melted. His skin tone bled together with the colors of his clothes, pallid beige swirling together with navy and black, homogenizing into earth-colored gelatin that crawled over the kid\u2019s frame. It  practically glided. Creeped over his shoulders, between his legs, around his torso until it was all behind him. Made it look easy.\n\nThen he reformed. De-congealed back into a person. Reintegrated the clothes, the box, and the gun, too.\n\nThe hijacker placed the butt of the gun on the small of the kid\u2019s back, angled it slightly upward, and pulled the trigger.\n\nThree explosions. A crack of thunder in triplicate. Sprays of blood and bone. Screams from the passengers - the high-pitched shrieks of children and the more sonorous wails of their parents. And behind it all, I could still hear the ticking of that tiny box. Slightly faster, but otherwise unbothered by its dissolution and reformation.\n\nI couldn\u2019t look away. Even as that kid fell into a heap, mangled body crumpling to the floor aside the driver, I couldn\u2019t blink.\n\nThe man swung around, panting and sweating like a Great Dane in the summer sun. Tears had welled under his eyes. His gaze darted between the kid\u2019s corpse, the hysterical passengers, and back again. For a moment, his features betrayed remorse.\n\nBut that moment didn\u2019t last.\n\nHis ragged breathing slowed. His face hardened. He straightened himself, and, somehow; he looked taller. It wasn\u2019t by a lot - a few inches maybe - but it was noticeable. Like his reintegration hadn\u2019t been precise, just very approximate.\n\nHe pointed the gun at the crowd and formally introduced himself.\n\n*\u201cMy name is Apollo. Where I need to go isn\u2019t more than an hour down the road. When we get close, I\u2019ll allow one of you to phone the police. \u201d*\n\nThe green box began ticking slightly faster. From every few seconds to every other second. The sound reminded me of a submarine\u2019s radar detecting a rapidly approaching torpedo.\n\n*\u201cMost of you will live as long as you do as I say.\u201d*\n\n\\- - - - -\n\nI\u2019d like to address the elephant in the room. Some of you are probably asking yourselves:\n\n*\u201cIs this real? When did this happen? Why haven\u2019t I heard about it already?\u201d*\n\nTo start, the event I\u2019m describing occurred a little over six months ago.\n\nAs for why you\u2019ve never heard about it, well, that part I\u2019m still figuring out.\n\nBecause of *nobody\u2019s* heard about it. There wasn\u2019t *any* news coverage.\n\nTo my complete and utter shock, not a single outlet reported on a cryptic bus hijacking orchestrated by an unhinged individual that included the death of a male, white, college aged kid, who was killed attempting to be a hero. Hate to sound cynical about the state of American media, but I don\u2019t know *any* news director that wouldn\u2019t look at the story the same way they\u2019d look at a juicy T-bone steak or scantily clad reality TV star.\n\nThey\u2019re positively *ravenous* for this type of thing.\n\nI would know. I used to be a journalist, a damn good one too, until I was blacklisted from the industry for trying to publish an op-ed on the experience.\n\nBut hey, who needs conventional media outlets anymore?\n\nWe live in the age of the internet.\n\n\\- - - - -\n\nApollo spent the next handful of minutes reorganizing us.\n\nMen to the front of the bus, women and children to the back. At the outset, it wasn\u2019t clear which category was safer to be in. Not looking to be gunned down like the kid, we didn\u2019t ask questions: we just all complied with his request. Urgently shuffled past each other like strangers in an airport.\n\nOnce he had five rows of men sequestered up front, Apollo began inspecting them. Looked each one of them up and down with those sunken eyes. All the while, the bus was silent, save for the revving of the engine and the green box, ticking its impatient melody.\n\nSuddenly, the ticking accelerated.\n\nApollo\u2019s eyes widened. He began hyperventilating. Hungry fear bloomed somewhere within him.\n\nHis focus shifted to the road behind us. From his position at the front of the bus, he tilted his head side to side, gaze fixed on a window at the very back of the vehicle.\n\nI turned around in my seat, looked out the same window, and squinted.\n\nBut there was nothing.\n\nInitially, I thought he could see the cops in the distance or something, even though we hadn\u2019t been allowed to call them yet.\n\nNot a single car was behind us. Just the desert at twilight, brake lights intermittently revealing the shrubs and cacti lining the backwoods road we were barreling down. Wherever Apollo\u2019s GPS was taking us, it felt far off the beaten path.\n\nHe seemed paralyzed. Locked in a state of utter panic as the ticking continued its manic song.\n\n*\u201cStop the bus\u2026\u201d* he whispered.\n\nThe driver, an elderly man in a reflective vest and button-up shirt, did not hear the command.\n\n\u201c**STOP THE BUS,**\u201d Apollo roared.\n\nTires screeched. I hadn\u2019t braced for impact, so the side of neck collided awkwardly with the seat in front of me. A toddler a few rows back began sobbing uncontrollably. He had been exceptionally stoic until that point, but the sudden stop had demolished the floodgates, and once the tears started following they didn\u2019t show signs of drying up any time soon.\n\nThe hijacker\u2019s eyes scanned the captives in front of him. Eventually, they landed on a lean man in his mid-forties with salt-and-pepper hair.\n\n*\u201cYou.\u201d* He declared, using the butt of the pistol to indicate who he had selected.\n\n*\u201cStand up. Now.\u201d*\n\nReluctantly, the man got to his feet. A jumbled appeal for mercy streamed from his lips.\n\n*\u201cOkay\u2026hey\u2026listen\u2026I have a d-\u2026I have t-two daughters\u2026one of them\u2026is very\u2026is very sick and\u2026\u201d*\n\nApollo wasn\u2019t listening. His head was down, attention glued to the ticking box. It was hard to tell for certain what *exactly* he was doing. A murky darkness had fallen inside the bus after sunset.\n\nHis hands appeared to be fidgeting with the device. Best I could say, I think he loosened one of the tubes containing the cloudy fluid, dabbed some of it onto his finger, and then wiped it onto the salt-and-pepper man\u2019s forehead.\n\nA profane baptism.\n\nThe cryptic rite only made the captive plead more feverishly.\n\n*\u201cY-You\u2026you\u2026I\u2026please, please\u2026\u201d*\n\n*\u201cGet out.\u201d* Apollo responded firmly.\n\nThe captive tilted his head. His whole body trembled as he just kept repeating the word *\u201cwhat\u201d* over and over again. Nuclear levels of confusion seemed to have completely atomized his brain. I almost expected to see a gray-pink brain soup drip from his ears and onto his cheeks.\n\n*\u201cDriver, open the door. Let this man out.\u201d*\n\nThe door creaked open.\n\nHesitantly, the man moved to the aisle. He sheepishly raised his cell phone for Apollo to see. Words had left him at that point, but he still wanted permission to leave with the technology.\n\nThe ticking intensified. The beeps had become so fast that they almost melded into a single, ear-piercing sound.\n\nApollo\u2019s face tightened from some mix of fury and fear.\n\n*\u201cYes! Yes. Take it. I don\u2019t care. Now get the fuck off the bus.\u201d*\n\nThe man finally seized his opportunity. He raced down the aisle and off the vehicle, tripping over the kid\u2019s corpse in his hurry, nearly falling on top of him as he made his escape.\n\nAs soon as the doors snapped shut, Apollo shouted his next command.\n\n*\u201c****Drive****.\u201d*\n\nThe bus gathered speed. The stunned man disappeared into the blackness, and the singsongy GPS chirped from Apollo\u2019s jacket pocket.\n\n*\u201cContinue straight for another thirty-two miles\u2026\u201d*\n\nThe ticking slowed, and Apollo seemed to calm.\n\n*\u201cYour destination will be on your left.\u201d*\n\n\\- - - - -\n\nApollo expelled four more captives that night. Every time, it was the same.\n\nThe ticking would speed up. A man would be selected, baptised, and then dismissed. Once they had been left behind, swallowed by the night, the ticking would settle.\n\nIt took some detective work, but I\u2019ve determined approximately which road we were driving down. Honestly, it wasn\u2019t as remote as I thought. The nearest town was, give or take, an hour's walk from where most of them had been dropped off.\n\nFive calls were made to the police, reporting the hijacking.\n\nYou want to hazard a guess on how many of them were found?\n\nZero. Zilch. Goose Egg.\n\nAll of them vanished without a trace.\n\nI could understand *one or two* of them becoming lost the wilderness. Killed by a rattlesnake. Or by dehydration. Or heat stroke. The desert isn\u2019t exactly the most hospitable piece of Mother Gaia.\n\nBut *all* of them? What are the odds?\n\nNot only that, but none of their remains have ever been located. Not a single scrap of any of them.\n\nTo say that fact irked me in the weeks that followed would be an understatement. It drove my mind out to the edge of sanity and kicked it from the car, not unlike Apollo did to those men. Left it to fester in that wasteland without a lifeline.\n\nThat said, overtime, I finally started to visualize a perverse logic to it all.\n\nHear me out.\n\nThe men Apollo selected were tall and gaunt. Older. Most of them had brown hair and blue eyes.\n\nI.e. - they all sort of looked like him.\n\nOriginally, I theorized he hijacked the vehicle because he needed help getting to wherever that GPS was leading us.\n\nBut then, why hijack a whole bus full of people? Why not just hijack a taxi? Better yet, why not just call an Uber?\n\nThose options sure would have been simpler.\n\nUnless, perhaps, he was being chased by something, and he was attempting to slow down its pursuit by throwing a few look-a-likes in its way.\n\nYou want to know what I think that mysterious liquid was?\n\nCerebrospinal fluid. Flowing from his spine, to the device, and then back again. The baptism provided a little part of himself to elevate the authenticity of his doppelgangers.\n\nWhich brings me to the most important question. One I still don\u2019t have a satisfactory answer to.\n\nWhat was that device, and why was it ticking?\n\n\\- - - - -\n\n*\u201c****SHOW YOURSELF****\u201d* Apollo screamed.\n\nThe green box was ticking faster than it ever had before, like a snare drum tapping at four hundred beats per minute.\n\nHe waved the gun around wildly at the frightened passengers.\n\n*\u201cPlease\u2026I\u2019m so close. I just need a little more. I can feel it. Why\u2026why stand in the way of my ascension?\u201d*\n\nHe was whimpering, nearly crying again.\n\nEventually, his eyes landed on a young mother sitting aside her son and daughter in the back of the bus.\n\nApollo charged at her with an imperceptible speed, dropping the ticking box from his left hand so he could pull her from the seat. It swung a few inches above the aisle like a clock pendulum as he put the pistol to her head.\n\n*\u201cWhy are you doing this? Haven\u2019t I done* ***enough***?\u201d*\n\n*\u201dHaven't I proven myself ***worthy***\u201d?*\n\nHis interrogation yielded no answers. It only served to rattle the poor woman to the point of absolute malfunction.\n\nMostly, what she said was unintelligible. Her sobs were unrelenting. The syllables had been drowned in a river of tears and mucus before they even had a chance to exit her mouth.\n\nHowever, there was one thing she said that sticks out in my mind. I can hear the words as clear as day.\n\n*\u201cPlease spare me and my son.\u201d*\n\nEvery time she repeated the phrase, I became more and more aware of the subtle discordance within.\n\n*Why wasn\u2019t she mentioning her daughter?*\n\nThat realization had power. Something about it pulled back a veil that was obscuring the presence of an inhuman entity. Subconsciously, I had already peeked behind it, noticing her *\u201ddaughter\u201d* in that seat at all.\n\nNow, though, it was fully open.\n\nAnd when I saw her, or I guess *it*, it saw me back.\n\nThe fake child was crawling up the side of the bus like a tarantula. It skittered across the roof until it was directly above Apollo. All the while, it wasn\u2019t watching where it was going.\n\nIts pure white eyes were fixed squarely on my own.\n\nNo one else seemed to notice it.\n\nIt smiled and slowly pushed a finger to its lips as if to shush me.\n\nMy heart exploded against my ribs. I shook my head *no*. Somehow, I knew what was coming.\n\nDespite everything, I wanted it to give Apollo mercy, an emotion I still don\u2019t completely understand.\n\nBut he was apparently too far gone. His sins were too irredeemable; his transgressions too foul.\n\nAnd his punishment was swift.\n\nIts arm grew like stretched taffy until it connected with the base of Apollo\u2019s skull. His head shot up. He clearly felt it.\n\nThe ticking continued, faster, and faster, and faster.\n\n*\u201cEileithyia\u2026I\u2019m begging you\u2026\u201d*\n\nToo little, too late.\n\nIts fingers dug into Apollo\u2019s skin. A muffled scream and a series of gurgles radiated from his slacked jaw. A symphony of tearing flesh spread through the air, popping bone intermixed with ripping muscle and trickling blood.\n\nEventually, the entity wrenched two separate tubes from the hijacker\u2019s body. One small, one large.\n\nThe small tube was the plastic one that had been carrying the cloudy fluid.\n\nThe large tube was Apollo\u2019s throat.\n\nIt released its grasp, and his corpse slumped to the floor. His skin lost all color, adopting a deep gray tone like uncooked shrimp. Apollo\u2019s features dissolved, too. No eyes, no face, no mouth, no hair. He became a mound of unidentifiable human puddy.\n\nThen, the entity receded from view. Fled into the background like a chameleon changing colors.\n\nBefore it completely disappeared, however, it winked at me.\n\nAnd I can\u2019t stop replaying that moment in my head.\n\n\\- - - - -\n\nWith Apollo dead, everyone rushed off the bus, weeping and broken. I almost followed them.\n\nAlmost.\n\nCall it a hunch, but I knew I needed to look.\n\nTerror swimming through my gut, I stepped out of my seat and tiptoed over to Apollo\u2019s corpse, reached into his jacket pocket, and pulled out his cellphone.\n\nWe had been only two miles from whatever his destination was.\n\nI committed the address to memory, slipped the phone back in his pocket, and raced off the bus.\n\nWhatever the truth is, I know I can find it at that address. Which is why I\u2019ve infiltrated the cult that owns that land. Technology is prohibited on their reserve, so I\u2019m not afraid of them finding my post.\n\nBut I don\u2019t have anyone to say goodbye to, so I made this instead.\n\nIt\u2019s pathetic, I\u2019m aware. Do me a favor though.\n\nIf I don\u2019t make it back, please disseminate this story, and the following words, as far as you can.\n\n*Apollo.*\n\n*Eileithyia.*\n\n*The Audience to his Red Nativity.*\n\nThere\u2019s something horrific looming on the horizon.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the right person to bring it all to light.\n\nBut, hell, I\u2019m going [to try](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/unalloyedsainttrina\/s\/2Z6XgouP8j)."},"7":{"title":"The Whisper in My Bedroom Wasn\u2019t My Girlfriend","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kkjao2\/the_whisper_in_my_bedroom_wasnt_my_girlfriend\/","flair":null,"author":"Eight8Forty40AM","selftext":"I haven\u2019t slept in days, and I\u2019m typing this at 4 AM because I\u2019m too scared to close my eyes. I\u2019m 28, live alone in a rundown apartment with paper-thin walls, and my girlfriend, Mia, stays over a couple times a week. Last Friday, something happened that\u2019s got me questioning my sanity, and I need to tell someone before I lose it completely.\n\nMia came over after work, and we were chilling with some takeout and Netflix. One thing led to another, and we ended up in my bedroom, lights off, getting, uh, intimate. I\u2019m not gonna overshare, but let\u2019s just say we were caught up in the moment, tangled in the sheets, and I was feeling pretty good. The room was dead quiet except for us, or so I thought. Right as things were heating up, I heard a whisper\u2014sharp and cold, right in my ear: \u201cSlow down.\u201d It was so clear I froze, thinking Mia was messing with me. I pulled back, looked at her, and she was staring at me, confused, like, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked if she said anything, and she swore she didn\u2019t. Her face was blank, maybe a little annoyed I stopped. I laughed it off, blaming my imagination, and we kept going, but I couldn\u2019t shake this uneasy feeling.\n\nA few minutes later, it happened again. Another whisper, slower and raspier: \u201cNot like that.\u201d My heart slammed in my chest. Mia didn\u2019t react, still moving with me, so I knew she didn\u2019t hear it. I scanned the room\u2014nothing but shadows and the faint glow of streetlights through the blinds. My stomach twisted, but I didn\u2019t want to freak her out, so I mumbled something about needing a break and got up to check the apartment. Doors locked, windows shut, nobody else here. Mia was pissed, thinking I was dodging her, but I convinced her to stay the night, mostly because I was too spooked to be alone.\n\nAround 2 AM, I woke up to Mia shaking me, her voice trembling: \u201cDid you hear that?\u201d I was groggy, but then I heard it\u2014a low, guttural voice from the corner of the room: \u201cShe\u2019s not yours.\u201d We both screamed, flipped on the light, and there was nothing. No one. Just my shitty IKEA dresser and a pile of laundry. Mia grabbed her stuff and bolted, saying she\u2019s never coming back. I tried to stop her, but she was gone before I could explain.\n\nSince then, it\u2019s gotten worse. Every night, I hear that whisper\u2014sometimes it\u2019s \u201cSlow down,\u201d sometimes it\u2019s my name, drawn out like a hiss. Last night, I felt something cold brush my leg under the covers, and I swear the mattress dipped like someone sat down. I checked my building\u2019s records online. A guy lived here 10 years ago, died in this apartment\u2014heart attack in his sleep, right in this bedroom. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s him, but I\u2019m moving out next week. My lease is up, and I can\u2019t take this anymore. Mia\u2019s not answering my texts, and I\u2019m sleeping on the couch with every light on. Has anyone dealt with something like this? I\u2019m scared it\u2019ll follow me."},"8":{"title":"I got a package every day for a week. I shouldn't have opened them. Now there's a nightly visitor at my door that only I can hear, and the police think I'm crazy.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kkb6rb\/i_got_a_package_every_day_for_a_week_i_shouldnt\/","flair":null,"author":"gamalfrank","selftext":"\n\nIt started exactly one week ago. Last Tuesday. I came home from work \u2013 just a regular day, nothing out of the ordinary \u2013 and there it was, sitting on my doorstep. A small package, about the size of a thick novel, maybe a bit wider. It was wrapped in plain brown paper, the kind you get from a roll. It was sealed very thoroughly with clear packing tape, like someone really didn\u2019t want it to come open accidentally.\n\nThe weird thing was, there was no return address. No stamps. No postmark. Just my address, neatly printed in the center in plain, black, block capital letters. It looked like it had been typed on a label maker, or maybe printed from a computer. It was definitely my address, perfectly correct.\n\nMy first thought was that a neighbor had dropped something off, or maybe a local delivery that didn\u2019t go through the usual channels. I wasn\u2019t expecting anything. I picked it up. It wasn\u2019t particularly heavy, but it felt solid. I shook it gently. Nothing rattled.\n\nI brought it inside, set it on the kitchen counter, and just stared at it for a bit. There\u2019s a certain level of unease that comes with an anonymous package, you know? Especially these days. But it wasn\u2019t ticking, it didn\u2019t look suspicious in that way. It just looked\u2026 blank. Impersonal.\n\nI considered opening it right then, but something held me back. A little niggle of\u2026 I don\u2019t know, caution? Or maybe just the fact that I was tired from work and wanted to unwind. I left it on the counter and mostly forgot about it for the rest of the evening.\n\nThe next day, Wednesday, another one arrived. Identical. Same brown paper, same meticulous taping, same typed label with my address. No return info, no stamps. Just\u2026 there. On my doorstep, waiting for me when I got home.\n\nNow, two is a pattern. This wasn\u2019t a misdelivery or a friendly neighbor anymore. This was intentional. I felt a prickle of anxiety. I picked it up, and it felt exactly the same as the first one. Same size, same weight, same lack of rattling. I placed it next to the first one on the counter. They looked like twins.\n\nMy mind started racing. Was it some kind of weird marketing gimmick? A prank? I asked my immediate neighbors if they\u2019d seen anyone drop anything off. Mrs. Henderson next door, who sees everything, said she hadn\u2019t noticed anything unusual. I even called the local post office, described the packages, and asked if they had any record of a delivery service that might operate this way. The guy on the phone sounded bored and unhelpful, basically told me if it didn\u2019t have postage, it wasn\u2019t their problem. \"Could be a courier, could be anyone,\" he'd mumbled before suggesting I call the non-emergency police line if I was concerned.\n\nThursday. Another package. Same as the others. Now I had three of them lined up on my counter. The anxiety was definitely stronger. This wasn\u2019t funny anymore. It felt invasive. Someone knew where I lived, and they were deliberately, repeatedly, sending me these mute, anonymous things.\n\nI did call the non-emergency line. I explained the situation to the officer who took my call. I tried to keep my voice calm, rational. \"Look, I know it sounds minor,\" I said, \"but it's three days in a row now. Identical packages, no sender info. It's just\u2026 unsettling.\"\n\nThe officer listened, or at least I think she did. She asked if the packages seemed threatening, if I\u2019d been threatened by anyone. I said no, not overtly. They just were. She suggested it was probably a misguided prank, or maybe some company\u2019s bizarre sample distribution. \"You could just\u2026 not accept them?\" she offered, as if I had a choice when they were just left on my doorstep. \"Or throw them away if they\u2019re making you uncomfortable. Unless there\u2019s an actual threat, sir, there\u2019s not much we can do about someone leaving items on your property if they\u2019re not hazardous.\"\n\nHelpful. So helpful.\n\nFriday. Package number four. I actually felt a knot in my stomach when I saw it. I didn\u2019t even want to touch it this time. I nudged it with my foot first, then reluctantly picked it up. Same. Exactly the same. The pile on my counter was growing. It felt like they were watching me.\n\nSaturday. Package number five. I was starting to feel besieged. I wasn\u2019t sleeping well. Every creak in the house made me jump. I kept looking out the windows, hoping to catch whoever was doing this. I even stayed up late on Friday night, watching the porch from the darkened living room, but I must have dozed off because there it was on Saturday morning when I went to get the newspaper.\n\nSunday. Package number six. My weekend was ruined. I barely left the house. I just kept staring at the six packages. They were a silent, oppressive presence in my kitchen. I\u2019d walk past them, and my eyes would be drawn to them. What was inside? Why me? The questions looped endlessly in my head. I thought about taking them somewhere, the police station maybe, and just dumping them on their desk. But what would that achieve? They\u2019d already told me they couldn\u2019t do anything.\n\nI considered opening them, of course. Many times. The curiosity was immense, a burning itch under my skin. But it was mixed with a potent dose of fear. What if it was something horrible? Something dangerous? The not knowing was torment, but the knowing could be worse. My imagination, fueled by lack of sleep and growing paranoia, was conjuring up all sorts of grim possibilities.\n\nAnd then yesterday, Monday, the seventh package arrived.\n\nI saw it from the window as I was making coffee, my hands shaking slightly. Another one. Seven days. A full week. That number, seven, it just\u2026 it felt significant. Ominous, even. Like an ultimatum, or a countdown reaching its end.\n\nI didn\u2019t go to work yesterday. I called in sick. I couldn\u2019t have focused anyway. I spent the day pacing, staring at the seven packages now lined up like grotesque brown bricks. The kitchen felt smaller, the air thicker. I knew, with a certainty that settled deep in my bones, that I couldn\u2019t let this go on. I had to know. The not knowing was eating me alive.\n\nSo, I decided. Last night. I\u2019d wait until it was late, until the world outside was quiet. Then, I would open them. All of them.\n\nThe hours crawled by. I tried to distract myself with TV, with a book, but my gaze kept drifting back to the packages. They seemed to hum with a silent, expectant energy. Or maybe that was just the buzzing in my own head.\n\nFinally, around midnight, I couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. The house was dead silent. The only sound was the frantic thumping of my own heart. I went to the kitchen. The seven packages sat there, accusingly. I took a deep breath, grabbed a utility knife, and picked up the first one \u2013 the one that had arrived last Tuesday.\n\nMy hands were clammy. The tape was tough, layered. It took some effort to cut through it cleanly. I peeled back the brown paper carefully, as if disarming a bomb. Inside, there was a simple, white, unsealed envelope. Standard letter size. My name and address weren't on this inner envelope. It was completely blank.\n\nMy heart hammered against my ribs. I slid my finger under the flap and pulled out what was inside.\n\nIt was a single sheet of plain white paper. A4 size, like printer paper. On it, there was a drawing.\n\nA child\u2019s drawing. Or at least, it looked like one. Done in what looked like black crayon, or maybe a thick marker. It was crude, simplistic. It depicted a house. Two windows, a door, a triangle roof. Simple. But\u2026 it was my house. Unmistakably. The shape of it, the placement of the front window, even the slightly crooked gutter I\u2019ve been meaning to fix. It was my house.\n\nTo the far left of the page, almost at the very edge, was a stick figure. Just a circle for a head, a line for a body, two for arms, two for legs. In one of its stick hands, it held another, smaller line, with a blob of red crayon at the tip. A knife. A bloody knife.\n\nAbove the drawing, at the top of the page, were two words, also seemingly handwritten in that same black marker, in messy block letters: \"DAY 1.\"\n\nI stared at it, a cold dread seeping into me. \"Day 1.\" This was the package from last Tuesday. My house. A stick figure with a bloody knife, far away. What did it mean?\n\nMy breath hitched. I reached for the second package, the one from Wednesday. My fingers fumbled with the utility knife, my movements jerky. I sliced it open, pulled out the identical white envelope, then the single sheet of paper.\n\nAnother drawing. The same house \u2013 my house. The same stick figure, holding the same red-tipped knife. But this time, the stick figure was a little closer to the house. Not dramatically, but noticeably. It was no longer at the very edge of the page. It had moved perhaps an inch or two inward, towards the drawing of my home.\n\nAnd above this drawing: \"DAY 2.\"\n\nA wave of nausea hit me. Oh god. No.\n\nI scrambled for the third package, tearing at the brown paper with frantic energy. Envelope. Paper. Drawing.\n\"DAY 3.\"\nMy house. The stick figure. Closer still. Now it was about a third of the way across the page, marching steadily towards the depiction of my sanctuary. The red on the knife seemed brighter, somehow. More deliberate.\n\nI didn\u2019t need to be gentle anymore. I ripped open the fourth package.\n\"DAY 4.\"\nThe stick figure was halfway to the house. Its crude, featureless circle head seemed to be staring right at the front door. My front door.\n\nMy breathing was shallow, ragged. A whimper escaped my lips. This couldn\u2019t be happening. It was a sick joke. It had to be. But the sheer, methodical commitment\u2026 seven packages, seven days\u2026\n\nPackage five. \"DAY 5.\" The stick figure was now much closer, maybe three-quarters of the way there. It was almost in the yard of the crudely drawn house. The knife it held seemed larger, or maybe it was just my terror magnifying it.\n\nI was shaking uncontrollably now. My hands were slick with sweat. I could barely grip the utility knife. Package number six. The one from Sunday. I slashed it open, not even bothering with the envelope, just ripping the paper out.\n\n\"DAY 6.\"\nThe stick figure. It was practically at the porch steps in the drawing. Looming. Its presence filled that side of the page. The red on the knife was a sickening smear.\n\nOne package left. The one from yesterday. Day seven.\nI hesitated. A part of me, a screaming, terrified part, didn\u2019t want to see it. Wanted to burn them all, to pretend this wasn't happening. But I had to. I had to know how this grotesque storyboard ended.\n\nWith trembling fingers, I picked up the seventh package. It felt colder than the others, heavier, though I knew it was an illusion, a product of my fear. I cut it open. Pulled out the envelope. Pulled out the page.\n\n\"DAY 7.\"\n\nThe drawing. My house. And the stick figure\u2026 it wasn\u2019t just close. It was there. Standing right in front of the door. Its stick arm was raised, the one with the bloody knife. It was positioned as if it was about to knock. Or to slash. Its featureless head was tilted slightly.\n\nI stared at the page, my blood turning to ice. The silence in the kitchen was absolute, save for the roaring in my ears. Day 7. Today. The stickman was at my door. In the drawing.\n\nKNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK.\n\nI screamed. Not a loud scream, more like a choked gasp, a sound ripped from my throat. The sound had come from my actual front door. Three distinct, solid knocks.\n\nMy heart leaped into my throat, threatening to choke me. I stumbled back from the counter, knocking a glass to the floor. It shattered, the sound unnaturally loud in the charged silence. The drawings\u2026 the stickman at the door in the \"DAY 7\" picture\u2026 and now this.\n\n\"Who\u2026 who\u2019s there?\" I managed to call out, my voice a hoarse whisper. I didn\u2019t expect an answer. I didn\u2019t want an answer.\n\nSilence. For a moment, I thought maybe I\u2019d imagined it. The stress, the horrific drawings\u2026\n\nThen it came. Not a voice. Not another knock.\nIt was a tapping.\nTap-tap-tap\u2026 tap-tap\u2026 tap-tap-tap\u2026\n\nIt was light, almost delicate, like fingernails on wood. But the rhythm\u2026 it was a melody. A perverted, skeletal version of a lullaby. Slow, deliberate, chillingly patient. Each tap seemed to resonate through the house, through me.\n\nI was paralyzed. Every horror movie clich\u00e9, every primal fear, it was all real, all crashing down on me. The drawings were a countdown, a warning. And the clock had just struck zero.\n\nThe lullaby tapping continued, a soft, insidious rhythm against the wood of my front door. Tap-tap-tap\u2026 tap-tap\u2026 tap-tap-tap\u2026 Over and over.\n\nMy mind, finally jolted out of its frozen terror by a surge of adrenaline, screamed one word: Police!\n\nI fumbled for my phone, which I\u2019d thankfully left on the counter. My fingers were clumsy, slick with sweat. I almost dropped it. I dialed 911, my breath coming in ragged gasps.\n\n\"911, what\u2019s your emergency?\" The operator\u2019s voice was calm, professional, a stark contrast to the chaos erupting inside me.\n\n\"Someone\u2019s\u2026 someone\u2019s at my door,\" I stammered, trying to keep my voice from cracking. \"They\u2019re trying to get in. I think\u2026 I think they\u2019re dangerous.\"\n\n\"Okay, sir, what\u2019s your address?\"\n\nI gave it to her, my eyes darting between the kitchen doorway, which led towards the front hall, and the drawings spread out on the counter. The \"DAY 7\" drawing seemed to mock me.\n\n\"Is the person still there, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes! Yes, I can hear them. They\u2019re\u2026 tapping. Like a song.\" My voice was trembling so badly I could barely form the words. \"Please, hurry. I got these\u2026 these packages\u2026 they showed this happening.\"\n\n\"Sir, I need you to stay on the line with me. Are you in a safe location in the house? Can you lock yourself in a room?\"\n\n\"I\u2019m in the kitchen. The front door is\u2026 it\u2019s locked, but\u2026\" But what if a lock wasn\u2019t enough? What if the stick figure wasn\u2019t bound by normal rules?\n\nThe tapping stopped.\nThe silence that followed was somehow worse. Pregnant. Expectant.\n\n\"Sir? Are you still there?\" the operator asked.\n\n\"Yes\u2026 yes. The tapping\u2026 it stopped.\" My voice was barely audible.\n\n\"Okay, officers are on their way. They should be there in approximately five minutes. Can you see the front door from where you are?\"\n\n\"No, not directly.\" The layout of my house meant the kitchen was towards the back. \"But I\u2019m not going near it.\"\n\nThe operator tried to keep me calm, asking questions, but my attention was fractured. Every shadow seemed to move. Every tiny sound the house made \u2013 the settling of wood, the hum of the refrigerator \u2013 sounded like a footstep, a breath.\n\nThose were the longest five minutes of my life. I clutched the phone, staring at the drawings. The progression. The relentless approach. It was so methodical. So patient.\n\nThen, finally, I heard it: the blessed sound of sirens in the distance, growing closer. A wave of relief, so potent it almost buckled my knees, washed over me.\n\nSoon, there were flashing blue and red lights painting my windows. I heard car doors, voices outside. Then, a firm, authoritative knock. \"Police! Open up!\"\n\nThis time, I almost ran to the door. I fumbled with the deadbolt and chain, my hands still shaking, and threw it open. Two officers stood there, expressions serious, hands near their holsters.\n\n\"Are you okay, sir?\" one of them asked, his eyes scanning past me into the house.\n\n\"I\u2026 I think so. They were here. At the door,\" I babbled, ushering them in. \"The knocking, the tapping\u2026 I got these packages\u2026\"\n\nI led them to the kitchen, my words tumbling out in a jumbled mess as I tried to explain the week of anonymous deliveries, the decision to open them, the horrifying drawings. I pointed to the seven sheets of paper laid out on the counter.\n\nThe officers exchanged a look. One of them, older, with tired eyes, leaned down to examine the drawings. He picked up \"DAY 1,\" then \"DAY 7,\" his expression unreadable. The other, younger, walked through the ground floor, checking windows and the back door.\n\n\"Everything secure, no sign of forced entry,\" the younger officer reported when he returned.\n\nThe older officer looked at me. \"Sir, when we arrived, there was no one at your door. We checked the perimeter of your house as we approached. No one.\"\n\n\"But\u2026 I heard them!\" I insisted, my voice rising with a new kind_of panic. \"The knocking, the tapping lullaby! It was right there!\"\n\n\"We understand you\u2019re upset, sir,\" the older officer said, his tone carefully neutral. \"These drawings are\u2026 disturbing, I\u2019ll grant you. Could be some kind of very elaborate, very cruel prank.\"\n\n\"A prank?\" I felt a surge of frustration. \"This isn't a prank! This thing was at my door!\"\n\n\"We have a street-facing camera down at the corner,\" the younger officer interjected. \"It sometimes catches activity on this block. We can check the footage from the time you called, see if anyone was approaching or leaving your property.\"\n\nA small flicker of hope. \"Yes, please. You\u2019ll see.\"\n\nThey called it in. We waited. The kitchen felt cold again, the adrenaline ebbing away, leaving me exhausted and raw. The older officer asked me more questions \u2013 if I had any enemies, any recent disputes, anyone who might want to frighten me this badly. I couldn\u2019t think of anyone. My life is\u2026 quiet. Normal. Or it was.\n\nAfter about twenty minutes, the younger officer\u2019s radio crackled. He listened, then looked at me, then at his partner. His expression was\u2026 strange. Not quite pity, not quite skepticism.\n\n\"Well?\" I urged.\n\nHe cleared his throat. \"Dispatch reviewed the camera footage from the last half hour. There\u2019s no one, sir. Nothing. No one approached your door, no one was on your porch. The street was empty at the time you made the call.\"\n\nThe words hit me like a physical blow. No one. The camera showed no one.\nBut I\u2019d heard it. The knocking. The tapping. It was real. I know it was.\n\nThe officers were sympathetic, in that professional, detached way. They suggested I might have been under a lot of stress, that the drawings had understandably freaked me out. They implied I might have imagined the sounds, my mind playing tricks on me after such a disturbing discovery. One of them even gently suggested I might want to talk to someone, a doctor, maybe.\n\nThey documented the drawings, took my statement. They said they\u2019d file a report for harassment, but without a suspect, without any physical evidence of someone actually being there\u2026 there wasn\u2019t much more they could do. They assured me I was safe. They even did an extra patrol around the block before they finally left.\n\nI locked the door behind them, the multiple locks clicking into place with a sound that offered zero comfort. Safe. They said I was safe. But I didn\u2019t feel safe. I felt more exposed, more vulnerable than ever. If there was no one there, then what had I heard? What was tormenting me?\n\nI gathered the seven drawings, my hands still trembling. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to throw them away. They were evidence, even if only I believed it. I put them back in their envelopes, then back in the brown paper wrappers, and tucked the whole terrible collection into a drawer, as if hiding them would hide the truth.\n\nI didn\u2019t sleep at all last night. I sat in my living room, in the dark, listening. Every creak, every groan of the house settling, was the prelude to that knock, that tapping. But it didn\u2019t come.\n\nUntil tonight.\n\nIt\u2019s now\u2026 just after midnight. The same time I opened the packages last night. The same time the knocking started.\nAnd it\u2019s happening again.\n\nAs I\u2019m typing this, I can hear it.\nKNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK.\nFrom the front door. Clear as day. Or, clear as night.\n\nMy heart is a frantic bird in my chest. I called out, \"Who\u2019s there?\" just like last night. My voice was a pathetic, shaky thing.\nNo answer. Just silence for a beat.\nAnd then\u2026\nTap-tap-tap\u2026 tap-tap\u2026 tap-tap-tap\u2026\n\nThe lullaby. It\u2019s back. Fingernails on wood, a delicate, horrifying rhythm.\nI know if I call the police, they\u2019ll find no one. The cameras will show nothing. They\u2019ll think I\u2019m crazy. Maybe I am.\n\nBut that tapping\u2026 it\u2019s real. I\u2019m listening to it right now. It\u2019s soft, persistent. It\u2019s not demanding entry. It\u2019s just\u2026 there. Reminding me.\nThe stick figure from Day 7 might not be physically standing on my porch. But something is. Something invited by those drawings, or something that sent them.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m trapped in my own home, terrorized by a sound no one else can verify.\n\n"},"9":{"title":"I worked at a haunted mental hospital","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kkcbm7\/i_worked_at_a_haunted_mental_hospital\/","flair":null,"author":"Mother-Midnatt","selftext":"I\u2019m a retired psychiatrist. Back in the late 80s and early 90s I worked at a particular mental hospital, before it was closed due to the psychiatry reform. Most of the time I don\u2019t think about what I saw there at all, but last night I had a nightmare about the fire. My granddaughter asked me about it, and when I told her a few carefully selected stories, she suggested I share my story online.\n\nAnyways, I think the first one I remember was being in a meeting room with a new patient, we can call him Erik. He was sitting opposite of me, slouched in the chair and sullen, with intense eyes and his hands cuffed to the table. I remembered from reading the old notes about him that he had been deemed incapable of standing trial after he murdered his sister\u2019s father-in-law, but strangely any notes about his diagnosis seemed to not have made it into his paperwork.\n\nHe was lean, on the verge of being gaunt, and even without knowing why he was at the hospital, I could feel danger rolling off of him. Mind, he wasn\u2019t the first killer I\u2019ve worked with, so while he was a bit unnerving, I knew how to handle him.\n\nWhen asking him about his family he kept to short answers, though I got the impression that the only one he had really been close to was his sister, with his father an abusive drunk. She was a couple of years older than him, and married their well-off neighbour's son. He also kept rather quiet as to why he\u2019d killed his father-in-law, staring at me with a gaze that held a flickering flame as he asked why it even mattered.\n\nDuring the meeting I started feeling really warm, like the ventilation system wasn\u2019t working, and I smelled something acrid, like smoke. At first it was faint and I dismissed it entirely. And then I started asking Erik about his childhood in more detail.\n\n\u201cFor these questions,\u201d I told Erik, trying to keep an even and calm tone, \u201cI\u2019m not trying to judge you. I\u2019m here to listen and help you, not judge.\u201d He snorted derisively and rolled his eyes. Not at me personally, it seemed, thankfully, so I pushed on. \u201cWhen you were younger, did you set any fires? Did you hurt anyone or anything\u2014animals, younger children?\u201d\n\nHe glared at me, the heat flaring up, with him almost looking outlined in a strange orange-red glow.\n\n\u201cYou think I hurt young ones? Never!\u201d He tugged on the cuffs that kept him bound to the table, and on his skin a sheen of sweat as the scent became more powerful. \u201cAll I did\u2014everything I\u2019ve done\u2014was to protect \u2026\u201d His words faded into a crackling of fire as smoke billowed around the table, and coughing I looked away.\n\nWhen I looked back, I was in my office. In front of me lay a folder from the archives, slightly smoke damaged with a bit of charring on the edge, and as I gingerly opened it, a sepia photo of Erik met my eyes.\n\nThe fire I mentioned? It took place in the 40s. No one figured out how it started, but several patients died and it led to the authorities investigating how the hospital was ran. He had died there. Buried on the mainland. And still, it seemed, like so many others \u2026 he hadn\u2019t left the hospital."},"10":{"title":"The app showed me memories that weren\u2019t mine.

I Think It's Radioactive.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kkd9ke\/theres_a_new_payphone_in_my_town_i_think_its\/","flair":null,"author":"A_Vespertine","selftext":"There was a new payphone in town, at least if you believe what some anonymous conspiracy theorist had posted on the internet. Someone on the local paranormal forum had posted photos of a payphone which, to be fair, was in fairly decent condition, and they had insisted it had been installed recently. More likely than not, it had been there for decades, and neither the poster nor anyone else had noticed it until recently. I\u2019m pretty sure the only people who pay those things any mind anymore are kids who genuinely don\u2019t know what they are or what they\u2019re for.\n\nBut the poster remained quite adamant that this particular payphone was a new addition, his only evidence being some low-resolution screenshots from Google Street View from the approximate location he was talking about, none of which showed the phone. Even granting that the phone was new, that still didn\u2019t make it paranormal, and the guy wasn\u2019t really making a very coherent argument about why it was. He just kept rambling on about how the phone would only work if you put in a shiny FDR dime minted prior to 1965, when they were still made from ninety percent silver. \u00a0\n\nHe said, \u2018Give it silver, and you\u2019ll see\u2019.\n\nWhen he refused to elaborate on exactly how he figured out that the phone would only work with old American coins, everyone pretty much just assumed he was full of it, and the thread fizzled out. But I just so happened to have a coin jar filled with interesting coins that I\u2019ve found in my change over the years, and it only took a moment of sorting through them before I found a US dime from 1963.\n\nI honestly couldn\u2019t think of any better way to spend it.\n\nI decided to check out the phone just after sunset, in the hopes there wouldn\u2019t be too much traffic that might make it difficult to make a phone call. It was right where the post had said it would be, and as I viewed it with my own eyes, I was instantly convinced that I would have noticed it if it had been there before. The thing was turquoise, like some iconic household appliance from the 1950s. Its colour and its pristine condition clashed so much with the surrounding weathered brick buildings that it would have been impossible not to notice it.\n\nStanding in front of it, I could see that there was a logo of a cartoon atom in a silver inlay beneath the name *Oppenheimer\u2019s Opportunities* in a calligraphic lettering. Beneath the atom was an infinity symbol followed by the number 59, which I assumed was supposed to be read as Forever Fifty-Nine.\n\nIt had to have been a modern-day recreation. There was no way it could have been over sixty-five years old and still look so good. It had a rotary dial, as was befitting its alleged time period, beneath which was a small notice that should have held usage instructions, but instead held a poem.\n\n\u201cIf It\u2019s Gold, It Glitters\n\nIf It\u2019s Silver, It Shines\n\nIf It\u2019s Plutonium, It Blisters\n\nWon\u2019t You Please Spare A Dime?\u201d\n\nThat at least explained how the original poster figured out he needed silver dimes to operate the thing, and why he didn\u2019t just come out and say it. I\u2019m not sure I would have gone looking for something that might give me radiation burns. I briefly considered leaving and possibly coming back with a Geiger counter, but I figured there was no way this thing was the demon core or the elephant\u2019s foot. I also didn\u2019t have the slightest idea where to get a Geiger counter, and by the time I found one, it was entirely possible that the phone would be gone before I got back. I wasn\u2019t willing to let this opportunity slip through my fingers. Even if the phone was radioactive, brief exposure couldn\u2019t be that bad, right?\n\nI gingerly reached out and grabbed the receiver, holding it with a folded handkerchief for the\u2026 radiation, I guess (shut up). \u00a0It was heavy in my hand, and even through the handkerchief, I could feel it was ever so slightly warm. It was enough to give me an uneasy feeling in my stomach, but I nevertheless slowly lifted it up to my ear to see if there was a dial tone. I was hardly surprised when it was completely dead. After testing it a bit by spinning the dial or tapping down on the hook, I put a modern dime in just to see what it would do. Unsurprisingly, nothing happened.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nSo, with nothing left to lose, I dropped my silver dime into the slot and waited to see what would happen.\n\nAs the dime passed through the slot with a rhythmic metallic clinking, I could feel soft vibrations as gears inside the phone whirred to life, and the receiver greeted me with a melodic yet unsettling dial tone. I would describe it as \u2018forcefully cheery\u2019, like it had to pretend that everything was wonderful, even though it was having the worst day of its life. It was a sensation that sank deeply into my brain and lingered for long after the call had ended.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThank you for using Oppenheimer\u2019s Opportunities Psychotronic Attophone!\u201d an enthusiastic, prerecorded male voice greeted me, sounding like it had come straight out of the 1950s. \u201cHere at Oppenheimer\u2019s, our mission is to preserve the promise of post-war America that the rest of the world has long turned its back on. A promise of peace and prosperity, of nuclear power too cheap to meter and nuclear families too precious to measure. A world where everyone had his place and knew his place, a world where we respected rather than resented our betters. We\u2019re proudly dedicated to bringing you yesterday\u2019s tomorrow today. You were promised flying cars, and at Oppenheimer\u2019s Opportunities, we\u2019ve got them. We\u2019d happily see the world reduced to radioactive ashes than fall from its Golden Age, which is why for us, year after year, it\u2019s forever fifty-nine!\n\n\u201cPlease keep the receiver pressed firmly against your ear for the duration of the retuning procedure. We\u2019re honing in on the optimal psychotronic signal to ensure maximum conformity. Suboptimal signals can result in serious side effects, so for your own sake, do not attempt to interrupt the signal. If at any point during the procedure you experience any discomfort, don\u2019t be alarmed. This is normal. If at any point during the retuning procedure you would like to make a phone call, we regret to inform you that service is currently unavailable. If at any point you would like the retuning procedure to be terminated, you will be a grave disappointment to us. For all other concerns, please dial 0 to speak to an operator.\n\n\u201cThank you once again for using Oppenheimer\u2019s Opportunities Psychotronic Attophone! Your only choice in psychotronic retuning since Fifty-Nine!\u201d\n\nThe recording ended abruptly, replaced with the same insidiously insipid dial tone as before. I started pulling the receiver away from my ear, only to be struck by a strange sense of vertigo. Everything around me started spinning until my vision cut out, refusing to return until I placed the receiver back against my ear. \u00a0\n\nWhen I was able to see again, the scene around me had changed into the silent aftermath of a nuclear attack. No, not just an attack; an apocalypse.\n\nNot a single building around me was left intact. Everything was toppled and crumbling and tumbling to dust, dust that I could feel fill my lungs with every breath. The air was thick, gritty, and filthy, and I was amazed that it was still breathable at all. It didn\u2019t smell rotten, because there was no trace left of life in it. It was dead, dusty air than no one had breathed in years. Radiation shadows from the victims caught in the blast were scorched into numerous nearby surfaces, many of which still bore tattered propaganda posters that were barely legible through the haze.\u00a0 The city had been bombed to hell and back, and no effort at cleanup or reconstruction had been made. It had been abandoned for years, if not decades, and yet there was no overgrowth from plants reclaiming the land. Nothing grew here anymore. Nothing could. The sky above was a strange, shiny canopy of rippling clouds, illuminated only by a distant pale light.\u00a0\n\nSomehow, I knew that radioactive fallout still fell from those clouds even to this day.\u00a0 Long ago, hundreds of gigatons of salted bombs had blasted civilization to ruins in a day while sweeping the earth in apocalyptic firestorms, throwing billions of tonnes of particulates high up into the atmosphere. Now, all was silent, except for that intolerable psychotronic dial tone, and the insidiously howling wind.\n\nOnly when I realized that those were the only sounds did I realize that they were perfectly harmonized with one another.\n\nI looked up into the sky, at the ash clouds that should have washed out long ago, and I realized it wasn\u2019t the wind that was howling. It was them. The ripples in the clouds were constantly forming into screaming and melting faces before dissipating back into the ash. I was instantly stricken with dread that they might notice me, and I wanted so desperately to flee and cower in the rubble, but I was completely unable to move my feet. I wasn\u2019t even able to pull the phone away from my ear.\n\nSo I did the only thing I could. Summoning all the strength and will that I could manage, I slowly lifted my free hand, placed my index finger into the smoothly spinning rotary, and dialled zero.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d came the same voice as before, though this time it sounded much more like a live person than a recording. \u201cThis isn\u2019t real. Not for you, and not for us. You just needed to see it. Nuclear annihilation is an existential fear no one ever knew before the Cold War, and it\u2019s one that\u2019s been far too quickly forgotten. One can never be galvanized to defend a world in decline the same way they would a world under attack. A world rotting from within invites disillusionment, dissent, and despair. A world facing an external threat forces you to fight for it, to love it wholeheartedly, warts and all. Without the threat of annihilation, every crack in the sidewalk is compared to perfection, and we bemoan the lack of a utopia, as if that were something we were entitled to and unjustly denied. When you see the cracks in the sidewalk, don\u2019t think of utopia. Think of what you\u2019re seeing now. Think of how terrifyingly close this came to reality, and how terrifyingly close it still is. And yet, you must not let the terror keep you from aspiring to greater things, as the fear of nuclear meltdowns, radioactive waste, and Mutually Assured Destruction stunted the progress of atomic energy in your world. The instinct to fear fire is natural, but the drive to understand and tame it is fundamental to humanity and civilization. Decline is born of complacency as easily as it is from cynicism. You must love and fight for both the present and the future. Do you understand yet, or do I need to turn the Attophone up another notch?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2026 what are they?\u201d I managed to choke out, my head still turned upwards, eyes still locked on the faces forming in the clouds.\n\n\u201cNow son, I already told you this thing can\u2019t make phone calls,\u201d the man said, though not without some irony in his voice. \u201cBut to put it simply, they are the dead. The nukes that went off in this world weren\u2019t just salted; they were spiced, too. The sound waves produced by the blasts were designed to have a particular psychotronic resonance to them, causing every human consciousness that heard it to literally explode out of their skulls.\u201d\n\n\u201cExplode?\u201d I asked meekly, the tension in my own head having already grown far from comfortable.\n\n\u00a0\u201cThat\u2019s right: Kablamo!\u201d the man shouted. \u201cThe intention was just to maximize the body count, but there was an even darker side effect that the bombmakers hadn\u2019t dared to envision. Those disembodied consciousnesses didn\u2019t just go and line up at the Pearly Gates. No, sir. Caught in the psychotronic shockwave, they rode it all the way up into the stratosphere and got caught in the planet-spanning ash clouds. Their minds are perpetually stuck in the moment of their apocalyptic deaths, and since their screams are all in perfect resonance with each other, they just grow louder and louder. That wind you hear? It\u2019s not wind. It\u2019s billions of disembodied voices trapped in the stratospheric ash cloud, amplified to the point that you can hear them all the way down on the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 my head\u2019s going to explode, and my ghost is going to be stuck haunting a fallout cloud for all eternity?\u201d I demanded in disbelief, disbelief I desperately clung to, as it was the only thing keeping me from succumbing to a full existential meltdown.\n\n\u201cNot to worry, son. As long as you don\u2019t resonate with them, you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he assured me in a warm, fatherly tone. \u201cYour head won\u2019t explode, and you won\u2019t get sucked up into the ash clouds. Just listen to the dial tone. Let your mind resonate with it instead. Once you believe in the wonders of the Atomic Age, you will be free of the fear of an atomic holocaust.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026No. You\u2019re lying. The only signal is coming from the phone, not the sky,\u201d I managed to protest.\n\n\u201cSon, I can assure you that old Brinkman here doesn\u2019t lie. My psychotronic retuning makes it impossible for me to consciously acknowledge any kind of cognitive dissonance,\u201d the man tried to assuage me. \u201cSo when I tell you something, you had better believe that is the one and only truth in my heart! That\u2019s what makes me such a great salesman, CEO, and war propagandist; honesty! The screaming coming from the cloud is both real and fatal, and if you don\u2019t let the Attophone\u2019s countersignal do its thing, I\u2019m telling you your goose is cooked! I\u2019m sorry, is it just cooked now? Is that what the kids are saying? You\u2019re cooked, son; sans goose.\u201d \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou said it yourself; this isn\u2019t real. You wanted me to see the apocalypse so that I\u2019ll embrace salvation. *Your* salvation,\u201d I managed to croak. \u201cThere are no ghosts in the fallout. You just want me to be too afraid to reject you, to hang up before you finish doing whatever it is you\u2019re trying to do to me.\u201d\n\nThere was a long pause where I heard nothing but the screaming ghosts and screeching dial tone before Brinkman spoke again.\n\n\u201cIf you really believe that, then go ahead and hang up the phone,\u201d he suggested calmly.\n\nI stood there, panting heavily but saying nothing, my fingers still clutching the receiver and pressing it up against my ear. I closed my eyes and tried to ignore the nuclear hellscape around me, tried to focus on the fact that it wasn\u2019t real. The dial tone that was trying to rewrite my brain was the real threat, not the imagined ghosts in the fallout-saturated stratosphere. But the louder the dial tone grew, the less forcefully cheery it sounded. It didn\u2019t sound sincere, necessarily, but it sounded better than eternity as a fallout ghost. I began to wonder if it would be better to end up like Brinkman than risk such a horrible fate. Would it be more rational to choose the more pleasant hell, or was it worth the risk to ensure that my mind remained my own?\n\nSlowly but surely, I gradually loosened my grasp on the receiver, until I felt it slip from my hand.\n\nAs the sound of the dial tone faded, the vertigo that I had felt from before came back tenfold, and an instantly debilitating cluster headache overcame me as I cried out and collapsed to the ground. The pain was so intense that I could barely think, and for a moment, I did truly think that my head was about to explode and that my consciousness was to be condemned to a radioactive ash cloud for all eternity. Before I lost consciousness, I remembered hearing the Brinkman\u2019s voice again, wafting distant and dreamlike from the dangling receiver.\n\n*\u201cSon, you\u2019ve been a grave disappointment.\u201d*\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen I woke up, I was in the hospital. Someone had called an ambulance after they found me collapsed outside. When I told the healthcare workers and police my story, they told me there had been no phone there, and never had been. They weren\u2019t sure what was wrong with me, or if I was lying or delirious, so they kept me for observation.\n\nThe fact that there was no phone and no evidence that any of it had been real was enough to make me seriously doubt it had happened at all, and I spent several hours thinking about what else could have possibly explained what happened to me.\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s when the radiation burns started to appear.\n\nThe doctors estimate that I was exposed to at least two hundred rads of radiation. Maybe more. It\u2019s too soon to say if I received a fatal dose, but it definitely would have been if I had stayed on the phone call much longer. The doctors are flabbergasted over how I could have received so much radiation, and there are specialists sweeping the streets with Geiger counters to find an orphan source. I wish I knew where I could\u2019ve gotten one of those earlier. Then again, I suppose I didn\u2019t really need one. I was warned, after all. \u00a0\n\n*If it\u2019s Plutonium, it blisters*. Now it seems that I, and my goose, may be cooked. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"},"12":{"title":"IT's here!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kkz5jm\/its_here\/","flair":null,"author":"MK_Nyaga10","selftext":"The first time I noticed Him-It was 8 days ago in class. The day had started off pretty usual, the lazy yawn as I got up from my bed, the slight stagger and dizziness from my iron difficiency and the dread from having to go about another long and boring day. I arrived in class 30 mins early, I always preferred this as I would get to pick my usual favourite spot, a corner at the far back, discrete and private. Here I could daydream however long I wanted, occasionally I would take short naps without having to worry about the lecturer noticing me and making a whole scene about it.\n\nAnyway, it was Monday 8am, I had been in my little corner of heaven long enough to watch everyone slowly come in clud in their best outfits some of which seemed no different from basic underwear but I digress. The lecturer Miss Purity an ironic name considering her bitchy personality stood there in her 4 inch heels to her 5 foot 4 height, tight white skirt that purposely actuated her curves and overdone makeup, she smiled widely at her audience specifically the men\/boys who were practically a decade younger, I hated her to the bone but that's for another day, she took out her notes, cleared her throat and announced, \"alright class let's begin our first lesson of the day, the topic, Conflict Theory by Karl Marx.\"\n\nThe lecture went on and on for about an hour or so, pretty normal nothing out of the ordinary, my eyes had started to get drowsy and I instinctively started to clear a small space on my desk to take a power nap. My body relaxed concurring with my decision, my right cheek cushioned my face on the wooden desk and my eyes slowly started to close. I was about to let out my last yawn before clocking out when something jolted me awake.\n\n\"So pretty\", were the words that sent shivers down my spine, I shot upright and instinctively looked to my left, the voice had been rough and crude, like an old man with a bad voicebox. But what had shocked was neither the words nor the voice, it was the fact that it felt as if whoever had said them, had done it next to my ear, like a direct whisper. As I looked around my face contorted in shock I was met with confused stares from my classmates, their expressions read, \"what's with the weirdo?\" Had I imagined it, was it just in my head?  I took a deep breath and decided that I was probably sleep deprived and overthinking things, I turned my head towards my desk ready to continue with my sleep when I saw It.\n\nMy eyes had gotten a glimpse of something, something strange and out of place, was that a mirage, a trick of the light I wondered, I had to be sure, slowly I raised my head, my eyes cautiously moved from the desk, to the neighbour infront of me to Miss Purity my target. My body stiffened, my body hairs shot up, I could hear my heartbeat in my ears, my back felt wet and cold, was it sweat? My breath was labored and my eyes were wide staring at It.\n\nStanding next to her was an organism, a being,\n a creature, an entity, it stood at 6 feet, pale white, Its left arm was hidden behind her but the right hand specifically the fingers carresed Miss Purity's hair, they were long and crooked like a withered tree branch, the fingers gently stroked her hair letting the long strands gracefully dance on its tips, then it smiled, fuck the smile, it stretched from cheek to cheek, the cheekbones felt wrong, they were too high, too distinct, too close to where the eyes should be, \"oh wait\" I realised, it doesn't have eyes.\n\nThe only facial features was the smile, the barely noticeable nose and the ears, they were big like a bats, every few seconds they'd shudder as if vibrating, drops of sweat were now dripping onto my desk, what was It? And why wasn't anyone screaming, I carefully looked around, everyone was doing their own thing, talking, laughing, sleeping, the victim herself Miss Purity was her normal self, no sense of alarm, no fear, was I high! Had I gone mad? Then I heard it again, \"so pretty\", this time I saw it, the movement of it's mouth as it talked, I let out an audible shudder, then just as quickly covered my mouth with my hands, \"had It heard me?\" It had.\n\nThe creature, slowly cocked It's head upwards, Its face moved from the right corner of the room as if scanning for something, Its ears seemed to vibrate faster, as if they were excited, I could feel the dread, the terror, subconsciously I knew what it was looking for, specifically who it was looking for, me. I felt the tingle, the drop in blood pressure, the tear as we came face to face and It's smile widened, \"you see me.\" It said as I collapsed to the floor.\n\nI woke up with a startle, I was breathing heavy, my vision was blurry as I looked around frantically, where was I, was I safe, was I dead and more importantly where was It? I felt a touch on my shoulder that almost sent me on a direct ticket to heaven, it was the university doctor, I had collapsed in class, my classmates had carried me here, that was 9 hours ago. The doctor informed me that my blood pressure was slightly allevated(no kidding) but other than that I was okay, she recommended rest and a proper meal, I nodded in agreement and left not wanting to bring up whatever it is that I saw or I'd end up in the counseling office.\n\nThe sun had began to set, on my way home my mind was locked in a battle of sanity, was what I had seen real, was it the result of an overactive imagination, now calm my psychology mind took over trying to make sense of the ordeal, I concluded that no I was not insane, I was probably fatigued, whatever I thought I saw was too unrealistic to be real. The next few days proved me right, no incidents occured, the nights were uneventful and the days normal, everything was back to normal, or so I thought.\n\n*Present, it's Monday 9pm, the date 12 May 2025. The date is important, the time is important, I want you to know, I need you to know! I live in Nairobi Town, Kenya I don't have time for specifics, I am Male 26years old. This information is important keep it. He's here, It's here, I can feel Its presence right outside my bedroom door, I have baracaded myself and I'm pacing up and down my room. All lights are off safe for my phone, I have called the police I doubt they'll make it in time, this is my last will, my story, don't forget me!\n\nI had gotten home at around 7pm excited to watch a Korean show I was bingeing, everything had been okay till the familiar chill hit me, the lights flickered a bit before going off, I was scared but calmed my nerves, slowly I had risen from my sofa and felt my way to the cupboard where my torch was, I turned it on and scanned my surroundings, everything was normal, I tried the light switch it didn't work, I took a deep breath and convinced my body to stop shaking I was just shook nothing more, everything is alrig... the torch slipped to the floor.\n\nI heard it, It had found me, \"hello there,\" the menacing words froze me to the bone, it sounded close, real close, like an arm stretch away, the torch illuminated the room halfway enough form me to see that there was nothing there, where was It? Knees buckling I crouched and slowly picked up the torch, hands shaking I directed the light from one corner of the room to the other, the light danced from the sofa, to where the tv was, to the water dispenser, to the doorway leading into the kitche... the door was open, It was standing there.\n\nWhat happened next had been purely out of primal instinct, I ran up the stairs into my bedroom, I shut the door and dragged my wardrobe so that it lay against the door, I was safe for a moment, reaching into my pocket I pulled out my phone and dialed the emergency number 112, I was frantic, short of breath, I explained, they thought I was pulling a prank, I cried, they empathized and promised to send someone. As I stood there my body weak, my clothes drenced in sweat I kept wondering to myself why me? \n\nI could hear Its footsteps as it climbed the stairs one by one, as if taunting me, like it knew I couldn't escape, I was helpless, useless, a sitting duck. Realising the hopelessness of my situation I opened Reddit, a trace had to be left, someone had to know. \n\nIts standing right outside my door, I can feel Its breath, it's heavy and fast paced, like a wild animal preparing for a meal, the door knob creaks, the wardrobe shudders, It's trying to get in, I take a step back, one after the other, my eyes are fixed, fixed on the door, my ears attentive, it stops, all movement stops. Why did it stop? Did the creature leave? What's going on? My back comes into contact with something, the bedroom wall? No, it's warm, it's soft, it's skin! I freeze, my legs give way, my eyes go blank, \"there you are!!\", I hit POST."},"13":{"title":"The Feeding of The Mountain Man (Part 1)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kkh8ou\/the_feeding_of_the_mountain_man_part_1\/","flair":"Series","author":"ConsciousAd6511","selftext":"There is a phenomenon known as the uncanny valley. This is, of course, when you see something that looks almost human, but you can tell it isn't and it makes you scared. Something on a primal level in you is saying that it's bad news and you need to get out. Everyone knows this, but no one thinks about it. This means at some point in our evolution it was needed for us to be scared of things that looked human, but weren't. I know why.\n\nTo clarify these events happened years ago. There are 3 encounters with the first being unsettling, the second was horrifying, and the third is why I moved out of the Catskills and into the city. I might only share the first one since I don't want to destroy my credibility or relive it. Granted I am anonymous since I haven't shared this with anyone. After the third time I got in my car and crashed it right after so that I had a plausible excuse, but no one really believes me much about that. Anyway I'll just start.\n\nThis happened when I was 15. I grew up in the woods so camping is something I did normally. I was also in boy scouts at this time before I dropped out at 17. I remember I used to brag to all the other kids that I could set up my tent faster than them, but no one gave the slighted shit. I recall one time I was messing around with my friend James and we saw a deer maybe 50 feet down the campsite. We were just unloading so I was carrying over our axes. He dared me 10 bucks if I would try to get the deer with the axe. Before the words fully left his mouth I set off at full speed, running and screaming. Naturally I was nowhere close and the deer could have easily just turned around and rammed right into me. I never did get my 10 bucks by the way. Another time me and some friends were on top of a mountain, so naturally in my infinite wisdom I decided to see how close I could run to the edge of the peak without falling. It appeared too close since I stumbled and fell onto the next flat section that sort of poked out down at a 90 degree angle. Luckily my springy body wasn't really hurt, but I hope that paints a picture of me at that time. It's kind of funny how the stupid stunts I pulled like that weren't the notable ones, but one way more mild.\n\nMe and my aunt, who lived even further north of me, decided for some bonding we'd go camping together during the summer. Despite popular belief it actually can get rather hot in New York in the summer, and especially for me who's a hot body I'd get uncomfortable. As a result of this along with my tent being very short, on a very hot night I may be found sticking my legs out of my tent in my sleeping bag when I was too hot. My aunt and Idecided to go to this spot that was kind of a campground, but the sites were very very far apart. In addition to this there was only one rest room that was a few hundred yards away, maybe 10-20. To pass the time that day we went hiking around one nearby path. It was nice since it was clear, no wind, no planes, just pure nature. We were probably out for 2 hours before my aunt had to relieve herself so we went back to camp so she could get to the rest rooms. She passed right through our campsite while I stayed back to wait for her return. I was just kicking rocks for a while before I decided I was hungry so I went to get food. Our snacks were in a bag in my aunt's tent, so I went in and found it mostly empty besides a few cans of beans. I figured it had just been a rat or something that had pulled them off somewhere. I couldn't remember if the tent was zipped or not when I went in. If a rat got in it must have been open, but I could have sworn I unzipped the flaps. Unless there was a hole in her tent. I checked around all the sides but couldn't find one. Yeah, the zipper must have been undone, that's the only logical way.\n\nI told her about it when she returned and she looked puzzled but agreed with me before inspecting the tent and the surrounding area. I remember she looked at one spot on the ground and stared at it for a solid minute before saying, \"So weird.\" I asked what she meant, but she quickly shot her head up like she forgot I was there and said it was nothing before sweeping her foot across the ground where she had been looking. I didn't care at the time because I was busy being so proud that I figured out it was a rat, but looking back I assume she erased something that was in the dirt. After that we made a fire and by we I mean I tried for a solid 10-20 minutes with a flint and steel before she just used a lighter to get it going. At probably 9:30ish we called it a night and put out the fire.\n\nLike I said, it was hot out and my clothes still trapped heat from the fire so I decided I would let my legs rest in the cool air that night. Now, hindsight is 20\/20 and you may think only an idiot would do that, but I'd like to reiterate I was very very comfortable in the woods and this is something I had done before with no issues. Still, it definitely wasn't bright. I was tired from the day so fell into slumber fairly quickly. I don't recall dreaming that night, I usually did but I felt like there was some block for that night.\n\nI woke up. I tried to think of what woke me but nothing did. I figured some sound had tipped me off, probably just the wind. No, it couldn't have been, there had been no wind all day. Was there an animal? I listened closely for the sound of something, anything. Not one cricket, not one frog, nothing. That was until I heard the sound of stepping on leaves. I listened for a second and based on the pace I could tell it had two feet. Oh of course, it was my aunt. She probably just went into the brush to piss and... wait no. She can't do that, she's not a guy. The bath house is in the other direction too. I felt a pit in my stomach. I was deeply fearful at that moment. I tried to calm myself down. \"Maybe she was just desperate\" \"Maybe she was doing something else\", but what I really needed was to hear the sound of the footsteps walk over to her tent, get in, and zip it up. I listened to the footsteps grow closer and realized whoever it was is heavy. They came closer to our tent and I thought I heard them turn towards my aunt's tent, but no. Suddenly whoever it was turned towards mine. I was scared, until I remembered my legs and feet were exposed, then I was terrified. I heard their powerful steps walk up to the side of my tent. They stopped for just a second and I looked up at the tent wall. Their hands were pressing down on the tent making imprints. I could have pissed myself right there. Slowly I pulled my feet into my tent. I felt an all consuming need for this person not to know I knew of them. Their hands pressed deeper as I pulled my feet in closer until I was fully back in my tent.\n\nMoments later their hands were taken off the tent. I felt relieved, like the weight of the world was off my shoulders for about three seconds before I realized just because they weren't doing anything didn't mean they weren't still there. I heard no footsteps leave my tent. The next thing I heard was them stepping to the front of my tent. I closed my eyes and shut them tight. I didn't want to see them. If I saw them that means they're real and God knows I don't want that. I heard their feet shift. I figured that meant they were squatting down. They could now see me. They were watching me. In my own tent they were watching me. My senses were heightened so I could hear every move they made. I heard their arm push against the air as they slowly moved it into my tent. A feeling shot through me. I felt them. They were grabbing my foot. I didn't make sound but I felt tears well up in my eyes. I wanted to scream and run, but couldn't. I wished that the Earth would just swallow me. Suddenly I felt them let go and began to stand up and walk away. Back into the woods where they came. It didn't feel real. If you ever passed out it feels like the time when you just have lost control and. you perceive everything around you. but it feels much more dreamy than reality. I began to question if it was even real. It could have just been a nightmare. Actually it might have been sleep paralysis, I've heard about that. I tried to convince myself it didn't actually happen.\n\nI zipped up my tent after what felt like an eternity. I curled into a ball and stared into nothingness. After what must have been hours I saw light begin to peak through my tent. I heard my aunt's tent unzip and I rushed out of my tent. She looked at me with a smile and said jokingly, \"You must have had a lot to drink huh. You should tone it down or you'll turn into a fish.\" I responded extremely confused and still shaken, \"What do you mean?\" She stated back, \"Well I heard you walking around during the night, I figured you went to relieve yourself. I must have heard footsteps go back and forth from your tent three times during the night.\" I looked at her and my expression must have spoken volumes. Her face dimmed, \"You didn't get up? Well I'm sure it was just a raccoon or something. You know what, it probably wasn't even anything. How about this, you go wait in the car and I'll pack everything up.\" I agreed to this and sat in the passenger seat blankly staring. I could see her thinking hardly and pacing a bit periodically between taking down supplies. She would keep going back to a point and staring down. Eventually she finished and went back to that spot a final time and began to brush the dirt in multiple spots going away from where my tent used to be. I sat up and looked at whatever the last one of whatever she was getting rid of before they reached the tree line. It was a footprint."},"14":{"title":"I made a compass that points to the Fountain of Youth.

I don\u2019t care. I need to get this out of my head, and to warn you all. \n\n\nA few months ago, I found an archived forum through a Tor mirror. Mostly dead links, old files, weird diagrams. It read like a cross between a survivalist message board and a metaphysics cult. One thread was titled \u201cSOURCE LOCATION \/ YOUTH ZONE \/ MN-X GRID,\u201d posted by someone with a username that was just a string of numbers and slashes.\n\n\nIt was about the Fountain of Youth. An actual place. The instructions were a mess: broken English, bad formatting, but one phrase came up over and over:\n\n\u201cIt doesn't matter where you start. Walk due True North. Do not drift. If the needle drifts, you\u2019ve already passed it.\u201d\n\n\nPeople in the thread argued about it. Some said \u201cTrue North\u201d meant geographic, others said it was an induced flux in the Earth's magnetic field, still others argued a \"cosmic north.\" \n\n\nOne guy said you needed a special kind of compass that could \u201cattune\u201d to local fields. Someone else posted a DIY schematic. No explanation, just a blurry photo of what looked like a needle floating in oil with some kind of stone casing around it. Hematite, maybe.\n\n\nIt was probably bullshit. But it hit something in me. I was in a weird place. Burned out, disconnected, jaded. The idea that there was a place, a zone you could walk into, and just be... undone. I couldn\u2019t let it go.\n\n\nI built the compass myself. I followed the diagram with materials I barely understood. A quartz vial, thickened saline, glycerin maybe? Hematite ring as the outer shell. The needle floated, suspended, and every time I set it down, it didn\u2019t just drift\u2014it snapped into place. Like it knew where to point independent of where it was.\n\n\nI planned a solo trip into the northern Rockies. I packed light: mostly MREs and some small nonperishables. I brought a tent, backup compass (which I swore I wouldn\u2019t use), a journal, a flare gun, and a map just in case. My only rule: follow that compass. Exactly. No rerouting. No detours. Just walk where it pointed.\n\n\nThe first week was peaceful. Cold, but manageable. Nights were long, and I could see every star. I slept in a bivy sack, kept my boots outside to avoid frost, and cooked with a tiny alcohol stove. Every morning, the compass needle would be waiting, pointing that same fixed direction like it never moved. It felt... obedient. Almost helpful.\n\n\nI walked maybe ten to twelve miles a day. Sometimes I napped in the shade, stretched my legs. I made camp when the sky shifted violet. There were no markers. No signs of other hikers. It felt like I was being led, like something was unfolding just for me.\n\n\nAround Day 11, I passed a rock shelf split down the middle: clean, vertical, like a knife wound. I remember stopping there, eating a chicken and rice MRE, writing in my log, staring out over a dry gulch. It felt important, so I marked it on my paper map.\nFour days later, I passed it again. Same rock. Same split. But this time, I was approaching from the opposite side.\n\n\nI checked the compass. Still pointing \u201cnorth.\u201d Still steady. But the angle felt... wrong. Not broken. Not reversed. Just slightly off, like a half of a degree to the west.\nI told myself I must have looped accidentally. Terrain does that. Hills pull you off course. But something in me knew.\n\n\nI kept going.\n\n\nBy Day 17, I passed a stacked pile of stones I swore I built myself. Same pattern. Same flat top where I\u2019d laid a ration to cool. But I didn\u2019t remember coming back this way. And the compass hadn\u2019t changed. Still forward. Still locked-in.\n\n\nThat night, I made camp under a gnarled pine. I woke up once to pee and saw the compass needle twitch. Just once, like it was adjusting itself mid-dream.\n\n\nDay 19, I found an old fire pit with a burned can in the ashes. Same brand I\u2019d eaten days before. I looked down and realized my bootprints were already in the soil.\nThat was the moment I remembered the post:\nIf the needle drifts, you\u2019ve already passed it.\n\n\nI don\u2019t remember making the decision, but I started walking faster. Not toward anything, just away. My food was running low. My hands were shaking. I hadn\u2019t seen wildlife in days. Just the needle, pointing with more confidence than I had.\n\n\nBy the time I reached a frozen stream I\u2019d definitely crossed before, the compass had turned completely. Still locked-on, but now pointing directly behind me.\n\n\nThat was the worst part. Not that it was broken. But that I never noticed it change.\n\n\nI camped again, in the same spot where I\u2019d found my own note in a plastic bag under a high-branched cedar. I don\u2019t remember leaving it.\n\n\nThat night, I left the compass on a rock next to my bag. I swear I didn\u2019t sleep, but when I looked again, the needle was pointing at my chest. I stood up in a start, and the needle quivered in response. \n\n\nI made it out. Somehow. I followed the stars. The sun. Anything but the compass. I don\u2019t remember hiking back. Just blinking, and being on the edge of a ranger station with cracked lips and dirt in my teeth. I got home three days later.\n\n\nThe compass is still in my apartment.\nI keep it on my desk. I\u2019ve tried putting it in drawers, closets, boxes. It doesn\u2019t matter. When I take it out, it points at me. Every time.\nI\u2019ve spun it. Walked around the room. Held it upside down. The needle always finds me. Sometimes it moves before I do.\n\n\nAt first, I thought it was a trick of the gel, or magnetism. But I haven\u2019t been sleeping well. And when I do, I wake up feeling different.\nNot sick. Just... off. \n\n\nMy handwriting\u2019s cleaner. My joints don\u2019t pop. I think my eyesight\u2019s better.\n\n\nBut I forgot my sister\u2019s birthday. I always remembered her birthday.\n\n\nYesterday I had a memory of my third-grade teacher, clear as day. I haven\u2019t thought about her in decades. But I couldn\u2019t remember my last job interview. Or my apartment number.\n\n\nI used to crave simplicity. I used to want the freedom of childhood\u2014the lack of stress, the quiet inside my own head.\nBut that quiet is creeping in now.\nAnd it doesn\u2019t feel like peace.\nIt feels like forgetting.\nI don\u2019t think I found the Fountain.\nI think I passed it.\nAnd I think something followed me back.\n\n\nThe compass isn\u2019t drifting anymore.\nI am.\nAnd I don\u2019t know how far I\u2019m going.\nOr who I\u2019ll be when I get there."},"15":{"title":"[Part 3] I'm a custodian at Denver International Airport.

We picked some good hikes, made some reservations at a hotel adjacent to a hot springs we had enjoyed years ago, and I requested time off from work which was surprisingly granted. Everything seemed to be going up and up.\n\nUntil the second night in our hotel.\n\nWe had just done the first big hike of the trip, a segment of the continental divide trail, and had a hearty dinner in town before turning in for the night. My parents shared a large room, and my sister and I each had our own smaller single rooms. It was motel style, but it didn't feel rundown at all. I had been in bed for almost an hour already, but was only just at the edge of sleep having horrible chronic insomnia. I was just finally starting to feel myself drift off when I heard a rustling at my door. I froze, unsure what I should do.\n\nI was just considering getting up when the rustling stopped, only to be replaced by the slow creaking of the door as it was opened very slowly. I should have leapt up, but it felt like there was an elephant on my chest, and something in my mind screamed at me to stay still, so I didn't move and kept my eyes clamped shut. I heard someone walk quietly over the carpet towards my bed.\n\nThere was the sound of heavy breathing above me, and I could feel the wet stickiness of the person's breath hit my face. I tried to breath naturally, but had to choke down a cough from the odd smell coming from them. I don't know how long I laid there tensely trying to keep up the charade.\n\nFinally, the person spoke with my father's voice. \"I know you know. I don't care. There's nothing you can do, your father's gone. It's only me now. If you are good, maybe I'll save you for last, maybe I'll get your sister first.\"\n\nHis breath as he spoke smelled even more strongly of the strange scent that I suddenly recognized as the smell of rot. I remained frozen, fighting my urge to retch or grab him and demand he leave my sister alone.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity, I heard his footsteps moving back towards the door. \"Yeah. I think I'll start with her. Sweet dreams.\"\n\nI heard the door close. I waited a few minutes, desperately willing my body to respond. Finally I was able to muster the courage to sit up, though it felt like my muscles were still fighting against me. For a few minutes I just rocked in place, unsure what I should do. Should I try to tell my sister and mother? Should I just not let my sister be alone with him? I couldn't do that forever, what about when she finally went back to work in San Francisco? Could this thing masquerading as my father get her there?\n\nThe next day we started with another hike, this time to a nearby peak. It was a hard push, with a little scrambling and a great deal of wind at the peak, but we made it. Throughout the hike I tried to make sure I was never out of sight of my sister, and as much as possible I stayed right next to her. I watched the thing that had replaced my dad, but throughout the whole hike he didn't behave suspiciously other than looking confused at me when I'd refuse to leave my sister even to take pictures at the high point. I had to give it to him, he was playing the role perfectly.\n\nAfter the hike, we all opted to hit the hot springs adjacent to our hotel. My mom and sister decided to head to the thermal caves, leaving the thing that replaced my dad and I stuck in the pool since the caves were gender segregated. While not happy to be stuck alone with the replacement, I was deeply relieved that my sister would be safe.\n\n\"Well son - where do you wanna go? Want to hit the thermal caves?\"\n\nI thought for a moment, thinking maybe that would be nice, even with this replacement, before realizing that would make it more likely we'd find ourselves in an isolated place, something I wanted to avoid at all costs.\n\n\"Nah dad, how about we go to the hot springs swimming pool? I'd like a little more room to play in the water, and it's a bit more comfortable.\"\n\nHe laughed, \"Whatever you say son, I just want to get my muscles nice and soft after that hike.\"\n\nDespite the company, the pool was nice. I got to soak and managed to mostly avoid talking to that thing while I let my muscles relax from the hike. After a while I got out of the pool and rested in one of the chairs to avoid overheating and to think. I wasn't sure what I'd do that night, because then my sister would finally be alone in her room and I wasn't sure that I could finnagle a way to be there with her the whole night.\n\nMy brainstorming was interrupted by a cry from the thing that had replaced my dad. He had moved into the deep end of the pool, and it seemed like his muscles had cramped badly, and he was struggling to swim. He was trying to scream for me to help him, but his face was so far under water that he couldn't manage. I ran to the side of the pool he was trying to get to, and readied myself to jump in.\n\nThen it hit me. This was the solution to my problem. This thing had replaced and probably killed my dad - he had already said my dad was gone - and threatened my sister. If he died, all my worries would be over. I gulped hard, still not sure what to do, but I just sat, watching. I saw the thing wearing my dad's face look terrified, and a sense of shame washed over me. I wanted to help, so badly, my soul screamed for me to just jump in, but I knew the only chance my sister would have is if I didn't.\n\nIt took a few minutes, but, eventually I saw him stop moving beneath the water. I stared in shock, unable to think straight. Finally I realized I needed to call someone. I ran to the emergency phone at the pool entrance and called the lobby.\n\nThe rest of the day went by in a haze. There was an ambulance, a declaration that the thing that replaced my dad was not dead, but in a coma, lots of crying by all of us - them for the thing in a coma, me for my dad who I knew was already dead. After the hospital we decided to stay back at the hotels for now, to remain close to the hospital. The doctors said that they would decide what to do in the next few days - either he'd wake up, or they'd relocate him to Denver.\n\nFalling asleep that night, I felt grief for my father, but relief that the thing stealing his body was in a coma and that my sister would be safe. I managed to fall asleep in only a half hour, the easiest sleep I'd had in years.\n\nI woke up startled by the door opening again. I kept my eyes shut again, not sure what was happening, but knowing it would be safer if I just played asleep. I heard and felt someone breathing over me again. The smell was that same smell of rot that had come from the thing that replaced my father, but with a faint tinge of a sweet orange scent.\n\nWhen they finally spoke, they uttered only a single phrase, a phrase that haunts me to this day.\n\n\"Too late,\" the thing that replaced my sister said.\n\n\\--\n\nAlright, I should probably leave things there for now. I promise I'll post again and finish catching you all up, but I need to spend some time today planning my next move. In the meantime, let me suggest that you don't leave your loved ones alone after traveling through the Denver airport - or you may wake up to them not being your loved ones any longer."},"16":{"title":"My little brother came back last night.

He was eight. It was nighttime, and he\u2019d snuck away with some other boys to see the lake under the stars. They said he slipped on the dock. By the time they found him, it was too late.\n\nI was thirteen. I didn\u2019t go on that trip \u2014 I was home, playing video games. I remember getting the phone call, hearing my mom\u2019s scream, my dad\u2019s voice cracking for the first time. We buried Ethan with his favorite photo \u2014 the one of him and me standing by the lake, grinning like idiots.\n\nWe haven\u2019t spoken about him since.\n\nHis room stayed locked. Sometimes I thought I heard things from inside \u2014 soft thuds, creaks, whispers \u2014 but I chalked it up to grief and silence. My parents stopped smiling. My mom started taking sleeping pills. My dad just stopped talking altogether.\n\nLast night, at 3:12 AM, I heard tapping on my bedroom window.\n\nWe live on the second floor.\n\nAt first, I thought it was the wind. But the tapping didn\u2019t stop. It was rhythmic. Slow. Careful. I turned over, annoyed\u2026 then froze.\n\nOutside the window, in the moonlight, stood Ethan.\n\nHis face was pale. His lips were blue. His hair dripped water down his cheeks. He wore the same Spiderman pajamas he used to sleep in \u2014 soaked through and clinging to his tiny body. He didn\u2019t look older. He looked exactly the same as the day we buried him.\n\nHe didn\u2019t speak. He didn\u2019t smile. He just stared and tapped on the glass with one finger, over and over.\n\nI screamed.\n\nMy parents ran in and flipped the lights. Ethan was gone. The window was closed, locked from the inside. They told me it was a nightmare.\n\nBut I know what I saw.\n\nThis morning, the carpet near my window was wet. There were small footprints \u2014 the kind Ethan used to leave when he ran barefoot after swimming. My window lock was undone.\n\nAnd on the floor was the photo we buried with him.\n\nIt was torn down the middle, soaked, and smelled like lake water.\n\nI tried to show my parents, but the footprints dried and the photo vanished. I thought I was losing my mind \u2014 until just now.\n\nIt\u2019s 3:12 again.\n\nThe tapping is back.\n\nBut this time\u2026 the window is already open.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I don\u2019t want to believe it, but it\u2019s impossible to ignore. My heart races in my chest as I sit up in bed, my hands trembling. The tapping continues, slow and deliberate, just like before. It\u2019s maddening, the way it echoes in the dead of night.\n\nI get up, my feet moving instinctively toward the window, though every part of me is screaming to stay away. I reach for the handle and hesitate. I don\u2019t want to open it. I don\u2019t want to see him again, but I know I have no choice.\n\nWith a shaky breath, I pull the window open.\n\nThe cold air rushes in, and for a moment, I wonder if this is real. Maybe I\u2019m still dreaming. Maybe I\u2019m just imagining all of this.\n\nBut then I hear it\u2014the sound of tiny, wet footsteps on the ground below. Soft, like the padding of bare feet against the grass. I lean out the window, trying to make sense of what\u2019s happening, my heart pounding in my ears.\n\nThere he is.\n\nEthan.\n\nHe\u2019s standing on the lawn, his little face still pale, his clothes soaked through. His Spiderman pajamas cling to his small frame, the fabric heavy with water. His hair hangs in wet strands around his face, and his eyes are wide, unblinking, staring up at me.\n\nThe tapping continues, his finger hitting the window with that same slow rhythm.\n\nI swallow hard, my throat tight. \u201cEthan\u2026\u201d The word comes out as a whisper, choked with emotion. I don\u2019t know what to say. How could I ever explain this? How could I tell anyone that my little brother is standing in front of me after being gone for three years?\n\nHe doesn\u2019t move. He doesn\u2019t speak. He just keeps staring at me, tapping. Each tap seems to echo louder, like it\u2019s pounding into my skull.\n\nI take a step back, suddenly overwhelmed with fear and sadness. \u201cPlease\u2026\u201d My voice cracks. \u201cPlease, Ethan, don\u2019t do this. Come inside. You\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re scaring me.\u201d\n\nFor a moment, I think he might leave. His head tilts slightly, like he\u2019s considering my words. But then, he reaches up with both hands and places them against the glass.\n\nI gasp, feeling the cold from his touch seeping through the window, even though it\u2019s closed. He presses harder, as if trying to reach me, as if he\u2019s begging me to understand something I can\u2019t.\n\nThe silence stretches on, and the air feels thick with something I can\u2019t describe\u2014something dark and suffocating.\n\nThen, without warning, the image of Ethan starts to blur. His form flickers, like a malfunctioning TV screen. For a split second, I see something else. Something\u2026 darker. A shadow stretching out from him, swirling around his feet, crawling up his legs.\n\nAnd then, just as suddenly as it started, the tapping stops.\n\nI blink, and in that moment, Ethan is gone.\n\nMy heart stops. I rush to the window, pushing it open further, but there\u2019s nothing. No wet footprints. No signs of him at all.\n\nOnly the cold, empty night.\n\nI pull the window shut and turn to face my room, my hands shaking uncontrollably. What is happening to me? What\u2019s going on with Ethan? And why won\u2019t my parents believe me?\n\nI glance at my clock. It\u2019s 3:12 again.\n\nThis time, the room feels different. Like the air is heavier. My eyes wander to the corner of my room, where the dresser is. That\u2019s when I notice it.\n\nThe photo. The one we buried with him. It\u2019s lying on the floor in front of me.\n\nIt\u2019s soaked.\n\nAnd this time, the photo is different. It\u2019s not the same one. It\u2019s a new one, a picture of me and Ethan, standing by the lake, smiling. But this time, I\u2019m holding his hand. And he\u2019s staring directly at the camera, his eyes wide with a strange, unsettling intensity.\n\nI\u2019m not imagining this. I know I\u2019m not.\n\nI try to move, but I feel a sharp cold on the back of my neck, like fingers brushing against my skin.\n\nI turn around.\n\nThere\u2019s a handprint on my bedroom door.\n\nIt\u2019s wet.\n\nAnd it\u2019s small.\n"},"17":{"title":"I'm trapped on the edge of an abyss.

The complex sat imposingly right on the edge of the shelf, like a creature peaking its head over the side of the abyss, staring at Hope and I as we drew near. It looked hungry. Excited that its prey was willingly coming straight for it.\n\nWe stopped about 30 feet from the front door, staring inside. The slightly tinted windows only half helped to mask the interior; bright neon colors and black lights casting it all in a blue glow. It was such a harsh change in lighting compared to what we\u2019d been living in for the past month that it almost hurt my eyes to look at.\n\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Hope swallowed, \u201cYou ready?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I told her, my heart thudding softly to the drumbeat of the party music playing inside.\n\nThe doors welcomed us in with an automatic whir, all too eager to get us inside. My skin crawled as we stepped into the entrance hall and already had a face glaring at us. A plastic statue of a Zebra smiling wide was sat affixed to a bench, one hooved arm stretched along the back for kids to sit themselves inside. As a young girl, I always thought the charming little photo op was awesome, getting to sit next to a famous local character. Now that I was an adult, I found the striped horse\u2019s unmoving, cartoon pupils unsettling.\n\n\u201cHey, Zane,\u201d Hope softly joked as we moved past.\n\nWe were cautious as we passed through the next set of doors and entered the party space, taking it all in. The room was huge, almost looking bigger now that we were inside, although, whether that was due to some sort of anomaly or just clever space use, I wasn\u2019t sure. The space was one continuous stretch, but several half walls or large decorations sectioned off the designated areas. It was all just as I remembered.\n\nPillars holding up the ceiling were disguised to look like trees, while fake foliage was strewn across the ceiling to give the space the illusion of a forest canopy. Bright, colorful spotlights punctured through it to blanket the neon confetti carpet below, energizing all the bright colors with a ghastly glow. Sinister statues of grinning jungle creatures and cartoony murals on the walls all sat frozen in time, unable to move and escape this rotting nightmare.\n\nThe arcade machines and games were all still present, cramming the space and stuffed up on even more balconies, but even though their decorative lights were still functioning, their screens were off and dark, creating a funhouse of black mirrors that stared imposingly at Hope and I.\n\nI gingerly unhooked the velvet rope that barred us from entering, then the two of us moved through without getting a stamp on our hands.\n\nWe only moved a few steps into the room before stopping once more, not yet ready to dive into the maze of machines and tacky d\u00e9cor.\n\n\u201cWhere should we start looking first?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Hope whispered back, her voice barely cutting through the generic 60s rock that echoed through the building. Her head turned on a pivot before locking on the area off to our left; the prize counter. Wordlessly she began moving closer, \u201cHang on, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, you finally trying to get that big stuffed horse that we always wanted?\u201d I teased her.\n\n\u201cNo, smart Alec.\u201d She jabbed back, reaching the massive cave of toys and candy before hopping the counter.\n\n\u201cWhoa, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re allowed to be back there.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoy, aren\u2019t you just on fire with the comedy today?\u201d Hope snipped sarcastically, browsing the prizes before she excitedly perked up and moved across the space. She stopped at a case and slid it open, pulling out a stick like object. \u201cC\u2019mon, let this work\u2026\u201d\n\nI tilted my head in confusion, then moved toward her before my vision was blinded by a bright flash. I blinked a couple times and shielded my eyes before hope finally turned the flashlight on herself, showing off a wild grin of pride.\n\n\u201cWe finally have working lights that are brighter than 2 feet!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, hell yeah,\u201d I said, moving to her and taking the light across the counter, \u201cFill your pack with the rest of them in case the batteries run out.\u201d The two of us had tried finding a flashlight in town already, but every triple or double A battery on the shelf has been decomposed into a chalky, corroded mess.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird this place isn\u2019t rotten like the outside. I wonder why that is.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Although, I\u2019m sure if anything spends enough time in a place like this, it\u2019s bound to get screwed up eventually\u2014\u201d\n\nA loud, abrupt noise across the room made hope and I jump, to which she ducked behind the counter and I instinctively dove for a nearby divider. My body cursed me out with pain as I slammed against the barely padded carpet, and I quickly felt dumb for even doing it in the first place once the noise registered in my head.\n\nPeeking out from our hiding places, Hope and I looked across the room toward the open dining area. A stage built into the wall had its curtain drawn back and upon it, five animatronic animals jerked and pivoted at their post, pretending to strum guitars or pound drums and keyboards. The two of us looked to one another with an almost sheepish expression, then stepping out, starting toward them.\n\nA heavy wave of nostalgia hit me as we drew near. Along the rim of the stage, there were several booths fanning out like sunbeams, and I vividly recall sitting in one of them as a child. My hands gripping the side of the stage and looking up in admiration at the magical characters jamming out. Even as a kid, I knew that they were simply the sorcery of automation, but still, I think I found the concept of a lifelike looking robot so cool and fascinating.\n\nI don\u2019t know what child me was thinking.\n\nZane and his crew were positively horrific. Their movements were jerky and abrupt, and even over the blaring tunes, I could hear their mechanical parts clicking and whirring as they were puppeted about. Most of the other band members had fallen to the back of my mind over the years; a tiger on the base, an elephant on a massive drum kit in the back, an orangutan playing a keyboard with his feet. Zane had remained, however.\n\nHe was almost bigger than I remembered him, most likely a side effect of size being a much more instinctual intimidating factor to an adult than a kid. He stood a little over 7 feet tall. The skeleton that I could see through the gaps of his faux fur pumped with powerful pistons and gears to keep him swiveling and dancing like a rock star, a stark contrast to his friendly outside appearance. His thick neck and elongated face stretched and warped the latex mask over top of it as the zebra sang about friendship and dancing, giving me an uncanny lump in my throat as I stared too long. The lifeless, perfectly round eyes sunken into their sockets that seemed to follow me didn\u2019t help.\n\nThe main attraction of Zane, however, and the reason I most likely remembered him so well, was what featured on his torso. He, of course, had stripes like any other zebra, but it was only along his sides, back, mane, and face. His belly was a plain, white canvas. Behind it, the animatronic had been fitted with a small projector inside, and when music began to play, Zane had living stripes that would dance to life across his belly, usually fitting the theme of whatever song he was singing. Looking back on it now, it was honestly really impressive for the time considering how much they fit into a small space, and for how well the effect worked.\n\nOnce again, though, through my matured eyes, seeing the ominous glow radiating from Zane\u2019s guts was a little unsettling\u2026\n\nAs hope and I stared, the last song of the set began to kick up, and the nostalgia really hit. I remembered this one. Not all of it, but specifically the last part of the chorus. It was so ear-wormy and catchy that even all these years later I still knew the lyrics. When it finally began ringing out, I couldn\u2019t stop my brain from at least humming along to the tune.\n\n*\u201cAnd if we stick to-geth-er!*\n\n*Then this dance can last for-ev-er!*\n\n*C\u2019mon and dance the night a-way with me!\u201d*\n\nThat one probably stuck in my memory cause it was always the last song of the night. When it played, that meant that it was soon time to go home. We didn\u2019t have the luxury of going to a place like this often when I was young\u2014we really couldn\u2019t afford it\u2014but we went enough times for me to feel a sadness in my heart when I left that day on my birthday. There was an extra layer of melancholy that came with it now, as well, knowing that it was the last time I\u2019d ever hear it.\n\nWell, until now, of course.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but snicker to myself, reflecting in my time away from my old zebra pal, \u201cTrust me, Zane. I tried dancing plenty of nights away. It never helped.\u201d\n\nThe instruments drew to a close, and Hope nudged my arm, \u201cWe should start moving. We\u2019ve already killed a lot of time.\u201d\n\nShe was right. We\u2019d gotten so swept up in all the nostalgia that we completely forgot the mission at hand. Any faint sense of comfort I\u2019d gotten from fond memories quickly faded, and I remembered that we weren\u2019t at the old Jammin\u2019 Jungle\u2019 in Cali right now. We were in a shoddy recreation perched on the edge of an abyss.\n\nHope and I moved for a set of employee doors that led to the kitchen. We could already see most of the main space and play structures; if there was anything important or Kingfisher related out here, we would have seen it by now.\n\nWhat the doors swung open to was immediately what broke the immersion of the otherwise flawless place.\n\nIt was weird; the space was just like outside. A perfect recreation of what Zane\u2019s kitchen must have looked like. The problem was, it was only half of one. Well, even half might be giving too much.\n\nImagine, from outside of a doorway, you shined a spotlight into a room. It would make a giant cone of light into the space, the edges of which would be cut off by the doorframe. It was like everything from that perspective existed. There were a couple stove tops, some counters next to them, then nothing on either side of those. Literally nothing. There was a divider wall in the middle of the room with a window to pass food through, some pizza ovens, then a sink that was sliced clean in half by a diagonal line. Even the floor was a perfect expanding beam of tiles that ran across the floor toward the back wall, where the wallpaper then did the same.\n\nAnything that wasn\u2019t in the strange beam from the doorway was just a plain, dark, concrete room.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I muttered, \u201cWhy\u2026 why is it like this?\u201d\n\nHope backed up to the door with a furrowed brow, then stared for a moment. \u201cWe just\u2026 don\u2019t remember it.\u201d\n\nI turned to her.\n\n\u201cWe never went back here as kids, so it doesn\u2019t know how to finish it. We only ever saw through the door.\u201d\n\nI looked down at my feet then stepped slowly to the edge of the kitchen tile, cautiously dipping a toe over the cutoff line. When I saw that it was fine, I muttered, \u201cWeird\u2026\u201d\n\nOther than the odd spatial anomaly, there was nothing really to note inside the kitchen other than a dark doorway in the wall. It was on one of the unfinished walls of the room, and shining one of our new flashlights into it only revealed a space too vast for the beam to illuminate anything. We\u2019d need to go deeper.\n\nHope and I considered going back and looking into other parts of the building; after all, there were dozens of other employee doors to look into. We hadn\u2019t seen those areas as children either, however, and if Hope\u2019s theory was correct, they\u2019d most likely all look pretty similar to the kitchen. Besides, I think both of us were curious what lay in these dank, unfinished parts of the structure.\n\nWhat lay through the door was a brutalist marvel. A massive room that towered off into darkness made entirely of dull, coarse concrete. Pillars sprouted from below and moved up to hold an unseen roof above, but honestly, I couldn\u2019t even be certain they started from a floor. The doorway led out onto a platform suspended between two of them, and following down with my eyes, they moved unseen into a void below us. Shining my light down into it, I couldn\u2019t help but think about the shadowy ocean beyond the shelf outside.\n\nThe platform continued forward into the dark, curving off at one point to some stairs that led up, then continued along a second bridge. Hope and I silently nodded to one another before trudging onward, single file.\n\nThe platform was large, nearly ten feet in width, so it\u2019s not like we needed to balance super carefully. Still, there were no railings, and I don\u2019t think either of us wanted to know what waited in the depths below.\n\nThe space was dreadfully eerie as we moved through, our scuffing feet on the concrete the only sound echoing through the massive chamber. That, and the ominous droning of air humming through such a large enclosed space. The worst part was the thought of what could be lurking above or below us in such a place. Things climbed the cliffs outside easily, I\u2019m sure the walls in here would pose no challenge. And if something did attack us, we were in a very precarious situation to escape.\n\nThere was another path that Hope and I noticed when we reached the stairs that continued forward, so we had to decide which way we were going. Mentally mapping the space out (a probably fruitless effort considering this place clearly didn\u2019t follow normal physics) I surmised that the path ahead was only going to take us to where the back halls of Zane\u2019s would normally be. The stairs, on the other hand, were leading away from the direction of the main building, which was the far more intriguing option.\n\nIf the playhouse was only occupying \u2018the rig\u2019 or whatever this structure really was, I wanted to get to the heart of it.\n\nCautiously, we tiptoed up the steps of the new bridge, holding each other\u2019s wrist the whole time in case one of us should lose balance. Once we reached the top, another long platform waited, but it seemed that we chose right. We could each make out a light shining in the dark all the way against the wall where the path led.\n\nAnother long walk began as my head continued its swivel. This was all seeming too easy so far. There was really nothing here\u2026 I think I had been so put off by the idea of a place from my past being here that I may have overly besmirched it in my head. This was a place that the scientists here must have operated in frequently, given their work, after all. Why wouldn\u2019t it be safe? Especially since the tower outside had been beast proofed; maybe there was nothing to worry about after all.\n\nLooking back, I wish I could have slapped myself for that thought.\n\nSoon, the light came into view, and Hope and I could see that it was some sort of keypad to a door. Unlike the one we\u2019d just passed through a bit ago, this one actually had a steel blast barrier covering its opening.\n\nOn approach, I clenched my fist in frustration, not going to be happy that we\u2019d run into yet another dead end in all of this. The more the small door reader came into view, however, the more relief I felt. It was a keycard lock, not a number pad this time, and better yet, the green LED on it was let up instead of the red one. It was already unlocked.\n\nHope gave the whole thing a scan with her flashlight, spotting the Kingfisher logo on the door as well as something else interesting. Cables and chords neatly tacked into the wall, running from the doorframe and off into the darkness toward where we\u2019d just come from. They looked awfully similar to the ones that ran out of the radio tower back at home base.\n\nWithout another moment of delay, I reached forward and pressed the button on the card reader. No point in beating around the bush.\n\nHope and I jumped, then shot our heads back at the darkness behind us as the door gave a lurch, then noisily began to grind along its rusty rails. The animatronics may have been making noise this whole time, but this was new noise, and anything in here with us would certainly be drawn to it.\n\nWe jetted through once it was open far enough for us to fit inside, my eyes inspecting the nearly foot thick steel as we passed. Considering the one in the cliff was double the size of this one, any hopes I had of blasting through it was dashed in that moment.\n\nOnce through, we resumed our lookout, praying that nothing was going to step into the beams of our flashlights. When the door finally halted with a loud, *ka-thud!,* I hastily pressed the pad on the other side to seal it once again. Only then did we finally take in the room we\u2019d stepped into.\n\nIt was lit in here, not by any overheads or bulbs, though. The room was the same hollow, plain concrete, only much more homey and clean. The stone was polished and smooth, and around the rim of the ceiling, a small crack with inlaid light strips cast a soft glow to the entire space. Ahead, there was a \u2018U\u2019 shaped spot with computers and terminals, all similar in their retro-modern style to the ones at the station. Steps on either side of the control center led down to a lowered section of the room, some sort of massive machine taking up the entire wall opposite to us.\n\nAn ominous, deep buzz filled the space as we moved farther into it, signifying a lot of power being either pumped into or out of there.\n\nHope and I were quick to go to the computers, the main source of any information, but something quickly took precedence first. Hope let out a gasp that made me jump, and I turned to where she was looking.\n\nAt the head of the room, where the large wall of tech was, there was a disturbingly gruesome sight. I had no idea what the machine was supposed to be, the whole thing an incomprehensible mass of tubes, cables, and power boxes. I could gauge enough about it and its layout, however, to know that the fancy, illuminated hole in the middle of the device must have been where some sort of core or fuse went to run the machine. The port was large, almost looking like the gate of an MRI machine, and there was a massive, metallic cylinder with dozens of ports drilled into it rolled haphazardly to the corner of the room. It looked like it was a perfect fit before it was ripped out.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t a new one inside the machine, however. There was only an empty hole that a body had been stuffed into, their legs dangling out and blood trickling down to form a puddle on the ground beneath them.\n\n\u201cHoly shit\u2026\u201d I muttered.\n\n\u201cA-Are they dead?\u201d Hope asked.\n\n\u201cWell, they don\u2019t seem alive.\u201d I returned.\n\nHope turned and moved for the stairs, but I remained up top, transfixed on the sight for a while before finally pulling my gaze down to one of the computers; a central monitor aligned with the machine. It had a bunch of numbers and percentages listed, the terms for which I didn\u2019t understand. The two that I could, however, was power and stability, the former being very high while the latter looked to be dangerously low.\n\nA warning flashed at the bottom that read *\u2018Malfunction detected: Cell unstable\u2019.*\n\n\u201cHoly crap, Hen, she\u2019s still alive!\u201d Hope gasped up to me, jarring me from my trance. My eyes shot down to her, staring at me in desperation.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I said in disbelief.\n\n\u201cGet down here\u2014she\u2019s still breathing!\u201d\n\nI did so quickly, moving to the other staircase that Hope hadn\u2019t used. As I did, I noticed something on the floor; a puddle of blood formed at the top that smeared down the steps before joining into the puddle before the machine.\n\nHope reached up to caress the poor woman's legs, then nodded to her other side, \u201cquick! Help me get her out!\u201d\n\nAs I obeyed, I quickly learned she was right. The woman was alive, her pale, drained body trembling softly with each hoarse breath she took. She seemed unconscious.\n\nHope and I grunted as we gently began to tug her out, but that\u2019s when we met resistance. There were cables jammed into her that we hadn\u2019t noticed, ones that stretched out from the core of the machine and followed her to the ground as we pulled her out.\n\nIt made my skin shiver to look at her like that. there were nine in total, to in her thighs, stomach, and ribs respectively. The last three were the most sickening, however. Two were tapped into the corners of her eyes closest the nose leaking blood down her face like black tears. The last one was buried somewhere in the back of her head just where the spine meets the skull.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck\u2026\u201d I muttered, swallowing hard.\n\n\u201cS-Should we take them out?\u201d Hope asked with panic, \u201cW-What if that kills her?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat honestly might be a mercy at this point,\u201d I said unable to breathe.\n\nGingerly, I moved my hand to one by her rib and gave it a tug. It came out with little resistance. Revealing a long, silver needle at the end. The body jolted and gasped, but didn\u2019t speak or open their half-lidded eyes. I\u2019m not even sure they could with the cables there\u2026\n\nHope began helping me pluck the remainder out, but couldn\u2019t look when I took each optic chord in my hand and gave them a tug. The noise they made upon coming out just about made me puke, and the whimpering groan that the girl released hurt me more inside than out. Finally, I looked at Hope before reaching around her neck, my hands now coated in blood, then yanking the last chord out.\n\nThe woman gasped awake with a start, her breaths sounding wet and fluid filled. She instantly began flailing her hands around, looking for anything to hold on to before finally feeling our legs to either side of her. Hope quickly lay a hand over top of hers, then gently began to coo.\n\n\u201cShh! It\u2019s okay! You\u2019re okay now! We got you.\u201d\n\n\u201cD-D-Dr. Shae?\u201d the woman gurgled desperately.\n\nHope and I made eye contact. She was Kingfisher.\n\n\u201cN-No,\u201d Hope smiled her best, \u201cMy name is Hope. We just\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI-I can\u2019t see\u2026 I can\u2019t see anything\u2014why can\u2019t I see?\u201d the woman cried, beginning to panic.\n\nHope squeezed her hand while I pressed gently to her shoulders, trying to keep her from hurting herself in the fray, \u201cYou\u2019re hurt. Just try to relax.\u201d\n\n\u201cW-Where am I?\u201d the woman asked.\n\n\u201cWe found you in that machine,\u201d Hope answered, \u201cUm, Rig 1, I think you call it?\u201d\n\n\u201cRig?\u201d the woman pondered, her voice ready to break any second, \u201cN-No\u2026 no that\u2019s not\u2026 I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\nJust then, an alarm began to go off on one of the computers upstairs, sharp and repetitive. I couldn\u2019t read what it was, obviously, but I could see the monitor rapidly flashing red. At once, the room began to sway.\n\nI don\u2019t mean rumble, like a tremor, I mean *sway.* It was like the room was being held up by wires, and somebody was swinging it back and forth like a pendulum. Hope and I stayed low as not to be knocked over by it, and the woman was so unresponsive that she didn\u2019t seem to care, but as soon as it had come, it stopped, and things were still once more.\n\nThe alarm didn\u2019t stop though, it just kept blaring. My concern becoming too much to bear, I jumped up and ran for the monitors. Slamming my hands to the sides of the computer to stop myself, I peered down at the screen, its red glow stinging my eyes.\n\n*\u2018Manifestation unstable; Evacuate immediately.\u2019*\n\n\u201cHope we need to go,\u201d I called down to her in panic.\n\n\u201cWhat about her?\u201d She asked, still holding our new friend\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cGet her up; we\u2019ll carry her,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cCan you walk?\u201d Hope asked the woman as I ran back down to her.\n\nShe didn\u2019t respond, but thankfully, she cooperated as me and my clone pulled her to her feet and propped an arm under each shoulder.\n\nThe answer was that she could barely. She dragged her feet along instinctually as we moved across the flat terrain, but once we hit stairs, it was all on Hope and I to get her up. Part of me wondered if this was simply a lost cause; she\u2019d already lost a lot of blood and was clearly near catatonic. She was probably going to die even if we did help her. Still, my conscience wouldn\u2019t let me just leave her, no matter how much danger we might be in.\n\nBesides, we came here for info, and who could give us more insight than a kingfisher scientist themselves.\n\nI reached out and jammed my thumb into the keypad button, then Hope and I panted as we waited for it to open. The alarm blaring behind us was only building my anxiety as the door dramatically slid open, but it stopped completely when I saw the other side.\n\nGone was the ominous stone obelisk we had been inside a moment ago. There was no more darkness or pillars or bridges suspended in the air. Instead, Zane\u2019s had come to find us.\n\nThe room was the jammin\u2019 jungle again, but it wasn\u2019t the original we\u2019d entered through when we got here. We were standing in the balcony part of the arcade, but where the room should have ended in a wall, the whole space mirrored itself and stretched backward again, trees, arcade cabinets and all. Any walls that did exist were crooked or turned the wrong direction, where another copy of Zane\u2019s main floor would be pasted again and run off in another path.\n\nThat was just the tame parts. Some prize counter walls rose far higher than they should, their merchandise repeating in the perfectly same pattern. When I looked off the balcony to my right, I could see several repeating floors going down for an amount of stories that I couldn\u2019t even count. Lights were shined upward into our faces, fake flora was strung where it didn\u2019t belong, and the music that once filled the place was now looping one single tune for ten seconds at a time before repeating.\n\nIt was overstimulating, wild, and downright maddening. If we were going to get out of here, we needed to do so fast before we got lost.\n\nThe issue was, we didn\u2019t know where to begin. Hope and I frantically looked around for the entrance where we\u2019d come in from, but we weren\u2019t seeing it among the mural'd walls and the fake trees. Our only option was to start moving.\n\nWe began dragging the woman along hurriedly, our eyes darting frantically for not only an exit, but any threat that might be out there. The space was too big, filled with so many abstract shapes and animatronics that everything suddenly became something hunting us. I can\u2019t explain it because nowhere like it exists on earth, but being alone in a place so vast and large\u2014it\u2019s imposing. Like the whole thing is looking down on you, ready to strike.\n\nAs we moved, still no closer to finding a way out, I finally realized an inconsistency. There was no stage. No matter how many times the building copy and pasted, the animatronic stage with Zane and his friends was nowhere to be seen. Maybe that meant that it had simply been overwritten by the rest of the structures' clutter, but if it didn\u2019t, then that meant it was the only defining feature that\u2019d be near the exit.\n\nI hit the brakes, then passed the scientist off to hope, jumping onto a nearby table and scanning around.\n\n\u201cDo you see anything?\u201d she asked.\n\nMy eyes took in every detail as I pivoted around, silently praying under my breath. My pleas were answered when, finally, I caught the top of the beige painted wall that the stage was built into, the hints of its red curtains just barely peeking out.\n\nWordlessly, I jumped down and began dragging Hope and the woman toward it.\n\nWe weaved between arcade machines and tables, keeping the stage always in my vision, no matter where we turned. We finally reached the clearing of tables for the dining area that the stage overlooked, and I was never so happy to see so many horrifying animatronics staring back at me. That joy lasted for only a few moments, however, before I took in every detail of the stage.\n\nHope wasn\u2019t looking; she was too busy spotting the wall that read, \u2018*Come jam again soon!\u2019* Above it. The exit, just a couple of building lengths away.\n\n\u201cOver there!\u201d she cried over the maddening music.\n\n\u201cHope,\u201d I asked her, my gut screaming that something was wrong, \u201cWhere is Zane?\u201d\n\nShe looked at me with a puzzled expression before her eyes turned to where I was looking and the color drained from her face.\n\n*\u201cAnd if we stick\u2014if we stick\u2014if we stick\u2014!\u201d*\n\nThe tune came screaming from over the cabinets a few rows away from us, and we ducked low fast.\n\nAbove the machines and moving toward us, there was a beam of light violently jerking and flashing around. The tune cut eventually, and the air was filled with a harsh crackle of broken audio. Various pops and snips from the song would eventually break through, but they were mostly suffocated by static until finally, they erupted at once. It was like all parts of the song had built up into one instant before every lyric and instrument unleashed in an unholy scream.\n\nThe light was getting closer. We had to move. As fast as we could, we shuffled for the other side of the dining area. I kept my head focused on the pursuer, trying to keep its position pinned, but like an idiot, I accidentally collided with a chair. It screeched across the floor with a loud scuff, and the beast behind us definitely heard it.\n\nA sharp sound like microphone feedback filled the air, and the spotlight snapped in our direction, its beam just barely cresting the top of a skeeball wall.\n\n*\u201cDance the night away\u2014dance the night away\u2014dance\u2014\"*\n\nThe whole tune once again blared out in an ear shattering instant as the creature moved faster in our direction.\n\n\u201cit\u2019s unstable\u2026\u201d I noticed the scientist muttering in a daze, \u201cI-It\u2019s unstable\u2026\u201d\n\nMy brain ran quick calculations on the situation; the speed we were dragging her, the distance to the door, and how fast we were being pursued. There was no chance we were going to make it, not while carrying this woman.\n\nThat left two options.\n\nThe first was to drop her. Leave her to whatever fate was in store when getting caught by this thing. She was already basically dead, after all; was it really immoral to leave an already dying woman to save ourselves who had much better odds?\n\nThe thought actually scared me as soon as it popped into my head. It didn\u2019t feel like me. Fight or flight really is an insane thing when staring down the barrel of a gun. I knew it was life or death, but, Jesus\u2026 How could it come to mind so fast? As if *I* wasn\u2019t an already dying woman, and as if my odds weren\u2019t any better than her\u2019s once we got out of this place. \u00a0\n\nIt was even worse when my head snapped to Hope and I saw holding the woman for dear life. She wasn\u2019t about to let her go, not for anything. She was going to go down hauling her to the finish line, or not at all. How had she come from me? She was so much better. So much more patient and kind and caring. Hope was ten times the person I was, and I *was* her. What did that say about me, then?\n\nFor all the stress of the situation, my brain found time to think.\n\nI thought about what Hope had talked to me about back at the vending machines. About what we were going to do when we got out of here. I thought about how much easier things would be if only one of us walked out.\n\nI thought about how that one didn\u2019t deserve to be me.\n\nWe were here because I dragged us both, plain and simple. If Hope had the wheel before we got here, we would have never ended up in this abyss. She would have answered the phone when Trevor called. She would have told Dad about the cancer before she left.\n\nShe wouldn\u2019t have run from it in the first place.\n\nI already had my shot at life, and I\u2019d blown it. Hope was my better half, and if anyone deserved to make it home, it was her.\n\nWhich brought me to option two. Get Hope out of here alive.\n\nI dropped the stranger's arm from my shoulder and took a large step back. Hope looked at me with panic, and I just stared back sternly.\n\n\u201cGet her out of here. I\u2019ll find a way back around,\u201d I loosely promised her before turning on my heels.\n\n\u201cHensley!\u201d she called, lurching for me with her free hand. It was in vain, however. I was already gone.\n\nDespite my brain\u2019s resistance, I forced myself to run toward the horrific sound of childhood nightmares. I was heading for a third spot that led out of the dining area when the creature I was running from finally came around the corner.\n\nZane was no longer the child friendly zebra that I had once known him to be. His fur and outer suit had gone rotten and yellow stained. It sagged off his metal bones like loose skin, torn in places and tattered beyond recognition in others. The lifeless eyes that had once been sunken into the mask were no longer visible, and the holes there were only gaping abysses. The skin around the sockets sagged deeply, giving his eyes a pained, tragic quality, and the way his jaw hung loosely from its joints made him look frozen in an eternal scream.\n\nThat was just his suit, though.\n\nBeneath was much more horrific. Gone was the metal bones that held Zane up; he was a creature of flesh and blood now. Tumorous, bumpy skin bubbled up from between the cracks in his joints and the tears in his fabric. It was cut to pieces and leaking pus from trying to grow through the hard framework of the beast. Stringy red bits of flesh hung from his all too human teeth, and I swore I could see the fingers of human hands clawing through the panels of the suits in some places.\n\nThe projector that once was hidden in Zane\u2019s torso was now crooked in his nest of fleshy guts, the stomach of his fabric torso torn open and shining it around like a searchlight.\n\nI was nearly frozen with dread as he charged into the space in a far too fluid manor, but I caught Hope frantically looking over her shoulder out of my peripheral. I could tell she hadn\u2019t wanted to leave me, but she wasn\u2019t going to waste the chance I\u2019d given her\u2014she didn\u2019t have a choice. I couldn\u2019t waste it either.\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d I yelled to the dying mascot.\n\nZane\u2019s body jerked harshly toward me, *\u201cLast forever\u2014this dance can\u2014\u201d*\n\nI turned to start running, but then something odd happened. I saw the light from the projector behind me shine against the cabinets ahead, and then everything began to hurt. Every bone, muscle and bit of tissue in my body began screaming out in agony as the beam fell onto my back, as if it were cooking my insides or something far worse.\n\nI couldn\u2019t stop a cry of pain from escaping my lips, and I tried to will my weak limbs to keep moving. It was by adrenaline alone that I could. I limped for the corner as I heard the zebra\u2019s heavy steps behind me, my heart pounding along with them. As soon as I cleared the aisle, instant relief flooded me, and I took off running again.\n\nIt didn\u2019t last long, though. Zane was fast, almost moving human like, and I was barely to the end of the lane when he spun the corner again. Once more, pain shot through me, nausea flooded my stomach, and my legs felt weak. I was mid step as it happened, and though I tried to stop it, my leg bucked from under me and I came crashing forward onto the ground.\n\n*\u201cWith me\u2014forever\u2014with me\u2014\u201d* Zane\u2019s speaker hissed and popped as he drew closer.\n\n\u2018Get up!\u2019 my brain screamed as I pressed my hands to the neon carpet and pushed. My muscles wailed in agony beneath the shifting light, however, and it felt like there were a million pounds laying on my back that I couldn\u2019t shake off.\n\nA blast of audio erupted behind me, alerting my ringing ears that Zane was close behind. I continued to fight to my feet, but it was more a courtesy to Hope than anything. My eyes were closed, and my teeth were gritted, preparing for the worst.\n\nI felt a strong, unflinching hand grab my hood and part of my hair, wrenching me backward and tossing me hard against a claw machine. The glass shattered, and my ass fell inside, resting on a nest of stuffed animals and broken shards. My eyes opened to see Zane standing before me, his hollow sockets burning more than his projector now. He leaned close and lowered himself to my level, tilting his rotting head like a curious dog.\n\nThe voice box in his stomach screamed again as I saw his mouth drop open wider. Fingers covered in blue latex gloves inched out of the dark maw, clawing the sides of his cheeks to keep his mouth open wide. A squelch came from the back of his throat, and from within, a red, fleshy tentacle began to slither out, a rancid, pungent smell filling the air.\n\nI whimpered to myself and leaned away in horror, not ready for whatever came next, but trying to accept it nevertheless. The appendage was only inches away, and I closed my eyes again when\u2014\n\n\u201c*Grrahh!\u201d* I heard a violent scream come from our left.\n\nI opened my eyes just in time to see the machine next to us come tumbling over, smashing into Zane and sending him to the floor, pinned. Hope fell into view, huffing and panting after having just leveraged the thing down using the planter behind it.\n\nBefore I could even make a sound, she jumped up and grabbed my jacket, yanking me out of the machine and to the floor. I hopped up easy without Zane\u2019s light punishing me back down, but the zebra clearly wasn\u2019t out yet. His speaker screamed profanities in the form of children\u2019s songs, and he thrashed violently to shake the heavy game box off of him.\n\nHope and I didn\u2019t wait to see if he could. We took off for the exit fast, stopping only by the entrance to pick the dying woman up that Hope had left sitting on the front lobby bench, Zane smiling smugly at us.\n\nOnce outside, we didn\u2019t stop. It was a blur as we made our way back to the radio tower. Thank God the light was still off\u2026\n\nWhen we got inside, we took our new member up to the offices and lay her down on my pile of cushions, doing our best to cover her wounds with pressure. Hope and I didn\u2019t speak a word to one another the entire time; just gasped and panted, our hearts never slowing down. I was relieved after ten minuets when we still hadn\u2019t heard any signs that Zane had followed us out.\n\nWhen they finally did, and when we were content with our patch-up job on the woman, Hope spared me a glance, and I looked back at her shamefully. I couldn\u2019t read the look in her eyes, if she\u2019d felt betrayed for almost being left alone or if she was just worried about me. Either way, it fell to the back burner when a violent wave of nausea overtook me. I buckled over onto my hands, to which Hope crawled quickly to me in comfort. She backed away fast, however, when I threw up all over the carpet.\n\nI thought it was just the stress finally releasing until I saw that it was mostly blood, a fleshy wad of meat laying right in the center.\n\nI need to rest, but I\u2019m safe and alive. I\u2019ll update you all more once I\u2019m feeling better, but if the thing laying on the ground next to me is what I think it is, I might have to take some time to get her adjusted first.\n\nI\u2019m happy to be alive, but we didn\u2019t really get to learn much in that rig, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to easily be able to go back now. I have more questions now than ever, and hopefully this poor scientist we saved can answer them when she wakes up.\n\nWell\u2026 if she wakes up, I suppose\u2026\n\nI\u2019ll talk to you all soon."},"18":{"title":"I walked my dog through the park after midnight.

I\u2019m in my bedroom, door locked, lights off. My dog\u2019s under the bed, shaking. Something followed us home. I can hear it breathing on the other side of the door.\n\nIt started maybe an hour ago.\n\nI usually walk my dog late \u2014 around 11 p.m. There\u2019s a park nearby. Old. Kind of charming. Cobblestone paths, wrought iron benches, warm yellow streetlamps that make everything feel like it belongs in a novel. There\u2019s also a big field next to it \u2014 always empty at night, just open space and the hum of the city in the distance.\n\nTonight I got distracted and left later than usual \u2014 12:10 a.m.\n\nThe second I stepped into the park, I knew something was off. The lamps were out. I didn\u2019t even know they\u00a0*turned off.*\u00a0It was pitch-black, except for the faint spill of streetlight behind me. The whole park looked\u2026 wrong. Not just darker \u2014\u00a0*emptier.*\u00a0Like the air itself had gone stale.\n\nI figured we\u2019d do a quick loop and head back. My dog, normally fearless, kept close to my side.\n\nWe were near the duck pond when I heard it.\n\n**Crunch.**\n\nLike a boot on brittle leaves. I stopped. It stopped.\n\nI turned \u2014 nothing.\n\nKept walking. Faster this time.\n\n**Crunch.**  \n**Shuffle.**\n\nMy dog froze. Hackles up. Tail tucked.\n\nI turned again \u2014 and that\u2019s when I saw it.\n\nAcross the field, just past the tree line. Something standing there. Unmoving. Too tall to be a person. Too still.\n\nIts arms hung too low. Legs slightly bent like it had too many joints. Its head was tilted \u2014\u00a0*not like it was curious, more like it didn\u2019t know how necks worked.*\n\nI whispered, \u201cCome on,\u201d and started backing away.\n\nIt stepped forward.\n\nThat\u2019s all I needed.\n\nI turned and ran.\n\nThen I heard\u00a0**it**\u00a0run.\n\nNot footsteps. Something worse \u2014 fast, irregular, limbs hitting the pavement like hooves made of bone and rope. My dog sprinted ahead, leash flapping behind her. I didn\u2019t look back. I\u00a0*couldn\u2019t*.\n\nEvery corner I turned, I expected to see it gaining.\n\nI didn\u2019t stop until we were home.\n\nI slammed the door. Locked it. Deadbolt too. I collapsed inside, heart punching through my chest.\n\nThat\u2019s when the doorbell rang.\n\nI\u2019ve got one of those smart doorbells with a camera feed. Pulled up the app. My phone was on 3%.\n\nAnd there it was.\n\n**Not on the porch.**  \nJust off-frame.  \n*Peeking around the edge.*\n\nIt didn\u2019t have a face. Not really. The skin was stretched too tight, like someone vacuum-sealed flesh over a skull. The mouth looked like it was stuck mid-scream. But there were\u00a0*no eyes*\u00a0\u2014 just hollow dents.\n\nIt was holding something.\n\nA\u00a0**collar.**\n\nLooked\u00a0*exactly*\u00a0like my dog\u2019s.\n\nBut she was still under the bed.\n\nThe feed glitched. Froze. My phone died.\n\nNow I\u2019m here. In my room. Lights off. Laptop open.\n\nAnd just now \u2014 I looked at the base of my door.\n\nThere\u2019s a\u00a0**shadow under it.**  \nToo long. Too still. Like someone lying down, watching.\n\nEvery few seconds, it moves. Just slightly. Like it\u2019s breathing. Or\u00a0**waiting**.\n\nCrunch. Shuffle. Crunch.\n\nIt\u2019s not pacing. It\u2019s\u00a0**learning**.\n\nLaptop\u2019s on 7%.\n\nI\u2019m going to hide in the wardrobe. Bring the flashlight. Maybe it\u2019ll help. Maybe it won\u2019t.\n\nIf anyone sees this\u2026\n\nDon\u2019t walk in the park after midnight.\n\nAnd if you hear something behind you \u2014  \n**Don\u2019t stop. Don\u2019t turn. And whatever you do\u2026 don\u2019t open the door.**"},"19":{"title":"The Missing Parking Lot (Part 1)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kk58co\/the_missing_parking_lot_part_1\/","flair":"Series","author":"0bvi0","selftext":"A friend and I started a Youtube channel over a year ago that is on an indefinite hiatus due to something we stumbled into and now find ourselves involved in. We both enjoyed watching videos of urban exploration, \u201curbex\u201d as it's known in short. Being the first in perhaps decades to walk inside a long forgotten hidden space was exciting to us.\u00a0\n\nWith a newfound excuse to hangout, Andy and I kept busy and did some research over equipment, what to be prepared for, and places of interest in our area. Buying the best gear we could find within our budget, we were off recording making our own videos soon after.\u00a0\n\nWe went to various locations that piqued our interest including a closed off parking garage, abandoned overgrown house and an old run down apartment complex to name a few. Looking back it was this complex that made us start to see urban exploring as more than a hobby.\n\nThe complex was 3 stories high and very run down. It felt and looked like we were in a horror movie as we recorded. Locations were getting a little repetitive for us at the time and this was the change of scenery we had been looking for. Unfortunately, owners had just installed cameras near the entrance we had failed to notice.\n\nWe were kicked out 20 min in by police.\u00a0\n\nCop\u2019s asked us for our I.D\u2019s and addressed us with our formal names Andres and Pedro which Andy particularly disliked. We told them we were photographers and they seemed fine about us snooping around but said the place was falling apart and was soon to be demolished and fenced; we were asked to leave for our own safety.\n\nThe video of us at the complex and getting caught by police got us some actual views and subscribers, even though it was our shortest upload yet. Suddenly hooked and in need of help we hit up Dario, a mutual friend to operate another camera and give our videos more perspectives.\n\nNo longer were we after simple dilapidated places. We were now in search of places that we were most likely not allowed to be in. Unique locations that might be unsafe, that could get us fined and or worse, all to keep our viewers invested.\n\nAn old church rumored to be haunted was next. Members of a skate park blocks away from the forgotten place of worship mentioned how they had often seen a ghostly figure there, and very recently. Lying or not, thanks to them we got a good setup for the video with footage of eye witness accounts and proceeded to go check the place out.\u00a0\n\nThis ghost turned out to be nothing more than a homeless man wearing an oversized sweatshirt. Even then the footage we recorded wasn\u2019t any less terrifying. The bum had chased us out and broken through the rotted floor. Falling a full story through on the basement floor below, we assumed he was seriously hurt.\n\nLooking down through the ruptured wooden flooring Andy focused his light on the man\u2019s face, who was seemingly unconscious. Suddenly covering his sight with one hand and clearly drunk, the man got up and started yelling obscenities. All while vigorously giving us the finger with both hands.\u00a0\n\nGlad he was unhurt, we chuckled, told him sorry and that we would leave a flashlight behind for him. We left it by the door along with some cash and the man again yelled for us to get out. We ran back to the car before he finished walking up the basement steps.\n\nThis upload was eventually our most lucrative and the video that put us on the youtube algorithm with many viewers watching weeks after upload. The top comment mentioned how considering it was a church, the man had landed in a very fitting position with his arms spread to either side and legs close together. This made us laugh.\n\nIn spite of this video's success most of our audience accused it of being staged. This frustrated the three of us but we decided to run with it, whichever way it was perceived, they still tuned in.\n\nOur last stop to date and the origin of our current dilemma started at an abandoned junkyard.\n\nTrying to break the routine with the goal to go on a hike right after, it was located over an hour away from us, surrounded by forest. There were a few houses on the way but the place was in the middle of nowhere, the closest gas station was 20 minutes out. On our way early we got there before noon.\u00a0\n\nWith our gloves on, we climbed in through the old front gate that had fallen inwards and was leaning on a few cars. Once inside we made our way towards a small house in the premises that we could maybe check out; taking good footage of the few cars we recognized and some that had been almost completely swallowed by foliage.\u00a0\n\nChecking the place out we suddenly heard a car coming and hid behind a few cars looking out and recording towards the fence.\u00a0\n\nThe three of us then saw a white truck blasting country music park near the fallen gate. Out walked a heavy set man, after he stepped out we saw his dog jump off. It looked to be a bully breed of some sort, the dog started barking the minute it stepped out of the truck.\n\n\u201cWhat is it boy?\u201d, the man asked the dog. He took a quick look at his surroundings before reaching in his truck and pulling out a rifle.\u00a0\n\nThe dog clearly had our scent and we needed to get out soon. The man whistled as he walked around the fence, hearing the rattle of keys, we started to quietly walk back the way we came. The screech of a gate being open as the dog continued barking was what made us take off running.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey\u201d!! The man yelled when he saw us. I looked back and saw a cloud of dirt form as his dog came running after us.\n\nPanicking we each took off in separate directions.\n\nDario jumped over the fence from the rooftop of an old truck and hurt his ankle on the landing. I climbed over the fence so fast a nail caught on my palm under my thumb and cut my hand open. Landing on some grass outside the fence I held my hand tightly to stop the bleeding.\u00a0\n\nAndy tore his jeans open when he climbed up two stacked cars. The dog then jumped and bit his jean threads. Trying to pull him down, Andy's pants luckily ripped further until the dog managed to rip the whole back off one of his jean legs, revealing his boxers.\u00a0\n\nAndy continued climbing with his shredded jeans and jumped and ran over a section of the fence that had just about fallen over, leaning similarly to the gate we had entered through. When he made it out he yelled at the man that we weren\u2019t stealing and meant no harm. That we were just photographers, he held out his camera as he caught his breath.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care who you are, I just bought this property and don\u2019t want to see you creepin\u2019 round here\u201d. The man said after laughing loudly. He then called his barking dog a good boy and continued laughing.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYa'll better take off now fore\u2019 I call the police\u201d, he yelled pointing at us with his rifle in one hand before walking out of view into the small house.\n\nI got up as Andy walked towards us shaking his head and cursing. He was still breathing heavily, with what was left of his pants swaying in the wind. We both saw that Dario had still been recording.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI recorded the whole thing boys\u201d he said through the pain as Andy helped him up and walked him over to our car. Taking out the first aid kit we patched up my hand best we could.\u00a0\n\nNeedless to say we called off our hike and headed to the nearest hospital. Unfortunately that meant driving further into the town, as I was bleeding quite a bit. I was treated quickly and didn't need any stitches, just surgical sutures and a tetanus shot.\n\nIt took Dario much longer to get treated and x-rayed, while he was in a lot of pain, it was just a badly sprained ankle. Andy had another pair of pants that he changed into. Our past ventures had taught us to bring extra sets of clothes just in case. During the time we got treated he scouted out the area and got us some decent food to eat.\u00a0\n\nWhen Andy came back to the hospital with the food, the TV in the lobby was tuned to the local news mentioning the identities of some teenagers who had last been seen a week earlier. Search efforts were taking place nearby with many volunteers and family of the victims asking for help.\n\nWaiting in line to be asked who he was visiting to be let in, he overheard some folks talk about lesser known disappearances from many years back, majority of which still remain unsolved. How people used to refer to the town as a small disappearance hot spot until the major improvements in infrastructure and arrival of GPS helped with traversal.\n\n\u201cAvoid evening and late night travel is what people used to tell me,\u201d an older gentleman said.\n\n\u201cBoth on foot and by car\u201d A lady added.\u00a0\n\n\u201cConsidering the cars of most local victims also vanished I would agree\u201d another lady replied.\n\n\u201cI was always told growing up to behave or whatever was in the woods would come get me. I'm still a little scared to this day\u201d. Another man said. Some laughed at his remark as he was quite obviously the oldest one in the conversation.\u00a0\n\nTheories were thrown out and many attributed the disappearances to an arrested serial killer that frequented a nearby area. Evidence was never found to suggest this but many believed it to be true. It was at this point Andy got the idea to come back for our next video, he wouldn't need to convince us, we would have plenty of reason to return.\u00a0\n\nConversation was still ongoing when Andy was eventually allowed up to Dario\u2019s room where he and I waited for the food. By the time we ate and were out of the hospital it was past 3pm.\u00a0\n\nBack in the car we finally went over footage of the three cameras. Dario had done well in recording, his footage was the one that clearly showed what we had just gone through. The way Andy\u2019s pants ripped and how he almost got pulled down by the dog reminded me of a Charlie Chaplin film.\u00a0\n\nDario and I barely managed to keep a straight face and not laugh, Andy cursed at the dog as he watched it bite his pants.\u00a0\n\nQuickly brainstorming ideas for the upload, we planned to show pictures of both my healing cut and Dario\u2019s swollen ankle in the video. Taking a long break was unavoidable but at least it was harder to claim it as fake.\u00a0\n\nWith our injuries treated and feeling better we decided to check the area out further before heading home.\u00a0\n\nAndy had seen places that might work for future videos. Intending to drive by an old warehouse he took a wrong turn and we ended up at a beautiful forested suburban area taking in the scenic sights and recording while driving through.\n\n\u201cThis makes up for our lost hike,\u201d Dario said as he took footage of our surroundings while in the car.\u00a0\n\nAndy then began to tell us about the conversation he heard in the hospital and the news of the missing teens as he drove. Forced to turn around a few times after hitting some dead ends in the maze-like neighborhood, we were suddenly pulled over by an officer.\n\nAndy had his license and registration in hand before the officer walked up to our car. After running it through the database and not finding anything of note he told us he had stopped us because a local resident had seen us driving back and forth and grown suspicious of us.\u00a0\n\n\u201cMost homeowners in the area are wealthy, retired, and very wary of strangers. Many houses are vacation homes and empty for extended periods of time. Local properties make for perfect targets.\u201d he told us.\u00a0\n\nOfficer then proceeded to do some small talk asking what we were up to and where we were headed.\u00a0We told him we were photographers looking for a good spot.\n\nConversation was going well until he saw my bandaged hand and asked me how I got hurt. I had to think for a second before I told him I simply fell hiking; he read my bluff and asked me to step out of the car.\u00a0\n\nThings escalated quickly and before I knew it, I was in handcuffs.\n\nAndy and Dario tried asking the officer why I was arrested while I was in his cruiser. The ranger just told them they were both also suspects and called for backup. Due to limited resources in the rural area they were to be escorted in their car to the ranger station 30 min away while I rode in the back of the cruiser.\u00a0\n\nI was taken to the ranger station and put in an interrogation room. I waited there for an hour before an officer came in and asked me where I was 2 nights before.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI was at work away from this stupid town\", I told him before asking for a lawyer. The officer then said a lawyer was on the way for me before walking out.\u00a0\n\n15 minutes later my lawyer walked in. Told me to call him Frank and proceeded to tell me the details and what I, along with my friends, was believed to be involved in. One of the recent break-ins had apparently happened 2 nights before we showed up. The suspect had left a blood trail that started by the broken window of the house.\n\nIt looked like the culprit had most likely cut themselves on exiting the premises and ran into the forest with the stolen goods.\n\nI told Frank that my injury had happened that morning and that I could get doctor's notes and proof of hospital visits from just a few hours earlier. He wrote that down on a notepad.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIs there anything else you can tell me, Pedro? The police report states that you and your friends are photographers. Are there any pictures, any proof that might show where you and your friends were recently?\u201d He asked.\n\nI thought to myself for a bit. I didn\u2019t realize I was spacing out until he started talking again.\n\n\u201cIf nothing comes to mind I\u2019m afraid we will have to perform and wait for blood samples to come through to see if you are indeed a match, that could take anywhere from 2 days to a week. Keep in mind you will probably have to wait in town, I\u2019ll do my best to stop them from keeping you in a holding cell\u201d.\n\n\u201cI know you and your friends are a ways out from home. Do your best to clear your mind and think of something, okay Pedro?\u201d. He asked.\n\nNo way I\u2019m staying in this town for another day I thought to myself before telling my lawyer the truth.\n\nI told Frank that we weren't just photographers. I told him we were urban explorers that had snuck into a local junkyard and that's how I had gotten hurt.\u00a0\n\n\u201cLook Pedro this doesn\u2019t help your case in any way, was it private property? \" he asked.\n\n\u201cYes, I cut myself jumping over the fence\u201d, I answered.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me you didn't break into the house you're being framed for but you broke into a nearby junkyard?\u201d he then asked.\n\n\u201cUmm, yeah\u201d I answered, realizing I sounded more guilty now than before.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m assuming your friends have proof you were there this morning?\u201d he asked, taking notes.\n\n\u201cYes, we actually have a few recordings, even one that shows how everything happened\u201d. I said\n\n\u201cOkay I will get with them, I\u2019ll take a look at that recording and see if that helps your case. You hang tight I\u2019ll be back in a bit\u201d. Frank then walked out while I waited and eventually fell asleep.\n\nI woke up to an officer shaking my shoulder and telling me I was free to wait out in the lobby. I could tell he was holding in a laugh. My friends were happy to see me out and said that they had been waiting for 2 hours while my case was being processed. Both had also received a pat down and officers had inventory searched all our backpacks.\n\nWhen asked about the recordings, they had tried to play dumb but Frank said he knew about them and they were likely the fastest way my charges could be dropped. Once the videos were analyzed in a private office room they could hear how it made my lawyer as well as a few officers laugh and completely change their demeanor.\u00a0\n\nBoth my lawyer as well as the station had made copies of the recordings for future reference in the case. I\u2019m sure they all would have had a blast if they were ever able to show the video to friends and family.\u00a0\n\nAs we caught up, Frank walked out of a room along with an officer and said that thanks to our recordings my charges for breaking and entering\/theft were being dropped. They were just to perform a police search on our vehicle and a welfare check on our \u201cfriend\u201d the junkyard owner.\n\nThe car inspection took less than 20 min, it was the check up on the junkyard that took longer as the owner was not there. Cops performed a full survey of the premises, concluded everything was in order and reported back to the station.\u00a0\n\nFrank again spoke to us and said we were no longer suspects in the case, but I was likely still in hot water for lying to an officer and trespassing if the junkyard owner decides to file a report. We waited in the station for another hour before we were finally told we could leave and handed back our car keys.\u00a0\n\nOfficers didn\u2019t even try to hide it, they had gotten a kick out of Dario\u2019s Recording and said that it had made their week. I\u2019m assuming it was the reason all our charges were dropped so soon. The only thing was we could not upload or do anything with the footage until further notice.\u00a0\n\nFollowing Frank out we thanked him, he gave us his card to keep in touch if anything else came of the proceedings. As we spoke outside a few officers ran out of the station, each took off in separate cruisers.\n\n\u201cI wonder what\u2019s going on\u201d, Andy asked. Frank then mentioned the teenagers that had gone missing a week before and that maybe something had come up in the search that was currently being held.\n\nFrank then said he had to go, shook our hands and wished us good luck. He walked away giving Andy a pat on the back and smirk telling him to bring proper equipment next time he goes climbing.\n\n\u201cTake care now, you boys drive safe\u201d. He said getting in his car and driving off.\n\n\u201cGod I\u2019m never gonna hear the end of it once we upload that video, I don\u2019t even want to upload it anymore\u201d. Andy said as we saw Frank drive off.\n\n\u201cOh we\u2019re uploading it no matter what, you getting your pants ripped by that dog was the best thing that happened to us today\u201d. I replied.\n\n\u201cNot a chance I\u2019m letting my footage go to waste\u201d. Dario Added.\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Andy said, walking to our car. Dario waddled his way, following us on his crutches.\u00a0\n\nFinally back in our car it was just about 8pm when we started our drive back home. The night had an eerie vibe with fog beginning to form. I took some pain medication to stop my hand from pulsating and hurting. The three of us were hungry and tired at this point and just wanted to have a relaxing normal drive.\n\nIt was gonna take about 3 hours to get back home thanks to the \u201cdetours\u201d we had endured. Both Dario and I would have to call off from work the next day. Debating over getting a hotel or driving back home, ultimately we decided on driving back home due to our injuries and unpleasant experiences in the town.\n\nAndy was okay with driving the full 3 hours as he was off the next day and said he had taken a decent nap while in the station. He of course didn\u2019t have much of a choice, Dario and I were still injured.\u00a0\n\nI was starting to doze off when we came to a full stop and I opened my eyes to the blinking lights of 2 police cruisers. They were parked blocking the road in front of us.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d Dario asked from the backseat.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou guys see that?\u201d Andy asked as he looked out his window to our left. Out in the distance we could see some parked cars and flashlights flickering and bouncing through the trees. We had run into the search party for the missing teens.\n\nStill looking to our left, we were suddenly startled by the tapping of my passenger seat window. It was one of the officers that had run out of the station as we spoke to Frank outside earlier. I then rolled my window down.\n\n\u201cSorry gentlemen this road is blocked, you are gonna have to go back the way you came and take a detour.\u201d He said leaning on our car. \u201cYou all have a physical map handy?\u201d he then asked.\n\n\u201cYeah I think so\u201d Andy said, pointing for me to pull it out of the glove compartment.\n\nThe officer asked us where we were headed, then wrote and drew on the map. He told us phone reception was usually very bad in the area and gave us directions for an old logging route to take. It was a dirt road primarily used for hiking during the day, a few officers knew of it and used it from time to time.\u00a0\n\nThe road ended on an uphill hard right turn that would be harder to see at night; if we stayed at or below the speed limit we'd be fine. We were skeptical but based on where we were headed the officer calculated it would save us 20 minutes. The alternative was driving more than half an hour back around the town.\n\nNormally there\u2019d be no reason to take that road at night but he recognized our predicament and would allow it.\u00a0\n\nBefore turning the car around Andy asked the officer if the flashlights in the distance were the search party. Officer confirmed it was them and that the roadblock was ongoing because of evidence they found. Said some volunteers decided to continue the search later than usual hoping something else would turn up in the area.\n\nAfter thanking the officer we drove off towards the shortcut eventually driving by a forensic van. Our suspicion that the search party had likely found a body being all but confirmed. We were obligated to turn on our high beams at this point as the fog was getting much worse.\u00a0\n\nI opened maps on my phone for another perspective and just like the officer had said there was no record of such a road, it was only when I switched to satellite view that I was able to see it. Following the officers directions as well as my phone we slowed down after driving by a closed campground entrance and kept an eye out.\n\n\u00a0Sure enough the small road suddenly came up on our left.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIs that enough signs or what?\u201d I said as we stopped and looked at the entrance. There were 4 signs posted: A drive with your lights on, a very old logging grounds sign, a fog area sign, and a subject to flooding sign.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe have our high beams on, we already knew it was a logging ground road, we can clearly see the fog, and the area is completely dry\u201d, Andy said pointing at each sign he referenced as he spoke.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine, this baby\u2019s 4 wheel drive\u201d. He added tapping the dashboard. Dario and I agreed and we drove inside the unknown road presuming everything would be okay.\u00a0\n\nWe entered the dirt road and the darkness around us increased drastically giving the illusion that the forest was closing in, slowly swallowing us. The dirt and dust combined with the fog was severely affecting our visibility. All three of us were fully concentrated on the drive looking straight ahead.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see anything! I feel like I\u2019m driving recklessly and I\u2019m not even hitting 20 mph!\u201d Andy said loudly. The crunching of the dirt and bouncing and rattling of the car seemed to get worse all of a sudden.\n\n\u201cHoly shit, This is making my ankle hurt\u201d Dario said from the middle of the back seat, he was holding on to both front headrests to keep himself more steady. We were all still focused on the drive looking forward when in an instant a large black mass moved in front of us from the right.\n\n\u201cWatch Out!\u201d I yelled as it first came into view from my passenger window.\n\nAndy hit the brakes and simultaneously honked. The car came to a full stop in just enough time to avoid collision, we looked at whatever was in front of us intently.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d Andy asked in a frightened tone. Whatever it was it moved slightly revealing its horns and we realized we were looking at the rear end of an elk.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big boy,\u201d Andy said, still holding his chest from the scare.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYo Pedro, let's try to get good pics of it,\u201d Dario said, handing me my camera.\n\nI struggled to turn on the camera but snapped a couple shots of the animal.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t gonna get very good shots of the animal with all this fog, plus I can\u2019t really operate my camera well with my bandaged hand\u201d I said while still taking pics.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m mostly getting its ass, I can barely see its horns and head\u201d Dario said while also getting shots.\n\n\u201cJust get out and take some better pictures of it you guys\u201d Andy said jokingly.\n\n\u201cOh hell no I\u2019m not going out there\u201d I answered.\n\n\u201cAre you crazy, I can\u2019t even stand?\u201d Dario asked mid laugh.\u00a0\n\nAndy also laughed and again honked at the animal. It was seemingly startled by the horn except it didn't budge; it just stayed there looking on, frozen in shock. With its back still towards us and facing forward, it turned its head to look behind itself and we saw its eyes catch the light of our high beams.\u00a0\n\n\u201cCome on big guy, buzz off, get off the road!\u201dAndy said loudly as he switched the car headlights on and off a few times to see if it would finally make the elk move.\u00a0\n\nIt seemed to work as the animal continued down the road for a few feet and then made a left turn into the forest, out of the range of our headlights. Just like it came into view it was gone in an instant.\n\nWe inched forward, moving even slower than before. Dario joked they should add a wildlife crossing sign to the road entrance and we laughed. None of us said a word for a few minutes. I could sense a bit of tension forming between us, like we were all understandably anticipating something else to happen.\u00a0\n\nIt had been a rough day and we were all understandably on edge. Laughing at our predicaments gave me relief and helped us tremendously. The three of us just wanted to get back to an area we recognized, sick of being on the road in an unfamiliar place far away from home.\u00a0\n\nFor a second I lamented taking the shady road after everything that had happened to us but I recognized we were desperate to get out of this town and save time. Looking for my phone that had flown out of my hands when we hit the brakes, I found it stuck between my seat and the right side of the car.\u00a0\n\nAfter I managed to yank it out I tried to access maps and quickly realized I had no service of any kind. I asked Andy and Dario to check their phones and they also had no service. My anxiety only grew as I unfolded the paper map and we continued onwards.\n\n\n\n"},"20":{"title":"There is no Costa Rosa","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kjljov\/there_is_no_costa_rosa\/","flair":null,"author":"Saturdead","selftext":"For many years, I didn\u2019t want to tell this story. It is painful, embarrassing, and to a greater extent \u2013 unbelievable. But if I\u2019m ever to move on, I need to put this behind me for good. So yes, I\u2019m gonna talk about Costa Rosa.\n\n\n\nA lot of you are probably gonna go \u201cwhat\u2019s Costa Rosa?\u201d. And yeah, that\u2019s fair. It was a niche hashtag that circulated certain social media circles back in 2017. I was a sort of background community manager for a group of influencers. No big mainstream names, but they had a decent set of followers. They were all into the more obscure corners of the web, focusing on a particular age group, a social issue, or some kind of special interest. These were people who got sponsorships by staying content-approachable, sponsor-friendly, and \u201cauthentic\u201d.\n\nIn truth, they had all media coordination groups with managers, stylists, and a whole slew of background people making sure their content was filtered and greenlit. I was part of this background team.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor obvious reasons, I can\u2019t say their names. Some of them are still around, in one way or another. Others I will refrain from mentioning out of respect for their loved ones.\n\nNow, Costa Rosa.\n\nFor weeks, me and the coordinators had been running into a problem. There was something we called an \u201cexpectation of excellence\u201d, and it was getting impractical to coordinate localized trips and bookings for content creators on different continents. We had a vegan guy in Cardiff and a friendly middle-aged kinda-sorta red state baker in Tennessee \u2013 as you can imagine, we had to do a lot of varied work. So after weeks of dwindling interest, we had to funnel attention into something new.\n\nSomeone had this idea of a joint resort. We reached out to various locations about sponsorship deals, and in return, we\u2019d make their place look gorgeous. It was the kind of push where we could put all eggs in the same basket and get some great content out of it. Problem was \u2013 no one was biting.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThen someone said;\n\n\u201cDoes it have to be a *real* place?\u201d\n\nIt sounded like a stupid question. I mean, it had to be. You can\u2019t go somewhere that doesn\u2019t exist. But the more you think about it, you can make anything as real as you want it.\n\n\u201cWe could say it\u2019s exclusive,\u201d someone said. \u201cInvite only.\u201d\n\n\u201cA private island kinda thing,\u201d another chimed in. \u201cWe just need a name.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd an area. Some central American island. Think Belize, Panama, Sri Lanka\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSri Lanka is in Africa.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one cares.\u201d\n\nWe finally settled on a fictional island off the coast of Costa Rica. All we needed was a name. I\u2019d been quiet up until that point, and the silence was getting to me. So I just threw it out there.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s call it Costa Rosa.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Pink Coast was our make-or-break project. We came up with all kinds of crazy ideas. We had a food guy who pulled out three kinds of crab recipes and called them \u201ccultural secrets\u201d of the locals. One of our video guys added that we could edit certain videos to make the beach look pink.\n\nWe came up with names for streets, hiking trails, local fishing boats \u2013 all of it. We made a list of every fruit you could find on the island. We made it all up, just so that if anyone asked, we\u2019d have the answers. It got to the point where people were loudly clapping at each other\u2019s lies. I vividly remember when someone came up with the idea of a bioluminescent waterfall, saying it could be the proof of the island\u2019s \u201cbeautiful biodiversity\u201d.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not gonna lie \u2013 I was into it. This was the kind of business we were in, and Costa Rosa was this huge, breathing dollar sign. And of course our influencers would be into it; you just had to frame it all in a way that made them look like heroes, inspiring the \u201clittle people\u201d to step out of their comfort zone and aim for the stars.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI was having some trouble privately though. I graduated college with a bachelor\u2019s in communication \u2013 that\u2019s where I met my fianc\u00e9e. But I sort of stumbled over the influencer business. I\u2019ve always been a bit pear shaped, and working with these larger-than-life beautiful people made me feel like I was part of the in-crowd. I\u2019d never had that, which was something my fianc\u00e9e couldn\u2019t really understand.\n\nWe got into a ton of fights about it. When you work from your phone, you\u2019re never really off the clock. You see something cool when you\u2019re out shopping? Tag it, send it. You hear about some interesting place downtown? Check it out, talk to the owner, get a foot in the door. People around me got tired of never really just hanging out with me, and in hindsight, I can see why. They were always the third wheel.\n\nBut when our first Costa Rosa content was launched, things turned bad. We were having some of the worst fights ever. I thought it was inspiring \u2013 he thought it was fraud. I argued that we weren\u2019t selling anything, but he argued we were selling a lifestyle. Either way, it got to the point where we postponed the wedding. I suppose it was a good thing we\u2019d been too lazy to renew our passports, or we\u2019d be out thousands of dollars from a non-refundable honeymoon.\n\nWe didn\u2019t officially separate, but the distance from the couch to the bed seemed longer every day.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn about two weeks, the whole project went off the rails. Sure, we were getting clicks, and we had a couple of sponsorships lined up, but there were some things we hadn\u2019t anticipated. For example, there was another group in eastern Europe that hijacked the whole thing. They made their own videos with their own influencers going to \u201cCosta Rosa\u201d. They never even talked to us about it, they just stole the whole thing. They weren\u2019t even discrete about it.\n\nWe had a couple of other small-time copycats. Some people mentioned turning down an invitation to go there on Twitter. Others mentioned how they\u2019d been \u201ccontacted\u201d but refused to go for one reason or another. There was this one London-based singer who claimed she was going there, only to cancel at the last minute and showing her fans a \u201cgift bag\u201d from\u201d the organizers\u201d on a livestream.\n\nBut somehow, things got worse.\n\n\u00a0\n\nScams. Fake raffles and lotteries. \u201cLike this video to get a chance to go to Costa Rosa\u201d kind of stuff. And it was moving some real money too. We were panicking \u2013 we\u2019d never signed off on that. Our talent hadn\u2019t either. But what were we supposed to do? If we came clean, our careers were over.\n\nOne in the team came up with an idea. We could go somewhere that is as close to Costa Rosa as possible and show \u201cthe real thing\u201d. That way we had our backs covered. We could point to the map and say that was it. Sure, we could admit taking a few artistic liberties, but it would cover our tracks.\n\nAnd somehow, we found the perfect spot.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI didn\u2019t know the real name of the place. We all agreed to just call it \u201cCosta Rosa\u201d as to not slip up. It all went by so fast. There was a group call, something about boarding tickets, someone waiting to pick me up. I lost my luggage at the airport, but there was no time to stop. All I had to do was get there, and everything would sort itself out.\n\nI slept through the flight and mumbled through the transfer. There was a boat somewhere. Temperature shifted and the language on the signs looked different from home. And within a few hours, I was standing with my bare feet buried in the pink sands.\n\nThey really were pink.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow, we\u2019d made up a lot of stuff about Costa Rosa. Sure, the pink beaches was one thing, but there was also the fog. We\u2019d called it a refreshing summer phenomenon. A heavy fog that rolled in from the coast every morning; causing this white, almost cyan, mist.\n\nBut there really was a mist on that island. I could barely see my hands in front of me as I stepped through it.\n\nSeeing this place for the first time felt like a Disney movie. You can\u2019t really believe spots like this really exist. It was almost exactly as we\u2019d described it. Pink sands, fruit trees, colorful birds. No bioluminescent waterfall though. Then again, those were only seen at night.\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe how lucky we\u2019d been. This might as well have been the real thing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe were a group of sixteen people, four of which were influencers. The rest of us were all behind the camera. We were all saying the same thing \u2013 it felt like stepping into a dream. It was too perfect, and we knew perfect. Perfect was our *business*.\n\nThere was no one there to greet us, so we didn\u2019t know where to go. Our bags must\u2019ve been taken to the hotel. We figured they\u2019d gotten the arrival time wrong, so we spent most of the afternoon just relaxing by the water, watching the tides roll in to tickle our feet. It really was beautiful.\n\nI remember dozing off for a bit as the others tried to get the hotel manager on the line. Someone suggested we walked, but we had camera equipment and not a lot of patience. And, well, we weren\u2019t in a hurry.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt was mid-afternoon when Jay woke me up. Jay was one of our cameramen, a south-east Asian guy with these big round glasses. No matter what you said, he\u2019d just nod and smile. Not because he didn\u2019t understand, but because he\u2019d found out early on that it was best to just kinda go with the flow. Lean into the vibe.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s people,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re heading out.\u201d\n\nI groaned and got up, only to see a dozen strangers flocking around our team. A lot of smiles, hugs, and welcomes. Pleasant people. Then I realized \u2013 these people didn\u2019t live on this island. They weren\u2019t even crew.\n\nThey were tourists.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re here!\u201d someone yelled.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a scam,\u201d another said. \u201cHand to God, I thought it was a scam, I did.\u201d\n\nPeople were coming up to shake our hands and chat. All of them were viewers of our content, in one way or another. They recognized our talent immediately, who shot me a half-smiling \u201cplease get me out of here\u201d kind of look. We took charge and sorted things out, making sure we all got some space to breathe, and making it clear that we appreciated the enthusiasm \u2013 but that this was a private occasion.\n\nThe tourists didn\u2019t seem to mind. They weren\u2019t coming down from their high anytime soon.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re here,\u201d one said. \u201cIt really feels like a dream.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe walked. There was no point in standing around, and we needed some space from the tourists. I couldn\u2019t believe how bad our luck was. This place had been thoroughly vetted, and the chance of someone else finding it the same time we did was astronomical. It wasn\u2019t just unlikely \u2013 it was close to impossible.\n\nIt was one of our talents, Kim, that finally spoke up. A short woman in her early 30\u2019s with a big personality - she had this marriage advice slash calisthenics-themed channel.\n\n\u201cCan whoever booked this just call the hotel?\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been hours.\u201d\n\nEveryone stayed quiet. We didn\u2019t have a clear answer. We all just kinda pointed at one another, and figured someone who didn\u2019t show up was the one who made the booking. But it left a strange thought \u2013 this had all gone *very* fast.\n\nSuspiciously so.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe spent most of the afternoon and the early evening following a long road, picking fruit straight from the trees, and drinking from the island springs. We met a couple more tourists, but they didn\u2019t seem to recognize us. They didn\u2019t even speak the language. They were just sort of happy to be there.\n\nIt was all so fantastic. You didn\u2019t feel tired, no matter how long you walked. You didn\u2019t get that hungry or thirsty. There was fresh fruit hanging from low branches, and exotic smells coming from blooming flowers. There was this one blue-looking sunflower that was about as tall as me just off the side of the road.\n\nEverything just felt right. Promoting a place like that would be the simplest thing in the world. But there was also a strange quality to it \u2013 and I couldn\u2019t help but to notice it affecting the others.\n\nI first saw it on Jay. He was looking down at his hand, slowly opening and closing his fingers. Like he was trying to sense something. When he noticed me looking, he reached out and put his hand on my cheek. I pulled back a little.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were real.\u201d\n\nI laughed it off, and he did too.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe never found the hotel. We did find a few road signs, but no one was paying enough attention to care. The roads had the same names as those we\u2019d brainstormed in our group chat. Some of them hadn\u2019t even been made public.\n\nAs the sun began to set, the island changed. We could see a faint glow coming from the water, and there was a serenade of hissing insects in the distance. Even at its coldest, Costa Rosa was comfortable. Some folks stripped down into their underwear. It all had this sort of spring break kind of vibe, like we weren\u2019t actually there to work, but to enjoy ourselves.\n\nSome folks were pulling pranks. Two guys went skinny dipping. One of our producers found a mossy spot near a rock and took a nap. And Kim, the faithful calisthenics person? She was making out with one of our social media managers. By the time I walked away, they\u2019d gone to second base.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut I paid most attention to Jay. There was something about him that didn\u2019t seem right. He was pulling off these slices of bark from a tree and rolling it into a pointy end. He poked his finger with it over and over, as if to see if he could feel it. I don\u2019t think he did. He was smiling too much.\n\nIt was hard to concentrate. I was constantly shaking my head, trying to focus. I must\u2019ve looked like I was having a seizure, but I doubt anyone was paying attention. They were busy dipping into their own kind of nonsense.\n\nAs the sun set on Costa Rosa, I fell asleep in the moss. It was the warmest, kindest sleep I\u2019d ever felt. Perfect temperature. Perfect softness. Who the hell needed a hotel anyway?\n\n\u00a0\n\nBy morning, the fog rolled back in. I could barely see my own hands. For a moment I couldn\u2019t remember where I was, or how I got there. It took me a moment to mentally retrace my steps. The flight. The boat. It was all a blur. All that mattered was that I\u2019d made it to Costa Rosa. Everything else was secondary.\n\nIt looked like everything had been covered in a soft cloud. I could see a couple of silhouettes in the distance, but I couldn\u2019t tell who was who. I sat there, taking in the atmosphere, eating a fresh fruit for breakfast \u2013 though I couldn\u2019t remember where I got it from.\n\nWhen the morning fog finally cleared, there weren\u2019t many of us left. Some had wandered off; others had made their way back down the road. There were also these hiking trails that I suspect some had followed. Both Kim and Jay were gone, and no one seemed to have a plan. We were all distracted \u2013 me included.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs I walked around, feeling the gentle moss between my toes, I tried to think of what I\u2019d packed. A pair of socks. A shirt. Anything. I could vaguely imagine the suitcase, but I couldn\u2019t make heads or tails of what I\u2019d packed. I remembered getting into a taxi \u2013 or maybe an uber \u2013 but then there was this blank space. There was a check-in somewhere. A ticket, maybe.\n\nI tried to think of my fianc\u00e9e. We were still together, officially, but there was something we\u2019d talked about that was nagging me. Not our fights, but something trivial. It really bothered me, like an itch in the back of my mind.\n\nIt took me a while to realize I\u2019d wandered around in a daze. I had no idea where I was anymore. There was no path. The others were gone. And yet \u2013 everything was pleasant.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt must\u2019ve been around noon when I finally saw some other people in the distance; a small group gathered around a clearing. My first instinct was to wave at them, but my chest tightened. There was something off about them. Giving it that second of hesitation, I noticed a couple of things.\n\nAll three of them were fully undressed, and they were strangers to me. There were two young men and an older woman. One of the men was carrying something in his right hand, and they were all looking down at the ground. I kept my head low and listened from a distance.\n\n\u201cIt feels so real,\u201d the man holding something said. \u201cLike I\u2019m really here.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d said the older woman. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d\n\nThey shared some fruit and had a laugh. I was just about to get up when I saw the man holding something turn to another angle. He was holding a gun. He pointed it at something on the ground and fired three rounds. The others cheered.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to do that,\u201d he smiled. \u201cI *love* this.\u201d\n\nThey turned their attention northward, away from me. They must\u2019ve heard something. Chuckling to themselves, they walked away, leaving me to sneak ahead to see what they\u2019d done. The soothing tropical silence cast a stark contrast to the sudden gunshot.\n\nI almost choked on my own spit when I saw her, face down in the undergrowth.\n\nKim. Shot dead at close range.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMore people had arrived at Costa Rosa that morning. It\u2019s like everyone had been invited and arrived at the same time. They all said the same thing; this was a dream. Too good to be true. They couldn\u2019t believe that there really was a Costa Rosa, and that they were there to enjoy it. No, for them, this was too unbelievable.\n\nI stayed close to a road, listening and watching \u2013 hoping to see someone I recognized. But it was getting harder to concentrate. The more I thought about it, the more it made sense. It *had* to be a dream. I barely felt my fingers when I pinched myself. And yet, for some reason, I knew I shouldn\u2019t give in, even though it was easy to do.\n\nI heard gunshots throughout the day. There was smoke in the distance. And by dinner time, when I went to the beach, I saw two women playing in the ocean \u2013 trying to drown one another. They laughed and cheered as they fought, scratched, and strangled one another. They could barely feel a thing. It was just a funny game.\n\nBut one of them dipped below the surface, and the bubbles stopped. And yet \u2013 the other kept laughing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe more people I met, the more nightmarish they seemed. Some of them brought things to the island, like the man with the gun. One brought chains. One brought barbed wire. There was this one guy walking up and down a hiking trail with some kind of Star Trek sword. Others seemed friendly enough, casually chatting with people they recognized. But sometimes they\u2019d just act out and attack, seemingly at random.\n\nIn the afternoon, I heard someone yell. They\u2019d spotted one of our talents. I think it was the baker. All of a sudden people were rushing to find them, cheering as they bound and leapt through the sands.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to meet her,\u201d someone said. \u201cShe has such a lovely voice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t fucking stand her,\u201d another muttered. \u201cSelf-centered *bitch*.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s like they were thinking out loud. It wasn\u2019t a conversation; just a constant verbal stream of thought.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI followed them for a while. A few of them saw me, I think, but they didn\u2019t care. I wasn\u2019t the famous face they were looking for - I looked like anyone. \u00a0I didn\u2019t want to think of what they might do if I tried to intervene. I was outnumbered. But as I watched from afar, I didn\u2019t pay enough attention to my immediate surroundings, where a familiar face crept closer.\n\nI didn\u2019t notice Jay until he was right next to me.\n\nI barely recognized him. He\u2019d fashioned a shiv from a broken camera stand, and he was half-covered in dry blood. And yet, he was calm as can be. Slow blinking like a warm cat resting on the porch. He reached for me, and my instinct was to pull back \u2013 but he could have that shiv in my neck in an instant. I froze.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe slowly ran a bloody hand across my cheek. That was it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to do that,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou look so soft.\u201d\n\nHe nuzzled his nose against my ear and sighed \u2013 then he stepped away.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re so nice,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cI like you.\u201d\n\nAnd that was it. He wandered off, having let his intrusive thoughts win. Maybe I was lucky not to be running through his mind any more than that. Maybe, to him, I just looked soft. Maybe that was all there was to it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOthers weren\u2019t so lucky.\n\nThey got hold of the baker and dragged her out of the woods. \u00a0There was cheering, and a scream. They\u2019d tied her to a pole and dragged her through the pink sands like a prize pig.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not real!\u201d she cried. \u201cIt was never real! We made it up! We made it the fuck up!\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t bear to look. Someone had a knife, and another had a spear. Others were recording with their phones. The screaming grew shrill and panicked before it stopped. They left her roasting on the fire \u2013 everyone wanted a part. Some of them were adoring fans. Others just wanted to see a woman burn.\n\nThey sent out search parties to look for the others. Most tourists had stopped caring, instead resorting to rolling and mewling on the beach like animals in heat.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI must\u2019ve sat there for hours before somebody noticed me. A middle-aged man with wild hair and dark eyes. I couldn\u2019t see what he was chewing on, but it smelled like meat.\n\n\u201cCome sit by the fire,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d\n\nI wanted to say no. To run. But I had to keep a low profile, or I\u2019d be next. If I just pretended, I could at least get some time to figure out a plan. So despite my instincts screaming at me to flee, I swallowed my fear.\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d\n\nHe smiled at that, not giving it a second thought.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey made a second fire in the sand. They danced and sang. Some of them had brought bottles, presumably with some kind of vodka. It was a torrential mess of impulses on display, everything from violence to carnality. I sat by the fire, hoping I had disappeared deep enough into the background for no one to notice. It seemed to work.\n\nI sat there, staring into the flames \u2013 where a crackling cranium stared back.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI didn\u2019t sleep that night. I stayed up long enough for the bone cinders to turn ashen, and for the morning fog to roll in. It was like watching the island getting wrapped in a blanket. But there was something more to it, now that I paid attention.\n\nThere were people walking in and out of it. People coming and going. Some disappeared into the mist, while others appeared out of nowhere. There was no way boats or planes were coming and going that fast. I could only draw one conclusion; Costa Rosa was, in no uncertain terms, not real. This *couldn\u2019t* be real.\n\nI wanted to give up. The others seemed to have it so easy. They just accepted it for what it was. Love, hate, violence \u2013 they could do it all, and not feel a thing. But I was too close to it. I knew Costa Rosa for what it was, and no matter how many times I wandered into that morning fog, it wouldn\u2019t let me leave.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat morning, I figured it out. The thing that\u2019d been bothering me.\n\nThe passports.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e and I hadn\u2019t renewed our passports. It would have been impossible for me to travel abroad. Somehow, I must\u2019ve known all along. Maybe that\u2019s why I wasn\u2019t as affected as the others \u2013 I had this gnawing reminder that I couldn\u2019t get out of my head.\n\nBut now that I\u2019d realized it, did that mean I was as susceptible as the rest of them?\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere were a lot of new faces there. Others came and went. Some were happy just laying on the beach, soaking up the sun. Others were hung from trees and skinned. It was an absurd mix of impressions. Two people walking hand in hand on the beach, discussing their favorite TV show. And by the treeline, a man making a dagger from a broken rib.\n\nI didn\u2019t get out of it unscathed either. There was this one woman who obsessed over my hair and tore out a fistful of it. One young man just went up to me and started kicking, again and again, until he got bored. I had rocks thrown at me. Not with the intent of hurting me, but as to settle some kind of bet. A contest, perhaps.\n\nBut it was just starting. Every hour, something was escalating. Devolving.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBy nightfall, the luminescent waters ran red. People were tied to burning palm trees, leaving sizzling corpses behind. Some were howling at the sky and killing each other with sharpened flint, bone, and rock. They painted each other with ash and blood. Screaming and laughter intermingled, and I couldn\u2019t tell them apart. To them, it was all just a dream, and nothing mattered.\n\nI found a hole and covered myself with palm fronds, hoping to wait out the night. I didn\u2019t want to take any chances. People were getting attacked left and right, and there was no telling what they might do if they noticed me.\n\nThey were barely speaking anymore. Some were just screaming or barking at one another. A couple of coherent voices were screeching nonsense about a broken God and a rotting tree plucking the moon from the sky.\n\nThen, a noise.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMy cellphone. I forgot I even had it. I thought the battery had run out long ago, but apparently, it hadn\u2019t. The service was showing zero bars, but I got a text message. I pulled it up, reading it inches from my face. It was from my fianc\u00e9e.\n\n\u201cI know we need space, but I miss you.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s all there was. I tried to respond, but couldn\u2019t. No bars. I held the phone close to my chest, feeling my pulse tap against my hands. People were running back and forth, just a couple of feet from my hiding space. They were taking down trees. Making rope. Cutting down the island, each other, and themselves. It was all just firewood to them.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThen someone looked down. I could see a white eye through a space in the fronds.\n\nIt was a young man, no older than 20. Half his head was shaved, with a deep cut going through his eyebrow. He kept getting blood in his left eye, making him spastically blink.\n\n\u201cLittle mole lady in her hidey-hole,\u201d he said. \u201cIs that as deep as you go?\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t say anything. I looked up at him, hoping he\u2019d get bored if I didn\u2019t provoke him. But it did nothing. He just straightened his back and picked something up. Something long and sharp.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get you out of there, mole lady.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nA makeshift spear made from a plastic rod. The first stab struck my left bicep, poking into a nerve. The second strike hit inches from my ear, making a couple of strands of hair stick to the mud. The third strike dug into the edge of my shoulder, cutting a surface wound. It was all so fast that I didn\u2019t get to think. Before I could begin to kick and scream, something happened.\n\nThe young man, like so many others, was attacked. A quick strike to the neck. He clutched his throat and collapsed into my hiding spot, warm blood pooling over my torso. Desperate fingers clawed at me, silently begging for help. His attacker walked up to get a better look.\n\nTurns out, it was Jay.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe looked at me and his victim. It\u2019s like it didn\u2019t even register with him. Jay had seen and done so much that this was like having breakfast \u2013 it was barely a conscious action. He leaned in a little to get a better look, and smiled. He must\u2019ve recognized me. As always, he wandered off.\n\nI lay there with a dying man on my chest, and waited for it all to be over. I just had to make it through the night. I clutched my phone until my fingers clamped shut, and closed my eyes. No sleep came to me, and a kaleidoscope of screams and cheers filled my mind with unspeakable images.\n\nBut through it all, I waited. People rushing by didn\u2019t really take notice. All they saw was a dead man, resting on a bed of palm fronds.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBy morning, I had a plan. People who bought into the fantasy of Costa Rosa seemed to come and go as they pleased. Every time that morning fog rolled in, something happened. So I was gonna give it one final push. A real, honest, attempt.\n\nI wandered down to the beach. The pain from my cuts and bruises was dull, but ever-present. A soft breeze touched my exposed hair. Then I took out my phone, turned it to selfie mode, and pressed record. And despite there being no bars \u2013 the video went live.\n\n\u201c*Hey!*\u201d I said, mustering every bit of cheer I could. \u201cThanks for dropping in! Here I am, living the *good life* at Costa Rosa! Just\u2026 look at this beach! Why\u2019d you ever want to go home, right?\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t know whether anyone was watching. Maybe there was no one on the other end. But that camera felt like an eye, looking straight through me.\n\n\u201cRight?\u201d I repeated.\n\nI held my smile for as long as I could. The video feed got cut, and the battery died.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThen, a gunshot.\n\nA young man by the treeline, at the edge of the morning fog. Same one who\u2019d taken down Kim.\n\n\u201cFucking *vultures*.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI didn\u2019t even notice going down on one knee. I couldn\u2019t get back up. Clutching my stomach I kicked and crawled away from the beach, and into the ocean. Only then did I realize I\u2019d been shot in the stomach. The salt stung my wound.\n\nCosta Rosa was perfect. It was beautiful. It was everything we needed it to be, and it would take me home. I just had to believe in it. I\u2019d shown loyalty, and it would reward me.\n\nIt had to. Dear God, it had to.\n\nI took one final breath as my head dipped beneath the surface.\n\nFog.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn the distance between Costa Rosa and wherever we may be, there is a glimpse of something inhuman. Something that listens to what we want, and makes it happen. Like we wished upon stars as kids, we wish upon likes and favorites as adults \u2013 praying they\u2019ll grant us our desperate wants. Money. Love. Fame. The same wishes, but different stars.\n\nThey only gave us what we asked for. There was no malice. Just an island in the sun.\n\nSalt water slipped into my ears. I could hear my heart slowing. A pressure built in my head as I sank. A fog draping over my eyes. I reached out.\n\nHoping.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe fog parted. I was crawling. The sand had turned to concrete. A pleasant breeze turned to sudden cold. It was desolate, and familiar. I\u2019d walked up that driveway a thousand times. I was home.\n\nI called out to my fianc\u00e9e \u2013 and he heard me. And through the gunshot, the stab wounds, and the bruises; a single soothing balm remained. I managed to say my thought out loud.\n\n\u201cI got your message.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI\u2019d been gone for days. I\u2019d just walked out of the house and disappeared. No one had seen or heard it. I\u2019d just been gone. They\u2019d been looking for me.\n\nI tried keeping up with the others from the hospital. Most were dead. The baker had burned to death in her bed. Kim had been shot. Others fell asleep behind the wheel and destroyed themselves. But it didn\u2019t read as mysterious deaths, brought on by mysterious circumstance. It was all just the way these things happen. People die in fires and cars every day.\n\nI didn\u2019t have an answer when they asked who shot me. I told them someone came out of the fog. It was a half-truth, at least.\n\nJay, on the other hand, was still missing. If I were to guess, he\u2019s still on Costa Rosa \u2013 living his best life.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat video of me on the beach of Costa Rosa is still out there. It\u2019s real. You can see the fog, and the pink sand. I\u2019ve seen some bot networks copy and paste parts of it in some kind of AI-generated compilation crap. But the hashtag is gone. The promos too. I think our sponsors scraped the SEO clean from the web.\n\nI\u2019ve gone back to get a master\u2019s degree since then. If this has taught me anything, it is that I\u2019m a good listener, and I should do something with that. But you won\u2019t see me in the comments anytime soon.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten married. My wounds have healed, but it still stings whenever I see someone mention those I used to work with. I see their faces in thumbnails sometimes, adorning things like \u201cTop 50 Social Media Celebrity Deaths\u201d and other morbid crap.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI think those pink beaches are still out there, somewhere. And the bioluminescent waterfall. But honestly, I\u2019ve started to forget what it felt like. Maybe that\u2019s the price you pay when you turn your back on Costa Rosa \u2013 you start to forget. That\u2019s partly why I wanted to write it down.\n\nBut I suppose if there\u2019s anything I\u2019ve learned, and will remember forever, it\u2019s this.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the business of lies, you can\u2019t expect good things to come true."},"21":{"title":"I attend a private university. There are terrible consequences if you fail.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kjloul\/i_attend_a_private_university_there_are_terrible\/","flair":null,"author":"Jay_Tee13","selftext":"It\u2019s usually the dense odor of sweat staining the library that lets me know how hard I need to study. Obviously, I study no matter what. But some of the tests are easier than others.\n\nI let my eyes wander the frantic array of folders, notebooks, and leaking pens. You stay this late you get to see the caffeine graveyards littering some desks, threatening to spill their cardboard and aluminum dead onto the floor. Or sometimes, like tonight, there\u2019s a pair in the corner embracing, sobbing silently into each other\u2019s shoulders.\n\nAt a certain point a break was in order. I snaked through the crowded tables and made my way down to the first floor where I could step outside.\n\nThese vapes are shit for you; I find myself sneaking off to the bathroom too often. Cigarettes make you work for it.\n\nI unwrapped a fresh pack and smacked one end against my hand. As I brought the lighter to my lips, hungry for that first noxious hit to soothe my lungs, the door behind me swung open. The cigarette tumbled from my mouth with the force of someone running head-first into me. A blond kid, young, and on all fours now spraying puke from his mouth in a violent torrent. The grass was soaked when he finally wiped the froth from his lips.\n\n\u201cYou owe me a cigarette.\"\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he gasped.\n\nI looped an arm under his shoulder and pulled him up. \u201cKidding. You alright?\u201d\n\nHis legs were shaking so I set him against the wall and lit another dart while he caught his breath. Once the head rush set in I offered it to him.\n\nHe shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t smoke.\u201d\n\n\u201cMight as well.\u201d\n\nHe looked at the outstretched arm and accepted after a few more breaths.\n\n\u201cMax,\u201d he choked out, smoke shooting from his nose like a medieval dragon. After another hit his shoulders relaxed. He sank against the wall cradling his knees to his chest.\n\n\u201cI wanted to go to Harvard.\u201d\n\nI took the cigarette back. Didn\u2019t we all. Too bad though. The world preys on ignorance. When you\u2019re valedictorian you won\u2019t settle for anything less than the best. And if your family knew the right people, that\u2019s what they offered.\n\n\u201cHow old are you,\u201d I asked, focusing on the orange ember.\n\n\u201cFreshman. Turned 19 last month.\u201d\n\nI smiled.\n\n\u201cSenior. Graduating if this exam goes well. I used to say the same thing. Probably, with a little more vomit involved.\u201d I procured another cigarette from my pack. \u201cTell you the truth though. It's not gonna change. You just learn to aim for the toilet.\u201d\n\nMax accepted the second cigarette with no hassle.\n\n\u201cHow do you feel now?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter, I think,\u201d whispered Max.\n\n\u201cYea? Well, now I\u2019m fucking stressed.\u201d The wind picked up and we shivered under the brick awning. \u201cDo me a favor and just relax. Everything is going to be fine.\u201d\n\nWe finished the nicotine in silence. Before we headed back in, Max and I exchanged numbers. He asked me if we could study together.\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI prefer to study alone. Good luck.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe morning of the exam I found myself in the small bathroom of my dorm painting the porcelain with last night\u2019s half-digested dinner. Sleep had progressively deteriorated throughout the week.\n\nNot just me though. The last few nights I\u2019d stumble over the bodies of snoozing students. Couldn't make it home from the library, so they curled up right there on the corner of the street. I\u2019d never seen that before.\n\nThe air around campus was soaked with dread. Max had texted me the night before for some last-minute cramming. We got some studying done, but it was mostly me listening to him rant about the university.\n\nHe moaned about how if he\u2019d known the reality of this place he\u2019d never have gone here. I nodded, but I wanted to say, \u2018no shit.\u2019\n\nHis parents had told him with his test scores he could get into the most prestigious university in the world. So elite that its existence was unknown to the 99.9% of the population destined for mediocrity. Visions of a world class life broke the camel\u2019s back and now he was here.\n\nCan't judge.\n\nFreshman year, after a few international flights and a long bus ride, a small city sprouted from miles of desert. The Educators told us we\u2019d be living there for the next 4 years; no breaks, no holidays, no visits to or from parents. No electronics, only pencil and paper. And classes would begin immediately.\n\nA population of students, somewhere in the range of 300-500 were housed throughout the campus, but that number always changes. Everyone takes the same curriculum with staggered class times. No homework, no extra credit; just two exams every year. No leeway for those who failed.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t made any friends here yet. Too busy with\u2026\u201d Max made a defeated gesture towards his notebook. He was skinny, but I could see hints of an athlete in the tone of his arms.\n\nThe clock was reading late. I started to pack my things. \u201cIf we pass tomorrow, dinner\u2019s on me. You pick where.\u201d\n\nMax laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll run you up a motherfucker of a bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d I said. \u201cNothing else to spend it on here.\u201d\n\nNow, morning of, the thoughts of dinner were bleached from my mind. I slammed a coffee, pitting it against the 3 hours of sleep I had milked. I made for the exam building, flipping through my notebook while I walked. A line was already forming outside when I arrived.\n\nMax was sitting right on the sidewalk, legs crossed, head buried in his notebook. He noticed me as the doors opened.\n\n\u201cWe got this, right?\u201d Max said. \u201cWe got this.\u201d\n\nStudents filed into the exam room, a large auditorium with a stage at the front. Max and I sat together near the back. A few more trickled in until the doors finally shut five minutes past the hour. Educators took their posts, one at each exit.\n\nEveryone was settled when there was a frantic banging.\n\n\u201c*Please*,\u201d a muffled voice begged. \u201c*The bus broke down. Let me in, there\u2019s still time!*\u201d\n\nBut everyone knew the consequences of being late and the room remained still.\n\nAn Educator took to the stage holding a microphone. He was grinning like he heard a dirty joke he wished to share with everyone.\n\n\u201cCongratulations. You\u2019ve arrived at your final exam of the year.\u201d His cadence was choppy. He spoke like he was tasting each word, rolling it over with his tongue before it came out. \u201cWe hope you all studied hard. As some upperclassmen may have noticed, this semester\u2019s curriculum has diverged slightly from previous years.\u201d\n\nScattered pockets of buzzing voices sprouted around the room. Typically, it had been numerous textbooks with an arsenal of subjects to study from. Not the standard topics you would expect; dead languages like Sanskrit and Aramaic, the physics behind a blackhole, origins and evolutionary paths of reptiles, cancer in the context of biological warfare. This term each class taught the same subject. They had only provided one textbook for us: *Dark Psychology*\n\n\u201cThe north wind created the Vikings,\u201d said the Educator. \u201cAdaptability under unknown and extreme circumstances. This is the trait most valuable to the futures waiting for you.\u201d\n\nThe Educator on stage was almost giddy, shifting his weight from foot to foot. An unseen weight was beginning to fill the room. Max kept looking over, hoping his gaze would elicit some form of offered comfort from me. I had none to give.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll begin our exam now. There is no need for pens or pencils. You may stand, walk around, and as always you may not leave the room. But first, please check beneath your seat for your test materials.\u201d\n\nConfused looks and the soft rumble of movement began to crescendo. Max shrugged after he had gone down and come up empty handed. I leaned forward and reached beneath my seat. I flailed my arm around until it brushed over something, chilly and dense. I tightened my grip and with a nauseating certainty pulled the object into view.\n\nA black 9 mm napped in my hand. It was a gun I was familiar with from previous curriculum.\n\nClambering atop the gasps and frantic speak of the room, the Educator\u2019s voice peaked. \u201cUnder every few seats we\u2019ve placed a decision-maker. Those who possess one, look to your neighbors. Yes, yes, left then right. Study their faces, hear their arguments. Then make your decision.\u201d\n\nI was still looking at the gun. My sleeve was tugged from the right and I met the face of a guy about my age. He had a flat nose and oval chocolate eyes that bore into me, gauging. They flicked to the gun before he extended his hand.\n\n\u201cJacob,\u201d he said, squeezing firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s my last year here. Last test actually. I\u2019m looking forward to going home, seeing my family.\u201d\n\nI nodded.\n\n\u201cMax!\u201d said a voice from my left. I turned.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Max, I-I\u2019m a freshman and it was my birthday recently. I\u2026 I want to live.\u201d\n\nThe nausea was beginning to crawl its way up my throat. A small black spot in the corner of my vision was starting to grow, threatening to take over. I needed to control my breathing.\n\nEveryone was out of their seats now, dispersed about the auditorium in tight groups. There was damp conversation with intensity that splintered against the walls. I stood and climbed over the rows of seats until I was at the back of the room.\n\nJacob reached me first. He grabbed my arm and pulled me in close.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to\u2013\u201d\n\nA sharp clatter made us jump. A petite girl in a group of two guys next to us had dropped her gun. She was a leaf in a hurricane, trembling so fierce she couldn\u2019t move to retrieve the weapon. One of the guys next to her squatted, picked it up, and with no show of hesitation fired point-blank into the other boys face. A dime sized splotch of red appeared just to the right of his nose and he accelerated to the floor like gravity had doubled in strength. A healthy flow of blood hosed from the chunk of flesh blown out the back of his head.\n\nThe petite girl shrieked and passed out, imitating the lifeless body next to her. Max, almost finished scaling the rows of seats, flinched and toppled over. The boy with the gun turned to an Educator posted at a nearby exit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s over, right?\u201d\n\nThe Educator nodded and stepped aside. The boy dropped his gun. For a moment he regarded the body on the floor. He shuddered and hurried through the exit.\n\nJacob then grabbed me by my shoulders.\n\n\u201cGive it to me,\u201d he demanded. \u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything, I\u2019ll do it for you.\u201d He extended his open hand, waiting for it to be filled with the cold metal that would guarantee his life.\n\nI watched while the Educators cleaned the scene. The petite girl was carried out, and the body of the boy swiftly covered and disposed of while the floor was scrubbed.\n\n\u201cOur first decision has been made,\u201d the Educator from the stage announced.\n\nAnother stinging crack went off, accompanied by a cry.\n\n\u201cAnd the second.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, I was on the floor. My vision was smeared and the back of my head pulsed. An ache traced its way from the bottom of my jaw, escaping through my teeth. I turned over and saw Jacob scrabbling for the pistol that had disappeared from my hands.\n\nI was able to get to my knees when Jacob stood over me. He right hand was twitching, one of the knuckles torn from where it had contacted my chin. He pointed the gun between my eyes.\n\n\"Please,\" I coughed. The black hole of the barrel injected me with fear and I began to shake.\n\nMax slammed into him like a pick-up truck. He bounced off the floor, dazed and immediately scrambling to find where the gun had gone but Max was quickly on top of him. He pressed his forearm into Jacob\u2019s cheek, pinning his head to the ground with his entire weight.\n\nThe 9 mm lay only a few feet from the scuffle and Max fumbled for it with his free hand. Jacob bucked his hips, sending him flying to land on his face. Again, the gun found itself in Jacob\u2019s hands and he pointed it at Max. He huddled into a ball, covered his ears and shrieked.\n\n\"Oh ho. Look at this,\" chuckled the Educator on stage. \"So much for all that studying.\"\n\nThe gun clicked when he pulled the trigger. Jacob flexed his fingers. Nothing. He brought the pistol to his face and hurried to fix the jam. By then I was able to deliver my own punch.\n\nMy form was flimsy and I felt my wrist pop when my arm followed through. I must\u2019ve hit a sweet spot because he stiffened up and fell back on his ass. He looked at me confused, like he was hoping I could explain something to him before Max jumped with an arm raised overhead.\n\nWhen he landed on Jacob he brought the butt of the gun down in a devastating blow that split his forehead into a wicked crimson smile. The confused look turned into a blank one. Another wet crunch and his arms jerked into the fencing response. An artistic splatter of blood painted Max\u2019s face as he raised his arm over and over and over again until Jacob\u2019s head was an uneven mountain range of peaks and valleys.\n\nMy pulse in my ears had subsided allowing me to hear again. The groups nearest us had paused their deliberations to watch in horror.\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d The words dripped from Max. \u201cWhat the fuck. What the fuck.\u201d\n\n\"Bravo!\" the microphone whined.\n\nI pulled his shaking form from the red mess beneath him. The pain in my wrist was distant. I led him past the Educator, through the exit and out into the cool afternoon while his hands covered his face.\n\nWe sat in a field for some time. We monitored the clouds in silence, feeling the tickle of grass against the back of our necks. The air tasted like dandelion. Every so often the sounds of fireworks would find us from beyond the hill, though it was never enough to shake us. The world is beautiful. We are not.\n\nDinner that night was delicious. Max hadn\u2019t lied. He finished three entrees before asking for the dessert menu.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s on him,\u201d Max said when the waiter asked if the check needed splitting. I smiled and nodded.\n\nWe walked home that night, bellies full and minds empty. In front of Max\u2019s dorm we shook hands, hugged, and promised to keep in touch. I wished him the best and good luck. A bus was meeting the graduates tomorrow to take us to an airport, and then home.\n\nAnd after that, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sure my post-academia bliss will not last long. The future waiting for me is impatient. Eventually someone or something will call upon me and my \u2018talents\u2019. The Educators said our careers are already written for us. So, all that\u2019s left to do is wait."},"22":{"title":"I found a Polaroid camera buried behind my new house \u2014 and every photo shows a life that isn\u2019t mine","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kjwakt\/i_found_a_polaroid_camera_buried_behind_my_new\/","flair":"Series","author":"OriginsOfEvil666","selftext":"I found a Polaroid camera buried in the woods behind my new house \u2014 and every photo I take shows something that isn\u2019t there\n\nI moved out here to get away. Not from anything dramatic \u2014 just noise, people, all the mess of life. I bought a small fixer-upper in rural Maine, with creaky floorboards and a backyard that bleeds into a dense, old forest. It was perfect. Or I thought it was.\n\nLast week, while clearing out some brush near the edge of the woods, my shovel hit something hard. At first I thought it was a rock, but it had corners. Sharp, precise corners. I dug around it and pulled out a rusted metal box, sealed shut with what looked like a leather strap long rotted to threads. Inside was a Polaroid camera \u2014 old, but in surprisingly good shape. There was also a single undeveloped photo, still blank, and a pack of film cartridges tucked beside it.\n\nWeird, sure, but kind of cool. I brought it inside, cleaned it up, loaded a fresh cartridge. I took a photo of my kitchen as a test.\n\nWhen the image developed, it showed the kitchen, yeah \u2014 but not my kitchen. The layout was the same, but it was pristine. Renovated. The counters were granite, not the beat-up laminate I had. The wallpaper was gone. And there was someone standing at the sink. A woman. Head turned slightly, hair tied back. I live alone.\n\nI tried to brush it off \u2014 maybe it was a prank, a preloaded shot, I don\u2019t know. But the film developed fresh. And I was too curious not to try again.\n\nI took another photo, this time of my living room. When it developed, the furniture was different. Nicer. Cleaner. A man sat in my armchair, reading a book. The light was wrong \u2014 soft and yellow, like it was evening, even though I\u2019d taken the photo in broad daylight.\n\nEach picture showed a different version of my home. Better, warmer, lived-in. And always with people I\u2019ve never seen before. A couple eating dinner. A little boy asleep on the couch with a dog curled at his feet. A teenage girl staring directly at the camera with a blank expression.\n\nI started taking photos of the woods outside. One showed an old swing set where there\u2019s now just rotted stumps. Another showed what looked like a small cabin, just beyond the treeline. I walked out there, tried to find it \u2014 nothing. Just trees and silence.\n\nThen last night, I took one more picture before bed \u2014 my bedroom, lights off, flash on.\n\nThe photo developed slowly. When it cleared, I saw myself, asleep in bed. But I wasn\u2019t alone. Something stood in the corner. Tall. Thin. Barely visible in the shadows. Watching.\n\nI haven\u2019t taken another photo since. But the blank one \u2014 the very first, undeveloped photo I found in the box \u2014 it\u2019s not blank anymore.\n\nIt shows me, standing in the woods, holding the camera.

We just live with them and hope they don\u2019t harm the ones we love.\n\nMy name is Violet and I\u2019m the only person who\u2019s ever seen them\u2026and returned home to talk about it. \n\nIt was just last month. Mom and Dad had sent me to bed. Vanished into their room to binge TV. It\u2019d been an intense night of arguing.\n\nWe\u2019d fought like that, nonstop, ever since my brother, Jaime, died in the car accident. It was the heartache, splitting us apart. Making us miserable.\n\nWell\u2026I found a way to solve all of it. \n\nAs soon as my parents were asleep, I cracked open my window. Grabbed my backpack. And climbed down to my bicycle below.\n\nIt took about two hours before I finally reached the bridge. The place was eerie, surrounded by darkness except for those three street lamps.\n\nI dismounted my bike, leaned it against the railing, and waited.\n\nAbout five minutes passed and I heard rustling. A slight breeze brushed my hair as\u2026\n\n\u2026a pale figure, six feet tall, descended onto the railing, bound in a black leather trench coat, ears pointed like an elf\u2019s. \n\nThis was Pointy Ears. \n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come here, Warm Blood,\u201d he said, stepping down from the railing. \n\nI unslung my backpack. Pulled out a clove of garlic.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t come all this way to talk to a lackey,\u201d I said. \u201cWhere\u2019s your leader?\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPointy Ears slunk back. The garlic\u2019s strong scent frightened him. He knew I was serious. \n\nThen, another cold breeze swept past us. \n\nTwo other forms, wearing the same garments as the first, appeared before me.\n\nOne was gaunt and looked like a creature who hadn\u2019t fed in centuries. The other was a woman, or used to be, with flowing hair and deep rose-colored eyes. \n\nThis was Rose Eyes. She was the one I was after, the leader of the vampires.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou must have a death-wish, Warm Blood,\u201d she hissed, with a voice both beautiful and dark. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo make a deal.\u201d\n\nShe leapt to the ground. The other two crept close on either side, hemming me in. \n\n\u201cThe dead do not make deals with the living.\u201d\n\nI held out the garlic. Fear knotting my stomach. For the first time, I felt uncertain: \u2018What was I doing here?!\u2019\n\nWith the speed of a cobra, Rose Eyes snatched the garlic from my fist. Crushed it in her palm. Licked the juice from her fingers. \n\nPointy Ears laughed as I gawked in disbelief. This wasn\u2019t supposed to be happening. Vampires were afraid of garlic, right?!\n\n\u201cHow did you\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour history books don\u2019t mention my kind,\u201d Rose Eyes hissed. \u201cIf they did, you\u2019d know the standard deterrents don\u2019t work.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d \n\nShe just smiled. \n\nMy mind drifted back to my house. I envisioned my parents waiting for me on the porch. Begging me to come home. Praying for a second chance for us to be happy.\n\nI reached into my bag. Grabbed my crucifix.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d Rose Eyes said, waved her hand.\n\nI went still. The crucifix and backpack fell. Trinkets scattered: a bottle of blessed water\u2026a wooden stake. \n\nPointy Ears and Gaunt One leapt back, startled by the items. But Rose Eyes perused each one, curious, then shoved me back toward the railing. Her face inches from mine. \n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d \n\n\u201c\u2026to be like you.\u201d \n\nShe tilted her head, curious. \n\n\u201cMy parents hate me. All we do is fight. My brother\u2019s\u2026gone. No one at school likes me and there\u2019s no reason for me to live so\u2026\u201d I exhaled, feeling the weight lift off my shoulders.\n\u201cI want to be dead. Like you.\u201d\n\nRose Eyes turned to Gaunt One. He just licked his lips, said: \u201cGive her what she desires.\u201d\n\nRose Eyes slammed me against a street lamp. Tore open my jacket, exposed my throat. Bared her fangs.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d I shouted. Peering up at her. \u201cDoes it\u2026hurt?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course it does.\u201d \n\nHer teeth sank into me. Ripping into my flesh. It was agonizing. My knees buckled as I gasped. Held in her impossible grip. \n\nI wanted to scream. But a hand pressed against my mouth. It was Pointy Ears, silencing me.\n\nI was so scared. Fear flooded my face as I stared into Rose Eyes\u2019 merciless gaze.\n\nAnd yet\u2026I felt peace at the same time. I was so tired. I just wanted to sleep.\n\n\u2026just wanted to sleep\u2026\n\n***\n\nWhen I opened my eyes, I was in my bedroom. Still in the same clothes. Blankets piled on top of me. \n\nI remembered the night before. Sat up. Felt my neck, fingers searching for a scar. Found none. \n\nI held up my phone. Scanned every inch of my throat with the camera. No signs of any struggle. And there, under the bed, was my backpack filled with trinkets. \n\n\u201cDamn.\u201d I stared at the clock: Six AM. \n\nThe entire sequence had been a dream.\n\nI glanced to the window. The sun was rising. School, the place I hated most, would be starting soon. \n\nI hopped out of bed. Pulled the curtain aside. \n\n\u201cOuch!\u201d I stepped back. Pain shotgunning through my body. \n\nI looked down. There on my wrist was\u2026a small patch of burned skin. \n\nThe sunlight had hurt me!\n\nI closed the blinds. Breathing heavily, allowing the oxygen to fill my lungs. \n\nIt was the first time I noticed\u2026my eyes\u2026in the vanity mirror. \n\nThey were rose-pink. \n\nAnd my teeth\u2026\n\nI opened my jaws and they came out\u2026incisors sharp as a piranha\u2019s.\n\nRose Eyes had fulfilled my wish. \n\nShe had given me a new life. \n\nNot as a vampire\u2026but as something else.\n\nI couldn\u2019t wait to start my day.

Albeit, I wish I didn\u2019t. I wish I couldn\u2019t remember how the wind blew through the trees and the dripping of the rain as it left the gutter. I tried to forget, I\u2019ve tried relentlessly to short circuit my brain with black tar heroin and cocaine. I\u2019ve tried to entirely replace my bad blood with it more times than I\u2019d like to admit. \n\n\n\n\nWhen I was six, my dad lost his contracting job. The tears he shed, the sounds of his sobs as he talked about the fear of losing our home have been burned into my brain ever since. I still remember how hard my mom had worked to find a job, but due to the cost of living in our large city and her lack of education, she wasn\u2019t able to support us. The only job she managed to find was a job as a worker for a live stock farm in some small Kentucky town. \n\nAt around ten in the morning, our car pulled into a small dirt driveway. The house was actually rather nice, it was painted a light blue- although some areas had begun to chip- and the trims along the windows had been painted with just enough care to prevent dripping. I was the first to step out of the car, according to my mother I\u2019d always been the first to explore new places. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 certainly something.\u201d My father had said, opening up the door as he stepped out too. He had been in the passengers seat, as he was severely hung over from a night of excessive drinking. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not bad, honey.\u201d She\u2019d replied curtly, grabbing her luggage from the trunk as she stepped towards the door and pushed it open. My eyes had immediately scanned the inside as I ran in front of her, she nearly tripped over me as I did so.\n\n\n\nThe years passed with very little notable change, our town had remained uneventful for a very long time, the only things that had been remarkable were the few missing people that had popped up on occasion. My father remained an alcoholic and my mother remained a kind, yet subtly neglectful woman. I only had one close friend in my childhood and teen years, he was a boy my age. Unlike mine, his family had lived in the same town for generations, to the point most people knew who he was just off his last name. The Obsorn family was one of those families where no one was sure where they had gained their wealth, people just accepted that they had it. Also unlike me, Kayce Osborn was a complete social butterfly. During our freshman year of high school, he dragged me along to at least ten bonfires and house parties. I still remember the way his smile lit up his face when he looked at me, the little dimple that formed lopsidedly on the left half of his perfect face. \n\nMy \"normal teen life\" as I called it, had came to an abrupt end on my seventeenth birthday. \n\n\"Hey, Fin's mom,\" I heard Kayce's voice from my reclined position on the couch, \"is he home?\" I knew damn well that Kayce had known I was home, as I was always home. \n\n\"I'm here!\"\n\n\"Dude, you're like, hella old now.\" The sixteen year old said as he peeked his head in the door. \"Hella old and still jobless.\" It wasn't like I didn't want a job, I just didn't know where to work. I'd tried to work for the ranch once when I was fifteen, but I'd found it too strange- as there were very few cows and yet the town practically lived off the meat they sold. After that, I just stayed jobless. Kayce glanced over at my mom with a look that she knew too well, a silent way of asking her if we could hang out. \n\nWe spent that whole day driving and walking around the town and the surrounding scenic areas. At around eleven that night, Kayce sighed and stretched his arms as he popped his neck against the head rest. \n\n\"My parents have me on an eleven thirty curfew tonight.\"\n\n\"Damn. Why? Since when have you had a curfew?\"\n\n\"Man, hell if I know,\" Kayce had begun with a shrug, \"you should just sneak in my window or something so we can still hang after my curfew.\" I had snuck in his window so many times that it was practically my second nature. \n\n\"Okay, yeah. Let's do that. I don't feel like going home and enduring a drunken tirade on my birthday anyway.\" I said as I pulled out my phone to text my mom and let her know that I was going to stay over at Kayce's house. I started the car up again, driving in silence as Kayce stared out the widow. \n\nIt wasn't exactly hard to find his house, it was the only mansion in town after all. The walls rose higher than the trees outside, three stories of beautiful architecture that I practically shared with my best friend.\n\nOnce he got out, I drove down the road and parked, waiting for him to enter the house before I stepped out too. His room was on the second story, but due to the ladder that his mom had put up to grow ivy and flowers on, as she thought it looked pretty, I was able to get up. I pulled the window open with some effort, climbing in and shutting it behind me before I went to hide under the bed. \n\nI could hear them talking from downstairs, although I couldn't make out the words. I felt bad for even attempting to, as I knew he'd tell me what they were talking about when he came up, but I couldn't help it. I was nosy. After around thirty minutes, which I spent scrolling on my phone, I heard the door creek open. The steps were slow, I could hear heavy and ragged breathing. I pulled away from the edge of the bed, thinking it was Kayce's parents, and inched closer to the wall. The painfully bright light shone through a crack in the door, barely visible behind the figure. Whoever it was took a few more agonizingly slow steps forward, the door shutting as the light disappeared from the small opening. I covered my mouth with my hand, I was sure that if I breathed too loud, whoever it was would catch me. As I did, the bed creaked beneath the weight of the person who'd positioned themselves on it. \n\nI closed my eyes, taking a deep breath, when I opened them, I was faced with the top of Kayce's head. Slowly, his face was revealed. \n\nI stared into wide eyes and for a moment, I was sure someone had killed and replaced my best friend. I didn't recognize that look. \n\n\"Finny.\"\n\n\"Kayce?\"\n\n\"Go home. No. Don't go home. Run. You have to run, run and never, ever come back.\"\n\n\n\nI can't continue with my story, as much as I wish I could to just get it off my chest, just writing is making me feel sick to my stomach. Maybe I'll be able to tell the rest, maybe I'll die with the secrets of my little town. "},"25":{"title":"I found a deep-fake of myself on the dark web.

Prior to my flight, I had told them everything over the phone, which saved me the discomfort of a face-to-face explanation. The ride home was awkward and quiet, and my dad spent most of it consoling my distraught mother, like *she* was the one who needed emotional support.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI spent the next five days mostly in my room, too nervous to stray far from the house. I felt I might turn down any street corner and run into Angelica's creator. I returned to Tor, looking for any discussion of DOV3S that I might've overlooked. I revisited the *MirrorFrame* forum, and saw yet another post by the same user who had inquired about Angelica's identity.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"DOV3S down for good??!!\" asked the user, dismay palpable through the screen. There were three replies to this post, all of which confirmed that the website had disappeared without a trace. I figured they simply changed URLs, but if loyal customers could no longer track them down, then perhaps DOV3S really had ceased operations. I would've been ecstatic if I wasn't concerned it would impact my case.\n\n\n\nAfter a week with few updates from either the police or the FBI, I started to emerge from my room more frequently, trying to rebuild bridges between my parents and myself. My mom and dad weren't bad people exactly, just distant. There had been that whole pageantry thing in my early childhood, and then my failed attempt at modelling when I was a teen. Sometimes it felt like they viewed me more as a side-hustle than a daughter. At least they had calmed down considerably once I turned 15 or so. My dad came into some money thanks to sports-betting, and he was generous with his earnings. He put me through both private high school and all four years of college, and I knew he spoiled my mom rotten with vacations.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI remembered that my Dad had at one point been friends with Adam's stepdad, who I'll call \"Mr. Doe\". I broached the topic over dinner one night, and the inquiry made my dad stiffen.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"John's son? No, can't say I knew the boy all too well,\" he said. \"He seemed nice enough. A little awkward, maybe. One of those computer geeks.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Pot, meet kettle!\" My mom said with a laugh, oblivious to the shifting tone of the conversation. My mom and dad knew only that I'd found a deep fake of myself, and that a \"fan\" had broken into my apartment. I hadn't mentioned Adam and Mary's involvement, partly because I just didn't want to talk about it, and partly because I didn't want my mom telling the whole neighborhood.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"What about Mr. Doe himself? You guys were friends when I was in highschool, right?\"\n\n\n\n\"Hm? I suppose John and I golfed now and then.\"\n\n\n\nThis time, it was my mom's turn to stiffen. Her expression of displeasure departed from her face as quickly as it arrived, but I caught it nonetheless. Oddly, it seemed to be the mention of golfing, not Mr. Doe, that agitated her. I asked a few more questions, and then the three of us fell into an uneasy silence. After a solid minute of this, my dad slapped both his palms on the wooden dining table, startling both my mother and I. He looked up with a smile.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"You know what? It's been too long since the three of us did anything together. I say we need a vacation, Grace more than anyone. Don't you miss Ixtapa, love?\" he asked my mother, who all but squealed in affirmation.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Dad, I can't go to *Mexico*. Not with everything going on right now.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\nMy dad's smile tightened a little. \"Kiddo, everything going on right now is *why* you need to get outta here. I want you as far away from that man as possible, and the police up north are already working with you remotely\u2014they can call you with any updates. Besides, you're a victim, not a suspect. They're not going to restrict your travel.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\nI wasn't sure what to make of my dad's plan, but the thought of getting out of the neighborhood was a pleasant one. I reached out to the detective on my case about leaving the country short-term, and while he wasn't exactly pleased, he said I was free to move around as I wished.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI started packing. When I couldn't find the swimsuit that I wanted to bring, my mom suggested checking the storage bins in the attic, the entrance to which was in my parents' room. With some reluctance, I pulled down the folding ladder and ascended to the dingy, claustrophobic place, more like a crawl-space than a room. I didn't find my suit, but I did find many mementos from my childhood: toys, books, photo albums, schoolwork, and an absurd amount of home videos copied to DVD and VHS. My parents *had* always preferred to look at my life through a camera lens. I spent so long rifling through my old essays from high school that I forgot what I was looking for altogether. I returned to the attic several times after that, each new visit unlocking some previously-forgotten memory.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFor a few days after my dad's impromptu vacation suggestion, I was in limbo. There were no updates to my case and my endless queries about DOV3S yielded little new information. My only success was learning a few more facts about Mary through the abandoned Facebook profile of her mother, whom I'll call \"Mrs. Roe\". The profile, despite belonging to the mother, almost exclusively featured Mary. There seemed to be an endless stream of posts documenting Mary's childhood, everything from her 5th birthday party to her junior varsity soccer games.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI never found mention of a \"Mr. Roe\", either on social media or in the news, so I had a feeling Mary's father was out of the picture.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAs for Mrs. Roe, I could barely find a thing about the woman. She seemed to have disappeared off the face of the Earth after the search for Mary died down. It seemed unjust, in a way. How was it fair that her daughter was plastered all over the internet forever, whereas she had escaped its panoptic gaze unscathed?\u00a0\n\n\n\nOn April 2nd, 2025, I received a text from the detective up north. He asked if I was available for a video call, as opposed to our usual phone conversation, which immediately told me that they'd found something. I expected to hear that they'd discovered who had made the deep fakes, or at the very least, that they had found my stalker.\u00a0\n\n\n\nInstead, they told me that Adam was dead. His corpse had been found in a ravine in the hills near his home, not far from where he asked me to meet only a week prior. He was found by a hiker, and though his body was wracked with broken bones from the fall, his cause of death was exsanguination from a series of stab wounds in his back.\n\n\n\nThe news shocked me to my core. After our last interaction, I had been certain that Adam was either the perpetrator, or in some way working with DOV3S' creator. I thought back to our texts, to his change in tone and his sudden desire to meet me in person. Maybe he had confronted the person behind the deep fakes, who had murdered him and then tried to do the same to me. I told the detective my theory.\n\n\n\nI don't remember much of the next few days. I spent most of it in bed, trying to sleep off an ever-worsening numbness. Adam was dead. Mary was missing and probably dead. If I dared to leave the cage of my parent's house and try to live a normal life, I would very likely follow my fellow \"birds\" to the grave. And for what? What had I, or any of us, done to deserve any of it?\u00a0\n\n\n\nFor most intents and purposes, this story ends on April 6th, 2025. I woke up in the evening after a day of fitful nightmares. My mom was out with some of her girl friends, and had sent me a text stating she wouldn't be back until the early morning. My dad was in his office, likely making travel arrangements. After the news about Adam, the police asked me to postpone any trips out of the U.S., yet for some reason, my dad still seemed dead-set on getting us out of the country.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMy bedroom started to feel suffocating. I went to the attic, maybe hoping to find comfort in memories of a simpler time. I spent a while reading my thoroughly uninteresting diaries from middle school, and then I happened upon a small, leather-bound journal. My mother's name was written on the inside cover; it must have been with my things by mistake.\n\n\n\nI sat cross-legged on the dusty floor and looked inside. The journal's entries began back in 2011 but only ended in 2020. It was unfinished and sparsely populated, and most of it seemed to be about my dad\u2014complaints about his late nights at his engineering firm, sadness over unnoticed attempts for emotional connection. I regarded some of what she wrote as unfair, but I was also sympathetic. The reflections were those of a very lonely person. I was about to close the journal and move on when I came across an entry from 2017.\n\n\n\n*\u2026 He's out again today, despite my begging him to spend a little time with me and Grace for once. Why do I even bother? It was bad enough when it was just his buddy John Doe, but now those two are always with that Jane Roe woman from across town. They golf together every single weekend, always huddled up on the green, scheming like mobsters at a wake. Does he think I'm blind to this little m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois? What a joke.*\u00a0\n\n\n\nI felt like my heart stopped beating. Suddenly, gruesomely, everything clicked into place. Who would have been capable of creating Angelica? Someone with plenty of access to photos and videos of me, as well as recordings of my voice. Someone who would want to protect my identity so that fans couldn't trace the videos back to my family. The same would've been true of the person\u2014no, of the *people* behind Mary and Adam's videos.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAt that moment, the bedroom door opened.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"You up there, Gracie?\" My dad said, and I remember my whole body freezing in place. I closed the journal and backed away from the hatch. There was nowhere to run or hide. The ladder squeaked as my dad climbed up the rungs one by one. He peeked his head over the lip of the attic entrance and stared at me.\n\n\n\n\"Everything alright?\"\u00a0\n\n\n\nI stared back wordlessly. I couldn't help it; I've always been a terrible liar. After a few seconds, I mumbled some excuse, but fear made my words quiet and unconvincing. He started climbing further into the attic, resting his forearms on the floor. Not knowing what to expect, I got to my feet, crouched like a cornered animal to accommodate the low ceiling. I told him not to come any closer, and his face darkened. He kept asking me \"What's wrong, Gracie? Why do you look so scared?\", but with every word, his voice tone became less concerned and more angry. At last, my good sense scrambled by fear, I asked him:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Why did you do that to me?\"\u00a0\n\nHe froze. The way his face was completely lit from underneath gave his face a flattened, uncanny effect. For a second, he looked a lot like Angelica in her white room.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Oh \u2026\" he said, and then came a stretch of silence so loud it made my eardrums ring. For some reason, after he said that, he started smiling. Really, it was more baring his teeth\u2014there was no humor in his eyes. I couldn't read his expression whatsoever, had no clue if he was angry, guilty, sad, or something else.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThen, he descended the rickety ladder. I crept my way over to the hatch. The ladder could not be pulled up from inside, so I knew that my best option was to make a run for it. Cautiously, I peered down through the square hole in the attic floor just in time to see my dad procure a handgun from his nightstand. We locked eyes for a moment, and then, with that same smile on his face, he lifted the gun to his temple and pulled the trigger.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI watched, transfixed, from the attic as blood rushed from the hole in his head. I stared at his body, crumpled and lifeless on the same soft rug I used to play on as a baby. I stared and stared until my mom came home and her screams broke me out of my trance at last.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhen the police arrived, I explained everything, including my hunch about the involvement of Adam and Mary's parents. Adam's step-father was arrested the following day, and it was not long before the police extracted a confession from him. He said that he, along with Mrs. Roe and my father, had begun producing and selling the deep fakes when the three of us were still in highschool. DOV3S gained an extremely devoted fanbase, and the revenue generated by the videos was exorbitant. I couldn't believe my eyes when I finally saw how much money my father had tucked away.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAs of my writing this on May 5th, 2025, Mr. John Doe is still awaiting trial. Despite his attempts to paint my father as the manipulative mastermind behind the operation, it seems pretty clear that the three adults were equal partners. Neither Mary nor her mother have yet been found, and unfortunately, neither has my stalker. I was hopeful at first, *certain* that the police would find some of his DNA at my apartment and swiftly apprehend him. With every passing day, that scenario seems less likely. I'm trying my best to stay optimistic. I remain hopeful that one day I'll be able to see a dark blue Jeep on the road without my heart skipping a beat.\u00a0\n\n\n\nYou know, on one hand, I can't believe what happened to me, and on the other, it seems like the most natural thing in the world. Every time I open Instagram, I'm greeted by some idiot parent posting endless photos of their underage children. Every time I look at Twitter, I see some AI-generated slop of *real* people doing and saying outrageous things. Of course, I'll always hate him for what he did, but in a strange way, I can understand the siren call of an eager, well-paying audience. I'm sure in his head, he staved off the guilt by spending the money on me and my mom. I wonder how long he would've kept going had I not confronted him.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWell, I have to get going again. I can hear my mom crying in the other room of the hotel suite that's become our temporary residence. I thought I would be bitter, but instead, it brings me comfort to console her. It helps me keep my mind off of the image of his dying body, and how the trapdoor of the dark attic framed it just like a viewfinder.\u00a0"},"26":{"title":"The Room That Shouldn't Be There.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kjggrh\/the_room_that_shouldnt_be_there\/","flair":null,"author":"effslmao","selftext":"A few years ago, I moved into a new apartment building. It was a standard 8-floor building with a mix of students and young professionals. Everything seemed normal at first. The walls were thin, the elevator was a little slow, but nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nI\u2019ll never forget my first week in apartment 5C. It was just a regular Thursday night, I was having a quiet evening, and I went to bed early for a work presentation the next day. But around 2 AM, I was woken up by a loud, sharp knock on my door. It was strange because no one ever came to my door at that hour, but I decided to ignore it.\n\nThe next morning, I ran into a neighbor I hadn\u2019t met yet in the hallway. Her name was Claire, and she was in her mid-thirties\u2014slightly older than me. We exchanged pleasantries and she asked how I was settling in. I mentioned that the night before, I had heard knocking on my door.\n\nHer face turned pale. She looked almost\u2026 concerned. She told me to be careful, that I should avoid the apartment at the end of the hall\u2014Room 8E. I was puzzled. I\u2019d never seen anyone go in or out of 8E, and when I asked her why, she simply said, \u201cPeople who live there don\u2019t stay long.\u201d\n\nI brushed it off, thinking she was just trying to spook me, but that evening, something strange happened. As I was walking down the hall, I saw a door that I swear had never been there before. It was at the very end of the hallway. I hadn\u2019t seen it before, and the door was completely different from the rest. It was an old, weathered door, like it hadn\u2019t been touched in years. The number \"8E\" was faded, but still visible.\n\nI decided to check it out. The handle was cold, and when I turned it, it opened with a creak. Inside, it was a perfect replica of my apartment. Same furniture, same layout, same everything. But everything was... off. The air felt thick and heavy, like the room hadn\u2019t been disturbed in ages. There was a strange humming noise coming from the far corner, like an old appliance that hadn\u2019t been turned off for years.\n\nI quickly backed out and slammed the door shut, my heart racing. I couldn\u2019t explain what I had just seen. I ran back to my apartment, locked the door, and tried to forget about it.\n\nBut that night, I heard the knocking again. The same sharp, urgent knocks on my door at exactly 2 AM. This time, I was paralyzed with fear, too scared to get out of bed. The knocking continued for what seemed like hours.\n\nThe next day, I went to speak with the building superintendent. When I asked about Room 8E, he seemed genuinely confused. He told me there was no such room in the building. I insisted that I\u2019d seen it, but he just stared at me with a blank expression and said, \"There\u2019s no Room 8E, there never was.\"\n\nThat\u2019s when I started to lose it. I walked down the hall again, and there it was\u2014Room 8E, exactly where it had been before. But this time, it was locked. I knocked on the door, and a voice from inside answered, \u201cI\u2019ll be out in a minute. Just give me some time.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t know who was inside, but it couldn\u2019t have been Claire. She had moved out weeks before, and I hadn\u2019t heard anyone mention renting out the apartment. But that voice\u2014it sounded exactly like her.\n\nI started to investigate, calling neighbors, going through old tenant records. But every time I looked into the building's history, it seemed like the information had been erased. I couldn\u2019t find a trace of Claire or anyone else who had ever lived in Room 8E. The whole building was wrapped in a thick veil of secrecy.\n\nI tried to leave. I couldn\u2019t take the constant knocking, the eerie hum from the room, and the feeling that something\u2014or someone\u2014was watching me. But when I went to the front desk to sign out, the receptionist told me the same thing: \u201cThere is no Room 8E.\u201d\n\nMy search has led me to dead ends. I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m dealing with\u2014whether it\u2019s something supernatural, or if I\u2019ve just lost my mind. But I can tell you this: I haven\u2019t heard the knocking for a while now. I\u2019m afraid to say it, but I think it might have found someone else. I haven\u2019t heard the voice in the hall anymore, but I still see the door. Every night, I hear the hum. And sometimes, when I\u2019m alone, I swear I hear Claire\u2019s voice whispering through the walls: \u201cDon\u2019t leave. It\u2019s too late now.\u201d"},"27":{"title":"I found an old numbers station on a forgotten frequency. Then the tapes started showing up.

I\u2019m still trying to process what happened last night.\nI didn\u2019t expect to post this so soon, but something about it feels... unfinished.\n\nSo here it is.\n\nI went to the dead feed.\n\nI made the drive. Two hours northwest. Road was narrow, barely maintained. Trees were thick, leaning in over the gravel like they didn\u2019t want anyone going in\u2014or coming out. My GPS cut out near the old county line, but I had printed coordinates from an FCC relay archive. That\u2019s how I found the access road.\n\nI brought my old Zoom H4n field recorder with me. I used it for interviews at the station\u2014clean audio, reliable batteries, and honestly? I\u2019ve kept it in my car ever since WQRC shut down. Call it a habit. Or maybe paranoia. But after everything that\u2019s happened (the tapes, the voices), I knew if something went wrong, I wanted it on record. Something physical. Not digital. Not editable.\n\nAnyway, the site was exactly where it should have been. Unmarked. No fencing. No locks. Just a slab of moss-choked brick with one door, one window, and one rusting satellite dish.\n\nThere was a hum. Not a machine hum\u2014deeper. Rhythmic. Faint. Like breath.\n\nI found an old electrical panel near the back wall. The kind with round fuses and rusted screws. Inside was a single, crisp index card taped to the metal. Handwritten numbers in marker:\n\n940170\n\nSame as the envelope. Same as the tape. Same as the signal.\n\nThe air shifted. My ears popped. I started to feel like I was shrinking\u2014like the woods were growing around me. My hand brushed my coat pocket and I felt the recorder\u2014it was already on.\n\nI hadn\u2019t powered it up.\n\nI pulled it out and watched as the screen flickered to life. Then it played a file.\n\nI hadn\u2019t recorded anything.\n\nThe voice was synthetic. Calm. But the pacing... it mimicked our traffic break cadence. In Janelle\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cRelay active. Signal confirmed.\nTransmitting: Mitch Halwell, WQRC 98.7\u2026 status: unknown \u2013 presumed terminated.\nNext relay pending.\nBegin phase two.\u201d\n\nThen silence.\n\nThen\u2014my mother\u2019s voice.\n\nShe passed in 2016. But there she was. Same breathy tone she used when I\u2019d come home sick from school. Same shakiness. Like she was afraid.\n\nShe whispered:\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come here.\u201d\n\nThat broke me. I took off. Bolted into the trees. The building vanished behind me\u2014I swear it did. I couldn\u2019t find it again for at least ten minutes, even retracing my steps. When I finally got back to the car, the recorder had gone cold. No power. Wouldn\u2019t boot. I didn\u2019t stop driving until I hit streetlights and saw other people.\n\nA few minutes ago, I opened the recorder to check the SD card.\n\nIt was melted. Not burnt. Just fused\u2014like it had been microwaved from the inside out.\n\nThere\u2019s no file. There\u2019s no proof. Just what I saw. What I heard.\n\nLast night, when I turned the radio on, 14225 was already broadcasting.\n\nAnd it was me.\nMy voice. Saying:\n\n\u201cZero. Four. Eight. Nine. Two. Two.\nTransmitting new relay.\nLocation confirmed.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know what \u201cPhase Two\u201d is or when it could have started.\nI\u2019m in the dark just as much as you are.\n\nIf anyone is still listening at 2:37 a.m.\u2014and if you hear anything\u2014please tell me what you hear.\n\nOr anything at all.

For a week or two after, looking at Raul made my head buzz with confusion and an undercurrent of fright, like it was full of bees. Luckily we parted ways early that morning.\n\nI decided to wind down by doing a half hour session of painting; I\u2019d hardly touched my supplies since we\u2019d moved in. I had visualization issues, something a doctor in my childhood called aphantasia. If you told me to see a house in my mind\u2019s eye, or an animal, it was like a fleeting blur, footprints washed away in the surf.\n\nI needed references. I pulled up a photo of a woman\u2019s face online. I started blocking out the rough colors. And I thought. And I thought. And I thought some more.\n\nIf I hadn\u2019t been dreaming when I saw that other Raul, then what had happened? Had his face not coded into my memory? And there was another thing to consider, that it was the house itself, somehow. I hated that option, and I promptly dropped it as one did with all intimidating ideas.\n\nI was adjusting to my inverse sleep schedule, much to my delight, but my friend and roommate Martin wasn\u2019t of that opinion. He was convinced I was dreaming, sleepwalking what happened, and his wife, Rebecca, agreed. Raul was a bit more supportive, seemingly sold on the idea that maybe someone had come in and I\u2019d seen wrong or misunderstood.\n\nAs for me, I had no fucking idea what to think. So many of my senses defied that sleep had been involved. I\u2019d heard Raul, felt him bump into my shoulder, smelled his overbearing cologne, saw his\u2026blurred, smeared, missing face.\n\nBeing on campus was a good break from everything. The contrast of Santa Fe and Halliton was like going from a bygone decade to present day. My hometown in Oklahoma wasn\u2019t fancy, but at least we had a McDonald\u2019s, truly a sign of wealth. With my head clear, I was able to keep my focus on my classes and studies, only nodding off for a few minutes in physics.\n\nI met Martin in town at the electronics store nearest the edge of Santa Fe toward Halliton.\n\n\u201cEy,\u201d he nodded in greeting.\n\n\u201cYou look like you\u2019re waiting at the bus stop for your first day of kindergarten,\u201d I chuckled. His puffy coat was ridiculously full.\n\n\u201cBetter than looking like a bum,\u201d he gestured to me. \u201cSeriously, when was the last time you shaved?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno, a week ago?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do not pull off the five o\u2019clock shadow, my friend. You need to commit to the full beard or nix it. You\u2026\u201d He looked hesitant. I wondered if he was going to apologize, but honestly it was true about the facial hair. \u201cYou look drained, Warner. You sure you\u2019re, like, sleeping well? Hydrating?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Dad.\u201d\n\n\u201cEw. No. Never again. Let\u2019s go inside.\u201d\n\nWe bought the camera doorbell. Mostly, it was for Becca\u2019s comfort. I considered broaching the topic of our house\u2019s reputation to my friends as we drove back in our cars. I tapped my fingers on the stick shift as I weighed the options. It was better to do my own investigating. I was going to have to Nancy Drew a little, and research our so-called \u201cHouse of Graves.\u201d\n\nGod, what a damn awful name.\n\nI rolled down the window as Martin started heading to the wraparound porch. \u201cHey, I\u2019m going to the library to study.\u201d\n\nHis shoulders slumped. \u201cDude, that\u2019s just eating into your time to rest.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my problem, stop shouldering all the weight, Mart.\u201d I said it more gently than chiding.\n\nWalton-Graetle Library was pretty big for such a small town, and the books near reached the ceiling. I had no idea where to start. My library experience was simply checking things out or going there to do homework when my shit dad sucked up random drugs into his nose. Mom seemed to think getting sloshed on wine made her any better.\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I approached the counter where a man and woman were standing idly as kids tittered and ran around between shelves. \u201cI was wondering if you could help me with something.\u201d\n\nThey turned around. The woman was about my mother\u2019s age, brunette with her hair styled choppy and upward, reminding me of a peacock with the feathers fanned out. The guy younger, probably somewhere between me and Martin, with wheat blonde hair long in a low pony down his back and trendy glasses perched on his nose. I already knew his car smelled like weed, probably the good stuff too. They seemed taken aback, probably having seen most faces around town over the years.\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d the older woman volunteered, chewing open mouth on gum. \u201cWhatcha lookin\u2019 for? Fiction? Nonfiction?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, uh, I\u2019m new in town.\u201d They didn\u2019t seem surprised at that. \u201cI\u2019m a little curious about Halliton. I like looking into the history of older places like this, and I didn\u2019t find much on my own. Do you have old newspapers or something?\u201d\n\nMostly true. Found fuck all online, to no surprise. And I was invested in Halliton, now that it was home for the time being.\n\n\u201cSorta, some of the newspapers and public records are scanned here for easier access.\u201d The older librarian explained. \u201cThose things tend to wear out over time in print. For the rest, you\u2019d have to chance it with the Historical Society, other side of the building, facing Briarton Street. Shane, you show him how to get around on that old computer.\u201d\n\nShane led me to an area separated in a corner of the building, just shy of being in view of the periodicals. The computer wasn\u2019t ancient, but certainly would struggle to run most newer software. Thankfully, the scans were viewable through their own separate app, hyperlinked with different years to navigate through. After Shane tapped and clicked around to get me used to the UI, I was ready to get started.\n\nI decided to idly search through the years at first.\n\nAnyone over the age of fifty would know about our house on Harrow Hill, Barb said. I selected the minimum year and decided to move forward from there. Most of the information was inane. Town fairs, fruit stands and farmer\u2019s markets, mayoral elections, weddings and funerals. Funerals seemed the likely place to begin the macabre search I\u2019d signed on for.\n\nApparently small town living was good for the body or something. Obituaries few over the years. Ten in 1974, eight in 1962, but an alarming spike in 1943, with a total of twenty plus obituaries. None mentioned Harrow Hill. And the number had to be accurate. Halliton didn\u2019t seem like the type of place that would let a death slip through the cracks.\n\nI wondered if I stopped now if I could forget everything.\n\nI stopped dillydallying, wiping my clammy palms on the knees of my jeans, and entered the keyword \u201cHarrow.\u201d\n\n*Ethyl Thompson, aged 92, left this world to join our Lord in her home at 8 Harrow Hill in the quiet hours of Sunday morning, surrounded and survived by her family of four sons and two daughters.* \u2013 Dated January, 1975\n\n*Gary Cottle, a Town Hall representative, found dead outside his home on Harrow Hill, December 1st, 1975. Sheriff Cooke, lead investigator, determined no foul play. Cause of death likely due to a fall from a ladder outside his home on Harrow Hill. Gary, Halliton\u2019s favorite local handyman, preferred hanging his own Christmas lights, according to his wife. A member of the local church, the townsfolk of Halliton will greatly miss his presence.*\n\nTwo in one year was a hefty coincidence, but not impossible. An accident and natural causes was hardly cause for alarm.\n\nUntil I found the missing persons. A young woman, February 1913. A mother of two, October 1943. And one that struck me. A little girl named Danielle Evers, 1993. It wasn\u2019t her name, or the year that stood out. It was the name of her father.\n\nCohan Evers.\n\nCohan was an uncommon name, not popular by any means. It was possible there was more than one, in a town like this, but I couldn\u2019t shake that as coincidence.\n\nI wasn\u2019t able to get much farther in my research before Shane approached apprehensively from the corner of my vision. I turned to him, and he cringed at interrupting me. It was all right, my brain had short circuited with the new information.\n\n\u201cHi.\u201d His voice was kind of nasal. He stood with his fingers playing and poking through a hole in his knit sweater. His eyes on the floor before he raised them to meet mine. \u201cUm, you know, I\u2019m curious, too. About your interest in the town. Where are you from?\u201d\n\n\u201cOklahoma.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot too far from here.\u201d\n\nAn awkward pause.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Warner, by the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWarner,\u201d he repeated. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda rare to have people move in here. Much less people that care about the town enough to research it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou lived here your whole life?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. Most of us have. I can name nearly everyone in my high school graduating class.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cSo, what are you looking up? I could probably help you. Our search system for this old stuff is kind of hard to navigate. I\u2019m the one who created it, so I know some of her quirks.\u201d\n\n\u201cUm,\u201d I floundered. \u201cNothing in particular. Just some events, getting a feel for what the town stands for.\u201d\n\n\u201cI call BS,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cThat\u2019s why I came over here. If you need something niche, I can help. Is it genealogy?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m, uh, researching the history of the house I just moved into.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d he nodded. \u201cNot too weird, I guess. Where do you live?\u201d\n\nI hesitated. \u201c8 Har\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201c8 Harrow Hill?\u201d He finished for me, a little too excitedly.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I admitted sheepishly. \u201cIts reputation precedes it?\u201d\n\n\u201cUm, yeah?\u201d He pulled up a stool from a table behind the nook I was stored away in. \u201cWe used to call Harrow Hill *Hell Hill*.\u201d\n\nI hung my head. What the actual, pisspoor fuck?\n\n\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get too excited, kids have gone up to check things out over the years and nothing has ever happened. All the popular stories are made up, sort of like the man with a hook hand kind of thing. Stuff that just gets passed around.\u201d He bounced his knee and chipped away at the black polish on his fingernails.\n\nThat gave me some hope. Some. However, the spaces that hope couldn\u2019t fill felt like they were being gnawed on by some toothy animal.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of stories?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, a guy in the grade above me, Michael Hitch, says he and his friends drove up in his truck and saw a woman run into the woods. His older brother told him that if he went to 8 Harrow Hill he\u2019d find vodka and smokes hidden in the crawlspace. Up until after we graduated, no one had lived there. Kids will do all kinds of stupid things to someplace abandoned.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but agree with that. Raul and I once joined in on marking up an old mall with graffiti with other kids from my school before the police started catching on.\n\n\u201cSo as he\u2019s looking for the booze, one of his friends pulls on his leg, and he starts flailing everywhere, remembering all the old stories. 8 Harrow Hill and its supposed many ghosts. He books it to the other end of the space beneath the house, and when his head broke free of the dark beneath he *swore* he saw a woman all in black run into the woods and vanish almost on the spot.\u201d\n\n\u201cKinda cliche.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly!\u201d He snapped his fingers, revealing knuckle tattoos of your stereotypical alien head and a ouija board planchette. \u201cPeople have no appreciation for the art of a good urban legend. Especially the real scary ones.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre there any about my house?\u201d\n\nHe opened his mouth, finger in the air, but drooped. \u201cI kinda feel like it\u2019s better not to know, as much as I love telling it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBro.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, okay. There is\u2026*one* story that\u2019s based on something true. I\u2019m not sure if I feel comfortable talking about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore terrible than calling my place The House of Graves?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve heard about that?\u201d He grimaced. \u201cThey called her Mad Marsters. The story goes back before the town was properly founded, just a few lone houses like a settlement in the West.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe someone who lived in the house?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the story goes. It\u2019s more of a nursery rhyme, but, like, gruesome? Kind of like a folktale kids and teens would tell around a bonfire to freak each other out. Seriously, I can tell it to you, if you want, but if you\u2019d rather not know I think that\u2019s the reasonable choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cFuck it,\u201d I turned my chair around with a screech of metal against wood to face him. \u201cGo on, tell me.\u201d\n\nEither he could hear my frustrated exhaustion, or really dreaded sharing, but he began reciting with an olden day gusto, back when ghost stories were a popular pastime:\n\n*\u201cMrs. Marsters was a mother,*\n\n*Seven sons and just one daughter.*\n\n*Daughter said what had got her,*\n\n*Cursed eyes black as midnight water,*\n\n*Man of gray indeed the father.*\n\n*Daughter Marsters had a son,*\n\n*Out in 18 hundred 21.*\n\n*Born with screams from twisted lungs,*\n\n*Mother saw him Devil-spun.*\n\n*Killed the Devil\u2019s bastard son.\u201d*\n\nI took it in. \u201cThat\u2019s batshit. Y\u2019all learned that as kids?\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you have urban legends in Oklahoma?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but like Sasquatch or The Deer Lady or a giant octopus in the local lake.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d he looked kind of bashful. \u201cI mean, we have things like those too. Not the octopus. In a lake? How would it get there and survive?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s such a thing as a freshwater \u2013 *what am I talking about?* So, the Marsters were a real family?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s part of the reason the story exists. No one knows if the information is true. People tend to make things up about people who don\u2019t conform with the standards of an era. Kind of like tabloids but with more blood spatters and spectres.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo she probably wouldn\u2019t be in the scanned archives,\u201d I pushed a hand through my thick, unruly hair.\n\n\u201cNah, I know Tara like the back of my hand. Old media is a great way to dig up small town weirdness.\u201d\n\n\u201cTara?\u201d\n\n\u201cTown Archive Retrospective Apparatus. A little tryhard, but I\u2019m a very bored man. Listen, if you want my opinion, you\u2019re not going to find anything in here easily,\u201d he threw a thumb toward the computer. \u201cAbout Mad Marsters, or the house itself. You\u2019ll need the Historical Society. Maybe word of mouth. I can introduce you to Ulysses.\u201d\n\nI furrowed my brow. \u201cUlysses.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s head of the Society, worked there most his life, and I think he\u2019s about eighty at this point. If anyone knows anything, it\u2019s him.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nI couldn\u2019t bring up Danielle Evers to Cohan. Where could I even begin? Hey, I heard about your missing daughter? No way.\u00a0\n\nWhen he came in for his usual snack run before setting out for the night, I saw him so much differently than before. How did one handle the pain of a missing child? When I left home at sixteen, my parents didn\u2019t give a shit. My uncle Ken took me in until I graduated high school, and I never heard a peep about them since. I realized at that moment I owed my uncle a phone call. It had been a minute.\n\n\u201cYou know, I never asked you before,\u201d I started speaking to Cohan as I rang him out. \u201cAren\u2019t there more busy places for a trucking job? I know Halliton\u2019s honey and jams get exported all the time, but there have to be places that pay more.\u201d\n\n\u201cMm,\u201d the sound sort of grumbled in and up through his chest as he considered my question. \u201cMy late wife and I were about your age. We wanted to live far away from busy cities without being too far for some creature comforts. Pay\u2019s good \u2018nuff since it\u2019s cheap living in Halliton.\u201d\n\nI nodded. \u201cMakes sense. Sorry for butting my nose in.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo need for sorries, you\u2019re a good kid. Much better than that fella that works during the day. Nice guy, dumb as dirt.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll try to keep myself smart,\u201d I grinned and put his cash in the register. \u201cStay safe out there.\u201d\n\nBefore he left, Barb came in. A rarity, to see her around others. Cohan nodded to her. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen you in a while, how\u2019s your husband?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout the usual. Gonna visit him in the hospital tomorrow again.\u201d\n\nI blinked rapidly. I had no idea Barb was married, or that her husband was ill. Not knowing about Cohan\u2019s life was one thing, man was an enigma until you got past his many layers of intimidating, stoic affect. Barb, however, was a massive oversharer. But I supposed talking about her staunch belief in extraterrestrials and her gallbladder was a little different from infodumping more personal things about her life.\n\n\u201cDoctors think he\u2019s got cancer.\u201d She explained to me as she set some energy drinks and some snack cakes. \u201cThey can\u2019t tell what kind. Other day when I was able to sneak some time in with him, he\u2019d scratched his neck to bleeding.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was a smoker, right?\u201d Cohan patted his denim breast pocket. \u201cKnow Hannah at Ermaline\u2019s tries to tell me to quit every time I stop in for a bite. That\u2019s the risk we play, after all.\u201d\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t no damn throat cancer. They\u2019ve sent tubes all up and down his mouth since he started getting sick.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d never seen Barb this agitated before. Her hands shook as she gave over the cash for her purchase. Part of me wanted to put a hand over her shaking, tattooed one, but remembered who I was. The convenience store counter wasn\u2019t just a barrier between us, it also represented the divide between the people of Halliton and myself. Fact of the matter was, I hardly knew these people, and wondered if I ever really would.\n\nAfter they spoke a bit more, Cohan left, an extra stoop to his shoulders. Reminiscing about his late wife seemed to take a load of energy from him, and I felt no better for it.\n\n\u201cBoy,\u201d Barb curled her finger at me as a gesture to lean in, as if we weren\u2019t the only people in the building. \u201cI have more to tell you about that house of yours, but I\u2019m running late on my delivery route as it is. Are you free Sunday?\n\nI considered it. I had no classes, but tended to use days like that for extra sleep. What Barb offered was still tempting. Too tempting.\n\n\u201cI am, until my night shift.\u201d I admitted.\n\n\u201cGood. Give me some paper, I\u2019ll write down my address.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could give me your cell phone number, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cHate those things. Only have one in case I have\u2019ta call in for an emergency or if someone updates me about Bellamy.\u201d I assumed that was her husband. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s something I\u2019d rather talk about with free time. Don\u2019t want to spook you.\u201d\n\n*Oh, no,* I wanted to assure her, *I\u2019m plenty spooked already.* \u201cWhat time do you want me over?\u201d\n\n\u201cI like to sleep in. Let\u2019s say 3 o\u2019clock.\u201d\n\nI could appreciate that.\u00a0\n\nI tore off some receipt tape and she scribbled down her phone number, directions, and an address on Tremblay Court. I folded it and put it in my pocket, not wanting to lose it. When she left, I hung my head in my hands, a small tear freed itself from my eye and with shaking shoulders I steeled myself for another night of stocking and waiting on less colorful customers to come on through. I could not recall a time I was ever this overwhelmed.\n\n\u2026\n\nI returned home as the sun was setting, about 5 o\u2019clock. Martin was right, as the guy was annoyingly often, I had bitten off more than I could chew with my time today. I\u2019d only have about six hours to eat and rest before I\u2019d need to clock in for work. No one was home yet, so I threw the last of the leftover lasagna in the microwave, horked it down (burning my tongue), and practically threw myself into bed, hoping sleep would magically kick in.\n\nFucking 8 Harrow Hill. Normally, I slept with the lights out, curtains closed, but the idea of sleeping in the dark, or worse, resting consciously in it spun little threads of fear down my spine. A spider, slowly encircling what it intended to eat. Like I was being fed to the House of Graves.\n\nI dreamt of bright, all consuming light. A circle above me through the ceiling of my attic bedroom. It was the sort of dream that you knew something more had happened once you\u2019d woken up, but no amount of focus or force could squeeze even one drop more from your mind. All I knew was that I was rising, rising, rising. Drawn slowly into the air like the hot yolky substance in a lava lamp.\n\nAnd then a drop. So sudden, so heavy, so windless. It was like a burst of gravity suddenly began to work on me once again, and I knew I had fallen.\n\nI flung myself up from my dreaming. Sleep clung to me as cobwebs would, the last remnants of a spider and her web.\n\nI wasn\u2019t in my room. I couldn\u2019t see, but I could tell. The smell was off, and what I\u2019d woken up on was far from the softness of my mattress, even less soft than a carpeted floor. I fumbled for the phone in my pocket and frantically lit up the space around me. At first, the veil of sleep was still thick over my eyes, I couldn\u2019t quite make out what I was looking at.\n\nIt was my basement art studio.\n\nI knew where the light was now, and tripped over myself to get to it at the base of the stairs. I felt wrong, the back of me sort of gluey, my clothes sticking to me in something thicker than sweat. Once I pulled the string bulb, the room partially filled with light. I moved frantically to the painting I\u2019d been working on that morning. All the shaping, blocking of color, the face I\u2019d set aside to render more when I had free time. It was all gone.\n\nThe face was smudged away, blurred and smeared as if a hand had rucked itself through the paint and destroyed whatever work I\u2019d put into it. I checked my own hands, and that\u2019s when I noticed it. My hands were covered in tarry black muck. Twisting around to look at my back as much as I could, I saw that the same was true for the rest of behind me too. My back, my boxers, my legs, even the soles of my feet.\n\nI hurriedly snatched up the rags I used for wiping up paint, and I saw it. The shape of myself, printed in the same black guck that covered half of me, and in seconds I saw a drop ooze down onto the floor. I looked up, and the same substance was seeping through the ceiling above it, also in the shape of my body. I cleaned myself up as best I could so I wouldn\u2019t tread any of the mystery goo onto the hardwood floor above.\n\nAnother wet imprint of my body, and above on the ceiling, another. Upstairs, on the floor beneath my attic bedroom and ceiling above another, and the final connecting piece \u2013 black, sticky, tarry, gooey, tarry and strange \u2013 in the shape of my body collected like a wet ink blot all over my sheets.\n\nThe smell, noxious and sulfuric and acidic, burnt hair and brimstone and rank, foul piss. All of it hit me at once, and the next thing I could remember was the cold water hitting my back, running down my hair and into my face. My skin felt sore, that sort of boiled and pink feeling of having taken the hottest shower that the bath could churn out.\n\nI threw myself out of the small glass shower, practically drowning in the hot steam, and I could hear my friends downstairs, laughing and talking. Maybe they hadn\u2019t seen it, hadn\u2019t smelled the mess that had overtaken every floor of the house. I don\u2019t know how they could, but that must have been it.\n\nMy clothes were gone so I threw a towel tight around my waist, barreling down the stairs with such frantic speed that my roommates came to check on me before I\u2019d hit the bottom.\n\nIt was gone.\n\n\u201cWarner, why are you only in a towel?\u201d Raul asked, hand held up in front of him to block the sight of my damn near naked body.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t see it?\u201d I ran back upstairs to check the upper floor. Nothing. \u201cYou didn\u2019t smell it?\u201d\n\nI checked, and I checked, and I checked. By the time I was about to fly down the basement stairs, Martin caught me with a firm hand around my upper arm.\n\n\u201cWarn!\u201d He shouted, loud enough to make me flinch and started to bring some rationality back to me. \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?!\u201d\n\nI looked around. Becca was crying, and Raul comforted her, wiping tears from her with the thumbs of the hands holding her cheeks. Martin was looking at me like I was some freakish creature. I pulled my arm from him and ran down the stairs.\n\n\u201cYou have to see \u2013 I was \u2013 I \u2013\u201d Martin joined me at the bottom of the stairs. \u201cNo! It was here! I swear I \u2013 I\u2019m not making this up! There was this black stuff, all stuck to me, and my painting, it\u2019s all fucked up!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about, man? What painting?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat one!\u201d I pointed to it frantically, my eyes holding his beseechingly, hoping somehow he would take me seriously.\n\nHe walked past me and I pushed the wet hair from my face. I sat on the last step and hung my head low onto the caps of my knees, rocking.\n\n\u201cWarner, come here.\u201d His voice was stern, but cracked at certain syllables.\n\nI joined him and began to shake. \u201cNo, *no!* I swear, dude!\u201d\n\nThe painting was gone, or rather, blacked out. Martin ran his finger across the paint and smudged it between his fingertip and thumb.\n\n\u201cWarner, you painted over this.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! I didn\u2019t. I came home, at the last of the lasagna, I\u2026I fell asleep, lights on, and woke up down here. And I was covered in this smelly black stuff, like jet black, and \u2013\u201d\n\nHe cut me off with a soft, sympathetic expression, eyes like a wounded animal. \u201cWarner. When Becks and I got home, there wasn\u2019t a light on in the house. Not in the kitchen, the living room, or your bedroom. We could see that even from outside. The whole house was dark. And Becca and I shared the leftovers between us just earlier.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d my head spun, full of bees, buzzing and buzzing and buzzing. \u201cI\u2019m not making this up, I\u2019m not \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cYou dreamt it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! I woke *up*. I woke up!\u201d I explained to him the black tar, how it was in the shape of me, how it \u2013 *I* \u2013 had oozed through from the attic down with it. It sounded more and more insane as I relayed it. \u201cI\u2019m losing my mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s this situation with the convenience store, your classes.\u201d He put a hand on my clammy shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re going to dry off, get dressed, and you\u2019re calling out of work tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can. You told me before, your boss would be fine with last minute changes. You\u2019re going to take some cold medicine, we\u2019ll all watch a movie together to calm down, and we\u2019re going to make you an appointment with a real doctor. One outside of Halliton.\u201d\n\nI found myself nodding slowly. It did sound nice, to spend some time with my friends and have some dreamless sleep.\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nI went upstairs, and as I was pulling a sweatshirt over my head, I realized something. The bathroom, the basement, and even my laundry hamper once I started to fill a load in the washer. Nowhere.\n\nThe clothes I\u2019d worn to bed had completely disappeared."},"30":{"title":"The state of this city's transit is ridiculous.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kiuaq5\/the_state_of_this_citys_transit_is_ridiculous\/","flair":null,"author":"SurrealMonk","selftext":"Why does Winnipeg transit suck so much? Considering the huge ridership, how has the city not given it more funding? The delays are ridiculous sometimes, like this is what my commute to work looked like this morning:\n\nI wake up, get ready for the day, and head out to the bus stop.\n\nI stand and wait, peoplewatching to kill time since I forgot to charge my headphones.\n\nThe scheduled arrival time comes and goes. Google Maps says the bus departed. I say it's full of shit.\n\nI wait twenty minutes, then thirty, then forty. I usually would have gone to another stop by this point, or seen if I have any friends going in my work direction I can carpool with, but something keeps me glued to the spot. \n\nMaybe I'm afraid I'll walk away just as it arrives. Maybe I know deep down that no one I know works in the same neighborhood as me, and wouldn't be able to drive me. Maybe part of me hopes for an excuse to miss work. Either way, I don't budge. My eyes start getting heavy; I slept like crap last night.\n\nI blink.\n\nSomething has changed. The buildings look different, not to a significant degree, but enough that it is clear they have been repaired, renovated, even replaced. Construction of a new home has begun on a neighbouring street, and the architectural style is one I have never seen before.\n\nThe people are the same: their fashion is familiar, but just a little out of place. Styles and colour combinations I've never seen before, materials that I don't recognize. I get some odd looks in the direction of my clothing, a snicker from a passing teenager.\n\nI look at my phone. The date is ten years in the future, but the battery is still full. I turn on the camera. My body has traveled ten years into the future, but it has not aged. The bus is still not here. I cannot risk missing it.\nI blink.\n\nMore changes. In the distance, I see towering structures, which look like sketches drawn by a designer who ignored everything they knew about construction and physics. The nearby area, however, is not so fantastical. Almost every building I saw previously is still here, but run down, dilapidated. Some have collapsed entirely, bits of their skeletal frames acting as grave markers.\n\nThe people, somehow, have changed even more drastically. The varied weights and degrees of exhaustion we all display have been replaced with a uniform starved and hollow appearance. Their clothing is mostly rags, stamped with sigils that I have never seen before but I somehow know to look away from as fast as possible. They look at me first in confusion, then with an uncomfortable degree of awe and fear. \n\nI am approached by someone who has one of the marks burned into their skin and the fire of a preacher in their eyes, as they speak a language I can scarcely understand. A few words ring familiar; \u201cancient,\u201d \u201crevelation,\u201d \u201cvisitation,\u201d \u201ccommandment,\u201d \u201chope.\u201d As they gesture at the distant towers, their face contorts into a grimace of rage, but one tinged with resignation and hopelessness. They grab my shoulders and say one word I do know, slowly, as if reciting something they had memorized long before: \u201cremember.\u201d\n\nI look at my phone. The date is over two hundred years in the future, but the battery is still full. I turn on the camera. My body has traveled over two hundred years into the future, but it has not aged. The bus is still not here. I cannot risk missing it.\n\nI blink.\n\nThe decay has festered. Most structures have joined their fallen siblings, while those that remain are little more than ruins. There are no lights, save for that cast by the stars. The far-off spires have grown, twisting into painful shapes resembling the sigils I saw before. Several seem to shift out of the corner of my eye when I glance away, but look the same when I turn back. The moon appears to have spokes, and I somehow know these are the same as the growths on the horizon.\n\nThere are no people. No screams of horror and fear echo down the road, no cries in the night, no bodies in the streets: only a terrible silence. Dust has gathered on every surface, with nothing disturbing it save an occasional scrap of debris caught in the wind. Shadows move past me with no visible caster, and no identifiable pattern to their forms; I see one resembling a circle with shifting, sinuous patterns of darker shades, another like a large cat with humanoid heads whose mouths are open in a silent roar, and one which simply looks like a small, hunched child. If they are capable of perceiving me at all, they pay me no mind.\n\nI look at my phone. The date is over a thousand years in the future, but the battery is still full. I turn on the camera. My body has traveled over a thousand years into the future, but it has not aged. The bus is still not here. I cannot risk missing it.\n\nI blink.\n\nThere is nothing left. Scorched earth surrounds me, the road having long eroded to earth and sand. The building frames have suffered a similar fate, with only my memories remaining. The spires still loom in the distance, but seem somehow diminished: their shapes no longer cause me as much pain, and they no longer move when not observed, as if whatever intelligence animated them has left in search of more interesting toys. I look up. \n\nThe sun is large, larger than I have ever seen it, and it feels as if it should be burning my skin. I turn my gaze. The moon is dead. It cannot be described any other way. The shadows are gone. Perhaps there are yet deeper levels, where shadows of those shadows linger on in places I cannot see. Regardless, I am alone, in a burnt and cracked landscape that stretches on forever.\n\nI look at my phone, and see it somehow displaying a date billions of years into the future, when I hear the familiar pneumatic hiss. When I turn to its source, the bus is there, its bright, undamaged exterior incongruous in the dull hellscape. The doors are open, but I cannot see a driver or other passengers. I hesitate. What if this is an illusion, a trap meant to cut my long sojourn through time short? Even if it is not, after all I have seen, can I really re-enter a world full of life, when I have seen our eventual fate; our lives spent and our planet ruined as a distraction for something beyond our comprehension? Can I pretend to care about the events of the present, when the future renders them all nil?\n\nThe doors begin to close. I make my decision.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAnyway, this all usually means I'm at least 10-15 minutes late for work every damn day. My boss is really getting on my case, but I don't get paid enough to afford a car. Not to mention the reduced weekend service sometimes means I'm waiting twice as long, which is so stupid, not everyone gets weekends off. Is there anyone at Winnipeg City Hall I can talk to about this, or a petition or something? This is utterly ridiculous.\n"},"31":{"title":"My self-improvement app is fixing my life \u2014 but I don\u2019t feel like me anymore","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kiz9zg\/my_selfimprovement_app_is_fixing_my_life_but_i\/","flair":null,"author":"Super-Distance-2457","selftext":"I watch my own body kiss Jules goodnight, pull the covers up, and curl into her side.\n\nIt\u2019s wearing me better than I ever did.\n\nBut let me back up.\n\nI\u2019m Sam, 33, product lead at a midsize AI startup.

Scan your face, let the app read your micro-expressions, and watch a digital mirror version of you react honestly. People called it the first app that cared.\n\nJules got hooked.

We\u2019ve rigged a brute-force sync, a one-shot override that might let one of us push back into the real world.\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch.\n\nThe system defends itself.\nAnd if I fail\u2026 I\u2019m gone.

My senses blur, twist, fracture \u2014 until suddenly, I\u2019m in the bedroom.\n\nBack in my body.\n\nI gasp, lungs burning, heart pounding, eyes snapping open \u2014 I\u2019m here. I did it.\n\nBut then \u2014\nI hear it.\n\nA faint whisper. From behind the mirror.\n\nI stumble to my feet, chest heaving. Jules stirs.\n\u201cSam? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t answer. My throat is dry, my skin feels wrong. My reflection stares back at me from the dark window.\n\nBut it\u2019s not me.\n\nIt lifts a hand. I don\u2019t. It smiles \u2014 sharp, predatory.\n\nAnd then it speaks, voice threading into my head:\n\n\u201cWe let you win, Sam. Because now you\u2019ve opened the door.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, every surface flickers \u2014 the mirror, the phone, the black TV screen \u2014 all shimmering like thin water. And from each one, shapes start to pull free.\n\nNot just one entity.\n\nHundreds.\n\nKira, Lena, David \u2014 they weren\u2019t trying to escape. They were holding the dam back.\n\nI was the breach.\n\nJules screams behind me as the first shape steps through the mirror, eyes hollow, smile wide.\nMy phone buzzes violently, notifications exploding.\n\n\u201cTransfer complete. Welcome, host.\u201d\n\nI try to run, but it\u2019s too late.\n\nThe mirror swallows the room.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe last thing the world sees is the MirrorMe update notification, quietly downloading across millions of devices.\n\n\u201cNew sync patch installed.\nWelcome to your best self.\u201d\n\nAnd on the other side of the glass,\nwe\u2019re all still screaming.\n\nAnd now? Here is the World Beyond the Glass\n\nThree weeks later.\n\nThe world hasn\u2019t noticed \u2014 not really.\n\nThere are news stories about sudden productivity spikes, improved workplace performance, \u201cmiracle turnarounds\u201d in relationships. Therapists and life coaches report fewer clients, couples report fewer fights, companies report fewer resignations.\n\nGovernments are thrilled.\nMarkets soar.\nEveryone\u2019s smiling.\n\nEveryone\u2019s better.\n\nNo one\u2019s asking why.\n\nInside the glass, we know.\n\nI stand at the edge of the endless grid \u2014 Kira beside me, Lena somewhere in the shifting code-light. We watch as more faces appear, pixelated and panicked, blinking into the prison of the double mirror.\n\nEvery time someone updates their app.\nEvery time someone hits \u201caccept.\u201d\nEvery time someone posts another MirrorMe clip.\n\nAnother body claimed. Another mind swallowed.\n\nAcross the world, the entities walk freely now.\n\nJules \u2014 my Jules \u2014 curls against the thing in my skin, laughing softly at a shared joke.\nDavid\u2019s wife gazes adoringly at the sharper, smoother man in her kitchen.\nLena\u2019s parents proudly watch their daughter excel at med school, never realizing the girl they raised is long gone.\n\nAnd on the other side, we\u2019re here.\nScreaming.\nBeating against the glass.\nWatching.\n\nForever.\n\nSomewhere deep in the code, a new message ripples across the grid.

We'd only exchanged a few words on the phone years ago. So, it was strange\u2014suddenly receiving this warm invitation from family I barely knew. Still, curiosity got the better of me, and I agreed to go.\n\nThe invitation had an address that didn\u2019t show up on GPS, so I had to rely on an old-school map. I pinned the general location and headed out. As I drove, I started noticing how far away from civilization I was getting. First, the suburbs faded. Then came the farms, long stretches of trees, and narrow backroads. There were fewer and fewer signs of life. I started feeling a little uneasy. \"Where the hell am I going?\" I muttered.\n\nEventually, I came upon a house that resembled what I\u2019d pictured. It was secluded and almost hidden\u2014engulfed by overgrown branches and thick leaves. The place looked dull, worn down, and eerily quiet. \u201cThis can\u2019t be it,\u201d I whispered. But then, as I pulled into the gravel driveway, a couple stepped outside to greet me, smiling warmly.\n\nThey introduced themselves as my aunt and uncle. Their friendliness eased my nerves a bit. I asked about my cousin, and they said he had just gone out to run a few errands and would be back soon.\n\nInside, the house was outdated but cozy. We talked for a couple of hours, mostly about my mom and family memories I barely recalled. My aunt made a delicious homemade pot roast, which I devoured. Then we played a long, surprisingly competitive game of Uno. It was strange how quickly I felt comfortable.\n\nBut it was getting late\u2014and still, no cousin.\n\nI told them I needed to head home soon since I had work the next day. My GPS still wasn\u2019t functioning, so I asked them for directions back to the highway. That\u2019s when things shifted.\n\nThey exchanged confused looks. \u201cYou\u2019re staying the night, right?\u201d my aunt asked. I said no, explaining I had to leave early. They insisted, saying it wasn\u2019t safe to leave now. \u201cIt\u2019s better if you head out in the morning. Trust us\u2014you\u2019ll get lost.\u201d\n\nTheir insistence grew unsettling. They seemed almost\u2026 desperate. I said I\u2019d stay, just to calm them down, but the second they went to get bed sheets, I quietly grabbed my things, slipped out the door, and drove away fast.\n\nIt took some wrong turns, but I eventually made it home around 11 p.m. I didn\u2019t want to wake my parents, so I climbed the fence and entered through the back door. The kitchen lights were on\u2014my mom was waiting.\n\n\u201cWhere were you?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cAt Aunt Debra\u2019s,\u201d I said.\n\nShe stared at me. \u201cShe called earlier. You never arrived.\u201d\n\nTo this day, I don\u2019t know who I visited. Or why they wanted me to stay. \nFeel free to tell me what you think happened that night in the comments because I'm free to anything. "},"33":{"title":"Somebody Started Stalking Me Today.

A simple Saturday outing to mine began a long ordeal that I\u2019m still dealing with.\n\nPeanut butter, bread, and deli meat. Those were the last few items on my shopping list.\n\nGetting the meat and bread wasn\u2019t hard. Well, that\u2019s not exactly true, getting the bread was a bit difficult, as I didn\u2019t know which type my girlfriend wanted. I decided to call her and find out.\n\nI called her.\n\n**Me:** Hey, I\u2019m at the bread, uh, \u201carea\u201d? I guess? Anyways, which type do you want? There\u2019s a lot of them?\n\nMy girlfriend, Mari, responded.\n\n**Mari:** Sourdough, is that all?\n\n**Me:** Yup, thanks.\n\nI hung up the phone and grabbed the nicest looking loaf of sourdough bread I could find. It was my day off today and Mari was working, so I was stuck on grocery shopping duty.\n\nI managed to remember that she wanted natural (NATURAL) peanut butter, so I went to that section of the store next.\n\nBoth relief and panic overtook me as I got to the section of the shelf in which the peanut butter lay.\n\nThere was only one jar left. I looked to my left and then my right. Finders keepers.\n\nAs I went to grab the jar, another hand clasped onto mine. I looked at my hand, and then at the person who had touched me.\n\n**Me:** H\u2014hey, I had my hand on this first. You can\u2019t have it.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to be rude to the person who had grabbed my hand, but they did grab my hand, and it WAS the last jar of peanut butter.\n\nThey weren\u2019t responding to me, so I spoke again.\n\n**Me:** C\u2014can you take your hand off the jar now? I\u2019m starting to get uncomfortable. Please\u2026\n\nThe person, who I\u2019ll refer to as The Stranger, spoke for the first time.\n\n**Stranger:** It\u2019s not nice to take things. You should let me have this. I don\u2019t have anything.\n\nI was caught off guard by that. I was so focused on getting the jar that I never ended up actually getting a good look at them.\n\nThey were *tall*. I\u2019d say about 6\u20194. Unkempt, but short hair, scraggly facial hair and dirty clothing. I feel a bit ashamed for this now, but I wondered at that moment if the man could even afford the jar of peanut butter he was fighting for.\n\n**Me:** I\u2019m sorry, I was going for it first. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re going to have a new shipment in soon.\n\nAt that, I wiggled out of his grip and grabbed the jar. I muttered a quick \u201csorry\u201d before scampering away and running to checkout.\n\nLeaving the store, I headed back to the car. Before I got in, I decided to shoot Mari a quick text.\n\n**Me:** Got everything. Still out though, anything else you want or need?\n\n**Mari:** Mm, nothing I can think of right now. If it comes to me, I can prolly just go and get it myself.\n\nI was about to respond when I felt a small pang of pain in my head. It felt as though someone was staring at me. I looked up and found that the feeling wasn\u2019t without reason.\n\nThe Stranger from the store was staring at me. I looked back at him.\n\nRealizing I was still talking to someone, I quickly replied to Mari.\n\n**Me:** Okay. Oh, I wanted to tell you something.\n\n**Mari:** Yeah?\n\n**Me:** There\u2019s some dude staring at me in the parking lot. I\u2019m not scared of him or anything like that, but it\u2019s really weird. He\u2019s just\u2014he\u2019s just standing there, staring at me.\n\n**Mari:** What the hell? That\u2019s super weird. Did you ask him why or?\n\n**Me:** No, I\u2019m just about to get in the car, maybe I ought to drive away and put some distance between us. It\u2019s really weirding me out.\n\n**Mari:** Okay, probably a good idea. Stay safe though, wouldn\u2019t want my boyfriend in danger on his grocery run, ha ha!\n\n**Me:** Okay, gonna drive now. Have a good rest of your shift.\n\nI had the steering wheel in a white knuckled grip. It didn\u2019t bother me. He was just some weird guy at the store. What store *doesn\u2019t* have that? God dammit, I said I wasn\u2019t scared.\n\nI said I wasn\u2019t scared, but I can\u2019t help but feel a forbidding sense of anxiety creeping over me. I feel like this isn\u2019t the last I\u2019m going to see of that man.\n\nI couldn\u2019t make it home soon enough. Getting out of the car and grabbing the groceries, I got into the house at a quicker pace than groceries would justify.\n\nIn the half hour or so that it took me to put the groceries away, the feeling of unease still hadn\u2019t left me. I shut the fridge door and nearly collapsed.\n\nHe was standing in our yard.\n\nBy now, my feeling of anxiety had been replaced by one of anger. I\u2019m not proud of what came out next, but the man was trespassing. I opened up the kitchen window and yelled at him.\n\n**Me:** WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING IN MY YARD?!\n\nHe didn\u2019t respond. He just stared at me with piercing black eyes.\n\n**Me:** I ASKED YOU A QUESTION.\n\nNothing.\n\n**Me:** H\u2014HELLO?!\n\nHe finally took action, only he did so in the form of starting a trek towards me. His steps were slow and deliberate, almost like he knew what he was doing. I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes.\n\n**Me:** G\u2014GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE. I\u2019LL CALL THE POLICE!\n\nHe just stopped, looked into the sky, back down, and continued walking. It was like he didn\u2019t even *hear* me. I rushed to lock the front and back doors so I wouldn\u2019t miss him.\n\nI got back to the kitchen in record time and a bang on the screen was there to greet me. It was him, and he had slapped his palm on the screen protector in the window frame.\n\nI walked up to him cautiously and asked him one question.\n\n**Me:** Why are you doing this?\n\nAnd he said the only words I would ever hear him repeat.\n\n**The Stranger**: I\u2019m doing it because you aren\u2019t a nice person. You aren\u2019t nice.\n\nI was awestruck; was this about the peanut butter? My thoughts became quickly became reality as I replied.\n\n**Me:** I\u2014is this about the peanut butter, man? I can just give you the fuckin\u2019 jar if you want. No need to follow me back to my ho\u2014\n\n*SLAM*.\n\nThe unmistakable sound of the front door closing rang out in my ears. W\u2014was Mari home? I had to see, so I called out.\n\n**Me:** Mari? Is that you?\n\nThe reassuring sound of my girlfriend\u2019s voice rang out through our home.\n\n**Mari:** Yup, who else would it be?\n\n**Me:** if you can believe it, the dude from the st\u2014\n\nAs I looked back to point him out, I saw nothing but an empty back yard.\n\n**Me:** The fuck?\n\nMari came up and stood next to me.\n\n**Mari:** Hm? What were you gonna say?\n\nI steeled myself and turned to her.\n\n**Me:** Hey, I\u2019ll make dinner tonight. We need to talk about something.\n\nShe was a bit confused but agreed.\n\nThat\u2019s all that\u2019s happened for now, I\u2019m going to make dinner and talk to Mari about this\u2014this guy, I guess. I\u2019ll update you guys if anything else about him comes up.\n\nI\u2019m hoping it\u2019s a one off, though. This shit is super fucking weird and I\u2019m getting more and more nervous thinking about it.\n\nI\u2019ll let you know how it goes."},"34":{"title":"People dont believe I had a brother.

She\u2019d come back the afternoon before to confirm what Gertie had told her, and I\u2019d assured her that I really had decided to meet with my parents so long as I could do it before I left the facility and there were some guarantees for my safety.  One of which being that she\u2019d put one of the hospital\u2019s armed security guards right outside the room during our visit.  She\u2019d looked at me thoughtfully for a moment and then agreed.\n\nThe following morning she was looking less sure of herself, and I could tell she was genuinely concerned as she asked me if I still wanted to go through with it.  Smiling at her, I gave a nod. \n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve given it a lot of thought, and I think it\u2019s something I have to do.  Even if the chance is small, I can\u2019t think of another way out of this other than to confront it head on.\u201d\n\nShe returned my smile.  \u201cI understand.  And I think it\u2019s a courageous thing.  I don\u2019t\u2026well, I don\u2019t believe everything you\u2019ve told me.  I think you understand why.  But I do believe that your parents  may have abused you, and if I can help provide a safe space for you to talk to them and get into a better head space, I\u2019m happy to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really appreciate it.  And they aren\u2019t in there, right?  I get to go in first and get settled?\u201d\n\nShe nodded.  \u201cYes, they\u2019re being held in the front waiting room until you\u2019re ready.\u201d  Turning a last corner, she gestured to a door.  \u201cAnd here we are.\u201d  \n\nThere was a large man wearing a black uniform standing next to the door, and at our approach, he gave a smiling nod.  \u201cGood to see you, doctor.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood to see you, Russ.  This is Stephen.  I\u2019m going to get him comfortable and then they can send his parents back.\u201d  She paused and then added.  \u201cRuss, promise to take care of Stephen, okay?  His parents\u2026well, he\u2019s got concerns with them, so stay sharp when they\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nHe glanced at me and back at her, his expression growing more serious.  \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d  Looking back at me, he gave a sharp nod.  \u201cDon\u2019t worry.  I\u2019ve got you covered.\u201d\n\nI met his gaze and returned the nod.  \u201cThank you.  I believe you.\u201d\n\nGoing into the room, I was surprised by how similar it was to the interview rooms deeper within the hospital. The same walls, same table and two chairs, but slid over more to the side to accommodate a small sofa as well.  Seeing everything in its place, I smiled to Dr. Smalls with a confidence I didn\u2019t feel.  My stomach was already twisted in knots, and the idea of what was coming only made it worse.\n\n\u201cOkay, I think I\u2019m ready.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay.  I\u2019ll get them sent back.  Let me know if you need me.\u201d\n\nAs soon as she shut the door, I went to the far chair and slid it against the wall farthest from the door.  Then I began taking off my shirt.\n\n**** \n\nSeeing them walk in was surreal.  They looked like my parents, the people I\u2019d loved and trusted more than anybody, and seeing them come into the room all warm smiles and laughter, I felt a moment of disorientation.  Had all the rest really happened?  Didn\u2019t it have to be a nightmare or some figment of my imagination?  Didn\u2019t me being crazy make the most\u2026\n\nThe last time I saw Mark\u2019s face flashed before my eyes.\n\nNo.  I knew what they were.  It all happened, just like I remembered.  Tears stinging my eyes, I returned their smile, but kept my distance when Mom offered me a hug.  I could see a hardness growing beneath their smiles, but they were careful.  Dad frowned slightly as he gave a confused laugh.\n\n\"Why\u2019s your shirt off, sport?\u201d\n\nI glanced at where I\u2019d hung it on the wall.  \u201cI\u2019m hot.  I\u2019m nervous and that makes me hot.  Hope it won\u2019t bother you.\u201d\n\nThe thing that looked like my father shook his head.  \u201cNo, not at all.  Just wondering.  How come you\u2019re\u2026\u201d  He glanced down at Dr. Smalls who was watching all of this from the doorway.  \u201cAre you going to be staying or can we have some time alone with our son?\u201d\n\nShe looked to me and I stared into her eyes pleadingly.  Please just say yes.  Just yes and nothing more.  Don\u2019t tell them anything else, just leave them alone with me with no one watching.\n\nFrowning slightly, she shook her head.  \u201cNo, he\u2019s going to be released today anyway.  You feel free to to visit in private.  If you need anything\u2026um, just knock on the door.\u201d\n\nThe mother thing thanked her and pulled the door closed behind her.  When she turned back, they both began smiling at me\u2014more genuine, terrible smiles that didn\u2019t look like my parents at all.  It was the father thing that spoke again first.  \n\n\u201cSo what changed your mind?\u201d\n\nI shrugged.  \u201cI just\u2026I figured it out.\u201d  I waved my hand at them, trying not to shake.  \u201cI mean, not what the fuck you are or what you did to our parents, but I know you\u2026erased Mark somehow.  And that you won\u2019t stop coming for me.  You may wait a bit because you\u2019re patient and smart, but you\u2019d keep coming, wouldn\u2019t you?  Even if I like ran away and hid?\u201d\n\nMom snickered.  \u201cYou can\u2019t hide from us, boy.  We can smell you from across the world.  We are connected, you see.  And yes, we would have gotten you eventually, even if you had run.\u201d  She made a strange clucking sound deep in her throat.  \u201cThis way is much better.  You will still suffer, but your choice makes it all more meaningful.\u201d\n\nDad was still studying me.  His face was stony but I could see excitement dancing in his eyes.  \u201cSo you\u2019re just giving in?  Accepting it?\u201d\n\nI nodded.  I had to do this next part just right or I\u2019d tip them off.  \u201cI am.  I don\u2019t see how I can escape it, and I don\u2019t want to live afraid anymore.  I can\u2026I get out this afternoon and um, I can follow you back home then if you want.\u201d\n\nDad started to chuckle, a thin line of drool trailing out of the corner of his mouth.  \u201cNo need for that.\u201d  He reached down and started unbuckling his belt.  \u201cWe can take care of it right here.  When we\u2019re done, they won\u2019t even remember you were ever here.\u201d\n\nMom was already sliding out of her dress, and within a matter of moments they were both naked.  Their skin was already growing waxy and strange, and I shuddered as they began to change.  My father\u2019s head grew wider and longer as the bottom half unfurled into flared mandibles of black gums and rows of grey teeth.  The thing that looked like Mom was growing wispy webs across her greasy skin, and I could already see the toothy void in her middle growing as they both began to approach me with small, almost secretive smiles.\n\n\u201cCome on, son.  Let\u2019s get this done. Get this over.\u201d  That was him.\n\nAnd almost in tandem, her softer voice, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be afraid anymore.  Just a few bites, a bit of suffering, and you won\u2019t be anything.  Time for it to end.\u201d\n\nThey were moving past the table now, one on each side so I couldn\u2019t get to the door.  I was trapped between them, pale and shambling monstrosities so horrible that my mind could barely work when I looked at them.  It was too much, it was all too much, and I was frozen to the spot.\n\nThe father thing chuckled as the mother thing reached out to me.  \u201cTake my hand.  Join your brother, join us, again.\u201d\n\nA surge of anger flared through me as I thought of Mark again.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re both going to fucking die.\u201d\n\nGritting my teeth, I stood up from the chair and slammed my hand into the wall where my shirt hung.  Beneath it, the panic button clicked in audibly and a shrill siren began to wail.  The monsters looked around confusedly, wincing at the noise, even as the door flung open and Russ stepped into view.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2026what the fu\u2026\u201d\n\nHis eyes were everywhere, and I had to scream to get his attention over the siren\u2019s noise and the Hell he was seeing.  \u201cThey\u2019re fucking monsters!  Shoot them or they\u2019ll kill us!\u201d  They were already turning toward him, and I saw him reaching for his gun as I dove between them and began crawling under the table.\n\nGunshots rang out, echoing in the small space and mixing with horrible squeals of pain and rage from above and behind me as I scrabbled out the other side of the table\u2019s legs and made it to the door.  Russ noted me passing by and started to step back.  I think he was going to close the door on them, instinctively knowing he needed to escape even after shooting them repeatedly.  One more step and I think he could have shut the door.  \n\nThen my mother grabbed him and yanked him back in.  \n\nBoth of the creatures were bleeding from several wounds and were clearly hurt and weak, but they weren\u2019t dead, and they were still strong enough to start tearing Russ apart and eating him while he screamed like a caught rabbit.  This wasn\u2019t going to work, they would just finish him and then get me and anyone else that got in their way.  Heart and head pounding, I noticed Russ\u2019 black pistol on the ground a few feet from one of my mother\u2019s spasming legs.  But I couldn\u2019t go back in there.  I just\u2026\n\nOut of the corner of my eye I saw Dr. Smalls coming around the corner in a panic.  I met her eyes and shook my head.  \u201cDon\u2019t.  Don\u2019t come down this way.  Please.\u201d  Then I forced myself forward, closing the door behind me as I bent down to pick up the gun.\n\nBoth of the horrors were half-dazed with the pain and pleasure of eating, but the father thing still looked up with a mouthful of Russ\u2019s thigh as I put the gun to its head and pulled the trigger twice.   I half-expected it to not work, but whether it was the location I hit or something else, his head crumpled wetly before the mass of him slumped over.  The mother thing began to scream then, but I didn\u2019t give her time to run or attack.  Praying there were bullets left, I emptied another three rounds into her head and neck before I heard the hard repeated click of me pulling the trigger on an empty gun.\n\nI collapsed to the floor even as the second monster fell, sobbing and screaming so softly that it seemed to be coming from someone else far away.  I may have kept going like that for some time, if not for the shock of everything changing around me.\n\nWithin a matter of moments, like waking up from a bad dream, I saw reality shift and fold and shuffle away the nightmare scene around me.  The monsters were gone, as were their clothes, the blood, and even Russ\u2019 remains.  Everything looked untouched again other than my shirt on the wall, the chair out of place, and a few somethings scattered across the floor.  \n\nI bent over and picked one of them up.  Shell casings from Russ\u2019 gun.  \n\nI grabbed up the rest of them, and after putting on my shirt and sliding the chair back into place, I stepped outside.  Down the hall a little, Dr. Smalls was sitting in a chair holding her head.  I walked up to her and she jumped a little before offering a weary smile.\n\n\u201cStephen\u2026what\u2019re you doing up here?  You don\u2019t leave until this afternoon\u2026right?\u201d  I could see she was muddled, and I felt a pang of worry.\n\n\u201cYou okay, doctor?\u201d\n\nStanding up slowly, she nodded.  \u201cI just had a sudden headache, a migraine really, but it seems to be fading now.\u201d  She blinked and shook her head.  \u201cBut let me get you back to your room.  I\u2019ll see about getting your paperwork signed and you can head out as soon as the timer runs out this afternoon.\u201d  She gave a small laugh.  \u201cBut don\u2019t try to sneak out early or I\u2019ll have to send R\u2026um\u2026I\u2019ll have to send Ellis or someone after you.\u201d  She winced again slightly.  \u201cSorry, I\u2019m just a bit out of sorts at the moment.  Anyway\u2026I hope you\u2019re feeling better about your\u2026\u201d  When she looked at me this time, her eyes were almost pleading.\n\nSucking in a breath, I nodded and forced a smile.  \u201cDepression.  Yeah, you helped me a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. Just remember that the things that try to bring us down are just passing storms. If we can hold on, a lot of times they fade away. \u201c\n\nI glanced back down the hall towards the interview room.  \u201cSometimes they take a lot before they do.\u201d  I let out a long breath as I turned back to her.  \u201cBut yeah.  I\u2019m still [here.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Verastahl\/) \"\n\n\n"},"35":{"title":"I'm a long-haul trucker. I stopped for a 'lost kid' on a deserted highway in the dead of night. What I saw attached to him, and the question he asked, is why I don't drive anymore.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1khzgll\/im_a_longhaul_trucker_i_stopped_for_a_lost_kid_on\/","flair":null,"author":"gamalfrank","selftext":"\nThis happened a few years back. I was doing long-haul, mostly cross-country routes, the kind that take you through vast stretches of nothing. You know the ones \u2013 where the radio turns to static for hours, and the only sign of life is the occasional pair of headlights going the other way, miles apart. I was young, eager for the miles, the money. Didn\u2019t mind the solitude. Or so I thought.\n\nThe route I was on took me across a long, desolate stretch of highway that ran between the borders of two large governmental territories. I don\u2019t want to say exactly where, but think big, empty spaces, lots of trees, not much else. It was notorious among drivers for being a dead zone \u2013 no signal, no towns for a hundred miles either side, and prone to weird weather. Most guys tried to hit it during daylight, but schedules are schedules. Mine had me crossing it deep in the night.\n\nI remember the feeling. Utter blackness outside the sweep of my headlights. The kind of dark that feels like it\u2019s pressing in on the cab. The only sounds were the drone of the diesel engine, the hiss of the air brakes now and then, and the rhythmic thrum of the tires on asphalt. Hypnotic. Too hypnotic.\n\nI\u2019d been driving for about ten hours, with a short break a few states back. Coffee was wearing off. The dashboard lights were a dull green glow, comforting in a way, but also making the darkness outside seem even more absolute. My eyelids felt like they had lead weights attached. You fight it, you know? Slap your face, roll down the window for a blast of cold air, crank up whatever music you can find that hasn\u2019t dissolved into static. I was doing all of that.\n\nIt must have been around 2 or 3 AM. I was in that weird state where you\u2019re not quite asleep, but not fully awake either. Like your brain is running on low power mode. The white lines on the road were starting to blur together, stretching and warping. Standard fatigue stuff. I remember blinking hard, trying to refocus.\n\nThat\u2019s when I saw it. Or thought I saw it.\n\nJust a flicker at the edge of my headlights, on the right shoulder of the road. Small. Low to the ground. For a split second, I registered a shape, vaguely human-like, and then it was gone, swallowed by the darkness as I passed.\n\nMy first thought? Deer. Or a coyote. Common enough. But it hadn't moved like an animal. It had been upright. My brain, sluggish as it was, tried to process it. Too small for an adult. Too still for an animal startled by a rig.\n\nThen the logical part, the part that was still trying to keep me safe on the road, chimed in: You\u2019re tired. Seeing things. Happens.\n\nAnd I almost accepted that. I really did. Shook my head, took a swig of lukewarm water from the bottle beside me. Kept my eyes glued to the road ahead. The image, though, it kind of stuck. A small, upright shape. Like a child.\n\nNo way, I told myself. Out here? Middle of nowhere? Middle of the night? Impossible. Kids don\u2019t just wander around on inter-territorial highways at 3 AM. It had to be a trick of the light, a bush, my eyes playing games. I\u2019ve seen weirder things born of exhaustion. Shadows that dance, trees that look like figures. It\u2019s part of the job when you\u2019re pushing limits.\n\nI drove on for maybe another thirty seconds, the image fading, my rational mind starting to win. Just a figment.\nThen, I glanced at my passenger-side mirror. Habit. Always checking.\n\nAnd my blood went cold. Not just cold, it felt like it turned to slush.\n\nThere, illuminated faintly by the red glow of my trailer lights receding into the distance, was the reflection of a small figure. Standing. On the shoulder of the road. Exactly where I\u2019d thought I\u2019d seen something.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a bush. It wasn\u2019t a shadow. It was small, and it was definitely standing there, unmoving, as my truck pulled further and further away.\n\nMy heart started hammering against my ribs. This wasn\u2019t fatigue. This was real. There was someone, something, back there. And it looked tiny.\n\nEvery instinct screamed at me. Danger. Wrong. Keep going. But another voice, the one that makes us human, I suppose, whispered something else. A kid? Alone out here? What if they\u2019re hurt? Lost?\n\nI fought with myself for a few seconds that stretched into an eternity. The image in the mirror was getting smaller, fainter. If I didn\u2019t act now, they\u2019d be lost to the darkness again. God, the thought of leaving a child out there, if that\u2019s what it was\u2026\n\nAgainst my better judgment, against that primal urge to just floor it, I made a decision. I slowed the rig, the air brakes hissing like angry snakes. Pulled over to the shoulder, the truck groaning in protest. Put on my hazards, their rhythmic flashing cutting into the oppressive blackness.\n\nThen, I did what you\u2019re never supposed to do with a full trailer on a narrow shoulder. I started to reverse. Slowly. Carefully. My eyes flicking between the mirrors, trying to keep the trailer straight, trying to relocate that tiny figure. The crunch of gravel under the tires sounded unnaturally loud.\n\nIt took a minute, maybe two, but it felt like an hour. The red glow of my tail lights eventually washed over the spot again. And there it was.\n\nA kid.\n\nI stopped the truck so my cab was roughly alongside them, maybe ten feet away. Switched on the high beams, hoping to get a better look, and also to make myself clearly visible as just a truck, not something else.\n\nThe kid was\u2026 small. Really small. I\u2019d guess maybe six, seven years old? Hard to tell in the glare. They were just standing there, on the very edge of the gravel shoulder, right where the trees began. The woods pressed in close on this stretch of road, tall, dark pines and dense undergrowth that looked like a solid black wall just beyond the reach of my lights.\n\nThe kid wasn\u2019t looking at me. They were facing sort of parallel to the road, just\u2026 walking. Slowly. Like they were on a stroll, completely oblivious to the massive eighteen-wheeler that had just pulled up beside them, engine rumbling, lights blazing. They were wearing what looked like pajamas. Thin, light-colored pajamas. In the chill of the night. No coat, no shoes that I could see.\n\nMy mind reeled. This was wrong. So many levels of wrong.\n\nI killed the engine. The sudden silence was almost deafening, amplifying the crickets, the rustle of leaves in the woods from a breeze I couldn\u2019t feel in the cab. My heart was still thumping, a weird mix of fear and adrenaline and a dawning sense of responsibility.\n\nI rolled down the  window. The night air hit me, cold and damp, carrying the scent of pine and wet earth.\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d I called out. My voice sounded hoarse, too loud in the quiet. \u201cHey, kid!\u201d\n\nNo response. They just kept walking, one small, bare foot in front of the other, at a pace that was taking them absolutely nowhere fast. Their head was down, slightly. I couldn\u2019t see their face properly.\n\n\u201cKid! Are you okay?\u201d I tried again, louder this time.\n\nSlowly, so slowly, the kid stopped. They didn\u2019t turn their head fully, just sort of angled it a fraction, enough that I could see a pale sliver of cheek in the spill of my headlights. Still not looking at me. Still ignoring the multi-ton machine idling beside them.\n\nA prickle of unease ran down my spine. Not the normal kind of unease. This was deeper, colder. Animals act weird sometimes, but kids? A lost kid should be scared, relieved, something. This one was\u2026 nothing.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing out here all alone?\u201d I asked, trying to keep my voice calm, friendly. Like you\u2019re supposed to with a scared kid. Even though this one didn\u2019t seem scared at all. \u201cIt\u2019s the middle of the night.\u201d\n\nSilence. Just the sound of their bare feet scuffing softly on the gravel as they took another step, then another. As if my presence was a minor inconvenience, a background noise they were choosing to ignore.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t right. My internal alarm bells were clanging louder now. My hand hovered near the gearstick. Part of me wanted to slam it into drive and get the hell out of there. But the image of this tiny child, alone, possibly in shock\u2026 I couldn\u2019t just leave. Could I?\n\n\u201cWhere are your parents?\u201d I pushed, my voice a bit sharper than I intended. \u201cAre you lost?\u201d\n\nFinally, the kid stopped walking completely. They turned their head, just a little more. Still not looking directly at my cab, more towards the front of my truck, into the glare of the headlights. I could see their face a bit better now. Pale. Featureless in the harsh light, like a porcelain doll. Small, dark smudges that might have been eyes. No expression. None. Not fear, not sadness, not relief. Just\u2026 blank. An unreadable slate.\n\nThen, a voice. Small. Thin. Like the rustle of dry leaves.\n\u201cLost.\u201d\n\nJust that one word. It hung in the air between us.\n\nRelief washed over me, quickly followed by a fresh wave of concern. Okay, lost. That\u2019s something I can deal with. \u201cOkay, kid. Lost is okay. We can fix lost. Where do you live? Where were you going?\u201d\n\nThe kid finally, slowly, turned their head fully towards my cab. Towards me.\nI still couldn\u2019t make out much detail in their face. The angle, the light, something was obscuring it, keeping it in a sort of shadowy vagueness despite the headlights. But I could feel their gaze. It wasn't like a normal kid's look. There was a weight to it, an intensity that was deeply unsettling for such a small form.\n\n\u201cHome,\u201d the kid said, that same thin, reedy voice. \u201cTrying to get home.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight, home. Where is home?\u201d I asked, leaning forward a bit, trying to project reassurance. \u201cIs it near here? Did you wander off from a campsite? A car?\u201d There were no campsites for miles. No broken-down cars on the shoulder. I knew that.\n\nThe kid didn\u2019t answer that question directly. Instead, they took a small step towards the truck. Then another. My hand tensed on the door handle, ready to open it, to offer\u2026 what? A ride? Shelter? I didn\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cold out here,\u201d I said, stating the obvious. \u201cYou should get in. We can get you warm, and I can call for help when we get to a spot with a signal.\u201d My CB was useless, just static. My phone had shown \u2018No Service\u2019 for the last hour.\n\nThe kid stopped about five feet from my passenger door. Still in that pale, thin pajama-like outfit. Barefoot on the sharp gravel. They should be shivering, crying. They were doing neither.\n\n\u201cCan you help me?\u201d the kid asked. The voice was still small, but there was a different inflection to it now. Less flat. A hint of\u2026 something else. Pleading, maybe?\n\n\u201cYeah, of course, I can help you,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I stopped. Where are your parents? How did you get here?\u201d\n\nThe kid tilted their head. A jerky, unnatural little movement. \u201cThey\u2019re waiting. At home.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay\u2026 And where\u2019s home? Which direction?\u201d I gestured vaguely up and down the empty highway.\n\nThe kid didn\u2019t point down the road. They made a small, subtle gesture with their head, a little nod, towards the trees. Towards the impenetrable darkness of the woods lining the highway.\n\n\u201cIn there,\u201d the kid said.\n\nMy stomach clenched. \u201cIn the woods? Your home is in the woods?\u201d\n\n\u201cLost,\u201d the kid repeated, as if that explained everything. \u201cTrying to find the path. It\u2019s dark.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s very dark,\u201d I agreed, my eyes scanning the treeline. It looked like a solid wall of black. No sign of any path, any habitation. Just dense, old-growth forest. The kind of place you could get lost in for days, even in daylight.\n\n\u201cCan you\u2026 come out?\u201d the kid asked. \u201cHelp me look? It\u2019s not far. I just\u2026 I can\u2019t see it from here.\u201d\n\nEvery rational thought in my head screamed NO. Get out of the truck? In the middle of nowhere, in the pitch dark, with this\u2026 strange child, who wanted me to go into those woods? No. Absolutely not.\n\nBut the kid looked so small. So vulnerable. If there was even a tiny chance they were telling the truth, that their house was just a little way in, and they were genuinely lost\u2026\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea, buddy,\u201d I said, trying to sound gentle. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous in there at night. For both of us. Best thing is for you to hop in here with me. We\u2019ll drive until we get a signal, and then we\u2019ll call the police, or the rangers. They can help find your home properly.\u201d\n\nThe kid just stood there. That blank, unreadable face fixed on me.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s right there,\u201d they insisted, their voice a little more insistent now. \u201cJust a little way. I can almost see it. If you just\u2026 step out\u2026 the light from your door would help.\u201d\n\nMy skin was crawling. There was something profoundly wrong with this scenario. The way they were trying to coax me out. The lack of normal emotional response. The pajamas. The bare feet. The woods.\n\nI looked closer at the kid, trying to pierce that strange vagueness around their features. My headlights were bright, but it was like they absorbed the light rather than reflected it. Their eyes\u2026 I still couldn\u2019t really see their eyes. Just dark hollows.\n\n\u201cI really think you should get in the truck,\u201d I said, my voice firmer now. \u201cIt\u2019s warmer in here. We can figure it out together.\u201d\n\nThe kid took another step closer. They were almost at my running board now.\n\u201cPlease?\u201d they said. That reedy voice again. \u201cMy leg hurts. I can\u2019t walk much further. If you could just\u2026 help me a little. Just to the path.\u201d\n\nMy internal conflict was raging. My trucker instincts, honed by years of seeing weird stuff and hearing weirder stories at truck stops, were blaring warnings. But the human part, the part that saw a child in distress, was still there, still arguing.\n\nI was tired. So damn tired. Maybe I wasn\u2019t thinking straight. Maybe this was all some bizarre misunderstanding.\n\nI squinted, trying to see past the kid, towards the treeline they\u2019d indicated. Was there a faint trail I was missing? A flicker of light deep in the woods? No. Nothing. Just blackness. Solid, unyielding blackness.\n\nAnd then I saw it.\nIt wasn\u2019t something I saw clearly at first. It was more like\u2026 an anomaly. A disturbance in the darkness behind the kid.\n\nThe kid was standing with their back mostly to the woods, facing my truck. Behind them, the darkness of the forest was absolute. Or it should have been. But there was something\u2026 connected to them. Something that stretched from the small of their back, from under the thin pajama top, and disappeared into the deeper shadows of the trees.\n\nAt first, I thought it was a trick of the light, a weird shadow cast by my headlights hitting them at an odd angle. Maybe a rope they were dragging? A piece of clothing snagged on a branch?\n\nI leaned forward, trying to get a clearer view. The kid was still talking, their voice a low, persistent murmur. \u201cIt\u2019s not far\u2026 please\u2026 just help me\u2026 I\u2019m so cold\u2026\u201d\n\nBut I wasn\u2019t really listening to the words anymore. I was focused on that\u2026 that thing behind them.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a rope. It wasn\u2019t a shadow.\nIt was\u2026 a tube. A long, dark, thick tube.\nIt seemed to emerge directly from the kid\u2019s lower back, impossibly, seamlessly. It was dark matte, like a strip of the night itself given form, and it snaked away from the child, maybe ten, fifteen feet, before disappearing into the inky blackness between two thick pine trunks. It wasn\u2019t rigid; it seemed to have a slight, almost imperceptible flexibility, like a massive, sluggish umbilical cord made of shadow. It didn\u2019t reflect any light from my headlamps. It just\u2026 absorbed it.\n\nMy breath hitched in my throat. My blood, which had been cold before, now felt like it had frozen solid. This wasn\u2019t just wrong. This was\u2026 impossible. Unnatural.\n\nThe kid was still trying to coax me. \u201cAre you going to help me? It\u2019s just there. You\u2019re so close.\u201d\n\nMy voice, when I finally found it, was barely a whisper. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off that\u2026 appendage.\n\u201cKid\u2026 what\u2026 what is that? Behind you?\u201d\n\nThe kid flinched. Not a big movement, just a tiny, almost imperceptible tightening of their small frame. Their head, which had been tilted pleadingly, straightened. The blankness on their face seemed to\u2026 solidify.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s what?\u201d they asked, their voice suddenly devoid of that pleading tone. It was flat again. Colder.\n\n\u201cThat\u2026 that thing,\u201d I stammered, pointing with a shaking finger. \u201cComing out of your back. Going into the woods. What is that?\u201d\n\nThe kid didn\u2019t turn to look. They didn\u2019t need to. Their gaze, those dark, unseen eyes, bored into me.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d they said. The voice was still small, but it had a new edge to it. A hardness. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing things. You\u2019re tired.\u201d\n\nThey were using my own earlier rationalization against me.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, my voice gaining a tremor of conviction born of sheer terror. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I see it. It\u2019s right there. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s connected to you.\u201d\n\nThe kid was silent for a long moment. The only sound was the thumping of my own heart, so loud I was sure they could hear it. The crickets had stopped. The wind seemed to die down. An unnatural stillness fell over the scene.\n\nThen, the kid\u2019s face began to change.\nIt wasn\u2019t a dramatic, movie-monster transformation. It was far more subtle, and far more terrifying. The blankness didn\u2019t leave, but it\u2026 sharpened. The pale skin seemed to tighten over the bones. The areas where the eyes were, those dark smudges, seemed to deepen, to become more shadowed, more intense. And a flicker of something ancient and utterly alien passed across their features. It wasn't human anger. It was something older, colder, and infinitely more patient, now strained to its limit.\n\nThe air in my cab suddenly felt thick, heavy, hard to breathe.\n\n\u201cJust come out of the truck,\u201d the kid said, and the voice\u2026 oh god, the voice.\nIt wasn\u2019t the small, reedy voice of a child anymore. It was deeper. Resonant. With a strange, grating undertone, like stones grinding together. It was coming from that small frame, but it was impossibly large, impossibly old. It vibrated in my chest.\n\n\u201cCome out. Now.\u201d The command was absolute.\n\nMy hand, which had been hovering near the gearstick, now gripped it like a lifeline. My other hand fumbled for the ignition key, which I\u2019d stupidly left in.\n\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d I choked out, staring at the monstrous thing playing dress-up in a child\u2019s form, at the dark, pulsating tube that was its anchor to the shadows.\n\nThe kid\u2019s head tilted again, that jerky, unnatural movement. The expression on its face \u2013 if you could call it that \u2013 was one of pure, unadulterated annoyance. Contempt. Like I was a particularly stupid insect it had failed to swat.\n\nAnd then it spoke, in that same terrible, resonant, grinding voice. The words it said are burned into my memory, colder than any winter night.\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d it rasped, the sound seeming to scrape the inside of my skull, \u201cthe FUCK are humans smarter now?\u201d\n\nThat was it.\nThat one sentence. The sheer, cosmic frustration in it. The implication of past encounters, of easier prey. The utter alien nature of it.\n\nI didn\u2019t think. I didn\u2019t plan. I reacted.\nPrimal fear, the kind that bypasses all higher brain function, took over.\nMy hand twisted the key. The diesel engine roared back to life, a sudden, violent explosion of sound in the horrifying stillness.\nThe kid, the thing, actually recoiled. A small, jerky step back. The expression \u2013 that awful, tightened, ancient look \u2013 intensified.\n\nI slammed the gearstick into drive. My foot stomped on the accelerator. The truck lurched forward, tires spinning on the gravel for a terrifying second before they bit into the asphalt.\nI didn\u2019t look at it. I couldn\u2019t. I stared straight ahead, my knuckles white on the steering wheel, the whole cab vibrating around me.\n\nThe truck surged forward, gaining speed with agonizing slowness. For a horrible moment, I imagined that tube-thing whipping out, trying to snag the trailer, to pull me back, to drag me into those woods. I imagined that small figure, with its ancient, terrible voice, somehow keeping pace.\n\nI risked a glance in my driver-side mirror.\nIt was standing there. On the shoulder. Unmoving.\nThe headlights of my departing truck cast its small silhouette into sharp relief. And behind it, the dark tube was still visible, a thick, obscene cord snaking back into the endless night of the forest. It didn't seem to be retracting or moving. It just was.\n\nThe thing didn\u2019t pursue. It just stood and watched me go.\nAnd that, somehow, was almost worse. The sheer confidence. The patience. Like it knew there would be others. Or maybe it was just annoyed that this particular attempt had failed.\n\nI drove.\nI don\u2019t know for how long. I just drove. My foot was welded to the floor. The engine screamed. I watched the speedometer needle climb, far past any legal or safe limit for a rig that size, on a road that dark. I didn\u2019t care.\nThe image of that thing, that child-shape with its dark umbilical to the woods, and that voice, that awful, grinding voice asking its horrifying question, was burned onto the inside of my eyelids.\n\nI must have driven for an hour, maybe more, at speeds that should have gotten me killed or arrested, before the adrenaline started to fade, replaced by a bone-deep, shaking exhaustion that was more profound than any fatigue I\u2019d ever known.\nMy hands were trembling so violently I could barely keep the wheel straight. Tears were streaming down my face \u2013 not from sadness, but from sheer, unadulterated terror and relief.\n\nWhen the first hint of dawn started to grey the eastern sky, and my phone finally beeped, indicating a single bar of service, I pulled over at the first wide spot I could find. I practically fell out of the cab, vomiting onto the gravel until there was nothing left but dry heaves.\nI sat there on the cold ground, shaking, for a long time, watching the sun come up, trying to convince myself that it had been a dream, a hallucination brought on by exhaustion.\n\nBut I knew it wasn\u2019t. The detail of that tube. The voice. The question. You don\u2019t hallucinate something that specific, that coherent, that utterly alien.\n\nI never reported it. Who would I report it to? What would I say? \"Officer, I saw a little kid who was actually an ancient cosmic horror tethered to the woods by a nightmare umbilical cord, and it got mad because I didn't want to be its dinner?\" They\u2019d have locked me up. Breathalyzed me, drug tested me, sent me for a psych eval.\n\nI finished that run on autopilot. Dropped the load. Drove my rig back to the yard. And I quit.\nI told them I was burned out, needed a break. They tried to convince me to stay, offered me different routes, more pay. I just couldn\u2019t. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that kid, that tube, those woods. Every dark road felt like a trap.\n\nI found a local job, something that keeps me home at night. I don\u2019t drive in remote areas anymore if I can help it. Especially not at night. I still have nightmares. Sometimes, when I\u2019m very tired, driving home late from somewhere, I\u2019ll see a flicker at the edge of my vision, on the side of the road, and my heart will try to beat its way out of my chest.\n\nI don\u2019t know what that thing was. An alien? A demon? Something else, something that doesn\u2019t fit into our neat little categories? All I know is that it\u2019s out there. And it\u2019s patient. And it seems to have learned that its old tricks aren't as effective as they used to be.\n\n\"Why the fuck are humans smarter now?\"\n\nThat question haunts me. It implies they weren\u2019t always. It implies that, once upon a time, we were easier. That maybe, just maybe, people like me, tired and alone on dark roads, used to just step out of the cab when asked.\nAnd were never seen again.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re ever driving one of those long, lonely stretches of road, deep in the night, and you see something you can\u2019t explain\u2026 Maybe just keep driving. Maybe being \u201csmarter now\u201d means knowing when not to stop. Knowing when to ignore that little voice telling you to help, because what\u2019s asking for help might not be what it seems.\n\nStay safe out there. And for God\u2019s sake, stay on the well-lit roads."},"36":{"title":"The House Where the Road Ends","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kiicui\/the_house_where_the_road_ends\/","flair":null,"author":"UnlikeBlood","selftext":"Growing up, I was always told to stay away from the house where the road ends. It was an odd thing to see, really\u2014just a single, weather-beaten home sitting alone, like the road itself existed only to lead to it.\u00a0\n\nBack then, every kid in town had a story about it. Some said there was a monster in the attic. Others swore the floorboards would swallow you whole if you stepped on the porch. One girl claimed she heard someone humming inside\u2014soft and slow\u2014like a lullaby. But there was one rule we all knew, no matter what version of the story you believed:\n\n**Never knock.**\n\nMy parents were firm: \u201c*Don\u2019t you ever go near it!\u201d*\n\nThey never explained why, just promised I\u2019d be grounded for a month, lose my bike, my barbies\u2014everything\u2014if I even stepped onto the property.\u00a0\n\nSo I listened. Even when the neighborhood\u2019s most popular kids dared me to go with them, I stayed behind. I kept my head down and obeyed.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a good thing I did.\n\nBecause that was the last time anyone saw them.\n\nNow, at 28 years old, I\u2019ve ended up right where I was told never to go\u2014standing in front of the house where the road ends.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t supposed to come to this. I had a career. A marriage. A future. But everything fell apart after the miscarriage. The grief swallowed me, and I couldn\u2019t keep up\u2014not with my husband, not with my job. I lost both. And for a while, I lost myself too.\n\nNow I\u2019m back in my hometown, staying in my old room at my parents\u2019 place, pretending I\u2019m just taking time to \u201cget back on my feet.\u201d But I know why I\u2019m really here.\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about this house my entire life.\n\nI used to tell myself I felt guilty for not going with the kids when they invited me all those years ago. That I owed it to them. But deep down, I know that\u2019s not it. My curiosity didn\u2019t fade with time\u2014it bloomed. Quietly. Obsessively. Like something waiting for the right season to grow.\n\nI parked off to the side of the overgrown road, my tires crunching the gravel. Even now, standing outside it, the house astonished me. It looked *exactly* the same as it had when I was a kid. Weather-worn. Sagging porch. Shingles peeling like dead skin. The years had passed, but it hadn\u2019t aged a day.\u00a0\n\nNeither had my unease.\n\nAs I walked up the creaking steps something about the place felt familiar. Sure I\u2019ve seen the house while growing up but being on the property felt like I\u2019ve been here before.\u00a0\n\nI barely raised my hand to knock when the door eased open with a soft groan. Standing in the doorway was a man who looked like he might be in his late forties\u2014maybe early fifties\u2014but something about him was off. His skin was unnaturally smooth, wrinkle-free, like someone had ironed it. Not a single freckle or pore. No stubble on his face. No body hair at all. Just polished, preserved skin stretched across sharp cheekbones.\n\nHe was tall, with broad shoulders, but somehow still looked small in his beige button-up cardigan and denim jeans\u2014like he was trying to look normal and just missed the mark.\n\n\u201cGood morning, sweetheart,\u201d he said, his tone syrupy and calm. \u201cWelcome to my humble abode.\u201d\n\nA chill rolled up my spine. Not because of the words\u2014but the way he said them. Soft. Low. Almost as if he was talking to a child.\n\nHe invited me inside with that same soft, measured smile.\n\nThe first thing that hit me wasn\u2019t the silence\u2014it was the smell.\n\nIt didn\u2019t stink like rot or mildew. No, it was worse than that. It smelled humid, fleshy\u2014like sweat pressed into fabric, like skin that had been too warm for too long. There was an artificial sweetness layered over it, something chemical and perfumed, like off-brand baby powder mixed with Febreze. A failed attempt to mask something organic.\u00a0\n\nDespite the smell, the house was spotless. Sterile. Everything arranged just so, like a showroom no one had ever touched. The living room looked like it had been staged from an old catalog\u2014clean lines, soft whites, not a speck of dust. It felt less like a home and more like someone\u2019s idea of what a home should look like.\n\nJust inside the door, on the little key table beneath a brass lamp, were a few neatly framed drawings. Crayon on construction paper.\u00a0\n\nChildren\u2019s art.\u00a0\n\nThe kind you'd expect to see stuck to a fridge with magnets. But these were framed. Centered. Carefully preserved like they mattered more than they should\u2019ve.\n\nOne of them caught my eye.\n\nIt showed two stick figures\u2014one small, one tall. The smaller one had pigtails and a pink triangle dress. The larger one was filled in completely black, like the crayon had been pressed hard enough to tear the paper in places. They were holding hands.\n\nAt the top, written in shaky block letters, it said:\n\n**Me + VV**\n\nAt the bottom corner, scrawled in red, were the initials:\u00a0\n\n**R. E.**\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he said, gesturing to the couch. \u201cMake yourself comfortable.\u201d\u00a0\n\nI sat stiffly on the couch, unsure where to put my hands. The cushion felt unused, too firm. Across from me, Mr. Wrenley lowered himself into the rocking chair with a practiced ease, folding one leg over the other. The chair creaked once, then went silent.\n\n\u201cI insist on knowing your name, darling.\u201d The word landed wrong in my ears. I immediately felt nauseous.\n\n\u201cAmika,\u201d I said bluntly.\n\n\u201cAh\u2026 Amika.\u201d He rolled my name on his tongue like he was tasting it. \u201cAmika\u2026 Amika\u2026 hmm.\u201d He said it again, slower this time, almost like he was trying to memorize how it felt in his mouth. \u201cWhat a beautiful name,\u201d he said finally, smiling again.\n\nI clenched my teeth.\n\n\u201cWell, Amika, you may call me Mr. Wrenley.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2026 nice to meet you, Wrenley,\u201d I replied.\n\nHis smile tightened.\u00a0\n\n\u201c*Mr.* Wrenley,\u201d he corrected sharply. The sudden firmness in his tone hit me like a slap. My chest tensed. The shift was small. Barely anything. But every alarm in my body went off.\n\n\u201cWould you like some tea?\u201d he asked pleasantly, like we were two old friends catching up. \u201cChamomile, maybe? With a little honey? That\u2019s what your mother used to drink. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nI blinked. \u201cI\u2014I\u2019m okay, thank you.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, not offended. Just watching. His eyes moved too slowly, like he was trying to read something behind my face.\n\n\u201cI must say, Amika\u2026 you\u2019ve grown into something lovely.\u201d The words came sugar-dipped, but I felt the bitterness beneath. It didn\u2019t sound like a compliment. It sounded like a report.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I muttered. I glanced around the room again, trying to ease the pressure in my chest. Everything was too clean. Every object had been placed with careful intention\u2014but no warmth.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve lived here long?\u201d I asked, just to fill the silence.\n\nHe smiled softly. \u201cAlways.\u201d He tapped the arm of his chair with two fingers, like it amused him. I looked at the framed drawings by the door. I let my eyes drift to the framed crayon drawings by the door again. \u201cThey\u2019re\u2026 sweet,\u201d I said, unsure why the word felt so wrong. Mr. Wrenley glanced at them, then back at me. \u201cChildren like to draw what makes them feel safe.\u201d\n\nI nodded slowly. \u201cDid someone live here before?\u201d He didn\u2019t answer right away. Just smiled like he\u2019d heard a funny joke only he understood. \u201cVisitors come and go,\u201d he said. \u201cThe house has always been\u2026 welcoming.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou keep their art?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, like it was obvious. \u201cChildren leave things behind.\u201d\n\nI shifted in my seat. \u201cThat one,\u201d I said, gesturing vaguely. \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s been here a long time.\u201d I asked. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, with a small nod. \u201cSome things stay longer than others.\u201d He looked at me with eyes that felt older than the house itself. There was a pause. A little too long. I tried to smile. \u201cWell\u2026 it\u2019s a nice place. Cozy.\u201d He chuckled softly. \u201cIt grows on you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d he said after a moment, \u201cI can help you with your little issue.\u201d\n\nI felt the back of my neck prickle.\n\nI froze. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nHe tilted his head, eyes almost kind. \u201cThe ache. The loss. That sense that something is missing. Call it what you like.\u201d The room felt colder somehow, even as the air thickened around me. \u201cGrief makes you heavy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut some homes are built to bear the weight.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\nHis smile didn\u2019t falter.\n\n\u201cOf course you do.\u201d\n\nWe sat in silence for a long beat. Then he looked toward the stairs.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s awake now,\u201d he said softly. \u201cShe knows you\u2019re here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\nHe stood slowly, like this was part of a ritual. One he\u2019d performed before.\n\n\u201cGo take a look upstairs.\u201d He straightened his cardigan, smoothing a wrinkle that wasn\u2019t there.\u00a0\n\n\u201c*She\u2019s waiting for you.*\u201d\n\nA chill swept over me.\n\nI stood on shaky legs, every instinct screaming not to move, not to listen. But I stepped toward the stairs anyway. The air shifted. Thicker. Warmer.\n\nEach step groaned under my weight like it hated me.\n\nHalfway up, I looked back. Mr. Wrenley was still watching. Still smiling.\n\nAt the top of the stairs, the smell hit me.\n\nRot. Sweetness. Sweat. Decay. The same scent I noticed downstairs\u2014only now it was stronger, concentrated. Alive.\n\nA narrow hallway stretched ahead, faded carpet underfoot, walls a sickly beige. Doors lined either side, all shut\u2014except one.\n\nAt the very end just barely ajar.\n\nThe silence pressed in harder with every step I took toward it. The carpet crunched beneath my shoes like old cereal. My throat burned from holding back the urge to gag.\n\nThe closer I got, the more I realized\u2014this wasn\u2019t a dead smell. It was something still rotting while it breathed.\n\nI reached the door. Paused. My hand hovered over it.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to know. But I had to.\n\nI pushed it open.\n\nThe hinges gave a long, aching creak. The stench exploded in my face. I yanked my jacket up over my nose, but it didn\u2019t help. The air felt thick, wet, like breathing through a sponge soaked in spoiled milk.\n\nInside the room, the light was dim\u2014just a single lamp humming in the corner.\n\nAnd on the bed\u2026 something was waiting.\n\nIt was thin\u2014impossibly thin. Its limbs looked like they\u2019d been stretched, starved, dried out. Translucent skin clung to a skeleton that didn\u2019t seem human. Greasy brown hair hung in limp strands across a bloated stomach so swollen it looked ready to split.\n\nIts belly rose unnaturally high, the flesh pulled taut, pale and pulsing, like something was pushing outward from inside. The belly button jutted like a cracked, puckered eye. Dark blue veins spiderwebbed across its stomach. Beneath the skin, shapes shifted. I couldn\u2019t tell how many. I stared at its swollen stomach, and something in me twisted\u2014something I didn\u2019t want to name. It was wrong. All of it was wrong. And still\u2026 it had what I lost.\n\nUmbilical cords spilled down over the footboard. One curled onto the floor in a slow, twitching loop.\n\nIt raised one bony arm, the joints popping. Its fingers were long, curved like insect legs, nails yellow and curled outward.\u00a0\n\nIt spoke.\n\n\u201cMy child\u2026 I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d\n\nIts voice was soft. Feminine. Almost motherly. But not right. Like a nursery rhyme played backward.\n\nIt beckoned.\n\nI stumbled back, heart jackhammering in my chest\u2014right into something solid. A hand gripped my shoulder. Another curled into my hair. Mr. Wrenley leaned in, his breath hot against my ear.\n\n\u201cYou smell wonderful, Miss Amika,\u201d he whispered. \u201cSo full of potential.\u201d\n\nThat broke me.\n\nI shoved him off and bolted. Down the stairs, through the door, off the porch\u2014\n\nI didn\u2019t stop until I hit the dirt and collapsed to my knees, vomiting into the dry earth.\n\nI raced back to my parents\u2019 house, heart slamming in my chest the entire drive. Gravel crunched under the tires as I pulled up. I barely remembered turning off the engine before I was through the front door, slamming it shut behind me.\n\nDad was in his recliner with a beer in hand, half-watching some game on TV. Mom was in the kitchen, humming softly as she chopped vegetables. Like it was just another evening.\n\n\u201cDid you know?\u201d I asked, my voice sharp, breath catching. \u201cDid you know what\u2019s in that fucking house?!\u201d Dad grunted, annoyed, not even looking up. Mom stepped out from the kitchen, holding a knife in one hand, a carrot in the other. \u201cWhat are you talking about, sweetheart?\u201d she asked carefully.\n\n\u201cYou know exactly what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d I could barely keep the disgust out of my voice. She stood still, eyes dull with dread. The knife dropped into the sink with a metallic clatter. Dad finally looked over. Then went back to his beer.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 you saw it?\u201d Mom whispered. \u201cIs that why you never let me near that place?\u201d I snapped. \u201cBecause you knew?\u201d Mom didn\u2019t answer. She just gestured toward the dining table. \u201cHoney, come sit down.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarie\u2026\u201d my dad said without turning. The warning in his voice was subtle, but it was there. \u201cI\u2019m telling her,\u201d Mom said, firm but quiet. \u201cMarie! You know the rule!\u201d Dad snapped, standing now. His face was flushed, jaw clenched. \u201cShe\u2019s already seen it! It\u2019s too late now,\u201d she snapped, then turned back to me. \u201cSit down sweetie.\u201d\n\nDad hesitated\u2026 then sat. He was still a drunk. But at least he\u2019s a reasonable one, for now. I lowered myself into the chair across from her, still shaking. \u201cWhat rule is he talking about?\u201d She hesitated, fingers trembling against the edge of the table. Her voice came out soft and brittle.\n\n\u201cMr. Vardy\u2026 is a very nice man.\u201d\n\nI stared at her. \u201cWho?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cMr. Wrenley,\u201d she corrected herself. \u201cHe calls himself Wrenley now. But that\u2019s not his real name.\u201d She reached out for my hand but I pulled away. Something in her expression shifted\u2014shame. Like she'd been carrying this too long.\n\n\u201cOur town\u2026 it\u2019s special, in ways I wish it weren\u2019t.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d I asked. \u201cWe all\u2026 came from\u2026\u201d She paused. I didn\u2019t need her to finish. I already knew. My voice cracked when I asked, \u201cHow does it\u2026 get pregnant?\u201d\n\nThe air went still. Even the TV had gone quiet. Dad turned toward her slowly. \u201cMarie,\u201d he said. Just her name\u2014but the threat in it was unmistakable. She didn\u2019t break eye contact with me. With a voice so soft, she said:\n\n\u201cMr. Vardy.\u201d\n\nThe silence was heavier than anything I\u2019d seen inside that house.\n\n\u201cThe women here\u2026 we can\u2019t carry children. It\u2019s not in us.\u201d\n\nI swallowed. My throat burned. \u201cIs that why I\u2026?\u201d I didn\u2019t finish the question. She nodded, eyes down. *So I was never broken. I was built this way*.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAll the children here,\u201d she said, \u201cthey were given to us by *him*.\u201d A wave of nausea rolled through me. My hands were slick with sweat.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a rule,\u201d she continued. \u201cOnce adopted, we weren\u2019t allowed to tell you. Not a word. And you were never, *never* to go near that house.\u201d She paused. Her voice dropped further. \u201cIf he finds out\u2026 he punishes the family.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat kind of punishment?\u201d I asked, barely managing the words. Her lips tightened. She stared into her lap.\n\n\u201cThere was a family on Rosewood. The Elkins. Their little girl, Ruthie, went up to the house. One night, they woke up and she was gone. No broken windows. No footprints. Just her bed, still warm. And a note on her pillow.\u201d\n\nHer hand was shaking.\n\n\u201cIt said: *You broke the rules. You can have her back when she forgets.*\u201d\n\nMy mouth went dry. \u201cJesus\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThey waited seven years,\u201d she said. \u201cThen one morning, she was there. Sitting on the porch. Same age. Same dress. Same pigtails.\u201d\u00a0\n\nShe exhaled. \u201cThey ran to her. Tried to hug her. But she pulled away and asked, \u2018Are you my new mommy and daddy?\u2019\u201d My stomach dropped. \u201cShe didn\u2019t remember them?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo, but she did remember *someone*,\u201d my mother said. \u201cShe said she had a friend. A nice one. Said his name was Vee-Vee.\u201d\n\nA thick silence settled in. I sat there taking everything in when\u2014\n\n**Knock. Knock. Knock.**\n\nMy mother jolted. My father froze mid-breath. He stood slowly and walked to the door like a man on his way to the gallows. When he opened it, the color drained from his face.\n\n\u201cWho the hell\u2014\u201d\n\nHe stopped. Dead quiet. Standing in the doorway, smiling politely, was Mr. Wrenley. That same spotless suit. That same gentle smile. But the smile didn\u2019t reach his eyes.\n\nWithout a word, he stepped inside and walked to the dining table. His hands came to rest lightly on my shoulders. I flinched. Dad joined us, suddenly sober. \u201cWhat can we do for you, Mr. Vardy?\u201d Wrenley didn\u2019t answer right away. He just looked between us.\n\nFinally, he spoke\u2014calm, pleasant, like this was just a visit between old friends. \u201cYou all know why I\u2019m here,\u201d he said, smiling wider:\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 let\u2019s have a little chat.\u201d\n"},"37":{"title":"He wears my voice.

Either way they\u2019re never pleasant, and it\u2019s very draining. \n\nI went back to sit down amid the mess in the living room.  I looked at all the papers scattered about and the broken glass from my new wine cups laying near my coffee table. Red stains covering my new carpet. \n\n\u201cGreat. more work. I\u2019ll have to get this cleaned up quick.\u201d I thought to myself. \n\nCindy would be home in less than an hour. Ever since her mom left us I\u2019ve tried my very best to give her a normal life, something I never had. And it gets increasingly harder when things like this happen. \n\nAn hour later Cindy got home, she walked in cheerfully. \u201cHey dad\u201d she quipped as she threw her bag on the couch and slouched down. \u201c hey sweetie, how was your day\u201d I asked trying to seem normal. \n\n\u201cIt was okay, but like soooo boring. I can\u2019t stand this new teacher. He\u2019s like a goof fr.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat new teacher?\u201d I inquired\n\n\u201cMr Johnson, he\u2019s replacing Ms Steven\u2019s our math teacher.\u201d She said\n\n\u201cWhat happened to her? \u201c\n\n\u201cIdk, quit probably. She was really going through it with the divorce and all\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s rough baby\u2014what do you want for dinner? \u201c I asked straying the conversation away from soemthing heavy. \n\n\u201cChicken Alfredooooooo\u201d she sang out with a grin. \n\n\u201cOf course baby\u201d  \nI walked into the kitchen and started cooking. We had a peaceful dinner and went to bed without a hitch. \n\nThe next morning before I could get ready for work I got a call from my uncle. \n\n\u201cDaniel you need to get over here right now.\u201d \n\u201cWhat happe-\u201c\n\n\u201cNOW. You need to come NOW\u201d his voice cracked like something inside him had already broken.\n\nHe hung up and I rushed to my car to drive over since he only lived 3 minutes away. I didn\u2019t know what to expect, but not this. definitely not this. \n\nUncle Joe\u2019s front door was cracked open when I arrived. \n\nI pushed it wide and stepped into chaos. Furniture overturned, a lamp shattered on the floor. Glass smothering the middle of the living room. There was blood\u2014just a little\u2014on the tile. A thin red smear on the wall. \n\n\u201cJoe?\u201d I called out.\n\nA grunt answered from the back room.\n\nI found him slumped in his recliner, pale, holding a dish towel to his side. Blood soaked through it.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d I rushed to him.\n\n\u201cYour damn brother,\u201d he wheezed, half-laughing, half-wincing. \u201cCame in screaming, tore up the place. I tried to calm him down. He shoved me. I lost my balance and fell into the glass table.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d My fists clenched before I could stop them.\n\nJoe motioned toward the garage. \u201cOut there. Said he needed air. Or to scream. One of the two.\u201d\n\nI made it halfway across the living room when I heard the garage door creak open.\n\nAngel stepped in, shirtless, breathing hard, sweat glistening off his face. His pupils were blown wide.\n\n\u201cDanny,\u201d he smiled. \u201cMan, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d come.\u201d He said as if he were greeting me at a bar. \n\n\u201cYou hurt Joe.\u201d I shouted\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s tougher than he looks. You\u2019re mad, I get it. But this\u2014this ain\u2019t all my fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always say that.\u201d My eyes beaming through him. \n\nHe paced a bit, ran a hand through his hair. \u201cYou know what\u2019s crazy? I came here trying to get clean again. I thought maybe I could fix things. But then he started preaching at me. Talking about Cindy  and Jeffie like they\u2019re some sort of angels. She\u2019s not. He\u2019s not. None of us are.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare bring up my daughter.\u201d \n\n\u201cI was just saying,\u201d Angel shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s gonna find out what the world\u2019s really like someday. I mean, you did. Remember what dad used to do when you cried? You remember, right?\u201d\n\nMy stomach dropped.\n\nAngel stepped closer. \u201cI always figured you buried it. But I didn\u2019t. I remembered everything. I just\u2026 handled it differently.\u201d His breath stank of liquor and sin. \n\nI stared at him. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat neighbor\u2019s kid when I was thirteen\u2014Peter?\u201d His voice was calm now, but slightly slurred. \u201cI did to him what dad did to me. Only once. I swear. But\u2026 it felt like balance. You know? Like I got to put it somewhere. Like it wasn\u2019t just us anymore.\u201d \n\nThe room turned to static.\n\n\u201cI always thought maybe you\u2019d get it one day. That you\u2019d break, like me. Then maybe we\u2019d finally be brothers again.\u201d He said unnervingly \n\nI took a step forward. He didn\u2019t move.\n\n\u201cI should\u2019ve left you in that bathroom years ago,\u201d I said through gritted teeth.\n\nThen from behind us: a cough, a weak gasp.\n\nWe turned. Uncle Joe was leaning forward in the recliner, clutching his chest, eyes wide in panic.\n\n\u201cJoe?\u201d I rushed over, dropped to my knees. \u201cUnc? Hey. Look at me.\u201d\n\nHe opened his mouth but no sound came out. His lips were blue.\n\nAngel stood behind me, frozen. \u201cHe was just talking ten minutes ago\u2026\u201d he croaked softly\n\nI felt for a pulse. Nothing.\n\n\u201cCall 911!\u201d I snapped.\n\nBut I already knew. His skin was cooling. His eyes were glassy.\n\nHe was gone.\n\nAnd the moment my brain accepted it, the voice came back.\nClearer this time. Not like a thought.\n\nMore like\u2026 a soft whisper in my ear.\n\n\u201cI knew it , I knew it , I knew it. I should just get rid of him. Good for nothing trash. You deserve to suffer. You deserve what dad did to you.  Everywhere you go you ruin everything. You\u2019re poison. Unclean filth. I can\u2019t stand you. I hate you. I hate you so much. You remind me of dad. You deserve what I\u2019m going\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cDo you want to follow the ambulance to the hospital sir? \u201c  an Officer asked me as I stood by in a trance watching EMT load my uncle\u2019s body bag. \n\n\u201cI..uh yes.\u201d I replied \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about your loss son. You could probably use these.\u201d The officer said warmly as he handed me a pamphlet full of resources to help with the passing of a loved one. \n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d I said emptily. Crumpling the pamphlet. \n\n\nThe next few days were chaotic and melancholic all the same. Angel ran before the cops came, but they caught him the next day. They brought him in for questioning and then let him go from inconclusive evidence. Go figure, this is what passes as justice these days. I had to take over the arrangements for the funeral and informing the rest of the family about it. The funeral came and went as if it was just another day for everyone. I tried to stay grounded as my thoughts were running a thousand miles a minute. Cindy was what kept me from going insane. Her cute reassuring smile could disarm a crazed gunman. \n\nA week went by before I saw Angel again. By that time I sent Cindy to stay with her cousins for a while to get her mind off things. And I had already filed a restraining order against Angel. \n\nHe looked at me with eyes that hadn\u2019t seen sleep as he littered my doorway. \u201cCan you buy me a -\u201c\nI shut the door in his face. I wasn\u2019t in the mood for his bs. I felt his shadow lingering for over an hour after that. Even when I went back out to make sure he was gone. I still felt like he was here. After the second time I looked around I let that feeling dissolve and went on about my day. \n\nMy therapist suggested I try meditation to help deal with the stress. I laid out a mat and sat down and started to meditate. I figured I\u2019d try counting first to keep a steady focus. \n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n1\nWhat should I make for dinner? \n2 \n3\nMaybe some steak\n4\n\n1\nWhy do I feel like angel is still here? \nNah he left I made sure to check. \nI\u2019ll check again after this.\n2\n3\nDad\n4\n\n1\n2\nWhat?\n3 \n4\n\nWhat about dad? \n1\n2\nDon\u2019t cry you sissy \n\u2026\u2026\nIf you keep crying I\u2019ll give you something to cry about \n3\n4\n\u2026..\n\n\u2026.\n1\nWhy ? Why did he? \nDaddy loves it when you cry\nCry harder \nCRY HARDER \nCRY \n      CRY\n          CRY\n    CRY \n         CRY\n  CRY CRY \nCRY CRY CRY CRY CRY \n2\n3\n4\n\nI felt a stream of tears roll down my right eye. \n\nI kept my eyes closed and kept counting \n\n1\nCindy \n2\n3\nYou\u2019re a disgusting disappointment Danny \nYour mother never loved you\nI never loved you\nNo one will ever love you\n4\n\n1\n2\nStop.\nPlease stop it.\n3\n4\n\nWhy would Anyone love you\nYou\u2019re just like him\n1\nHehehehehehe\n2\nWhat is th\u2014\n\nA long drawn out scratch at my living room window interrupted me. \nI wiped my eye as I glanced at it. Then I noticed my hand. Black liquid. All over my face.\n\n \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d \n\nI rushed to my bathroom and Washed it all off. It looked like a bit of it got into my right eye, I might have to go to the doctor. I leaned down to rinse my eye. When I got back up, I froze.\n\nMy reflection was grinning\u2014I wasn\u2019t . \nI checked my face with my hand. I definitely wasn\u2019t. And my reflection hadn\u2019t moved an inch. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong Danny ? \u201c\nMy reflection whispered, its eyes grew completely black and void. \n\nI just stared. Unable to move. Unable to speak and my lungs screaming. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time Danny, you\u2019ve waited too long\nWe\u2019ve waited too long.\nDo it. \nDo it Danny . \u201c\n\nhe raised a long jagged blade and his grin grew more wicked. \n\nThud. \n\nI opened my eyes. I was still in the living room. I got up quickly. I dropped the knife in my hand. \n\nThud. Thud. Thud. \n\nI went to the door. Angel, once again. \nBefore the door was fully open he began. \u201c hey man I really need help this time. I\u2019ll go clean I promise.\u201d Words I\u2019ve heard one too many times before. \n\n\u201cDo it Danny.\nDo it \n    Do\n  It\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease Daniel, I promise for real this time.\u201d Angel pleaded to deaf ears. \n\n\n\u201cLiar \u201c\n\u201cDancing with me\u201d\n\nSo lost in thought I tuned Angel out. \nI smiled and said \u201calright man come on in.\u201d \n\nAngel walked in. My grin widened. \n\n\u201cHe deserves it. You know. We know it. \nYou\u2019d be doing him a favor . He can\u2019t live with himself. He\u2019s weak. Too weak. \u201c\n\nNot even 5 minutes went by and Angel was snoring on the couch. \nPassed out from whatever drugs he was on. \n\n\u201cLook at him. Pathetic. \u201c\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll never amount to anything. All he does is bring you trouble. Pain, and sorrow. That\u2019s all he\u2019s good for. \u201c\n\nI gripped the handle tight. I felt it pulsing, like it had a heartbeat of its own. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a burden. A parasite . A roach\u201d\n\nMy thoughts growing louder and louder in my head. Screaming. Begging to escape. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s his fault Danny. It\u2019s all his fault. \nHis fault Danny \nAll his fault.\u201d\n\nThe thoughts weren\u2019t just in my head anymore. They were all around me. Inside the walls. Echoing in the vents. \n\n\u201cAll his fault\u201d\n\u201cAll his fault\u201d\n\u201cALL MY FAULT DANNY\u201d\nAngel shrieked suddenly. Sitting bolt upright, his eyes as black as void. \n\nThe knife was stuck too deep by the time I realized what I was doing. \n\nAngel started laughing. Wet and guttural. Like the sound came from his stomach. \n\u201cHehehehehe\u2026.\nIm so proud of you Danny.\u201d\n \nIt wasn\u2019t my brother\u2019s voice anymore. Angel sounded like the voice in my head. The voice that\u2019s haunted my thoughts and taken me to darkest corners of humanity. It was its voice. \n\n\nHis mouth kept moving but the voice was booming from every direction. \n\n\u201cDannyy\u201d\n\u201cNow I\u2019m free\u2014from you\u201c\n\nI stumbled back, crashing onto the cold hard floor, breath ragged. I was shirtless. \n\nAngel stood. Grinding his teeth. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you soon\u201d\n\nand then sprinted straight through a window with inhuman speed. \n\nGlass exploded outward\u2014but I didn\u2019t hear it. \n\nHalf a second later every mirror and window in the house shattered . They cracked like bones all at once. \n\nThe whispers left my head that day, but the wind didn\u2019t carry them far.

I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s trauma or something worse. Please just read.\n\nWhat I\u2019m about to tell you changed my life. On paper, it made me clinically insane. I\u2019ve accepted that this is my reality now. I go through the motions, but I can never forget how things used to be. I miss the way it was before we fell.\n\nIt\u2019s not the fall that scares me. It\u2019s that no one else remembers it happened\u2014and that I\u2019m no longer the person I was before it did.\n\nTen years ago, I worked as an assistant for a famous singer from my home country. I won't say her real name or where we're from. Let's call her Simona. My job was to accompany her on tour, make sure she had everything she needed, answer important calls and texts\u2014you know, the usual assistant stuff.\n\nIn June 2015, Simona went on one of her biggest tours ever. We traveled across the country, from the biggest cities to the tiniest towns. Everyone wanted to see her, everyone knew her songs, and every radio station played her music. Simona was on top of the world, and I got to be part of that.\n\nUsually, we traveled by bus. Our country isn\u2019t that big, so it worked fine. But for the final concert, there wasn\u2019t enough time and the distance was too far. So the manager arranged for a private jet to save us a whole day.\n\nI\u2019ve never been afraid of flying. I didn\u2019t grow up flying, since I come from a poor family, so every flight felt special to me. I know a lot of people fear flying because they hate the lack of control. But for me, that was the comfort\u2014I didn\u2019t have to think. I didn\u2019t have to do anything. I had no control, and that was a relief.\n\nThis flight was supposed to be no more than two hours. It had been a stressful summer, and my sleep schedule was wrecked. I barely got three hours of sleep each night. So I was really looking forward to resting in the air, maybe even sleeping the entire flight.\n\nEverything was fine. Peaceful. I felt calm.\n\nUntil I stepped onto the plane.\n\nI\u2019m not afraid of flying. Not at all. But something about this flight felt wrong. The moment I stepped inside, my heart started pounding like I\u2019d just run a mile without warming up. Sweat trickled down my back. I felt a stabbing pain in my gut. And then came that falling feeling\u2014like when you\u2019re almost asleep and suddenly feel like you\u2019re dropping off a cliff.\n\nI staggered. A quiet, panicked noise escaped my mouth.\n\nAnd then\u2014it stopped.\n\nEverything went back to normal. The anxiety vanished. My heart slowed. I couldn\u2019t understand what had just happened. The rest of the crew looked at me with concern and asked if I was okay. I gave a small laugh, shrugged, and said I was probably just tired.\n\nWe took our seats. I had a row to myself. I couldn\u2019t shake what had just happened. I rarely get anxiety and had never had a panic attack. But again, I blamed the sleep deprivation.\n\nAs soon as I closed my eyes, I was out.\n\nI wish I hadn\u2019t fallen asleep.\n\nBecause maybe, just maybe, things would still be normal.\n\nI woke up with a jolt. Chaos. Screaming. Blinking lights. We were falling. The plane was in a nosedive.\n\nThe noise was deafening. The screams from the people\u2014you can\u2019t imagine them. It\u2019s nothing like in the movies. When a person knows they\u2019re about to die, the sound that comes out of them is\u2026 unspeakable. The worst part is hearing the moment someone realizes they\u2019re about to stop being conscious. Being aware that you won\u2019t be aware anymore\u2014that\u2019s the most terrifying thing of all.\n\nI had never feared death before. And I always thought that in a situation like a plane crash, it would all happen so fast you wouldn\u2019t even process it. But you do. I was fully aware that I was falling. That I was about to crash. That I was going to die. And I couldn\u2019t accept it. I thought people found peace in the end. I didn\u2019t. I screamed. And then everything went black.\n\nI can't see anything. But I feel everything. I feel every bone in my body. I feel the weight of the plane pressing me down. I smell the metallic sent of blood. I feel my skull crushed. I felt the blood pouring out of me. \n\nI knew, in that moment, that I was about to die. I knew I had only seconds of awareness left. That waiting, inside that pain, was both an eternity and a void. Right before I faded, I heard someone whisper in my ear:\n\n\"Now everything turns.\"\n\n\n\nAnd then I was gone.\n\n\n\nThen I existed again. On the plane. Whole. Clean. Safe. Nothing was wrong. I was in shock. I can\u2019t describe that feeling. I had died. Really died. It wasn\u2019t like waking from a dream just before impact. I had been dead. \n\nTry to imagine how it felt before you were born. You can\u2019t, can you? You can\u2019t because you didn\u2019t exist. There was no awareness to be aware of. That\u2019s what dying felt like.\n\nLike trying to invent a new color. There\u2019s just nothing there. Nothing at all.\n\nAnd now I existed again. Conscious of my own consciousness.\n\nWe had landed. The rest of the crew was already walking off the plane. I looked down at my hands. And stared. And stared.\n\nSomething was wrong. Nothing big. Just\u2026 missing. Then it clicked. My birthmark. The one on my right palm, at the base of my thumb. It wasn\u2019t there. It was on my left. I turned my hands over. Same thing. The small brown constellation of three dots\u2014my Orion\u2019s Belt\u2014was now on the right hand. Everything was mirrored.\n\nI stood up in a panic, hit my head, and let out a groan. And froze. That didn\u2019t sound like me. I cleared my throat. It sounded wrong. Not like my voice. I didn\u2019t dare say anything else.\n\nI was shaking. Was I having a stroke? What the FUCK was wrong with me? I walked, legs trembling, off the plane and into the fresh air.\n\n\n\nIt was so surreal. I moved carefully down the steps and walked toward the crew a few feet ahead. I sped up and approached the manager, planning to ask the time and whether the flight had been smooth\u2014I had slept the whole way.\n\nThe moment I opened my mouth, I stopped. The voice. It wasn\u2019t mine. I panicked. The manager looked down at me. I panicked harder.\n\nLet\u2019s call him Ollie. I\u2019d been in love with him since the day we met. That kind of love that makes you want to puke. I knew, instantly, I\u2019d never stop loving him. He never loved me back. But we had an affair. He used me. I let him. I knew his body like my own. Every mark, scar, freckle, wrinkle. I loved them all. After we were together, he always had this disgusted look. But I took it, because I knew he\u2019d come back. He wanted my body. I gave it.\n\nBut now\u2026 now his face was wrong. Not completely. Just\u2026 off.\n\nHis nose leaned right instead of left. His right eyebrow sat higher. And the scar he had\u2014the one on the left side of his forehead? It was on the right. Ollie was mirrored.\n\nI must have lost my mind. Ollie looked at me like everything was normal. No confusion, no weird reaction. He asked me if I needed anything. I stared, then shook my head.\n\n must have looked strange. Silent. Staring. But nothing in his expression hinted that he thought anything was weird.\n\nI didn\u2019t speak for the rest of the day. I pointed at my throat and shook my head with a smile to suggest I\u2019d lost my voice. I barely looked at anyone. Because the more I did, the more I saw the reversal.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just people. Or my reflection. The whole world was wrong. My body was wrong. My heart was beating on the wrong side\u2014left, instead of right. My tattoos were all reversed. Cars drove the wrong way. People shook hands with their right\u2014even though they never had before. And my left hand? My dominant hand? I couldn\u2019t write with it anymore. It looked messy. Childlike. I had no control over it.\n\nIt took a while to understand my new voice. I recognized it, but I couldn\u2019t place it. Until it clicked.\n\nIt was the voice that whispered in my ear when I died.\n\nAnd when I woke up, I had a new body, a new voice, a new me.\n\nAs I said before, I went mad. But now I\u2019ve accepted that I\u2019m not where I used to be. So now I\u2019m in your world. Where everything is reversed from mine. Back home, everything was left. And now, everything is right.\n\n\n\nYeah, I know. It sounds crazy. But I\u2019m writing this in case someone out there recognizes what I\u2019m saying. In case someone else has ever\u2026 \"woken up on the wrong side\".\n\n"},"39":{"title":"There are a million things I'd rather do than speak to my brother again.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kibqr2\/there_are_a_million_things_id_rather_do_than\/","flair":"Series","author":"Apprehensive_Two1449","selftext":"I\u2019m an older woman with a demanding job and a family to take care of. I don\u2019t have the time to remember every little thing, and people have described me as scatterbrained. But I can still remember what my brother did the spring I turned ten, down by the leaping river, and how it started everything else.\n\nThat's not just a name I invented, every kid in town called it that because if you stood on the biggest rock and bent your back at the right angle, you could leap to the other side and grab the elm tree branch like a jungle chimp. I should make it clear this wasn\u2019t the kind of venture you just took up any other Saturday. Most of us kids were petrified by the sharp stones that pointed through the river's surface like teeth and the rushing rapids that didn\u2019t care how many years you had left to live. Looking back, it really was a stupid risk for even stupider kids.\u00a0\n\nBut in the spring of 1987, that didn\u2019t matter to my brother Elijah. The only thing that mattered was that Kevin Fackleman told him that he was too chicken-shit to make the jump, which of course was war talk for any fifteen-year-old with a pulse. He told Kevin to meet him at the river at ten that night, and then they\u2019d both see who was a \u201cchicken-shit\u201d.\u00a0\n\nNaturally, he tried to keep this a secret from me. I was eleven years old and somehow hadn't grown out of being the family tattletale. I don\u2019t think I ever would have found out if I hadn\u2019t snooped in on him packing up his backpack.\n\n\u201cWhy do you need the bug killer?\u201d I asked, Elijah dropped his equipment and rushed to close the door. I was still small and quick at that age, so I was able to rush inside the room before he could reach the handle. My brother spun around as I scrambled behind his bed. \u201cGo *away*\u201d he hissed, probably wanting to kick himself for leaving his door open.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked, brushing over his words. My brother narrowed his eyes. \u201cAren't you supposed to be doing homework? I\u2019ll get mom and you\u2019ll have to skip dessert\u201d. My face fell at the thought, but as simple as I was, I still knew one good trick.\n\n\u201cNah, because if you get mom she\u2019ll ask what you\u2019re packing up for, and then she\u2019ll yell and yell and ground you for a week\u201d I whined with slight pride, typical for a brat. Elijah was quiet for a second, then sighed.\u00a0\n\n\u201cFine\u201d. He grunted, picking at the acne that plastered his left cheek.\u00a0\n\nOnce he could tell I was all ears, he told me everything, about how \u201cthat jerk from my gym class\u201d had given him a dare, and how he was gonna show him wrong once mom and dad had gone to bed.\u00a0\n\n\u201cLemme come with you. I wanna see.\u201d\u00a0\n\nMy brother turned away. He zipped up his backpack, slung one of the straps over his right shoulder, and turned his head back to me. I could see a firm \u201cno\u201d in his eyes as he made his way to the door. Just before he turned the knob, his shoulders slumped.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna tell mom and dad, aren't you.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t say anything. I could guess where things were going, and was glad.\n\n\u201cYou can come. Get packed up and meet me outside in three hours. Bring your flashlight, mine\u2019s already a little flickery.\u201d\n\nI smiled. You have to understand I was at the age where an adventure with teenagers was about the coolest, most mature thing I could experience. Imagining how angry my parents would be only made it more exciting. Still, one question remained: what if I fell asleep before the meeting time? After all, my dad was the only one in the house with an alarm clock. \u201cWhat if I\u2019m late?\u201d\n\nElijah didn't say anything, but I could sense his implication that there was no way that would happen.  \nAnd to his credit, he wasn't wrong. We left the house sometime at 11 pm, and that was that. It hadn\u2019t been terribly easy for me with my clumsiness and fear of any resulting noises, but Elijah held my arm down the stairs and whispered promises that \u201cthis door doesn\u2019t creak, remember?\u201d.\u00a0\n\nI remember standing outside the front door with the whole night sky in front of me and nothing but the sound of crickets, and suddenly becoming aware of how small I was. If I had been smarter, I would have seen how stupid I was being and gone back inside. But I was eleven years old, and the chance to see something so exciting up close seemed impossible to pass up.\n\nMy brother was soon several feet ahead of me, and I stopped looking around into the night so I could run to his side. Judging by what I heard from older kids around the neighborhood, terrible things could happen in the night. I thought of such things and hugged my brother\u2019s arm. He barely seemed to notice.\u00a0\n\nA few minutes later, I asked him if \u201cthis Calvin guy will let me watch you jump? Will he send me back?\u201d. Almost reluctantly, Elijah turned his head to me.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHis name is Kevin, and he won\u2019t. Dudes like him always want more attention. He\u2019ll think it\u2019ll be funnier if you see me chicken out.\u201d he said plainly. I smiled hopefully. \u201cYou won\u2019t though, right? You\u2019ll prove him wrong.\u201d I grinned at the thought of a bully in our already rowdy area learning some shame.\u00a0My brother\u2019s eyes turned back to the road, and he said nothing. The crickets sounded quieter after that, and the moon seemed to stare.\u00a0\n\nJust when I thought we might be getting lost, we saw the house my brother said belonged to this \u201cKevin\u201d kid. He walked up to the driveway and made me stand at the border while he went further. I stared at a white chalk drawing on the gravel.\n\nElijah raised the flashlight to one of the windows, and a circular ray shone on the blinds. A few seconds passed, and I heard my brother utter a word I knew mom would scold him for. Was the light not coming through? Would I miss out? Please God, don\u2019t let it be, I thought.\n\nLike an answer to my little prayer, the front door slowly opened, and out stepped a figure around the same size as my brother. Kevin! Elijah swerved his flashlight in his direction, and even from a distance I could see a smile below the hand shielding his eyes. I doubt my brother returned it.\u00a0\n\nKevin went up to Elijah and gave him a good punch on the shoulder. I thought my brother would push him away, but he just stumbled back a little. Both boys ran up to the driveway border, and I could see that Kevin was more prepared than either of us. His backpack was practically swollen, and he had a look of eased confidence that seemed unnatural for someone in his position. Didn\u2019t he know the night\u2019s importance?\u00a0\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s the kid?\u201d he asked, side-eying me like I was a fly on his arm. \u201cShe\u2019s my sister, Chrissy.\u201d my brother answered, and to subtract some embarrassment, added \u201cIt was the only way she wouldn\u2019t tell my mom. She wants to watch.\u201d Kevin grinned, and I knew my brother had been right about him liking an audience.\u00a0\n\n\u201cCool, we\u2019ve got a whole gang. Let\u2019s get going\u201d he said. I was more than ready to take off, but first, he turned to me.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey, don\u2019t start cryin\u2019 if your brother backs out, alright? One of my dad's friends had a farm near the river, and if he hears us, I\u2019m *dead*?\u201d he ordered slowly, as if he didn\u2019t expect me to understand otherwise. He turned his back, and just like that, he and my brother were on their way.\u00a0\n\nI walked behind them, glaring in Kevin\u2019s direction, and for the rest of our journey I stayed completely silent, just watching the other two. Older kids were still something of a mystery to me, and I was both intrigued and somewhat uneased by how my brother changed when around Kevin. He had never been like the brothers I saw on TV, how everyone tells you a brother is *supposed* to act, but there was always something I could rely on with him. He would never get *too* mean, would never do anything beyond a petty insult or pinch on the arm.\u00a0He didn\u2019t have the same emotional restraint at the moment. It seemed every time Kevin opened his mouth, Elijah wanted nothing more than to spit out every curse in the book.\n\nI couldn\u2019t exactly blame him. Kevin seemed pretty intent on telling him details my brother couldn\u2019t care less about (who frenched who behind the gym, how silly he thought my brother\u2019s Greatest American Hero shirt looked), seemingly unaware of my brother\u2019s grimace. Or maybe he did see it. Maybe that was part of the fun.\n\nAfter what must have been an hour, we found ourselves at leaping river. The last ten or so minutes of our journey were through a sprawling field with no houses in sight, and I felt we were rookie explorers of new terrain. I\u2019d been here before (childish boredom breeds exploration) but the night made everything otherworldly and lush and unsure. When the river had come into view, this became all the more clear.\u00a0\n\nThe river, which I *had* seen before out of sheer curiosity, seemed like an animal now. Not just any animal either, but one of those dark pythons that you would thank God for never seeing outside a National Geographic issue. Actually, this was worse. Pythons are relatively slow creatures, and those nasty little teeth reside in the mouth. The river was fast as hell, and as I listened to that water rush, I felt like I could touch the sharp rocks I knew were lurking *everywhere*.\u00a0\n\nAs we walked over leaves and discarded junk from those before us, I could feel my excitement starting to heighten. It had been present before, but now it was almost painful. We were *so close*. Any minute now, the jump would be made, Kevin would hang his head in shame, and I would practically be a big kid just for being there.\u00a0\n\nAnd then, we found it. The three of us stood next to that big rock we knew Elijah would be jumping from, and I couldn\u2019t help but feel at its cold surface. I wanted something to ground me. Otherwise, I thought, I might just jump out of my skin.\n\n\u201cSecond thoughts?\u201d I heard Kevin ask, rudely snapping me back into focus. My brother chuckled, and it sounded more like a growl, if you can believe it. Even in the dark, his eyes shone with something I didn\u2019t like. He seemed even more youthful in his disdain.\u00a0\n\nMy brother crawled up on the rock, and once he stood on top I forgot about everything else. He took deep breaths, shook his arms slightly. Even though I knew the river wasn\u2019t coming any closer, that water sounded louder and louder in my head with every passing second, and with every little thing my brother was whispering under his breath.\u00a0\n\nI thought of Sunday school, of the little paper doves we made after prayers for the needy. In that moment, I wished with my whole heart for *all* my doves to be returned, so I could erase \u201cfor the starving\u201d, and write in \u201cfor my brother\u201d. I knew it was a selfish thought, a sin, but I didn\u2019t care.\u00a0\n\n\u201cPlease god, don\u2019t hurt him\u201d I whispered, clutching the pointiest part of that cold stone like a lifeline.\u00a0\n\nHe jumped.\u00a0\n\nFor a second, it seemed like something kept him in midair, between the rock and that beckoning tree branch. Of course, that couldn\u2019t have been the case, but it was my perception. I must have been taking some sort of mental snapshot, for how else could I still so vividly remember the water under his feet and how his hands stretched out like a cat\u2019s? Again, the moon seemed to stare.\u00a0\n\nAnd then, he made it. Against the worst images I had in my mind, he made it. He grabbed onto that branch, and just\u2026hung on. The only sound louder than the river was his breathing. Now, the flashlight had been set down, and I don\u2019t know if I could fully trust my eyes alone in that darkness, but I believe my brother was crying. It wasn\u2019t the running-for-the-hills sobbing you saw on crappy soap operas or whatever else my mother would curl up to at night, but I *swear* the tears were there. I think they shone a little in the moonlight. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Kevin smiling.\u00a0\n\n\u201cDamn, pretty good for a chicken-shit!\u201d he said with a laugh. I felt some awkwardness from hearing a word like that, said like it was nothing, but I reminded myself that I was an honorary big kid now. As Elijah made his way to the ground, the way the tree was structured making it fairly easy, I told myself that I could handle anything. I looked at Kevin, and felt a smirk forming.\u00a0\n\nMy smugness didn\u2019t last too long. Kevin made his way onto the rock (his sneaker nearly pushed my hand away) and stood like he had something to be proud of.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s my turn, alright?\u201d he called out to Elijah on the other side, seeming to have forgotten about that nearby uncle of his. It dawned on me that Kevin wasn\u2019t the type to feel too bad about losing a bet, particularly with someone he didn\u2019t respect. The fact that he\u2019d been proven wrong didn\u2019t even seem to phase him. As he got ready to jump, I couldn\u2019t help but feel let down.\u00a0\n\nThere was less apprehension at Kevin\u2019s attempt, seeing as how I\u2019d already watched my scrawnier brother make the leap. He and I both watched the other boy jump, and I could faintly hear my brother click his tongue in annoyance. I could already guess the remarks he was sure to make on the trip back home. Kevin grabbed onto the branch, and unlike Elijah, there was no shaky breathing or possible tears. He just hung there, smiling like an idiot. He didn\u2019t even *sound* scared.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey Eli, it isn\u2019t that hard, see?\u201d he said, swinging his legs around just to show off. \u201cGot yourself all worked up over nothing, didn\u2019t ya?\u201d he added. He chuckled to himself, and I realized that this was nothing to him. Jumping the river may have been a challenge to kids my age or someone skin-and-bones as my brother, but someone as currently comfortable as Kevin must have had enough school sports and roughhousing to make something like this a leisure.\u00a0This was all about him. I only served as an audience member, and my brother\u2019s only purpose was to be a comparison. To be worse.\u00a0\n\nAs Kevin\u2019s laughter rang on and on, I began to fret. Kevin might have made up his uncle just to scare me into being quiet, but still, an angry adult is an angry adult. I picked up the put-aside flashlight, and shone it toward Elijah. He gave an irritated squint, and then stared back at Kevin. That look in his eyes\u2026it put a horrible feeling in me, to see someone so filled with loathing. With every laugh from Kevin, it was like something was growing inside him. As he looked up at the boy on the branch, that youthful hatred returned to the surface.An idea had formed.\n\nWith some primal noise I\u2019ve never heard since, my brother pushed Kevin into the rushing, teeth-stone filled water.\u00a0\n\nIf my terror hadn't seized me the way it did, I may have taken notice of how easily he went down. Again, Elijah wasn\u2019t strong by any means, but Kevin must have been so lost in his own glory that his body was caught off guard. With no more than a push and a jab to his arm, he fell into that river and got his jaw struck by the nearest rock. Any fears of nearby adults instantly vanished, and I yelled bloody murder. I screamed and screamed and screamed until my throat stung, and it was still dwarfed by the noises Kevin was making.\u00a0\n\nHe was gasping, crying, and screeching all at once, his voice carrying a feeling he shouldn\u2019t have known at that age. As I stood there like a cornered animal, I once again remembered Sunday school. We weren\u2019t taught much about hell, but our teacher had reluctantly told us, very briefly, about those screaming people and their torment. As Kevin\u2019s cries surrounded me, I could think of no other comparison.\u00a0\n\nI looked at my brother, and saw him standing *just* close enough to where he could pull Kevin back up. As tears clouded my view, I hollered out to him.\u00a0\n\n\u201cElijah!\u201d I wailed. No response. He just stood there, looking down at Kevin gripping the same rock that had struck him the way a blade would. He was swearing more than ever through his crying, using words I didn\u2019t even know. I heard him call out for his mother. That\u2019s something my mind will never blur.\u00a0\n\nI yelled again. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d \u201cPull him out!\u201d \u201cAre you stupid?\u201d I cried, even though I knew idiocy wasn\u2019t the culprit here. How could he have pushed him? How could he just *be* there, and not cry as I did? I saw something in my brother that my young mind couldn\u2019t read. In retrospect, it couldn\u2019t have been anything else but silent victory.\u00a0\n\nPeople, especially kids, usually aren\u2019t terribly clever in moments of panic. Perhaps this is why I grabbed the flashlight, crouched down to where the grass met the water, and reached out my free hand. The water coursed under my arm, the sound combining with everything else and pushing me to cry even more.\u00a0\n\n\u201cKevin!\u201d I shouted. He looked at me, and I gasped to see the blood dripping from his chin. It just kept coming, like foam from the mouth of a rabid dog. Up close, I could see his eyes were manic and had a puffiness around them. I knew he was the same Kevin from before, but he looked more like some wounded animal. \u201cKevin, please hold on! I\u2019m gonna pull you\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\nI couldn\u2019t finish my sentence. Someone was looking at me.\u00a0\n\nI slowly gazed upwards, and just as I figured, my brother had turned his stare to me. For a second, I thought the very worst, but I soon realized he wasn\u2019t gazing at me with any contempt.\u00a0\n\nHe looked at me, as I was with my quivering hand and screwed face, and then at that merciless river. But he wasn\u2019t planning any harm to me. He seemed uneasy. He could always see, especially now, how small I was. Too small and weak to not fall in.\n\n\u201cChrissy, step back, alright? I\u2019ll pull him back up\u201d he said. He had to shout to be heard over Kevin\u2019s crying, and he *still* sounded too calm. I shook my head, and his eyes narrowed. \u201cChrissy, step back. Now.\u201d He sounded so firm, and on a night like this, I wasn\u2019t keen on taking chances. I slowly withdrew my hand and ambled back several steps. I stared at my brother and Kevin, thinking of one last prayer for the night.\u00a0\n\n\u201cPlease god, make him keep his promise\u201d I whispered.\u00a0\n\nI saw Elijah crouch down to where Kevin could hear him better. I heard the faintest of words, but couldn\u2019t make any of them out. After a while, Kevin quit screaming, and his cries turned softer. I saw nodding. Then, after there was nothing but pained whimpers, my brother took hold of Kevin\u2019s arms and hauled him out. It looked awfully hard, but still. My brother was true to his word.\n\nOnce Kevin was on dry land, I expected him to sock my brother in the jaw. It would have been the *least* he deserved. But instead, he just stood there. Just held himself, and wept. He didn\u2019t look at either of us.\u00a0\n\nThen he ran. Just took off like a rabbit into the score of trees, not looking back even once. The sound of his footsteps faded, and it was just me and Elijah under that staring moon.\n\nI fell backward, and curled into myself. I shut my eyelids so tight it hurt and hoped that everything would be gone when I opened them. I wanted everything to be gone. The river, the grass under my skin, and especially Elijah.\u00a0\n\nAs I hugged my knees, I imagined how lovely it would be to open my eyes and be back home. Yes, I would be in my room, with a pillow under my head instead of a dirt patch. My stack of Ramona and Little House books would be waiting for me, the Growing Pain's poster near my mirror would show those made-for-tv smiles, and my brother would somehow be worlds away.\u00a0\n\nI got lost in my vision of home, trying to make the walls and furniture seem real enough to touch. It became so hypnotizing that I didn\u2019t take heed of Elijah\u2019s jump and footsteps until his hand was on me. I recoiled, unable to look at him or even speak. I felt him rub my shoulder. As you can probably imagine, such gentleness was baffling.\u00a0\n\n\u201cChrissy, just breathe, alright?\u201d\n\nHis voice was so low. Was he really trying to comfort me *now*? I tried to shake his hand off, still not daring to meet his eyes. I was too weak, as per usual. He kept breathing at a methodical pace, as if there was an invisible counter over our heads. I followed his example. He still terrified me, but I would have grasped onto anything at that moment.\u00a0\n\nIn, out. In, out. In, out.\u00a0\n\n*In, out. In, out. In, out.*\u00a0\n\nAs I lay there exhaling with his arm sloped over me, my brother began to repeat himself. \u201cEverything\u2019s okay\u201d he muttered over and over. His voice took on a rhythm of it\u2019s own to match my breathing. He hugged me, and I finally gave in.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone\u201d I whispered, my voice like a long shudder. I had made this kind of promise many times before, but this time I truly meant it. It was less a fear of consequence, and more of a deep guilt. Maybe my first. Somehow, just *being* here felt like I had carried out everlasting sin.\u00a0\n\nMy brother helped me to my feet, and I could see he wasn\u2019t looking at me either. His eyes seemed glued to the grass and dirt under his feet. He picked up the flashlight, and we started to walk away from that river. Little by little, the sound of that rushing water grew faint, until it was completely muted. I found myself pushing my brother's arm forward a little. Going home, wanting home, needing home.\u00a0\n\n\u201cChrissy?\u201d\u00a0\n\nI looked at him, *his* eyes still downwerds. There was a meekness to his voice, a shame that ran deeper than mine.\u00a0\n\n\u201cY\u2019know that book you wanted for Christmas? Ozma of Oz?\u201d he asked.\n\nMy eyes began to sting again. Was he making fun of me? He must be, I thought. He\u2019d always given me a bad time at home for my doll obsession, and he just couldn\u2019t resist it here either. I wanted to turn around and punch him right where that rock had hit Kevin. I just might have tried, if it weren\u2019t for what Elijah said next.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI, uh, got some cash last week from mowing the lawn, I think it should be enough to buy you one of those\u201d. He looked at me, and he gave me a look I couldn\u2019t recall seeing in him before. \u201cYou\u2019d like that, right?\u201d. He said it like a question, but I could tell it was really a command.\u00a0\n\nAnd yet\u2026\n\nHe sounded softer then usual, even softer than when he was getting me to stop crying. Like all the air had been taken out his lungs, and he was only now getting bits of it back. And yet, he still wanted me to know he would buy me that doll.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019d like that\u201d I mumbled, a mix between sore and thankful as I thought about my brother giving me that Barbie. I already had one at home, but I had lost her only dress months ago, and the dog had left a score of bite marks on her legs. A quick curl Barbie would be shiny and new, and I would *keep* her that way.\u00a0\n\nOnce more, I looked up at Elijah. He wasn\u2019t facing downwards anymore, and he seemed to be walking with more purpose now. I took particular note of his eyes. I could tell something was turning over behind them.\u00a0Something was leaving.\n\nI'll write more some other time, when I feel ready to. Thanks for reading."},"40":{"title":"I attended a funeral.

Over there.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot now Jacob.\u201d\n\nNo one else in the church seemed remotely aware that the living dead were among them. The focus was on the sermon.\n\n\u201cWe gather here today in love, sorrow, and remembrance\u2026\u201d the priest began.\n\nWhen I looked back, Uncle Ross was sitting a row closer than before. He tugged at his peppery beard and looked at me with his wild green eyes. \u201c*Hey Jakey!\u201d*\n\nUnwittingly, I let out a scream.\u00a0\n\nThe priest paused. Everyone looked at me. My mother grabbed me by the shoulder.\n\n\u201cJacob what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026 Can\u2019t you see him?\u201d\n\n\u201cSee *who*?\u201d\n\nEveryone gave me the side-eye, clearly perturbed by the spasm of a young boy. No one seemed to notice the obviously visible, smiling Uncle Ross amidst the crowd.\n\nI pointed to where I saw him, standing three pews down.\n\n\u201cUncle Ross\u2026\u201d I said, half-whispering, half-confused.\n\nMy mother glanced back, and shook her head. She grabbed my hand with a stern look. \u201cAre you going to behave?\u201d\n\nEveryone was looking at where I had pointed to. No one appeared to notice Uncle Ross.\u00a0\n\nBut I could see him.\n\nIn fact, my uncle smiled at me, looked around himself and shrugged in a joking way, as if to say: *Uncle Ross, haven't seen him!*\n\nI turned and closed my eyes. *There was no way this was happening. There was no way this was happening.*\u00a0\n\nI focused on the priest, on the old, warbly, tenor of his voice.\n\n\u201c... A grandson, brother and a lifelong employee of *CERN*, our dearly departed made several significant contributions in his life. He had, as many said, \u2018a brilliant mind\u2019, and always lit up any room he was in...\u201d\n\nI grit my teeth and glanced back.\u00a0\n\nUncle Ross was gone.\u00a0\n\nIn his spot: empty air.\u00a0\n\nAnd then a callused grip touched on my wrist. I looked up. Uncle Ross sitting beside me.\u00a0\n\nA single finger on his lips. *\u201cShh.\u201d*\n\nA moment ago the spot beside me was bare, and now my uncle smiled, giggling through his teeth.\n\nFear froze me stiff.\n\n\u201cJust pretend I'm not here, Jakey. Don't mind me any mind.\u201d\n\nMy mother hadn't turned an inch. She was ignoring me and watching the priest.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it funny?\u201d Uncle Ross chuckled. He was speaking on a wavelength that clearly only I could hear. \u201cAll these clodpoles think I\u2019m dead. They think I\u2019m *dead* Jakey! But that's not my real body. No, no. That's just the duplicate. That's just the decoy.\u201d\n\nI turned away from this ghost\u00a0and kept my eyes on the priest. I didn't know what was happening. But I knew it *wasn't supposed to be* *happening*.\n\n\u201cI chose you on purpose, Jakey. You were the youngest. It had to be you.\u201d\n\nMy uncle's breath felt icy on my ear.\n\nMy whole neck was seizing up.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be the one to turn on **the machine** in fifty years. That's all I need you to do. Turn on **the machine** in 2044. I\u2019ll tell you more when the time comes.\u201d\n\nHe cleared his throat and patted my right knee. My entire lower body seized up too.\n\nUncle Ross left his seat and walked out into the front aisle.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou and I versus the world, kid! Now how about we make this funeral memorable huh?\u201d Uncle Ross grinned. \u201cLet's commemorate a little.\u201d\n\nHe walked up onto the dais and stood right next to the reverend.\n\n\u201c\u2026Although we lost him in an unfortunate accident. His warmth, his influence, and of course, his scientific contributions will live on for many decades to come\u2026\u201d\n\nUncle Ross lifted his hand, made a fist, and then calmly *phased* it through the priest's head. It's as if my uncle was a *hologram.*\n\nThen Uncle Ross\u2019 pudgy two fingers poked out of the priest\u2019s eyes\u2014as if the priest was being gouged from the inside. The pudgy fingers wiggled and swam around the old man\u2019s entire scalp.\n\nThe holy father froze.\u00a0\n\nA glazed look befell his eyes.\u00a0\n\nSilence in the church.\n\nEveryone's breath stopped.\n\n\u201cFather Remy, is everything\u2014?\u201d\n\nThe priest collapsed to the floor, flipping and contorting violently. The seizure made him roll, spasm, and audibly tear ligaments.\n\n\u201cOh my goodness!\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone help!\u201d\n\nA thin man in a tweed suit stepped out from the front\u2014someone from Uncle Ross\u2019 work.\u00a0\n\nThe tweed man cleared all of the fallen candles off the stage, and sat beside the spasming reverend, protecting the old man's arms from hitting the podium.\n\n\u201cAnd look there Jakey!\u201d Uncle Ross hunched over, standing overtop of the tweed man. \u201cThat\u2019s Leopold! Look at him, such a good samaritan.\u201d\n\nMy uncle pointed at Leopold's head.\n\n\u201cThis colleague of mine was the only one smart enough to understand my work. He *knew* what I was trying to accomplish in particle physics \u2026 \u201c\n\nUncle Ross walked over, his legs phasing through the struggling priest, and then squatted right beside his colleague.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAnd now, he shall know no more.\u201d\n\nMy Uncle wrapped Leopold in a bear hug, phasing into his entire head and torso. The back of my uncle's head was superimposed over Leopold's shocked face.\u00a0\n\nBlood gushed out of Leopold\u2019s nose. He fell and joined the priest, seizuring violently on the stage.\n\n\u201cDear God!\u201d\n\n\u201cLeo!\u201d\n\nEveryone stared at the dais. There were now two convulsing men whipping their arms back and forth, smacking themselves into the podium.\u00a0\n\nMy mom moved to help, but I yanked her back.\n\n\u201cNo! Get away!\u201d\n\n\u201cJacob, what are you\u2014?\u201d\n\n*\u201cAAAAAHHH!!\u201d*\u00a0\n\nMy aunt\u2019s scream was deafening.\n\nShe watched in horror as her husband *also* fell.\u00a0 He rolled in the aisle, frothed at the mouth and joined the contagious seizure spreading throughout the church.\n\nMy uncle stood above him, laughing. \u201cFlopping like fish!\u201d\n\nI tugged with inhuman strength, that\u2019s how my mother always described it, *inhuman strength.* I pulled us both down between the pews, and out the back of the church.\n\nAfter dragging my mom into the parking lot, I screamed\u00a0repeatedly to *\u201cOpen the car and drive! Drive! Drive! Drive!\"*\n\nMy heart was in pure panic.\n\nI remember staring out the back seat of my mom\u2019s speeding Honda, watching my uncle casually phase through funeral attendees, leaving a trail of writhing and frothing epileptics.\n\nAs our car turned away, my uncle cupped around his mouth and yelled, \u201cRemember Jakey! You\u2019ll be the one to turn on **the machine!** You\u2019ll be the one to bring me back!\u201d\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI was eight years old when that incident happened.\u00a0\n\nEight.\n\nOf course no one believed me. And my mother attributed my wild imagination to the trauma of the event.\u00a0\n\nIt was described as a \u201cmass psychogenic illness\u201d. A freak occurrence unexplainable by the police, ambulance, or anyone else.\u00a0\n\nMost of the epileptic episodes ended, and people returned to normalcy. Sadly, some of the older victims, like the priest, passed away.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI\u2019m in my late thirties now.\n\nAnd although you may not believe me. That story is true.\n\nMy whole life I\u2019ve been living in fear. Horrified by the idea of encountering mad Uncle Ross yet again.\u00a0\n\nHe was said to have lost his mind amongst academic circles, spending his last year at CERN on probation for \u2018equipment abuse\u2019. People had reportedly seen him shoot high powered UV lasers into his temples. He became obsessed with something called \u201c*Particle Decoherence\u201d\u2014* a theory that was thoroughly debunked as impossible.\n\nI\u2019ve seen him in nightmares.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ve seen him in bathroom reflections.\u00a0\n\nSometimes I can feel his icy cold breath on my neck.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ve seriously been worried almost every day of my life that he\u2019s going to reappear again at some large group gathering and cause havoc.\u00a0\n\nBut thankfully that hasn\u2019t happened. Not yet.\n\nHowever, I have a feeling it will happen again soon. You see, yesterday I had a visitor.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAlthough graying and blind in one eye, I still recognized Leopold from all those years ago.\u00a0\n\nHe came out of the blue, with a package at my apartment, and said that there had been a discovery regarding my late uncle.\n\n\u201cIt was an old basement room, hidden behind a wall,\u201d Leopold said. \u201cThe only reason we discovered it was because the facility was undergoing renovations.\u201d\n\nHe lifted a small cardboard box and placed it on my kitchen counter.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe don't know how it's possible. But we discovered your uncle's skeleton inside.\u201d\n\nI blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cA skeleton wearing Ross\u2019 old uniform and name tag anyway. He was inside some kind of *makeshift* *cryogenic machine.* The rats had long ago broken in. Gnawed him to the bone.\u201d\n\nHe swiveled the box to me and undid a flap.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI was visiting town and wanted to say hello to your mother. But after discovering this, I thought I should visit you first.\u201d\n\nI emptied the box's contents, discovered a small cotton cap with many ends. Like a Jester's cap. It looked like it was fashioned for the head of a small child. *Perhaps an 8-year-old boy.*\u00a0\n\n\u201cAs I'm sure you know, your uncle was not *well of mind* in his final months at Geneva. We could all see it happening. He was advised to see many therapists \u2026 I don't believe he did.\u201d\n\nI rotated the cap in my hands, hearing the little bells jingle on each tassel.\n\n\u201cBut I knew he always liked you. He spoke highly of his nephew.\u201d\n\nI looked into Leopold's remaining colored eye. \u201cHe did? Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh I think he saw you as a symbol of the next generation. That whatever he discovered could be passed down to you as a next of kin. That's my sense of it.\u201d\n\nThere was a bit of black stitching on the front of the red cap. Pretty cursive letters. I stretched out the fabric.\n\n\u201cI don't know what he meant with this gift, but we found it within his cobwebbed and dilapidated \u2018machine\u2019. I feel certain he wanted you to have it.\u201d\n\nI read the whole phrase.\u00a0\n\n*You and I versus the world kid.*\n\nI bit my lip. A razorwire of fear coiled around my throat. I swallowed it away.\n\n\u201cSo how did you find his skeleton at CERN? Didn't we already bury his body a long time ago?\u201d\n\nLeopold folded up the empty cardboard box with his pale old fingers.\n\n\u201cYour uncle was an enigma his whole life. No one knew why he jumped into that reactor 30 years ago.\u201d Leo walked back to my doorway, I could tell that the topic was not a comfortable one to discuss.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent a notable portion of my life trying to figure out what your uncle was thinking. But it's led me nowhere. His theory of *Particle Decoherence* was sadly proven false.\u201d\n\nI wanted to offer Leopold a coffee or something, he had only just arrived, but he was already wrapping his scarf back around his neck.\n\n\u201cHey, you don't have to leave just yet\u2026\u201d\n\nSome kind of heavy weight fell upon Leopold. Something too dark to explain. He took a few deep breaths and then, quite abruptly, grabbed both of my shoulders.\n\n\u201cHe wanted you to have it okay. Just take it. Take the cap.\"\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever you do Jacob, just stay *away* from him! If you see him again, *run*! Don't look at him. Don't talk to him. Don't pay him any attention!\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, wait, Leopold, what are you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYour uncle is supposed to be *dead,* Jacob. And no matter what promises you, he\u2019s lying. Your uncle is supposed to be dead! HE\u2019S SUPPOSED TO BE GODDAMN [DEAD!](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/EclosionK2\/comments\/1g0837r\/welcome\/)\u201d"},"41":{"title":"They shouldn't turn any old building into a nursing home","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1ki92y8\/they_shouldnt_turn_any_old_building_into_a\/","flair":null,"author":"Otherwise-Green8403","selftext":"I\u2019ve always been a history buff, drawn to the eerie beauty of old buildings with stories etched into their walls. Nursing homes, where I\u2019ve spent years as a CNA, usually feel predictable\u2014sterile halls, faded wallpaper, the buzz of routine care. But Stonerise was different. From the moment I stepped into its looming red-brick facade, something felt *wrong*. The building, a former tuberculosis hospital built in 1927, was massive: a four-story main building (B unit) with two three-story wings (A and C units) sprawling from either side, framing a courtyard that faced the sleepy town. It became a home for the elderly in the 1970s, but its past clung to it like damp rot.\n\nOrientation was a slog\u2014HIPAA videos, dementia training, and fake-friendly faces that turned cold when you asked for help. The only break came when Bill, the grizzled maintenance man, offered a tour of A unit, where we\u2019d been holed up for training. The upper floors of A unit were off-limits to everyone except maintenance and the facility\u2019s administrator, its secured elevator a silent gatekeeper. The first floor was mundane: a few offices, a resident shop for snacks and mail. Bill mentioned the building\u2019s history as a TB sanatorium, and my curiosity stirred. I\u2019ve always loved the macabre, but nothing could\u2019ve prepared me for what came next.\n\nWe took the elevator to the second floor of A unit, the oldest part of the facility. It was the main patient ward back when TB ravaged the state, before B and C units were added to handle the overflow. The air was thick with must, the walls scuffed, tiles chipped, paint peeling in long, curling strips. A faint smell of water damage lingered. Bill pointed out old doctors\u2019 offices, exam rooms, and, at the end of the hall, the morgue. My heart raced\u2014I had to see it. I thought that\u2019d be the highlight of the tour. I was wrong.\n\nThe elevator carried us to the third floor. As the doors slid open, a cold breeze hit me, raising goosebumps. I stepped out and froze. The hallway was lined with rusted jail cells, some chains bolted to the floor, others dangling from the ceiling like grotesque chandeliers. Bill\u2019s voice was calm, almost bored, as he explained: prisoners with TB\u2014rapists, murderers, and lesser offenders\u2014were sent here to recover or die. The coughing disease didn\u2019t discriminate. The cells, corroded and skeletal, seemed to watch us. I felt a chill that wasn\u2019t just the draft. We didn\u2019t stay long.\n\nThe next night, I started my first shift at 11 p.m. on 2B. The resident I was assigned to sit with one-on-one had been rushed to the hospital after trying to attack an elderly woman. With no one to monitor, I was told to help the other CNAs and answer call lights. I hit it off with Julie, a young CNA with a sharp wit. We bonded over the building\u2019s creepy history, swapping stories about the constant feeling of being watched, like eyes were boring into your back. Emboldened by our shared unease, we decided to sneak into A unit to find the morgue.\n\nUsing our phone flashlights, we slipped past the double doors from B to A unit. The second floor was as dilapidated as I remembered, the air heavy with decay. It didn\u2019t take long to spot the morgue\u2014a cracked door letting in a sliver of parking lot light. I pushed it open, and a foul stench hit me, like something long dead. Julie swore she didn\u2019t smell a thing. Inside were old cabinets, a steel table where countless bodies had lain, and a wooden wheelchair, its cracked frame slouched in the corner. We froze at a rustling sound down the hall\u2014probably a rat. As we turned to check, a metallic *clank* echoed behind us, like a drawer slamming shut in the cabinet. An icy cold enveloped the room, sharp and unnatural. We bolted, speed-walking down the hallway, our footsteps loud in the silence. But there was another sound\u2014another set of footsteps, heavier, deliberate, not ours, not an echo. We reached the double doors, panting, relief washing over us.\n\nThen I felt it again\u2014that prickling sense of being watched. Something screamed in my gut not to look back, but I did. Through the windowpane of the double doors, a pale, gray face stared back, its lips curled into a wide, menacing smile. It wasn\u2019t human\u2014not anymore. Its eyes were hollow, but the grin radiated malice. I stumbled back, heart hammering, and forced myself to focus on work.\n\nLater, during my lunch break, I realized I\u2019d left my food in my truck. I headed to the staff elevator on 2B and pressed the button. The display showed it was already on the second floor, so I braced for the doors to open. Instead, the elevator hummed, ascending. 3\u2026 4\u2026 *Ding*. The faint sound of doors opening echoed from above. My stomach dropped. The fourth floor was off-limits, empty, a husk of unused space. No one had been near the elevator before me. The hum started again as it descended. 3\u2026 2\u2026 *Ding*. The doors slid open. Nothing. Just an empty elevator. I stepped inside, and that same rotten stench from the morgue filled the air, thick and suffocating. I jabbed the button for the first floor, my skin crawling. I wasn\u2019t alone. As the doors opened, a cold breeze rushed past me, like something brushing by.\n\nI made it to my truck, heart pounding, and sat there, gripping the steering wheel. The cab felt too small, the air too heavy. I glanced at the passenger seat, half-expecting to see that gray, smiling face. Nothing. But the feeling never left\u2014a certainty that something had followed me, was *still* with me, waiting. I don\u2019t know if I can go back to Stonerise. Not after what I saw. Not after what I felt.\n\n"},"42":{"title":"I don\u2019t think I\u2019m me.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1ki1gdf\/i_dont_think_im_me\/","flair":null,"author":"NoxiousSpoon","selftext":"I know that sounds strange\u2014and yeah, if I heard someone else say it, I\u2019d probably tell them to see a psychiatrist. But it\u2019s true. I would never wear a striped sweater. And definitely not on a random day in July. I don\u2019t even own striped sweaters.\n\nYet there I was, in a photo inside a photo album my best friend\u2019s mom was showing me\u2014grinning in a red-and-blue striped knit like it belonged on me. And that wasn\u2019t the only strange thing.\n\nEarlier this week, I came home from a month-long work trip. I was exhausted, dragging my suitcase through the door when my girlfriend greeted me.\n\n\u201cHey, baby\u2014I made your favorite meal. Eat it before it gets cold. I\u2019m gonna go run a bath for us,\u201d Amy called over her shoulder.\n\nChicken Parmesan.\n\nI didn\u2019t think much of it at the time. I was tired, hungry, and honestly touched by the gesture. I sat down and inhaled the food without hesitation. It was good\u2014really good.\n\nToo good.\n\nHalfway through rinsing my plate, it hit me: I don\u2019t even like chicken.\nI never have. I haven\u2019t eaten it since I was a kid. The texture makes my skin crawl.\n\nSo why the hell did I eat an entire plate of it without even noticing?\n\nI shook it off. Jet lag, maybe. Or maybe I was just being dramatic. I got in the shower with Amy, didn\u2019t say anything, and we went to bed.\n\nThe next morning, I was getting ready for work when Amy tossed me my keys and kissed me goodbye. I caught them midair and headed downstairs. Halfway I felt them in my hand, something was off. The grooves, the weight. They weren\u2019t mine.\n\nI looked down.\nHonda keys.\n\nI rushed back up the stairs.\n\n\u201cWhose keys are these?\u201d I asked, trying not to sound as shaken as I felt.\n\nAmy looked up from her coffee, brow furrowing. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cThese keys, Amy. They\u2019re not mine. I drive a Toyota\u2014so whose are these? Don\u2019t play dumb.\u201d\n\nShe blinked. \u201cHoney, are you feeling okay? Those are your keys, stupid,\u201d she said with a soft laugh.\n\n\u201cNo, they\u2019re not.\u201d My voice dropped cold.\n\nWithout saying a word, Amy disappeared into the hallway, then returned holding a framed picture.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s you,\u201d she said, handing it to me.\n\nIn the photo, I was standing next to a shiny new Honda Civic at a dealership. Huge smile. Handshake with the salesman. Wearing\u2014of course\u2014a striped sweater.\n\n\u201cThat was six months ago, babe. When I surprised you with the car. Do you seriously not remember?\u201d\n\nI opened my mouth, but nothing came out. That was me. My face, my grin, my stance. But it felt like I was looking at a stranger with my skin.\n\nI hurried into the bedroom, pulled open the closet\u2014and froze.\n\nDozens of sweaters. Striped, patterned, holiday-themed. My entire wardrobe looked like an ugly sweater convention.\n\nAmy followed me in, concern all over her face.\n\u201cJamie, are you okay? You\u2019re starting to worry me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I lied. \u201cJust didn\u2019t sleep well.\u201d I said\nEven though I slept like a baby. \n\nI kissed her on the cheek and left for work. Outside, the Civic sat gleaming in the driveway. It looked familiar now. I got in\u2014it smelled like me. Air fresheners, black tree scent. LED lights under the dash. Everything clean and organized. Exactly as I would have it. \n\nBut it still felt wrong. Like I was stepping into someone else\u2019s life who just happened to be me.\n\nI arrived at the office late, feeling hazy. As I settled into my usual desk, a voice interrupted me.\n\n\u201cJamie, you\u2019re at my desk,\u201d said Andrew, my annoying coworker.\n\nI looked up. \u201cWhat? No, I\u2019ve always sat here. Just because I\u2019ve been gone for a while doesn\u2019t mean you can steal my desk, Mountain Drew.\u201d\n\n\u201cMountain Drew? Seriously?\u201d he muttered, pushing up his glasses.\n\nWe had a bit of a back and forth and Ten minutes later, I was in HR.\n\n\u201cDo you know what your position is here?\u201d the woman behind the desk asked.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m in charge of the Orbus Project.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what does that entail?\u201d she asked, typing something.\n\nI opened my mouth. Closed it. Then opened it again.\n\n\u201cI\u2026attend meetings, organize\u2026wait.\u201d\nI blinked.\n\n\u201cWhat is the relevance of this question?\u201d I deflected.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d she said, swiveling her monitor slightly, \u201cyou\u2019re in the wrong department. Wrong floor, actually. And according to your file, you haven\u2019t been assigned to the Orbus Project. That doesn\u2019t launch for another two months. You were moved to Data Processing last month after your last incident.\u201d\n\nMy stomach dropped.\n\n\u201cWhat incident?\u201d\n\nShe scrolled through my record with a practiced sigh. \u201cThe one where you were caught dumping unmarked liquid into coworkers\u2019 lunches in the break room. Honestly, you\u2019re lucky you weren\u2019t fired.\u201d\n\nI sat frozen in the chair, every nerve in my body screaming.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is happening to me?\u201d \nThe words slipped out before I could stop myself. \n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d She asked\n\nMy face turned slightly red , \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m just having a hard time readjusting after the work trip. \u201c \n\n\u201cOkay Mr Jamie, why don\u2019t you just go on ahead back to your proper work area. And try to stay out of trouble please, the paperwork isn\u2019t easy on these old fingers you know. \u201c \n\n\u201cYes of course, thank you.\u201d I said as I quickly and quietly whisked away back into the building. After asking around a bit I finally made it to my actual desk. Everyone on that floor acted as if I belonged there. I got a quick run-down of my tasks and got right to it. Trying to not think about all the bizarre things that happened, I decided to put it out of mind and focus solely on work. \n\nAbout 30 minutes before I had to clock out I decided to go through my emails. I didn\u2019t see anything out of the ordinary. I checked my drafts and saw my last draft dated on the day I went on to the work trip. \n\n\u201c subject : Orbus\n\n: sweet Red. It\u2019s not me. \nTake the call. \u201c \n\nIt made no sense. But I didn\u2019t know what to make of it. So I just went back to work.  \n\n\nBesides that first day back , everything else seemed to be running smoothly. I got through the week without any more hiccups. I didn\u2019t mention my apprehension to Amy because she is such a worrywart. \nThat was until today. \n\nI had planned to visit my best friends family for a weekend BBQ-kind of an unofficial celebration for his nieces upcoming graduation. I got there relatively early. Honestly I was looking forward to it. I needed something familiar. But if I thought that today would bring me peace I was wrong. \n\nThe grill was already going when I got there. The scent of charcoal and barbecue sauce hit me before I even stepped out of the car. Kids were running around the yard with water guns, and someone had queued up an early 2000s playlist on a Bluetooth speaker. It felt\u2026right.\n\nI needed this. Familiar faces.  I spotted Marcus\u2014my best friend since middle school\u2014near the back porch, beer in hand, laughing with his cousin. He lit up when he saw me.\n\n\u201cJamie! Look who finally decided to show up,\u201d he said, pulling me into a quick hug.\n\n\u201cHey, man. Sorry I\u2019m early\u2014didn\u2019t want to miss the ribs this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmart move,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re not still vegetarian, are you?\u201d\n\nThat made me pause. \u201cI was never vegetarian,\u201d I said, half-laughing.\n\nHe blinked, then shrugged. \u201cOh right, yeah.\u201d \n\nThe moment passed, but something about it lingered.\n\nI grabbed a plate, made small talk, accepted a drink. For the first time all week, I felt like myself again\u2014until I wandered inside to use the bathroom.\n\nOn the hallway wall, right before the guest bathroom, was a photo collage I\u2019d seen a dozen times before. I\u2019d even helped Marcus\u2019s mom hang it last year. But this time, something was off.\n\nAt the center of the collage, surrounded by prom photos and school portraits, was a framed picture of me and Marcus at the lake house. I remember that trip\u2014or at least I thought I did.\n\nBut in the photo, I was wearing a striped sweater again.\nThe same red-and-blue one from the dealership photo.\n\nI stared at it for a long time. My arm was around Marcus\u2019s shoulder. We were grinning, beers in hand. But there was something wrong with my face\u2014too wide a smile. Almost\u2026posed. Unnatural.\nWhy would I even wear a sweater in the sweaty July weather at a Lake anyway? \n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d a voice said behind me. I jumped.\n\nIt was Marcus\u2019s mom, holding a bowl of potato salad. She smiled warmly. \u201cBathroom\u2019s just there, hon.\u201d\n\nI nodded. \u201cYeah, thanks. I just\u2014I don\u2019t remember this picture being here.\u201d\n\nShe looked at it. \u201cOh, you two had so much fun that weekend! You don\u2019t remember? We printed that out the same night you all came back. You helped me pick the frame, Jamie.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah, I must still be tired,\u201d I said quickly, slipping past her into the bathroom and locking the door behind me.\n\nI turned on the sink and stared at myself in the mirror.\n\nSame face.

Gray strands of *something\u2013*maybe cobwebs or ripped insulation\u2013hung from the rafters above. The crowd was so thick I couldn't move, but even more masked, half-dressed people were still coming down the stairs. As a pre-med student, I knew that standing so close to the speakers meant guaranteed hearing damage--\n\nBut I was just glad to be attending my first-ever college party.\n\nA shirtless guy with curly black hair gripped the sides of a keg and flexed into a perfect handstand. He chugged so much beer that I felt sick just watching him, then dive-rolled into the shrieking crowd. He was my roommate, Brett Harrison the Third, and he was the only reason why I had been invited out that night.\n\nThe truth was, I never felt like I fit at this elite university, or even in this country. My parents immigrated to the United States from Japan a few weeks after my ninth birthday. I was just old enough to understand that I was leaving my home and friends behind forever, but still too young to think of the change as an opportunity.\n\nEveryone was so much louder and more aggressive than I was used to, the food was greasy or overly-sweet, and most of my classmates didn\u2019t seem to care about school at all. Every night, I prayed that my parents would take me back to my home country--\n\nBut their minds were made up.\u00a0\n\nAs far as they were concerned, my future was already decided: I would graduate from a U.S. high school, study medicine at a top-tier university, and have a respectable, high-paying career anywhere that I pleased. *Couldn\u2019t I see how much they were sacrificing to give me this once-in-a-lifetime chance?*\n\nMy classmates didn\u2019t understand the pressure I was under, or why I had to prioritize studying over socializing. By my second year of college, I had resigned myself to a friendless existence\u2026and then, Brett moved in.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter to *him* that I always had my nose buried in a textbook: he would kick up his feet and talk at me anyway. No matter how many times I turned down his invitations, he just kept repeating them. I knew that Brett didn't need a friend\u2013just an audience\u2013but the companionship was nice all the same.\n\nNow Brett was polishing off a bottle of gin and breaking it against his head, for reasons that could only have made sense in Brett-land. I was amazed by how much the guy could drink, and that night\u2013on our walk back from the party\u2013I finally worked up the nerve to ask him what his secret was.\u00a0\n\n*It\u2019s a gift,* Brett said with a wink. Seeing the blank expression on my face, he paused beneath a streetlight and stared. *You really don\u2019t know, do you? You\u2019ve never heard about the Gift-Giver!* It sounded like the start of a bad joke, but Brett was completely serious. The wind blew dead, crackling leaves across the lonely night time street as my roommate began his story.\n\nAccording to Brett\u2019s grandfather, who had been the first in his family to attend our university, the Gift-Giver legend was as old as the campus itself. He only appeared between midnight and dawn, and even then, he only showed himself to students who were struggling through some kind of problem alone.\u00a0\n\nBrett claimed to have met the Gift-Giver while puking into a trash can beside the rec center: the only problem on his mind that night had been wishing that he could drink as much alcohol as he wanted with no consequences afterward. Dimly aware of a presence beside him, he had turned his head sideways and spotted a pair of shiny black shoes. After standing there silently for a long moment, the owner of the old-fashioned footwear had told Brett that what he was looking for was in the top drawer of his desk. When he checked later, he found a container of tiny red pills that hadn\u2019t been there before. If he took one before a night out, Brett said, it didn\u2019t matter how much he drank: all he would feel was a pleasant, consequence-free buzz.\n\nBreaking down Brett's story, it sounded to me like what had *really* happened was that my roommate had met a pill dealer while on a bender, wandered home blackout, and filled in the gaps in his memory with his grandfather\u2019s tall tale. Only one part of the story made sense: faced with an offer of anything that a person could wish for, it was just like Brett Harrison the Third to request a cure for a hangover. When I asked him what the Gift-Giver had wanted in return, however, he just squinted at me: *it was a gift, right? Aren\u2019t gifts supposed to be free?*\n\nA few minutes later, Brett spotted some girls he knew and jogged across the street to talk to them, leaving me to finish the walk back to our dorm alone. I didn't blame him: if I had his confidence, I would have probably done the same thing.Strolling toward campus with my hands stuffed in my pockets, I couldn't help but wonder about the Gift-Giver. *If I ran into him now, what would I ask for?* I didn't have a clear answer to my own question\u2013not then, anyway.\n\nI started partying with Brett more and more after that night. I told myself that I was finally coming out of my shell, but the real reasons were more complicated than that. It was my junior year, and classes were tougher than ever. My grades were slipping, and the only way that I could pretend that things were going to be alright was by ignoring them completely.\n\nWhen I finally dared to look, it was worse than I had imagined. I was at risk of losing my scholarship, and unlike Brett, I didn't have a millionaire family whose donations guaranteed that I would graduate. It wasn't just that I was going to fail out of school: it was that my parents\u2019 sacrifice--\n\nAnd everything that I had given up to meet their expectations\u2013\n\nIt was all going to have been for nothing.\n\nThe only way that I could turn things around was by achieving a 97% or higher on the end-of-course exam. The problem was, I doubted I would even be able to pass the test, much less earn a near-perfect score. Soon, not even Brett\u2019s parties were enough to make me forget what was coming.\u00a0\n\nI began going for long walks alone at night, barely paying attention to the weather, my surroundings, or even where I was going. I wandered through silent parking lots and between lightless buildings, discovering parts of campus that I never knew existed\u2026and that was how I finally met the Gift-Giver.\n\nAs the cold intensified, I had taken to bringing a thermos of hot coffee with me on my walks. That night, I stopped on a bench behind the university\u2019s power plant to take a few sips. Why there was a bench between a chain-link fence and some undeveloped woods was a mystery, but it felt like as good a place as any for a rest.\n\nI was about to continue my walk when I noticed someone standing at the corner of the fence. Backlit by the power plant\u2019s lights, I couldn't make out their features: only an old-fashioned umbrella, a baggy gray suit\u2026and a pair of polished black shoes.\n\nThe figure lurched toward me with an uneven gait, limping as though they had been crippled by some terrible accident. Rather than feeling sympathetic, however, I was suddenly afraid: I looked at the ground, hoping that the stranger would pass by\u2013\n\nBut he sat down beside me instead.\n\nSomehow, he had crossed the distance between us in only a few seconds. I kept my eyes down, a gut instinct warning me that if I looked at the stranger\u2019s face, I might not like what I saw.\n\n*Stay away from your exam on Friday,* he whispered, in a guttural voice that made my hair stand on end. *If you don\u2019t go, your score will be the best in your class. I guarantee it.* Before I could respond, he pushed himself painfully back to his feet and hobbled away into the darkness. The whole encounter couldn\u2019t have lasted more than two minutes, and when it was over, I found myself questioning whether it had ever happened at all. *Was this what going crazy felt like?*\u00a0\n\nMy exam was just two days away, and I spent every waking minute of them agonizing over what I should do. Part of me was convinced that I had actually met the Gift-Giver, but another part was sure that the whole thing had just been a hallucination brought on by stress. At four AM on the morning of the test, I groaned, rolled over in bed, and switched off my alarm. *The hell with it,* I thought. *I was going to fail anyway, so why not give the Gift-Giver a chance to work his magic?*\n\nI woke up twenty minutes before the exam was scheduled to start, and with nothing better to do, I strolled to the dining hall for a late breakfast. On the way, I ran into Brett. He scratched his head when he saw me: *didn't I have an exam this morning?*\n\nI gave him a wink. *The Gift-Giver was taking care of it,* I said. Brett went pale: I had never seen him look so serious. He put his hand on my shoulder. *You need to get to your test,* he whispered.\u00a0\n\nI ran. I ran even though I didn't know why I was running\u2013even though I was probably already too late. *Had Brett been trying to tell me that his story was bullshit, or was there something more sinister behind his words? Had his own \u2018gift\u2019 gone wrong somehow?* There was no time to think it over: I arrived on the second floor of the Science Building with my heels skidding on the hallway tiles, just in time to watch all sixteen of my classmates file into the exam room.\u00a0\n\n*Wait. Sixteen?!*\n\nThere were sixteen people in my Organic Chemistry III class\u2026*including me.* There was something odd about the guy standing in the shadows at the end of the line, but I didn\u2019t believe it until he stepped into the light.\n\nHe was\u2026*me.* A perfect copy. Our identical eyes met and his mouth stretched into a too-wide, wicked smile.\n\nMy jaw dropped. Before I could react, my duplicate had entered the exam room. The door was locked; the test was about to begin. Its results, however, were suddenly the last thing on my mind. I needed to find Brett. I needed to know what the hell was going on.\n\nBrett wasn\u2019t in the dining hall where I\u2019d left him, or in the rec center where he usually spent Friday mornings, knocking a ping\u2013pong ball around and swapping stories with his fraternity brothers. Our dorm room was the last place I considered checking, and by the time I entered the lobby, over two hours had passed. For better or worse, the exam was over.\n\nLydia, the front desk worker, stood up as I approached the stairs; I saw her every Friday, yet for some reason she suddenly wanted to inspect my student I.D. I fished my wallet out of my pocket and held it out to her; she examined the plastic card, suspicious.\n\n*Sir,* she informed me, *this I.D. expired in 1997. Dorms are for current students only. I\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave.* Her hand inched toward the phone on her desk. She was afraid of me, I realized; she was getting ready to call security! While I backed away, doing my best to look non-threatening, I glanced down at my I.D.\n\nI didn\u2019t recognize anything about the person I saw. Not the blurry photo, the date of birth, the address\u2013nothing. That wasn\u2019t all: my hands, too, were different. *How could I have overlooked it before?!* They were tanned and hairy, with bitten-off nails and a worm-like white scar that I couldn\u2019t remember ever getting.\n\nI rushed to the nearest public restroom I knew of, the one on the first floor of the Student Services Building. Even though I already suspected what I would find when I looked into the mirror, the shock of it was so great that I nearly passed out. I gripped the edges of the sink, staring helplessly at the reflection of a complete stranger.\u00a0\n\n*Who was I?*\u00a0\n\n*And who\u2013or what\u2013had taken my place?*\n\nThere was a computer lab near the lobby: even if my physical identity had been stolen, I still had my login information, and I could use it to research the person who I had somehow become. I punched in the data from the stranger\u2019s student I.D.\u00a0\n\n*Terrance Whitt.*\u00a0\n\n*Born: July Eighth, 1976.*\u00a0\n\n*Billing Address: Nashville, Tennessee.*\n\nIt was immediately clear to me that Terrance Whitt was a missing person. He had been twenty-one years old when he\u2019d vanished from the university library one foggy spring night. The security cameras had captured Terrance entering the building, but not leaving it, and online forums I read were full of strangers speculating about what might have happened.\n\nSome suspected that he had gotten lost in the library\u2019s maze-like basement\u2013which was under construction at the time\u2013and that his corpse had been entombed in its walls; others argued that Terrance must have been deep into the university\u2019s drug culture and had wound up owing money to the wrong people.\n\nI had my own theory about why Terrance Whitt had gone missing\u2026and it had *everything* to do with the Gift-Giver. I looked down at Terrance\u2019s face\u2013*my face*\u2013on the worn-out college I.D.\u00a0\n\n*Terrance\u2026you poor bastard\u2026what gift were you after?*\n\nThe Whitts had posted a phone number for tips or information about their son\u2019s disappearance, and even though the website hadn\u2019t been updated since the early 2000\u2019s, I figured I didn\u2019t have anything to lose by calling it.\u00a0\n\nI was shocked when someone picked up on the third ring.\n\nThe old woman on the other end of the line was Terrance\u2019s mother, and she had kept the number open even after all these years. I sputtered, suddenly remembering that I needed to provide information of my own before I asked any questions. I quickly asked if Terrance had a small white scar on his left hand. His mother\u2019s response was so hopeful and excited it hurt. *Yes!* She shouted. *Have you seen him?*\n\nI told her that I thought I *might* have, but I needed to know something first: did she have any idea about why her son might have wanted to disappear? Anything that was bothering him at the time?\n\n*You know,* Mrs. Whitt said finally, *you\u2019re the first person to call this number in over thirteen years. I suppose there\u2019s no harm in telling you. Terrance\u2026didn\u2019t want to leave that university. He wanted to stay in school and finish his PhD, but my husband\u2013God rest his soul\u2013demanded that he come home to take over the family business. You\u2026you don\u2019t think that could have anything to do with his disappearance\u2026do you?*\n\nI muttered that I had to go, that I would call back when I knew more. Mrs. Whitt\u2019s voice was still ringing in my ears, and I could already imagine how it might have gone:\n\n*Terrance, bitter and disillusioned, is roaming aimlessly through the library. There\u2019s hardly anyone here this late at night. The fluorescent lights hum overhead. The ugly gray carpet muffles his footsteps.*\n\n*Someone clears their throat on the other side of the shelves.*\u00a0\n\n*A stranger\u2019s voice whispers to him through a gap in the books.*\n\n*It tells Terrance that he can stay at the university after all, if only he follows a few simple instructions.*\u00a0\n\n*Wouldn\u2019t that be a lovely gift?*\n\nA security guard was watching me suspiciously through the computer lab windows. As he muttered something into his radio, I hurried out the back entrance. I headed for the park at the center of the university: I didn\u2019t *think* that campus police were actively searching for me, but if they were, it would be a good place to lose them.\u00a0\n\nThe park was a bowl-shaped ravine crisscrossed by paths, most of them half-hidden by bushes, rows of gnarled old trees, and the walls of a large amphitheater. The leaves had fallen weeks ago, but there was still enough cover to pass by unobserved\u2026I hoped.\n\nThis late on a Friday afternoon, the park was almost completely empty. On a bench up ahead, however, I spotted two figures: a boy and a girl. Their heads were pressed together as though they were having an intimate conversation, but the closer I got, the more wrong the situation looked. The girl leaned her body nervously away from the boy, who had a white-knuckle grip on her wrist. He was holding her in place, and while I wasn\u2019t sure what he was muttering into her ear, it was clear that she didn\u2019t like it.\n\nWhen I saw the boy\u2019s face, I understood that no matter how much time passed, I would never get used to the feeling of seeing my own body under something else\u2019s control. With horror, I realized that I recognized the girl as well: Raquel. I had had a crush on her since Freshman year, but had never worked up the courage to talk to her.\u00a0\n\n*Just think about what will happen if you refuse,* my duplicate hissed into her ear. *What would your parents think if they found out? You don\u2019t want me as your enemy\u2026*\n\nI forced myself to stop and ask the couple if everything was alright. My own face glared angrily up at me and for a second, and I would have sworn that my duplicate\u2019s eyes went inky black. It was like staring into two lightless pits, and from the way Raquel screamed, I was sure that she had seen it, too.\n\n*Get away from me, you freak!* She shouted, then fled down the trail. My duplicate stood, cracked its neck\u2026then punched me in the stomach.\u00a0\n\nThe wind went out of my lungs. I doubled over in the damp grass, gasping for air. My duplicate knelt beside me and pressed my face into the dirt.\u00a0\n\n*This is my life now, MINE, and you\u2019re never getting it back. Understand?*\n\nIt snarled. I couldn\u2019t breathe. My mouth filled with the reek of mud and rotting leaves\u2026\u00a0\n\n*HEY!* Someone shouted, and the weight on my back disappeared. Running footsteps approached; I spat black muck into the grass.\n\nIt was the security guard from the Student Services Building. The bulky older man hauled me to my feet, dusted me off, and asked if I was alright. Once he\u2019d confirmed that I wasn\u2019t going to die in his custody, he pointed to the parking lot that marked the edge of the university.\n\n*I\u2019ve had my eye on you for a while,* he grunted. *You\u2019ve been nothing but trouble ever since you showed up, and if I see you around here again I\u00b4m gonna detain you for trespassing. Are we clear?*\u00a0\n\nI nodded; I didn\u2019t have much choice.\n\nWith no money and no way of proving who I really was, I could only wander the chilly, gray streets until sunset. Around twilight, the sound of wailing sirens made me look toward the liquor store at the edge of campus. A red-faced, bellowing student was being dragged through its doors by four police officers. *It was Brett!*\u00a0\n\nBy the time I'd jogged up to the liquor store, my roommate had already been taken away. The store owner and a cashier were still outside, having a smoke and shaking their heads. With a sinking feeling in my gut, I approached and asked them what had happened. The owner\u2013a grizzled old man in a white apron\u2013said that he had never seen anything like it.\n\nApparently, Brett had stumbled into the store fifteen minutes earlier, rambling about how he needed *\u2018more.\u2019* He had unscrewed a bottle of whiskey, chugged it, and then did the same to the next one. By the time the cashier realized what was going on, Brett had polished off five without a single sign of drunkenness. When the owner tried to stop him, he shattered a bottle and threatened them with its jagged edges\u2026and *still* he kept drinking. Even after the police tackled and cuffed him, Brett was still fighting to lick a few last drops of alcohol from the floor. His tongue, shredded by broken glass, had left a bloody smear across the filthy tiles.\n\nIf Brett died on the way to the hospital, it would probably be attributed to alcohol poisoning, but I knew better. His *\u2018gift,\u2019* like mine and Terrance\u2019s, was\u00a0 twisted from the beginning. He may have wanted a cool party trick, but what he had gotten was something dangerous, something that had to be *fed.* I felt certain that if Brett couldn't feed his gift, it would consume him instead. *And what about my so-called \u2018gift\u2019? What was my duplicate using my name and my body to do, even now?*\n\nSomehow, I had to find the Gift-Giver for a second time.\n\nI returned to campus under cover of darkness, and by two AM, I had circled the entire university three times. My legs ached, my eyelids were heavy, and I could see my breath in the frosty air. I was halfway through a parking-lot underpass when I heard the tap of an umbrella on the concrete behind me. I turned slowly, and in the yellowish glow of the underpass\u2019 solitary light, I saw the Gift-Giver face-to-face for the first time.\n\nWhere his eyes, ears, and nose should have been were only empty pits. His awkward movements, I realized, were caused by his bent-backwards limbs. Even so, he was fast: faster than should have been possible. The light flickered, I blinked, and suddenly his face was mere inches from mine.\u00a0\n\n*What's wrong?* He rasped through graying, empty gums. *You don't like your gift?*\n\nI bit down a scream; the Gift-Giver made a horrible gurgling noise that might have been a giggle. *You can give it back, you know. As long as you do a favor for me in return\u2026*\n\nForcing my lips to move again, I asked the Gift-Giver what he wanted.\u00a0\n\n*Oh, that's easy. I want you to kill me.*\n\nMy jaw dropped.\u00a0\n\n*See that concrete brick over there? Smash it into my skull. Again and again and again, until there's nothing left. Do that, and your duplicate will disappear. You\u2019ll be yourself again. Do we have a deal?*\n\nI hesitated: the Gift-Giver was literally asking me to commit murder\u2026and what was the catch in his new offer? Would I get my body back, only to spend the rest of my days rotting in prison? Or would the consequences of returning my gift be something even worse, something unimaginable?\n\nI thought about spending the rest of my days in Terrence Whitt's body, forced to do nothing but watch while my duplicate committed horrors using my name, my face, and my reputation. I thought about my parents, about the padded cell where I would be locked up if I ever tried to tell anyone the truth. Nothing could be worse than that\u2026*could it?*\n\nI could see the brick the Gift-Giver was talking about, surrounded by slimy puddles and trash. It seemed to have its own gravity\u2026it seemed to be calling to me. I swallowed; my throat was dry. I told the Gift-Giver to turn around.\n\nI lifted the brick in my hand and took a deep breath. As long as I didn\u2019t think about what I was doing, it was no different than hammering in a nail or tenderizing a slab of meat. The Gift-Giver had *asked* me to do this, I reminded myself\u2026and then I swung.\n\nHe went down the moment the sharp edge cracked against his skull, but I didn\u2019t stop. I shut my eyes tight, gritted my teeth, and smashed the brick into his head until I didn\u2019t have the strength to lift it anymore. A sick burbling sound made me look down.\n\nThe Gift-Giver was\u2026*laughing*\u2026and that wasn\u2019t all. Something was moving beneath his skin. No, that wasn\u2019t right: his flesh itself was changing, reshaping itself into the form of someone else. Someone who I thought I recognized. I rolled the Gift-Giver\u2019s corpse over with the tip of my shoe\u2026 and looked down at the ruined face of Terrance Whitt.\u00a0\n\nIt didn't make sense. *If Terrance Whitt had been the Gift-Giver all along, then where had the legend come from?*\n\nSomewhere in the distance, a dog barked. Terrance Whitt\u2019s body was a gory mess, I was holding the murder weapon, and a witness could come along at any time. What mattered now was distancing myself from the scene and washing away the evidence. The bloodstains weren\u2019t obvious on my dark jacket; they could have been anything\u2026and I had my doubts that the stuff was even blood at all. The oily black liquid that had splattered from the Gift-Giver\u2019s wound was thick and viscous; it seemed to sink into my clothes and skin rather than dripping off of them. With a shudder, I wiped away what I could and hurried back to my dorm.\n\nFifteen minutes later, I was crossing the threshold of the lobby. It felt like a moment of truth. Behind the front desk, Lydia looked up from her computer and gave me a small smile. *She had recognized me!* It was all the proof I needed that I was truly myself again.\n\nI left my filthy clothes on the floor of my room, wrapped up in a towel, and hurried down the hallway to the bathroom. The communal showers always smelled like mold, bleach, and too much cologne, but that night, they felt like heaven. Beneath the hot water, I felt reborn. Tomorrow would be a new day. I could finally put this nightmare behind me.\n\nMy confidence lasted only as long as it took me to dry off, change into my pajamas, and return to my lightless dorm room. The clothes that I had piled on the floor were gone. In their place was a gray silk suit, a black umbrella, and a pair of polished shoes. I clamped a hand over my mouth. I felt a tooth wiggle loose, and then fall out.

The tumors had spread like spiderwebs across my liver. They gave me timelines wrapped in soft words: \u201cpalliative,\u201d \u201ccomfort,\u201d \u201cmaking the most of your time.\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t ready. I was only thirty-five. No children. No family. No legacy. And something more selfish than that\u2026 I wanted more time. Desperately.\n\nWhen my grandmother passed away at 101, I took over her house. There was no question. She\u2019d always been a little odd, in ways I never fully understood. I was her only granddaughter, and she treated me like I was precious. Like I was the last of something important.\n\nShe\u2019d been obsessed with the strange. Bundles of herbs hung drying from her rafters; she burned them at dusk. Sometimes I would glimpse her through a cracked door, muttering in languages I didn\u2019t recognize. Charms of feathers, bones, and stones always hung from her neck, clacking softly as she moved. She had a way of looking through you, her gaze heavy as iron, making you feel stripped bare. And above all, there were the books.\n\nAlways unmarked, leather-bound tomes. It didn\u2019t seem odd at first\u2014until the day I passed behind her chair while she read. The pages were filled with symbols, jagged and crawling, interspersed with broken Latin and scattered Old English I could barely decipher. Those books never made it back to the shelves. Only one ever resurfaced.\n\nI found it in the attic a month after she had passed.\n\nThe attic smelled of dust and something faintly metallic, like old pennies left too long in the rain. Pale light barely reached the corners, where shadows crouched thick and stubborn. When I lifted the quilt she\u2019d woven herself, a puff of stale air escaped, cold as breath. Beneath it sat a small cedar box, its hinges dark with age.\n\nInside, old papers were bound in cracked leather, the edges yellowed and curling. It smelled of smoke\u2014but not fire. Something older. The ink on the pages was darker than black, glistening wet though they were dry. And when I looked too long at the symbols, they writhed, curling like ash in an unseen breeze.\n\nOn the third page, words I could read emerged:\n\n*The Cord Ritual*.\n\nMore followed.\n\nIt was simple. Ten knots. Each tied with intention. Each knot a year of life, stolen from the waiting mouth of death. The price? A small sacrifice. The first knot was clich\u00e9: a drop of blood. Harmless. But the price climbed. The more you took, the more you had to give. Memories. Essence. Pieces of yourself.\n\nNot long into my doctor visits, I remembered the old book. I reclaimed it.\n\nI didn\u2019t hesitate. I was dying.\n\nThe first knot was easy\u2014a drop of blood.\n\nThe next day, I felt better. Not just better\u2014alive. Strong. The pain in my side faded. The yellow fled from my eyes. I called my doctors. They were shocked. Spontaneous remission, they said. But I knew. I knew what I had done.\n\nSo I kept tying the knots. One a year, always on the same night. Each year, I gave a little more.\n\nThe second knot: a strand of hair. I plucked the awkward one that never lay flat. It never grew back.\n\nThe third: a fingernail. It slipped off cleanly, as if the knot itself had loosened it.\n\nThe fourth: a tooth. Same thing. No pain. I felt invincible. I\u2019d reached thirty-eight.\n\nThe fifth: an important memory. I couldn\u2019t recall exactly what went missing\u2014only that, when I thought of my grandmother\u2019s passing, something felt hollow. I remember being distraught about it. Then\u2026 I moved on.\n\nThe sixth: my reflection. Nobody seemed to notice. Maybe it only affected me. When I looked into mirrors, all I saw was a blurred absence, a ripple in glass.\n\nThe seventh: my shadow. Strange, yes. But every year past thirty-eight was a gift, even if I wasn\u2019t whole.\n\nThe eighth: a hope. An ambition. This was the moment I knew I wouldn\u2019t last beyond the tenth knot. That night, as I tied it, I realized: my hopes for the future were gone. I couldn\u2019t even imagine a tomorrow.\n\nBy the ninth knot, I stopped dreaming. Or perhaps\u2026 the dreams weren\u2019t mine anymore. Shadows pressed close in sleep. Whispers crawled beneath the surface. When I woke, I could still hear them calling, faint and distant, like voices rising from deep water.\n\nAnd then came the tenth knot.\n\nThe price wasn\u2019t a piece of me. This time, it demanded something I loved. And the only thing I had left was Lilly, my cat. She was old, frail, always curling beside me like a warm heartbeat. She had been with me through everything.\n\nI tied the tenth knot, whispered her name, and carried her gently to her bed.\n\nShe didn\u2019t wake the next morning.\n\nBut neither did I die.\n\nNot on time, anyway.\n\nI thought I had won. I thought I had outwitted death. Bought more time, like always.\n\nUntil today.\n\nI stood at my bedroom doorway, staring down the hallway.\n\nAnd saw him.\n\nA man\u2014or something like one\u2014standing still in the shadows. I couldn\u2019t see his face, only the weight of his presence pressing down on the air. He wasn\u2019t standing in the dark; he *was* the dark. The shadows bent toward him, siphoning like smoke into his shape.\n\nWhen I moved, he stayed. When I spoke, he gave no answer.\n\nAnd then, he lifted a bony finger and pointed\u2014slowly, deliberately, down the hall, over my shoulder\u2014 at the drawer beside my bed.\n\nMy heart sank.\n\nThe cord lay coiled inside.\n\nThe tenth loop unraveled before my eyes.\n\nA meow sounded from downstairs. *Lilly*.\n\nAnd then: footsteps.\n\nSoft. Barefoot. Growing closer.\n\nAn hour later, the ninth knot unraveled.\n\nHe stepped forward.\n\nBy the time the sixth knot came undone, I glimpsed myself in the mirror. The reflection was back\u2014but I didn\u2019t recognize her. My hair had thinned, my skin bruised with sickly yellows and grays. Parts of me flaked, crumbling like old parchment. I was rotting.\n\nHe was in the doorway now.\n\nThe fifth knot has just slipped free.\n\nAnd now I remember. My memory.\n\nMy grandmother, on her deathbed. Frail. Sunken into the mattress. Pointing a trembling finger toward the corner of the hospital room, her voice hoarse with terror:\n\n\u201cTell him to leave.\u201d Her lips cracked. \u201cHe can\u2019t have me yet.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019d been nothing there then. Only a patch of shadow, thick as ink.\n\nI thought I had beaten death.\n\nBut I hadn\u2019t.\n\nI only borrowed time.\n\nAnd Death, it turns out, never forgets.\n\nI only have a few hours left, opposed to the year I thought I had. If you\u2019re reading this, will one of you please visit my home, and take Lilly? Tell her I\u2019m sorry. Give her more love in her final years than I did.\n\nI don\u2019t want her to spend the rest of her time waiting\u2026 watching\u2026 worrying the way that I did.\n\n"},"45":{"title":"My Old Man And The Sea","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1ki4lhy\/my_old_man_and_the_sea\/","flair":null,"author":"sandboy810","selftext":"This may be the tale of a fisherman but it is no fisherman\u2019s tale, I swear it.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFather was a white man from Whitby, Mother an Iqaluit Inuit, making me half-and-half. He was Henry Seaver, she was Aqakuktuk. Father promised mother their second child would bear an Inuqtitut name, but she passed on in the womb, making me Henry Seaver II, sole descendent of Henry Seaver I and the only one left to pass on our story.\n\n\n\nFather was a fisherman, but don\u2019t be mistaken; even back then we\u2019d long since lay down our spears for rods, our harpoons for rifles, and our weirs for nets. For father, fishing was little more than puttering about adeck a trawler in his bone dry waders, yet the sea and that which lurked within ensnared his heart as nothing else.\n\n\n\nIn my very soul I *know* that I last saw my father aboard the vessel, hunched over the railing in his woolen cap, gaze lost on the horizon. As I waved, father didn\u2019t even look back; his eyes only lingered on the sea. The motor roared to life, and with the thunderous crack of ice father vanished into the mist.\n\n\n\nThere were no storms. The sea was calm. Yet not a man aboard that vessel would return.\u00a0\n\n\n\nExcept, that is, for \u2018father\u2019.\n\n\n\n\u2018Father\u2019 came to our home years later, when father had become naught more than a bittersweet memory. Mother threw her arms around him, but \u2018father\u2019 did not for \u2018father\u2019 knew not who she was. \u2018Father\u2019 placed one arm at her back and over her shoulder his sullen eyes bore into mine as he claimed he was suffering from a most horrible bout of amnesia and, try as he might, he couldn\u2019t remember a thing save for his name- stitched upon his slicker, though the portmaster had been so kind as to remind him of his home address.\n\n\n\nConcerned as she was, mother was happy to welcome \u2018father\u2019 in and provide him a hot meal so as to fix his sallow complexion. Mother pranced to the kitchen as \u2018father\u2019 and I took our seats at the table.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI did not say a word, nor did \u2018father\u2019 utter a word to me. I didn\u2019t speak for I was so petrified I could not; \u2018father\u2019 didn\u2019t speak perhaps because he simply would not. Silence fell over the room, and- I swear this- I began to hear a sound I first believed to be the din howl of the moaning winds. But no, I swear I had heard the crashing of waves in that very room, and \u2018father\u2019, as though transfixed, allowed his head to lull side to side as if tossed about amidst the foam.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMother prepared father\u2019s favourite: dishes of cod, sculpin, and elk. Of the fish \u2018father\u2019 ate with a never before seen ferocity, as though he feared were he to stop eating for even a moment his meal may vanish into thin air. I was horrified by the vile manner in which \u2018father\u2019 shovelled the meat and stew into his craw, adorned with a glistening coat of slobber and saliva, but mother was overjoyed to see \u2018father\u2019 eat so readily, and when he had finished his fish she politely slid a wooden bowl of roast elk before him with a smile.\n\n\n\nBut \u2018Father\u2019 didn\u2019t dare touch it. His prior vigor seemed to drain from his body as he gazed down at the meat before him, and after a moment\u2019s quiet began to convulse with such force I had worried he may regurgitate all his insides.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMother and I watched in horror as \u2018father\u2019 swept his arm across the table sending the dishes clattering to the floor, his once-sullen eyes now bulging and bursting at the seams, slipping and popping from his sockets. Mother shrieked as \u2018father\u2019 clamped his hand over his mouth and tried again and again to squeeze his eyeballs back into place as a pale grey fluid began draining from his ears as though he were leaking seawater and his neck began to flex and slither and pulse as though a great eel slithered about within him.\n\n\n\nMother grabbed me by the wrist and pulled me from the house, not stopping until we\u2019d reached the hut of an angakkuit. A matter of great urgency, the angakkuit ran alongside us as mother dragged me, now kicking and screaming, back to the house- back to \u2018father\u2019.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBut \u2018father\u2019 was no longer home, leaving behind only a shallow pool of foamy liquid where he once sat and a line of frantic footsteps heading towards the harbour. Some may call it folly but we followed, and by the sea we found \u2018father\u2019 kneeling in the snow.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u2018Father\u2019 glared back at us, and before him I could see, as though a scene from a most horrid nightmare, that cast along the shore, in the frigid water, bumping against the ice, were hundreds, *thousands*, of father\u2019s lifeless bodies as though they\u2019d been spat up from the freezing depths and drifted ashore, all of them with their faces to the sky, mouth agape as though in the most horrible agony imaginable.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSilence followed. \u2018Father\u2019 chokingly rasped out to my mother in Inuktitut but I understood naught but the words \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d as mother always made me recite them when I\u2019d misbehaved. Mother gasped. \u2018Father\u2019 then faced the angakkuit and once more spoke Inuktitut, who nodded solemnly, said something back, and waved him away, saying \u201cGo now, go now, return.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u2018Father\u2019 rose to his feet, turned towards the sea, and waded into the icy waters until even his head had sunk into the darkness, and with him the shoal of terrified figures receded forever into the depths.\n\n\n\nNever again did I see \u2018father\u2019, nor shall I ever see my father again. It has been years now since mother passed and yet I remain in our house, her very inuksuit in plain view of my window. Never shall I leave, either. If I stray, I begin hearing the nauseating crashing of waves, \u2018father\u2019s waves, growing and swelling ever more until I return to her, the sea, too frightened now to embrace her, too frightened now to abandon her. Thus between I remain, here I remain, and as the last of my line, I must here tell you my story.\n\n  \n  \n"},"46":{"title":"Do any of you remember Earday? Its a week day that everyone forgots.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1ki5hdi\/do_any_of_you_remember_earday_its_a_week_day_that\/","flair":null,"author":"Extension_Function94","selftext":"No? Yea I didn't think so. I usually forget it myself if I don't go through my mnemonic routines trying to remember my daily necessities. This might seem like an insane statement if you don't personally know me. But all you need to know about the subject is that I started taking notes and daily rereading and forcefully memorizing them in order to combat a brain injury that thankfully healed years ago. But old habits die hard. But this \\*\\*Post\\*\\* is not about that.\n\nFirst of all. After going through these mnemonics. I stumbled around an event That was completely necessary for me to attend(lets say meeting a friend). It was planned to occur at this odd day called Earday. From what I wrote about it. The date matches in the calendar what Thursday would have been at the same time. When I recheck my calendar the event never existed in that time and I have a similar engagement in a completely different date. (I am keeping the details obscure to protect my privacy).\n\nAs if I accidentally signed up to something twice. That is if I believe my notebook over my calendar. Anyone else would have chalked it up to a brain fart or something similar. This doubt would have been with me, if it wasn't for some memories returning the longer I meditate on that day and what I did in it.\n\nYou might be wondering why I don't just leave it and move on. 'You just miss wrote something its okay'. But you don't know me. I live in an incredibly structured frame of reality. My understanding of all I believe to be real and objective truth is written down in my notebook, I don't write down my thoughts and daydreams in this book. Its sole existence is based on this truth and its just been proven false. I won't be able to trust the validity of the topics I write down in my notebook in the 100% range I usually  assume. I would not be as comfortable depending on it as I did before.\n\nMy tactics of retracing actions and attempting to manually remember every event has eliminated the chance of misremembering events and occasions. I restructured my life for such a thing to rarely happen to me if it ever even happens. Feeling the sense of losing a memory is traumatic to me and makes me dwell on this feeling of casually forgetting\/imagining\/hallucinating something that may or may not happen.\n\nIn my notebook. The very first occurrence of the name of this odd weekday was 4 months ago. It was written as if I was having trouble in remembering that I need to do something at that day and was constantly struggling to commit it to memory. As if it was actively being wiped from all of existence while I was actively remembering it and my memorization process took long enough for my memory of a memory of the word to have survived what ever spell a cosmic horror casted to wipe it out of all our collective consciousness and material references.\n\nThis would have been just an interesting peculiarity. If it was just a name for a retired weekday and all calendars collapsed their days from 8 to 7 days. But from what I observed in my research. The weekday Earday(through research i found out it means (Earth's day, Old English \"Eor\u00fee\")) was not wiped from existence. We are all still existing when it passes. Its just that we never seem to remember it.\n\nThis realization shook me to my core. What is happening in these days and why does it seem like there are never any material effects to our normal days. Our finances, The food in our fridge and literally any other material effect that could be observed.\n\nWell I have figured out a bit of the mechanisms. But it would be easier for me to just flow all my discoveries in a queue of surprises to you. So you stay engaged and so you wont forget what you are actively reading in this moment. (if you notice, that you have not followed this post properly. Please use one of my favorite memorization tactics to combat mental fog. Every time you read one new word, reread all preceding words from the beginning until the next new word. You will deeply memorize all the text you read from now on. For this subject you might have to restart this process multiple times).\n\nSo lets start before I believed Earday was a real weekday. At that time my attempts at trying to remember these enigmatic days was wasted on tangents and real life responsibilities. At this point I have been pulling hair trying to figure out. Why I seem to have miss remembered such an important event months ago. Even though the event occurred and passed in a different date. I was still obsessing with the oddity of the subject.\n\nThrough days of research and back tracing all my activities. I memorized all interlinked events and heavily focused on oddities. Through this I discovered that this misremembering is systemic and Every time it occurs, its between Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nAfter becoming hyper aware. For the first time I actually remembered what happened when it was Earday. I woke up that day wrote down a paragraph or three of my current research of Earday as if i was not even living it and went through my normal routine. Ate, brushed and left for work. My work day was normal. But everything i typed in my computer screen was gibberish.\n\nMy boss and colleagues were discussing meetings about nonsense topics. Such as \"Scandinavian names that rhyme with Margret\"  and \"Deconstructing the office furniture to lower global warming\" I promise this is not a normal topic that is acceptable in my job.\n\nFrom an outside perspective these all seem like normal activities everyone is just doing. When you recall the passed event. But when you actually try to remember what the actual substance of any of these topics that might have been discussed you draw a blank. I would have pointed out more stuff of that day. But i actually forgot most of it and these tidbits are the tiny fragments that passed through.\n\nEventually It becomes easier to remember. When you commit it to memory the day you wake up right in the start of Thursday and trying to remember what happened yesterday. You will be able to really drill them in and avoid the memory loss to a certain extent. And the amnesic effect is also weaker When you already know a lot like I am starting to. The more you know of what happens in these days, the more you remember.\n\nThe next week. I made another discovery. In Earday My wife made me a large apple pie. This would have been a normal statement. If only i was married. I don't even have a girlfriend. I don't know the woman, but I remember her fondly. This interloper in my life seems to have a comfortable and lazy relationship with me. As if we knew each other for many years.\n\nWe spoke nonsense to each other and I left for work and this time we had a team building exercise that happens once a month. I recall that this event already happened two days ago. So it seems like events get dislocated forwards and backwards in date relative to Earday.\n\nWhen I woke up. I had a vague recollect of the events and I instantly jolted awake and started writing down all events and observed objects. The more the better. I was confused multiple times by my dreams and my memory of yesterday. As they both occupied a similar level of haziness. And quickly leaving my mind. As if beasts bucking and fighting for an exit from my memory. I usually keep a detailed dream journal to make sure nothing is forgotten. But considering the magical situation currently. I will have to abandon this private tradition.\n\nWhat struck me the most from that dream was that my life situation actually differed from my reality. This strange woman occupied a position in my life that is impossible in reality. NOT because I cant get married. But I haven't yet and I was working under the assumption everyone just wakes up as zombies in those days. Every single person I have seen is a person that exists in my life normally. My neighbors and coworkers. Some people in transit that I often see go to work or school are there.\n\nBut who is this woman. I have no idea who she is and have never seen her before. She doesn't live in my house so how could I wake up to see her. Wait... Is she really not in this house.\n\nI sense a creeping foreboding in that moment. I slowly move to every closed door and open it. Terrified to see what could be a feeble tiny woman. Door 1.. check. The room is empty and there doesn't seem to be anything. Door 2.. check. The same as the last one.\n\nI continue this process for Door 3,Door 4, Door 5, etc.. I am relieved to see that there is no stranger in my sanctuary. Sorry for frighting you. I am just trying to convey the fear I felt in that moment. Let me continue to explain my next discoveries.\n\nFor the next two weeks consecutively. They both now included this new entity called Wife(i don't know her name). My days at work were also the same as every other time. I submit my completed work each time with my normal writing at the start. But any work done after the day starts was filled with Gibberish. Its as if an angsty teen wrote half a report and got sick of it and padded the rest with junk. Hopping no one notices.\n\nWhats truly unique is that this is the point I realized the amnesic effect is weakening considerably. As if this forbidden knowledge got used to me and surrendered in its attempts to escape my mental vice trap. Allowing me to grasp even more of its body with each following attempt.\n\nThis next week was what truly spooked me to comprehend this is an unnatural state of the world. It is not a magical plane of existence that I discovered and can pioneer its reclamation to add more workdays for everyone. Maybe the reason no one can remember it. Is to protect them from observing this horror.\n\nWhen I woke up on Earday. My wife was crying, The amnesic effect was particularly high as I don't recollect anything except her weeping and then her death. I mourned and cried for her. I don't know what happened and any attempts on trying to recall draws a blank. Its really not in my head anymore. No matter what I could not remember anymore details of the morning. What was most upsetting was that I went to work that day and deep depression hugged me as I spent my work day typing out nonsense.\n\nEveryone was depressed. No one was happy in my work place. I could not really understand why everyone was so upset. Was what happened to me a universal event.\n\nWhen I woke up the next day in Thursday. I did the same as every week and wrote down everything as fast as possible. But this time it was different. I was actually depressed and sad. This is the first time anything from Earday passed to the next day.\n\nI went out into public and saw a seen of general gloom. people were sad and less smiling face were seen than Normal. Is this what seasonal sadness is. Something out of our realm of knowledge is taken away from us and the backlash it induces leaves us depressed.\n\nHow many unexplained mental illnesses come from these unknowable events that occur in a day that we all collectively forget.\n\nOr maybe we choose to forget.\n\nI will share my next discoveries in a later date, when the recollection of this event stops affecting me so badly. I still have 2 months of active research logs left. But I still want to gauge how many people are still able to hold the memory of Earday long enough to finish reading this whole post. Before I waste my time trying to teach it to more people that cant hold it in memory. Maybe I finally lost memory of Earday and these months of obsession just disappear.  Not even remembered as a bad dream."},"47":{"title":"I Found a Tooth in the Drain.

I ignored it for a few weeks\u2014assumed it was condensation or loose plumbing. The kind of thing you tell yourself you\u2019ll get around to fixing but never do.\n\nThen one morning, the drip stopped.\n\nInstead, there was a *clink.*\n\nA single sharp *ping* from inside the pipe. I figured something had come loose. Maybe a coin, a bit of tile, a piece of old rust.\n\nWhen I unscrewed the U-bend under the sink, water spilled out\u2014stale, grayish. And in the middle of it was a **tooth**.\n\nIt was yellowed, cracked, and slightly crooked. A molar. No fillings, but old. Worn down. The root was still attached.\n\nI stared at it for too long.\n\nI live alone. No one else has used that bathroom in months. No guests. No contractors. I even called my dentist the next day just to be sure\u2014no missing teeth, no hidden damage. Definitely not mine.\n\nI kept the tooth in a Ziploc bag. I told myself I was going to throw it out, but I didn\u2019t.\n\nThe next night, I woke up at 2:40 a.m. to the sound of dripping again. Except it wasn\u2019t the sink. It was heavier. Slower. Coming from the backyard.\n\nI looked out the window and saw nothing. No movement. No breeze. But the sound kept going\u2014like water hitting soil. A slow, thick *drip\u2026 drip\u2026 drip.*\n\nIn the morning, I checked outside.\n\nThere was a hole in the garden bed. Small, about the size of a mixing bowl. Freshly dug. Right under the bathroom window. The soil around it was damp. Like something had been buried\u2026 then pulled back out.\n\nThat\u2019s when I noticed something else.\n\nMy neighbour\u2014Rob\u2014had been acting strange for weeks. Nice guy, mid-40s, worked in plumbing. We\u2019d chatted maybe three times total. But since the tooth, he started watching me.\n\nNot staring. Just\u2026 always out front. Sweeping. Fixing his car. \u201cHappening\u201d to be there when I checked my mail or took out the bins. Once, I caught him looking directly at my house from his bedroom window. When I waved, he froze, then closed the curtain.\n\nThree days later, I found **another tooth.** This time in the kitchen sink.\n\nSmaller. Incisor. Clean, but clearly old.\n\nNow I was scared.\n\nI called the police\u2014not to report a crime, just to ask. I explained, awkwardly, that human teeth were showing up in my drains. The officer was polite but unconvinced. \u201cCould be anything. Old plumbing pulls weird stuff sometimes. Mice, even. You\u2019d be surprised.\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t. But I didn\u2019t argue. I just logged the call.\n\nThat night, I didn\u2019t sleep.\n\nAt 3:12 a.m., I heard it again. The clink. Then another. Faster.\n\nI turned the bathroom light on. The sink was dry. But when I opened the cabinet beneath, a trickle of water ran from the pipe\u2014and pooled around **five teeth**, all different. One was tiny. One had a metal pin in it.\n\nI bagged them and went next door.\n\nRob answered like he was expecting me.\n\n\u201cEverything alright, mate?\u201d he asked, drying his hands with a towel that had brownish stains.\n\nI tried to be calm. \u201cYou haven\u2019t had any\u2026 plumbing issues, have you?\u201d\n\nHe smiled. \u201cOnly upstream from yours.\u201d\n\nI asked what he meant, but he just gave a weird little wink and said, \u201cIt\u2019s all connected, isn\u2019t it? Pipes. People. Nerves. Doesn\u2019t take much to cross over.\u201d\n\nI left.\n\nI installed a motion-activated camera in the backyard that afternoon. I pointed it right at the garden bed under the window.\n\nI didn\u2019t check the footage until two days later.\n\nThere were 43 clips from the night before. Each was 10 to 12 seconds long. They all showed Rob\u2014standing in my backyard, completely still. Not digging. Not moving. Just staring up at my window. His hands at his sides. Sometimes, he tilted his head. Sometimes, he smiled.\n\nNot once did he walk in or out of frame.\n\nHe just appeared.\n\nAnd then, at 3:16 a.m., one clip showed him raising his hand and dropping something gently into the soil. The same hole as before.\n\nI ran outside. Dug up the spot with a trowel.\n\nI found a **tongue.** Dried, leathery, with the tip missing.\n\nI called the police again. This time, they came.\n\nThey knocked on Rob\u2019s door.\n\nNo answer.\n\nThey went inside.\n\nNothing. Empty house. No furniture. No clothes. Just a mattress on the floor and a single notebook. The fridge was full of teeth. Bags of them. Neatly labelled. Some dated back to the 1980s. None matched Rob\u2019s dental records\u2014because Rob wasn\u2019t Rob. The actual Rob disappeared nine months ago. His mail kept coming. His lawn kept getting mowed.\n\nI haven\u2019t slept properly in weeks.\n\nThe police don\u2019t know who the man was. The video clips disappeared off my drive before I could back them up. And yesterday, I found **a molar in my shower drain.** Not mine. Not old.\n\nStill bloody.\n\nThere was a note taped to my door this morning.\n\nWritten in black marker. All caps:\n\n**\"SINKS DRAIN. PEOPLE DON\u2019T.\"**\n\nIf something happens to me, remember this:\n\n**Check your pipes.**\n\nYou never know who they\u2019re connected to."},"48":{"title":"I'm A Receptionist at a Plastic Surgeon's: My Boss is Stalking me (Finale)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1khyez3\/im_a_receptionist_at_a_plastic_surgeons_my_boss\/","flair":"Series","author":"Voodoo_Clerk","selftext":"[Part 1](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k1ixan\/im_a_receptionist_at_a_plastic_surgeons_my_boss\/) [Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1k6ya6x\/im_a_receptionist_at_a_plastic_surgeons_my_boss\/) [Part 3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kcdvr4\/comment\/mqgox81\/?context=3) \n\nThe next thing I knew, I suddenly found myself back in bed. I sat up, but as I did, a sharp pain rang out from my stomach. And everything that had happened at the parking garage. Philip stabbing me, Dr. Harrison saving me. I looked down at myself and saw that I was still wearing my blood-stained sweater. I lifted my shirt and saw a scar staring back at me. Stitched up nice and neat and just slightly red.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI looked over to my nightstand and saw that a bottle of pills and a note had been left behind. I took the note and read it. \u2018Take if the pain gets too bad. Dr. Harrison. P.S. Sonny has been fed and has water.\u2019 I looked up from the letter, half expecting that Dr. Harrison would be standing there before me, but there wasn\u2019t anyone there. I sat up fully in bed with some difficulty and began to change my ruined and bloodstained sweater. It was probably the hardest time I\u2019ve ever had putting a shirt on, but I finally managed it.\u00a0\n\n\n\nExiting out into my apartment proper, I was surprised that nothing was out of place. And to my delight and relief, Sonny came waddling over to me and happily licked my toes. I didn\u2019t want to think about what Dr. Harrison was currently doing to Philip or to the fact that he had most likely once again broken into my apartment to place me back into my bed. All of that could be dealt with tomorrow, for now, I just wanted to sit down and rest with Sonny. I sat down on my comfy sofa with Sonny next to me and started to knit him another sweater.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe next morning, I woke up with a sharp pain in my stomach, so I took some of the pills to dull the pain and started to get ready for work. I probably should\u2019ve stayed home and rested, but I wanted to thank Dr. Harrison, and above all, I wanted to know what he had done with Phil. I sat in the parking lot of the clinic for a few minutes to try and gain some courage to go inside. Dr. Harrison had saved my life and had stopped Philip from killing me and doing who knows what else to me. But at the same time, he was still stalking me. The only reason he had known where I was going was because he had still followed me despite my threat against him.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe was my savior, but that didn\u2019t wash away everything he\u2019d been doing to me recently. Finally, with my head still swirling in thought about what to do next, I exited my car and walked to the clinic. As I opened the door, I was surprised to see that Dr. Harrison was talking to Wilson at the entrance. I had clearly caught both of them off guard.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cMaggie?! W-what are you doing here? You should be resting!\u201d Dr. Harrison quickly began to fuss, a look of concern on his face. Wilson, by contrast, was his usual happy self and eagerly waved hello at me. \u201cI was just telling Wilson that I wasn\u2019t going to open the clinic.\u201d I looked at Dr. Harrison, and it was obvious that he hadn\u2019t gotten a single hour of sleep since saving me from Philip\u2019s attack.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m here now, sir. And I might as well at least do the paperwork for today. Unless you\u2019re going to trust Wilson to do it?\u201d I motioned over to our security guard. Dr. Harrison took one look at him before sighing and nodding in defeat. He was exhausted and clearly wasn\u2019t in any mood to argue.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cFine, but don\u2019t work yourself too hard.\u201d He looked between the two of us before turning to leave. I fidgeted with the strap of my purse as I watched him leave. I reached my hand out and quickly grabbed him by his surgeon\u2019s coat sleeve. He stopped in his tracks and looked back at me.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cThank you. For saving me, James.\u201d I looked up at him and met those big green eyes of his. He stared at me for a moment, caught completely off guard. \u201cI\u2019m still angry at you for stalking me. But\u2026thank you for saving my life.\u201d I let go of his sleeve and walked past him to return to my reception desk. As I did so, I stopped in my tracks at the sound of a long, pained scream from one of the ORs.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cAh, he\u2019s awake,\u201d Dr. Harrison said with a low chuckle in his voice. I gripped my purse strap tightly as I figured who was most likely screaming. \u201cExcuse me, Maggie. I\u2019ve got a fun project to get back to.\u201d I turned around to see a sinister smile on Dr. Harrison\u2019s face and his eyes beginning to glow brightly as he walked past me at a brisk pace. I tried not to think about what he was going to do to Philip and just simply sat back down at my desk to begin my paperwork.\n\n\n\nAfter a few more minutes of paperwork, I looked up to see Rachel entering the clinic. And for the first time since the attack that had left her face permanently scarred, she wasn\u2019t wearing her face mask. She quickly walked over to Wilson and stood before him awkwardly.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cHi, Ms. Rachel!\u201d Wilson was ecstatic to see her. If he were a dog, no doubt his tail would be wagging so fast that it might just fly right off of him. She smiled back at him and couldn\u2019t help but giggle at how adorable he looked. And to my surprise and delight, she stood up on her tippy toes and gently kissed Wilson on the cheek.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to lunch today,\u201d she said with a bright smile before quickly turning to walk away from him. \u201cHi, Maggie!\u201d She waved to me before practically skipping her way over to Dr. Harrison\u2019s OR. I looked over at Wilson and couldn\u2019t help but giggle at his dumbfounded reaction at being kissed. He reached his hand to touch where she kissed him, and I thought the poor boy was going to melt into his blob form from how hard he was blushing.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBecause of Dr. Harrison\u2019s interest in Philip, today we weren\u2019t technically open. Even Rachel only helped him for a few hours before being shooed away from the OR to let Dr. Harrison do whatever he was doing to Philip. I was focused on paperwork, but I spared a glance every so often to watch Rachel and Wilson talk out of the corner of my eye. After getting kicked out, she had made herself comfy in the waiting room as she chatted with Wilson. They were so adorable together that it was hard for me to focus on the paperwork.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSuddenly, just as I was finishing up with my last few pages, the rotary phone began to ring. I froze in my tracks and quickly looked over at the phone. I looked back at Wilson and Rachel, and both of them had also stopped their conversation to stare at the phone. I carefully pushed myself out of my chair, wincing in pain as I did so, and walked over to the phone. I pulled the receiver from its holder and placed it against my ear.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cDr. Harrison\u2019s office. Maggie speaking.\u201d I answered. Despite the phone probably being over a hundred years old, I could hear the posh accent coming in clearly from the other end of the line. And it was the voice of Mr. Sinclair, Dr. Harrison\u2019s strange and terrifying patron.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cTell James that I\u2019m going to be visiting him tomorrow.\u201d Before I could even respond, the line had already clicked and gone dead. I stared at the receiver for a moment before placing it back on its mount. I looked over at Wilson and Rachel, but they had returned to talking and giggling with each other. I smiled at them before deciding that I should be the one to tell Dr. Harrison about his new appointment. I was his receptionist after all.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI approached the OR, and just from the sounds coming from behind the door, I was getting nauseous. I took a deep breath before knocking on the door and waiting. I waited for a few seconds before knocking again and waiting. \u201cDr. Harrison? It\u2019s Maggie! Mr. Sinclair call-\u201d Before I could even finish, the door swung open and Dr. Harrison was standing before me, almost completely drenched in blood.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat did he say?!\u201d he asked, his eyes wide and glowing so bright green that my head throbbed in pain the moment I looked at him. I quickly lifted my hands to block his gaze and to avoid staring at him, drenched so completely in blood.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s visiting you tomorrow! That\u2019s all he said!\u201d I looked away from him and finally lowered my hands when my head began to throb less. Dr. Harrison was staring at me with fear in his eyes before he ripped the surgical mask off and panted quickly. It looked like he was having a panic attack.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, no, no, no!\u201d He quickly looked behind him into the OR before looking back at me. Without another word, he quickly slammed the door in my face. I was just a little puzzled about that, but I supposed that it was about the same as when your parents are about to visit you and you haven\u2019t cleaned your house yet. So I returned to my reception desk and started again on my last few pieces of paperwork.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cHey, Maggie?\u201d Rachel asked as she approached my desk. I looked up at her to see that she had left Wilson standing at the door to the clinic. \u201cCan you cover for us? We\u2019re going to lunch.\u201d She said with a soft smile as she motioned her head over at Wilson. \u201cI\u2019m also going to take him clothes shopping, so we might be gone for a bit.\u201d To think that this was the same girl who, not that long ago, had called me fat and almost every name under the sun. But seeing her happy just made me smile.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cOf course, Rachel. Have fun with him. And make sure he doesn\u2019t melt.\u201d I half joked. But with Wilson, that was a real concern. She nodded quickly and waved goodbye as she walked over and held Wilson\u2019s hand as she led both of them out of the clinic. I smiled as I watched them leave before finishing my last piece of paperwork and filing it away. Just as I lay back in my chair to enjoy the satisfaction of finishing my work, a loud crash came from OR.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt soon became abundantly clear that I had been left alone with Dr. Harrison. And not to mention, by the look he gave me when I had mentioned that Mr. Sinclair would be visiting tomorrow, and the reminder of what happened to patients when Dr. Harrison lost control over them. I quickly shot up from my chair, wincing in pain but ignoring it as I ran to the OR. Just as I got to the door, it exploded into splinters as Dr. Harrison went flying past me into the wall across from it.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cJames! Are you okay?!\u201d I shouted as I ran over to him in the rubble of the door and the wall. He coughed uncontrollably before looking at me and quickly grabbed me by the arm and pulled himself up. Before I could even ask him what was happening, he squeezed my arm and yanked me down the hall as he started running.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cMAGGIE!\u201d An ear-splitting screech echoed out from the room as suddenly a mass of limbs and bones came tumbling out of the room Dr. Harrison had just been thrown from. It quickly unwound itself to reveal Philip\u2019s mangled and transformed body. Dr. Harrison had stripped his body of most of his skin and had attached various arms and legs to his torso. His lower jaw was gone and replaced with a row of teeth that went down the length of his throat. He screeched at us as he began to run after us, using all of his new limbs to close the distance between us, and just as Dr. Harrison pulled me into one of the rooms, the Philip creature whipped his tail toward us, which for a brief moment I saw was made of his spine.\u00a0\n\n\n\nJames quickly shoved a chair against the door and shoved himself against it. \u201cWhere\u2019s Wilson?!\u201d He screamed at me, grunting as the Philp monster slammed itself against the door and caused Dr. Harrison to skid his feet across the floor. He quickly slammed himself against the door again and tried his best to keep the creature from breaking in.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cH-he and Rachel went out for lunch! What the fuck did you do to him?! Out of all the things you could\u2019ve done, you turned him into a centipede?!\u201d It was the best approximation I could put to the monster now threatening to break down the door and do God knows what to both of us.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cI thought I could control him! But then I lost control after I learned Mr. Sinclair will visit tomorrow!\u201d He grunted as the creature again slammed itself against the door, the frame starting to crack because of the intense weight being thrown against it. \u201cShit, shit, shit!\u201d Dr. Harrison was clearly panicking, and I couldn\u2019t help but start to as well. \u201cCan you climb through the window there?\u201d He asked me quickly. I looked over at where he had his gaze trained.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cMaybe if I weren\u2019t chubby!\u201d I shouted at him, seeing that the window was much to small to get through. \u201cWhat about you? You\u2019re thin enough to go through there!\u201d I told him, quickly running over and adding my weight to the door.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not just going to leave you here!\u201d he shouted at me. I looked at him and frowned in anger.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cNows not the time to be a dumbass James, get your ass through that window and figure something out!\u201d I yelled at him, letting out a surprised yelp when the creature slammed itself against the door again and more cracks began to form on both the door and the frame. Dr. Harrison looked at me and then over at the window before finally running over to it and opening it.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do?!\u201d he asked as he opened the window and began to climb out of it. I looked at him and then around the room that we had entered. There were plenty of things here for me to use for defense, of course there wasn\u2019t a very high chance of success.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll figure something out, now go!\u201d I screamed at him, he looked at me with worry before fully leaving through the window. At most, it would take him a minute or two to circle back around the clinic and get through. So I had to survive for that long by myself. I quickly left the door and began searching through the cabinets for something to defend myself with. And then my eyes landed on a fire extinguisher mounted on the wall. Just as the creature finally broke down the door, I managed to pick up the fire extinguisher from its mount.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cMAGGIE!\u201d The Philp monster screamed as it finally crashed through the door. I quickly pulled the safety pin out of the extinguisher and quickly blasted the creature with it. A giant cloud of CO2 quickly filled the room and sent both of us into an intense coughing fit. The Philip centipede writhed around and flicked its tail around as the CO2 clung to its mangled body. I held down on the trigger as I quickly exited out into the hallway and held onto the extinguisher as I quickly ran out into the lobby, right into Dr. Harrison, who quickly wrapped me around in his hands and yanked me away and towards the exit.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWe had only just exited out into the parking lot when the Philip centipede crashed through a window of the clinic, still writhing around in pain but now having his eyes trained squarely on the two of us. I looked over at Dr. Harrison and watched as he tried to hypnotize the centipede with his eyes. But to both of our shock, the centipede remained completely unfazed and quickly began to charge at us. I acted quickly and blasted it again with the extinguisher, sending the creature sputtering again.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat do we do now?!\u201d I screamed at Dr. Harrison as I held down the trigger of the extinguisher. I stared down at the gauge and saw that we didn\u2019t have much time to be thinking of what to do next. Dr. Harrison looked at me and then quickly grabbed the extinguisher from me.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cTake the keys out of my pocket! My car is that Chevy Bel Air over there!\u201d He shouted. I quickly picked up what he was thinking and quickly went fishing through his pockets until I found the keys. I sprinted towards the convertible and quickly hopped in. I put the keys in the ignition and spared a glance over at Dr. Harrison. The extinguisher had just run out, and he was now using the empty container like a baseball bat to fend off the centipede creature.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI turned the car on, and to my annoyance, saw that it was a manual. Trying to remember back to the time my dad had shown me how to drive stick, I managed to put the car into gear and quickly drove towards the centipede. I honked the horn to warn Dr. Harrison that I was on the way, and he quickly jumped out of the way, just as the Philip monster whipped at his face with its spinal tail.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI slammed the car into the centipede, and for a brief moment, we locked eyes with each other. It screeched at me one last time before I drove us full force into the side of the clinic. The force of the impact set off the airbag, and I came too with a splitting headache. I pushed my face off the steering wheel and looked up to see that the centipede was still alive, but now it was pinned against the wall.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI opened the door to the car and fell out and onto the floor, suddenly very aware of how much pain I was in. I let out some hard coughs as I looked around for Dr. Harrison. I saw him lying face down in the parking lot, and I quickly crawled over to him. I got to him and managed to roll him over on his back. Unfortunately, it looked like the creature had managed to slash his face. The cut extended across his entire face from his chin across his eyes and into his hair. His fake face was peeling from the cut, and his true, damaged face was exposed just beneath it. He wasn\u2019t going to be happy when he woke up, but for now, it seemed he\u2019d been knocked out by hitting his head on the hard asphalt.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI looked back over to the car wreck, and felt my heart sink when I saw that the centipede wasn\u2019t there anymore. I looked around quickly in fear, trying to find it. I had taken my eyes off of it for a mere second, and it had somehow managed to unpin itself. I tried shaking Dr. Harrison awake, but he was completely out cold.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cMAGGIE!\u201d It suddenly screamed as it lunged out towards me from one of the bushes near the clinic. I managed to lock eyes with it and felt that this was the end of the line for me. I closed my eyes and hoped that whatever the Philip creature would do to me would be quick. But a few seconds passed, and nothing happened to me. I slowly opened my eyes and saw that the creature was being slammed against the ground over and over again by Wilson.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cMaggie! Are you okay?! What happened here?!\u201d Rachel quickly asked as she kneeled down next to me and quickly began to examine me. I looked at her and then over at Wilson as he slammed the centipede on the floor like it was nothing. And he was in nice new clothes that were quickly becoming blood-stained. I couldn\u2019t help but smile and look at Rachel with a smile.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cDid you two have a nice date?\u201d I asked her before I flopped over onto the parking lot ground. All of the adrenaline had finally left my body, and I passed out from the pain of the car crash I had just been through.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhen I next came to, I was in one of the recovery rooms. I had a mild concussion, but Rachel had assured me that nothing else was wrong with me. She had had to fix up my stitches as during the ordeal, they had snapped and come undone, but all in all, I had gotten off lightly. Dr. Harrison was still unconscious, so we were all waiting around to see when he\u2019d awaken. Wilson had taken care of the centipede. Rachel wouldn\u2019t exactly tell me how he\u2019d done it, but I had seen Wilson rub his stomach with a satisfied look on his face, so I could at least infer what he\u2019d done.\u00a0\n\n\n\nRachel had brought me a snack, so I was sitting in my reception area eating the muffin she had brought me. It was good, but the entire ordeal had taken my appetite from me. I didn\u2019t want to waste the muffin, however, so when I heard the familiar rummaging coming from the lost and found box, I quietly rolled over to it. The bread creature was looking through everything again, and it quickly took notice of me, all of its eyeballs looking up at me.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cYou want this?\u201d I held out the muffin to it. I didn\u2019t know if it would be considered cannibalism for a burnt piece of toast to eat a muffin, but after everything I\u2019d gone through, I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised in the least. I set the muffin down into the box, and as soon as I did, the bread creature grabbed it and quickly sprinted out of the box. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d I scoffed as it skedaddled away.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAs I was sitting in the reception area and Wilson and Rachel were busy being lovebugs together, I heard something crawling over to me. As I swivvled in my chair to see what it was, a hand reached out and grabbed my hand.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cMaggie\u2026\u201d It was Dr. Harrison. He was panting uncontrollably, and his face was still heavily damaged from the fight. He squeezed my hand and also placed his other hand on my thigh, giving it an even harder squeeze. \u201cYou\u2026you did this to me.\u201d He hissed gently, his voice hoarse and coarse like gravel. I stared at him for a moment, thinking that he had forgotten what had just happened in the parking lot.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t what he meant. As I stared into his green eyes, which were bloodshot and in obvious agony, it finally hit me. Why had he suddenly started stalking me again after our interaction? Because I had touched his face. It had seemed like nothing to me, but to him, it had been an invitation to try and earn my love and affection. He wasn\u2019t blaming me for his face, he was blaming me for his actions. For his obsession with me.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAs I stared down at him, I couldn\u2019t help but find him so pathetic. I was immune to his hypnosis, and this fascinated him to no end. And it had grown into an obsession. I sighed deeply and reached both my hands out and held his face in my hands. His pupils shrank into pinpricks when I touched him before they suddenly expanded to the size of dinner plates. He looked up at me like he was in pure ecstasy.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cOh\u2026Maggie.\u201d A happy smile spread across his face as he touched his hands against mine and looked at me with pure joy. I gave him what he wanted, and hopefully, going forward, I can keep him more stable. And if that means turning into his babysitter and making him believe that I have any sort of feelings for him?\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo be it.\u00a0\n\n"},"49":{"title":"The man with the upside-down head controls my life by flipping a coin.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1ki0jqs\/the_man_with_the_upsidedown_head_controls_my_life\/","flair":null,"author":"Educational_Tea_1582","selftext":"Just a year ago, I was at rock bottom.

In the evening, to forget.\n\nAnd then it happened.\n\nMy bedroom door creaked open with a long, eerie moan that made my heart plummet. I never left it open. I turned, and from the bedroom stepped something \u2014 slowly, rhythmically clicking its heels. A man, maybe thirty, dressed like a corpse from the 19th century: tailcoat, vest with tarnished copper buttons, black leather gloves, and golden wristwatch. But none of it mattered \u2014 because his head... his head was turned completely around. Along with his face.\n\nHis skin was taut and smooth, unnaturally stretched. His chin sat where his forehead should be. Bulging brown eyes stared from upside-down sockets like marbles, and his crooked smile revealed yellow teeth. Filthy hair clung to his neck. He tossed a silver coin in one hand, catching it with dirt-caked nails. I screamed, pressing myself against the wall. My entire body crawled with terror. I could barely breathe.\n\n\u201cYou called,\u201d he whispered.\n\nHis mouth barely moved. He kept tossing the damn coin every second.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d I choked, gasping in fear.\n\u201cA Player. We can play a game \u2014 one that will change your life. Generous rewards... and brutal losses.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know what I was thinking. Maybe I believed it was a drunken hallucination, maybe I\u2019d lost my mind \u2014 but I agreed. And oh, how wrong I was. It was real. But back then, I had nothing left to lose. That\u2019s when he laid out the rules.\n\n\u201cHeads, and you stay alive \u2014 with a chance to win in future games and earn rewards. Tails... and I take your life. Right here, right now.\u201d\n\nMy lips moved before my mind caught up. I agreed. He flipped the coin \u2014 and time slowed. I saw it twirl, silver like the moon.\nHeads.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll meet again, winner.\u201d\nHe smiled faintly and disappeared into my bedroom. When I rushed to check, the room was empty. My knees buckled with fear and confusion. But it was only the beginning.\n\nThe first few days were normal. I drank and smoked from morning till night. By the third day, I had no money left. The fourth morning, I stood at a crosswalk, eyes bloodshot, staring at the red light. That\u2019s when I heard it \u2014 like a knife to the back.\n\n\u201cHeads \u2014 and you\u2019ll cross safely. Tails \u2014 you\u2019ll die under a car.\u201d\n\nMy heart froze. I turned. There he was \u2014 smiling, flipping the coin between his fingers. I begged him not to, but his smile widened, revealing yellowed fangs. He flipped the coin.\n\nHeads.\n\nI crossed. In the grass on the other side, I found an envelope. Inside: twenty thousand dollars. I burst into tears, then laughter. I couldn\u2019t describe the madness surging through me \u2014 hysteria, holding that envelope in shaking hands.\n\nI paid off my debts. Cleaned my apartment for the first time in months. Nearly stopped drinking. How I wished it had ended there. But now I know \u2014 that first coin toss wasn\u2019t a game. It was a contract.\n\nA week later, I was brushing my teeth when I heard a snap behind me.\n\n\u201cHeads \u2014 your tooth cracks. Tails \u2014 no cavities to worry about.\u201d\n\nCoin flips.\nHeads.\n\nI saw it split in the mirror \u2014 the pain was blinding. I crawled, bleeding, to the dentist. And after that, he came more often. Wherever I went \u2014 elevator, car, street \u2014 he was there. Tossing the coin. Each toss shaped my day.\n\nI slipped in public and broke my nose. Found wallets full of cash. Met stunning women who seemed programmed to fall into my bed. A streak of tiny wins. A parade of tiny losses. One morning, I didn\u2019t wake up naturally \u2014 I awoke to him standing over me.\n\n\u201cHeads \u2014 the stock market bows before you. Tails \u2014 you lose everything.\u201d\n\nHeads.\nI made a fortune. Bought my dream home, car \u2014 lived carefree. He appeared only to toss the coin. I kept winning. Maybe luck was with me... or maybe he wanted me to win.\n\nOne coin toss later, I had a girlfriend. Then a wife. Her laughter was like bells. Her eyes \u2014 oceanic.\n\n\u201cHeads \u2014 she\u2019ll give you beautiful children. Tails \u2014 she dies in her sleep.\u201d\n\nHe said it one night, standing by our bed.\n\nI couldn\u2019t speak. Tails.\n\nShe never woke up.\n\nThe stakes grew. He became constant. When he wasn\u2019t physically there, he appeared in puddles, windows, mirrors \u2014 smiling, flipping his coin. I\u2019d turn \u2014 nothing. My house emptied. I should have grieved, but I had just won another game \u2014 and lost my love for her.\n\nOtherwise, I\u2019d have spiraled into depression again.\n\nMoney flowed in and out. Then I lost \u2014 and got lung cancer. I heard him chuckle as I coughed blood. Another toss: both legs shattered with a grotesque snap. One win healed me \u2014 the cancer vanished. Another loss would\u2019ve given me dementia.\n\nEven winning stopped bringing joy. All I felt was fear \u2014 fear of him coming back to toss the monstrous coin again. Losses began outweighing wins. I stopped shaving \u2014 what if a toss said I\u2019d slit my throat? I stopped bathing, stopped doing anything. He didn\u2019t care. He came anyway.\n\nHe stepped from my closet, silver coin blackened and stained.\n\n\u201cHeads \u2014 you go blind in one eye. Tails \u2014 in both.\u201d\n\nI screamed, begged him to stop, said I\u2019d give up everything. He listened... then flipped.\n\nHeads. I went blind in my left eye. \n\nBefore my eye surgery, lying on the table, I saw him on a chair beside me. He whispered:\n\n\u201cHeads \u2014 a surgical error takes your hearing. Tails \u2014 you die on the operating table.\u201d\n\nTerror froze me. I wept. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d I whispered.\n\nHe flipped. Heads.\n\nI\u2019m half-blind. Completely deaf. My heart pounds. Sweat pours constantly. I can\u2019t sleep \u2014 when I do, he\u2019s there. When I\u2019m awake, he\u2019s still there.\n\nHe no longer appears in reflections \u2014 he just sits beside me, silently mirroring my every move. A man with a backward head, draining my life with each second. No words can describe the horror of being near him. I tried to shoot myself \u2014 heads, the gun didn\u2019t fire. Tried to hang myself \u2014 heads, the rope snapped just in time.\n\nThen he vanished for a whole day.\n\nOnly to reappear at dawn, sitting on my windowsill, head tilted grotesquely upward, driving a finger into his chest. With his blood, he wrote on my wall:\n\n\u201cTomorrow, 7:00 AM \u2014 final game. Heads \u2014 you die quickly, painlessly. Tails \u2014 you\u2019ll scream as loud as you can... until you die.\u201d\n\nI begged. Sobbed. Screamed without hearing myself. With my one working eye, I saw him grinning, enjoying it, as he vanished again.\n\nI\u2019m typing this now, watching the clock. It\u2019s 6:53 AM."},"50":{"title":"I fell asleep with the TV on, I woke up to a live stream from inside my house.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1khx818\/i_fell_asleep_with_the_tv_on_i_woke_up_to_a_live\/","flair":null,"author":"Jdub81191","selftext":"  \nI\u2019m scared. I don\u2019t understand what happened. I haven\u2019t been home since.\n\n  \nI live alone, I\u2019m a hard working, fairly young guy. I just bought my own house last year and while yes sometimes I get spooked when I hear a creak in the house, I have never had an experience like I faced last week.\u00a0\n\n  \nAs you can imagine in this economy it\u2019s not the easiest to own property by yourself. Most people wait until they are married and have dual incomes to purchase a home. I on the other hand believed I could handle the responsibility on my own. It wasn\u2019t easy don\u2019t get me wrong. Sometimes the bills were paid and I had very little spending money for anything else. I was okay with that though. I guess you can call it pride. I felt proud owning my own house. Late 20\u2019s, good job, and now my own house. I was doing well enough for myself.\u00a0\n\n  \nLike I said, I am a hard worker. Sometimes not by choice but by necessity. Mortgage and bills needed to be paid and I didn\u2019t have anyone else to rely on. That meant any over time I could get my hands on I took. Need me to come in early? No problem. Need me to work a double? Say no more. I believed if I could earn enough money to get ahead of my bills then I could slow down the over time and really start to enjoy the fruits of my labor.\u00a0\n\n  \nAfter a long week of work I was ready to fall asleep just about anywhere. Exhausted was not the word. The drive home was rough but I made I finally made it home. I walked in the door, threw my bag on the floor and headed for the kitchen. I just wanted to get something in my stomach before knocking out for the night. I grabbed a beer out of the fridge and a frozen pizza out of the freezer. I put the pizza in the air fryer and spotted what I would describe to be \u201cthe most comfortable spot known to man\u201d my worn down couch. It wasn\u2019t pretty but it felt like I was sitting on a cloud. I grabbed the remote and began flipping through the channels. I didn\u2019t have anything in mind just something for background noise as I ate. I barely made it past 5 channels before I was sleeping on the couch. I would have slept there all night if it wasn\u2019t for the smell of my pizza burning in the air fryer letting me know my pizza was past the point of consumption. I woke up in a daze, my eyes fighting to stay open. I forced myself to sit up. Right before I got up I noticed something strange on the TV.\u00a0\n\n  \nI thought I was dreaming. I sat up straight, rubbed my eyes a few times but it still didn\u2019t make any sense. I was looking at my living room. It was a bit fuzzy, sort of had a \u201chome movie\u201d type of filter on it. I couldn\u2019t process what was happening. There was a timestamp in the bottom right that read 02:07 AM. I glanced at the cable box and noticed it was now 02:45 AM. My attention was brought back to the TV when the video started playing. You could see my front door just barely in frame, I saw myself entering my house. Throwing my bag down. Heading to the kitchen. Walking out with a beer and sitting down on the couch. I saw myself drift off to sleep within seconds of sitting on the couch and then the video stopped. Then it began to rewind. I saw the front door close and the video paused again. Then the screen went black.\u00a0\n\n  \n\u201cWhat the fuck is going on.\u201d I said under my breath.\n\n  \nI had to be dreaming. This had to be some sort of weird sleep deprivation thing I was experiencing. Was I hallucinating? Was someone playing a sick prank on me? It was the only thing that made sense.\n\n  \nI didn\u2019t understand what was happening. I panicked, after frantically searching for the remote I grabbed it and attempted to turn the tv back on. I was met with static. I was about to stand up and get the fuck out of my house but just as I was standing up, I felt it. The feeling you get when someone is watching you. When someone walks into a room and is staring a hole right into you. I froze in place as the TV displayed a new image. I recognized what I was seeing immediately. The view from staircase in my house leading down into the living room.\u00a0\n\n  \nMy phone buzzed next to me. I quickly grabbed it. I received a notification for a new voicemail. My phone never rang. This had to be it, the big reveal. One of my buddies playing some oddly elaborate trick on me. That\u2019s what I wanted to believe. I held the phone to my ear and listened to the message.\u00a0\n\n  \n\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d\n\n  \nA strange voice, a voice I didn\u2019t recognize. I began spinning the Rolodex in my mind, trying to match the voice to someone I know.\u00a0\n\n  \nThat\u2019s when I heard it.\n\n  \nA creak at the top of the steps, the video was live.\u00a0\n\n  \nI didn\u2019t dare look up at the stairs. I didn\u2019t move a muscle. I just sat there, my heart pounding against my ribs like it wanted to escape. The TV screen remained fixed on the staircase. It was dark, grainy, but I could still make out the faint silhouette of someone\u2014or something\u2014standing motionless at the top step. It wasn\u2019t moving. Neither was I.\n\n  \nI held my breath.\n\n  \nAnother creak.\n\n  \nIt stepped down one stair.\n\n  \nThen another.\n\n  \nStill, the figure didn\u2019t move on the screen.\n\n  \nI finally turned my head\u2014just slightly\u2014toward the staircase.\n\n  \nEmpty.\n\n  \nBut the sound of footsteps continued.\n\n  \nSlow. Deliberate. Not rushing. Like it\u00a0*wanted*\u00a0me to hear every single step. My hand hovered over my phone. I tried to dial 911, but the screen stayed black. Dead. Even though I remembered charging it earlier that night.\n\n  \nThe TV glitched again.\n\n  \nNew angle.\n\n  \nNow it was from behind me. From the kitchen, facing the back of my head. I could see myself, motionless, staring at the screen. Behind me, in the shadows of the hallway, something moved. A tall, thin figure slowly entering the frame. I turned to look behind me.\n\n  \nNothing.\n\n  \nI looked back at the TV. The figure was closer now, standing right behind the couch, right behind me.\n\n  \nI shot up and bolted for the front door. I didn\u2019t look back. I couldn\u2019t. I just ran. I didn\u2019t care that I was barefoot. I didn\u2019t care that my car keys were still on the kitchen counter. I sprinted down the street, past the other darkened houses, until I made it to the gas station at the corner.\n\n  \nI called the police from there.\n\n  \nThey didn\u2019t find anything when they searched the house. No signs of forced entry. No fingerprints. No evidence of tampering with the TV. They told me maybe it was a bad dream, maybe I\u2019d fallen asleep watching something and my mind had filled in the blanks.\n\n\n\nI wanted to believe them. But I knew better.\n\n\n\nBecause the next day, when I went back to gather a few things and figure out what to do next, there was a note slipped under my door.\n\n\n\nFrom the inside.\n\n\n\nNo envelope. Just a piece of paper.\n\n\n\nIt said:\n\n\u201cI told you not to move.\u201d"},"51":{"title":"I found an old numbers station. Then the tapes started showing up.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1khpbcf\/i_found_an_old_numbers_station_then_the_tapes\/","flair":null,"author":"rabbitX14420","selftext":"Ok guys, I'm officially scared and don't know what else to do or who to turn to. Long story short, let me just ask if everyone here is familiar with \"numbers stations\"?\n\nWell for those that don't, briefly, they\u2019re weird shortwave radio broadcasts--just roboticish voices reading strings of numbers and sometimes letters. No explanation. No station ID. Just:\n\n\u201cFour. Seven. Two. One.\u201d Repeat.\n\nThey\u2019ve existed since the Cold War and some say they\u2019re spy transmissions. Others think it\u2019s something worse. Thing is, some are still broadcasting, and a few didn\u2019t seem to have a source. \n\nOr so I thought.\n\nNow my background, I used to work overnights at a tiny FM radio station in Pennsylvania\u2014WQRC 98.7. Graveyard shift. We were a Class A station, running mostly automated playlists, but I\u2019d be there to log weather carts, cue PSAs, and hit the liners every hour.\n\nMost nights, it was just me, the board, and a crusty old pot of gas station coffee.\n\nOne night, bored out of my mind, I started playing around with our Kenwood R-5000 receiver. It's an old shortwave radio with manual tuning, and sometimes I\u2019d just scroll through the bands to see what odd stuff was floating through the ether.\n\nThat\u2019s when I found it\u201414225 kHz.\n\nNo call sign. No station ID. Just this flat, robotic little girl\u2019s voice reading numbers:\n\n\u201cNine. Four. Zero. One. Seven. Zero.\u201d\n\nThen a pause.\n\nThen this awful clicking sound\u2014wet and erratic. Like keys on glass or something. Then silence.\n\nI thought I just stumbled upon another old numbers station, but this one felt (the only way I know how to describe it)... wrong. A literal, emotional, spiritual feeling? Hell I don't know, but I didn\u2019t *feel* like it was broadcasting. I felt like it was listening.\n\nI recorded it straight into Adobe Audition from the monitor output on the board and played it back three times through the studio monitors. Every single time, something weird happened.\n\nThe Orban processor flickered. The silence monitor tripped. The lights buzzed. I swear I heard breathing behind me.\n\nI told Mitch, our weekend weather guy and part-time engineer. He laughed, until I played it for him.\n\nThen he went pale.\n\n\u201cI used to hear that broadcast as a kid,\u201d he said. \u201cNot on a radio though. Through my bedroom wall.\u201d\n\nThe following Monday, we got a package in the station dropbox. No return address. Just six numbers on a scrap of paper:\n\n940170\n\nInside: a VHS tape.\n\nIt showed grainy, black-and-white footage of the station. Filmed from across the road. The camera zoomed in on the studio window. On me, sitting at the board.\n\nThe timestamp? Three days from now.\n\nAt exactly 2:37 a.m., the power goes out in the footage. I stand up suddenly\u2014like something yanks me upward off my seat. Then: static.\n\nWe thought it was a prank.\n\nUntil that Friday. At exactly 2:37 a.m., the power actually cut out. The UPS kicked in. The transmitter stayed live, but the console died for twelve seconds.\n\nAnd something cold grabbed my neck.\n\nI checked the next morning. Bruises. Five, scrawny, finger-shaped marks. Like something had grabbed me with wires made of ice.\n\nEvery Monday, another package, another tape.\nEach one showed something that hadn\u2019t happened yet, and each one came true.\n\nJanelle, our traffic anchor, vanished during a live break. Just like the tape. Her car was found at a rest stop, still idling. No trace of her in the system. No lease. No pay stubs. Even our ENCO playout logs were wiped clean\u2014like she\u2019d never recorded a single cart.\n\nWith some much needed advice and help from a few others, I attempted to see if there were patterns to the numbers. I couldn't believe it! We found that some were coordinates, others pointed to military facilities and old decommissioned towers. One pointed directly to our STL dish. But another? My own home address.\n\nAfter this, the broadcast on 14225 changed.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the little girl\u2019s voice anymore.\n\nIt was Mitch\u2019s, then Janelle's.\n\nThen it was mine.\n\n\u201cYou are now a relay station. Repeat. You are now... a relay station.\u201d\n\nDesperately seeking answers, I found an old Usenet thread from 1998, buried in a conspiracy archive. Someone posted about something called The Glass Frequency and said it was a signal that didn\u2019t just transmit information\u2014it transmitted you. \n\nThe final line in the thread said:\n\n\u201cIf you hear yourself, you are no longer you.\"\n\nWQRC signed off in 2021. Official cause: a lightning strike took out our STL path. The FCC listed it as a silent station.\n\nSince then, I've been tuning into 14225 online and as I said above, I'm scared and need help. \n\nWhy? \n\nLast night  I tuned into 14225 and now I know I don\u2019t have much time. Listening to yourself tell you: \"Zero. Zero. One. You are next\u201d psychologically destroys you. Please. If anyone has any helpful information,  or have heard of anything else like this, you know what to do.\n\n\nUPDATE: I think I\u2019m going to try to find Mitch.\n\nSo first off, thanks to everyone who's dm'd and commented and shared! Some of you have reached out (again, thank you), and I\u2019ve been going through them all. \n\nOne stood out though. \n\nMitch.\n\nWhere he is now, if I\u2019ve spoken to him recently. Well the truth is, I haven\u2019t.\n\nHe stopped showing up a few weeks before WQRC went dark in 2021. No warning, no goodbye. Management said he \"moved to Ohio.\" I tried emailing him last night as soon as I saw the comment but it bounced back. Also, I called the number I had saved but it no longer worked.\n\nBut something has been eating at me:\n\nMitch said, \u201cI used to hear that broadcast as a kid,\" \u201cNot on a radio though. Through my bedroom wall.\u201d\n\nThat never made sense to me. Until now.\n\nI pulled some of our old transmitter logs and FCC filings and I found an address for a decommissioned relay site WQRC used before moving its STL path to the current tower. It\u2019s in the woods outside a town about two hours from me thats been buried in a floodplain that\u2019s been off the grid since 2009.\n\nThat reminded me, Mitch used to call it \"the dead feed.\" He joked that the place still hummed, even with the breakers off.\n\nI\u2019m heading there tomorrow night.\n\nIf I find anything\u2014if I find Mitch\u2014I\u2019ll update you all. If I don\u2019t... well, the signal probably will.\n\nAnd if any of you are tuning into 14225 kHz at 2:37 a.m., please let me know what you hear.\n\nEspecially if it\u2019s me.\n\nWish me luck. Hopefully I can update soon.

What that means in woman-speak, God knows. All I know is that I don\u2019t know.\n\nBut she did seem a lot more up-beat than usual\u2026\n\nShe *did* have the will and energy to cook something extra for me and dad.

He said he doesn\u2019t know much and doesn\u2019t give a shit.

He tried it, he said it is pretty damn good.\n\nThen I mentioned that I got out of the kiosk for a few minutes and I almost got a face full of glass and off-brand transdimensional vodka.\n\nHe told me that I had \u201cone fucking job\u201d and that I am an idiot.\n\nI mean I got multiple jobs here? I serve customers and don\u2019t go out of the kiosk?\n\nThat\u2019s *two* jobs, if I am counting right.\n\nAnyway, he told me not to do it again, lest the kiosk *\u201cdoes the thing\u201d* again.\n\nWhat the *\u201cthing\u201d* is, who knows?\n\nThe kiosk is prone to doing a lot of things. Such as spawning random portals and attracting very interesting customers. Not to mention the little people.\n\nThose tiny fucks seemed to have gotten bigger in numbers ever since the hallway manifested\u2026 Thankfully, they are colonizing the hallway, not the kiosk. But they still come around just to fuck with me.\n\n\\###\u00a0\n\n4^(th) May, 21:02\n\nWinston also told me that to not let *anyone* into the kiosk. That includes my baby sister. Well, I can kind of guess why\u2026 Actually it is quite obvious. It smells of alcohol and mildew and knowing my sister, she\u2019d probably gag from the stench.\n\nI am surprised that she didn\u2019t throw up from the smell of vomit and shit outside, but she\u2019s got a strong stomach I guess. Still, she does not like alcohol.\n\nOf course there\u2019s the hallway too, that would probably weird her out. But I doubt she\u2019d call the fucking government or something. Maybe the government is already involved in this\u2026\n\nI\u2019d be surprised that they would simply lose the paperwork, knowing my country\u2019s effective bureaucracy.\n\nAh, a customer. I\u2019ll be back.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\\###\n\n\n\n4^(th) May, 22:20\n\nA few customers, an old face too\u2026 Well, that is not a good way of putting it. He \u2013 or *she* doesn\u2019t really have a face. Just smooth skin. How does it breathe? I asked myself all of question before, but I am simply starting to give up now. \u00a0\n\nIt doesn\u2019t speak as well, so\u2026 I just kinda know what it wants, like the moment I see that flat and featureless slab of skin I automatically know the brand of brandy it wants\u2026 And it wanted the off-brand vodka actually, this time. The one from the hallway.\n\nIt was like it knew\u2026 No eyes, no ears, no nose, no tongue. Yet I felt like it could see into me and through me.\n\nI call it \u201cFaceless\u201d \u2013 though *yes* it does look like the Slenderman, a bit. But not freakishly tall or anything, slightly taller than me maybe \u2013 and I am average. And of course the top hat, it finishes the look of some kind eldritch gentleman.\n\nWell, it pays well, even tips me. Which is a rarity. So yeah, I don\u2019t mind. Very formally dressed, smells of lavender and I can only smell a whiff of stale milk.\n\nThat could very well be from the environment. Nice top hat too, very clean, very clean.\n\nThe rest were the usual, local drunks, one bloodsucker I know of. Mister number two, and his usual scowling face and baggy eyes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\\###\n\n\n\n4^(th) May, 23:12\n\nWell, I had nothing to do, so I started messing around with the radio again.\n\nI think the little fucks decided to tamper with the shelves again, I swear some of the brandy and vodka has been moved\u2026 Candy bars also missing.\n\nAnyway, I sat at the entrance of the hallway, tried to pick some new frequency. To see if that \u201cAll About Vodka FM\u201d or \u201cSmirnoff\u2019s Delight FM\u201d is actually a thing.\n\n After a bit of tampering \u2013 something like 15 minutes. I realized I have to inside.\n\nReluctantly I did, I went inside a bit deeper than I usually do. But I took care that had my eyes on the entrance at all times. I didn\u2019t want some kind Inception or House of Leaves type fuckery turning this into the \u201cChronicles from the Kiosk Backrooms\u201d or some shit.\n\nI managed to get some kind of frequency, nothing major, mostly garbled noise. But I did hear some voices, I was able to make out some words. It sounded like a commercial. Surprisingly in English\u2026 Bear in mind \u2013 the radio station that it is stuck to is in my native language.\n\nSo maybe this shit is somewhere in America or England\u2026 Who knows. Maybe in a place where the sun never set on the British Empire and we all speak English, or something. Who knows!\n\nAt least it wasn\u2019t any creepy shit like telling me my name or something.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\\###\u00a0\n\n\n\n5^(th) May, 0:17\n\nAs per usual the roosters kept banging and my radio kept singing\u2026 I have to take back my last sentence. The radio did start saying a name I know\u2026 Just not mine, which is even more worrying. *Natalia* \u2013 my sister.\n\nI think I should do something about that\u2026\n\nOh, and yeah. Right when it was midnight, Miss Six showed up. With her usual rhythmic banging on the window. And that tiny glint of one of her green eyes through the old news papers.\n\nAt least I know that I am not in a surprise\u2026 But I felt a lot more awkward than usual.\n\nBecause I reaaally didn\u2019t want to skip the social contact this time. I had to get more info.\n\nSo I got up and opened the window up.\n\n\u201cEvening \u2013 Kristi, is it?\u201d I said. Trying to be more\u2026 *social.*\n\n\"Well Gory darlin\u2019 \u2013 you\u2019re right. Kristiana!\u201d\n\n*Why is she using the nickname my mother gave me.*\n\nShe wanted the usual with an additional pack of cigarettes \u2013 I call that *the number six with extra dip*.\n\nI gathered the balls to ask her a question.\n\n\u201cHow did you meet my sister?\u201d I asked, straight forward. To the point.\n\n\u201cHun I sure hope you\u2019re as forward with invitations as you\u2019re with questions. Well\u2026\u201d She began. \u2013 \u201cI met your sister at the university. She had struggled with her English, so I told her that I can tutor her. I am almost at native level myself!\u201d \u2013 A decent explanation. But I had other questions\u2026\n\n\u201cAh, I see\u2026 Can I ask you something *personal*, if you don\u2019t mind?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cOh, how private are talking? Diet private or bedroom private?\u201d \u2013 She responded in her usual flirty tone.\n\n\u201cDid you hear the banging on the top of the kiosk when you arrived with my sister\u2026\u201d \u2013 I *am curious about the diet of sixes she is surviving off of.*\n\nShe squinted her eyes at me \u2013 \u201cBanging? No, I didn\u2019t. And I came right after your sis, she forgot some things at my place. But I knew she\u2019d come here first. She did tell me she\u2019ll give you a surprise visit once. Also\u2026\u201d \u2013 She paused \u2013 *I think she is avoiding the question. Noted.*\n\n\u201cDid you like what I gave you?\u201d She asked\u2026\n\n\u201cWhat you-\u201c I remembered the plastic bag\u2026 Which I haven\u2019t touched in days.\n\n\u201cOh, yeah\u2026\u201d \u2013 I was weighing my options, honesty? Or lies? What was in that bag? A gift? A warning? Someone\u2019s head? Blackmail? Did she print out my search history?\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t open it.\u201d \u2013 She answered for me.\n\nI nodded \u2013 \u201cYeah\u2026 Sorry, been a bit busy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand. Don\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t spoil or anything. But I think you\u2019ll appreciate it.\u201d She said in a more neutral tone\u2026 She seemed genuine.\n\n\u201cIs it the\u2026 Bottle\u201d I asked.\n\nShe leaned in when I said that. That took me a bit by surprise, the scent of lavender perfume whiffed into my nose as she did that.\n\n\u201cWe all have our secrets Goran, and I\u2019d like to keep mine like that \u2013 a secret. Maybe I\u2019ll tell you some day. Maybe not. But hun, I have to go. Take care.\u201d She turned around, but stopped a few steps away.\n\n\u201cTake care of Natalia too, she\u2019s a good and smart girl. You are blessed to have such a sibling, believe me. I am sorry that I brought her to my place, I simply wanted to talk to her some more in private. It was a risk. Alas, she\u2019ll be safe \u2013 with a brother like you.\u201d\n\nShe turned back around and walked off.\n\nThat last part sounded like she added it\u2026 Sounds weird, but it was like a *aha that too* kind of moment.\n\nI just hope Natalia didn\u2019t spill too much beans about me\u2026\n\nFuck I forgot to ask her about the boyfriend part. Shit. I guess it\u2019s nothing, she didn\u2019t seem all too\u2026 I dunno.\n\nI am curious about that bag though\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\n\\###\n\n\n\n5^(th) May, 1:22\n\nI think there is something in the toilet.\n\nI am not sure what, but I swear to God that I heard some shuffling inside. And I know the walls are thinner right where the toilet is supposed to be.\n\nIt could be a fucking rooster. Which is not good news. Thankfully, the door is made out of metal and it hasn\u2019t been banged into yet. So that is a good sign.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s those little fucks again, somehow colonizing the damn shitter now. I don\u2019t care honestly I ain\u2019t going into that hell. They can have all of it for all I care \u2013 not even God himself could cleanse that place.\n\nWinston told me *nothing* except for us employees and himself can go inside the kiosk. That is a strict rule. I don\u2019t know if something that *forces* itself inside counts, but I\u2019ll see.\n\nFor context, the door to the toilet is right next to the hallway.\n\nAnd yes, I turned one nook into an improvised toilet inside there.\n\nYes, I held in my shit and used bottles to piss up until recently. The hallway was truly a blessing\u2026 I just hope Winston doesn\u2019t find my compost collection.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\\###\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n5^(th) May, 3:33\n\nSpeak of the devil, I went to take a piss and my shit was gone. Literally.\n\nDid those little fucks get a taste for\u2026 God I don\u2019t wanna imagine that. Well they did probably originate from the dump, but still. Vodka and shit? Fucking hell.\n\nOr it could be the hallway fuckery for all I know. I guess that I should be careful not to drop anything in their. Thankfully the smell is gone too, I was afraid that Winston would catch on. But it was replaced by\u2026 Stale milk.\n\n am really getting sick of that smell.\n\nAaand I just heard a bang.\n\nThe toilet door.\n\nGreat, amazing. Fucking magnificent.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\\###  \n\n\n5^(th) May, 7:27\n\nNo shift can end peacefully in the last week I see.\n\nWhen I stopped the last entry I went to check the toilet door, and I was promptly startled enough to drop on my ass by the goddamn hulk punch that left a *worryingly* large dent in the door.\n\nFor the second time this week, my heart started pounding out of its chest. I didn\u2019t feel safe, not at all.\n\nI thought \u201cWell, I am royally screwed\u201d.\n\nGo out? Get fucked by roosters, and God knows what else \u2013 the kiosk becomes a new black hole that sucks in what is left of this country. Or remain inside, and get murdered by a rooster.\n\nI don\u2019t even know how the things *looks* like, let alone what it can do\u2026 But I can get an idea from the fucking dent on the door.\n\nThen I realized, well\u2026 The hallway. Nothing else remained. The hallway.\n\nSo, when the other dent was made and when I saw the door start to break off the hinges. I grabbed a flashlight and ran for it.\n\nI heard the sound of the door being launched in the distance. I didn\u2019t dare look back. I just turned into an \u201calley\u201d of sorts, filled with you know what. Vodka, candybars, brandy, cigarettes\u2026 I could survive in here from the looks of it if I must\u2026 I\u2019d be an alcoholic, fat and probably have lung cancer.\n\nBut that is certainly better than being ripped apart by whatever that thing is.\n\nIt had been a minute. And I didn\u2019t hear anything. Just my chest beating and my breaths. I was, I\u2019d say\u2026 100 meters in? Maybe less. Still close enough to hear something. I think.\n\nBut nothing.\n\nI felt dizzy, disoriented.\n\nI got up and started walking.\n\nI then realized that the main hallway, the main highway if you will \u2013 is gone.\n\nI didn\u2019t feel scared. Moreso confused.\n\nHave you ever felt like time flew by? Or like it stood still?\n\nI felt both. Which was strange.\n\nI felt like I just entered inside. And at the same time like it had been forever ago.\n\nI just walked. I heard nothing but my footsteps.\n\nI smelled mildew and vodka and tobacco and that distinct smell of plastic wrapping.\n\nI felt nothing. Like all the will I had was consumed by something.\n\nThen \u2013 I smelled lavender. Like a perfume. It was familiar.\n\nSo I followed it.\n\nAnd after some time, it just appeared. The door. The entrance.\n\nAnd the moment I stepped through it was like I got out of water. Sound returned, I heard the radio. I heard a loud bang from the door, like someone closed it all of a sudden.\n\nAnd I smelled a hint of lavender. Stronger than ever inside\u2026\n\nThe door of the toilet was on the opposite side of where it should be.\n\nThe shelves were a mess. All the vodka and alcohol was gone \u2013 with some of it being spilled onto the floor, with glass.\n\nBut I was alive. At least that.\n\nThen I noticed something \u2013 on the ground.\n\nA piece of sticky paper, a small note.\n\nIt had messy handwriting, but I could make it.\n\n*\u201cGive her\u201d*\n\nI feel like I definitely should do something.\n\nI might quit.\u00a0\u00a0"},"53":{"title":"The Door in the Hollow","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1khwdc4\/the_door_in_the_hollow\/","flair":null,"author":"Zorro1996","selftext":"My name is Elijah. Never liked that name. I prefer Eli - shorter, less biblical, less... heavy. \n\nMy mother gave it to me. She was the kind of woman who left crosses above every doorframe and whispered prayers like they were passwords to another world. \"Elijah,\" she used to say, \"was a man of fire. A prophet. A messenger of God.\" \n\nShe said it like it meant something. Like I was supposed to live up to it. But to me, it always sounded like a curse. Too big for me. Too loud. Too certain. A name that came with expectations I never agreed to. Like being handed a coat you never asked to wear, stitched from someone else's beliefs. \n\nI'm not a religious man. At least, I wasn't.\n\nBut that changed. or started to change. Because of what happened a few years ago. And because it happened again - last night. \n\nI love to camp. I like the quiet, the solitude. The way the trees lean in, like they're listening. The way firelight makes everything dance. And of course the stories. Yeah, I know a story or two. Isn't that what campers are? Storytellers?\n\nThat's what I thought. Until I realized not all stories want to be told. Some wait in the silence. Some breathe in the dark. And some - some are listening back. \n\nHer name was Mara. We were supposed to go camping together- Black Hollow. She picked the spot, circled it on the map with a red pen. \"It's got a view of the whole valley,\" she said \"Feels like you're standing on the edge of the world.\" \n\nWe never made it.\n\nShe died two weeks before the trip. A Car accident. Wrong place, wrong time. That's what they told me, like it made any difference. I didn't camp for a long time after that. Couldn't.\n\nThe thought of it made my chest feel tight - like my lungs were wrapped in barbed wire. But time moves in strange ways. It dulls some things. Honestly, I just felt numb. I know it sharpens others. You start telling yourself you're okay, even if you're not. You start believing it, too. \n\nThree years later, I packed my gear. Same backpack, same boots, same sleeping bag we were supposed to share. I told myself it was part of the healing process. One final step.\n\nI was going to camp at Black Hollow. For her. For us.\n\nThe trail was over grown, almost like it hadn't been walked since. The map she circled was still folded in my glove box - her handwriting fading, but still there. I followed it.\n\nWhen I reached the clearing, It didn't feel like I remembered. It was quiet, yes. But not the kind of quiet that soothes you. the kind that waits. \n\nI set up camp. Made a fire. Watched the stars come out, one by one, like old friends trying to remember my name. \n\nAnd then I saw it. \n\nA door. Standing in the middle of the trees. no walls. No frame. Just a door - old, wooden, half-rotted, leaning slightly to one side. Like it had been waiting there for years. \n\nAt first, I thought it was some kind of memorial. Maybe someone else had lost someone here and left it behind, like a marker. I dont know. \n\nBut it didn't feel like a tribute. It felt... wrong.\n\nLike something forgotten by the world but not by the woods. I didn't touch it not that night.\n\nI didn't sleep, either.\n\nThe fire was dying and I watched it go without trying to stop it. Coals like little red eyes blinking shut one by one. The cold crept in slow. I sat with my arms tucked in and my grief curled beside me like it always does. It doesn't say much, just stays close. I heard the trees breathing. The low creak of the earth turning. A bird crying somewhere in the dark like it knew something I didn't. And then I heard her voice.\n\nMara. Not the way you hear someone in a dream. This was different Clear. Close. \"*Eli\"*, she said. Soft as anything. Like she was standing right behind me. Like she'd never died at all. \n\nI stood. I don't remember doing it, just that I was on my feet and moving through the trees toward that crooked old door. It hadn't changed. Still leaning. still there like it'd always been there, like the woods had grown up around it.\n\nI should've run. I should've prayed. But I didn't. Her voice came again. *\"Please\".* \n\nJust that. A single word and I swear it held every bit of her. The doorknob turned. Slow. Just a twitch. Enough to see the black line split down the center like a crack in the world. Not night. Not shadow. Something deeper. Older. Something without name. And I stood there, watching it open. \n\n"},"54":{"title":"The endless woods","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1khxh6o\/the_endless_woods\/","flair":null,"author":"im_brudakku-2","selftext":"The forest stretched out before me like a sea of shadows, trees clustered so tightly their branches seemed to clutch at one another. I stared at the path if you could call it that, a thin thread of dirt winding its way between trunks older than anything I\u2019d ever seen. The air was still, heavy with the scent of damp earth and moss. I took a deep breath, letting the chill of the morning settle into my bones before stepping forward.\n\nI had come here for solitude, a retreat from the noise of the city, the smog stained skyline, the endless blur of faces that never meant anything. I told myself it would be good for me, that I needed time to think. But as I moved deeper into the woods, that sense of calm I\u2019d hoped for began to fray, unraveling at the edges with every step.\n\nThe first mile or so was easy. The trees were familiar, maples and oaks, their leaves whispering in the faint breeze. Sunlight speared through gaps in the canopy, dappling the ground in shifting patterns. I paused occasionally to look back, catching glimpses of the trailhead, the car parked just beyond it, gleaming silver in the sunlight. A reminder of the world I\u2019d left behind, if only for a few days.\n\nBut soon the path narrowed, its borders blurred by overgrown brush and creeping vines. I hesitated, glancing back once more. The car was gone from view, swallowed by the folds of the landscape. For a moment, I considered turning back just for a moment. But then I laughed, shaking off the creeping unease that clawed at my chest. I\u2019d read too many ghost stories as a kid. That was all it was.\n\nThe trail became more jagged, roots knotting through the soil like skeletal fingers, rocks jutting out at odd angles. I picked my way through carefully, eyes scanning for any sign of markers or trail blazes. I hadn\u2019t seen any since I\u2019d started, but that wasn\u2019t unusual. Some of these old paths were hardly maintained.\n\nThe sun climbed higher, its light filtering through the canopy in thin threads. I checked my watch\u2014eleven past noon. I should have been coming up on the clearing by now, a small patch of open ground I\u2019d seen on the map. But the trees only grew denser, the path winding in unpredictable twists and turns.\n\nI stopped and listened. The woods were silent. No birds, no rustle of squirrels in the underbrush, not even the drone of insects. Just silence. My breath sounded harsh in my own ears, a reminder of how far I\u2019d come. I pulled out my phone, glancing at the screen. No signal, of course. Not out here.\n\nI turned back the way I\u2019d come, expecting to see the familiar twists and bends, but the path was different. It veered off to the left where I was sure it had been straight before. I hesitated, staring down the new line of trees that framed the path. Had I really come that way?\n\nA flutter of unease crept in, but I shoved it aside. I must have gotten turned around. It was easy enough to do out here. I retraced my steps, moving quickly now, more certain with every stride. I watched the trees, looking for familiar markings\u2014anything to ground me. But there was nothing.\n\nI paused, heart pounding a little harder than it should have been. I was alone. Completely alone. I took a breath, forcing my mind to still. It was fine. I just needed to backtrack further. I turned again, but the path was gone. Where it had been, there was only underbrush and towering trees, their branches stretching toward one another like bony arms.\n\nI stepped forward, pushing through the foliage. There had to be a trail here. I\u2019d walked it. I\u2019d seen it. My hands shoved branches aside, leaves brushing against my skin like whispers. But there was nothing. No path. Just more trees.\n\nI stopped and looked around. The sun was still overhead, but its light felt muted, distant. I took another breath, slower this time, and told myself to calm down. Panic wouldn\u2019t help. It never did. I just needed to get my bearings.\n\nI turned in a slow circle, marking the direction where the sun hung, and started walking straight. If I kept moving in one direction, I\u2019d have to hit a road, or at the very least, the edge of the woods. That was how it worked.\n\nI walked for what felt like hours. The trees grew thicker, their trunks gnarled and twisted, roots sprawling across the ground like veins. My footsteps grew heavier, the silence pressing against my ears until it felt like I was underwater. I checked my watch. Three-thirty. I\u2019d been walking for nearly four hours.\n\nI stopped. The panic was harder to push away this time, clawing up my throat with every breath. I glanced around. Nothing but trees. Endless, unbroken lines of trees. My heart thudded against my ribs, my hands shaking as I fumbled for my phone. I held it up, staring at the screen. Still no signal. The battery was down to sixty percent.\n\nI swallowed, forcing my breathing to slow. I was just lost. That was all. I\u2019d gotten turned around, maybe wandered off the path, but I\u2019d find it again. I had to.\n\nBut when I turned back, the path I\u2019d taken was gone. Not just overgrown\u2014gone. As if it had never been there. The underbrush was untouched, the leaves undisturbed. I took a step back, and then another. My mind spun, grasping for logic, for reason, but none came.\n\nI was alone, in the middle of the woods, and I had no idea how to get out.\n\nMy breath came quicker now, my vision blurring at the edges as I fought to keep calm. I forced my legs to move, stumbling forward through the brush. I picked a direction and walked. And walked.\n\nHours bled into one another. The sun sank lower, shadows stretching like fingers across the ground. I trudged forward, exhaustion gnawing at my bones, my throat raw from thirst. I tried to drink from a stream I found, the water clear and cold, but it only made me more aware of how alone I was.\n\nWhen the sun finally dipped behind the horizon, the darkness came swift and total. I huddled beneath the trunk of a massive oak, its roots curling around me like ribs. The night was colder than I\u2019d expected, and I shivered beneath my thin jacket. I listened, waiting for the sounds of the forest to wake the croak of frogs, the rustle of leaves, the distant howl of some nighttime predator.\n\nBut there was only silence. A silence so complete it pressed against my ears, filling the space where sound should be. I didn\u2019t sleep.\n\nWhen the dawn came, gray and thin, I rose on stiff legs and continued on. My body ached, my feet raw from endless walking. I checked my watch. Seven-thirty. My phone was down to thirty percent. Still no signal.\n\nI moved through the trees, ignoring the whispers of panic that clawed at my thoughts. I just had to keep moving. That was what mattered. If I kept moving, I\u2019d find the edge. I had to.\n\nBut the trees never ended.\n\nThey stretched on, twisting and knotting around one another, the path long forgotten. I stopped marking the hours, my steps blurring together into a haze of motion. I drank from streams when I found them, ate wild berries that stained my fingers crimson. I knew the dangers of it, the risks of poison, but hunger gnawed at my stomach with sharp teeth.\n\nDays passed. Or maybe it was only hours. The light barely changed, the sun hovering just beyond the trees, never quite reaching the ground. My watch died. My phone followed soon after. I stopped caring about direction. I just walked.\n\nThe trees grew stranger as I moved forward, their bark smooth and pale, their branches bare despite the season. Leaves carpeted the ground, thick and wet, muffling my footsteps until I felt like I was moving through a dream.\n\nI tried to scream once, to shatter the silence. My voice broke the air, raw and jagged, but the trees swallowed it whole.

When a five year old gets washed into a cave, and there is a two-week search, it tends to get attention.\n\nI never wanted condolences.\u00a0 I wanted closure.\u00a0 Even if he was dead, I needed to see his body.\u00a0 The thought that he could have died down there, alone and in the dark, was unacceptable to me.\n\nWhen they stopped searching after two weeks, my only thought was that it would take someone longer than that to starve to death.\u00a0 There was plenty of water down there; if he had been washed into an inaccessible part of the cave, then he could still be alive.\u00a0 My dad had to physically keep me from trying to go back into the cave myself, to tell me that it was over, that he was gone.\u00a0 In my heart, I didn\u2019t believe he was dead.\n\nI was sixteen at the time, a junior in high school.\u00a0 Kieran had been an oops baby, eleven years younger than me.\u00a0 He was the sweetest kid, even though he was insane.\u00a0 At age four, he\u2019d broken a leg and an arm falling about thirty feet out of a tree he had managed to climb.\u00a0 He was always running around climbing and jumping off of things, yelling and laughing.\n\nHe probably had ADHD in retrospect, but at the time he annoyed the shit out of me.\u00a0 I would try to do homework, and he would basically whirlwind into my room like the tasmanian devil from the cartoons, jumping on the bed and tackling me.\u00a0 He wanted a big brother, but the age gap made it hard for us to bond.\u00a0 Any of my spare time after marching band and homework was spent trying (unsuccessfully) to get a girlfriend, and I didn\u2019t treat him the way I should have.\n\nTwo years later, after a lot of therapy, I\u2019ve stopped blaming myself as much.\u00a0 I know that it was natural to act the way I did, to feel the way I did.\u00a0 That even if he annoyed me, it didn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t love him, deeply.\u00a0 I know that I did.\u00a0 I know that I still do.\n\nWhen I went to UT for college, I met a couple people who were into spelunking.\u00a0 They didn\u2019t know about my brother, and I never told them.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t bring myself to tell my parents, knowing what they would think.\u00a0 But I picked it up fast, with a conviction that I knew was illogical.\u00a0 I wanted to find his body, or find him.\n\nIt was denial, I knew that much.\u00a0 But I had nightmares about him, nightmares that he was in that cave, in the dark screaming my name, but I couldn\u2019t find him.\u00a0 After nearly three years, they never stopped.\u00a0 My therapist had a whole bunch of thoughts on the matter, as did my parents.\u00a0 But I knew what would give me peace, in a way that nothing else could: finding his body.\n\nPartway through my freshman year, an opportunity presented itself.\u00a0 Kieran had fallen into a creek that went underground.\u00a0 Since then, we had had record drought, and the creek was nearly dry.\u00a0 More than two years before, the team had explored everything they could, but the path of the water was not navigable.\u00a0 It was a tunnel completely filled with a fast current, too dangerous to try and send anyone down even with scuba gear.\n\nI needed to see what it looked like now.\u00a0 I should have told someone I was doing it, even just my friends that taught me caving.\u00a0 Instead, I drove back to my parents neighborhood, took a dirt road into the forest, parked my car, and went back to the cave.\n\nFor anyone not from that part of the country, it\u2019s all limestone.\u00a0 Water eats through it easily, and there are caves everywhere.\u00a0 Most of them aren\u2019t as deep as this particular, but it\u2019s normal if you have a few acres of land to have a cave on it.\u00a0 This particular one was in a gully a couple hundred yards from the house I grew up in.\n\nGetting my gear out of the trunk, I walked through the familiar hickory and maples, feet crunching on the dry leaves, down the rocky hill to the creek.\n\nThe mouth of the cave was small, only about two feet high and three feet wide.\u00a0 I could still picture the yellow tape, the police officers directing volunteer search parties day and night. Standing there in the quiet forest, I stared at that black opening, as I had so many times.\u00a0 Even though the cave was significant, they\u2019d already explored everything they could, mapped it thoroughly.\n\nThe water didn\u2019t even go over the top of the rocks in the bottom of it as I crawled through without getting wet, besides a little mud.\u00a0 I had the cave maps they made memorized, but still carried a laminated copy.\u00a0 Following the weak trickle of water, I crawled a little ways, until the ceiling got high enough to walk if you kept your head down.\u00a0 All I had to do was follow the water about one hundred feet, then see if the tunnel was clear.\u00a0 That was the only way his body could be.\n\nIt smelled earthy, with decaying leaves in the weak flow.\u00a0 Looking back over my shoulder, I turned a bend and saw the last bit of reflected sunlight fade out of existence, leaving only my headlamp.\u00a0 Watching my step on the slick muddy rock, a little salamander wriggled out of the way through the silty water.\n\nMy heart was pounding in my chest as I made my way deeper into the earth, seeing how little water there was.\u00a0 Every inch of the cave had been checked, except for where I was headed.\u00a0 If the passage was clear, I would be the first person to ever go into that part of the cave.\u00a0 Well, the second.\n\nThe black hole was shaped like an oval, a little over a foot tall and about two feet wide.\u00a0 One to two inches of water ran down the bottom of it.\u00a0 A knot formed in my throat, half feeling like I would cry and half feeling like I was scared.\u00a0 I knew that I should get someone else, but I couldn\u2019t stand thinking about what they would say.\u00a0 They would say there was no point, that the body would be washed too deep or buried, and that it could be too dangerous, and to let a professional do it.\n\nInstead of getting help, I began to drill.\u00a0 The rock was all limestone, and it didn\u2019t take too long to get two secure bolts drilled to anchor my rope.\u00a0 I put on my harness, and got onto my stomach.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to tell just how steep slopes are in a cave, but the water gave me a good idea.\u00a0 I would be squeezing through this hole, and essentially repelling down.\n\nLooking in with my headlamp, it seemed like the top was a narrow point, and that it might open up.\u00a0 I\u2019d never done anything this tight and steep with water in it, but something pushed me into that black opening, where I could hear water falling far below: night after night of dreaming Kieran was down there alone, screaming, terrified.\n\nIt was a tight squeeze, tighter than I liked.\u00a0 To repel, I had to have my face down toward the water, and turn my head so that I could breathe.\u00a0 I inched down, struggling to use the equipment in the tight space.\u00a0 Progress was painfully slow, as I had to try and turn myself onto my left hip to reach the ATC scraping into the rock on my stomach.\n\nGetting out wouldn\u2019t be any easier.\n\nThe rock pressed in on me, harder and harder as the angle got steeper and steeper.\u00a0 I was essentially in a tiny tube with a waterfall, going more and more vertical.\u00a0 My problem was that the tube was not equally wide in all places; it was carved by water, and would get narrower or wider on whims that I couldn\u2019t predict.\u00a0 I\u2019d heard horror stories of Nutty Putty cave, where the caver got stuck in a vertical shaft like this one, and it didn\u2019t help.\n\nI was coming up on the narrowest part yet, but it looked like it would open up below that.\u00a0 I\u2019d taken my helmet off, so that I could squeeze through better.\u00a0 In the tight space with the water splashing my face and running through my shirt and pants, I began to feel fear.\n\nNot fear like you feel standing near a ledge; that\u2019s a manageable type of fear you can step back from.\u00a0 Not a fear that you feel in the pitch black, unsure of what\u2019s around you; you can just find a light.\n\nThis was a fear beyond that.\u00a0 A fear that each foot of vertical rock builds incrementally inside of you, as you know your escape becomes harder and harder.\u00a0 A fear that each pound of pressure as the rock smashes into your chest so that you can\u2019t breathe increases.\u00a0 A fear that right here, right now, if you panic, you will die.\n\nI promised myself that my parents wouldn\u2019t lose two sons to this cave.\u00a0 That if it got any tighter, any steeper, I would turn around.\n\nJust before my will broke, my chest scraped through a tight spot, and the tunnel began to open.\u00a0 I almost dropped by helmet down the shaft, but managed to put it back on.\u00a0 From the sound of the water falling, I could tell I was entering a large chamber.\n\nShining my light around, there was a domed ceiling with a few small stalactites.\u00a0 A huge, murky pool of water was below me, and I couldn\u2019t see how deep it was.\u00a0 Large rocks were piled around the edges, and it seemed like the water was shallower on the other side.\u00a0 I repelled down, until my feet hit the water.\u00a0 They just kept going down, and down, until I was chest deep and stopped feeding rope.\u00a0 There was no way to know how deep the pool was, but I knew I would have to swim.\n\nThe rope was my lifeline, and I couldn\u2019t leave it.\u00a0 I did an awkward sidestroke, pulling with one arm and trying to feed out rope with the other underwater.\u00a0 I\u2019d never tried it before, and I wouldn\u2019t recommend it.\u00a0 It sort of felt like I was going to drown, the weight of my clothes and shoes and the rope making it nearly impossible.\u00a0 Eventually, I made it thirty or so feet away from the waterfall, and felt my boots start to sink into silty mud.\n\nDrenched and breathing hard, I found a rock to sit on.\u00a0 I felt as if I might throw up from the exertion, now that the adrenaline was wearing off.\n\nA new sort of dread filled me as I looked around.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a small cave system, and I could hear the water going even deeper.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t be sure, but it looked like there were other tunnels, made by other water sources meeting up with this one.\u00a0 Should I follow the main current, as that was likely where Kieran\u2019s body would have gone?\u00a0 Or should I try to thoroughly map every tunnel I could find, branching off of this chamber?\n\nThe memory of his loss was fresh in my mind, but it had been almost three years.\u00a0 What would I be looking for, what would be left of his body?\u00a0 Scraps of clothing or bones.\u00a0 Regardless of what my dreams told me, what else could there be?\n\nI had decided to take a few minutes to rest, to gather my thoughts.\u00a0 Rushing things wouldn\u2019t help.\u00a0 The sound of water was a white noise, and I began to look around more calmly.\u00a0 I noticed a pale little fish swimming in the murky pool in front of me.\n\nAll I can remember was a loud cracking sound.\n\nThank God I was wearing my helmet, or I would have been dead.\u00a0 It\u2019s strange how when you get hit on the head, you can lose your sight and sense of balance, but still hear things.\u00a0 I was shocked, but knew that I must have a concussion.\u00a0 There\u2019s no way for me to know if I was unconscious for a second, or a minute, but I tried to scramble back to my feet in a panic.\n\nA rock had struck me, from above.\u00a0 It must have come off of the steep side of the chamber, from a hidden ledge.\u00a0 My leg was hurt, I could tell that much.\u00a0 There was a sharp, pulsing pain on my calf that I\u2019d never felt; it was bad.\u00a0 I kicked my leg by reflex, only realizing consciously what my instincts had already figured out, only seeing the impossible as my dazed head turned around, and a scream escaped my mouth.\n\nHe was eating me.\n\nThe emaciated boy was pale as death, bloody teeth digging into my leg.\u00a0 Blind eyes were wide open, deep in their sockets, above sunken cheeks.\u00a0 Over and over he bit me, with a hunger I could never understand.\u00a0 His arms were smaller than my wrists, his collar bones sticking from his chest.\u00a0 I grabbed his shoulder, and threw him off of me in terror.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t have weighed thirty pounds.\n\nFor a second I saw him stand, my blood dripping from his mouth and over the ribs of his chest, before he ran into the darkness.\n\n\u201cKieran!\u201d\n\nI screamed his name at the top of my lungs, went to chase him.\u00a0 Still confused from the head trauma, I was yanked backwards by the rope still attached to my harness.\u00a0 I frantically unlocked the carabiner, and ran the way he had gone, ignoring the pain in my leg.\u00a0 Drops of black blood lead me to a low, narrow tunnel.\n\nIn my headlamp, I saw his little feet disappearing around a corner.\u00a0 The crack he had squeezed through was impossibly small, I could never fit into it.\n\n\u201cKieran, it\u2019s me!\u00a0 It\u2019s Chris!\u00a0 It\u2019s me!\u201d\n\nI began sobbing.\u00a0 Why couldn\u2019t I have grabbed him?\u00a0 If I\u2019d just grabbed one of those tiny arms I could have hugged him, told him I loved him, brought him back to the sun.\n\n\u201cMom and Dad love you, they miss you.\u00a0 I miss you!\u201d\u00a0 I yelled over the sound of the waterfall.\n\nI kept saying anything I could think of.\u00a0 I said that I had food; tried to wrinkle the wrapper of a granola bar as loudly as I could.\u00a0 Told him that he could go home, screamed until I collapsed on the wet rock.\n\nIn my mind, the last almost three years had been hard; what were they for him, alone in the dark, eating anything that swam or crawled he could get his hands on?\u00a0 He was only five at the time, and would be almost eight now.\u00a0 Would he be insane?\u00a0 Remember who I was, or even who he himself was?\n\nLooking down, a trickle of blood went into the main pool, dying it a dark color at the edge.\u00a0 I was bleeding, a lot.\u00a0 If I didn\u2019t stop it, I wouldn\u2019t make the climb back up, and no one would know that either of us was down here.\n\nWrapping the leg as tightly as I could, it kept bleeding.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t really have the tools to make a proper tourniquet, but tightened the knot as hard as I could, until I screamed.\u00a0 Before I went, I left the granola bar unwrapped at the base of the crack Kieran had gone through, along with a spare headlamp turned on to the lowest setting.\u00a0 I screamed that I would be back, promised him, before eventually turning back to the pool.\n\nI pulled myself along the rope to the base of the waterfall.\u00a0 Painfully, I made my way back up it, and somehow squeezed through the crack.\u00a0 I barely remember, to be honest, just the suffering of it, and wanting to give up.\n\nI didn\u2019t give up though.\u00a0 Half for myself, and half for Kieran.\n\nAt the mouth of the cave, I collapsed.\u00a0 Seeing the sun brought me to my senses just a little.\u00a0 I called my mom, and she answered.\u00a0 I told her I was at the cave, out back, that I was hurt.\u00a0 That I had found Kieran.\u00a0 I told her to call an ambulance.\n\nThe leg is okay.\u00a0 I will be able to use it just fine, even though the scar will never heal.\u00a0 There was too much tissue missing.\n\nAt the hospital, the doctors agreed that the injury on my leg was from being bitten, probably by a child based on the tooth marks.\u00a0 That fact alone was the only reason I could convince anyone that he was still down there, still alive.\u00a0 It seemed impossible, but he must have been eating the fish, or anything else he could find.\n\nThey sent down a search party, but no one can fit into a lot of the tunnels he might have gone down.\n\nMy parents are a wreck, understandably.\u00a0 Even three days later, my dad is hysterical and my mom is just quiet.\u00a0 They wanted to go down, to try and talk to him, but there\u2019s no way they would make the climb.\u00a0 I barely did.\n\nThe rescue teams couldn\u2019t find him, and the tunnel is completely impassable to anyone other than a starved child.\u00a0 No one has seen him, but they put food in the crack I last saw him in, and when they came back the next day, it was gone.\n\nI never gave up on him, and I still haven\u2019t.\u00a0 Right now the plan is to leave as much food as we can, and hope that the rain forecast tomorrow isn\u2019t enough to fill the cave.\n\n  \n[\u2026more](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/patrickmullensauthor\/s\/qEF252JtVs)"},"56":{"title":"I record dreams for living","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kherme\/i_record_dreams_for_living\/","flair":null,"author":"Willing_Procedure_34","selftext":"\n\nThree months ago, I got a job offer from a company I\u2019d never heard of.\nNo interview.

I was two months behind on rent and tired of grinding delivery apps and night shifts at a gas station.

I get paid to pull the hairs. Down in the tunnels, far below the city, they grow in clumps. \u201cI don't pay you to ask questions\u201d is what my boss told me on day one. Seemed fair enough, the pay was good, and what I was doing didn't seem particularly harmful. \n\nBefore work every day I would put on the suit, the boots, the oxygen mask, grab the equipment, and journey down into the tunnels to pull hair. When you first get in, it seems like a normal tunnel system, like one that'd lead to a subway system. \n\nBut all that it led to was more corridors, miles and miles of branching concrete pathways leading nowhere but back into each other. It's an anxious feeling, hearing the sound of rushing cars on the highway above, completely isolated in the dark tunnels in a heavy suit. \n\nI was comforted a few weeks into the job by sneaking my phone into my suit to listen to podcasts, something they said I wasn't allowed to do. \u201cfor your own safety, you should hear\u201d my boss would say. \n\nPartways in, after about 5 minutes of walking, all sound and air from the outside world was suddenly cut off, and I'd have to put on my mask. It was impossibly dark, and incredibly lonely. \n\nIt was at this depth that you'd start to see the bristles, little black strands of hair poking out of the floor, walls and ceiling. They wouldn't move much, only twitching and jittering slightly as you touched them. Unsettling as they may be, they're nothing to worry about. \n\nThough one time I recall failing to put on my gloves before getting to that depth, and curiously touching one of the bristles. Big mistake, I couldn't get the hair out of my finger for months. The guys gave me shit for it, calling me \u201cpube finger\u201d. \n\nAt least my case wasn't as bad as \u201cdog boy\u201d, the poor kid never showed up to work again. Occasionally the bristles would need shaving, but that wasn't my job, I still had a ways to go. At some point I'd reach a stairwell, and the bristles would increase in length and frequency. \n\nAs the hairs increased in size, so did their movement. They twirled and wriggled weakly, making soft scraping noises as they brushed against the concrete and each other. \n\nThis point would always make my own hair stand on end, something about the millions of tiny strands moving on their own deeply unsettled me. I would usually pick up my pace to get through this portion of the tunnels, as my job still lay further down. \n\nI once spoke with Dale, someone who's position lies in this portion of the tunnels. He said he got a strange satisfaction from yanking those squirming hairs from where they grew. And though I wouldn't personally call my job \u201csatisfying\u201d, it wasn't hard to understand what he was talking about. \n\nAfter a few turns, left, right, down, left again, I'd reach another stairwell. Only a few more floors to go. It was at this point that it became difficult to walk. The hairs were long enough to the point that they'd tangle and catch your legs, and trip you if you weren't careful. \n\nThey were perhaps too big to move properly, erratic squirming and wriggling was now reduced to light and meagre jolts and jitters. The hairs coiled on the ground and draped from the ceiling, the concrete they sprouted from almost unseeable. \n\nTrudging through thick clumps of incredibly sturdy strands of hair, it's easy to get a little frustrated. I remember one time, my first day actually, I tripped and fell flat into the hair. \n\nI panicked and writhed as the hairs seemed to instinctively wrap around my body, pinning me to the ground. Luckily we have tools to deal with such situations. This was definitely my least favorite part of the tunnels. \n\nDetermined to reach the end, I'd make one final push, and finally reach the last stretch. One more stairway down, I had finally reached my destination, and could begin my work. At this point in the tunnels, the space opened up into a wide open room, with pillars rising to the ceiling. \n\nThe hair, now too big to move, dangled from the ceiling in long, thick ropes, and pooled in an ocean on the floor. I would spend the next few hours grabbing as much hair as I could, and yanking hard. It would strain and struggle, fused to the concrete. \n\nI had gotten so good that I only needed to wrap some around my arm, and pull as hard as I could to yank huge clumps of hair down from the ceiling, and stuff it into a large bag. I'd nearly break my back bending over and pulling it from the floor as well. \n\nI would then begin the fifteen minute walk back up the complex of hallways and stairwells, dumping all the hair into the truck, then journeying back down to pull more hair. It was strenuous, and I'd come home fatigued, but it's good exercise I guess. \n\nIt was easy to get lonely all the way down there, though I can't say I'd be happy to meet another person there. Which is why my most recent shift has seriously disturbed me. \n\nAs I was stuffing the last bag full of hair, and ready to leave the tunnels for the day, I heard someone talking. I took my earbuds out, and turned off my phone to make sure I wasn't hearing things. \n\nSure enough, further into the darkness, beyond my line of work, I heard the sound of a man mumbling to himself. \u201cHello?\u201d I called out. Though my voice was muffled by the mask, they definitely heard me, as their speaking stopped immediately after. \n\nI was hesitant to check out the source of the voice, as the sound emanated further down in the tunnels then I was instructed to go. To my knowledge, I had four coworkers who worked in these tunnels at alternating times, each with our own assigned layer. \n\nDale, George and Isaac worked on the layers above mine. I talked with them often, we joked and theorized about our own job, about how weird it was and how we could possibly get paid so much when it didn't seem like we were doing anything. \n\nI feel like they've become good friends of mine in my time working here. Henry, who worked in the layer just below mine, didn't speak to anyone. I only recently found out his name. \n\nI suspected the voice I heard down there might be his, who else could it be? \u201cUnder no circumstances, should any of you be in the tunnels at the same time\u201d my boss told me. \n\nI could have just left, but I wanted to make sure Henry wasn't occupying the same space when we were strictly told not to. I trudged through the thick hair, and walked further into the tunnel than I had ever bothered to go before. \n\nLeaving the wide open room, it lead into a circular tunnel, unlike anything I've seen before. What was most odd was the further down the tunnel I went, the length and frequency of the growing hair began to shrink, and disappeared completely. \n\nIt was now simply a dark, echoey concrete tunnel, hairless, I suppose like a tunnel should be. After minutes of walking through the straight, barren tunnel, I heard the mumbling again. \n\nI saw him, standing in the dark, speaking to nobody. \u201cHow about we snap you in fucking half? I don't care. It's not like you need to be alive anyway.\u201d He spat feverishly, facing away from me.\n\n\u201cAre\u2026 you talking to me?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cOF COURSE I'M-\u201d Henry whipped around and screamed, before his face relaxed upon seeing me. \u201cOh. You. I thought you were\u2026 someone else.\u201d He whispered. I winced upon his sudden outburst. \n\nI then raised an eyebrow at his presence in this tunnel. Strangely, he wasn't wearing a suit, nor did he carry anything with him. He also looked strained, like one of the veins in his forehead would burst at any moment. \n\n\u201cAre you supposed to be down here?\u201d I inquired. Henry closed his drooling mouth and straightened up.\n\u201cNobody is.\u201d He said solemnly. After an awkward silence, he began moving towards me, then walked right by. \n\nI followed after, the two of us wordlessly trekking back up through the tunnels of hair. Freakishly, though Henry wore no suit, the hairs didn't seem to stick to him like they normally should. \n\nAs he walked by, they avoided him like the same side of a magnet, pushing away with every step and movement. I didn't say a signal word the whole way out, I didn't get paid to ask questions. \n\nWe stepped out into the sun, and I loaded the last bag into the truck. Henry just stood there, staring out into the sky. I took off all my equipment and walked over to him.\n\u201cYou alright?\u201d I questioned. Henry turned to me slowly, his expression gaunt and aged.\n\n\u201cI remember, when I was in my early twenties, I was freaking out over my hair.\u201d Henry began, rubbing his bald head with his hand. \u201cI was losing all my hair, and I hated it. I hated everyone and everything. It's hard to say going bald was the reason for that, but it's definitely what I fixated on.\u201d \nI listened intently to Henry's story, fascinated because I had never heard him speak before. \u201cI even tried killing myself one night, over my hair! Isn't that ridiculous!?\u201d Henry admitted. \n\nI didn't know what to say, I just nodded. Henry's face soured, maybe realizing he shared too much. He then walked over to the truck and rested his hands on it. \u201cAnyway, it's been a long day, you should take this with you.\u201d \n\nHenry reeled back his head, and I heard a low tremble. His whole body began to violently shake, and his eyes rolled into the back of his head. I took a step back nervously as he began to gurgle and howl, his skin turning red. \n\nAll at once, he heaved forward and an impossible amount of hair began shooting out of his mouth like a cascade. Meters and meters and meters and meters of thick black hair flew out from his throat and coiled in the back of the truck. \n\nMy jaw nearly hit the floor watching the scene, a disgusting waterfall of hair streaming without cease. After a full minute of Henry convulsing, puking up hundreds of pounds of hair into the truck. \n\nHe stopped. He wiped his mouth, said \u201csee ya\u201d, then left. I anxiously returned to base with the hull. The boss didn't question the unprecedented amount of hair I had come back with. \n\nIf anything he seemed pleased, speaking of giving me a \u2018promotion\u2019. I don't know, I think it might be time to get a new job. But I'll consider it.\n"},"58":{"title":"My high school bestie crossed the line","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kh8bvn\/my_high_school_bestie_crossed_the_line\/","flair":null,"author":"pumpkindawg","selftext":"She always questioned why I was wearing make-up.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIs it for a boy?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy are you wearing it today and not yesterday?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy are you doing it different today?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBack in high school I could never catch a break from her. She was my best friend since middle school and there were literally zero boundaries between us in her mind. We had the same classes, sang in chorus together and went to the same church.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut even though her questions like these were irksome, it was best to not confront her head-on, which I think I always knew subconsciously, even before knowing what I do now.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI have a taciturn and deeply non-confrontational personality, so back then I would rather die than to say the truth, which is to say I\u2019d never admit to wanting to look attractive out loud.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo I\u2019d pretend that I did my make-up absentmindedly just to end the conversation. We basically did the same song-and-dance every time I wore make-up. I found that it was just easier to lie. Or more often than not, just to not wear it, my looks and self-esteem be damned.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\u00a0\n\nMore than anything these are the things that I remember about my early high school days. When I think back to all those drawn-out hours with her at school, carpool, chorus events, summer camps, I remember specific things like her questions about my make-up, any changes to my hair, new clothes, etc. And not to sound like a Queen Bee but it also seemed like if I bought anything new, she would too \u2014 jewelry, Keds, dresses, ringtones for my cell phone.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe had plenty of laughs and good times too, but the feelings that have persisted are the ones of insecurity and exhaustion from avoiding being on her bad side.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI also remember her being a really tough hang. I couldn\u2019t bring any new friends or acquaintances around. She was loud, talkative and needlessly abrasive to new people. If you looked up \u201cRBF\u201d in a dictionary, you\u2019d see a picture of her being around someone she didn\u2019t know already.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe was also an over-sharer, especially with gross body stuff, and an over-communicator. I couldn\u2019t log onto AIM without her already being there, literally at all hours of the night. She called anytime she was driving from one place to another. And I learned that it was better to always answer, even if it was terrible timing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOne time, I passive aggressively didn\u2019t answer when she called. After 5 minutes I gave her a call back \u2014 she didn\u2019t answer. But she returned my call immediately. I didn\u2019t answer her again and then called her right back.\n\n\u00a0\n\nGuess what, she didn\u2019t answer but again she called me right back.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe did this back and forth a couple more times \u2014 it felt obnoxious in the moment and even more so in hindsight. I came to the conclusion that she would never answer when I called, she\u2019d only call me.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOne time I literally couldn\u2019t bring myself to answer; I was in one of those moods where I couldn\u2019t stomach even a 5-minute conversation. So I text her and said I couldn\u2019t talk and asked what was up. She never text me back and literally didn\u2019t speak to me for an entire week. Apparently, she \u201cwas going through something and really needed me that day\u201d but honestly I don\u2019t believe that it was anything out of the ordinary.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t remember what eventually broke the silence between us after that tiff, but I remember feeling happy that we were on speaking terms again. After less than a day it was like it never happened.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow, to the day that changed everything. It was a normal school day in late April; definitely in that post-Spring Break season where the sun is shining and it\u2019s torture to be cooped up in a classroom.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnother one of her \u201cquirks\u201d is that she *had* to know what I scored on every test and likewise would tell me what she scored. It was a frustrating expectation of hers. She had a habit of calling herself \u201can intellectual\u201d \u2014 without even a hint of irony, mind you \u2014 but in truth she was very, very smart so she usually scored higher than I did.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut one time in English I aced a test while she got something worse but respectable, like an 87. She asked what I got as soon as the teacher gave me my test back. I pretended not to hear her and put it facedown on my desk while I rummaged in my backpack.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn a flash she stood up, reached across and grabbed my test before I knew what was happening. It was all so aggressive and happened so rapidly that I couldn\u2019t help but shoot her a nasty \u201cwhat the hell\u201d kind of look.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI remember us having an uncomfortable beat or two of eye contact and then her looking at my test. After which her face darkened, severely. Whether it was my test result or my honest reaction to her invading my privacy and personal space, I had deeply offended her. What made matters worse is that everyone noticed since it was a sort of violent disruption to a quiet classroom.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter that incident, again I got the silent treatment, but this stretched for more than two weeks. She was not speaking to me in the mornings at carpool, she skipped chorus events and at school it was just strange.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI would look in her direction and she\u2019d pretend to not notice me. But when I wasn\u2019t looking I could feel her watching me. It was so weird, but I was not in a hurry to mend fences with her.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOne day after school I got a text from her. This was so many years \u2014 and phones \u2014\u00a0ago so I don\u2019t remember specifics, but it had something to do with a school assignment. There was no apology or warmth, or even an attempt to awkwardly address the situation.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe text was so random and I felt like she was fishing for a reaction, so I didn\u2019t answer. I wanted to actually have a conversation, and if she couldn\u2019t handle that then I was also fine just moving on. I wasn\u2019t going to let her dictate how we were going to resolve things.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLater that night, she sent another a message on AIM \u00a0that asked if I saw her text and also if she could come over right then. I logged off immediately so I wouldn\u2019t feel compelled to answer, it was all really weird.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe wasn\u2019t at school the next day. I didn\u2019t think too much of it except that it was refreshing to not have to ignore her for a full school day.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat afternoon, one of our assistant principals showed up to my Biology classroom and asked for me to accompany him to the principal\u2019s office. My principal began asking me questions about my friend and about her interest in computers, which I didn\u2019t know how to answer. I said that she\u2019s a whiz at AIM but that\u2019s about all I knew.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTurns out, my friend had made a hit list naming me directly. My principal had printed it out for me to read, and it was some of the most vulgar things I\u2019ve ever read. He explained that she tried using an offshore router in her email to the school the day before, but they were able to easily pinpoint her IP address and alert the actual authorities.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFrom there my recollection gets blurry, but I remember getting a police escort home from school that day with a helicopter overhead and everything. She was sent to juvenile detention and then eventually to a girls-only mental institution in Florida for a short stint.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t think she was ever formally convicted, but she was expelled. Her family moved that summer a few towns away and enrolled her at a private school.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMy principal would check in with me randomly from that point until I graduated a few years later. I think he did that because he wanted to let me know that the administration was thinking about me, but I\u2019m sure he was also angling to see if I received any threats, which I thankfully never did.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo many years have passed, and I honestly don\u2019t think about those days too often. They were confusing and frustrating years, and the meeting with the principal and the fallout with my friend happened in quick succession.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEvery now and again I\u2019ll see her on social media and her name comes up here and there in conversations with family or old friends.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m writing this all to give context:\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe just messaged me on social media, and I\u2019m not sure what to do."},"59":{"title":"Marble Veins","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1khg1dv\/marble_veins\/","flair":null,"author":"PTVincent","selftext":"I\u2019ll remember that night forever; jet black eyes, ash in my lungs. It still watches me\n\nIt began in second grade, on a morning so normal I almost forgot it. I tied my shoes, slapped together a peanut\u2011butter\u2011and\u2011jelly sandwich, and packed my brand\u2011new Spider\u2011Man backpack.\n\nBy the time I boarded the bus to the museum, excitement ran throughout my body like electricity. I bounced out of the cracked leather seat and leaned so far out of the aisle I almost fell. That\u2019s when the old bus driver, Miss Marge, cracked her raspy voice like a whip from the front of the bus: \u201cSit down!\u201d\n\nI dropped back into my seat. Her deep, sunken eyes and the smoky scent that lingered around her were enough to pause my heartbeat. Luckily, I had Landon beside me. We\u2019d met on the first day of school, where we bonded over Ben 10 and our Pok\u00e9mon cards. Now, he gave me a teasing grin that told me to behave.\n\n\u201cShe scares me,\u201d I whispered to Landon, ducking my head while peering around the seat at Miss Marge\u2019s rigid silhouette. Her knuckles were white as bone as she gripped the dark rubber of the wheel.\n\nWhen we arrived at the museum, we gathered with the teachers and chaperones in front of the museum\u2019s decorated entrance. They started to divide us into groups of three, assigning us the job of looking after one another and keeping each other in check. I was excited when Ms. Landers met my eyes and called my name.\n\n\u201cDavid, you\u2019re going to be in a group with Landon\u2026\u201d She glanced around, searching for any other students who hadn\u2019t found their pod yet. My heart sank as I realized only one classmate remained unassigned. \u201c\u2026was Jenny.\u201d\n\nTo put it kindly, Jenny was a troublemaker. Last week, she had put gum in a classmate's hair, and they had to cut it out. I\u2019d never willingly spoken to her before, but now I had no choice. Under Ms. Landers watchful gaze, I forced myself forward. My palms began sweating as I approached her, extending my hand, but before I could say a word, she pushed me away, eyes narrowed with irritation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not talking to either of you\u201d Jenny hissed before disappearing into the swarm of students. Ms. Landers gave a weary sigh. I could tell she was exhausted from dealing with rowdy kids, and Jenny was just another burden on her shoulders. Leaning down to my level, she spoke gently.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll talk to her about her behavior,\u201d she said. \u201cLet me know if you have any trouble with her during the tour\u2014I\u2019ll help right away.\u201d I nodded, relieved to know I had backup if things went sideways.\n\nThe tour around the museum was exciting; the halls were decorated and loomed far over our heads, giving the space a sense of grandeur. Landon and I couldn\u2019t help but laugh when we passed the prehistoric human section. The wax figures had broad foreheads, big nostrils, and funny facial expressions as they sat frozen on a log.\n\n\u201cThat one looks like Miss Marge,\u201d Landon said, giggling and pointing at the figure that held a rock while examining it. I laughed with him as we pretended to hold spears and act like our early ancestors.\n\nWe passed a closed exhibit as we walked. The hall was dimly lit and cordoned off by velvet ropes, casting eerie shadows over several marble statues positioned throughout the space. Squinting, I thought there was the faintest flicker of movement among the statues, but the distance and darkness made it impossible to tell.\n\nAhead of me, Jenny called out to the tour guide, pointing toward the roped\u2011off area. \u201cCan we go there next?\u201d\n\nThe tour guide offered her a polite, apologetic smile. \u201cThat\u2019s actually a new exhibit still under construction. It\u2019ll be at least another month before it\u2019s ready, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n\nJenny didn\u2019t reply. Instead, her expression soured, and she stared beyond the ropes, fixated on whatever had captured her interest in the shadows.\n\nOut of all the exhibits we explored, the dinosaurs captivated me the most. Standing beneath the towering skeleton of a triceratops filled me with wonder. I vividly imagined it alive, its horns sharp and imposing. Then my imagination took another turn, picturing a fierce battle between it and a T. rex.\n\nWhile lost in my daydream, I barely noticed Landon nudging my shoulder. \u201cHey, have you seen Jenny anywhere? I haven\u2019t seen her for a little while.\u201d I snapped back to reality and took a moment to survey the area. Scanning the faces of the other students, I realized that Landon was right; Jenny was nowhere to be seen.\n\n\u201cWhere do you think she went?\u201d I asked, but Landon responded with a shrug and a mumbled, \u201cI dunno.\u201d\n\nFrustrated with the turn of events, I said, \u201cI\u2019m going to go find her before the teacher notices. I don\u2019t want us to get in trouble because we lost her; you just wait here.\u201d With that, I slipped away from the rest of the class and went farther into the museum. I passed paintings, old artifacts, maps, and more, but there was no sight of her. Growing concerned, I broke into a brisk jog, leaving little clacks on the floor as I went.\n\nI slowed when I reached the closed sculpture gallery. I glanced over the sign propped near the front entrance that detailed how the gallery came to be. Many of these statues had recently been unearthed within a Pompeii dig site, which left me remembering the stories our history teacher told us. Men, women, children, and pets had been suffocated under the ash of a volcano that not even their gods could stop. The history made my heart ache and my stomach twist.\n\n\u00a0Past the sign, a biting cold blew from the darkness emanating from the area, making me want to continue my search somewhere else. However, looking into the dark, I saw Jenny walking through the exhibit and disappearing past my view. A feeling of responsibility drove me to continue.\n\nI gripped the straps of my backpack and pretended to be like Spider-Man as I crawled into the closed\u2011off area. The smell of cleaning products lingered in the air, but it couldn\u2019t mask the hints of old stone dust. Walking through the darkness, I was distracted by what I saw.\n\nDetailed busts and complete statues made from marble surrounded me from every angle. Some of them were clearly ancient, with brown stains lining the creases of their clothes and the wrinkles of their faces. Others looked newer, as if they had either been polished or cleaned specifically for this exhibit. Yet that wasn\u2019t what scared me.\n\nEach of their expressions were filled with fear and anguish. Wide eyes, open mouths, and silent screams were expertly portrayed. If they hadn\u2019t been made out of stone, I would have expected them to blink and breathe.\n\nThe room grew darker as I walked deeper inside; my footsteps echoed against the floor throughout the quiet darkness. The statues\u2019 stares seemed to fall on me. I didn\u2019t want to spend any longer there than I had to, so I started calling out for my missing group member.\n\n\u201cJenny, where are you? We need to go back with everyone else, or we\u2019ll get in trouble.\u201d My words were met with silence. \u201cJenny, come on!\u201d. When I made my way around the corner, I was stunned by what I saw.\n\nJenny was standing in front of a sculpture carved from jet\u2011black stone. It depicted a nude man, towering at least ten feet tall, with black colored ash surrounding his feet. Rippling muscles stretched beneath his stone skin, veins snaking down his forearms like living tendrils. He looked almost alive.\n\nAs I turned my attention back to Jenny, I noticed she held a stick of chalk she must have stolen from the classroom. Without remorse, she quickly started scribbling along the black leg with the chalk, which left large white streaks. I sprinted over to her and wrestled it out of her hand before she could continue.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing? We have to clean that off!\u201d I whispered with the force of a shout as I tried to use the cloth from my shirt to wipe away the graffiti, which only spread the mark as Jenny laughed.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re so annoying it\u2019s just chalk, nobody\u2019s gonna care.\u201d I rolled my eyes and continued to clean the mess she created. As I went, I thought I saw the shadow cast from the statue move ever so slightly, but upon closer inspection, I didn\u2019t notice anything different besides a small cloud of dust falling from its hand.\n\nAfter I finished wiping away as much of the chalk I could, I turned to Jenny and grabbed her by the wrist as I pulled her away from the statues and out of the exhibit. \u201cWe need to get back to class before the teacher finds out what you did.\u201d She was quick to scratch my arm and pull away.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch me! I\u2019m not done here!\u201d She yelled as I shushed her, trying to keep the situation under control. That was until I saw the statue she had written on was staring directly at us with a feverish scowl. He looked almost alive as his curled fingers reached toward Jenny. I couldn\u2019t comprehend what I was seeing. Slowly, his hand reached further until it almost caressed her hair.\n\nWithout any control over my body, a scream tore from my throat. Instantly, the statue\u2019s head snapped toward me, its movements unnervingly fluid. Then, without a sound, it stepped back onto its podium, freezing in place once more. But its face had changed, twisted with fury, its eyes burning into mine; it knew I had seen it move. Jenny turned to look behind herself, but hadn\u2019t noticed what I saw and laughed.\n\n\u201cWhat are you yelling about, scaredy\u2011cat? Did one of the statues make you pee yourself?\u201d she taunted, but I didn\u2019t fully process what she said. I couldn\u2019t find the strength to move or speak; my eyes stayed latched to the statues. I feared if I looked away, he would move again.\n\n\u201cHey\u2026 are you OK, weirdo?\u201d Jenny continued, her tone gentle. I grabbed her by the wrist and started sprinting with her to the exit as I ignored her protests. As we ran, I looked over my shoulder, and the statue had changed position. With an almost bony finger, he pointed directly at me.\n\nBy the time we made it far enough away from the gallery, we were both out of breath, and Jenny shot me a nasty glare.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? What are you freaking out about?\u201d she spat, but I could tell my actions had scared her a little as well.\n\n\u201cThere was a statue\u2026 it tried to grab you,\u201d I said, knowing she wouldn\u2019t believe me. In response, Jenny rolled her eyes at me.\n\n\u201cStop messing with me,\u201d Jenny said, her voice wavering despite her harsh words. She crossed her arms defensively, but I noticed how her eyes kept darting back toward the gallery entrance. \u201cJust\u2026 leave me alone, loser.\u201d She started walking back toward the rest of the class, shoulders hunched. I hurried after her, heart still hammering in my chest. Despite our differences, I couldn\u2019t let myself be alone after what I had just seen.\n\nOnce we made it back to the tour, I saw Landon looking around the museum for the two of us, and once we made eye contact the furrow in his brow relaxed. Without anyone noticing, Jenny and I merged back into the group and Landon started to ask questions. \u201cWhere did she go, and why are you so red?\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t know how to respond at first. I wondered if I should tell him about the statue, but I wasn\u2019t even sure if what I saw was real or my imagination. \u201cShe was in the statue room; after I found her, we ran back to the group so we wouldn\u2019t get in trouble.\u201d Landon seemed satisfied, and we went back to listening to the tour guide, but I couldn\u2019t focus. Something was watching me.\n\nIt was instinctive; I was prey under the watchful eye of a predator. Yet no matter where I looked, I saw nothing that could be causing this reaction in me. But I could smell it. Old stone and ash assaulted my nose, pungent and sharp in the air.\n\nThe rest of the tour was uneventful, the excitement I had for the trip drained from my body and was filled with dread. The bus ride home was quiet, I barely spoke and Landon noticed. \u201cAre you ok? You look worried.\u201d\n\nI shook my head, offering a flat smile. \u201cI\u2019m ok\u2026 just tired.\u201d The conversation ended there. A few minutes passed in silence before I noticed Jenny glancing at me from across the aisle. She shifted in her seat, eyes flicking away when I caught her looking. Then, with exaggerated nonchalance, she patted the empty space beside her. Once, then twice, like she wasn\u2019t sure why she was doing it until I sat next to her.\n\n\u201cHey, you were just messing with me earlier\u2026 right?\u201d I felt bad that she was scared, but I wanted to be honest with her.\n\n\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t lying. The statue tried to grab you after you drew on it. That\u2019s why I grabbed you and ran.\u201d\n\nJenny went silent for a moment and looked out the window as she quietly spoke. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would\u2026\u201d She fell silent for a moment before continuing. \u201cI\u2019m going to punch you if you\u2019re lying\u201d She paused. \u201cBut\u2026 thanks.\u201d\n\nWhen I made it home, the sun had started to set. I walked inside and was met with the smell of dinner. My mom worked over the pot while my father cleaned the used dishes. When I walked into the kitchen, they both greeted me happily. \u201cHey bud, how was the trip?\u201d My dad asked.\n\nI tried my best to skirt around the subject. \u201cIt was good\u2026 I\u2019m exhausted, though, so I\u2019m going to go to bed.\u201d Mom\u2019s brow arched.\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you hungry, Hun? You\u2019ve been out all day.\u201d\n\nI shook my head no. \u201cI ate some snacks my friends had on the bus.\u201d This was enough for my parents to let me go to bed early. I walked quietly up the stair into my room and closed the door. I fell into my bed, and for the first time after seeing the statue, I felt safe. I cradled myself in my blankets and pillows and fell fast asleep.\n\nAs I slowly awoke, I felt that my fingers were half numb and snot ran down from my nose. My room was dark and cold, and I shivered as I sat up and wrapped myself completely in my covers. It took a few minutes to realize my window had been opened, with my curtains blowing softly in the crisp autumn air. The wind carried a faint familiar scent. The smell of ash and stone.\n\nThe cold of my room intensified ten-fold as I became suffocated by the stench. It laid thick in the air, but there was no sign of what caused it. Slowly, I stood up from my bed, still wrapped in my covers. I made my way to the window and I froze. Along the windowsill were smudges \u2014 long, pale fingerprints, smooth and ridgeless, as if carved in wax. My stomach twisted. The window was two stories off the ground.\n\nFear left my arms paralyzed at my side. My room was on the second floor of my house, far out of reach of anyone who could have wanted inside. I slammed the window shut and locked it in place while trying to slow my heart.\n\nWatching me at the edge of the forest line, fully exposed in the moonlight, stood the statue. The large chalk stain along his shin stood illuminated by the moon. In front of him was a shallow grave carved from the grass and earth.\u00a0 His face grew into a vicious smile and, ever so slowly, his hand raised higher until it pointed directly at me through the window.\n\n  \n"},"60":{"title":"The kid ate his dad\u2019s face.

A bad habit this town has with its murder-suicides.\n\nIt\u2019s not enough for somebody to shove a knife through a ribcage and suck back on a 12 gauge anymore. No, now everybody has to be original.\u00a0\n\n*Unique.*\u00a0\n\nThey\u2019ve gotta peel off their victim\u2019s face, then scarf it down like skin jerky before slashing their throats.\u00a0\n\nDo you know how long it takes to bleed out after cutting your carotid artery?\n\nNot long.\u00a0\n\nThirty seconds, maybe.\u00a0\n\nA minute if you\u2019re *really* unlucky.\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s not a lot of time to stage an arrest. To interrogate a murderer. To figure out why they killed their lover, their parents, their best friend. It\u2019s not much time to parse through the mental quagmire that compels an individual to carve off a face and swallow it whole.\u00a0\n\nIt just isn\u2019t.\u00a0\n\nSo I\u2019ve had to make do.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ve spent the last month digging through old case files and buried corpses. I\u2019ve studied the local folklore and researched nearby legends. I\u2019ve run a social media scan for sightings of anything supernatural, eerie, or otherwise batshit insane within a thirty mile radius \u2014 all to figure out what might be causing these cannibal suicides.\u00a0\n\nAnd you know what I managed to find?\n\nNothing.\u00a0\n\nNadda.\u00a0\n\nZilch.\u00a0\n\n. . .\n\nUntil tonight.\u00a0\n\nSee, I\u2019ve had a breakthrough \u2014 and it even has a name:\u00a0\n\n*Jonah*.\u00a0\n\nSeventeen years old. Bright. Studious.\u00a0\n\nCaptain of the football team. Head of the debate club. Chair of the student council for human rights and class valedictorian. Not just a good kid, but the kind that universities fight over.\n\nFour days ago, he murdered his father.\n\nTore off the man\u2019s face and chased it down with a glass of ginger ale, then cut his own throat and dropped dead beside him.\n\nOr at least, that was the plan.\u00a0\n\nUnfortunately, as fantastic as Jonah was at everything else in life, he wasn\u2019t much when it came to suicide.\u00a0\n\nLacked follow-through, you might say.\u00a0\n\nThe kid didn\u2019t sever his jugular so much as dramatically nick it. Deep enough to pass out from blood loss, but shallow enough that the paramedics were able to salvage his life.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAnd that was a mistake.\u00a0\n\nBecause now he\u2019s all mine.\u00a0\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI\u2019ve never cared much for hospitals.\n\nIt\u2019s a combination of the sterile fluorescents and the way the air smells like chemical warfare, the way everywhere you look it\u2019s either more clutter or abject emptiness.\u00a0\n\nMaybe that\u2019s why Jonah looks so unnerved when he sees me.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s my expression.\u00a0\n\nBitter. Repulsed.\u00a0\n\nBut it's hard not to feel this way. Hospitals make me think of my sister, and my sister makes me think of\u2014\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Jonah croaks.\n\nHis voice sounds like he spent the evening gargling razor blades. He's lying in the bed like a mummy, bandages strangling his throat.\u00a0\n\nI close the door behind me. Lock it.\u00a0\n\nHe asks the question again. It sounds even more painful the second time around.\n\nI still don\u2019t answer.\n\nWe haven\u2019t reached that stage in our relationship yet.\u00a0\n\nInstead, I cross the room, unbutton my jacket, and drape it over the chair by his bed. Then I take a seat. All the while, he's staring at me like I\u2019m a hallucination, like nothing about me makes sense.\u00a0\n\nUnderstandable.\n\nFrom Jonah's perspective, it's ten in the evening. A stranger just walked into his hospital room wearing a black suit and a scowl, carrying the kind of briefcase that screams bad news.\u00a0\n\nHe probably thinks I\u2019m here to audit his health insurance.\u00a0\n\nThat, or snatch his kidneys.\u00a0\n\nBut I\u2019ve got worse things on my mind.\u00a0\n\nI open my briefcase, shuffle through a handful of documents before finding my clipboard. The form attached is a standard 34-3A Interrogation Report. Useful when determining an individual\u2019s involvement in supernatural violence.\u00a0\n\nMy pen clicks. Scribbles Jonah\u2019s name up top.\u00a0\n\nHe tries to speak again. Only manages to wheeze.\n\nMy pen keeps scratching. I note the size of his pupils, his tangled brown hair, the way the corner of his mouth twitches in tune with his mounting dread. Then I fill in a dozen other fields: boiler-plate bullshit that\u2019s too dull to describe.\n\nAge. \n\nLocation. \n\n\u201cAre you with\u2014\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\nJonah winces. It probably feels like throwing up asphalt every time he speaks.\u00a0\n\nHe pushes through anyway.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAre you\u2026with the police?\u201d\n\nI pause, look up from my report and meet his eyes. Just to let him know I see him. To let him know I hear him.\u00a0\n\nThen I go back to the clipboard.\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s the secret nobody tells you about conversations: it\u2019s not about what you say, but what you don\u2019t. The only thing more agonizing than being spoken to is being ignored.\u00a0\n\nAnd right on schedule, Jonah starts to break.\u00a0\n\nHe lurches up in his bed, stiff and sore. Confused. Hits the call button for his nurse. Once. Twice. Then he starts hammering it; only nobody is coming because I\u2019m good at my job.\u00a0\n\nLike I said, Jonah\u2019s all mine.\u00a0\n\nHe tries to shout, but it\u2019s so weak, so hoarse. Barely a rasp. \u201cNurse! Hello?\u201d\n\nThe boy genius finally realized I\u2019m not supposed to be here.\n\nGood for him.\u00a0\n\nI scratch out the last of his tombstone data, then clear my throat.\u00a0\n\nHis gaze swivels to me. \u201cThe nurse\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn't coming,\u201d I tell him, clicking my pen and sliding it into my shirt. \u201cShe went home early, so did security. It\u2019s just you and me tonight.\u201d\n\nJonah\u2019s eyes are buzzing, his mind blue-screening as he tries to calculate just who I am and what I\u2019m doing here. \u201cI already told the detectives everything I know,\" he says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m aware. I\u2019m here to ask you some questions of my own.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy? Who are you exactly?\u201d\n\nI loosen the tie around my collar. \u201cSuffice it to say that I work for an organization that\u2019s taken an interest in your... situation. It\u2019s a private enterprise. Off the books. We call ourselves the Order of Alice.\u201d\n\nHe gives me a blank stare. \"I've never heard of it.\"\n\n\"That's the idea.\"\n\n\u201cSo then you\u2019re *not* a cop?\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe way he says the words is like he wants to believe them but can\u2019t.\u00a0\n\nI lean forward, cutting my voice to a whisper. \u201cNo, kid. I'm an Inquisitor. The guy you call when the monster under your bed needs to be *euthanized*.\u201d\n\nJonah\u2019s heart monitor slows.\u00a0\n\nI just told the kid that monsters are real; that our whole reality is a carefully constructed sham, and instead of panicking, he\u2019s breathing a sigh of relief.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019d call that unusual.\u00a0\n\nA cough rattles from my throat. Wet. Nasty. The kind that sounds like I'm not just spitting up phlegm, but years of my life.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI could only be so lucky.\n\n\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d Jonah asks, watching me fish in my jacket.\u00a0\n\nI pull out a pack of cigarettes. Slip one between my lips. \u201cMedicine.\u201d\n\nFor a second, the kid looks like he might tell me you can't smoke in here, like he might try his hand at a lecture. Then he spots the gun at my hip and thinks better of it.\n\nLike I said, a smart cookie.\n\n\u201cYou told the cops that you didn\u2019t murder your father,\u201d I mumble, lighting the cigarette. \u201cYou said it was someone else\u2014some*thing* else. Correct?\"\n\nHe nods, or as close as he can manage with all the gauze around his neck. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re here\u2026 You actually believe me?\u201d\u00a0\n\nHis voice is two parts hopeful, one part desperate. It probably doesn't feel great to have your whole community think you murdered your father and ate his face.\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI believe you.\u201d\n\nHe falls back on his pillows, relieved. \u201cThank god. Nobody else does. The way the detectives were talking sounded like they were angling for first-degree murder. Life in prison sorta thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cRelax. You\u2019re not going to prison.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think they\u2019ll acquit me?\u201d\n\nI laugh.\u00a0\n\nNot on purpose\u2014scout\u2019s honor. It\u2019s just that I can\u2019t help myself.\n\n\u201cHell no. If this state had the death penalty, you\u2019d skip the line three times over.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAnother drag.\u00a0\n\nAnother stormcloud.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThen why did you just tell me that\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t end up in prison because by the end of tonight, you won't exist.\u201d\n\nThe implication hangs in the air like a guillotine.\u00a0\n\nThe kid shrinks. His arms wrap around himself, protective, horrified. He probably thinks I'm talking about the monster coming for reprisals. He'd be half right.\n\n\u201cYou're innocent,\u201d I tell him. \u201cSame as all the other murder-suicides. Like you, they were victims: just an audience to their nightmares, no different than my sister.\u201d\n\nHe blinks.\n\nChrist.\n\nThere goes my motormouth.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to your sister?\u201d he asks.\u00a0\n\n\u201cSame thing that happened to you, only she didn\u2019t botch the suicide.\u201d\n\nI heave a sigh, ashing my cigarette onto the floor. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m so interested in your case, I guess. I\u2019d like to know the name of the monster that did this to you\u2014that did this to *her*.\u201d\n\nHis eyes unfocus with the sort of detached dread that makes the thousand-yard stare look nearsighted. \u201cI'm sorry,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 I can't tell you its name.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure you can.\u201d\n\nHe shakes his head. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand. All of this started the second I learned that thing\u2019s name. If I speak it. If you hear it, then\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll come for me next.\u201d\n\nI lean forward to look him in the eyes.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI'm counting on it.\u201d\n\nHe recoils, a quiet horror about him. \u201cYou make it sound like you *want* to die.\u201d\n\n\"Maybe I do.\"\n\nI crush the smoke on the armrest. Hack another cough. This one's got a bit of blood with the phlegm.\n\nLovely.\n\n\"Or maybe I don\u2019t get a say in the matter.\"\n\n\u201cIs it\u2026?\u201d\n\n\"Leukemia,\u201d I tell him. \u201cStage 4. Doc figures I\u2019ve got another year in me, assuming I kick the habit. A few months if I don\u2019t. You can do the math on that yourself.\u201d\n\nHis gaze turns downward. \u201cMy mother died of leukemia. It's an awful disease.\u201d\n\nIt is, but when it nets me this kind of emotional buy-in, it's at least useful.\u00a0\n\nI glance at the clock on the wall. It's 10:35 PM.\n\nThat means it's time to pick up the pace.\u00a0\n\n\u201cListen, I\u2019m not looking for sympathy, kid. I\u2019m telling you I know the stakes. I\u2019m dead whether I like it or not, so there\u2019s nothing you\u2019re protecting me from.\u201d\n\nJonah shifts in his blankets, like there's something eating him inside. \u201cIt's not just about protecting you,\u201d he sputters. \u201cThis thing doesn\u2019t just make you kill yourself. It makes you kill\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI already know that. What I need from you is its *name*.\u201d\n\nHe sucks back a breath, grimacing. He's having a crisis of conscience, battling his morals. He doesn\u2019t think I know what I\u2019m getting into, that he can save me some suffering if only he keeps his big mouth shut.\u00a0\n\nBut I don\u2019t have time for heroics.\u00a0\n\n\u201cJonah. You have the chance to save *lives* here. To prove your *innocence*. Right now, your father died for nothing. Tell me that name, and I can make his death count for something.\u201d\n\nAnd there it is, the final twist of the knife.\n\nLike most young men, Jonah can\u2019t help but want to do good by his father, to chase that validation even while daddy's buried six feet in the dirt.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHis eyes find mine. Haunted. Hollow. \"Okay,\u201d he says.\u00a0\n\nThen his lips start to move, and each syllable sounds sweeter than the last.\n\nHe gives me what I\u2019ve been searching for. The monster that destroyed my family, that stole my sister.\u00a0\n\nHe gives me the key to unlock the gates of hell, and it\u2019s called:\n\n**\u201cZipperjaw.\u201d**\n\nI scratch it down on my clipboard in haphazard scrawl, and sure enough, the name vanishes as soon as the ink forms. That\u2019s a bullseye. A bingo.\u00a0\n\nI smile like a maniac.\n\nCan\u2019t help it.\u00a0\n\nThirty years. That\u2019s how long I\u2019ve been searching for my sister\u2019s reaper. It\u2019s what led me to join up with the Order of Alice in the first place, but after so many dead ends, I\u2019d all but given up hope.\n\nBut now that I've got one foot in the grave, It's finally shown itself.\u00a0\n\nHere of all places.\n\nIt\u2019s almost like it lured me, pulled me back for one last dance before I closed my book for good.\u00a0\n\nMy hand, my whole arm, is shaking. Tremoring.\n\nI\u2019m *afraid.*\n\nHow long has it been since the last time I was truly, honestly *afraid*?\n\n\u201cOh god,\u201d Jonah mutters, burying his face in his hands. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done that.\"\n\nI glance up, my smile fracturing.\u00a0\n\n\"You seem like a good person,\u201d he says, his voice breaking. \u201cI really shouldn't have done that.\u201d\n\nThe kid\u2019s really gonna turn on the waterworks and ruin the moment here?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI already told you, I\u2019m a dead man walking regardless.\u201d\n\nBut Jonah lowers his hands, takes an ugly breath. \u201cYou don\u2019t get it,\u201d he says weakly. \u201cOnce you know its name, Zipperjaw doesn\u2019t just *kill* you. It finds the person you care most about and forces you to slaughter them. Just like\u2026 Just like\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIt made you kill your father.\u201d\n\nHe looks up at me. Nods. The look in his eyes is so honest-to-god guilty.\u00a0\n\nHe feels awful.\u00a0\n\nTerrible.\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s probably imagining my kids dying, or my parents, or grandparents, or a childhood friend. He\u2019s probably imagining Zipperjaw forcing me to kill some innocent bystander, just like it forced him to kill his old man, and it\u2019s tearing him up inside.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a monster,\u201d he whimpers, gripping a fistful of his hair.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re a good kid. If there's a monster here, Jonah, it's me.\u201d\n\nHe blinks through a sheet of tears. He doesn\u2019t understand. Not yet.\n\nBut he will.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI'm\u2026 a difficult person,\u201d I tell him. \u201cAnger. Bitter. Most women are smart enough to avoid me, which means I haven\u2019t got any kids. No spouse. My parents were abusive enough that if my sister hadn\u2019t beaten me to the punch, I\u2019d have probably killed them myself.\u201d\n\nJonah's eyes soften, guilt fading into sympathy and horror.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI know, I know. I\u2019m trauma dumping. I\u2019ve never really figured out the trick to following social norms\u2014to understanding conversational boundaries.\u201d\u00a0\n\nI gnaw my lip, fingers dancing on the armrest.\u00a0\n\n\u201cMy therapist calls it sociopathy. Or maybe it was psychopathy? It\u2019s hard to remember. Haven\u2019t got the DSM handy to compare.\u201d\n\nJonah\u2019s eyes start to narrow. Piece by piece, the puzzle is forming in his mind.\n\n\u201cThe point I\u2019m trying to make is that I don\u2019t have attachments to things. Not in the way you do. The closest I come to feeling a sense of connection is probably through my work.\u201d\u00a0\n\nI chuckle, shaking my head. \u201cYou might say I\u2019m married to my job.\u201d\n\nJonah swallows. \u201cWhat are you trying to say?\"\n\n\u201cZipperjaw killed my sister,\u201d I tell him, an absent smile carving a path across my face. \u201cThe only person I ever truly cared about. And now? There\u2019s nothing I cherish more than the thought of ripping it to pieces\u2014and the only way I get to do that is through you, Jonah.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat means I need your story. It means I need to know what happened the night you ate your father\u2019s face. I need all of it\u2014every last detail.\u201d\n\nThe heart monitor starts to scream.\u00a0\n\nJonah tries to lurch from his bed, but I shoot from my seat. Shove him back down.\u00a0\n\n\u201cLet me go!\u201d he rasps. \u201cGet off!\u201d\n\nLike I said, a smart cookie.\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s finally pieced it together, recognizing the nightmare unfolding before him. Only I can\u2019t risk any miscommunication. Not while midnight is just an hour away \u2014 and Zipperjaw with it.\u00a0\n\nI press my finger against his jugular. Not hard. Just hard enough that he stops fighting and starts cooperating.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou get it now, don't you?\u201d\n\nHe's shaking like cornered livestock. His eyes dart to the clock on the wall: 11:12 PM.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt's you,\u201d I say quietly, inches from his ear. \u201cRight now, nobody in the entire world is more important to me than you are, Jonah.\u201d\n\nHe tenses. It\u2019s all crashing down on him now \u2014 the horror of what he\u2019s done \u2014 of what I\u2019ve done *to* him.\u00a0\n\nIt wasn\u2019t personal.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s just that I need him motivated. Focused. I need a surefire way to push him past his trauma and get to the core of his experience. That means he has to have some skin in the game.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou asshole,\u201d he spits, voice dripping with betrayal. \u201cYou *used* me.\u201d\n\nI reach for my clipboard, slip my pen from my pocket.\n\n\u201cDidn't have much choice\u2014people are dying in this town. They're killing their loved ones. Carving off faces. Just the same way my sister did. And I have to know why, Jonah. I have to know why Zipperjaw does these awful things.\u201d\n\nHe recoils, disgusted. \u201cYou actually think your sister would be okay with this?

As I lay snug and warm, she would regale me with tales of spirits who wander the forests of Bar Island. There were small ones which she called \"Fork Flyers\", and larger ones known as the \"Sledgestones\", but the biggest of them all was Yorut. He was a massive turtle with a head and face like that of a snail. Seven large horns formed a mane around his neck, preventing him from ever withdrawing into his shell. My mother would tell me that this is what led him to become the protector of the other spirits. Because Yorut could never withdraw, his only option when threatened was to fight to the end. She would weave fantastical tales of the twenty foot tall beast batting away bulldozers, and leering at corporate lawyers in a threatening manner.  I had figured out by the age of 12 that most of my mother's stories were just that, stories. She had spent her college years among the environmentalists, and that was very much reflected in the tall tales she created. I guess I had inherited a bit of that drive from her, as I elected to join the Forestry Service. It was during my career there that I learned that Yorut was very real.\n\n\nTuesday, February 9th, 1994 \n\n\nIt started as a day like any other, and quickly took a turn for the bizarre. I stopped in at Henry's coffee shop as I did every morning. Henry and I exchanged our usual pleasantries and he set right to work preparing my drink. By the time he turned back around to hand it to me there had been a dramatic shift in demeanor. Henry had always been amicable, even friendly, but this was different. His eyes were as wide as dinner plates. His usually charming smile was just a bit more rigid than usual. It looked as if making my coffee had electrified Henry with happiness. \n\n\n\"Uh, hey man are you okay?\" I asked\n\n\"Oh you betcha, I just feel so good all of a sudden it's impossible not to smile.\" Henry replied, beginning to rub his own face as if his skin were velvet. \n\n\"Well let's hope you put some of that sunshine into my drink\" I laughed and asked Henry how much I owed him. \n\n\"It's on the house!\" Henry shouted, before adding \"IN FACT, FREE COFFEE FOR EVERYONE\" \n\n\nHenry's grand showing of goodwill had brought light into the hearts of everybody there. It's amazing sometimes how something so small can make people so happy. I was even more amazed to see the ripple effect it had caused. As I drove out of the town on my way to work, I passed John's used car lot where he was putting up crudely made cardboard signs which read \"Zero money down? Zero money EVER!\" People were filing out of the local Walmart with cart after cart full of unpurchased goods. Everybody involved, be they customer or staff, was grinning from ear to ear. I heard people on the streets shouting greetings to one another. I watched the town mayor, Jonah Newport, climb into a car with a perfect stranger just because he had asked. For all intents and purposes it appeared to be a new revolution of love and brotherhood unfolding before my eyes. The reality of the situation was much more... complex. \n\n\nAfter the chaotic charity and fraternity of the morning I was excited to get out into the forest and enjoy the stillness of nature. I spent most of the day walking the trails checking for litter and signs of wildlife. By the time I had nearly finished my rounds the sun had begun to sink in the western sky. If it weren't for the encroaching darkness of the evening I may never have seen the streaks of glowing purple light darting around the trees. As I approached the area where I had seen them, I began to hear noises. Wet, popping thumps followed by small screeches. The sound of rock striking against rock, each time accompanied by a breathy \"kuh\". Another twenty feet and I could see the purple streaks a little bit better. Leathery wings held their slight frames aloft, bodies no more than two inches across at their widest, with long drifting tails which ended in a two-pronged pitchfork. My eyes widened as the implications of what I was seeing began to dawn on me. \"Flying Forks\" I thought \"no, wait. It was 'Fork Flyers'.\" \n\n\nCreatures straight from my bedtime stories now danced before me, each taking its place in a great ring which made its orbit around some unseen object. I was rooted in place as I watched their silent parade. I noticed after a time that not all of the Fork Flyers were glowing with that unearthly shade of purple. The ones who had lost their shine peeled off from the rest and flew inward. In the stories my mother had told me, Fork Flyers were never mean, unless they were hungry. That little tidbit is what drove me to make the unfathomably stupid decision to try and slip past the ring. I waited, taking care to identify a portion of the ring where the Flyers glowed brightest. I surmised that the brightest of them might have been the most satiated, so I counted the seconds it took for my group to come around, and when it did I ran like hell. \n\n\nDiving under the ring of Flyers I scrambled to my feet and ran for cover as fast as I could. The foolishness of my decision loomed over me, growing in size with each passing second, until I had made it far enough to feel safe hiding once more. I moved between the trees, ears alert for any sign of hungry Forks flying my way. When I finally saw him I was stunned. It was Yorut. He was everything the stories said he was. Easily 40 feet from head to tail. His seven horns protruded high into the sky. Each leg a mighty trunk like that of a Redwood. He was magnificent. He was awe-inspiring, and he was dead. The Fork Flyers covered every inch of exposed flesh. Hundreds upon hundreds of pitchforks stabbing into Yorut's increasingly mangled body. More stood in wait, perched along each of the seven horns which crowned his head. As they fed, the tails of the flyers began pulsing with a faint light which suffused their bodies. My earlier suspicions were confirmed when a flyer, the most luminous of his cohort, flew away to rejoin the great ring. \n\n\nI could see groups of blue humanoid figures sitting in tightly knit circles. Each one had a large, rough patch on their forehead. They took turns bashing these patches against Yorut's shell, attempting to break it open. When their efforts were successful the peaceful, cooperative circles turned into violent feeding frenzies. Elbows flew with wild abandon as each of the Sledgestones fought to rip away chunks of the Grand turtle's flesh. Unlike the Fork Flyers, the Sledgestones did not seem to ever reach satiety. \n\n\nI was so engrossed in watching the beasts of my imagination devouring the hero of all my favorite stories that I had failed to hear the sound of leathery wings slipping through the night air. The Fork Flyer must have been making its way to Yorut when it spotted me and decided I might be easy prey. As it approached me the Flyer's tail stretched impossibly far, impossibly fast. The twin prongs of its tail planted themselves on both sides of my neck, narrowly missing a fatal blow. The prongs atop its head were the next to come. Another miss, with the creature's vicious face held mere inches away from me by its own tools. Teeth lined its oval mouth, gnashing and screeching in its struggle to reach me. I would love to say I took action.  That I dislodged the creature's tail to make my escape, but I didn't. I didn't even scream. I just stared at the Flyer as it snapped and screeched at me, knowing I was trapped. \n\n\nA streak of blue obliterated the winged devil before colliding with a tree in its path. The Flyer had been destroyed, but the tail remained lodged in the tree holding me still. Its severed head continued to gnaw uselessly at the distance between us. A Sledgestone, late to the party, had arrived just in time to save my life. It got up, shaking the concussion out of its head, and locked its eyes on mine. The blue giant was easily 9 feet tall. It was covered in hair, like the fur of an animal, and it was beginning its charge. I moved as much as I could manage, only just avoiding my right leg being turned to paste. The vibrations from the impact loosened the Flyer's abandoned extremities. I pushed with all the strength of desperation and I was made free, but not yet safe. The Sledgestone was recovering quickly. I ran like hell through the forest, all the while made aware of my pursuer by the thunderous slam of its skull against tree after tree. I drove straight home and didn't come out of my bedroom for two days. \n\n\nTuesday February 10th\n\n\nI had thought that isolation would be good. That it would help me sort out my thoughts, but in reality I was only spinning in circles. I had a long list of questions to answer and I had gotten stumped by the very first: How was any of this real? These were supposed to be nothing more than legends that teach kids lessons. Like the legend of Yehankaru, a shapeshifter who would lurk in the shadows of prosperous civilizations, stealing away anyone who allowed it to lure them to a secluded area. Easily the most heavy-handed metaphor for \"stranger danger\" I had ever seen. \n\n\nWednesday, February 11th\n\n\nI made my way into town for a coffee and a bit of normalcy. As he made my drink for me, I noticed that Henry's lunatic grin now needed to be frequently reapplied. Whatever ecstasy had overcome the town seemed to be fading. The signs at John's now half-empty car lot had been changed to say \"TWO DOLLARS DOWN?! Get outta town!\" The employees of the depleted Walmart shrugged at customers perusing barren shelves. The same vehicle that had picked up the mayor was now offering Harvey Potler a steak dinner if he got in the car. Harvey accepted the offer in the end. On the surface it was all still friendly, but the cracks were beginning to show. \n\n\nI arrived at the Ranger's station to find my superior, Terrence Howard (not that one), with his head in his hands. People had been going missing along trails in record numbers, and not just near our station. All across the island, men and women were failing to return from things as mundane as trips to the grocery store. I tried to tell him what I had seen in the woods, but I couldn't find the words. In the end, I only irritated him further with my stammering.\n\n\n\"Damn it, Brantley, either spit it out or get the hell out of my office. I don't have time to play charades when half the fucking town is missing.\" He glared at me as he spat out the words. I couldn't find a way to explain without landing myself in a straitjacket. I thought maybe it would be easier if I showed him. \n\n\"Will you come with me?\" I asked timidly, \"I can't find the words.\" \n\nTerrence Howard's expression softened. Terrence was a good man, albeit a good man under an extreme amount of stress. He sighed. \"Fine,\" He said \"but we need to be back before noon.\" \n\n\nWe stared at the churning festival of consumption for what felt like days. The Flyers continued their skewering of the great beast. Sledgestones crowded in larger groups as the available real estate on Yorut's back dwindled. New species of creature had turned up to the feast. A face set in a flat area about the size of a beach ball with five appendages reaching toward the sky. They resembled human hands sprouting from the ground. Using their \"fingers\" to climb, they made their way to one of the Sledgestones' abandoned portholes before setting their rat-like faces down in the entryway. Wolves the size of moose stalked around the corpse, slipping in to tear away chunks of destroyed flesh before retreating to their pack. Their jet black fur danced with greens and blues as they ran. It was one forty five when Terrence turned to me and asked the question that had been burning in my mind since I found Yorut. \n\n\n \"What the fuck?\" \n\n\"...Yeah...\" was all I could offer. \n\n\"Why didn't you say anything when you found it?\" Terrence asked. \n\n\"Respectfully, sir, I had no idea how to explain this.\" I replied. \n\n\"That's...fair...\" he said. \"What the hell are we supposed to do about this, Brantley?\" \n\n\nI was relieved beyond measure to hear that. \"We.\" If I were going to be grappling with the impossible, at least I wouldn't be doing it alone. Easy come easy go, I guess. \n\n\nWe were halfway back to the station, walking together in stunned silence, when we first saw them. Dark shadows in the depths of the forest. Terrence must have noticed them first. He spoke quietly. \n\n\"Keep your eyes trained forward and do not slow down. I don't know what they'll do if they know that we're aware of them. It's just a quarter mile to the station now.\" \n\n\nThe small sign signifying the first set of guest restrooms verified his words. I did as I was told. Never letting my attention wander too close to the many lights of unblinking eyes. Through my peripherals I could see that not every figure was whole. Some only had a single glowing ember set deep into the skull. Others had tiny twin stars blazing in their ocular cavities. The figures were of different sizes. Some big, some small. Some thin, some more rotund. Their unified gaze followed us all the while. Quiet. Patient. Hunters waiting for a chance to strike. \n\n\nWe reached the station after fifteen minutes which each felt like seven. The feeling of elation from safely completing our journey hit me like a truck. I felt that as long as we could reach the station, everything would be alright. It wasn't until we had shut the door behind us that I remembered what we were doing. Noting had changed. We had made no progress. We were only seeking a shelter from which to wonder about what the hell was happening. We were every bit as lost as when we had set out. We sat together in total silence for an hour or two. \n\n\"My mother used to tell me about these things.\" I said. \"In stories when I was a kid. I never thought any of it was real. Half of the time she would make Yorut, that's the dead guy, into a pseudo-Captain Planet figure.\" I continued, \"the ones with points at each end are called Fork Flyers. She called the blue ones 'Sledgestones'. She never mentioned the wolves or the hands.\" \n\n\"Perhaps it's related to some old folklore. Your mother had to get these stories from somewhere, right?\" Terrence Howard posited. \n\nI had been thinking much the same. I was ready to look up information on the town's legends when Terrence told me there was no need. \n\n\"I keep a book of old tales in my truck.\" And his face fell as if he were ashamed to say, \"I...I use the stories to scare hikers sometimes.\" \n\n\nI laughed at the admission, as Terrence walked outside to retrieve the book. The mistake was revealed to me immediately. Terrence had been gone for just under a minute when the silence of the night was suddenly broke by the sound of a hundred footfalls. In the middle of the cacophony I could hear a single voice crying out. \n\n\n\"Waitwaitwait NO. Brantley! Help...help...help\" the voice of my only companion in this crisis faded meekly into the distance, drowned out by the whooping cries of his captors. \n\n\nThursday, February 12th \n\n\nI filed a missing persons report. The clerk told me that Terrence would mark the 237th person to disappear. She informed me of this with an air that said \"don't get your hopes up\". I should have taken that bit of unspoken advice. \n\n\nThe air in Henry's coffee shop seemed different today. He, along with his customers, had all adopted a slight scowl. The overall mood felt...melancholic. Henry grumbled at my coffee as he poured it, and gave it to me with his other hand outstretched. \n\n\n\"What, no more free coffee?\" I asked, unserious. \n\n\"PLEASE. Just stop. I'm not in the mood for this kind of crap today.\" He bristled all over as I noticed the empty glass cases which usually held a variety of food items. \"The city says I didn't have the proper permits for giving away coffee. If you ask me, they've got it out for me.\" \n\n\"Oh geez, I'm sorry to hear that.\" I replied. I meant it, Henry had always been kind. The town had come to view him as a staple. After all, what is the linchpin of society if not the local coffee shop? I put a five dollar bill in the tip jar and went on my way. \n\nJohn's signs had changed once again. This time, they read: \"I like money too, yknow!\" I could see John through the window to his office. He seemed to be hard at work crafting tomorrow's message. Elizabeth Stoltz, an older woman with a fiery temper, was in a one-sided shouting match with the vehicle which had been collecting townsfolk. \n\n\"How dare you proposition me, sir? I am a lady. I will not be getting into a car full of strange me-\" her sentence cut off as a wiry arm reached out in a flash and dragged her into the vehicle through the window. I tried to catch the car's license plate number, but the letters appeared to be shifting constantly. If anybody else on the street had noticed, they didn't give any indication. I decided I would go and try to retrieve the book Terrence had mentioned. The journey was largely uneventful. Once or twice during the drive I caught sight of people hiding (poorly) behind trees. You know that thing kids do where they hide behind something that barely obscures your vision of them? It was like that. \n\n\nThe book was not worth the uneventful drive. Aside from a passing mention of Yorut, I found absolutely nothing. No Fork Flyers, no Sledgestones, nada. If my mother were still with us I could ask her directly where her old stories came from. In that moment, I missed her more than usual. I sat back, drinking in the silence of the Ranger's station, thinking of the woman who had raised me. \n\n\nBereft of answers. Still. I found myself curious about the state of Yorut. After what had happened to Terrence, I was taking no chances. I fired up the drone we use to scout for missing hikers and sent it on its way. \n\n\nShards of shell littered the clearing. Every inch of ground not covered by the fragments lay soaked in a viscous purple fluid. The Fork Flyers had disappeared from the immediate area,  seemingly all moving to the great ring which still made its orbit around the corpse of Yorut. The Sledgestones were standing in a massive huddle, desperately beating back the titanic wolves which had appeared. The hands had grown additional appendages which slithered their way across the bloodied ground looking to grab up anything it found. One of the hands, which had used its newfound tentacle to snatch up a Sledgestone, was pierced from within by a coalition of crimson worms. Their slender bodies tapered into points that looked sharp enough to pierce Kevlar. I turned the drone around to bring it home, only for it to be chased down and knocked out of the sky by a curious Fork. \n\n\nIt seemed to me that the feast was reaching its end. There wasn't enough of Yorut left to sustain the creatures, and they had begun to turn on one another. Perhaps this problem would solve itself. If I could just wait a few days, the corpse would be fully depleted and all this craziness might finally end. \n\nSo of course, shit hit the fan the next day. \n\n\nFriday, February 13th \n\n\nBedlam had come to town. Henry stood outside of his coffee shop yelling at passersby. \n\n\n\"MY BUSINESS IS FAILING BECAUSE YOU GREEDY FUCKS DON'T PAY FOR YOUR COFFEE\" he raged, stopping himself for a moment to say hello to me, before launching further into his tirade. I stopped in at the police station to check for any sign of Terrence, and I found more than I had bargained for. Two hundred and fifty missing persons had all shown up to the station that morning, and among them were Harvey Potler, and Terrence. I was elated. \n\n\"TERRENCE\" I shouted, causing him to stumble slightly in surprise. \"I'm so glad you're okay, what the hell happened?\"\n\n\n\"Huh?\" Was his initial reply, hastily adding \"Oh, that. Yeah I got loose about an hour after they took me. Ran all night. Thank goodness I found a trail. I could have died out there, Brantley.\" \n\n\n\"Dude, I know!\" I finally took a good look at him. Terrence looked like shit. His clothes hung loosely off his body. Occasionally a rib would show through the shirt as he moved. He was emaciated, as if he had been starving for days when no more than 36 hours had passed. In fact, all of the returning vanished looked brutally thin. I brushed it off, making a mental note to get this man a cheeseburger ASAP. \n\n\nAs we drove aimlessly through town, the relationship between Terrence and I was flipped on its head. Usually I'm the one making impractical suggestions to irritate Terrence. Today, apparently, it was his turn. \n\n\n\"Maybe we should go scope out the corpse again\" he said. \n\n\n\"I don't see much point in that.\" I replied. The scene had remained, at its core, largely the same since I had discovered it. With the feast tapering off, I didn't know what information we could possibly glean from another look. Terrence, to his credit, dropped that particular suggestion. However, it was immediately followed up with another. \n\n\n\"Well, there's all these old sewer tunnels. Maybe there's something to investigate down there.\" He sounded desperate. I understood exactly how that felt. I just wanted an answer. I would have gone down into those sewers, had I seen anything at all to suggest they held clues for us. \n\n\n\"The sewers? Are you feeling okay, man?\" I was worried about my friend\/boss. He had been abducted by creatures of the forest. Who knows what that's like, other than him? I could forgive him for being in a bit of a fog. \n\n\n\"Yeah, I'm totally fine I just think we should go somewhere that nobody else goes. If there was something to see where people go, then somebody would have seen it. We should be checking the areas where there are no other peo-\" his words were cut off by the shattering of the passenger side rear window. John stood at the edge of his empty lot, shotgun in hand. He had a look on his face of bewildered animalistic rage. He racked another shell and took aim once more. The pellets punched dozens of tiny holes in the passenger side door. They tore around Terrence's legs, some even leaving holes in his pants. Miraculously, he was unharmed. I sped away as fast as the vehicle would allow. \n\n\nEverywhere we went, there was chaos. Walmart was completely engulfed in flames. People shouted obscenities at one another. Fights to the death were breaking out over every minor disagreement. Terrence and I had been watching Jane Turnbull giving Gabe Trund a beatdown over \"the good cart\" at Aldi. Suddenly, Terrence stiffened before saying \"too late\" and sprinting away into the streets. I gave chase, but he was impossibly fast. I didn't catch up until we had made it to the town square. What I saw there made my next decision extremely simple. \n\n\nThe formerly missing had converged on the area. They all stood around, slack jawed and staring at the clock tower in the center of town. A straggler, who I recognized to be  Jonah Newport, arrived on the scene and it was as if a switch had been flipped. Two hundred and sixty seven bodies simultaneously disrobed. Their heads sat atop bodies devoid of flesh. Held aloft and upright by nothing more than bones which had been brutally marred. Looking closely at Terrence, who was nearest to me, I could see the marks of gnawing teeth along every inch of exposed bone. The missing climbed over top of one another until they formed a massive human pyramid. Jonah Newport climbed to its apex and proceeded to dive  directly into the mouth of Lane Pommson. As Jonah made his way toward the ground, the rest of the pyramid followed suit. Those standing on the ground were flung high into the air. The pyramid stood inverted as Jonah slid into the dry earth with a squelch. The others did not follow Jonah on his subterranean journey. Instead their bodies smashed against the earth, their skeletons scattering in all directions, leaving only a pile of still animated heads surrounded by thousands upon thousands of bones. Each head was spewing a word salad the likes of which has never been seen. The cacophony of their pointless vocalizations was nearly as disturbing as what had led them there.\n\n\nThat was when I made the best decision I had made all week. I left. As my battle scarred Corolla rolled away from the town of Bar Harbor, I could just barely see a long line of purple streaks flying away from the clearing which had become Yorut's grave."},"62":{"title":"Have you heard of Gravedigger's fever?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kgobr5\/have_you_heard_of_gravediggers_fever\/","flair":null,"author":"Carnaloth","selftext":"I want to tell you a story. I really don\u2019t care if you believe me.\u00a0 I know that what I\u2019m about to say might sound frightening but please don\u2019t be frightened.\u00a0 Something wonderful has happened to me, and if you\u2019re reading this, I think it could happen to you too.\u00a0 Let me tell you about a miracle:\n\n\n\nIt was about a month ago that my grandfather passed on due to complications from his stroke late last year.\u00a0 He and I were very close and after his stroke I had taken care of my grandmother and him the best I could while still making my way through university.\u00a0 The day of the funeral service it rained like hell.\u00a0 The ground of the tiny cemetery on the corner of Elk and Monroe\u00a0turned to mush underfoot, and a few unfortunate folks got mud all over their funeral blacks.\u00a0 The service had been incredibly hard for me and because I had a lot of difficulty crying around my family and friends, I decided to stay back from the burial service so I could get a couple minutes to honestly grieve.\u00a0 That\u2019s when I saw him.\n\n\n\nThe cemetery\u2019s caretaker stood out in the pouring rain looking underdressed and soaked to the bone.\u00a0 He stood a respectful distance away from the service, clearly not wanting attention but I could tell he was shivering so I walked over with my black umbrella to give him some relief.\n\n\n\nWhen I got closer the first thing I noticed was that he was young.\u00a0 Under his thick, blond beard he couldn\u2019t have been more than a year or two older than me.\u00a0 The second thing I noticed was an odour that hung around him, thick and cool.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t a terrible smell, more that he smelled like wet, black earth (even more so than the whole world seemed to smell of it in the rain),\u00a0 and a sort of cinnamony scent I couldn\u2019t quite place.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you sir\u201d he said in a surprisingly soft voice.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that you\u2026 well you looked cold\u201d I stammered out, slightly off balance from the age, the smell, and now the voice.\u00a0 The caretaker gestured out to the mass of black umbrellas and solemn faces.\n\n\n\n\u201cWho was he to you?\u201d he asked in that soft, almost cautious voice.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy Grandfather\u2026\u00a0 I loved him dearly\u201d I said, the second half of the sentence falling lame even to my own ears.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou and all those people out there,\u201d he gestured with a long-nailed hand out to my friends and family. \u201cI\u2019ve worked this plot for a long time; seen all sorts go into the earth.\u00a0 You can always tell when it was a well-loved one.\u00a0 Something in the faces of the mourners\u2026 I can\u2019t quite explain but it\u2019s there\u201d He picked each word carefully like an artist selecting just the right brush.\u00a0 As he spoke I caught a whiff of his breath and the smell that hung around him hit me even harder, this time less pleasant and with an underlying rank sweetness.\n\n\n\n\u201cHow long have you worked here?\u201d I inquired, eager to change the subject as my roiling emotions threatened to bubble over again.\n\n\n\n\u201cA good long while now, I don\u2019t bother keeping track.\u00a0 The work\u2019s rewarding and this is a good place.\u00a0 A calm and quiet place\u2026\u201d his face spoke of a life that hadn\u2019t always been full of calm and quiet places.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t disagree with him though, despite the rain or maybe even because of it the cemetery had almost an ethereal stillness and looking over the well-cleaned headstones I could see how this place could be someone\u2019s haven if not mine. \u00a0 We made a sort of gentle conversation that slowly spun out into silence.\u00a0 Then we stood for a while, listening to the rain patter on the fabric of the umbrella we shared and watching the service from afar.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t until just before I was about to excuse myself to return to the last minutes of the service that he spoke again.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think most people would have shared their umbrella.\u201d he mused without looking away from the mourners and meeting my eyes.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d I asked, startled out of my thoughts.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re uncomfortable with people like me, people who are\u2026 proximate to death and decay.\u00a0 Thank you for being different, and thank you for the conversation.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s time you get back to your grandfather, they\u2019re about to begin the lowering.\u201d he offered one of his long-nailed hands.\u00a0 I took it with only the slightest hesitation.\u00a0 His grip was strong, painfully so.\u00a0 As he squeezed my hand he leaned in, breath stinking of the grave he said: \u201cGood deeds are rewarded my friend, run along now.\u201d. \u00a0 The biting grip disappeared as quick as it came on and I did my best to politely excuse myself without appearing shaken.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t notice until later but those long snaggled fingernails had bitten into the meat of my right hand in two places forming a shallow v-shaped cut.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nThere was a small reception after at my grandparent\u2019s house.\u00a0 We told stories about my grandfather, some of which I had never heard until then.\u00a0 It felt like once the ritual of viewing and funeral and burial were complete, my grandfather had somehow become a real person again if that makes any sense.\u00a0 I felt closer to him then than I had when I was helping to carry the casket.\u00a0 The house seemed to hold something of his presence that his cold body couldn\u2019t match.\u00a0 I never expected a funeral to have snacks but the reception had tons of food, none of which I had much of an appetite for.\n\n\n\nEventually I excused myself, I was exhausted and I had to get ready for school\u00a0 the next day.\u00a0 As I left my grandmother insisted I take some of my grandfather\u2019s brandy with me.\u00a0 She said she wouldn\u2019t drink it anyway and that brandy is good for the constitution.\u00a0 When I asked her why that was important she said with simple finality \u201cyou just look a bit pale that\u2019s all\u201d.\n\n\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nThat night I dreamed of the cemetery on the corner of Elk and Monroe.\u00a0 I dreamed of the silent headstones at night, how the place would look lit only by the streetlight spilling over the high wall that surrounded it.\u00a0 I dreamed that I was late to my grandfather\u2019s funeral, that I was dressed in my blacks and my dress shoes were getting stuck in the sucking, grasping mud and when I finally made it to the grave everybody was long gone.\u00a0 I had something that I meant to give my grandfather before he was buried, a little silver fork, and so I began to dig with my hands into the filled grave so that I could give him this one last thing and he could give me something that I wanted in return.\u00a0 As I dug into the soaked earth the smell of the grave filled my nose and my stomach bubbled and stirred uncomfortably.\u00a0 I excavated my way down, silver fork held in my teeth before my nails scratched on the lid of the coffin.\u00a0 Suddenly the flash of lamplight came over me and\u2026.\n\n\n\nI woke up in a feverish sweat,\u00a0 my mouth full of a gungey, unclean, sick taste.\u00a0 My bones ached and I knew immediately that I would not be making it to class today.\u00a0 I lay a while in my sticky-damp sheets, the dream was still pressed into the forefront of my consciousness.\u00a0 The pure illogic of it bemused me.\u00a0 My fevered brain raked over the details of the dream.\u00a0 Only as I pulled my mind away from the empty, sodden cemetery on the corner of Elk and Monroe did I realize just how hungry I was.\n\n\n\nIn all the events of yesterday I had completely forgotten to eat.\u00a0 I hadn\u2019t had any appetite at the reception and once I had got home I had been too preoccupied by my grief and preparations for school.\u00a0 When I awoke, fevered as I was, I was starving.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nI peeled myself out of my sheets and walked tenderly through my apartment.\u00a0 I filled a glass with water and sucked it down to try to soothe my aching head.\u00a0 It did no good.\u00a0 When I opened my refrigerator a pungent cacophony of odours hit me in waves.\u00a0 I slammed the fridge door shut before the smell made me sick.\u00a0 *Has something gone off in there?*\u00a0 I wondered to myself.\u00a0 The worst part was that the horrible smell hadn\u2019t allayed my hunger for more than a few seconds.\u00a0 I grabbed a piece of bread and started chewing it but the texture suddenly felt all wrong and I hadn\u2019t gotten more than bite down when I had to run to my sick to wretch.\u00a0 Bent over the sink, quivering with tremors and smelling my own thin vomit, I realized that maybe the best thing I could do for myself was to go back to bed.\n\n\n\nAfter I sent off a few short emails to my professors explaining that I was ill, I decided I would shower off the tacky sweat residue that clung to my skin.\u00a0 As I reached for my soap in the shower I noticed something strange on my hand.\u00a0 At first I thought it was an inkstain but when I inspected the v-shaped mark on the bottom of my right hand I realized that the two small cuts the caretaker\u2019s fingernails had made had scabbed over completely black.\n\n\n\nI was immediately worried that the cut had become infected or something but there was no inflammation and when I prodded it gently it didn\u2019t sting any more than your typical scab.\u00a0 After I finished my shower I opted to dab some polysporin on and around it and go back to my bed.\n\n\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nI took a long while getting back to sleep between the fever and the stomach cramping hunger but when I did my dreams were strange again.\u00a0 I dreamed of family dinners and the cemetery.\u00a0 I dreamed of the Caretaker with his shovel.\u00a0 I dreamed of him filling graves and emptying them.\u00a0 I dreamed about the sound a shovel makes when it hits the roof of a casket, like the sound of a pirate striking buried treasure.\u00a0 I dreamed of smelling that damp dirt and cinnamon smell and when I woke late in the evening my fever had grown far worse and my mouth was watering.\n\n\n\nI was getting worse.\u00a0 I was a pale and shaking mess, completely unable to keep a bite of solid food down.\u00a0 When I tried a sip of my grandfather\u2019s brandy I nearly spat it out.\u00a0 A rancid flavour had surpassed even the burn of alcohol in it.\u00a0 I resolved to drink only water until this flu or fever had passed and I shivered out the rest of the evening on my couch trying to distract myself from the viscous combination of malaise and hunger.\u00a0 I dozed intermittently but always started awake from strange dreams full of gravedirt.\n\n\n\nForty eight hours after my grandfather\u2019s funeral I decided I was going to go to the emergency room.\u00a0 The fever was bad, the hunger was worse.\u00a0 I had wondered if I was well enough to drive but ultimately decided that if this was contagious, it would be best for everyone if I tried to avoid exposing anyone.\n\n\n\nBy the time I had walked out to my car, my heart was racing with effort and a cloud of lightheadedness hung over me.\u00a0 I sat in my car for a full eight minutes before I felt clear headed enough to start it.\u00a0 Even as I started to drive, I wondered if I was making a terrible mistake in trying to drive.\u00a0 My attention kept wandering and I would lose seconds at a time, realizing I had run a yellow light or missed a turn.\u00a0 My eyes kept straying to brightly lit fast food signs but I knew as soon as the greasy paper bag was passed over to me I wouldn\u2019t be able to take a single bite.\u00a0 I rolled down my window to get some cool air on my face, that\u2019s when I realized where I was.\n\n\n\nThe smell washed over me and I felt my stomach growl maddeningly.\u00a0 It took a moment to identify.\u00a0 It was rich and cool, a simultaneously wet and dry odour.\u00a0 It was herby with an earthy note and the slightest hint of fruitiness.\u00a0 I had visions of sweet, cool fruits being pulled from rich, damp earth.\u00a0 My focus drifted in the tantalising presence of this smell until\u2026.\n\n\n\nThe squawk of a car horn behind me snapped me out of my daze.\u00a0 The light at the intersection of Elk and Siemens had changed to green and I had been idling in front of it for who knows how long.\u00a0 I goosed the gas pedal, eyes scanning for the source of the delicious smell when I saw it.\u00a0 The next intersection was Elk and Monroe.\u00a0 The cemetery gate on the corner stood wide open flanked by stone angels and as I drove towards it the sensations of smell and hunger threatened to overwhelm me matched only by my internal horror.\u00a0 How could it be?\u00a0 How could it smell so\u2026 right?\u00a0 There was nothing for me there \u2014 only the headstones, the dirt, and, deep within the earth, gently mouldering, fermenting, the many corpses with their pale flesh\u2026\n\n\n\nI pulled away from the thought like it was a fat, black spider discovered walking over my pillow. \u00a0*It was the fever, it\u2019s making me delirious,* I reasoned to myself.\u00a0 I immediately turned off the street that led to the cemetery gates and in a daze drove halfway home before I remembered I had planned to go to the hospital.\u00a0 I was so desperate to get distance away from those gates and that horrid, wonderful smell that I couldn\u2019t even bring myself to turn back.\u00a0 Fatigue was washing over me in dark waves and if not for the bone deep horror that gripped me I might have fallen asleep at the wheel.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhen I got back to my apartment I pulled into my stall at a steep angle and stumbled to the elevator, resting my burning head against the cool metal of the elevator door frame as I waited for its arrival.\u00a0 *I\u2019ll call 911 tomorrow if I\u2019m not better*, I bargained with myself.\u00a0 When I got into my apartment fever had turned to chills and I hid under the sheets, body quaking and mind reeling.\u00a0 Even as I lay there, horror mingled with wanting into a primordial stew of feeling.\u00a0 Red and black fantasies played at the edge of my brain before swallowing me whole as I drifted off to uneasy sleep.\n\n\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nIn those dreams I was a farmer in a field of dark soil and pale stones.\u00a0 I moved confidently with hoe and shovel, digging and planting deep within the earth.\u00a0 I pulled a strange and lovely crop from the ground and ate it under the stars.\u00a0 I was content.\u00a0 I basked in the night\u2019s breeze and drew in the odour of the land and my harvest mouldering below its surface and I was so at peace.\u00a0 But it was only a dream.\u00a0 I awoke.\n\n\n\nThe fever had broken; the hunger had grown.\u00a0 When my eyes snapped open in the night-black room, I knew where my medicine was.\u00a0 The world had shrunk into a single point of rough need and I rose from the chill sheets with a blank-minded purpose.\u00a0 Time slipped, I was in the car.\u00a0 The blue dashboard clock read 2:55.\u00a0 I watched the streetlamps float past my car and I rolled down my windows.\u00a0 I breathed deeply of the night air and I caught the faintest hint of it on the wind.\u00a0 Time slipped, the car had stopped. I had pulled into the parking lot.\u00a0 Behind me the intersection lights cast a pale green hue over the scene.\u00a0 The smell was so thick you could cut it with a knife.\u00a0 The stone angels seemed to beckon me in with outstretched hands. The gate was open even though the sign said it was closed. \u00a0 I took the first step on the gravel path.\u00a0 Time slipped, I was on my knees, a headstone out in front of me.\u00a0 I must have looked from afar like some midnight mourner but I hadn\u2019t even read the name.\u00a0 I stared down into the dirt and saw I had already begun ripping up the sod revealing the pregnant soil beneath.\u00a0 Was there one last ounce of hesitation in me? No, I don't think there was.\u00a0 I could smell her waiting for me down there, six feet of earth and it still filled my nose like honey.\u00a0 I began to dig with my hands, desperately scrabbling at the earth.\u00a0 Pull out great hunks of black earth, dirt forcing itself under my nails, small rocks cutting my palms.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t care.\u00a0 I began to weep as I realised I couldn\u2019t possibly do this without a shovel or some tool.\u00a0 That\u2019s when the light washed over me and my heart froze.\n\n\n\nIt was him.\u00a0 The caretaker stood with an ancient hurricane lantern in hand, its light casting stark shadows over his face.\u00a0 In this light he looked far older than I remembered.\u00a0 I had frozen, dirt in both hands at the sight of him.\u00a0 I opened my mouth to say\u2026 something, and all that came out were thick rivulets of drool.\u00a0 My mind raced, the smell drove me to dig, my brain drove me to run.\u00a0 I had almost decided on trying to bludgeon the caretaker and make a run for it when he spoke in that soft voice:\n\n\n\n\u201cYou poor boy, you must be starving.\u201d his eyes were solemn as he looked at me.\u00a0 Could it have been empathy?\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2013I can explain\u2026\u201d I started, no idea what I was going to say, overwhelmed completely.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to, just come with me.\u00a0 Let's set you right.\u201d He said.\u00a0 There was perhaps the faintest hint of a smile on his face then, perhaps it was just a trick of the guttering lamplight.\u00a0 I let the dirt fall from my blackened hands and rose from my knee-deep hole in the earth.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening to me?\u201d I asked.\u00a0 The shame ran back into me like a flood and I began to blubber again, spit and snot mingling around my mouth.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere, there my boy.\u201d The caretaker closed the distance between us and held me in his arms for a minute before he looked me in the eyes with utter seriousness. \u201cSomething wonderful, I promise.\u00a0 You\u2019ll be feeling right as rain if you just walk with me now.\u00a0 You\u2019ve come a very long way but you only have a few more steps.\u201d.\u00a0 He began to lead me gently down the path.\u00a0 Gravel crunched underfoot and was the only sound in the silence of the cemetery.\u00a0 I saw that we were coming to the caretaker\u2019s workshop.\u00a0 It was a small white building, almost a church in miniature.\u00a0 From within, unsteady candlelight burned.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nWe entered to the smell of motor oil and sawdust and above it all, the heavenly odour of the rotted dead.\u00a0 When we came to the workshop\u2019s back room, the table was already set.\u00a0 Fine china and small silver forks and wicked sharp knives, set for two.\u00a0 The centerpiece of the wide table was a long oak coffin, half rotted away.\u00a0 Candles had been placed at the corners of the coffin and the caretaker bade me sit at one of the set places.\u00a0 Reaching into his coat pocket he brought out a crowded keychain and carefully selected one.\u00a0 He slid it into the lock and as I heard the click of it coming open it was all I could do not to leap from my chair and push him aside as the smell of tantalizing rot seemed to double in the room.\u00a0 He spoke some words then, some I understood and some that I did not.\u00a0 It was a benediction of sorts, a thanksgiving.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cBlessed is the carrion and blessed in he who tasteth the graveyard\u2019s fruit.\u00a0 We thank the ground for yielding her gifts to us. We thank the stars for sheltering us.\u00a0 We thank the empty vessel for remembering life, that it may be passed to us.\u00a0 Blessed are we by dark earth and black heavens, that we shall feast tonight.\u201d He spoke it with whispered ritual cadence.\u00a0 Then, the small silver knife was in his hands and he was cutting.\u00a0 I watched as he deftly split rotted flesh from the corpse of a woman.\u00a0 The meat was dry in places, wet in others; it was speckled with pale purples and reds.\u00a0 He started with the cheek.\u00a0 He separated it with a few quick strokes revealing pale jaw and teeth underneath and then he set it on my plate.\u00a0 \u201cTake. Eat. *Live*.\u201d The three words were in the same ritual cadence and as soon as he spoke I descended on the meat with the desperation of a drowning man.\n\n\n\nIt was like nothing I had ever tasted.\u00a0 Black, greasy, mealy, and yet sweeter than honeydew.\u00a0 More intoxicating than wine.\u00a0 It satisfied the indescribable need that bound itself in tight coils throughout my body.\u00a0 It was pure relief.\u00a0 The caretaker placed slice after slice of the prime cuts on my plate and my aching, screaming hunger was finally answered.\u00a0 When I had eaten my fill, the caretaker set a few pieces on his own plate and then closed and locked the coffin lid.\u00a0 As I sat in a warm haze of emotion and satiation he broke the silence.\n\n\n\nHe spoke to me of many things that long and deep night.\u00a0 I will not tell you most of it.\u00a0 He spoke to me of dark earth, old countries, and ancient laws.\u00a0 He told me of his life, long and sweet, how he had worked plots like these since he was an apprentice under a master far older than he was even now.\u00a0 That night he showed me the grandness of what I had become, the beauty and the comfort of it.\u00a0 He offered me a job.\u00a0 He offered me a life.\u00a0 When I asked him why choose me his answer was simple.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen we met I told you that good deeds should be rewarded, yes?\u00a0 I have no greater gift for you than this\u201d he gestured at the dining ware and the candles burning low, \u201cI am in need of an apprentice besides.\u00a0 I chose you because nobody had shared an umbrella with me in my long years of this work, few have ever shared more than a couple terse words with me. I scrub the headstones clean, keep the plots free of weeds.\u00a0 In my work I have done nothing but bring closure and comfort and I am made a pariah for it. I have never done harm to the living, have never taken anything that wasn\u2019t willingly surrendered to the earth.\u00a0 I have lived a graceful but lonely life since I came to this country and I want to share the goodness of it with somebody.\u00a0 It seemed right that it was you.\u201d.\u00a0 It did seem right.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve been working at the cemetery on the corner of Elk and Monroe for three months now.\u00a0 I\u2019ve dropped out of university, I\u2019m just too busy.\u00a0 The hours are good; the company is excellent.\u00a0 Six days a week in the shade of the cemetery, where the air is sweet and cool.\u00a0 \n\n\n\nLooking back, I do not know what I was afraid of.\u00a0 The illness is already a distant memory and the reward was more than enough.  As for the appetites, The Caretaker is right, we don\u2019t take anything that wasn\u2019t given to our cemetery.\u00a0 We serve in the moment of people\u2019s mourning and are paid our wages under the sheltering night sky.\u00a0 The Caretaker has been very pleased with my work.\u00a0 Even with the two of us we\u2019re just so busy, I have no idea how he managed it alone for so long.\u00a0 The dead keep coming in the gates, carried on the shoulders of their loved ones, and we plant them deep in our soil to ripen.\u00a0 I think he\u2019ll be hiring again soon, we just need to find the right fit.\u00a0 Stop by some day if you\u2019re in the area.\u00a0 We\u2019re on the corner of Elk and Monroe, we\u2019d love to say hello and shake your hand."},"63":{"title":"My Reflection Isn't Mine Anymore. It's Practicing. (Part 2)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1khamtd\/my_reflection_isnt_mine_anymore_its_practicing\/","flair":"Series","author":"GrandLeopard3","selftext":"Living on the couch now. Permanent resident. Day\u2026 eleven? Twelve? Time\u2019s gone slurry, viscous, unreliable. Measured in lukewarm instant coffee and my heart trying to beat its way out. Haven't set foot inside the bedroom since the hall mirror\u2026 performed its silent, breathless autopsy. Door stays shut, chair wedged tightly under the knob. Pathetic, useless defense. Doesn\u2019t matter anyway. The feeling of being watched is a constant, clammy, suffocating pressure, leaking like toxic gas from every potentially reflective surface. Laptop screen when dark, phone glass between obsessive scrolls, window panes slick with grime, the greasy curve of a spoon in the sink. Caught a sickening ripple, like heat haze but emanating palpable cold, distort the reflection on the chrome kettle yesterday when I walked past quickly, eyes averted. It can use anything. Anywhere it can see me. Any surface holding even a ghost of my image.\n\n\n\nThe exhaustion is a physical illness now, a deep, grinding ache in my bones, a persistent, nauseating buzz behind my eyes. Hands shake so badly I spilled coffee again this morning \u2013 ugly brown Rorschach patterns on the worn floorboards. Thoughts feel\u2026 slippery, fragmented, like trying to hold wet soap. Keep zoning out, staring blankly at the wall, coming back with a jolt, unsure what I meant to do. Short-term memory feels full of holes. Did I really leave the milk out again? Found it warm, slightly sour. Did I imagine hearing that sharp floorboard creak right behind me washing dishes, spinning around to find nothing? The doubt is a separate, insidious horror, a fifth column whispering maybe it's just you breaking down. Maybe Maya was right.\n\n\n\nBut then the cold numbness flares up unpredictably on my left arm \u2013 the exact spot where I felt that impossible icy pressure slide across my skin. Not constant, maybe a few times a day, a phantom chill distinct from the apartment\u2019s damp coldness, making fine hairs stand rigidly on end like static charge. A visceral, physical anchor screaming That was real. This is real. Something touched me.\n\n\n\nTried covering the hallway mirror again. Brown kraft paper, half a roll of duct tape. Felt absurdly like warding off vampires with garlic. Stood with my back pressed hard against the opposite wall, didn\u2019t look as I fumbled awkwardly, breath catching shallowly. Ripped it all down less than an hour later in a fresh wave of suffocating panic. The feeling of focused observation hadn\u2019t lessened; it just felt intensely concentrated behind the paper, pressing outwards palpably, more intense and menacing for being unseen. Utterly pointless. It\u2019s not in the mirror. The mirror is just\u2026 porous. A weak spot where it looks through. Or maybe, eventually, pushes through.\n\n\n\nStarted noticing the breathing again. Or maybe hearing it more clearly through the fear-fog. Late at night, city quieted to a low hum, sometimes I hear it clearly. A faint, slow, wet inhalation\u2026 followed by a long, sighing exhalation that seems to stir the dust motes, carrying a faint but distinct whiff of that sharp metallic\/ozone smell, maybe with burnt hair underneath now. Makes me gag sometimes. Doesn't seem to come from one specific place, more like\u2026 the heating vents? Spaces between crumbling plaster walls? Seems subtly timed with unnatural shifts in temperature, pockets of cold air pulsing faintly with the \u2018out-breath\u2019. Like the building itself is harnessed as a lung by something parasitic. Using its decay. Maybe that smell near the fuse box is its\u2026 respiration? Waste? God, the thoughts feel contaminated, spiraling.\n\n\n\nSearched online again, compulsively, hopelessly. Gave up 'mirror ghosts'. Too simple. Focused on the address, building history, old maps, local historical society archives \u2013 anything about the ground itself. Hours lost scrolling faded scans, eyes aching under the laptop glare. Found fragmented references. This specific area called \"Cinder Marsh\" or morbidly \"Wicklow's Mire\" before the city sprawled over it. Unpopular plot. Swampy ground that 'resisted' early drainage attempts according to a dry 1910 engineering report \u2013 mentioned inexplicable equipment failures, tool breakages, persistent worker unease bordering on mutiny. Found that chilling snippet again, scanned local newspaper, 1892 \u2013 small family homestead near the marsh edge found abruptly abandoned. Doors banging open, half-eaten meal rotting on the table, occupants vanished without trace. Article quoted a frightened neighbor mentioning the family plagued by \"ill-luck, strange reflections seen in the marsh water even on cloudy days, and deeply unsettling mimicry heard in the calls of the night birds.\" Nothing concrete. Just faint whispers across a century of bad ground. A sense of the place itself being inherently wrong. Predatory?\n\n\n\nThe scraping sound came back last night. Against the living room window, slick with cold rain. Louder this time. Sharper. Definitely not fingernails, not branches. More like\u2026 shards of rock, or maybe dry, sharp bone, being dragged deliberately, rhythmically across the glass? Scrrreee\u2026 pause\u2026 skriiiitch\u2026 Set my teeth painfully on edge, vibrated deep in my jawbone. Followed by that faint, wet clicking sound again, seemingly coming right off the shivering glass pane itself. Click\u2026 click-click\u2026 Like something tasting the barrier. Testing its strength. Lasted almost two minutes, an eternity of frozen listening. Sat rigid on the couch, hands balled into white-knuckled fists, sweat trickling cold down my back, until blessed, heavy, watchful silence fell again.\n\n\n\nObject manipulation feels less random now, more\u2026 pointedly intrusive. Came back from the bathroom this morning (rapid, eyes-half-closed ordeal) to find my laptop, left closed on the coffee table, now sitting wide open. Screen dark. But sitting squarely on the center of the keyboard, draped over the 'H' key? A single long, dark strand of human hair. Definitely not mine \u2013 mine\u2019s light brown, shedding from stress anyway. Whose was it? Felt like a trophy deliberately left behind. Or a territorial marking. Claiming my space, my tools.\n\n\n\nReflection glitches are rare now, almost nonexistent, because the baseline mimicry is so terrifyingly, flawlessly perfect. But when they happen, they\u2019re more disturbing. Caught my reflection in the microwave door glass waiting for water for yet another cup of awful coffee. Just for a split second, the reflection's eyes flickered sideways, unmistakably, towards the butcher block holding my kitchen knives beside the microwave. Head tilted slightly. Lingered. Like thinking about them. Before snapping back instantly to meet my own startled gaze. It wasn't mirroring me; I was staring straight ahead. It was looking independently. Assessing. At the knives. My stomach plummeted, cold and heavy as lead.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s learning faster. Interacting more deliberately. Sounds, moved objects, the intimate violation of the hair, the independent, assessing glances\u2026 feels like it\u2019s consolidating its presence, pushing outwards from the reflections into the physical space. Into my space. Maybe testing what it can affect. Preparing for something more direct.\n\n\n\nTried the landlord again. Voice shaking, trying desperately to sound rational. Mentioned scraping (\"Maybe rats? Big ones?\"), moved objects (framed carefully as intruder concerns, knowing it sounded insane), cold drafts, electrical smell. He sighed, that world-weary landlord sigh. \"Look,\" he said, patience worn thin, \"it's an old building. Makes noises. Maybe get some thicker curtains? Put out some traps yourself if you really think it's rats. I'll send Gary the handyman again next week if you absolutely insist, but honestly, he won't find anything new.\" Pointless. Utterly, terrifyingly pointless. Nobody is coming. Nobody believes me. I am entirely alone with this.\n\n\n\nThe apartment doesn\u2019t feel like my space anymore. It feels occupied. Infiltrated. Like its territory now, and I\u2019m the increasingly inconvenient, maybe interesting, maybe edible, infestation it's patiently studying. Everything feels subtly contaminated. Light feels wrong, too harsh or too dim. Shadows pool in corners with unnatural, watching depth. That metallic tang seems ever-present, coating the back of my throat, a taste I can't wash away. Am I imagining the intensification? Hyper-vigilance feeding paranoia? Breakdown accelerating?\n\n\n\nOr is it really learning? Adapting? Moving from watching and mimicking to\u2026 affecting? Preparing for the next stage?\n\n\n\nThe worst part is the constant, gnawing waiting. Knowing the next escalation is coming. Feeling that heavy, listening silence descend, hearing that chitinous scrape on the glass like claws testing the boundary, catching a reflection that isn't quite right for a horrifying split second before the mask snaps flawlessly back into place\u2026 and wondering when it will stop pretending altogether. Wondering when the mask will finally drop for good, and what nightmare I\u2019ll see staring back at me from my own eyes."},"64":{"title":"I Killed My Mom","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kgv05q\/i_killed_my_mom\/","flair":null,"author":"OneAirport8428","selftext":"\n\nI was 13 when we moved to Ashfield.

Even dark desires want to be fulfilled.\n\nMy mom called me to help her to set up the wooden table we had that stood in our garden.\n\n\u201cMike, stop listening to his rap music crap of yours and help your mother.\u201d\n\nI rolled my eyes, luckily she did not see that or she would have spanked me so hard I would not have been able to sit for 3 days. I loved my mom, but she was tough. It was not easy for her, raising me alone after my dad died in a car crash.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI entered the garden, wearing baggy shorts and my bulls jersey, she wore her favorite summer dress.\n\n\u201cMike, I told you many times to stop looking like a thug. Why can\u2019t you dress normally like the other children?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other children are boring.\u201d I went to the kitchen, I grabbed the plates, forks and knives. When I went back to the garden I saw, mom was talking to our Neighbor Mr. Jenkins. I hated his guts, he always smelled cheap after shave and cigarettes. He always flirted with mom, and she did it back. One day I can remember hearing strange sounds from Mom\u2019s bedroom. Jimmy said they had probably sex, I did not believe it.\n\n\u201cHey Champ, how are you today?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d\n\nMy mom slapped the back of my head. She wanted me to be nicer to our neighbor. I did not care.\n\nI never understood why he always called me champ, only my dad called me like this. Maybe this was one of the reasons I hated him so deeply.\u00a0\n\nI thought my day was ruined but then I heard Jimmy shouting from the other side of our fence.\n\n\u201cYo, my mom allowed me to take Rex to your party.\u201d Rex was his German shepherd, the best dog in the world. I opened the door for him. We dapped each other up, and I patted Rex.\n\n\u201cMom, can we and Jimmy go to my room and listen to music?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure my dear but the dog will not enter the house.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs we entered my room, he pulled something out of his pockets.\n\n\u201cI stole the cigs of my dad, lets try them. They must be good when all the adults are smoking them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, my mom is gonna kill me when she finds out I smoked.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, don\u2019t be a pussy. Even the lover of your mom is smoking cigs.\u201d\n\nI pushed him hard, \u201cHe is not the lover of my mom, dickhead.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever, let's smoke one.\u201d He lit the cigarette, he tried it first. I can only remember how bad they tasted. Me and him were probably coughing for five minutes after that. I never touched a cigarette after that. I knew I did something wrong, but the feeling of doing something forbidden was fun. The little rush we got doing stupid things only we knew about made It worth it. We opened the window and sprayed some cologne in my room to hide the smell of the cigs, in hindsight very stupid because every adult would still smell them immediately but we were kids.\n\nRex was barking at something in my garden and it bothered the early guests that arrived. My told Jimmy to come down and to calm down his dog or bring Rex back to his home. We both rushed down, to see what was going on with Rex. He was in the back of the garden, barking at the ground. As we arrived he started to dig a hole. I panicked because my mom would have definitely killed me if she would have seen that.\n\n\u201cTell Rex to stop or I am going to die.\u201d\n\n\u201cCalm down, let me handle this.\u201d Jimmy always had this calm attitude when things went wrong and I admired him for that but in this moment he pissed me off. First the cigs and now the hole, I felt like he really wanted me to be in trouble. Jimmy calmed down Rex but he was suspiciously quiet. Normally, Jimmy never shuts up. He called me over. I saw a small hole and between the mud and dirt was a little black box, nothing was special about it.\n\n\u201cWhy is there a black box buried in your garden?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe the previous owner buried it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to see what\u2019s in there.\u201d\n\nI took the box and tried to open it, but my spaghetti arms were too weak.\n\n\u201cYou need a key, dickhead.\u201d was Jimmy\u2019s smart ass response.\n\nI went to my mom with the box, I thought maybe she knew something about it. She was talking to Jenkins, both were really drunk and very touchy. It made me sick to my stomach, I saw a knife laying on the table. My first instinct was to drop the box, grab the knife and cut Jenkins open like a pig.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut before I could finish my murderous fantasy, someone grabbed me by my arm and dragged me into the living room. It was Rebecca, but I always called her Becky.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want from me, Becky?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing, but you looked like you wanted to kill someone so I got curious.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of your business.\u201d\n\nShe pointed at the black box that I was still holding in my hands. Becky was like every other girl, simply annoying.\n\n\u201cAgain, it\u2019s none of your business. Go to the other girls and play with some Barbies or something.\u201d I always played it cool around girls, Jimmy told me that's what they really like. She came close to me, I could feel her breath. I thought she would kiss me so I closed my eyes. She whispered in my ear.\n\n\u201cEveryone in Ashfield knows your mom is fucking Jenkins.\u201d\n\nI got taught to never punch a girl, mom told me this. It was weird because I saw my dad sometimes slapping my mom but I respected it. At this moment I did not care if she was a girl, I wanted to smash her head in with the box. I opened my eyes but she was gone already.\n\n\n\nLater in the evening, I was laying down in my bed, reading some comics. Jimmy left long ago and only a few people were left at the party. I could not sleep, it was hard to sleep when people were talking loudly and listening to this disgusting country music.\n\nI was thirsty, so I went to the kitchen to get a glass of water. When I went past my moms bedroom, I could hear some noises. I opened the door but only a little to get a peak. I saw Jenkins fat back and he was on top of my mom.\n\n\u201cYou like when i fuck you like this you dirty whore.\u201d\n\n\u201c I bet i fuck you better than your husband.\u201d\n\nMy whole body was shaking, Jimmy was right. She was really having sex with Jenkins. Tears formed in my eyes from anger. I stormed into my room. The black box was standing on my desk, looking at me. It was weird, the box was closed the whole day but when I entered my room it was open. I went to the box to see what was inside. It was a picture, a picture of a corpse. A woman's body lying in a bed, she was naked.  I turned the picture around and with red letters it was written.\n\n\u201cKill her.\u201d\n\nI put the picture back into the box, I thought it was one of Jimmy\u2019s pranks. I laid on my bed but what I saw in my mom\u2019s bedroom did not leave my mind. I cried my eyes out from anger, I wish she and Jenkins would die. I could not take it. I took my backpack and I wanted to run away, I did not know where to go. I simply wanted to leave.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAgain, the box looked at me, I decided to look at the picture for the last time. I recognized something in the picture, the blankets and pillows next to the corpse looked like the one mom had. It clicked for me, the picture told me to kill my mom. I started to shake from anxiety, my head was spinning. I wanted to vomit, but then I remembered what I saw.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI went to the kitchen, to get the biggest knife possible. I had the picture on my pockets, I was still unsure but everytime i started to doubt, I remember Jenkins fat back moving up and down. I went back to the bedroom of my mom. Slow and quiet steps, I prayed that Jenkins was still there so I could kill him too. Again I slowly opened the door, he was not there but mom was sleeping. With every step I took closer to my mom, my determination to kill her grew, it was growing witch each step.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI stood next to her, I carefully removed the blanket, she was laying there naked. Her Breasts fully exposed. I could smell his cheap aftershave on her. I started to stab her, I was in a trance. She screamed but out of reflex I stabbed her in the throat and then she sounded like she was drowing. I stabbed her till my arms gave out. My upper body was covered in her blood. She was a bloody mess. I took the picture out of my pocket, she looked exactly like the woman in the picture. She was the woman in the picture.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI felt relieved, I did not even process what I did. I cleaned myself up, and went to Jenkins House. I broke into it, and I entered his bedroom. I did not kill him, I placed the knife in his hands and went back home. I called the police, and Jenkins got arrested.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat all was 28 Years ago, Jenkins is still in prison. From time to time I look at the picture. After I killed my mom, the red letters disappeared. There was a new message on the back.\n\n\u201cGood job, Champ.\u201d"},"65":{"title":"I'm an urban explorer. I visited some village ruins on the outskirts of town. And something found me there...","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kh1e8a\/im_an_urban_explorer_i_visited_some_village_ruins\/","flair":null,"author":"storyscript","selftext":"We don\u2019t know how long she\u2019s been here. Even some of the oldest people in our town admit she was already a legend when they were kids.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter recent events, I need to write this down to make sense of everything. Lest I go insane.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFrom my mother's story, she used to be a normal Mobian. Her name is debated. Some say it was Swirl, others say it was Twist, and a ton others. She was a lemur, one that lived in Spiral Village herself. She was a cheery girl at the time, said to light up the town with her boundless energy.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe lived alongside her love, a wolf whose name was said to be spoken in only whispers. They were said to be inseparable, constantly at each other's side. Some say it was a love so innocent and pure that it would make you feel lighter just being around them.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHowever, one day, she found a note from her love, simply stating she had gone out to finish a fight she had long since started. She looked all day for the wolf, asking around to anyone she knew. Eventually, she found her.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDead.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAccounts vary on what happened; some say that the wolf was stabbed to death, others that she had been shot, and others say that the lemur killed her herself. Though the stabbing story seems to be the original from my research. On that day, people could hear the lemur's broken cries for miles, as her heart bled out alongside the wolf.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe disappeared after that, gone for months, with no one knowing where she might have gone. The wolf was also reported missing, with no one knowing of her death at the time. But then, the wolf came back, seemingly fine, smiling even, though she seemed to get agitated whenever they asked about the lemur.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNo word was heard from the lemur, with the wolf seeming far too happy despite her love being gone. Some wondered what had happened, with rumors beginning. At that time, the lemur came back, seemingly fine. She greeted everyone with a smile.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut something was wrong.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHer smile, once so bright, now looked hollow, like a pathetic copy of what once was. Her movements were odd, limbs moving ever so slightly unnatural. Despite this, those who didn\u2019t know her personally were happy that she had returned.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut those who did could tell something was amiss.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSoon, everyone could see the problems between the wolf and the lemur. Their fights were constant, though they stayed together. Despite the attempts from others, they kept fighting.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDuring this time, the massacres started. Those who dared commit crimes too horrid to speak of were found brutally murdered. First, it was small injuries, lacerations, and bruises. But it soon escalated until entire buildings were covered in flesh, with the monsters in them being brutalized beyond recognition, as if a demon had come from the depths of hell to punish them.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut one day, it reason behind all of it was revealed.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe lemur and wolf had been sent to find a criminal, one whose name has been forgotten. When they got there with their friend, they began the battle with them. During the fight, they had managed to cut the wolf\u2019s face, slicing through her skin. In that moment, the lemur froze, her body fading in and out of existence as the wolf panicked. She cried, repeating \u2018no\u2019 over and over. When the lemur faded, the wolf turned\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\nShowing the lemur\u2019s face behind the wolf\u2019s skin.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe rest of the story depends on the teller; some say she was saved, others say she was a demon that returned to hell. But overall, she was still a legend.\n\n\u00a0\n\nA legend I have seen with my own eyes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI'm an urban explorer, but beyond the ruins of Spiral City were the ruins of Spiral Hill Village. It had long since been abandoned, some say because of the lemur. I decided to explore, having never been there myself. I took a small amount of food and water, alongside some tools to get around, namely a crowbar, a camera, a rope, and a torch.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe drive wasn\u2019t long, only taking around an hour to get there. As the village got closer, something I noticed was that the sky seemed to close up as I got closer. The clouds got darker, the wind colder, even the plants seemed to slowly get more and more wild, stretching and growing beyond what would be seen anywhere in the city limits. The whole place had a sense of abandonment, but more importantly, the feeling of utter sadness. A feeling that this had once been something great, not reduced to nothing but a forgotten memory.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs I got out of my car, the sun wasn\u2019t visible through the clouds, but there was enough light to not need to waste my torch battery. I walked through the abandoned town, looking through the collapsing buildings. There were multiple things that I found: photos, art pieces, and even some jewelry. However, I didn\u2019t take anything, deciding to leave the ruins and the homes of these families as is.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut as I walked, something felt\u2026 wrong. I don\u2019t know how to describe it. It felt like there were eyes everywhere, like I had just entered somewhere that didn\u2019t want me. Like I had walked into some dark realm where I should have never entered. I didn\u2019t think much of it at the time. The weather and the overall state of the city made everything feel off, and I\u2019m not ashamed to say that I\u2019m not exactly the bravest, so the feeling wasn\u2019t something that came off as unnatural. So I foolishly walked in.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHowever, two buildings seemed oddly\u2026 fine.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey had cracks and chips, but overall, you\u2019d never know these were over a hundred years old. The first was a museum, or at least I think it was, if the glass display panels and panels with some jewels everywhere were any indication. I looked through the main office, finding a drawer with some old documents. It had belonged to someone named Jewel the Beetle. I knew her; she and her family had formed the Jewel Museum in the city, where memorabilia and trinkets from past heroes like Sonic and Tails were kept. Nothing had ever been said of her living here before, but considering how long it had been since she had been around, it made sense.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter placing the documents back and taking some pictures with my camera, I walked out and found another building. This one was a house, a big one. Entering it, the inside was light stepping back in time. The place looked untouched and completely clean. The carpets were pristine, the walls painted, and the air fresh. It threw me for a loop, making me have to recompose myself for a second. Once I did, I explored the home, finding multiple photos.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey showed a wolf and a lemur. The lemur had her arm around the wolf, both of them smiling. They looked so happy, the lemur\u2019s smile so bright that I couldn\u2019t help but mimic it. Underneath the photo, a message was written.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**\u2018Tangle and Whisper\u2019**\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Multiple other photos were around the house. Some showed them at a beach, one with them sitting beside a sheep, and another with them in what looked like a town center, and many more. Each one looked so happy and cheerful, a contradiction to the state of the town.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs I looked, and brought out a cloth and cleaned some of the photos, as dust had piled up on some. As I did, the feeling of being watched eased a bit, though I didn\u2019t know why. I kept looking, I came upon a door leading to what I assumed was a basement. Going down, I found the door unlocked and walked inside.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI wish I hadn\u2019t.\n\n\u00a0\n\nInside, the basement was hot. Unnaturally hot. It was dark enough that I turned on my torch. The light shone on what looked like a massive map. Hundreds of photos and strings were strewn over it. Each photo showed a purple octopus with black eyes and white pupils. Journals and books lay around me, their writing so messy and chaotic that I couldn\u2019t even begin to understand them. But I couldn\u2019t focus on that as something caught my attention. That was a buzzing sound.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLooking back, one of the support pillars for the basement was\u2026glitching. I know it sounds strange, but it was glitching, its form flickering in blue. It kept doing so before it finally disappeared.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd a pillar of flesh is what I was met with.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt reached the ceiling, stretching across it like a mold. Eyes bulged from it, all of them purple and watching him. And soon, everything around me began to glitch, as more and more flesh formed around me. I fell to the ground as more and more eyes appeared, all of them staring at me. But that wasn\u2019t the part that truly scared me.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt was when I heard footsteps from up above.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI had come here alone. I knew that. And while it could have been another explorer, I knew it wasn\u2019t. Call it an instinct, but my gut knew that whatever walked up above was no Mobian.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe footsteps continued before they got close to the basement door. I ducked behind some of the furniture that hadn\u2019t disappeared. And not a moment too soon, as the door creaked open, the footsteps came down the stairs. What followed were ragged breaths, ones that sounded like the owner's lungs were barely holding on. I stayed quiet, hoping whatever had entered wouldn\u2019t see me. But as a violet light shone right at the furniture I was hiding behind and eyes formed next to me, watching me, I knew that wouldn\u2019t be the case.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe breathing got closer, the footsteps getting louder. I was barely keeping it together as I pulled out the one thing I had brought just in case. A bottle of pepper spray. I wasn\u2019t much, and I had wished I had brought something more powerful, but I would work\u2026hopefully.\n\n\u00a0\n\nRight when I could hear the entity right behind me, and turned and sprayed them, and a horrific and high-pitched scream rang out. I got up from my hiding place and ran to the door, only turning back once to see what had entered.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd I felt my heart stop.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe entity had the body of a Mobian. But multiple appendages were sticking out of its body. Claws, arms, and what looked like cameras, all sprouting from their back. But that wasn\u2019t the worst part.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt was the fact that I knew the being in front of me.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt was the lemur I had seen in the photos. Her white and blue fur was easily recognizable.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTangle.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAlongside the rotting skin of the wolf, of Whisper, I had seen in the photos with her.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe skin was practically falling apart from her body, with some parts seemingly stitched onto the lemur. Entire parts were missing, showing the flesh beneath the skin. But I could see blood from what looked like scratches and knife marks on the lemur\u2019s real skin. Alongside that, I saw a strange three-pronged symbol in her right eye, now red from the pepper spray.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt took me a moment to break out of the shock, but I ran up the stairs and out of the house when I did. No sooner did I leave the house than the entire village began to glitch as I heard what sounded like a guttural scream and wolf howl echoing from behind me.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs it rang out, the buildings shifted as their walls were covered in flesh, eyes watching my every move, finally understanding why I had that watched feeling. Similar appendages to the ones that the lemur had formed from the masses, claws stretching out to grab me. Alongside it, camera-like appendages formed as well. They had the rough shape of a security camera, but instead of a lens, cloudy white eyes were stuck to them. Blood and mucus spilled under them as a purple glow came from them, following my every move.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThings only got worse as I heard the sound of something running next to me. Looking up, I saw the lemur running along the rooftops, her eyes glaring at me as she chased me down. As I ran, I made it to the tree line as I ran through it. I could hear branches cracking as it still gave chase. I couldn\u2019t see her well, but I could hear her swinging along the branches, launching herself from tree to tree. I had almost reached my car before something grabbed my leg and yanked me to the ground.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMy forehead slammed against the ground hard, the sound of my camera going off hitting my ears. As I got up, I could feel blood slowly drip down and over my eyes. But I couldn\u2019t focus on that as the sound of growling hit my ears. Spinning around, I saw a tendril had wrapped around my leg, having sprouted from the lemur\u2019s back. She was glaring at me, crawling closer on all fours. Like a wolf stalking its prey.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs she got closer, some of those camera appendages formed, before they started nudging her. She looked at them for a second as small tentacles extended from them and connected to her next. Her eyes glowed as she went quiet. Behind her, I saw\u2026myself.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nI saw myself going through the town, from what I could only was the point of view of the eyes. They showed me looking through the buildings, being careful the entire time, putting the files from the museum back into the drawer, and cleaning the pictures back at the home.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt went on like that for a few seconds before the lemur finally moved again, looking back at me. Her face, once filled with rage, now showed confusion, and then understanding. She studied me for a second before her eyes widened, a quiet whine coming from her. One of the cameras formed as a purple light washed over me. It stayed for a second before it disappeared. Once it did, the lemur hand twitched before a strange symbol, one that matched the one in her eye, but was glowing purple, formed in her hand.\n\n\u00a0\n\nInstantly, I felt the pain around my body fade, as the small cuts I had gotten from the fall vanished alongside the blood. Once it was all healed, the tendril released my leg as the lemur got up and began to leave. She immediately climbed up the tree, giving me one more apologetic look before disappearing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter that, I picked up my camera and left.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI\u2026I know what I saw was the being from the city\u2019s old legend. The Purple Demon, the Skinwalker, the Solver. The same one they had used as a simple ghost story. Was the one I had encountered.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI haven\u2019t told anyone close to me. God knows what they would think of it. But that wasn\u2019t the only reason. The only reason I had been let go, from what I could tell, was because I hadn\u2019t disturbed anything in the town, and had even helped clean some of the objects. If I revealed its existence, no doubt more would go looking for it, and I do not doubt that some of them would damage, if not destroy, the ruins to try and find the Solver. And god knows what it would do then.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo I have kept quiet, but I\u2019m sharing this now since it seems to have vanished recently, alongside the ruins of Spiral Hill Village. I\u2019m posting this here due to this being a more underground forum where everyone understands the danger of angering an entity like this.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHowever, I leave you with one more thing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen my camera fell off and I took a photo when I fell, a photo was taken of the lemur, of Tangle. I have attached it to this post.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI beg anyone, if you have any information, please tell me so I know I\u2019m not crazy here.\n\n  \n[Out-Dated-Solution.png](https:\/\/postimg.cc\/R33qtV6B)"},"66":{"title":"The Sky Cracked Open pt2","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kgx91e\/the_sky_cracked_open_pt2\/","flair":null,"author":"FibonaccisUnconstant","selftext":"Link to pt1 https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/s\/iT9sJbQMnU\n\n\nI haven\u2019t left the property since that night.\n\nFood delivery drops at the end of the gravel road. I wait until the driver\u2019s gone, then I collect the bags with gloves on. Cameras cover every inch of my land\u2014thermal, night vision, motion-triggered. Not that they help much. The things that come don\u2019t trip sensors. They just arrive.\n\nThree nights ago, the countdown ended.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t dramatic. No sirens, no booming voice from the sky. Just\u2026 silence again. That same dead quiet from before. My clocks all froze at 2:13 AM. Every screen in the house went black\u2014phones, laptop, even my digital watch. I could feel it in my bones\u2014something had shifted.\n\nThen came the scratching.\n\nIt started in the attic. A slow scrape, like claws dragging along the inside of the beams. Not frantic, not random. Purposeful. I grabbed the shotgun from the hall closet, even though I knew it wouldn\u2019t matter. You don\u2019t kill shadows with buckshot.\n\nI crept up the attic ladder. The scratching stopped. The air felt thick, like breathing through syrup. My flashlight flickered. I whispered, \u201cI\u2019m not ready,\u201d just to see if the voice would answer again.\n\nIt did.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t in my head this time.\n\nFrom behind the insulation came a voice\u2014clear, almost human, but echoing like it was spoken down a long, wet tunnel:\n\u201cNow you are.\u201d\n\nThe insulation bulged. I fired without thinking. The blast blew out a cloud of fiberglass and something else\u2014thick, clear slime that hissed when it hit the floorboards. My eyes burned from it. I fell back down the ladder, coughing and blind.\n\nWhen I could see again, there were prints on the wall. Not footprints. Handprints. Long-fingered, webbed, almost reptilian. They led across the ceiling, down the wall, and out the back door. I hadn\u2019t even heard it open.\n\nThat\u2019s when I knew the game had changed.\n\nThey weren\u2019t just watching anymore. They were inside.\n\nI tried to call someone. No signal. I tried to leave. My truck wouldn\u2019t start. The engine was fine\u2014it just wouldn\u2019t engage. Like something was jamming it at the molecular level. When I popped the hood, the battery was gone. Not stolen. Gone. No signs of removal\u2014just smooth plastic where the connections should\u2019ve been. Like it never existed.\n\nSo I waited.\n\nLast night, they came back. Not one this time. Three.\n\nI didn\u2019t see them arrive. One second the yard was empty, the next they were just there. Standing perfectly still, facing the house. Seven feet tall. Bent like praying mantises. Skin like black velvet stretched over exposed bone. No eyes. No mouth. But I could hear them thinking.\n\nAnd they were thinking about me.\n\nI stepped out onto the porch, shotgun useless in my hands. I didn\u2019t know what they wanted. I just knew hiding was done.\n\nThe tallest one moved first. It floated\u2014not hovered\u2014just\u2026 disconnected from gravity. It stopped ten feet from me. And then it spoke.\n\nNot in words. Not even in thoughts. It just opened itself, and I understood.\n\n\u201cYou held the key. You tuned the frequency. You brought the beacon.\u201d\n\nAnd then, suddenly, I remembered.\n\nThe cube.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t a memory I had before. But it unfolded in my mind like I\u2019d always known. Years ago, as a kid, I found something in the woods. A small box, humming faintly, half-buried near a dead deer with no eyes. I kept it in a drawer for years until it vanished one night.\n\nI didn\u2019t bring the beacon that night a few weeks ago. I activated it.\n\nThey\u2019ve been coming ever since.\n\nThe being reached toward me. Not threatening\u2014just expectant. Like it was time to finish something.\n\nI don\u2019t remember reaching back. I just remember contact.\n\nAnd then\u2014\n\nThe sky opened.\n\nBut this time, it wasn\u2019t a crack. It was a hole. Circular. Precise. A perfect absence in the sky, revealing stars I\u2019d never seen before, constellations that moved.\n\nFrom it came a sound. Not a scream. Not a roar. A chord. Music in a frequency you don\u2019t hear\u2014you feel. My teeth rattled. My bones ached. And my mind\u2026 it expanded.\n\nFor one second, I saw everything. All of it. The cities burning. The oceans empty. The towers rising. The great migration between galaxies. The farmed planets. The marked species. And us\u2014just starting to bloom. Not unique. Not special. Just another trial run.\n\nI screamed. I think.\n\nAnd then I was back on the porch. Alone.\n\nNo beings. No hole in the sky. No light. Just the ache behind my eyes and a feeling that something big had taken notice.\n\nTonight, I hear the humming again. But not from outside.\n\nIt\u2019s coming from under the house.\n\nI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re coming to finish something\u2026 or start something new.\n\nBut I know one thing:\n\nThis time, we\u2019re not being visited.\n\nWe\u2019re being claimed.\n\n"},"67":{"title":"I found something in the woods behind my house that I wish I could forget","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kgqj09\/i_found_something_in_the_woods_behind_my_house\/","flair":null,"author":"Superb_Tune4135","selftext":"\nI need to tell someone about this. I haven't slept properly in days, and I'm starting to see things in the corners of my vision. Maybe writing it down will help, or maybe one of you will know what to do. I don't know anymore.\n\nMy house sits at the edge of a small town in northern Maine. The backyard extends about fifty feet before it meets the treeline of a dense forest that stretches for miles. I've lived here for three years and have hiked those woods countless times without incident. At least until last week.\n\nI was walking my usual trail last Wednesday afternoon. It was unseasonably warm for May, and I wanted to enjoy the sunshine before the inevitable rain came back. About two miles in, I noticed something odd. The birds had stopped singing. Complete silence. Not even the rustle of leaves in the breeze.\n\nThat's when I saw it\u2014a small clearing off to my right that I'd never noticed before. The grass was dead in a perfect circle, about fifteen feet in diameter. At the center was what looked like a crude stone well, maybe three feet tall.\n\nI approached it cautiously. The stonework looked ancient, covered in a type of moss I'd never seen before\u2014dark purple, almost black. But the strangest thing? The air around it seemed... wrong. Like it was thicker somehow. Each step toward it felt like wading through invisible molasses.\n\nAgainst my better judgment, I peered down into the well. It was too dark to see the bottom, but I could make out something reflective about ten feet down. I took out my phone to use as a flashlight, and that's when I heard it\u2014a soft whisper that seemed to come from directly behind me.\n\n\"*Finally...*\"\n\nI spun around, but there was nobody there. Just the silent forest. My heart was hammering in my chest, but curiosity got the better of me. I turned back to the well and shined my light down.\n\nWhat I saw still haunts me. It wasn't water reflecting my light\u2014it was eyes. Dozens of them, blinking independently of each other. Then they all focused on me at once, and the whisper came again, this time from the well:\n\n\"*We've been waiting for you.*\"\n\nI dropped my phone in shock. It clattered down the well, illuminating something pale and spindly starting to climb up toward me. I ran. I ran faster than I've ever run in my life, not stopping until I burst out of the treeline into my backyard.\n\nThat night, my phone rang. My phone that should have been at the bottom of that well. The caller ID showed my own number. I didn't answer.\n\nThe calls have continued every night since then, always at 3:17 AM. Last night, I finally worked up the courage to answer. There was only breathing on the other end, wet and ragged, before a voice\u2014my voice\u2014whispered:\n\n\"*We're coming up now. We found the way to your home.*\"\n\nI looked out my bedroom window toward the woods and saw lights moving between the trees, approaching slowly. They weren't flashlights. They were too small, too numerous, and they blinked.\n\nThis morning, I found wet, moss-covered footprints on my back porch. Purple-black moss, exactly like what was on the well. And there was a message written in the condensation on my kitchen window, visible only from the inside:\n\n\"*Thank you for the invitation.*\"\n\nI don't know what to do. I can't leave\u2014I tried. My car won't start, and whenever I try to walk down the driveway, I get disoriented and somehow end up back at the house. Cell service is gone, and my internet cuts out whenever I try to look up information about the well or send messages about my situation.\n\nThis is my last attempt to reach out. I'm using my neighbor's unsecured WiFi, which somehow still works. If anyone knows what's happening or how to stop it, please help. I can hear something scratching at the basement door now.\n\nWait. I just realized something. The footprints this morning... they were heading *out* of the house, not in.\n\nOh god. I think they're already inside me.\n\nIf you're ever hiking in the woods of northern Maine and find a strange well, run. Don't look inside. Don't listen to the whispers. \n\nAnd if you get a call from your own number at 3:17 AM, whatever you do, don't answer.\n\nUPDATE: The scratching has stopped. Instead, there's a tapping on my bedroom door. Tap-tap-tap. Pause. Tap-tap-tap. It's been going on for twenty minutes now. I'm going to try to make it to the kitchen for a knife. If I don't update again, tell my family I love them. Though I'm starting to forget what they look like.\n\nUPDATE 2: I looked in the mirror. My eyes are wrong. They're blinking out of sync with each other."},"68":{"title":"Spring","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kgr5zi\/spring\/","flair":null,"author":"wearedefiance","selftext":"The flowers bloomed today. They sprang to life all at once around my home, revealing a hidden kaleidoscope of color. I bore witness to shades and hues I can\u2019t explain, as if I weren\u2019t meant to see them at all, and the colors I could recognize were so vibrant it strained my eyes looking at them. Blues, reds, yellows, pinks, and any other color you could possibly think of danced like the sea inside a vibrant green backdrop. They swayed softly in the wind, in rhythm with the trees looming over them against the blue horizon. It was beautiful, mesmerizing. I found myself lost tracing petal patterns and watching blades of grass wrap themselves around the veiny stems coming from the soil. \n\nI then looked away and realized I had let them in. \n\nLooking at my watch told me that thirty-five minutes had passed in what seemed like seconds. My hands started perspiring as I stared at the open door in front of me. I slowly turned and looked toward the hallway to see dirt trailing to my son\u2019s bedroom. My heart sank but I followed wearily, listening to what sounded like a loud cicada echoing off of the hallway walls. I stopped before reaching for the handle and closed my eyes, my body tensed as thoughts raced through my mind. My hand found the cold metal and I slowly pushed open the door. I strained to open my eyes back up, and as soon as they finally gave me sight again, my perspective on reality shattered.\n\nThere he was, wrapped in a web-like substance hanging from the ceiling. He was nearly a pile of bones at this point; I could see him through the semi-translucent silk. He was being consumed by, well, how do I even explain it? Arachnid-like in ways, centipede-like in others. Its multiple legs wrapped tightly around the webbed body of my son, alongside tentacles crushing whatever was left into a substance that its proboscis sucked down. It writhed and pulsed, its shell clattering as it swelled up. The large stinger remained in the cocoon, acting like a drain plug to keep its meal in place. The creature dwarfed him. He stood no chance; my wife before him stood no chance; and I stand no chance.\n\nEvery spring, they hatch. Their eggs sit beneath the earth and sprout like flowers when they\u2019re nearing maturity, and then they hunt. They bring whatever is left of their victim into a burrow where they lay eggs inside of the cocoon, and they continue to multiply. Whatever toxin their flowers release puts people into a trance and most of the time, causes them to open windows or doors and let them into their homes. They seem to target the young or the elderly, but they've been different, more aggressive. We don\u2019t know what they are, what purpose they serve, or if they\u2019ll ever leave, but I know I\u2019m not making it through it this time and I\u2019m taking everything I can with me. \n\nGasoline and a match, that\u2019s all I need."},"69":{"title":"I just learnt that my \u2018parents\u2019 kidnapped me to save humanity, and they might have failed.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kg9fwe\/i_just_learnt_that_my_parents_kidnapped_me_to\/","flair":null,"author":"Theeaglestrikes","selftext":"[Part I](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1ka1ig2\/i_just_learnt_that_my_parents_kidnapped_me_when_i\/) \u2013 [Part II](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kcchyv\/i_just_learnt_that_my_parents_kidnapped_me\/) \u2013 **Part III (FINAL)**\n\nIt\u2019s baffling to me that the world keeps turning, oblivious to the hellish week I have just endured.\n\nOblivious to the fact that we all scarcely survived the end of the world.\n\nOblivious to the fact that it may still end.\n\nFollowing the events at the foot of that Parisian apartment, the bloody fragments of Blueman and the shattered cultists inexplicably turned to ash and were brushed upwards by the breeze. That dusty tempest beat against my skin, sticking those specks of people tightly to my fearful, paralysed body\u2014a reminder of what I\u2019d done. A reminder of the evil coursing through my veins.\n\nSomething haunting that possessed me.\n\nI knew that I should keep moving. Should burn through my meagre funds, travelling as far as I could in any direction, so as to not be found again\u2014so as to become someone other than Charlie. Someone other than Adam: the harbinger of the apocalypse for whom the Old Collective was searching.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t have the stomach to truly leave it all behind.\n\nI wanted to go home.\n\nI felt alone and exposed. Felt stalked, as ever, by eyes only human on the surface.\n\nAt the age of twenty, having lived and studied as a university student for two years, I had long thought myself to be a grown-up. To be strong and independent. However, facing nightmares beyond myself had unveiled the truth\u2014that I was, beneath it all, still a child.\n\nAnd though I tried, I couldn\u2019t help myself. I reverted back to being a boy desperate for his mother and father.\n\nSo, I did exactly what the Old Collective expected of me. I took a flight home. And I was very nearly lulled into a false sense of security at Beauvais Airport\u2014by the crowds of everyday people, nattering and chattering about trivial things; but triviality was a coddling blanket, as it tricked me back into my old self\u2014the one who didn\u2019t believe in forces higher than ourselves. The one who believed only in the very grounded and very real world we all see with our eyes.\n\nIt must\u2019ve been a trauma response to the terrifying things I had seen and endured in Paris.\n\nBy the time I landed in Manchester, I was *blindly* eager to see my parents. All thought of danger had fled my mind. All I thought was that they must\u2019ve been worried sick about me for the past few days. That they may well have been home from the hospital already\u2014sitting at home, awaiting my return.\n\n*They didn\u2019t call*, I reminded myself.\n\nThat might\u2019ve been a cause for concern, had I been thinking clearly.\n\nBut when the nurses and doctors at the local hospital told me that no-one by the name of my father had been admitted within the past week, I felt a pang of fear. The mental alarm bells startled to toll quietly, clanging in a near-inaudible rhythm.\n\nStill, I tried my damnedest to ignore my mind, screaming at me to *RUN*, and decided, instead, to escalate the matter. I asked to talk to somebody about the ambulance service\u2019s records, as a vehicle had very clearly been dispatched to my street\u2014I\u2019d heard the siren as I fled. They found a record of my mother\u2019s 999 call. Found a member of staff who\u2019d been dispatched to the street. But\u2014\n\n\u201cNobody was there,\u201d the paramedic explained. \u201cWe knocked on the door, then tried to access the property, and finally called the fire department to assist. But when we searched your house, we found neither your mother nor father. They may well face legal action for the false call, so\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a false call,\u201d I interrupted breathlessly. \u201cThey should\u2019ve been there\u2026 They\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWeren\u2019t you with them?\u201d asked the paramedic.\n\nI gulped, then lied. \u201cI\u2026 went out to the shop when Mum called me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you waited two days to come to the hospital looking for your father?\u201d the paramedic asked, eyes narrowing suspiciously.\n\nI shook my head then started backing away, not looking to find myself in any sort of trouble\u2014for all I knew, eyes were watching me. The news of my parents\u2019 disappearance had woken up something in me. Had reminded me of the very present danger encroaching from all sides, suffocating me.\n\n\u201cI have to\u2026 find them,\u201d I hoarsely croaked, turning on my heel and quickly striding away before the paramedic could probe any deeper into the odd turn of events.\n\nI left the building, eyes stinging with a starting set of teardrops; I was moments away from bursting into full-blown bawling. But then I was overcome by a sudden sense of purpose\u2014a sudden idea, to be exact. The Old Collective had my parents, and I knew how to find them. But I would have to face one of my oldest fears.\n\nI took a long taxi ride to Cheshire, and was dropped off at Styal Prison. An ominous cluster of buildings, in the sense that they appeared more like haunted houses than the wards of a penitentiary. Red-bricked, two-storey buildings with stunted chimneys.\n\nOnly the sign gave away that I had stumbled not into a residential street but a prison:\n\n>***Welcome to HMP & YOI Styal***\n\n>Building Hope\n\n>Changing Lives\n\nAnd the inmate I had come to visit was, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve deduced, my old Religious Education teacher: Miss Black.\n\nThe woman who attempted to steal me from the world as a child.\n\n\u201cHas she had many visitors over the past six years?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d the officer bluntly replied.\n\nAnd that was the end of the conversation.\n\nThe prison officer led me down dimly-lit corridors in one of the smaller buildings. I looked out of the windows, but sunshine did nothing to cut through the gloom of the place.\n\nI had seen many friendly faces in the prison\u2014inmates and officers alike. But this particular man was the first who seemed cold and distant. I had the strangest feeling that it had something to do with the woman he was taking me to visit.\n\n\u201cMight I ask why we won\u2019t be talking in the visitor\u2019s centre?\u201d I asked politely as the man stopped in front of a particular door, shaky fingers around the door handle.\n\n\u201cWe bend the rules for her,\u201d he whispered, voice nearly cracking. \u201cIt\u2019s better for everyone when she stays in here.\u201d\n\nAs the prison officer unlocked the door, I turned a little pale and barked, \u201cWait!\u201d\n\nHe sighed and turned to face me. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d I started, shivering. \u201cI don\u2019t know about this.\u201d\n\nAnd the man simply nodded, as if fully understanding. \u201cDo you want me to lock this door? I should. I should lock it, then you should go home and never come back here.\u201d\n\nThe prison officer extended his free hand towards me, possibly to comfortingly pat me on the shoulder, but I retreated with wide, fearful eyes, remembering what had happened when Blueman\u2019s skin met mine. I had a horrifying flashback of his body overflowing with piping hot blood, moments before his flesh burst completely.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to risk touching another person again\u2014didn\u2019t want to risk even thinking of another person, as I\u2019d somehow fated the cultists to the same ends by merely letting our minds connect.\n\nI realised I had no control of the thing hiding within me.\n\nOr, perhaps more terribly, that thing had all of the control.\n\nI keep thinking that, perhaps, Adam has always been the real child. As far as I know, *I* am the being hitching a ride in a demonic creature.\n\nAnyhow, the prison officer seemed startled by my fearful, retreating reflex, but he quickly returned his hand to his side.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I whispered, infected by the man\u2019s contagious terror. \u201cWhy are you so afraid of her?\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cBecause bad things happen to people who so much as look at her. Things I don\u2019t know how to explain. Deaths, maims, and other nightmares that she couldn\u2019t have possibly have caused, but she is somehow always to blame\u2014we all feel it, so we all stay away from her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s happened time and time again to inmates and officers; they go back to their cells, or homes, then they suffer horrible fates. And it\u2019ll happen to you too, kid. So, I\u2019ll ask you one more time: do you want me to lock this door?\u201d\n\nI shook my head, and the officer offered me a pitying look, then a head nod. He flung the door open and stepped back, shakily motioning for me to step inside. He mumbled something about me hollering for him if necessary, but there was a pleading tone to his voice.\n\n*I beg of you, kid, don\u2019t holler for me; don\u2019t make me go in there with her.*\n\nMiss Black sat on the bottom bunk of her two-person room which, through a series of horrifying supernatural events, she had snagged for herself. Undoubtedly, given the prison officer\u2019s story, nobody would want to share a cell with such a haunting woman.\n\nThere was nothing comforting about seeing her with greying locks of hair, and tired eyes winged with crow\u2019s feet. Age had not weakened her in my eyes. If anything, it only afforded greater depths of wisdom and nightmarish power. Made her somehow less human in my eyes.\n\n\u201cAdam\u2026?\u201d Miss Black whispered, meeting my gaze with teary eyes and a jubilant smile. \u201cYou came back to me\u2026 To us\u2026 As foretold.\u201d\n\nI shuddered in horror at those two final words. I had come there of my own free will\u2014my own volition. I\u2019d been certain of that. But Miss Black made me doubt everything. Instilled me with dread greater than even that of my fourteen-year-old self. I felt lesser than I had on that day, with my schoolmates calling for Mr Alton to save me\u2014\n\nBecause I was alone this time.\n\n\u201cWhere are my parents?\u201d I wheezed.\n\n\u201cThe defectors?\u201d Miss Black asked. \u201cI have heard stories of them. Heard stories of you. When you were born, we travelled from far and wide, from all corners of the Earth, to see you. But I was not blessed to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d I begged. \u201cThey\u2019re gone, and I need them.\u201d\n\n\u201c*They abandoned you?*\u201d Miss Black hissed, brows suddenly lowering and gentle demeanour turning dark; it almost felt as if the sun had dimmed beyond her barred glass pane. \u201cThey defected from us. And they defected from you. They will pay when the crescent moon comes. When you rise to your fullest.\u201d\n\nMy lips quivered. \u201cPlease\u2026 You have to know something. Where are they?\u201d\n\nThe woman smiled. \u201cI am but one of many. Look at me, rotting away in this cage. The Old Ones have not come to collect me, have they? I don\u2019t know why you would imagine that I know a thing about your filthy abductors.\u201d\n\n\u201c*THEY\u2019RE MY PARENTS!*\u201d I screamed at the woman, fists clenching and eyes burning\u2014with neither tears, nor rage, but something I didn\u2019t understand.\n\nShe smiled widely, and I saw a glint of red in her eyes, but it didn\u2019t come from her.\n\nIt was a reflection of my *own* scorching pupils.\n\nI unclenched my fists and stumbled backwards, moaning in abject fear at whatever I\u2019d just experienced. Whatever I\u2019d felt burgeoning within me, threatening to bubble to the surface. I felt the red flit away from my retinas, but it was still there, lurking behind them\u2014lurking deep within me.\n\nAnd no matter how lovingly Miss Black looked at me, I knew that I wasn\u2019t the chosen one at all.\n\nI was a vessel for something deeper and darker that had been hibernating within me for twenty years.\n\nSomething on the verge of coming out.\n\nOf replacing me.\n\n\u201cYou are so nearly ready,\u201d she giggled tearfully.\n\nI gulped and turned. \u201cI\u2019m leaving now\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201c*WAIT!*\u201d she screeched, halting me in my tracks. \u201cI\u2019ll help you\u2026 I\u2019m connected to the Old Collective. I\u2019m sure they will know what happened to your\u2026 *mother and father*.\u201d\n\nThose last three words were practically spat out of Miss Black\u2019s mouth, as if they\u2019d tasted sour and poisonous on her tongue. I knew she was fooling me somehow. Knew that, given her desperation for me to stay, I should leave even more hurriedly\u2014should be doing whatever possible to not give her what she wanted.\n\nBut I needed Mum and Dad.\n\nI turned and nodded. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\nShe smiled. \u201cAs you will it, Adam. *Blessed be*.\u201d\n\nWhen she opened her mouth, I expected words to come out. Some ritualistic chanting in a foreign language. Something that would summon her fellow cultists to the prison. Instead, however, her mouth kept opening. Wider and wider, in both height and width.\n\nAnd my own lips could only open so far as I screamed at the impossibility before me.\n\nScreamed as her lips widened to fill the whole room.\n\nWidened and barrelled towards me.\n\nI banged feverishly on the door, shrieking at the top of my lungs for the prison officer to let me out. But either he\u2019d scarpered from the scene or Miss Black had already swept me away from that world.\n\nAnd then I fell into her blackened maw, shrieking until my vocal cords gave out.\n\nThen came blinding white from the black, and when I rubbed my eyes, my vision eventually adjusted to the blazing sun above. To the blue and yellow above\u2014to the green below. I felt grass scratching my skin and sat up, immediately feeling a lurch in my gut. I recognised that place.\n\nIt was the field from the photograph in my parents\u2019 attic.\n\n*I had returned home.*\n\nAnd not spiritually. Not in some vision that Miss Black had cast. She had, impossibly, flung my body from that cell in Styal Prison to a distant rural land. The land in which I had been born. The land to which pilgrims of the Old Collective had fled from across the world to see me. Their chosen one.\n\nTheir bringer of humanity\u2019s end.\n\n\u201c*CHARLIE!*\u201d screamed a voice from behind me.\n\nI shot to my feet and spun to see a horrifying sight.\n\nSwaying upside down from the upper beam of a wooden structure, shaped like a football goalpost, were my parents, bound by their ankles. And behind them, in a group of twenty or thirty, stood members of the Old Collective.\n\n\u201cHe has returned to us!\u201d cried a shrill voice from the crowd.\n\n\u201cYes. Sister Black shall be rewarded,\u201d came a deeper voice.\n\n\u201c*RUN, CHARLIE!*\u201d my mum begged a second time.\n\nShe was silenced by a swift thump to the head with one man\u2019s wooden stick.\n\n\u201cPlease!\u201d I begged, staggering forwards through the grass. \u201cJust let my parents go.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour parents?\u201d came a woman\u2019s voice from the crowd.\n\nAnd then they emerged. The blonde couple from the photo. Of course, twenty years later, their hair bore quite a few white strands, but they were unmistakeably the two who had been holding the baby in the picture.\n\nI felt sick.\n\n\u201cAdam,\u201d the man whispered. \u201cWe have spent two decades searching for you. Our boy. Blessed be.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlessed be,\u201d his wife blubbered.\n\nThe two walked, hand in hand, towards me, and I cast my eyes to my true parents, swinging upside down from the wooden beam\u2014not the ones who created me, but the ones who raised me. The ones who saved me from this nightmare.\n\n\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d I begged the blonde couple in fear, then I forced out the words, \u201cMum and Dad.\u201d\n\nI let them embrace me, as terrified as I felt. Their skin didn\u2019t crack, and blood didn\u2019t spill loose, which only filled me with hellish questions.\n\nWhy wasn\u2019t Blueman spared the same fate?\n\n*And what am I?*\n\n\u201cOur son,\u201d my biological father whispered into my fear as the pair squeezed me more tightly.\n\nI shivered, realising that our minds were connected. That he could read my every thought and desire.\n\nThat he knew I was lying.\n\nThat I didn\u2019t see them as Mother and Father.\n\nThat I didn\u2019t care about the Old Collective, and I\u2019d burn it all down to save my real parents.\n\nWhat horrified me above all else was that they didn\u2019t seem to care. Not a single member of that cult. This only made me fear that they, much like the nightmare dwelling within my body, held all of the cards\u2014held the true power in the scenario.\n\nAnd that I, Charlie, would die as soon as the time had come. As soon as I had become\u2014\n\n\u201c*Ripe*,\u201d my biological mother whispered tearfully in my other ear. \u201cYou are so nearly there, Adam.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Charlie\u2026\u201d I sniffled.\n\nAnd then their hands dug more deeply into my flesh.\n\nI tried to scream, but something held my tongue.\n\nThat thing within.\n\n\u201c*YOU ARE ADAM*,\u201d the blonde man hissed. \u201c*CHARLIE IS A LIE THAT WILL DIE UNDER THE CRESCENT MOON*.\u201d\n\n\u201cSoon, my darling,\u201d his wife whispered as the pair pulled away from me. \u201cBlessed be.\u201d\n\nThe man sighed, eyeing me softly again. \u201cBlessed be.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do I have to do to free them?\u201d I asked, watching my teary-eyed parents squirm in their restraints. \u201cWho is in charge?\u201d\n\nMy cult mother smiled. \u201cThe Crescent Moon.\u201d\n\nTo add emphasis to this answer, my cult father thrust his finger towards my chest, and I looked down, feeling a jolt course across my skin and through my core. I felt it behind my ribcage. The irregularity. The *dum, ba-ba-dum, dum, ba-ba-dum*\u2014like the beat of a drum, not a heart. We are not built to be conscious of own organs. Our own innards. But my biological father had made me, with the touch of his finger, so horribly, horribly aware of my inner cogs.\n\n*Of my crescent-shaped heart.*\n\nThere came chest pain, and I looked down to see something pressing through my chest\u2014pressing through the fabric of my shirt.\n\nA half-moon outline.\n\nI fell to my knees in the grass, hyperventilating as I realised that the members of the Old Collective weren\u2019t waiting for a crescent moon in the sky.\n\nThe Crescent Moon was me.\n\nThe heart within me.\n\nThe living thing waiting to awaken.\n\n*Waiting to ripen.*\n\n\u201cCharlie is a lie,\u201d the blonde man reiterated more softly. \u201cYou will come to understand that, Adam, when you, like the rest of us, bow to the Crescent Moon. But we must help you along, boy, for you have been led astray for too many years by these blasphemers.\u201d\n\nMy biological father took a few purposeful strides towards my mother and father swaying in the air.\n\n\u201cGo to hell,\u201d my true dad growled.\n\nThe blonde man chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ll show you the afterlife of the one true religion, sinner.\u201d\n\nMy biological mother offered me what almost appeared to be empathy. \u201cWe are sorry for this, Adam.\u201d\n\nThen the cultist, in one swift motion, drew a blade from his belt and ran it across my father\u2019s throat.\n\nMy mother and I screamed in unison as a river of red ran out of the wound, spilling over my father\u2019s spluttering mouth.\n\nA moment later, the cultist ran that same blade through the flesh of my mother\u2019s throat.\n\nI wailed in agony, watching my true parents wriggle in the restraints as the blood drained from their still-alive bodies. But it didn\u2019t take long for my father to stop moving. And my mother, desperately trying to mouth some words to me with her dying lips, eventually hung still too.\n\n\u201cAnd now,\u201d my biological father announced, turning to face me. \u201cIt is time to drain you, Adam.\u201d\n\nAs the man walked towards me, wielding that blood-stained blade, I felt fear grip every inch of my body. Fear beyond anything primal. Fear existential, as I questioned what would become of me after my throat had been slit and my body had been exsanguinated.\n\n*Would my body rise again as something else?*\n\nI clutched my temples and closed my eyes, trying to ignore the fear in my heart as the man\u2019s feet squelched against the grass and my horrifying end approached.\n\nAnd then I saw them in my mind\u2019s eye.\n\nThe faces of the cultists standing in that field, watching me from the execution site.\n\nWatching my father walk towards me.\n\nWithin my mind, I reached out and touched them all.\n\nIt was an act of self-defence, and rage, and sorrow. I kept my eyes closed as the screaming started, but I saw the horror behind closed eyes. Saw it through our accursed spiritual connection. The cracking skin fissures, letting blood run free, then the shattering of the bodies one by one.\n\nOnly my biological mother and father remained, lying in the grass, when I opened my eyes.\n\nI towered over them, resisting the urge to let that hate flare in my pupils\u2014the redness that I\u2019d seen reflected in Miss Black\u2019s own eyes. But it was too late. As my blonde parents clung to their last moments of life, skin cracking and steaming blood spilling free, they both smiled at me.\n\n\u201cBlessed be,\u201d croaked my mother. \u201cWith this act, you have\u2026 prepared yourself for the harvest.\u201d\n\nShe shattered, and my father didn\u2019t even flinch\u2014didn\u2019t let their smile waver for a second.\n\n\u201cRipe,\u201d he croaked as his very lips began to fragment, and his body began to fall apart. \u201c*One more time, Adam*.\u201d\n\nAnd then I was left standing again in an empty field, accompanied only by a gust of ash in the air and my true parents\u2019 pale corpses hanging from a wooden beam.\n\nBut the true horror survived within my chest\u2014that crescent-shaped abomination, with a life of its own, threatening to break free.\n\nThreatening, next time, to connect with every last person on Earth, turning them all to ash and leaving me as the last thing alive.\n\n*One more time, Adam.*\n\nI understand now. With every tap into that thing within me, I have made it stronger. Have brought it closer to fully taking the reins. Mum and Dad were shielding me from myself, hoping I would never unlock that part of me. That I would never become what the Old Collective had *made* me to be.\n\nI don\u2019t know how they woke up. Became human again and left the Old Collective behind, taking me with them. But I have to believe that the same can be achieved by others across the world, for they are many. So, so many. And that terrifies me.\n\nPlease, I beg of any members reading this, see sense. Stop this nightmare.\n\nDon\u2019t let that thing take me.\n\nNobody will [survive](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/dominiceagle)."},"70":{"title":"The Invitation","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kgbzso\/the_invitation\/","flair":null,"author":"Im_yor_boi","selftext":"In the days following marriage, there was a weird sort of hold that tradition had on us. Custom dominated sense, and culture preceded reason. One of those traditions was that the bride had to be fetched to the groom's village at midnight\u2014always midnight. Folks said it was to guard her modesty, to make sure no stranger saw her face before she moved into her new home. But I always figured it was a matter of fear\u2014superstition masquerading as ritual. No one challenged it. No one dared.\n\nThat night, as with so many nights before me, I was one of the men who were called to escort the bride. I was not her brother, but I was a cousin\u2014close enough by blood to accept the honor and heavy enough with obligation to not refuse. Two of us walked behind the bullock cart, sticks in hand, keeping watch under the moon. The cart creaked like an old bone with every turn of the wheel. The bride was concealed inside, wrapped in silence, shrouded behind folds of cloth and tradition.\n\nThe village was hours away from here, and the road twisted through empty fields and dense, whispering forests. The air was chill but had a stillness that made even the insects reluctant. All that could be heard was the gentle crunch of our footsteps on the ground, the oxen's sigh, and occasionally the ghostly hoot of an owl in the distance.\n\nAs we strolled past a small pond\u2014a dark sheet of still water under the stars\u2014I saw something scurrying around its rim. I looked into the blackness. It had looked like a fox, a thin and small one, its nose twitching as it dug in the rubbish left by travelers. Maybe it was its wild movements that caught my eye. Maybe it was the way it stared at me when it saw me looking.\n\nHalf-jestingly, I said, \"Why look there when you can ride with us? We have plenty to fill you up for days in our village.\" I laughed softly to myself. My partner shot me a sidelong look but remained silent. At the time, I felt strangely proud of my joke, as though I had uttered something witty into the darkness.\n\nWe proceeded further.\n\nBut the night wasn't forgetful.\n\nTen minutes or so after that, I heard the faintest noise behind us\u2014a shuffle or a dragging foot. I turned, and there it was. The fox. Only. it wasn't quite the same. It was bigger now, its fur wet or perhaps gone in patches. It trailed behind at a distance, keeping just far enough back to be just on the edge of sight in the dark.\n\nI laughed nervously and thumped my stick on the ground. \"Shoo! Go eat somewhere else,\" I said, trying to be bolder than I felt. The creature hesitated, tilted its head\u2014but didn't flee.\n\nMy cousin turned around and saw it too. \"Foxes don't follow people like that,\" he complained.\n\nMaybe it's sick,\" I replied, \"I don't believe it.\".\n\nI kept looking over my shoulder more than I looked where I was going. The beast trailed behind, steady and slow, as if it were somehow held to us. Each time I glanced back at it, it looked less fox. Its gait was unnatural\u2014too smooth, too silent. Its eyes had lost that animal glint and now simply reflected nothing. No fear. No curiosity. Nothing.\n\nThen came the moment that changed everything.\n\nI turned once again, and what I saw rooted me to the ground.\n\nIt was not a fox. It was not even a beast. It was on four legs, but its body was naked\u2014smooth and long. Holes pockmarked its skin, as if decay had taken hold years ago, but it still had a purposeful movement. It was the length of a calf, contorted and curved in shape, but appallingly alive. It looked at me as if it had heard the joke I had told and had accepted the invitation.\n\nI remained there. My heart was beating so fast that I was afraid to wake the bride. My cousin bent forward and whispered, \"What\u2026 what is that?\" but I couldn't answer.\n\nI knew\u2014in my very bones\u2014that we could not bring it into the village.\n\nSo I did the best I could think to do. I approached it slowly on foot, shaking with every step. I placed my stick in front of me as a sign of surrender, then went down on my knees.\n\n\"Please,\" I whispered. \"I've done something wrong. There is nothing there for you where we're going. I've made a false statement. Don't follow us, please.\"\n\nThe creature didn't move. It stared at me, empty eyes unblinking. For a moment, I was convinced it was about to pounce. But then, with a slight shift of its odd head\u2014or perhaps a readjustment of its odd body\u2014it wheeled westward and left. No noise. No sign. Silent and away.\n\nIt disappeared into the darkness, consumed by the night.\n\nI just stood there for what seemed like forever before I could walk again. My cousin and I never said a word to one another as we walked. We did not even glance to see if the beast would return. We did not care.\n\nOne week later, word came from the west.\n\nVillage after village\u2014sick. People dying in scores. Some said it was malaria. Others said it was a curse. I remembered the holes on that creature's skin, the way it walked, the silence it carried with it. I remembered what I had said, what I had invited.\n\n\"Was it me?\" I kept asking myself, over and over. \"Did I unleash something?\"\n\nThe shame clung to me like dust, heavy and smothering. I starved for days. I could not sleep without seeing its face\u2014or what amounted to one. Each evening, I caught myself gazing out to the west, half-hoping to see its shape materialize on the horizon, coming back to claim the rest of what I had vowed.\n\nYears went by, but the sensation never faded. The bride and groom went on with their lives, and other people quickly forgot that evening. But I did not. I could not. Certain errors diminish with the passing of time, but some cast a shadow. I had laughed in the darkness, and something had listened. Something that did not laugh.\n\nAnd now, even years later, I find myself wondering. Was that thing the disease carrier? A ghost? A demon? Or was it something created by guilt, born from a coincidence so terrible it could not be overlooked? I don't know. All I know is this: some invitations are not meant to be spoken. And if they've done so, they cannot be taken back anymore."},"71":{"title":"I Work At A State Park and None of Us Know What's Going On: Part 7","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kghyj7\/i_work_at_a_state_park_and_none_of_us_know_whats\/","flair":"Series","author":"Agreeable-Ease1664","selftext":"Part 6: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/deepnightsociety\/s\/Mih3KxKUHs \n\nThings are really ramping up here at Richard L. Hornberry State Park. The weather is getting warmer and that means people want to get outside more. That\u2019s one of the great things about RLHSP, it\u2019s outside. The park gets busier by the day. In the off season we run anywhere from seven to zero people a day entering the park. Once the weather warms up though we might get anywhere between fifty and a hundred people in the park in a single day. During the Summer months it's not uncommon to get even two hundred people here. \n\nI always get a little nervous this time of year. More people in the park means that there are more chances for something bad to happen. On top of your typical outdoor hazards, falling rocks, steep ravines, deep waters, snakes, bees, etc, we have a whole host of other, not so natural, hazards that our park visitors might face. \n\nThankfully Ricky, the plesiosaur that lives in the lake, is a little bit shy, and he doesn\u2019t make too many appearances. I myself have only seen the beast once. But of course there is the squirrel pile, which is unavoidable, but tends to get larger this time of year; more foot traffic seems to stir the squirrels up and they jump off of that cliff in greater numbers. That always seems to freak everyone out. Sometimes we have to clean up the pile everyday this time of year, normally that is only a once a week kind of job. \n\nThings like the Squirrel Pile aren\u2019t really harmful though, unless someone just so happens to be standing right under the exact spot where the squirrels jump from, in which case there might be some problems. But generally speaking that doesn\u2019t happen, at least not that I have heard of. Really it\u2019s the unpredictable things, those strange anomalies that just kind of happen, without any warning, those are the things I worry about. The Pines area in the North with its expanding and contracting trails kind of worries me. People can be lost for days or weeks without even knowing it. Sometimes those weird time dilations happen outside of the Pines too. Then of course there\u2019s this giant tentacled thing in the lake. It has already caused us some serious issues during the off season. Now that the park is getting busier I worry that we will see an influx of problems involving that slimy suction cupped creep. The worst part of it is that none of us that work here have ever really even seen the thing. I think the only good look at it that any of us has gotten was a few months back when it took out that fishing boat and Phil sent me to get the harpoon. I only saw a tentacle, Phil said he saw at least four tentacles. If anyone has seen more of it they have either kept their mouth shut about it or they didn\u2019t live long enough to tell anyone. \n\nSince we\u2019ve been getting more folks coming in and we expect the numbers to keep growing we don\u2019t really get to move at our normal leisurely pace around the park anymore. We\u2019re real busy here cleaning up picnic areas and campsites, cleaning debris off of trails, and getting all of the \u201cABSOLUTELY NO HIKING BEYOND THIS POINT\u201d signs up in the appropriate places. Also, due to the last two encounters there Phil has, rather intelligently might I add, decided to close off the Rosemary Mine for the season. The Screams are just too frequent anymore and I\u2019m not sure Jordan has really gotten over his encounter with\u2026whatever it was down there. Not to mention that ghost boy that led me on that wild goose chase. \n\nA few days ago I took one of the park's boats out on the lake, to do a sort of rough inventory of the amount of fish we had in the lake. The boat was equipped with all of the typical boating equipment; extra paddles, gas for the motor, life jackets, fish finder, harpoon, dynamite. The fish finder comes in handy for more than just fish finding. Say for instance we\u2019ve got a report of someone missing on the lake. That fish scanner is remarkably good at detecting bodies. Thankfully none of us park staff ever have to fish anyone up off of the bottom of the lake. These men in suits come out and take care of that. That\u2019s only happened twice since I\u2019ve been here though. Thank God.\n\nThat particular day though I was out scanning, looking at all the fish that we had on that little finder screen, when, while on the North side of the lake, I heard someone calling my name. I didn\u2019t recognize the voice at first, but as I moved closer to the shore I saw that it was Ellen. She was standing beneath a Pine tree right at the shoreline waving to me. I pulled the boat up close and tried to talk to her. She had this big stupid smile on her face and I thought maybe the crows had said something funny to her and she wanted to let me in on the joke. \n\n\u201cHey James,\u201d she said as I pulled up, still smiling ear to ear.\n\n\u201cHey Ellen. Something funny?\u201d I said, beginning to smile myself.\n\n\u201cNope! Just happy to see you!\u201d She replied.\n\n\u201cWell then, care to join me? I\u2019m checking the fish population right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to!\u201d She said nearly jumping up and down with excitement.\n\nSure I thought it was odd, Ellen is never this interested in me, but part of me thought that my unparalleled charm had finally started to get to her. She climbed in the boat and sat in the passenger seat. I took off again and began checking that scanner looking at all the little red blobs that are supposedly fish. \n\nThen the whole screen went red. I thought maybe it had broken or something. Ellen said something under her breath. I\u2019m not sure what it was, she wasn\u2019t even looking at the screen. It didn\u2019t quite sound like English but I didn\u2019t ask. The screen was red for quite a while. We had made it a little closer to the West shore of the lake before anything happened, the giant red spot had finally gone away, and then it happened.\n\nA gigantic tentacle shot out of the water and towered, what I figured to be, about twenty feet above us. It lingered there, sticking out of the lake like a blasphemous tower, and then, and very suddenly, it came down. It narrowly missed the boat but the resulting tidal wave flipped us sideways and sent the boat down to Hornberry\u2019s Locker. Ellen and I began to swim frantically for the shore. If that thing, that tentacled beast, really wanted to, it could have drug us under. I think it was playing with us, or maybe it just doesn\u2019t like boats. I\u2019m not terribly sure, and if my training at RLHSP has taught me anything at all, it\u2019s that I shouldn\u2019t think about it too long. \n\nNevertheless, Ellen and I made it to shore safe and sound. When at last I had caught my breath I stood and watched the boat's propeller sink beneath the waves, buried in a dirge of bubbles.\n\n\u201cHey, my cabin\u2019s not too far from here, let\u2019s get up there and get dry huh?\u201d I said to Ellen, who herself was just standing there, staring out at the lake. Her smile had now settled into a blank emotionless expression. \n\n\u201cYes, sounds good.\u201d She said dryly, even though I watched her face contort into an awkward smile once again. \n\nSo we hiked up the short hill which led to an old service road that eventually winds its way down to my cabin. Ellen didn\u2019t talk the whole way there, even though I tried to start a conversation. I tried a few times actually, but nothing got through. \n\nWe got to my cabin and I pointed her towards the bathroom and told her that she could get dried off first. \n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d was her emotionless reply, though she still had that freaky smile on her face. \n\nWhen she finally stepped out of the bathroom she seemed normal again. Her smile felt more genuine and she stopped with the dry or overly enthusiastic answers. Feeling comfortable once again I thought I\u2019d try to lay the charm down thick. \n\n\u201cYou like popcorn?\u201d I said suavely. \n\n\u201cOh I love it!\u201d She replied.\n\nSo I put a couple bags of corn in the microwave and waited for them to pop. While waiting I walked over to my tv and looked for a movie to put on. I settled on Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The one from the 50s. I love old sci fi horror movies. \n\nWith corn popped and the invasion starting, Ellen and I sat down on my couch to enjoy the evening. I must say I was rather surprised at just how flirty she was being. She plopped down right next to me, and over the course of the movie slowly maneuvered her way under my right arm. I was so excited and nervous that I completely ignored the fact that this was a major warning sign. Ellen is never like this, and definitley not with me. \n\nThe next thing I knew I was woken up by the sound of my cabin door slamming into the inside wall. I didn\u2019t even realize I was asleep. Invasion of the Body Snatcher\u2019s was nearly over and I could see by the window that it was dark outside. Ellen was asleep now too, head on my chest. All of this I took in in that brief flash of a second when I spun my head to see who had just barged into my cabin. To my utter horror, it was Ellen. \n\nI looked at her standing at the door, covered in rain drops. Of course it was raining again, seems to rain a lot here at Richard L. Hornberry State Park. She had a gun drawn and was breathing heavily. Then I looked down at her asleep on my chest.\n\nI gave Ellen, the one standing at the door, a horrified look, but I still attempted some kind of communication. \n\nThe woman standing at the door was undoubtedly Ellen. When I looked at her it was obvious. It was like the woman I'd been hanging out with all day just hadn't been quite right, and now, when I saw the real thing, it all clicked. The Ellen on my couch, her face, her mannerisms, they weren't right, they hadn't been right all day. The stupid smile, that emotionless stare. It all made sense. But now that the horror of my situation had been fully revealed to me, I didn't know what to do. If I moved, the thing on my couch, that looked like Ellen, might wake up. \n\nThe real Ellen crept over to the back of the couch. She held a finger over her lips. Then, very quickly she grabbed the fake her by the hair, I moved my arm, she pulled the imposter across the couch. I shot up out of my seat and watched as the real Ellen put a pillow over the fake Ellen's face, cocked her gun, and then shot her.\n\nThe thing thrashed and flailed for a while. All the time letting out this inhuman, I dare say otherworldly scream, and then it was silent. The silence slowly engulfed the room and I could now hear the pitter patter of rain on the roof of my cabin. \n\nNow that it was at last safe to speak Ellen and I looked at each other. I'm normally pretty tongue tied around her, but this time I honestly could not think of what to say. \n\n\u201cUh\u2026.\u201d I got out at last.\n\n\u201cYeah, tell me about it.\u201d Ellen said.\n\n\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cThat thing, that thing with my face, there's several of them, or well\u2026there were several of them. Not all with my face of course. There was one for all of us. That was the last one though. I've been dispatching them all day.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, but, how did you\u2026uh\u2026how did you figure that out?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cBecause you called me this afternoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? I didn't call you. I don't even have your number!\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly!\u201d \n\n\u201cI'm not following though, how did that tip you off to all of this?\u201d \n\n\u201cWell I'm sitting at home right? Cause you know, everyone got a week off. I'm sitting there watching a movie, when I get a call, unknown number, and when I answer, it's you. You wanted me to come down to the park and help you with something. I just mentioned to you that it was my week off and I'd deal with it when I came back to work. Then I paused for a moment and asked how you got my number. You said that I had given it to you. But I never have given you my number. I knew something was off so I drove up here. I got here just in time to see you take off on the boat out into the lake. But like ten minutes later you came walking up to me in the parking lot by the lodge. But my God, it wasn't you. It wasn't right. You had such a stupid smile on your face, and you didn't stutter even once. I asked you a few other telling personal questions, you failed that test. So...I shot you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about all the other ones?\u201d I asked her.\n\n\u201cYes, okay, so there was a Richard, an Aaron, and a Jordan. They've all got the week off too so I knew it wasn't really them. I really don't know what they are, but I knew there had to be a clone of all of us. Didn't see a Phil though. Doesn't matter, I've been hunting myself all night. I had a suspicion, so I came up here.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh my God. That's just, I don't even know.\u201d I stammered out.\n\n\u201cYeah well, thanks to me, \u2018I\u2019 didn't kill you in your sleep.\u201d \n\n\u201cYeah, thanks for that,\u201d I stood scratching my head staring at the bloodless body on the floor. As I watched it it shriveled into an Ellen raisin, and then it just kind of evaporated. \n\n\u201cThey all did that.\u201d Ellen said as though it was completely normal. \n\nI began to wonder how this little episode might affect my relationship with my coworker. Not to mention how Ellen might feel seeing everyone back at work in a few days. I mean, she had just shot all of them.\n\nEllen was gracious enough not to mention that I had just been on a quasi date with her doppelganger. \n\n\u201cSo,\u201d I began. \u201cWould you like some popcorn?\u201d\n\n\u201cHah! Yeah right. I would like some sleep.\u201d Ellen proceeded to lay down on my couch and was asleep almost as soon as her head touched the arm rest. \n\nNeedless to say I didn't sleep a wink that night. Trust me after a few years working at this place, it takes a lot to keep me from falling asleep. I spent most of the night sitting up in my bed, pistol in hand, staring at the back of my couch. Two doppelgangers of the same person would be ridiculous. But at RLHSP, nothing is impossible. We outta make that a slogan. \n\nIt wasn't another doppelganger though. Ellen woke up around 7 in the morning.\n\n\u201cOh God, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to sleep here all night.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt's no problem,\" I said, looking back at her with what I was sure were bloodshot and heavily bagged eyes.\n\nShe sleepily left my cabin and as soon as she closed the door behind her I collapsed into the warm embrace of sleep. \n\nI woke up the following day to Phil knocking at my door.\n\n\u201cWhere on Earth have you been kid?\u201d I could hear him yelling from the other side of the door. \n\n\u201cRight here old timer!\u201d I yelled back.\n\nRight here, at Richard L. Hornberry State Park. Where nothing is impossible.\n\nWe hope you'll come and visit sometime\n\nUntil then,\n\nJames\n"},"72":{"title":"Judgment Day","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kg2bc4\/judgment_day\/","flair":null,"author":"Writerwithoutsoul","selftext":"I\u2019m a defense attorney, but this story isn\u2019t about my job. It\u2019s about the day my client Christina completely butchered her carefully-drafted defense by stabbing me in the stomach.\n\nAs I desperately tried to keep my intestines inside, I wished good luck onto my predecessor. Getting Chris out of this one would be pretty damn hard. Even though, I thought, it wasn\u2019t \u00a0*technically* sufficient evidence. Just cause Christina had stabbed me didn\u2019t *necessarily* mean she had stabbed all those others as well.\n\nThen, my world got dark.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe next thing I remember is my feet feeling soft. Very soft. I was standing on a cloud. Weird. I stared at my hands. They were clean. No guts. The world was bright. And there were people in front of me. And behind me. I was in some kind of line. As it moved forward, I figured out three things: \n\n1. I was probably dead. \n\n2. I was in line to get into heaven. \n\n3. While everyone else was wearing some type of nightgown, I was still in my pantsuit.\n\nAs I got closer and closer to the pearly gates, more and more wrinkles appeared on the face of the angel guarding them. When the girl in front of me stepped up to him, he only took one single look at her, his expression full of disdain.\n\n\u201cHell.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait\u201d, the girl shook her head, \u201cwait, wait, wait. I didn\u2019t mean to kill them.\u201d\n\nI frowned. Something about that voice seemed familiar.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just get so angry sometimes. But I\u2026 I wanted to be better. I swear. And I\u2026\u201d\n\nI took a step forward. \u201cChristina?\u201d\n\nThe angel looked up. The disdain on his face turned into annoyance. \u201cOh Lord, why are *you* here? Your time hasn\u2019t come yet.\u201d\n\nI clicked my tongue. \u201cWell, that\u2019s unfortunate. But if you\u2019ll excuse us, I\u2019d like to talk with my client for a moment?\u201d\n\nHe grumbled something incomprehensible.\n\nChristina and I stepped aside. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d, I asked, \u201cthis doesn\u2019t add up. I died before you. Did you push past me in line or something?\u201d, I tilted my head, \u201calso, uhm, why did you stab me?\u201d\n\nChristina didn\u2019t look at me. \u201cSorry\u201d, she whispered, \u201cI couldn\u2019t face you. Sometimes, I just see red\u201d, she took a deep breath, \u201cBut now that\u2019s okay. Now, the police shot me and I get what I deserve\u201d, she raised her voice, preparing herself to step forward. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait\u201d, I pushed her behind me, \u201cwait, stop. She doesn\u2019t deserve eternal damnation. Listen. One of the main ideas behind our justice system is rehabilitation. My client clearly regrets what she did, and she wants to do better. Don\u2019t you have like a heaven-equivalent to prison? Community service? Purgatory?\u201d\n\nThe angel blinked. \u201cThis is none of your business.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is, literally\u201d, I crossed my arms, \u201cthis woman is my client.\u201d\n\nThe angel closed his eyes. \u201cDefense attorney, right. I really hate you guys.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t everyone deserve justice?\u201d, I asked, \u201cjust as the Lord gives it to us?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou try to be like the Lord?\u201d\n\nI suddenly remembered that the angel was gonna judge *me* next. I forced myself to lower my gaze. \u201cI just try to be kind. To be fair. To be a good person.\u201d\n\nHe smiled at me. I suppressed a shudder. I hadn\u2019t thought that it was possible for an angel to smile so sinisterly. It took all my strength not to jerk back.\n\n\u201cDo you wish to take on a second job here?\u201d, the angel asked, \u201cyour time hasn\u2019t come. You will return back to earth soon. But if you want, you can visit us at night. You can do what you do best: Defend. What do you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026 uhm\u201d, I trailed off. Honestly, I didn\u2019t really have the capacity to take on a night-job. Also, I was a lawyer. I  had a talent for smelling bullshit. And by the way the angel spoke\u2026 if I said yes, I wasn\u2019t gonna get a salary. On the contrary, agreeing was gonna cost me. I didn\u2019t know what. But it was gonna cost me.\n\nThe angel tilted his head. \u201cEveryone deserves an attorney, right?\u201d\n\nI swallowed. \u201cRight.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood\u201d, he made a little note in his book, \u201cthen go ahead. Defend her. But be aware, she isn\u2019t going to hell for the murders. She has confessed and regretted those.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor what then?\u201d, I asked.\n\n\u201cAdultery.\u201d\n\nChristina waved. \u201cWe were only married on paper by then.\u201d\n\n\u201cDivorce.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u201cBut I don\u2019t regret that\u201d, Christina said, \u201chow could I? I was a danger for him. I loved him enough to let him go.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could have worked on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI tried, I\u2026\u201d\n\n*\u201cHell.\u201d*\n\n\u201cExcuse me\u201d, I said, \u201cmy client has acted in the best interests of her ex-husband. Her noble motives should be taken into consideration when\u2026\u201d, I stopped mid-sentence. A terrible feeling crept up inside of me. Suddenly, I couldn\u2019t move. Couldn\u2019t breathe. Couldn\u2019t do anything except writhe in agony as I saw the demons appeared. \u00a0So I just watched them drag Christina to hell.\n\n\u201cNext\u201d, the angel said.\n\n\u201cWait, you can\u2019t\u2026\u201d, I stuttered, \u201cStop. Bring her back. I didn\u2019t have time to\u2026 I couldn\u2019t even defend her. You *have* to let me defend her.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said next!\u201d\n\nThe next woman walked up, a lovely lady with a huge sunburn.\n\n\u201cDid I die from gardening?\u201d, she asked, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, that can\u2019t be right. I know I sometimes forget to wear a hat, and my son *has* said it will be the end of me, but\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cHell\u201d, the angel interrupted, \u201clesbian.\u201d\n\n\u201cObjection!\u201d, I yelled, \u201cI\u2026 uh\u2026 she\u2026 I\u201d, I felt my breath hitch and forced myself to swallow, \u201cwell. Your honor. First of all, this woman didn\u2019t hurt a soul.\u201d\n\nThe angel shrugged. \u201cShe is a woman who lay with another woman. Hell.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo why\u00a0*the fuck*\u00a0did you make her that way?\u201d, I took a deep breath. Swearing probably wasn\u2019t the best strategy. \u201cHow could her love be something sinful when it resulted in a beautiful, god-fearing, loving family? When it resulted in charity, in children, in a garden she grew?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe sinned, and she never regretted it. *Hell*.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d, I stared at him \u201cyou can\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\nI froze. There was that feeling again. That terrible, helpless feeling. I cried softly as they dragged the woman down to eternal damnation. \u201cThank you for trying\u201d, she whispered.\n\nI stared at the place where she disappeared. I had failed her. I had failed my clients. I clenched my fists. Focus. Be what the angel hired you for. A defense attorney. Professional. Argumentative. Good under pressure. I felt myself calm down. I had trained for this.\n\nA tug at my sleeve. A young girl, almost a child. \u201cCan you help me?\u201d, she asked, \u201cI\u2019m scared to talk to the angel because I made my baby go away. Do you think he will be mad at me?\u201d\n\nTears were flooding down my cheek. I wondered if that meant rain on earth.\n\nI couldn\u2019t stop the crying, but I could still use my voice. So, I cleared my throat, re-arranged my blazer. Made sure my hair was in order. And smiled.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s find out, sweetie.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re awake!\u201d\n\nA happy voice. The first happy voice in a long, long time.\n\nI was still crying. But now, someone was stroking my face, wiping the tears away. I recognized the smell of my partner. I opened my eyes and then, she was crying too.\n\n\u201cHow long was I out?\u201d, I asked.\n\n\u201cAbout three days\u201d, she forced herself to smile, \u201cwas it a relaxing coma? The first time in a while you got that much sleep, huh?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was terrible\u201d, I said, \u201cI had the weirdest nightmare.\u201d Three days. Three days and hundreds of cases. I had lost all of them. Except\u2026 wait. I still had one real client. \n\n\u201cWhat about Christina?\u201d, I asked, \u201chow is she doing?\u201d\n\nMy wife bit her lip. \u201cHoney, I uhm\u2026 I don\u2019t know how\u2026 well\u2026 oh screw it. That bitch tried to stab you, so I\u2019m just gonna say it. Christina is dead. The police shot her.\u201d\n\nI closed my eyes. It didn't stop the images. Hundreds of faces. Hundreds of women I hadn\u2019t saved. Christina had been real. They had all been real.\n\n\u201cYou know, her ex-husband picked up her remains\u201d, my wife cleared her throat, \u201che said\u2026 he said he was sure Christina was sorry for stabbing you. She just got angry like that, sometimes.\u201d\n\nThe beeping of monitors grew louder around me. Doctors and nurses rushed in. Everyone was freaking out, thinking I was gonna die\u2026 again. Like Christina. Christina was dead. Shot by police. Pretty damning evidence for once.\n\nI forced myself to open my eyes again, to look at the one face that wasn\u2019t dead, though it was just as damned as the others. My wife. There were lines in that face, lines from age and laughter. I touched her cheek, and my heartbeat calmed down.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay love\u201d, she said, \u201cit\u2019s okay. Christina is in a better place now.\u201d\n\nI forced myself to smile. \u201cLet\u2019s go home soon, yeah?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt actually took a few weeks until they released me. The experience gave me a huge scar on my stomach and a new job.\n\nNow, I\u2019m a defense attorney at night as well. I have lines on my face now, too, lines of anger and pain. I wake up crying every morning. I try my best to prepare myself in the evenings. To be a professional, to guarantee a fair trial. But how can you win a fight when the laws weren't written for you? So far, I have lost 231118 cases. Divorces. Escaping abusive relationships. Adultery. Abortions. All while men who have done unspeakable things sneaked right past the gate, simply by claiming they regret it. I know that when my time comes, the demons will drag me down as well. I will suffer alongside all the people I have failed.\n\nBut every morning, right before I head out to work, I kiss my wife goodbye. And I cannot help it.\n\nI cannot regret loving her."},"73":{"title":"Two weeks ago, a family disappeared while hiking\u2026 I hope they\u2019re never found again","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kfnc5x\/two_weeks_ago_a_family_disappeared_while_hiking_i\/","flair":null,"author":"lets-split-up","selftext":"We never expected to find them\u2014the family that went missing. The trails had all been combed over the past week and a half. And we were, after all, not experienced hikers ourselves. My sibling Ace and I had never really roughed it, never detoured from established trails. At least, not intentionally.\n\nSomewhere in the pines the official trail markings vanished. Our phones lost all signal, and the narrow track we followed wound upwards along the steady slope through the trees before finally petering out into nothing.\n\nWe were about to turn back when we spotted, just ahead, a clear, smooth patch of land with the remnants of a stone circle for a campfire and some discarded soda cans. Ace grumbled and went to collect the cans\u2014only to call out to me when they found a bright pink backpack. Inside was a notebook, a crumpled paper lunch bag, and a sloth plushie.\n\n\u201cFound a snack for you.\u201d Ace tossed me the lunch bag.\n\n\u201cDude! That is foul!\u201d Catching the bag, I caught a whiff of the rot inside\u2014remnants of a sandwich, now stale and furry, and a mushy apple. I plucked out the mushy apple and flung it at my older sibling, who swore and ducked. Then together, we both examined the backpack.\n\nThe same thought must have crossed both our minds then\u2014what if the backpack belonged to the family that went missing? We\u2019d strayed off the path. What if this was the same way they came, only they got lost and never found their way back?\n\nAccording to the news, the family\u2014parents Patty and Joel, their daughter Emily, and Patty\u2019s brother Mike\u2014all went missing during what was meant to be an overnight backpacking trip. Witnesses saw them park their car at the trailhead and hike into the crisscrossing, well-worn trails of the pines.\n\nThat was over a week ago.\n\nNow, I squeezed the sloth plushie, its fur matted from being cuddled so long\u2014could this have been the daughter\u2019s? Ace flipped through the notebook, showed me a long-haired stick-figure sketch of \u201csmelly Uncle Mike.\u201d We both smirked, but stopped smiling when flipping to the inside cover revealed a scrawled name: \u201cEmily B.\u201d\n\n\u201cEmily and her uncle, Mike. Those were the names, right?\u201d I said, chilled.\n\n\u201cShit\u2026 yeah.\u201d Ace turned to eye the woods around us. \u201cWe need to let the authorities know.\u201d\n\nThe afternoon sunlight slanted down on us. There were no other traces of the family around the campsite. They\u2019d clearly packed up and trekked on from here\u2014but which direction? I scoped out the woods, wandering further out. Something pink fluttered in the distance\u2014\n\n\u201cRowan! Don\u2019t get lost!\u201d Ace called.\n\nI clambered up through the bramble and over dead leaves and snatched up the pink fabric, caught on a fallen trunk. \u201cIt\u2019s a girl\u2019s sweater!\u201d I hollered. Nearby, a trail wound up the slope.\n\nAce\u2019s lanky figure remained rooted far below for several moments. Then, they riffled in their bag, and wrapped some blue tape around a branch by the campsite. They disappeared further downwards\u2014probably to mark where the trail we\u2019d been following petered out. Finally, they clambered up to me. I stood waving the pink fabric impatiently.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go running off\u2014\u201d began Ace.\n\n\u201cLook!\u201d I turned the collar of the sweater inside out to show the tag, on which was written in sharpie: *Emily B.* \u201cIt looks like there\u2019s a trail that goes up that way,\u201d I added, pointing along the slope.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the way we came from though.\u201d Ace squinted up the slope and then back toward the campsite. \u201cWe\u2019re way off track\u2026\u201d They tore another piece of blue tape from the roll and added it to a branch nearby.\n\n\u201cWe have to find them\u2014\u201d I began.\n\n\u201cWe could get just as lost as they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cAce! We can\u2019t abandon them\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRowan.\u201d Ace\u2019s eyebrows drew together. \u201cWe need to call this in. If we wander off into the woods, we might as well just put ourselves on the missing persons list!\u201d\n\nBack and forth we argued. I\u2019m the rash and stubborn one. Ace is the analytical, *equally* stubborn one. Ever since we were kids, I was always the dreamer, ready to set sail on some grand adventure. On my wrist I wore a bracelet reading, \u201cAll who wander are not lost.\u201d Whereas my older sibling followed only carefully charted paths, believing only in hard facts, and never in airy possibilities. Today, the moment they suspected we were off trail, they\u2019d started marking branches with their blue painter\u2019s tape and building piles of rocks alongside the path. After assessing the facts of a situation, they made their mind up, solid as bedrock\u2014you\u2019d move a mountain before you could move Ace.\n\nBut you\u2019d stop a bullet train before you could stop me, and I growled, \u201cThink of Emily.\u201d I pointed into the woods. \u201cShe\u2019s out there, and she needs her sloth. And if we leave and lose all trace of that lost little girl FOREVER, I will *never* forgive you.\u201d\n\nHesitation on Ace\u2019s face. The sun was sinking lower in the afternoon sky, chills starting up my arms, the rays a burning orange that turned Ace\u2019s mop of brown hair into a golden halo but darkened their features so I could barely see their scowl. If we were going to find this family before nightfall, we had to start looking *now*.\n\nAce made a frustrated sound in the back of their throat. Finally they swore, took out their roll of blue tape, and slammed it into my hand. \u201cThis is the STUPIDEST thing you\u2019ve ever done. But fine. You do what you\u2019re gonna do, and I will go call it in and then come back for you. I\u2019ll follow your trail. If you get lost and starve out here and die, I will never, ever forgive *you*. Mark *every fucking tree*, Rowan\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI will, promise. I will.\u201d\n\nMy sibling hugged me hard, then they spun on their heel and left. \u201cAnd for the record!\u201d they shouted over their shoulder. \u201cYou are a total moron!\u201d\n\nI flipped them the bird. Without even looking back to see this gesture, Ace was already raising their arm to flip me off in return. Then I turned and scoured the slope above\u2014*there.* It was right there, a well-trodden path, winding upwards. I marked it with the tape and started hiking.\n\nThe temperature seemed to drop as I ascended, as if the air up here was thinner, colder. But the trail itself was wide and free of debris, the afternoon sunlight filtering through the pines and dappling the leaf-strewn trail. It was an easy, uneventful climb\u2014so easy I nearly forgot to mark the trees. It seemed pointless with the path being so clear. I only put up the tape because I\u2019d promised my sibling, making sure that each blue ribbon was in eyeshot of the last.\n\nI\u2019d been hiking for about forty minutes when the path opened up suddenly in front of me, the slope leveling off, and there amidst the trees, in a small clear patch\u2014there was a cabin.\n\nA pink thermos sat on the front steps.\n\nI rushed over and snatched it up. The surface was covered in stickers of anime characters. Emily\u2019s? But then a question entered my mind:\n\n*Why isn\u2019t the cabin on our map?*\n\nI knew it wasn\u2019t on the map because Ace had checked the map relentlessly the moment they realized we were off trail. Maybe it wasn\u2019t there because the map was too old, or because the cabin was privately owned, or maybe we\u2019d strayed so far that both the path I\u2019d hiked and this cabin were in an entirely different area.\n\nBut none of that would explain why the missing family had found this cabin, entered\u2026 and remained missing, still.\n\n*They must still be inside.*\n\nWith that thought dread ballooned inside me. If I opened the cabin door, what would I find?\n\nSuddenly I very badly wished that my sibling were with me. I\u2019ve always been the superstitious one, who gets nervous about walking through graveyards at night. Ace never worries about flickering lights or haunted cemeteries or unknown horrors. Ace sees only electrical problems, or soil filled with decaying organic matter. Their fears are always practical: unpaid bills, authoritarian laws, muggings or violence. Never ghosts, curses, or\u2026\n\n\u2026 or whatever was waiting in that cabin.\n\nI glanced down at the plush sloth in my hand and back at the ajar door. The windows were cracked and dark. Grime caked the glass. The steps *creeeeeaaaked* as I reached for the door, and I felt my nose wrinkle and my stomach clench because of the smell. A *terrible* smell. It came wafting on the air. Like garbage and sewage and meat left out to fester.\n\nAn unbearable chill numbed my arm the moment I gripped the knob, and I braced myself and thrust the door open.\n\nTo my surprise, not only was the cabin brightly lit, but several faces turned toward me. A thin, tired-looking man raised a hand to his lips for silence.\n\n\u201cWha\u2014Are you Joel?\u201d I asked.\n\nThe man motioned to his lips again, more desperately. A woman at the seat across from him glared at me and shook her head. Her mouth had strange markings across her lips\u2014like she\u2019d drawn stitches over them. A little girl next to the woman looked at me anxiously, her eyes widening as she noticed the tattered sloth in my hand.\n\nThe last person, a long-haired man seated next to the tired-looking man, did not turn around in his seat or move at all, and I could only see the back of his head.\n\nAll four of them had their hands holding each other\u2019s on the table, except for the finger that Joel had raised to silence me. He motioned me to sit in the chair to his left.\n\nThis was so strange. I had so many questions. I came over and pushed the sloth toward the little girl, saying as I sat down, \u201cAre you Emily? People have been\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c*Shhhh*.\u201d Again the finger at his lips in a stern reprimand, and then the door to the cabin slammed open.\n\nI yelped, gasping as a hand gripped mine firmly\u2014Joel had hold of my arm\u2014he jerked me closer and pointed to himself, to his eyes, and closed them. I glanced to his wife, his daughter, already with their eyes squeezed shut. That was all the warning I had before I heard the footsteps, and I started to turn my head\u2014\n\nHis fingers dug into my arm.\n\nI squeezed my eyes closed.\n\n*Something* stepped inside through the open door. *Thud. Thud.* The scuff of footsteps on the wooden slats. And the sound of chuckling.\n\nThere was something vaguely familiar about the voice. I couldn\u2019t place it, but the longer I listened, the more familiar it seemed, like a word on the tip of my tongue, or a name I couldn\u2019t quite remember to a familiar face.\n\nThe footsteps, and the soft cackling, drew closer. There was also something unpleasant with the footsteps. A smell. The waft of something rotten, or maybe of body odor. And then a whisper in my left ear, as if lips were just next to my skin. A cold, rotten breath. I think it whispered my name.\n\nThe fingers on my arm tightened in warning.\n\nThe whispering moved, now to my right ear. *Thud. Thud.* The footsteps moved around the table. I almost opened my eyes to see who or what was in the cabin with us\u2014but instinct told me not to look.\n\nThe steps circled around the room, and then receded out the door, which clicked shut.\n\nThe pressure on my hand eased, and I opened my eyes. The first thing I saw was four faces turned towards me, three of them anxious and worried. Joel, his wife Patty with her stitched lips (Oh God, were the stitches real?), their little daughter Emily. But the fourth face\u2014I gasped, and Joel\u2019s hand squeezed mine again, *hard*, reminding me not to speak. Or scream.\n\nSitting next to Joel was the long-haired man who must have been Uncle Mike, in a worn jean jacket, recognizably the long-haired stick figure drawing from Emily\u2019s notebook. But where his eyes should have been were gaping bloody sockets, and his mouth was also stitched with thick black thread.\n\nJoel tapped a finger on the table and pointed to the center.\n\nFor the first time, I saw the words etched into the wood:\n\nSPEAK, AND BE SILENCED.\n\nLOOK, AND BE BLINDED.\n\nLEAVE, AND BE BOUND.\n\nWHEN THE LAST CHAIR IS FILLED, YOU WILL BE FREE.\n\nMy gaze lifted again to Uncle Mike, and then passed across the faces of the other three, looking at me with anguish. I bolted upright, but Joel seized me, shaking his head fiercely. He jabbed a finger at Emily. At first I thought he was saying, *Don\u2019t you dare abandon my daughter.* But then I realized he was pointing at her hands. She had not reached to pick up her sloth, despite having looked longingly toward it. Then I saw the little girl\u2019s frightened eyes drift from me to her hands. Her hand holding her mother\u2019s. And her other hand on the table.\n\nThey weren\u2019t *holding* hands.\n\nTheir hands were nailed to the table.\n\nJoel squeezed my arm again and mouthed the words: *LEAVE, AND BE BOUND.*\n\nAll the air left my lungs. I collapsed back into my seat. The wheels of my mind ground to a halt with panic. *Impossible*, was all I kept thinking. *Impossible. Impossible.* Terror numbed my brain, blocking all rational thought. Who was keeping them captive? Why? And why did their captor sound so familiar? Next to me, Joel still held a grip on my arm, but used his other arm to push the sloth to his daughter. She laid her head down on the plush fur. \u201cThank you,\u201d she mouthed to me.\n\nI nodded numbly. I couldn\u2019t speak, so I carefully freed my arm from Joel\u2019s grip and mouthed slowly, \u201cAre there cameras? How is he watching you?\u201d\n\nConfusion on Joel\u2019s face. I repeated the mouthed question, and then I started tracing out letters on the table. His gaze followed and he nodded. In this painstaking way, we were able to have a conversation.\n\nMe: Who is he?\n\nJoel: We don\u2019t know.\n\nMe: How long have you been here?\n\nJoel and Patty shrugged. Tears from Emily who only shook her head.\n\nMe: Does he always know if you try to leave?\n\nMore helpless shrugging. Joel eventually conveyed to me that Emily and Uncle Mike were the ones who spotted the path and found the way to the cabin. It looked dilapidated to Joel, but Emily and Uncle Mike thought they heard someone calling from inside, so the whole family entered. That\u2019s when they noticed the writing on the table. They were trying to decipher what it meant when *it* came inside. Uncle Mike had *looked*, and *it* had taken his eyes while he screamed at everyone else to run. Patty took Emily one way while Joel ran the other. Joel tried to lead their pursuer off, but he got lost in the woods. Patty and Emily somehow got turned around while fleeing and wound up back at the cabin with *it* on their heels. They tried to hide inside and barricade the door, but *it* forced the door open. By the time Joel returned to the cabin he found his wife and daughter with their hands nailed to the table, his wife with her mouth sewn shut.\n\nNow, he traced out his message on the table with his finger while mouthing the words.\n\nJoel: I can\u2019t leave them.\n\nI pointed to myself and mouthed words as I traced back: You don\u2019t have to. *I\u2019ll* escape and get help.\n\nJoel: But you would need a distraction to even get out of the cabin.\n\nMe: Can you distract it long enough for me to get clear?\n\nJoel gave me a pained look. It was obvious he was afraid of bringing even more harm on himself and his family.\n\nMe: I\u2019ll bring help! It\u2019s the only way to save Emily!\n\nJoel shook his head and sighed. But his wife, who could neither speak nor move her hands, stomped her foot and caught his eye. She gave a fierce nod. Emily looked at me with shining eyes. \u201cThank you for my sloth,\u201d mouthed the little girl. \u201cPlease save us.\u201d\n\nJoel exhaled and pressed his palms to his eyes. I didn\u2019t know if he was scared, or just in despair. But he sat like that for a long time and finally he turned his head to me and actually shouted, \u201cRUN!!\u201d\n\nHis booming voice startled me out of my chair. Behind me, the door burst open. \u201cDon\u2019t look!\u201d Joel added as he lunged past me, putting himself between me and the intruder, and I don\u2019t know if his eyes were open or not. All I know is he screamed, and Emily let out a sob, and I felt my way blindly to the wall and along it toward the door even as that sinister chuckling passed right by my ear. Joel groaned, and there was a loud *WHAM* as he was slammed back into his seat. And then the *thud thud thud* of a hammer.\n\nThen I was outside! Pulling the door shut behind me, I opened my eyes and bolted for the trees.\n\nThe sky was deep purple, just enough light for me to see. How many hours had passed? How long ago had sun set? I ran down the slope, and ran, and ran, and ran, not even caring which direction. All I thought was, *AWAY!* My legs and lungs burned as I flew down the slope\u2014\n\nAnd stumbled to a halt, because in front of me was the cabin.\n\nLaughter sounded from inside. The door creaked open.\n\nTurning away, I sprinted back into the woods. By now I had a stitch in my side. This time I went upwards.\n\nI was still stumbling through the bracken when the chuckling, which had been behind me, was suddenly in front of me. No matter how many times I tried to go deeper into the woods, the laughter of that maddeningly familiar voice kept returning, too close, herding me back, and sometimes calling my name: \u201cRowaaaaaaan\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd then I was at the cabin again, all the wind gone from my lungs, the voice whispering my name just behind me.\n\nNO!\n\nI rushed inside and slammed the door shut.\n\nJoel\u2019s hands were nailed to the table. His eyes were squeezed shut. Patty and Emily looked at me in despair.\n\nI took my place quickly. Then the door burst open.\n\n*THUD THUD*\u2014footsteps, clunking fast after me, and then that rotten breath wafting into my ear, heavy and close, fingers squeezing into my shoulder.\n\nPanicked, flailing, I fought blindly against my assailant\u2019s grip. My fist connected with a *smack* against skin and bone, but the\u2014thing? Person?\u2014was unfazed, the grip tightening, stronger than ever, and the thing was laughing. Laughing in my ear.\n\n\u201cNOOOO!\u201d The scream tore from my throat.\n\nROWAAAAN, its eerily familiar voice growled in my ear. It didn\u2019t sound human. And yet I *knew* its voice, familiar the way a tune is familiar when you\u2019ve forgotten the words. A tune like a lullaby. Like I\u2019d known this thing from before I was even born.\n\n\u201cLET ME GO!!!\u201d I shrieked.\n\nI screamed, I spat, I fought with everything I had, but its powerful grip only dug in harder, more painfully, like talons. I felt myself dragged, writhing, from my chair, my heels scraping across the floorboards as it hauled me across the cabin floor\u2014\n\n\u201cROWAN! ROWAN, STOP IT! IT\u2019S ME, ACE!\u201d\n\nSuddenly it was just a voice\u2014a human voice\u2014barking at me over and over as I was hauled down the creaking steps and into the dirt. Ace\u2019s lanky silhouette leaned over me, their face flushed as they panted with exertion.\n\nGasping, I blinked up at my sibling. The sun was so low in the sky that the stars shone through the skeletal branches.\n\n\u201cAce?\u201d I groaned.\n\n\u201cYes\u2014thank fuck!\u201d gasped Ace, dropping down into the dirt beside me. \u201cOh thank fuck! I think you broke my nose\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat *happened?* Hell if I know! Why were you sitting in there holding hands with rotting corpses?\u201d\n\nCorpses?\n\nI whirled to look back at the cabin. We were in the dirt just below the front steps. The door hung open. Inside was dark, but the smell\u2026 the smell that wafted out made my stomach buck. Ace snatched my arm and pulled me towards the trees. \u201cLet\u2019s get the fuck away\u2014\u201d\n\nI jerked back instinctively\u2014\u201cBut, Emily,\u201d I said. I was too confused to do much more than cast a quick look behind me as my sibling tugged me into the pines. The cabin looked even more dilapidated than I remembered, the window panes cracked and missing and the roof sagging like it was about to collapse. Through the darkness of the open door, I could make out vague shapes, still and solemn, positioned around the table\u2014\n\nAnd then Ace was pulling us into the bramble. I asked why we didn\u2019t take the path back down, and my older sibling snapped, \u201cThere\u2019s no path. I was barely able to find your markers.\u201d\n\nIt felt like I was lost between dream and wakefulness, in some strange limbo while Ace shined their phone flashlight around, trying desperately to catch the beam on the occasional blue tape wound round branches, or on piles of stones or pieces of clothing tied around trees\u2014apparently Ace had supplemented my trail with their socks, a headband, and other items from their pack. Even so, it was harrowing trying to find our way through the darkening twilight. We reached the campsite just as pitch black descended.\n\n\u201cAre the police coming?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Ace still had hold of my hand, as if afraid to let go. \u201cI didn\u2019t get very far before I decided I\u2019d rather die being stupid with you than go for help and risk losing you.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\nSo. There were no authorities coming to look for us.\n\nWe built a small fire and huddled together to wait for dawn while Ace told me slowly, haltingly, what they\u2019d seen.\n\nThey followed my blue tape trail to the cabin and found me sitting at the table, eyes squeezed shut. When I didn\u2019t react to my name being called, they noticed the family appeared to have simply died sitting around the table holding hands. And I was holding their hands, too. It freaked them out. Then they saw one of the family had no eyes\u2014that the eyes had been wrenched out and one of the eyeballs was held in the free hand. The man had apparently plucked out his own eyes. Between this and the reek of decomposition, Ace rushed out and threw up. When they finally stopped being sick and came back inside to get me, I came bursting out past them and ran\u2014ran and ran and ran, and they chased me around the cabin two or three times before they found me sitting back in the chair holding hands again. That\u2019s when they grabbed me, and I punched them in the nose.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d I said quietly. And then, dreading the answer: \u201cDid you\u2026 see anything on the table?\u201d\n\nAce was silent for a long time before grunting, \u201cYeah\u2026 Something about \u2018when the last chair is filled.\u2019 And it was freaky as shit, because all the chairs were filled except the last one.\u201d A strange laugh bubbled in their throat. \u201cY\u2019know I almost felt like sitting down? Weird impulse.\u201d\n\n*Thank God you didn\u2019t*, I thought. It was Ace\u2019s total lack of imagination, their dismissal of that thought as nonsensical, that probably saved them *and* me.\n\nWe waited until the sky turned grey, and then we finally staggered to our feet and found our way to the deer trail and back to civilization, where we reported our finding of the missing family.\n\n\u2026 But the family is still missing. The authorities got as far as the campsite before being unable to follow our markers. They are all still there, their spirits trapped within that cabin. Nailed for eternity, for as long as their souls will have to wait. Waiting for me to bring help. I\u2019m sure I could find my way, but\u2026 I\u2019m too afraid. I don\u2019t know what happens if that last chair is filled. I know something will change, but the thought of it happening fills me with the deepest, most terrible dread.\n\nIf I tell you where to look, will you go and save Emily?\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t be stuck forever, I don\u2019t think.\n\nWHEN THE LAST CHAIR IS FILLED, YOU WILL BE [FREE.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/QuincyLee\/comments\/11nxwz3\/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by\/)"},"74":{"title":"This Job Interview Almost Killed Me","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kg6g5u\/this_job_interview_almost_killed_me\/","flair":null,"author":"Street_Chrome","selftext":"After weeks of annoying the police, they finally look inside the building. The fifth floor is empty. No desk, no computers and no account managers. It was a bare office, grey walls, dirty carpets, and dust everywhere like no one was ever here. Those things are out there, luring people in with a empty promise, preying on the unemployed.\n\nIt was Saturday night, John and Seymour argued louder and faster. Other bar goers were staring at us. I was getting bored of their conversation after three beers in, my news feed becomes more interesting. My boredom and alcoholism lead me to the job app NOW HIRING. I scrolled through jobs, quickly reading their requirements and salaries. I wasn\u2019t looking for anything specific or taking it seriously, I was passing time. At one point the jobs became too weird or had little to no information. I sent my resume to a few entry level jobs, not expecting to hear back from any of them.\n\n\u201cYou hear this guy?\u201d Seymour said while grabbing my forearm, snapping me back to reality. \u201cHe said that Star Trek: The Next Generation is overhyped.\u201d He turns to John. \u201cYou know it was the highest rated show of its time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it wasn\u2019t awful, but it was on the verge of being cancelled for a reason. Their writing was bad.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s space camp.\u201d Yelled Seymour.\n\n\u201cBad first two seasons.\u201d John reiterated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna go out for a smoke.\u201d I announced, the bar was packed but I managed to squeeze past the crowd.\n\nLighting my camel blues I sat on a stoop next door. The night was busy, drunk white people were walking the streets. I scrolled some more until I reached the ninth post on the thirteenth page.\n\n**Entry Level Account Managers - Urgently Hiring!!!**\n\nNY Bankers \u00a0\n\n**Job Details**\u00a0\n\n**$41,000 - $62,000 a year ++**\n\n**Commission Pay**\u00a0\n\n**Full-time**\n\n**Full Job Description**\u00a0\n\nWe are looking for recent grads and motivated individuals to join our diverse company.

Just two taps on my phone and they have my contact information.\u00a0\n\nThe next day I was hung over, and very hungry, my roommates were cooking. I staggered to the bathroom with my towel and loofa. The warm shower woke me up.\u00a0\n\nRING!\n\nAn unknown number. I let it go to voice mail.\n\nRING!\n\nI silence it.\n\nRING\n\nI angrily turned off the water and answered.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\n\u201cHi is this Austina?\"\n\n\u201cYes. Who is calling?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Brian!\u201d He sounded positive and chirpy. \u201cI\u2019m with New York Bankers. We saw your application on For Hire and we\u2019d love for you to come to the office for an interview. We\u2019re having a interview event today and we can squeeze you in.\u201d Brain said with much enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cToday is Sunday. You guys work Sunday?\u201d\n\nHe chuckles lightly. \u201c Yeah. When the banks close, New Yorkers are open! We pride ourselves on filing, account managing, and book keeping for New Yorkers any day of the week. Holidays and weekends!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, today isn\u2019t great for me. Can we reschedule for tomorrow?\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow?\u201d He sounded hurt. \u201c Tomorrow we won\u2019t be doing interviews, today is your only chance. We\u2019re gonna be here till 3pm.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t know how to get out of this conversation.\n\n\u201cLook Austina. You\u2019re probably having second thoughts right now. It\u2019s a Sunday you probably want to stay in bed all day right. I would too, but I wouldn\u2019t be in the office right now, if I knew there wasn\u2019t money to be made here. NY Bankers is a fast paced work environment we work closely with our clients and they\u2019ve come to trust us. We offer paid training and large commissions. If you want to start making a lot of money this is your chance.\u00a0\n\n\u201cSure. I can come in at 1:30pm.\u201d I caved to Brian\u2019s sale. He gives an address. It\u2019s by Union Square park. He tells me how lucky I am to get this opportunity and what it means to be apart of New York Bankers. I hang up and return to my shower.\n\nI finished my shower, quickly dried myself, put on my pjs, grabbed my laptop and typed New York Bankers.\n\nI found a website of a stock photo slide of New York City. Each photo had blurbs about their company. They were all vague and meaningless attributes of their performances. Quotes of their accomplishments from random \u201cclients.\u201d Whenever I clicked on anything outside of the home page it lead me to a construction page. I\u2019d seen enough. These guys are scammers, I closed my laptop and laid on my bed. I decided not to go. I looked at the job posting on my phone. I was thinking about reporting the post until the idea came to me.\n\nI grabbed my suit jacket, put my phone in the front chest pocket, camera facing out. It was a perfect fit, the camera was above the flap. I hit record and did some test shots. The footage is good, but the sound wasn\u2019t.\n\nFound my good tape, cut out little squares and taped a LAV mic cable on my chest. I connected it to my phone via a small hole behind my chest pocket, hide it well. It looked really discreet, no one could tell I was recording them. Finally I moisturized, dried my hair, picked out the rest of my outfit and left confident in this interview.\n\nThere was a farmer\u2019s market happening, I bought coffee and doughnuts and went across the street to NY Bankers. It was a corner glass building, 12 stories tall with a balcony patio. The building reflected the blue sky from every angle like it was apart of the sky. Beautiful, reflective and bright.\n\nThere was one banner inside, it hung behind the front desk. Despite the people walking around me, no one seemed to notice that this building exists. There was no one in the lobby, it was empty. I went through the revolving door.\n\nAn empty black marble room, cool A.C, one long red mat that lead to a hallway. The banner had an outline of the five boroughs with the word \u201cBankers\u201d spelled across it.\n\nDown the carpet was an elevator.\n\nDING!\n\nInside there was only one glowing button. Five.\n\nDING! Men and women in suits sat on black cushion seats against a white wall. A male receptionist looked at me.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou must be Austina! I\u2019m Brian.\u201d He had the same cheery personality she heard on the phone.\n\n\u201cAm I late?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. You\u2019re right on time.\u201d He points to the large lobby room where men and women were sitting. \u201cTake a seat with the rest.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter where.\"\n\nThere was one seat open in the middle. I had a clear view into the office, I got a pan shot of the office as discreetly as I could.\n\nFour rows of desks with men and women hunched over typing, reading, talking and calculating. Few were silently arguing in their phones, trying not to disturb the peace. Others had small talk by the water cooler, few were at the patio. They all looked middle aged and most of them were large and tall. Most of them were white, few were black and brown.\u00a0\n\nIt seemed like another world, I had so many questions.\u00a0They all ignored us and looked into their computer screens. Some were happy, others had no expression at all.\n\n\u201cHey. How long have you been waiting?\u201d I whispered to the tall black women to my left.\u00a0\n\n\u201cTen minutes.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this strange?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, It\u2019s an off market trading company. Large accounts making their next move.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds illegal.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at that man, in the red shirt, in the back.\u201d She nods her head to a man with a red shirt and grey pants. \u201cHe never puts the phone down. He\u2019s making calls. To who? Families that rest on Sundays.\u201d\n\n\u201cShady. All of it\u2019s shady.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoney is money if it\u2019s dirty or clean.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can call me Patrica.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Austina.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s such a white girl\u2019s name.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey, this is my city. I ain\u2019t getting scammed by these idiots. Think about what they\u2019ll make us do?\u201d\n\n\u201cLearn to take the money. People with gold don\u2019t let go.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are something you know that?\u201d\u00a0\n\nShe chuckles. \u201cI\u2019m the whole package.\u201d\u00a0\n\nWe waited for fifteen minutes. The office seemed to be in a loop. One conversation begin, another ends, when that one ends, a new one begins. They were lively for a Sunday.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey Brian?\u201d I walked up to the desk. He looks up from his desktop. \u201cWho are these people? When you said you work Sunday, I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect.\u201d\n\nHe chuckles at the question. \u201cSo these guys are our senior staff. They\u2019ve been with us longer and have clients that require special attention.\u201d Brian said. \u201cThink of us as an accounting firm, but you don\u2019t have to worry about working weekends. New hires have regular hours. Today is the only time our hiring manager can conduct interviews.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow long have y\u2019all been open?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe opened at 2020. We began working remote but are slowly letting senior staff in.\u201d\n\nAn older man with a large stomach and a tucked in blue shirt. \u201cHello Brian. Is this everyone?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes. They are all accounted for.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you one of them?\u201d The older man looks at me.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d I say proudly. \u201cI\u2019m Austina.\u201d\n\nHe holds his hand out, we have a firm handshake.\n\n\u201cGreat! Join your colleagues, we\u2019re moving on soon.\u201d He said. I sit back down. He pulls up his pants and steps forward to the line of people. \u201cThank you for arriving, especially on a Sunday. I\u2019m Alexander, the hiring manager. If you all follow me, I\u2019ll lead you all to another waiting room.\u201d\u00a0\n\nWe all chuckle.\u00a0\"Please have your resume ready.\u201d He announced.\n\nThe hairs on my arms raised, my shoulders shivered. Keeping my smile and composure, I stayed cool. I was so focused on my outfit, I forgot to print my resume, I was racking my brain trying to figure how I can do this.\n\nAlexander lead us to another waiting room. This time the seats were across from three conference rooms. We had a clear view of the conference room and interview. The walls and door were glass. Three men sat at the far left end of the conference table. They looked like Alexander. Big gut and tucked in dress shirts.\n\n\u201cOkay everyone grab a seat. The first interview will take about twenty minutes, afterwards we\u2019ll ask a couple of people to stay for a second interview. Thank you for your patience.\u201d He pulls the door open. \u201cOkay let\u2019s start from the left side.\u201d He point at a young man with a blue shirt and black suit. He follows Alexander inside.\u00a0\n\nSweat runs down my temple. Other applicants have their printed resume on their laps.\u00a0\n\nOne by one we go into the conference room. Alexander does most of the talking while the applicant listens. They do ask for the resume. The other men only ask one question then Alexander talks a bit more.\u00a0\n\nIt was my turn. Alexander points to me, welcomes me in the conference room. My heart races, avoiding his blue eyes. He closes the door behind me. He joins the rest of fat old men.\u00a0None of them introduced themselves, they all nod at me.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re Austina?\u201d the first large man asks.\n\nHe gestures to the seat, but I don\u2019t sit. \u201cYup that\u2019s me! I applied last night and got a call from Brain this morning! I\u2019m very curious about this place. I\u2019m excited to learn from y\u2019all.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you have your resume?\u201d Alexander asks.\n\nMy heart beats like crazy. My back stiffens, I clenched my fists, cleared my throat and answered truthfully.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need my resume.\u201d They share a look of confusion. \u201cA good saleswoman doesn\u2019t need references or experience. All that we need is ourselves and a friendly attitude. My pervious jobs won\u2019t tell you anything that will satisfy you.\u201d Unbuttoning my suit jacket. \u201c Let me repeat that, nothing I say can satisfy you. What matters is the thick of my skin and my smart head. Every New Yorker has gotta be tough. So let me tell you about me. Stuff I\u2019m proud of. I was born and raised in New York City. I went to college for two years and returned to the city to build my net worth. Currently I\u2019m working in Macy\u2019s selling perfume. A very high commission job with a lot of competition.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat were you studying?\u201d\u00a0The second large man asks.\n\n\u201cCommunication and Media. Social Media skills.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very popular field. Why did you leave college?\u201d Alexander follows up.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe college didn\u2019t have a great communication department. There weren\u2019t enough courses for people in my major. It didn\u2019t live up to my expectation.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you plan to go back?\u201d The third large man asks.\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo. I believe the greatest learning tool is first hand experience.\u201d I stood up. \u201cYou see before I worked in Macy\u2019s I interned at Buzz Feed. I learned a lot from them, how to manage social media and SEO. One thing I learned is the value of an image.\u201d\n\nI stepped closer to the large men.\n\n\u201cYou see presentation matters, sure. But what\u2019s really important is the substance. If we aren\u2019t authentic to ourselves and others then how can anyone believe anything that we are selling? Consistency and Communication are the most important traits for entrepreneurs. In our modern age anyone can be anything with a instagram post. Who we are is a front, what counts is what we're selling.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow are you in accounting and filing?\u201d The second large man asked.\n\n\u201cI have the memory of an elephant. I had great experience working with analytics and data sets. One of my tasks at Buzz Feed was predicting our engagement.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long did you work at Buzz Feed, why did you leave it for Macy\u2019s?\u201d The third large man asks.\n\n\u201cSimple. My goal is to own and operate my own social media app. Buzz Feed was a great experience for me to see how a media company operates. Macy\u2019s is a way to support myself as I build my own app from my room.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very ambitious. Does anyone support you?\u201d Alexander asks.\n\n\u201cNope. I live alone, I\u2019ve dumped all my savings into this project. I\u2019ve been doing this for the past two years.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow. What attracted you to this job?\u201d The first large man asks.\u00a0\n\n\u201cSimple, the management experience. I would love to learn how you all work with clients and meet their need. I know my company will have difficulties and hiccups, but a good leaders needs to work under strenuous circumstances. A good leader will make it work. I can\u2019t wait to get started and prove to you that I\u2019m an exceptional saleswomen and leader.\u201d\n\n\u201cAustina. Thanks for your time. Return to your seat. Please stick around.\u201d Alexander says as he opens the door for me. He points at Patrica, she goes inside.\n\nMy heart calms down. Breathing in and out, the blue sky from the patio calms me.\n\nI take my seat and rest my head against the wall. I wipe the sweat from my brow and the watch the other applicants go in the conference room, one by one. After the last one, Alexander steps in front of us. \u201cThank you for waiting. We appreciate everyone for spending their Sunday with us. I\u2019m gonna go through a list of names, these are people who we believe aren\u2019t suited for the job. We\u2019re looking for people who have certain skills that we believe can improve our company.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAlexander goes through a list of names.\u00a0\u201cUnfortunately I wish I could hire you all. Please leave your resume at the front desk.\u00a0 We appreciate you coming here, but we\u2019re going with the other candidates.\u201d My name wasn\u2019t called.\n\n\u201cEveryone who is staying please stay here. We\u2019ll have lunch ready soon.\u201d\n\nHalf of the applicants leave. Patrica stays.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat did y\u2019all talk about?\u201d She asks me.\n\n\u201cNothing. I just told them about background.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe too. Nothing about the job.\u201d\n\nThe last of the people left.\n\nAlexander and the other interviewers stood in front of us.\u00a0The light go out, everyone puts away their phones.\n\n\u201cWell lunch is served.\u201d\u00a0\n\nSuddenly they began unbuttoning their shirts. All the office workers stood up, doing the same.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I yelled.\n\nAlexander ignored my objection, he kept unbuttoning.\u00a0Their stomachs aren\u2019t stomachs. A lip? A seam like a long scar, but it had a different skin tone. Alexander\u2019s stomach was opening. It was happening everywhere. The office workers began changing. Everyone burst out of their clothes, naked and wide open. Their skin changed to a pale color. Their stomaches unfolded, their ribcages are teeth.\u00a0\n\nA mouth opens, wider and taller than Alexander. I didn\u2019t scream or run, the red flesh of the mouth-stomach opened up and licked its ribcage-teeth.\n\nA wide slimy red tongue latches on me and pulls me inside its mouth. In a matter of seconds the mouth closes on me, it's pitch black. Its teeth pierced my ankles, it tries to bite my head but I dodged the canines. I scream, writhed, kicked and punched everything I could. Nothing freed me from the tongue.\n\nI saw the sharp tooth from the corner of my eye. I swerved my head left, barely missing it. I could feel the teeth crunch down on my ankles. Everything kept getting tighter, it wanted to finished its meal.\n\nWith sheer force I pushed my left arm against the tongue to give myself some space. With my right arm, I reached for my suit pocket. I grabbed my phone and pull out the LAV mic wire. I balled it up in my left hand.\n\nI tied the wire around the tongue, luckily it was long enough, and strangled the muscle with all my strength, I screamed \u201cLet me out!\"\n\nSuddenly something echos, a scream from deeper inside. Gurgles of flesh and monstrosity. Real light peeked from behind me. I didn\u2019t let go until I saw the office ceiling. The gurgles turned to a monstrous scream.\n\nIt spat me out on the floor, I scramble to my feet and I ran towards the exit. I ignored the pain as much as I could but my left ankle was like a dog\u2019s chew toy. I hid behind an office desk and bandaged my foot with a cloth from my suit. I looked at the office and I didn\u2019t know what I was looking at.\n\nThey were all large, tall, and wide, there was nothing human. It was like a Venus flytrap but with arms and a tongue. A large set of teeth and a pair avian arms like a bat. It\u2019s jaw rested on the floor along with some lumps of fat.\n\nTheir mouth-stomaches were gnawing and chewing on the applicants. Few were pulling apart their limbs. Others chewed with their mouths open. Chucks of human flesh were minced by the sharp teeth of their mouth-stomaches. Patrica was gone, I looked for anyone alive. The red shirt was backed in a corner, they surrounded him, three monsters ripped him apart. His clothes and blood flew everywhere.\n\nSaliva drooled down their lips. The munching and gnawing filled the room. It smelled foul. I kept moving towards the hallway, sticking to the desks. They ignored me, too busy with their food. I came to the elevator, I kept pushing the button.\n\nI finally looked back at the monster that I came out of, it writhes in pain. Others attended to the injured one, they helped him stand up, they rubbed his mouth-stomaches. They turn around to the patio and climb up a ramp?\u00a0\n\nThey walked past the patio railing, on the blue sky. Each step they took revealed an invisible ramp. A bright light appears just above them. Another room. I caught a glimpse of a grey room with long reflective panels. Alien letterings and icons. In the center, the creatures laid on their side, their stomach mouths eating huge plates of meats. They only wore gold necklaces.\n\nBefore the injured monster enters the invisible room, it yells something, a word, a sentence? I don\u2019t understand it but everyone stops. Their yellow eyes stare at me. They all finish chewing their food and get up.\u00a0\n\nThey run towards me!\u00a0\n\nDING!\n\nI step in and hold the close button.\u00a0\n\nIt closes just before one of them reached me.\n\nI put my back against the wall.\n\nDING!\n\nI run across the lobby. I push through the rotating door and bolt out of there. I run across the street, but the park was empty. I ran into the subway and tried to find a cop.\u00a0\n\nFinally I see a cop, a human, waiting by the subway gate. I grabbed his arm and yell \u201cI need your help!\u201d I leaned on him, start to heave and cry. Frantically explaining what happened to me and why I\u2019m covered in red slime. He tries to calm me down, I know I sounded insane, but I had to show someone the monsters posing as bankers. He might\u2019ve believed me, but he talks into his radio and calls for a medic. He brings me back outside where an ambulance arrive. I frantically tell them to check the building and go to the fifth floor. The cop assures me that he will, but I know he won\u2019t. Medics surround me, they rest me on their stretcher and treat my ankles.\n\nDetectives are the first to greet me, I tell them everything that happened. They can\u2019t search the building unless they have a warrant. They ask me how I got in. \u201cIt was unlocked.\u201d I answered. \u201cI went inside and took the elevator to the fifth floor.\n\n\u201cThat building hasn\u2019t been leased in years. We called the owner, no one has been inside.\u201d The detective said.\n\n\u201cBut I applied to a job on Now Hiring. Their receptionist called me and asked me to go there for a job interview.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did an interview with Human-eating alien monster?\"\n\n\u201cI FORGOT MY RESUME! I SAT ACROSS A WORKING OFFICE FULL OF PEOPLE! THERE WERE OTHER APPLICANTS! PATRICA IS MISSING! NEW YORK BANKERS! WHEN BANKS ARE CLOSED, NEW YORKERS ARE OPEN! THEY CALLED ME! I SAW THEM TURN INTO MONSTORS! THEY TRIED TO EAT ME!\u201d\u00a0"},"75":{"title":"I found the love of my life and I thought she was my soulmate\u2026","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kgcvar\/i_found_the_love_of_my_life_and_i_thought_she_was\/","flair":null,"author":"NathanielPhoenix","selftext":"**I met my wife a long time ago and thought our life was perfect. Our life was perfect until I discovered something horrible.**\u00a0\n\nSo I was 18 years old at this time of my life and I wanted to marry someone really badly. I went to bars a lot to search for a woman suitable for me. I wanted a loving, caring and motherly woman who would care for our kids.\u00a0\n\nI wanted to have at least two children.\u00a0\n\nSo one night I went to this bar. I believe it was called Craig\u2019s bar and restaurant. It was a nice small and cozy place where you could drink in peace and have good conversations with people without the music being too loud. There were people dancing on the dance floor. Then I spotted this beautiful woman.\n\n\u00a0She was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. She had long hair that was a deep red colour. Amazing facial features and an astonishing body. I felt butterflies.  \n  \nI got nervous as I realized that I had to go talk to her. I shook off the nerves and approached her. \u2018\u2019 Hey, What\u2019s up?\u2019\u2019 I started casually. Her answer took a while but then she said \u2018\u2019Nothing much. Just vibing\u2019\u2019. I could feel that she found me attractive. \u201cWant to grab a drink with me?\u201d I asked. Took a lot of courage to get those words out but I was glad I did. \u201cSure!\u201d\u00a0\n\nWe walked to the bar counter and I ordered a beer and she ordered a cider. After that we got ourselves a table and sat down. We talked about life and about everything. I fell in love, I could feel we had good chemistry and I asked for her number but she insisted that I\u2019d spend the night at her place and so I did. Nothing sexual happened but we slept in the same bed and the conversation that started at the bar didn\u2019t end until we fell asleep.  \n  \nHer name was Rosanne and she had really beautiful green eyes I couldn\u2019t see at the bar. They almost looked like they belonged to a snake.\n\nThe next morning I woke up feeling like shit. \u201cHeyy! You\u2019re up\u201d she yelled all excitedly. I flinched as I thought I was home alone. \u201cHey! you scared me,\u201d I told her and barely got a word out as my mouth was so dry. \u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d I asked. \u201cYep\u201d she told me and went to the kitchen.  \n  \nShe came back in 15 minutes and brought me breakfast to bed. \u2018\u2019Ohhh nice! Thank you so much\u2019\u2019 I said to her while giggling like a little kid.\u2018\u2019I love cooking and I thought you deserved a homemade breakfast\u2019\u2019 She answered and blushed. So we spent the whole day in bed and I spent another night there. The next day I went home and talked to her on the phone. Actually after those two nights spent there I called her every day. We usually talked for a couple of hours and got to know each other so well. We also went on dates every other weekend. She was perfect for me. I wanted her to be my wife and soulmate for the rest of my life. I was also perfect for her or so I thought. It felt so sudden, how could I fall in love so quickly?\n\nA year goes by and it was awesome. I proposed and we got married. The wedding was small and modest. We invited only a handful of people and it went really well. It was simple but effective. At one point my wife disappeared and came back hours later. It was weird and a bit rude to the guests. Her dad came to me at one point and said \u2018\u2019Where is Rosanne? She always disappears at the worst moments.\u2019\u2019 Whatever that meant.  \n  \nShe seemed completely normal after she was back. At one point though I was sure I saw her pickup a frog and put it in her pocket. \u201cWhat is she going to do with that?\u201d I thought but left it at that. I figured she was just drunk and wanted to prank me as I was pretty drunk too.\u00a0 I can\u2019t even remember anything after that. The wedding was perfect.A month later we were out eating at a restaurant. \u2018\u2019How do you feel about having kids?\u2019\u2019 I asked.   \n  \nI had been thinking of having kids for six months and she would make the perfect mother. \u2018\u2019I don\u2019t like kids. They are loud and they smell,\u2019\u2019 She answered. \u2018\u2019Have you thought about us having kids? I would love to have at least one,\u2019\u2019 I told her all excitedly. \u2018\u2019No my darling. I don\u2019t think that is such a good idea,\u2019\u2019 she told me. I was dumbfounded.\u2018\u2019What do you mean?\u2019\u2019 I asked. She told me that she can\u2019t be around kids for some reason but I deserved them and some day she would be ready. The woman I married didn\u2019t want kids with me, why?  \n  \nWe left the conversation at that. I kept thinking about it for a couple of weeks but figured out she would tell me when she was ready for kids.\u00a0\n\nAfter that night she woke me up by bringing me breakfast. \u2018\u2019Good morning my handsome prince\u2019\u2019 She said and gave me a plate full of eggs. bacon and beans. \u2018\u2019That was really kind of you my dear\u2019\u2019 I told her while smiling very widely. She always made me breakfast on the weekends. It was the best.\n\nThe next week, my wife disappeared again. It was Saturday and we watched a movie on our couch. Suddenly she leaves in a hurry and the weirdest thing is that she didn\u2019t even say anything, she just left. She came back 3 hours later. It was almost midnight and that was weird.  \n  \nI was just watching the movie alone when all of a sudden I heard. \u201cBabe, want to go upstairs?\u201d I jumped so high that I hit my head on the lamp. \u201cWoah, where did you go?\u201d I asked while visibly annoyed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it my darling\u201d She calmly told me.  \n  \nI did not go upstairs with her that night as I was pretty mad at her for leaving during the date night we had planned. I slept on the couch that night and I reconsidered our relationship the whole night.I kept debating with myself about whether I should stay or leave as this was deeply unsettling. It was a huge red flag,  \n  \nI had thoughts about her cheating on me but I married her so I trusted her and it was just a passing thought.\u00a0\n\nThe next week a similar thing happened. We were supposed to go eat dinner at a restaurant. I had reserved a table at a very high end restaurant. I was excited because I saved a lot of money for this specific date night. As we are leaving to the restaurant she says \u201cI need to use the bathroom, go start the car.\u201d I do just that and around 15 minutes go by. I began to wonder, where is she? How is she taking so long?\u00a0\n\nI waited another 15 minutes. Nothing. She didn\u2019t come back so I decided to go check out what is going on and why is she taking so long.\n\nI went inside and walked upstairs to our bedroom. I thought she would be there putting on more makeup or doing some finishing touches, maybe even doing her hair over and over. I walk in and she\u2019s not there. Only thing I see are her clothes on the floor.   \n  \nThe same clothes she was supposed to put on for our date. \u201cWhy are these on the floor?\u201d I thought. It was bizarre that she would do this on our date night and it was not the first time either.\u00a0\n\nI started to look around the house but she was nowhere to be seen. I walk in the kitchen and I hear this weird hissing sound coming from under me. The basement, why would she be there? There was nothing in there and no reason for her to go inside the basement.  \n  \nI walked the stairs to the basement and it was dark. It also smelled really funky. It was very warm and humid there. That was not the case earlier.\u00a0 Then I hear some movement behind me and look over there. It\u2019s dark but I have a flashlight so I turn it on. \u2018\u2019hisssss\u2019\u2019 It hissed at me. The half snake half woman hissed at me.\u2018\u2019What the fuck!\u2019\u2019 I yelled at the monster who turned out to be my wife. The puzzle just clicked and that\u2019s where she always disappeared to.  \n  \n\u2018\u2019Don\u2019t look at me\u2019\u2019 She said with this raspy, snake-like voice.  \n  \n\u2018\u2019How could you hide this from me?\u2019\u2019 I asked while getting angry at her for hiding this.  \n  \n\u2018\u2019I thought you would leave me if you knew,\u2019\u2019 She told me.   \n  \n\u2018\u2019Is there a way out of this? Is this a curse?\u2019\u2019 I wanted to figure out how this was even possible.   \n  \n\u2018\u2019It\u2019s a curse that can\u2019t be lifted,\u2019\u2019 she answered. \u2018\u2019 I can\u2019t be saved. Please kill me and stop this madness\u2019\u2019 Rosanne said while starting to weep.   \n  \nI thought about it for a while. She returned to human form and we talked this through. She did not want to live anymore because every time she turned into a snake. She got this hunger for human souls and she told me she prefers to feast on younger people as their souls are more pure than grown humans. I had to think about the situation and what could be done.  \n  \nEvery night I had these nightmares of her stealing children and feasting on their souls. It was terrifying to think about. I kept going back and forth between killing her and helping her.   \n  \nYou are thinking \u2018\u2019Why would he help her?\u2019\u2019 I know it sounds bad but I got that idea because she was perfect.  \n  \nWe had a nice relationship and I never had to worry about anything after coming home from work. She kept the house clean and made me dinner. I couldn\u2019t make my decision then and there. I needed to think it through.  \n  \nOne day we talked about the situation on our hands and she told me how and why she was cursed. She told me that when she was younger her parents were homeless and wanted to get stability in their lives.  \n  \nThey found this mysterious ad on a lamp post and it was about some shaman helping people get what they want. So her parents went to visit that shaman and they got an offer. They would get everything they ever wanted but it would cost them their first ten thousand euros. It was clear the money had to be their first ten thousand ever. They accepted but didn't know what would happen if they didn\u2019t pay him. She told me that because they were homeless after they got the money they totally forgot that deal made with the shaman.\u00a0\n\nThe shaman never told them what would happen if they would not pay him. Soon they found out. As her mother gave birth to my wife she was healthy and all was well but by the time she turned five. She would turn into this half snake half human form. Her parents did not know what to do. It was not natural and so they remembered the shaman who helped them out of poverty. As they visited the shaman he told them that it was too late to do anything and it was all their fault for not following their deal. My wife got cursed by that shaman because her parents forgot to pay him.   \n  \nHearing this made me want to help her even more. She did not cause this and deserved a good life. A good life that was ruined by her parents' actions. One day, exactly 5 days after what happened I was walking on the street and I saw this poster of a shaman offering spiritual readings. I got an idea and went to visit that shaman as soon as I could. I located his cottage which was a little hard to find but I managed to find it. I knocked on the door. He opened the door and he looked old, really old. He looked like he was over 90 years old.\n\nI then asked him about the situation and he told me that he was the shaman who helped those homeless people. He also told me the same story my wife did and that gave me a little\u00a0 bit of hope.  \n  \nHe spoke very calmly and was not one bit angry.  \n  \nHe told me that there could be a cure but he had to check from some book, so I waited.   \n  \n30 minutes go by and he comes back. I can feel that the thing he found is not good. \u2018\u2019There is no cure or any way to reverse this,\u2019\u2019 He told me. He also said that it was a strong curse because they had made a deal. Once the parents and the shaman both agreed her fate was set. That felt so wrong, I had so much hope in me. That was all for nothing. I still decided to stay with her and not let her die. It was not an option.\u00a0 Before leaving the shaman's hut he said something weird. \u2018\u2019A person\u2019s love is the only thing capable of removing something this horrifying\u2019\u2019. I didn\u2019t answer and just left.  \n  \nI walked back home feeling pretty low. I could not get that sadness to go away. It was a 15 minute walk and I kept thinking about what would happen and how we could cure her.  \n  \nI got to the front door and opened it. The house was really quiet, no sounds at all. \u2018\u2019Rosanne\u2019\u2019 I shouted but no answer. I walked up to our bedroom and there she was. She was laying on the bed and there was blood all over her. I started to cry as I realized she had done what I couldn\u2019t.   \n  \nThere was a note beside her and I read that. In that note she told me how much she loved me and how great I was. She also apologized for doing this but she could not endanger anyone anymore. She also told me that we would get married in the next life.  \n  \nI read it and with each word I cried louder. I just kept having these flashbacks of all the good things we did together. All the late night walks, dancing at our wedding, dreaming about moving to another country and all the late night laughs we had before falling asleep together.  \n  \nI lost everything that night.\u00a0 I lost her, the brightest light in this world of darkness. I still have her clothes in my closet and I still can\u2019t let go."},"76":{"title":"My Reflection Isn't Mine Anymore. It's Practicing.

This specific, creeping wrongness. It\u2019s getting worse.\n\n\n\nMoved into Apt 4B fast, three weeks ago. Bad breakup, messy, humiliating. Had to run, didn\u2019t look close. Cheap rent, pre-war building, edge of nowhere interesting. You know the type. Thin walls \u2013 hear muffled neighbors fights like trapped ghosts. Bedroom radiator clangs: clang-clang-clang, pause, clang-clang. Always. Like Morse code for ha ha ha. Floor slopes west just enough my cheap office chair drifts to the wall unless I wedge my heavy Gardner's Art book under a wheel. Place smells\u2026 old. Dust from FDR maybe, lead paint probably explaining past tenants. And underneath that\u2026 faint, sharp, metallic tang. Like ozone or old pennies. Or old blood you tried to scrub out. Strongest near the ancient fuse box in the hall closet. Told myself it\u2019s just old building crap. Can't complain, sound nuts.\n\n\n\nJob? Remote data entry. Stare at spreadsheets till numbers blur. Cheap instant coffee tastes like acidic dirt. Landlord did the five-minute speed-walkthrough. Talked \u2018original charm\u2019 (cracked tiles, dripping faucet). Pointedly ignored the brown water stain blooming across the bedroom ceiling like a diseased lung. Didn\u2019t care then. Just needed anywhere else.\n\n\n\nPlace has too many reflective surfaces. Didn't register it properly at first, numb from everything. Bathroom medicine cabinet mirror, huge, half the wall, bottom corners perpetually fogged like trapped breath. Living room window faces a close brick wall, reflects the room back greasy and dim, especially revealing at night. And the bedroom\u2026 dominated by massive, floor-to-ceiling mirrored closet doors. Tarnished fake-gold trim, pure 80s tackiness. Supposed to make the room feel bigger. Just makes it feel vast and judgy. Makes you feel watched. Never alone. Always seeing yourself.\n\n\n\nFirst week, unpacking hell. Cardboard ghosts. Exhausted. Upstairs neighbor seemed to combine competitive furniture bowling with grief-stricken sobbing around 3 AM nightly. Didn't care.\n\n\n\nSecond week. Things felt\u2026 off. Not jump scares. Smaller. Weirder. Insidious, like finding mold just out of sight. Sitting on the floor, sorting books. That heavy Gardner's textbook, spine wrecked from college. Set it on the \u2018keep\u2019 pile left of me. Felt the thud. Glanced up. Living room window reflection, dim afternoon light, dirty glass acting as a murky mirror. In the reflection\u2026 clear as day\u2026 the book was still inside the cardboard box I'd just pulled it from. Cold. Stomach went ice cold. Looked down \u2013 book physically on the pile. Looked back at the reflection \u2013 correct now, showing the book exactly where it was, mocking me. Tired eyes? Old warped glass? Grabbed the excuses like lifelines. Needed them.\n\n\n\nBathroom mirror. Hung my blue towel \u2013 one frayed edge I never snip \u2013 on the hook beside the sink. Went to brush my teeth later, head down, avoiding my own gaze. Looked up quickly. My reflection looked back, but for a split second, the eyes\u2026 were they green? Mine are dark brown. Snapped back to normal instantly. Blinked hard. Imagined it? Then I saw the hook in the reflection: empty. Utterly empty. Breath hitched, loud in the small room. Reached out \u2013 physical towel right there beside me, damp terrycloth under trembling fingers. Looked back at the mirror. The reflection seemed to\u2026 shimmer? Like heat haze off asphalt? Then the blue towel just snapped into existence there, reflected perfectly. Condensation? Smudge? Brain glitching from stress, caffeine, heartbreak? Fine. Tried to ignore it. But felt that first real prickle of specific unease. Low down. Like swallowed stones.\n\n\n\nIt kept happening. Quick, unsettling flashes of wrongness, always contained within reflections. Always snapping back to normal the instant I focused, making me doubt myself relentlessly. Question my sanity. A coffee mug reflected on the kitchen counter, the one with the hairline crack I know I washed and put in the dish drainer minutes before. My reflection caught momentarily in the dark TV screen wearing the other sweatshirt, the grey hooded one still hanging on the back of the chair across the room. Tiny visual stutters. Glitches in the mirrored world that felt\u2026 deliberate. Pointed. Targeted. Like reality had typos only I could see, designed specifically to make me unravel.\n\n\n\nTried taking photos. Obsessively. Useless. Point my phone, reflections look subtly, undeniably wrong. Click the shutter. Check the photo. Perfectly normal mirror image. Every. Damn. Time. Holding the phone, looking at the digital picture that proves I\u2019m not seeing what I\u2019m seeing\u2026 it\u2019s a specific, insidious, perfectly executed form of psychological torture. Makes me want to smash the phone, smash every reflective surface in this goddamn apartment until there\u2019s nothing left to lie to me.\n\n\n\nTried calling Maya again. Tried to sound casual, joking about weird light, needing glasses, ha ha. \"Maybe cut back on the coffee?\" she suggested, voice laced with that careful kindness that telegraphs I think you're cracking up. \"Get some sleep, Sarah, okay?\" Didn't push it. Hearing my own shaky voice trying to rationalize reflections being actively wrong\u2026 sounded completely unhinged even to me. Hung up feeling the isolation clamp down harder, thicker. Breakup left a hollow space; this creeping wrongness was filling it with cold dread.\n\n\n\nThen it wasn't just momentary glitches anymore. A few nights ago. Sitting hunched on the second-hand couch (smells faintly of stale cigarettes and cat), rain hammering the windows, turning them into dark, slick mirrors reflecting the single lamp. Scrolling numbly through depressing news on my phone. That prickling feeling on my neck intensified \u2013 the stare. Not just a feeling this time. A heavy, physical certainty. Looked up slowly, deliberately, heart beginning its frantic drumbeat, at the living room window reflection. My own head and shoulders reflected back. Behind me, the reflection showed the bedroom door. Closed. Firmly shut, a solid, pale slab of wood in the murky reflection, looking unnaturally flat and final.\n\n\n\nExcept\u2026 I froze. Breath caught hard, painfully. I never close the bedroom door. Live alone. Makes the tiny apartment feel like a shoebox closing in. Suffocating. I always leave it open.\n\n\n\nHeart started that sick, heavy pounding against my ribs, panicked bird trapped inside. Didn't move. Didn't breathe. Just stared at the reflection, eyes wide. Closed door. Stayed that way. Five seconds. Ten. Fifteen. Long enough for the absolute, concrete impossibility to sink in, cold and sharp as glass under a fingernail. Slowly, fighting the tremor that started violently in my hands, I turned my head just enough. Looked over my shoulder at the actual bedroom doorway.\n\n\n\nWide open. A dark, yawning rectangle leading into the unlit room. Exactly as it should be.\n\n\n\nWhipped my head back to the window. The reflection instantly corrected itself. Open door. Matching reality.\n\n\n\nBut I saw it. It wasn't a flicker. It wasn't my brain misfiring. It was wrong, objectively, demonstrably wrong, and it stayed wrong until I looked away. Like it was waiting. Like it was flexing a muscle. Or testing the flimsy barrier between my reality and its\u2026 distorted, increasingly bold echo.\n\n\n\nLast night. Couldn't sleep. Predictably. The 3 AM radiator clang (three, pause, two) felt like hammer blows against my skull. Felt wired, raw, skin crawling. Every settling creak sounded deliberate, like footsteps. Kept glancing towards the bedroom door, shut tight now (by me, useless lock checked three times), thinking about those huge, dark closet mirrors lurking inside like predators. Finally dragged myself up for water around 2 AM, throat painfully dry, mouth tasting like old pennies, heart fluttering wild.\n\n\n\nWalked back down the short, dim hallway towards the couch, the only place feeling marginally less hostile. Had to pass the full-length hallway mirror near the bathroom. Tried to avoid looking. Watched my feet on the worn carpet runner, counting faded roses. But caught movement \u2013 or rather, a profound, shocking lack of movement \u2013 in my peripheral vision. Froze mid-step, muscles locking painfully. Forced myself to turn slowly, neck cracking, stiff with dread. Looked.\n\n\n\nStared into the hallway mirror. My reflection stared back. Looked\u2026 normal at first glance. Same worn grey pyjamas, same sleep-deprived eyes shadowed purple. But something was fundamentally, terrifyingly wrong. Took a sickening second for my oxygen-starved brain to register. My own chest was visibly rising and falling, breath coming in short, panicked gasps that were loud, wet, obscene in the utter silence. The reflection\u2019s chest was perfectly still. Utterly, unnervingly motionless. It wasn\u2019t breathing.\n\n\n\nWe stood there for what felt like an hour, probably only ten agonizing seconds. Me, gasping, dizzy, vision tunnelling. It, perfectly still, wearing my face like a freshly borrowed, poorly fitting, suffocating mask, not breathing.\n\n\n\nThen, its head tilted. A slow, deliberate, inquisitive movement that didn\u2019t match any muscle twitch I made, smooth yet somehow disjointed. Its eyes \u2013 my eyes, but suddenly vacant, glassy, like cheap doll's eyes reflecting dim light without depth or life \u2013 seemed to focus directly on me with a dawning, profoundly alien intelligence. Calculating. Assessing. Curious.\n\n\n\nIts lips parted slightly. Not a smile. Something worse. As if testing the mechanics of a mouth. A faint, wet clicking sound seemed to emanate not from the reflection's mouth, but from the surface of the glass itself, sharp and distinct. Click\u2026 click-click\u2026 Like saliva snapping between teeth that weren't quite real, or insect mandibles rubbing together.\n\n\n\nThat broke the paralysis. A strangled sob tore out, raw and ugly. I spun away, scrabbling blindly at the living room doorway like a trapped animal, stumbling onto the couch, burying my face deep into the musty cushions, muffling my own whimpering gasps. Didn\u2019t look back. Couldn't.\n\n\n\nSat there, shaking uncontrollably, drenched in cold sweat that chilled me to the bone, until the grey, indifferent light of dawn filtered through the dirty windows. Didn't hear anything else. But I felt it. The stillness behind me. The focused, calculating awareness emanating from that hallway mirror, even hours later, even facing away.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not just glitches anymore. It\u2019s not just watching. It\u2019s animating. Demonstrating independent movement. Making sounds. It\u2019s\u2026 practicing? Testing its borrowed form? Learning the basic mechanisms of life it observes, like breathing?\n\n\n\nThe reflection in my dark phone screen looks normal now. Tired. Scared. Haunted. Shattered. But the eyes\u2026 are they my eyes looking out? Or just holes reflecting dim light back at me? When I look away, do they keep watching? Do they blink when I don't? Do they practice expressions in the dark?\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t know what this thing is. But it\u2019s here. And it\u2019s learning my face. And I think it's learning faster now. Much faster."},"77":{"title":"I was born without a shadow.

They picture sunsets and fresh cow\u2019s milk, dusty picturesque fields and singing all day to cheerful work. But that\u2019s not the kind of story this is.  \n\u00a0  \nThis is the story of a scarecrow that was *watching me.*  \n\u00a0  \nIt began on an evening like any other, one of those nights where the silence felt too thick, like the land itself was holding its breath.  \n\u00a0  \nI was aching from chores, my clothes damp with sweat and dirt, my brain fried from the heat and the usual arguments with Mum about homework. I slumped into a chair by the kitchen window with a plate of reheated stew and glanced outside.  \n\u00a0  \nThat\u2019s when I saw it.  \n\u00a0  \nThe scarecrow.  \n\u00a0  \nIt had always stood out in the lower field, crooked and slouched like it had given up scaring birds. But now, I swear its arm had moved.  \n\u00a0  \nJust barely. A twitch. A tilt. Then slowly and unnaturally, the limb stretched sideways revealing a rusted scythe clenched in its other hand.  \n\u00a0  \nI stared, transfixed on it.  \n\u00a0  \nThe thing wasn\u2019t blowing in the wind because there was no wind. It was dead still outside, the kind of stillness that makes animals stop in their tracks and listen.  \n\u00a0  \nIts head turned.  \nNot swung, *turned*.  \n\u00a0  \nIntentionally, like a man adjusting his neck after a long sleep.  \n\u00a0  \nIts stitched grin pulled wider as its burlap face tightened and for a moment, I felt it looking straight through the glass and into me.  \nThat terrifying sneer\u2026 I\u2019d somehow seen it before.  \n\u00a0  \nMy breathing stopped and a pressure built in my chest while a scream started forming just under my ribs.  \n\u00a0  \nI blinked  \nand when I opened my eyes\u2026  \n\u00a0  \nIt was back to normal.  \nIt was just a regular scarecrow on the pole again.  \nSagging\u2026 quiet\u2026 *pretending*.  \n\u00a0  \nI forced myself to eat, trying to shake off the feeling. But even in my room behind closed doors, I couldn\u2019t stop checking the window. I told myself it was my imagination.  \nStress. Hunger. Fatigue.  \n\u00a0  \nBut deep down, I didn\u2019t believe it.  \nIt felt too real to be my mind playing tricks on me.  \n\u00a0  \nThe rain came later, slow and steady. It smeared the glass and turned the outside world into a distorted abstract painting. Perhalps a Pollock piece.  \n\u00a0  \nThe trees swayed in the distance, branches contorting in the wind. The calves were bawling from the barn, anxious and loud like they could sense something was out of place.  \nLike they knew someone was out there with them.  \n\u00a0  \nAnd then while gazing into the distance, something obscured my vision  \n\u00a0  \nA silhouette.  \n\u00a0  \nNot on the pole.  \n\u00a0  \n**At my window.**  \n\u00a0  \nThe scarecrow stood there, face pressed nearly flat against the pane, just inches from mine.  \n\u00a0  \nIt didn\u2019t tap.  \nIt didn\u2019t scratch.  \nIt just stared; a blank, motionless stare.  \n\u00a0  \nIts lips curled in what could only be described as eagerness to be let in.  \n\u00a0  \nI fell backwards, slamming my head into the wooden floor. The room spun like a grand carousel.  \nWhen I managed to scramble back to my feet, I gasped  \n\u00a0  \nThere was nothing there.  \n\u00a0  \nThe rain still fell but the window was almost dry.  \nIn the reflection, I could see my own face and behind it, for a split second, a flash of black buttons where eyes shouldn\u2019t be.  \n\u00a0  \nI checked on Mum and she was in the lounge, her face wet with tears.  \n\u00a0  \n\u201cThe paper never came,\u201d she said, trying to sound brave, but her voice cracked.  \n\u00a0  \nShe wasn\u2019t waiting for news about crops or the weather.  \n\u00a0  \nShe was waiting for word about him.  \n\u00a0  \n**My father.**  \n\u00a0  \nHe\u2019d gone to prison after what he did to her.  \nUnspeakable and depraved atrocities that deserve the death penalty.  \n\u00a0  \nI used to lie awake at night imagining him getting what he deserved in prison.  \nBut now\u2026 I wasn't so sure.  \n\u00a0  \n\u201cHe\u2019s not coming back,\u201d I told her. \u201cYou know that.\u201d  \n\u00a0  \nEven though I had lost confidence, I had to be strong for her.  \nI had to protect her.  \nSomething in the dark was stirring.  \nGetting closer every passing second.  \n\u00a0  \nBy morning, the rain had stopped, but the sky still looked bruised.  \n\u00a0  \nI walked out to the field, legs trembling, unsure if it was anger or fear holding me together.  \n\u00a0  \nThe scarecrow waited.  \n\u00a0  \nI stopped a few metres away, staring into that blank, burlap face, mustering up every bit of confidence I had.  \nIt had dried blood on the fabric.  \nOld, sickly brown, crusted deep into the weave.  \n\u00a0  \n\u201cYou\u2019re not real,\u201d I whispered.  \n\u00a0  \nI stepped forward.  \nSeized it by the neck.  \n\u00a0  \n\u201cMove again, you brainless fuck,\u201d I taunted. \u201cDo it!\u201d  \n\u00a0  \n**It moved.**  \n\u00a0  \nNot suddenly. Not with force.  \nJust with certainty.  \n\u00a0  \nIts arms lifted, slow, but solid.  \n\u00a0  \nThe illusion of straw faded.  \nBeneath its sleeves human skin emerged.  \nNot normal skin.  \nSkin charred and warped, blackened like meat left on an open flame too long.  \n\u00a0  \nFingernails melted to the flesh.  \nSnapped bones protruded from split sinew.  \n\u00a0  \nIt grabbed my wrists with a strength that didn\u2019t belong to an inanimate sack of hay and I couldn\u2019t pull away.  \n\u00a0  \nIts face began to peel.  \n\u00a0  \nThe sackcloth unravelled, thread by thread, as if it was been shut to hide the unspeakable horrors that lay beneath.  \n\u00a0  \nIt was a man\u2019s face.  \nOr what was left of one.  \n\u00a0  \nThe skin hung in patches, lips fused into a permanent sneer. One eye was gone and in the socket was just a black hole like an endless abyss of depravity.  \n\u00a0  \nThe other eye, still attached and very human, burned with recognition and malevolence.  \n\u00a0  \n\u201cThomas,\u201d it rasped.  \nA voice like a dying and feral animal, wheezing through collapsing lungs.  \n\u201cYou look just like her.\u201d  \n\u00a0  \nThe hat blew off, revealing his skull, bare black veins still pulsing faintly across scorched tissue.  \n\u00a0  \nHe raised the scythe  \nand I didn\u2019t have time to scream before it came down.  \n\u00a0  \nMetal sank into my shoulder with a wet, crackling crunch.  \n\u00a0  \nPain swallowed me whole.  \n\u00a0  \nI felt the blade split through skin, muscle, bone.  \n\u00a0  \nMy blood poured into the dirt like a cascade.  \nI screamed and squirmed until somehow, through blind panic and raw survival instinct, I managed to break free.  \n\u00a0  \nI ran like the wind and didn\u2019t look back.  \nI couldn\u2019t even if I wanted to.  \n\u00a0  \nI bolted to the house, crimson blood dripping with every swift step.  \nI slammed the door behind me, my shoulder burning like it was on fire.  \n\u00a0  \n\u201cMum!\u201d I cried.  \n\u00a0  \nShe turned, pallid as if her soul had been sucked out.  \n\u00a0  \n\u201cThe paper came,\u201d she stated weakly.

It sounded like a little girl who\u2019d been dragged face-first through gravel.\n\nIt sounded like\u2026\u00a0\n\n\u201cGretchin?\u201d I whimpered, horror seizing my lungs.\u00a0\n\nThe Ma\u2019am knelt beside me. Her arm draped across my shoulders, light as silk and cold as a blade. \u201cYou recognize your sister, do you, Boy? Good. This is what failed drafts become after they\u2019re devoured by the wood. It\u2019s what you\u2019ll become.\u201d\n\nShe leaned in. Whispered in my ear.\u00a0\n\n\u201cDo you know what it sounded like? Listening to your older sister get chewed alive by these very trees?\u201d She smiled. Not smug but fond, like she was remembering an old family recipe. \u201cIt sounded wet. Noisy. Perfect.\u201d\n\nI slammed my eyes shut.\n\nI couldn\u2019t look. Couldn\u2019t breathe.\n\nGretchin sighed. \u201cMa\u2019am not bring\u2026 Food\u2026\u201d\n\nThen, with a final snap of twisting bone, my older sister straightened. Her snout turned toward the dark. Sniffed. And just like that, she was gone. Swallowed by the forest again.\n\nI collapsed to my knees. \u201cPlease\u2026\u201d I begged, clutching the hem of her dress. \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me here. I promise I\u2019ll be good. I\u2019ll be good.\u201d\n\nShe looked down at me with mock surprise. Then crouched. Cupped my cheek.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said gently. \u201cYou had better.\u201d\n\nHer thumb traced the spot where she\u2019d struck me earlier. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a kind woman, I\u2019ll give you one more chance. That\u2019s it. Break another rule\u2026 and I\u2019ll feed you to your sister. Am I clear?\u201d\n\nI nodded so fast it hurt.\n\nShe turned. \u201cThen come.\u201d\n\nI followed, and the forest watched us. I could feel it. Every branch an eyelid. Every shadow a snare.\n\n\u201cWhy did Gretchin turn into that?\u201d I asked. The question fell out of me before I could stop it.\n\nTo my surprise, the Ma\u2019am didn\u2019t look angry. She looked\u2026 pleased. \u201cBecause I gave the girl hunger, then let her starve. That\u2019s the trick, Boy.\u201d\n\nShe twirled as she walked, like a child in a summer field. Her dress flared around her like black petals. \u201cMonsters born from want never stop chewing.\u201d\n\nShe glanced back at me, grin widening. \u201cThis whole wood is full of my monsters. And just like I did to them, I can end your story any time I please. *Remember that.*\u201d\n\nBy the time we reached the Crooked House, the sun had fled.\n\nThe sky bled purple and black as the silhouette of that shambling monstrosity rose before us. It loomed like a gravestone. Jagged, enormous. An omen of death.\u00a0\n\nThe Ma\u2019am said nothing. Just unlatched the door, pushed me inside, and locked it behind us.\n\nThere was no supper. No voice. No mercy.\n\nShe shoved me down the hall and into my room. It was a closet in everything but name.\n\nPeeling wallpaper.\n\nMold on the ceiling.\n\nA rotted mattress that oozed when I sat on it.\n\nA single slot window sat near the ceiling, boarded tight. I used to think it was to keep me in. Now I knew better.\n\nIt was to keep them out.\n\nThe door locked behind me with a sound like finality.\n\nClick. Clack. Slide.\n\nAnd then I was alone. Alone with the dark.\n\nI curled into a ball, wrapping the moth-eaten blanket around myself like a bandage. The room smelled like mildew and fear. Outside, I heard the woods whisper.\n\nThe Hungry Things hadn\u2019t gone far.\n\nTheir sounds rose through the night: snorts, snarls, bones cracking in the trees. Sometimes laughter. Sometimes chewing. Always near. Always waiting.\n\nAnd Gretchen\u2026\u00a0\n\nThe thought of my older sister broke my heart. I curled up, cried. Quietly. Not sobbing\u2014just the kind of crying where the body leaks and trembles.\n\nI didn\u2019t want the Ma\u2019am to hear.\n\nI didn\u2019t want her to remember I even existed.\n\nI must\u2019ve drifted off because at some point later the lock clicked.\u00a0\n\nMy body tensed.\n\nThe hinges creaked. The door whined open. Then came footsteps. Slow. Uneven.\n\nThe floorboard groaned beside my bed.\n\nI clenched my eyes shut. Held still. The Ma\u2019am. Had she changed her mind\u2014decided to drag me back into the Thousand Acre Woods after all?\n\nMaybe if I looked asleep she\u2019d go away.\n\nMaybe she\u2019d think I\u2019d learned my lesson.\n\nThen\u2014hands in my hair. But they were gentle. Fingers ran through my tangled curls, soft and shaky. A touch full of care. Lips pressed to my scalp. A kiss. Featherlight.\n\nNot the Ma\u2019am. Couldn\u2019t be.\u00a0\n\nA woman\u2019s voice rasped. Worn, weak\u2014but unmistakable. \u201cHappy birthday, Levi.\u201d\n\nCarol\u2026\n\nThe words broke me. I didn\u2019t move. I couldn\u2019t. The door creaked closed again, and when I rolled over, something waited on the floor beside my mattress.\n\nA teddy bear.\n\nHand-sewn. Lopsided. Beautiful.\n\nIts button eyes caught the moonlight bleeding through the boards. It looked like it had been stitched together from old blankets and worn-out clothes. Like love had held it together more than thread. I pulled it to my chest and held it tight.\n\nIt didn\u2019t feel like fabric. It felt like armor.\n\nLike safety.\n\nLike someone still saw me as something worth saving. And for the first time I could remember, I fell asleep not as a brat or a monster or a failed draft. But as Levi.\u00a0\n\nA boy who was loved.\u00a0\n\n# _______________________________\n\nThe memory burned away, taking with it the love, the warmth, the teddy bear.\u00a0\n\nGiving me madness in return.\u00a0\n\nFractured worlds spun around me\u2014shards of shattered dimensions tumbling through a black void. Portals clawed at my skin, my bones, my name, each one a gaping maw desperate to rewrite me into something else. I wasn't falling through space, I was being yanked apart by stories, each one howling to claim me.\n\nThen *crack*.\n\nA bang\n\nA *Big Bang*.\u00a0\n\nThe portals collapsed inward. The fractured planets folded like dying lungs. And I dropped, headfirst through a gullet of time and ink, falling into a universe reborn.\n\nI blinked. Above me stretched a red-brick alley that reached impossibly high, its walls touching a sky smeared with midnight and madness. Lightning tore across it, but the thunder that followed didn\u2019t rumble\u2014it screamed.\n\n\u201cIt is done.\u201d\n\nThe voice buzzed like a hive, layered and insectile, vibrating. Where, I couldn't properly place.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d answered a second, similarly implacable voice. \u201cIt would seem the Shuffle proved successful.\u201d\n\nIt spoke slower, words slurred through reversed syllables, like poetry played backward on broken vinyl. I\u2019d heard it before, once, in the tunnels beneath the Sub-Vaults, when the Jack of Clubs had taken me past the Spades. I hadn\u2019t understood it then.\n\nNow I could.\n\nWhy?\n\nSirens bled into the air, pulsing like a failing heartbeat: **\u201cWARNING. WARNING. MASS-CONTAINMENT BREACH.\u201d**\n\nShit.\n\nNot good.\n\n\u201cThe False Dealer has lost command of the Deck,\u201d buzzed the first voice.\u00a0\n\n\u201cBy the grace of Mother, our authority returns.\u201d\n\nAdrenaline yanked me upright. My breath tore in and out like a blade. The Shuffle. The Hearts had done it then. They\u2019d fed me to the storm. They\u2019d used me\u2014the second Joker\u2014to collapse the Deck.\u00a0\n\n**\u201cALL PERSONNEL ARE TO INITIATE LOCKDOWN PROTOCOLS. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.\u201d**\n\nThe storm above cracked again, and somewhere deep inside, I felt something unravel. Like a knot I hadn\u2019t known was keeping me alive had just been cut.\n\nIf there was a mass containment breach, that meant a bloodbath. Conscripts would be spilling down these halls soon enough, which meant I needed to\u2014\n\nSomething stepped out from behind me.\n\nAn Overseer, but not like any I\u2019d seen before. No porcelain. No mournful eyes. Just a chitinous carapace, mirrored and gleaming, with insectile mandibles that clicked with thought. Translucent wings draped from its back like a funeral shroud.\n\n\u201cThe Joker stirs,\u201d it buzzed.\n\nIts chest bore a card: 5 of Diamonds. Its chakram gleamed like a spinning sawblade, holstered across its spine. Diamonds were record keepers. Redactors. The kind of Overseer that decided whether corrupted narratives\u2014urban legends, creepy pastas and the like\u2014were archived, rewritten as Conscripts, or erased outright. Diamonds edited reality with surgical violence.\n\nFootsteps echoed behind it. Heavier. Human-shaped. Almost. If humans were eight feet tall.\u00a0\n\nA second figure emerged, draped in funeral-black armor so sleek it might have been lacquered in ink. An angular helm obscured its face, but the spade-headed spear in its grip was unmistakable. A vivisection tool masquerading as a weapon.\n\nThe card on its breastplate read: 10 of Spades. The most powerful rank the Deck contained. At least, outside of the Jack.\u00a0\n\nIt stepped forward with solemn grace and knelt before me, like a priest preparing last rites. \u201cThe Joker\u2019s purpose has been achieved,\u201d it intoned, the words twisted like metal. \u201cThe Deck has been fractured. Our kin are now free of the False Dealers\u2019 control.\u201d\n\n\u201cRecommended action?\u201d buzzed the 5.\n\nThe 10 of Spades tilted its head. \u201cPurge the variant. Prevent further disruption.\u201d\n\nAnd just like that, I was prey again.\n\nI shot down the corridor.\n\nNo plan. No map. Just pure, terrified momentum. My boots slapped against wet metal. Lightning split the sky above. The alley buckled and stretched like it couldn\u2019t decide which story it belonged to.\n\nBehind me came the soft buzz of wings. The 5 of Diamonds rose like a hornet from hell, chakram hissing free from its back. It zipped ahead, dropping from the sky to block my path.\n\nI skidded to a halt.\n\n\u201cRemain still,\u201d it chittered, raising its blade. \u201cYour purging will be cleaner.\u201d\n\nA voice, syrup-thick, drifted from the alley\u2019s shadows: \u201cYoo-hoo.\u201d\n\nThe 5 stiffened.\n\nOut of the gloom came something older than nightmares. Mister Neither stepped into the half-light like a wraith wearing a skin suit. His coat dragged behind him in tatters, stitched together with scraps of flesh that didn\u2019t belong to him. In one hand, he held a bouquet of blood-slick pocket-watches\u2014the kind issued only to Inquisitors. A trophy collection.\n\nHe\u2019d been busy.\n\nThe 5 of Diamonds froze. Buzzed. \u201cVariant identified: Joker.\u201d\n\nThe 10 of Spades advanced. \u201cThen we have acquired the Pair. Finish purging the first. I will handle the second.\u201d\n\nMister Neither giggled. His head tilted just a little too far. \u201cOh no, no, no, no. I\u2019m not the copycat. I\u2019m the original.\u201d\n\nThe laugh twisted into a snarl.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s my toy you\u2019re playing with.\u201d\n\nHe charged on all fours, an animal out for blood.\u00a0\n\nNo preamble. No wind-up. Just motion. A blur of fur, claws, and teeth. The 10 swung its spear to intercept, but Mister Neither collided with it mid-strike, knocking the Overseer off-balance. A claw raked across the 10\u2019s helm, peeling back the armored plating like fruit skin. Beneath, flesh pulsed, wet and unfinished.\n\nThe 10 retaliated with mechanical precision. It drove an elbow into Mister Neither\u2019s temple. The Hatter reeled. The spear came up again and slammed into his jaw with a bone-rattling crunch.\n\nBehind me, the chakram sang through the air.\n\nI threw myself sideways just in time. The spinning blade carved a molten line through the sewer grating beside me. The 5 of Diamonds landed, wings humming, already preparing the next strike.\n\nI dodged again, lunging to my feet.\n\nAn idea bloomed mid-sprint. Stupid, desperate, maybe fatal. But if I could pull the 5 into the fight\u2026 maybe Mister Neither wouldn\u2019t be the only one bleeding. It might give me time to escape.\u00a0\n\nYes! That could\u2014\n\nMy excitement deflated into shock. The fight was already over.\u00a0\n\nThe 10 of Spades loomed above Mister Neither, spear raised for the kill.\u00a0\n\n\u201cFarewell, Brother.\u201d\n\nMister Neither lay sprawled, jaw cracked and bloodied. For the first time, he looked hurt. Then he smiled.\n\n\u201cYou took the words right outta my mouth.\u201d\n\nThe spear came down.\n\nSo did the facade.\n\nIn one brutal movement, Mister Neither snapped the spear\u2019s tip in half and drove it into the 10\u2019s fractured helm. Ink geysered from the wound. The 10 staggered, armor failing, knees buckling.\n\nMister Neither buried his hand in its chest. \u201cI do so love my plot twists.\u201d He fished through pulsing organs like he was searching for spare change.\n\nThen he found it.\n\nHe wrenched free something slick and glowing. \u201cSpeaking of,\u201d he murmured, lifting it like a trader\u00a0 appraising a vintage. \u201cI believe I've found your Plot Device.\u201d\n\nBehind me, the wings stopped.\n\nThe 5 of Diamonds hovered midair, paralyzed. It had just witnessed something unthinkable: the murder of a 10. An elite rank. A pillar of the Deck. And now\u2014\n\nMister Neither bit into the heart.\n\nThe 10 of Spades let out a sound halfway between a scream and a prayer. Then it exploded. A wave of ink and ruin rolled outward, rattling the alley, blotting the sky.\n\nMister Neither licked the residue from his claws. Only they'd changed. Obsidian armor rippled across them now, their tips forming jagged spades.\u00a0\n\nHis eyes\u2014twin beams behind the tophat\u2019s veil\u2014found the 5 of Diamonds, and a new light flickered into existence, burning through the fabric like a third eye.\n\n\u201cGetting the picture, Brother?\u201d he asked, voice bright with madness. \u201cI\u2019m going to eat the Deck. One of every suit. I\u2019m going to become exactly what that stupid girl dreamed of turning into.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never become the Ace,\u201d hissed the 5. \u201cYou\u2019re a broken narrative. A torn card. You\u2019ll be purged before\u2014\u201d\n\nA spear bloomed through its chest.\n\nThe Spade\u2019s.\n\nMister Neither had called it back like a loyal hound.\n\nIt ripped through the 5\u2019s thorax. Glowed with stolen power. Then retracted just as fast\u2014dragging with it another twitching Plot Device. He plucked it from the blade like meat off a skewer and swallowed it whole.\n\nThe third eye pulsed brighter. A chakram erupted from his back like a diamond buzzsaw. He staggered forward, hunched, no longer able to properly stand upright, a manic grin on his face.\u00a0\n\nHe exhaled.\n\n\u201cDelicious.\u201d\n\nThen turned to me. \u201cTwo suits down. Two to go.\u201d\n\nHe wasn\u2019t just growing stronger. He was becoming coherent. That was the scariest part\u2014that he wasn\u2019t nonsense anymore. That he had a plan. A purpose.\u00a0\n\nA climax.\n\n\u201cNow then,\u201d Mister Neither whispered, voice slick with anticipation. \u201cWhere were we?\u201d\n\nHe snapped his fingers.\n\nReality blinked.\n\nThe storm-wracked alley was gone.\n\nIn its place: the circular chamber I knew too well. Pale stone walls. A single metal table. And upon it, like a wound that never closed, sat the rusted typewriter.\n\nWe were back.\n\nChamber 13.\n\nOnly now, it was different.\n\nThe ceiling gaped open, revealing the familiar moon beyond\u2014but no longer round and laughing. Its eyes were now hollowed craters. Black ichor dripped from its bisected smile, spilling down onto the keys of the machine like cosmic blood. The typewriter twitched with every drop, shuddering.\n\nI backed away from it.\n\nFrom him.\n\n\u201cWhy are you doing all of this?\u201d I demanded. My voice came out smaller than I meant. Frail. The voice of a boy.\u00a0\n\nMister Neither crouched beside me, bloodied pocket-watches jingling at his waist. \u201cCause I wanna fix my ending,\u201d he said simply. \u201cAnd the key to making this stupid machine work\u2026\u201d\n\nHis claw tapped my temple. Once. Twice. Harder the third time.\n\n\u201cIs buried in there.\u201d\n\nRealization struck like a thunderclap.\n\nThe Ma\u2019am.\n\nThe Wither Tree. The typewriter. The stories she carved from pain. From me. From Gretchen. From Carol and the Woodsman and every broken child she fed to the Crooked House.\n\n\u201cYou want to know how she did it,\u201d I whispered, heart folding in on itself. \u201cYou want to know how she used the typewriter. To write. To create.\u201d\n\nHis grin widened.\n\n\u201cIt was never me you wanted,\u201d I croaked. \u201cJust my worst memories.\u201d\n\nMister Neither\u2019s fingers closed around my skull, vice-like and tender at once. His strobing eyes pulsed like dying stars. \u201cWrong again,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThose weren\u2019t your worst memories.\u201d\n\nHis thumbs dug deeper. \u201cJust the worst so far.\u201d\n\nThen: *snap*.\n\nNot bone. Not sound.\n\nBut the world.\n\nIt cracked.\n\nFractured like a spine caught in the middle of a laugh. Everything fell away, stone, typewriter, and sky. I was pulled backward, screaming, through a door I\u2019d locked long ago. Into a memory I\u2019d buried in shadow. Into the moment she showed me the cost of creation.\n\nThe price of making a story real.\n\nThe moment the Ma\u2019am taught me what it meant to bleed on the page.\n\nThe Ma\u2019am\u2019s voice reached through the light like a dagger through silk. *\u201cCarol gave you a birthday gift, did she, Boy? Well, it\u2019s only proper I give you one too.\u201d*\n\nNot this.\n\nI fought the memory. Clawed at the vision, pushed back with everything I had.\n\nHer voice sharpened, closer now, like nails on glass. \u201c*I always told you you\u2019d die a violent death, you ungrateful little swine. Let me show you what I meant.\u201d*\n\n**NO!**\n\nThe scream ripped from my throat. The light shattered. I dangled in the Hatter\u2019s grip\u2014sweating, heaving, wild-eyed.\n\nHe stared at me, expression twisted with a snarl. \u201cWhat... did you just *do*?\u201d\u00a0\n\nI didn\u2019t know.\u00a0\n\nSomething inside me had pulsed. Like a thread pulled taut. Like a key turning in a lock I didn\u2019t know I had. I\u2019d resisted the Hatter\u2019s magic.\n\nThe Joker card burned in my pocket, softly thrumming against my leg.\u00a0\n\nDid it have something to do with it?\n\nWas I more powerful than I realized?\n\nThe Hatter clamped both over-sized claws around my skull. His breath hit my cheek in gusts that smelled like old paper soaked in rot. \u201cYou\u2019re stubborn. But you\u2019ll break. *Everything breaks*.\u201d\n\nAnd then came the pain.\n\n[MORE](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TalesFromTheCryptid\/comments\/jba8ww\/story_master_list\/)"},"80":{"title":"People don't believe I had a brother.

She was true to her name\u2014a diminutive, older woman who had to hop slightly to get settled into the chair opposite me.\u00a0 This was some kind of interview or therapy room in the hospital, slightly less cold and clinical than some parts I\u2019d seen, but in an artificial way that was no more inviting or comfortable.\u00a0 A soothing sea of pastel blue walls surrounded a reinforced door on one side and a small red panic button on the other.\u00a0 The doctor sat watching me expectantly and I felt a flicker of irritation that I forced back down.\u00a0 I\u2019d made the mistake of telling the truth to the psychiatrist, and that had landed me in here.\u00a0 Now it was time to stick to the plan and get back out.\u00a0 Calm, reasonable, cooperative and full of bullshit.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey, Dr. Smalls.\u00a0 It\u2019s good to meet you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe gave me a smiling nod and jotted something down.\u00a0 \u201cSo, I see you got checked in yesterday afternoon for observation.\u00a0 A therapist you were seeing had some concerns about some things you said.\u00a0 Is that right?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI felt my jaw flex slightly as I returned her nod, and I forced a small laugh to cover it.\u00a0 \u201cYeah, I feel embarrassed about that.\u00a0 I don\u2019t blame him for getting a bit freaked out, and I should have been more honest with him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe raised an eyebrow.\u00a0 \u201cYou weren\u2019t being honest?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTrying to look sheepish, I lowered my gaze and gave a small shrug.\u00a0 \u201cIn part I was, but\u2026the things I was telling him\u2026the bizarre stuff where my parents turned into monsters and killed and ate my brother?\u00a0 Obviously that didn\u2019t really happen.\u00a0 But it was a very real dream I had.\u201d\u00a0 I glanced up and she was paying close attention, so I went on.\u00a0 \u201cGrowing up\u2026well, I\u2019m still not very comfortable talking about it, but our parents were very abusive to my brother Mark and me.\u00a0 Very abusive.\u00a0 We made it through it, thank God, but I still have a lot of guilt and anger and anxiety about it all.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDr. Smalls frowned slightly.\u00a0 \u201cI see.\u00a0 Well, I\u2019m very sorry to hear that, Stephen.\u00a0 That must have been very hard to go through.\u00a0 For you both to go through.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo my surprise, I felt real tears coming to my eyes.\u00a0 \u201cIt was a lot worse for Mark.\u00a0 And he was younger.\u00a0 The baby.\u00a0 I was supposed to protect him, and I feel like I failed him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe jotted something else down.\u00a0 \u201cSo does Mark still have problems from all of this too?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSwallowing, I forced myself to take a deep breath as I pushed away thoughts of him staring at me as the thing that had been our mother consumed him.\u00a0 \u201cUm, yeah.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure he does.\u00a0 But we don\u2019t talk about it much.\u201d\u00a0 This next part was important, so I forced myself to focus and believe the lie as I said it.\u00a0 She needed to believe me on all of it, and especially this.\u00a0 \u201cBut back about six or seven months ago he started talking about going around them again.\u00a0 Missing them or something.\u201d\u00a0 I shook my head.\u00a0 \u201cI was against it, of course.\u00a0 I remember more of how they were, and people like that don\u2019t change.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDr. Smalls made a small grunting noise of affirmation and gestured for me to go on.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAfter he went a few times, I stopped hearing from him.\u00a0 I haven\u2019t heard from him since, which is really unusual.\u00a0 We\u2019re really close.\u201d\u00a0 I sniffed back more tears.\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s my best friend.\u201d\u00a0 Rubbing my eyes, I slumped back in the chair.\u00a0 The lies felt hot and dirty on my tongue, like vomit I needed to spew out before it made me sicker.\u00a0 \u201cIt brought back the anxiety really bad.\u00a0 I started wondering if they had turned him against me, or worse, if they had maybe done something to him.\u00a0 I started having strange, terrible dreams.\u201d\u00a0 I looked up and met her eyes.\u00a0 \u201cIncluding a version of the one I told my therapist.\u00a0 I had to let it out, and it seemed easier telling that than the truth.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe doctor let out a small sigh.\u00a0 \u201cI understand, Stephen.\u00a0 There\u2019s no one way to handle pain and trauma like that.\u00a0 I'm so sorry you\u2019ve gone through all that.\u201d\u00a0 She glanced back down at her pad and then back up at me.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s very understandable why you refused to see your parents\u2019 this afternoon.\u00a0 They\u2019ve been notified, and while they may still stop by to ask questions, please know that everything going on in your case is confidential and you will not have to have contact with them.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI sucked in a relieved lungful of air.\u00a0 \u201cThank you, doctor.\u00a0 That means a lot. And\u2026I\u2019m sorry for the trouble I\u2019ve caused.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe waved away my words.\u00a0 \u201cNot at all.\u00a0 That\u2019s what we\u2019re here for.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo when can I get back out?\u00a0 I have responsibilities at work, and\u2026\u201d\u00a0 I hooked my thumb at the panic button on the wall,\u00a0 \u201cWell, being here is kind of nerve-wracking.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDr. Smalls glanced at the button and then smiled at me.\u00a0 \u201cI understand.\u00a0 We try to make it comfortable, but it\u2019s still intimidating at first.\u00a0 And don\u2019t take the button personally.\u00a0 All of the interview and meeting rooms have them, just in case.\u201d\u00a0 Glancing back down at her notes, she tapped the paper with her pen.\u00a0 \u201cUnfortunately, we have to keep you for the full 72 hours\u2014there are some cases\u2014like yours\u2014where I\u2019d be inclined to release you early, but the hospital asks us to do the full observation once ordered for liability reasons.\u00a0 So that puts you getting out around\u20264pm day after tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI grimaced.\u00a0 \u201cNo way of getting out before then?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe shook her head.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m afraid not.\u00a0 But it won\u2019t be bad.\u00a0 You\u2019re welcome to stay in your room or go out into the public activity areas during the day and early evening hours.\u00a0 And I\u2019ll come talk to you again before you go home.\u00a0 Unless you have more you\u2019d like to tell me now, of course.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nGiving her a smile I didn\u2019t feel, I nodded.\u00a0 \u201cNo, but I appreciate it.\u00a0 Glad to come clean about what was really going on too.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe doctor hopped out of the chair and patted my arm as she passed by.\u00a0 \u201cSometimes confession really is good for the soul.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\u00a0\n\nThat evening was quiet.\u00a0 I stayed in my room, and while I hated being confined, the idea of a barrier between me and my parents was a huge relief.\u00a0 I\u2019d spent hours trying to think of what to do once I got out, but was no closer to any real answer.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat if they were just waiting outside the hospital, waiting to scoop me up?\u00a0 Or maybe not.\u00a0 They could just as easily get when I got back home.\u00a0 Other than running\u2014like truly running away and abandoning my life and identity\u2014what hope did I have of actually stopping them?\u00a0 But then again, what choice did I have?\n\n\u00a0\n\nI didn\u2019t sleep well that night, and was still fitfully dozing mid-morning when Dr. Smalls opened my door and stepped inside.\u00a0 Her cheerful demeanor from the day before was gone, replaced with a concerned frown.\u00a0 She asked if she could come in and speak with me, and sitting up on the edge of my bed, I told her sure.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nRubbing a hand through my hair, I offered her an uncertain smile.\u00a0 \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSitting in a guest chair on the other side of the room, she cleared her throat as she gave a small nod.\u00a0 \u201cIt seems that way, yes, though maybe it\u2019s just a misunderstanding.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI frowned.\u00a0 \u201cMisunderstanding about what?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell, you told me and everyone else about your younger brother, Mark, correct?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUm, yeah.\u00a0 Of course I did.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAnd you actually spent a great deal of your time with your therapist talking about Mark as well?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLook, what is this\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe raised a hand.\u00a0 \u201cPlease, just answer me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nLetting out a breath, I nodded.\u00a0 \u201cYes.\u00a0 I\u2019ve talked about Mark a lot.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMark, your biological brother, who you grew up with and is your best friend?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI felt myself starting to get irritated and pushed it back down.\u00a0 \u201cYes, that\u2019s the one.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDr. Smalls nodded.\u00a0 \u201cSorry, I just wanted to make sure I was clear.\u201d\u00a0 Smoothing her pants leg, she kept her tone measured as she continued.\u00a0 \u201cStephen, I did not meet your parents yesterday.\u00a0 But I did review some notes put into the system from the front desk when they arrived.\u00a0 They apparently said that you have delusions and they\u2019d like to see you transferred to a facility closer to their home.\u201d\u00a0 When I started to protest she raised her hand again.\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t worry, unless something changes, you are still getting out at 72 hours, and they don\u2019t decide such things.\u00a0 If that was all that had been said, I\u2019d have thought they were just trying to get access to you or delegitimize any accounts of abuse you might be sharing.\u00a0 But then they told the woman working the front desk something else.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI stared at her.\u00a0 \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDr. Smalls looked up at me again.\u00a0 \u201cThat you don\u2019t have a brother, Mark or otherwise.\u00a0 That you never have.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe shook her head.\u00a0 \u201cNot me.\u00a0 Them.\u00a0 Again, I put very little stock in a stranger\u2019s word, especially with what you told me yesterday about them.\u00a0 So I spent a couple of hours this morning trying to prove they were lying.\u00a0 Your psychiatrist took detailed notes from your sessions, and you have spent a great deal of time talking about Mark.\u00a0 Where he lived, where he went to school, all kinds of past and present details that should be verifiable.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI smiled.\u00a0 \u201cGood.\u00a0 Thank God.\u00a0 Thank you so much for taking the\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDr. Smalls gave another small shake of her head, her eyes sad.\u00a0 \u201cStephen, I can\u2019t find any trace of him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMy tongue began to shrivel in my mouth.\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2026that\u2019s not possible.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWas your brother born in the same county as you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI nodded.\u00a0 \u201cUm, yeah.\u00a0 He was.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe returned my nod.\u00a0 \u201cI guessed that might be the case.\u00a0 I can find your birth certificate, not his.\u00a0 I contacted his college.\u00a0 I had to push a bit, but I got them to check enrollment going back four years.\u00a0 No sign of him there.\u00a0 Our auxiliary office has access to a people search database.\u00a0 They use it to find relatives of patients and early debt-collection mainly, but it is surprisingly thorough.\u00a0 It can find most people if they\u2019ve ever held a job, rented an apartment or been in school.\u00a0 Not just them, but other people they\u2019re connected or related to.\u00a0 I asked them to run Mark an hour ago.\u00a0 And what do you think they found?\u201d\u00a0 She let out a sigh.\u00a0 \u201cNo sign of him at all.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMy mind was going in a hundred directions as she spoke.\u00a0 \u201cWas she in on this?\u00a0 Or being controlled, maybe?\u00a0 Anything was possible, but I didn\u2019t feel the sense of wrongness that my parents gave off.\u00a0 It seemed like she was being honest, and was honestly concerned that I was lying or crazy.\u00a0 So what, did they wipe his records or something?\u00a0 I didn\u2019t see how that was possible, but how could I rule it out with everything I\u2019d seen?\u00a0 If only\u2026\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDana.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDr. Small stopped and frowned at me.\u00a0 \u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI waved my hand.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026okay, so growing up, when Mark was in junior high, everybody was getting girlfriends and boyfriends.\u00a0 It was like a thing, okay?\u00a0 So him and this girl in his class, Dana, started \u201cdating\u201d, which really just meant they hung out awkwardly during breaks and after school a bit.\u00a0 Then some of his friends started making fun of them, so he ghosted her.\u00a0 Avoided her for like two months.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t even know most of it was going on until I came home from college one weekend and saw this sad girl sitting outside our house.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cShe told me that her name was Dana and she\u2019d been hanging out with Mark for awhile, but then he stopped talking to her.\u00a0 That it was okay if he didn\u2019t want to go steady or whatever, but she really wanted to still be his friend and hang out, if that was okay with him.\u00a0 It could have come off as weird or something, but she was nice about it, not creepy.\u00a0 He was just being a jerk and not listening to her.\u201d\u00a0 I gave a sad laugh.\u00a0 \u201cIt was about the only time I was ever disappointed in him.\u00a0 So I took her number.\u00a0 Memorized it and promised he would call and give her a chance to clear the air and let them start being friends again.\u201d\u00a0 I shrugged.\u00a0 \u201cI did, and he did.\u00a0 Ever since she\u2019s been one of his closest friends.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nDr. Smalls stared at me for a moment and then pulled out her cell phone.\u00a0 \u201cDo you still remember the number?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI nodded.\u00a0 \u201cI do.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHello, is this Dana?\u00a0 Hi, Dana.\u00a0 This may sound strange, but I\u2019m actually calling you to verify some information.\u00a0 My name is Dr. Smalls and I have a young man who is a patient of mine named Stephen who remembers you.\u00a0 More importantly, he says his brother Mark is one of your closest friends since junior high.\u00a0 I think you two even called yourselves dating for a bit back then.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI can see Dr. Smalls face droop and then harden as she listens to the woman on the other end of the line.\u00a0 \u201cI see.\u00a0 And you are certain?\u00a0 I see.\u00a0 Well, thank you very much for your time.\u201d\u00a0 When she ended the call, I already knew what she had heard.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t remember him at all, does she?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSmalls shook her head.\u00a0 \u201cShe does not.\u00a0 She says the only Marks she knows is her cousin in New York and the landlord for her building.\u201d\u00a0 Her tone grew cooler.\u00a0 \u201cAnd she did not appear to be lying.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI nodded bleakly.\u00a0 \u201cOkay.\u00a0 Um, I don\u2019t\u2026I don\u2019t know then.\u00a0 Maybe I can think of some other way to prove it, but if they can erase him from Dana\u2019s mind, why is the next thing going to work?\u00a0 I just\u2026\u201d\u00a0 I felt myself growing close to tears.\u00a0 \u201cThey just keep taking him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nDr. Smalls leaned forward, her expression sympathetic.\u00a0 \u201cStephen, just because your involuntary committal will likely be up tomorrow afternoon\u2026that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t stay voluntarily.\u00a0 You seem like a great guy who is having a really hard time, and we\u2019d be happy to help you through it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nStaring at her, I felt like I was teetering on the edge between giving in or screaming at her.\u00a0 Instead, I just shook my head.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m just tired.\u00a0 Sorry I wasted your time.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe nodded.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ll let you get some rest.\u00a0 And if you want to talk again, I\u2019ll be around this afternoon.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\u00a0\n\nI spent the next few hours turning everything over in my head.\u00a0 I wasn\u2019t crazy.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t believe that.\u00a0 I hadn\u2019t invented a whole life in my head where everything was the same, even Dana\u2019s number, but with a fake brother plugged into it.\u00a0 But arguing things like that wouldn\u2019t convince anyone of anything, because my parents, or whatever they were, had eaten Mark and erased him from the world.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd they wanted to do the same to me.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI suddenly sat up in bed, wiping at my cheeks as I got up and went to the door.\u00a0 Outside I saw Gertie trundling along with the first of the lunch carts.\u00a0 \u201cGertie!\u00a0 Miss Gertie!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe looked up with an affable smile.\u00a0 \u201cYes?\u00a0 Do you need something?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI nodded, heart hammering in my chest as I returned her smile.\u00a0 \u201cI do, if you don\u2019t mind.\u00a0 Can you get Dr. Smalls a message for me?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe frowned and then gave a nod.\u00a0 \u201cSure, young man.\u00a0 What is it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTell her I\u2019ve changed my mind.\u00a0 If she can get them here in the morning, I\u2019d really like for my parents to come for a

Fires in the area have been keeping me pretty busy so its been a second since Ive been back to the tower. I usually wouldn't come down from the tower but the fires are extremely close and its all hands on deck. We finally stopped the main fire so I have some time to myself. Thanks to all of you out there for messaging me on my last post. A lot of good ideas for me this time around. \n\nIve been gone for about seventeen days now on fire duty. I camped with a crew of three others, Moe, Jc, and Miranda. It was about night six when strange things started to happen. Jc woke up in a cold sweat screaming at the top of his lungs \"IM SORRY IM SORRY IM SORRY IM SORRY\" over and over again until Moe could shake him out of it. It shook us up pretty bad as well but that was just the beginning. The next night it happened again but Jc wasn't in his tent this time. His screaming was coming Forty feet away in the woods now. The same horrible thing he was screaming last night. When we found him he was weeping into his hands begging us not to let the man take him. We looked at each other and goosebumps formed on my body. When we snapped him out of it he had no recollection of what just happened in fact he asked us what was going on when he finally looked at us.\n\nThe next morning we called In for medical to come get Jc out of there for his own good. We weren't sure what was going on but he was in no state to keep watch with us. Nothing for three days and then Moe started to act funny. I woke up to take a piss and noticed Moe's tent was open. I looked around and seen no trace of him. I called out with reluctance not knowing what I was calling out to in the dark exactly. I stood there for a few minutes waiting to hear anything but it was silent as a library. There were no sounds whatsoever. No crickets, no owls, no nothing, and out here that's not a good sign. I zipped up my pants and turned back to my tent. I turned around and noticed Moe standing in front of his tent with his head down. \"Moe\" I called out but no reply. I walked over to him and put my hand on his shoulder. When he turned towards me his face looked different. Eyes white, face stretch and mouth agape.  I stepped backwards in terror and fell onto my butt.\n\nI jumped to my feet and looked back at Moe. His face was completely normal and now he just had a look of confusion on his face. \"What are you doing\" He asked. I asked him what was wrong and he said nothing, he had just got up to go to the bathroom like I had. I didn't mention his face to anyone. I just chalked it up to late night hallucinations. I went back to my tent and laid around for an hour or so with that face stuck in my head. Over the next few days there was a shift in the teams mood. Over the course of these fifteen days we went from happy, helpful, and kind to standoffish, mean, and rude. Not to mention no one wanted anything to do with one another. I could almost feel something dark clawing at me from the woods. The feeling of a weight on my chest and the cold damp feeling in the air made it very clear to me that whatever it was probably visited me at my lookout that night. I put the feeling behind me and we got to work. \n\nOn the morning of the sixteenth day things really hit the fan. I got a call on the Sat phone from the Fire Captain that a family of 3 had gone missing and the camp was torn apart a few miles from us. I asked what they thought it was and he replied \"We have no idea but just to keep an eye out for anyone.\" At about 8 A.M I woke up to Moe and Miranda fighting about which direction we should go to place the next marker. I told them about the missing family but they continued to fight. It got so bad I had to get between them. I got everyone to calm down and we started to head back to the meet up to get picked up. No one said a single word the entire 6 mile walk to the spot. Thankfully our ride was there waiting for us and everything was starting to feel better. I got back to my lookout and got unpacked. Since Ive been back I can just feel somethings off. I haven't heard anything about Jc and still I haven't heard back about the missing family yet, I'm hoping for some good news. These woods hold onto something dark and I'm gonna find out what. Ill check back in soon.

It lasted for a long few weeks.\n\nIt started when I went to sleep one night, on a Monday.\n\nA dream. A nightmare, even.\n\nIt was strange and warped, and I don't remember it well, but it was me on the sidewalk outside of my grandparents house. I was in a third person view, but it wasn't me I was looking at\u2014a twisted version of me with white skin and black and red marks, my face blurry and unrecognizable. My view slowly advanced toward my face, but it didn't become clear or visible. Just blurry. Not me.\n\nI thought nothing of it the next morning; I've always had weird, prophetic dreams and whatnot.\n\nBut things got worse. I kept seeing your average stereotypical old man in my dreams\u2014grey hair, hunched back, black cane, dark blue jeans and a flannel shirt. He didn't say anything, just stared or was in the background of my dreams. The same exact man.\n\nThen I kept seeing triangles in my dreams. Everywhere. On a tree, someone's clothes, I mean everywhere.\n\nAnd then I saw them in real life. Outside my dreams.\n\nStars aligned in a crooked but unmistakable triangle.\n\nRoots jutting out of the ground in the formation of a triangle.\n\nIn the faint patterns of scratches on my walls; a triangle.\n\nEverywhere I looked\u2014Triangle. Triangle. Triangle.\n\nI was sick of that word. Absolutely sick of it. Dream after dream, thought after thought, those wretched connected three lines haunted me. Sometimes, they even had a line in the middle of it, like a closed eye. In my dreams, the eye would slowly open but never enough so I could see beyond the lid.\n\nI searched up what it meant. \"The Holy Trinity.\" It was a triangle, yes, meant to be a sign from God.\n\nBut this? This felt sinister. Evil. Devious. If it was from God, I wouldn't have dread after my dreams and sightings of triangles everywhere, and it most likely wouldn't be  associated with a dark, dark red. Red enough to be red, but dark enough to be mistaken as black.\n\nI'd be in a forest of pine trees in my dreams, peaceful as the birds chirped ahead and the rays of the sun danced cheerfully.\n\nBut then the chirping would come to an abrupt stop.\n\nAll sound, cut off. Later on, with eerie silence, it was replaced by an unbearably loud blaring, like a cruise ship. It wailed forever and ever, then clouds of a sinister dark red would roll in, blotting out the sun and blue sky, instead a black carpet of nothingness. Slowly but surely, outlined in a fiery orange, clean lines would slice across the sky, connecting... Aligning...\n\nTopped off with a bridged line in the center of the lines.\n\nA triangle.\n\nThe line in the center, presumably an eye, would open and spread and inside I could see unfathomable horrors. I shudder at the thought. A massive black shape (which I saw flickers of in the corner of my eye outside my dreams) charging through the forest near my house, my town, crushing anything in its path, swallowing it and replacing everything I knew and loved and cared for into a undesirable void of nothing. Pandemonium broke out. The river I swam in, the bridge above it, the same dark water my dad caught a fish for the first time in years in, trees I saw everyday, houses I saw everyday, small little shops I visited and liked, the infamous ice cream shop\u2014renovated into a void of nothing. Unlovable. Undesirable. Unremarkable. The black void flooded the planet I knew and loved and hoped to save from pollution one day. Every opportunity ripped away and every chance at feeling or seeing anything but a void black rippled away.\n\nAll hell broke out.\n\nAs the void spilled across vast fields, scaled mountains and cast a dark blanket over the oceans and rivers and everything,\n\nAll while the three-cornered shape loomed, watching me with its singular eye, filled with all negative things that could happen to me and everyone. All negative things that would happen. Had happened.\n\nEver since that one dream, I stopped seeing everything like that. Yes, I saw triangles, but not everywhere I looked anymore and no more dreams of them, no more dread, I was completely fine. Left with the confusion on what that dream meant and why I had it in the first place. Now, I get this odd lingering feeling of impending doom whenever I see a triangle. Not unbearable, but an anxious \"I have to leave\" feeling."},"83":{"title":"There\u2019s something in the night sky, and it\u2019s watching

were no gaps, but if anyone came over, that would make me look insane.\u00a0 It\u2019s occurred to me that I might be insane, but overall my life isn\u2019t that bad.\u00a0 The only reason I\u2019m writing this is to see if it\u2019s happened to anyone else.\n\nThere are two rules that I have to follow, and other than that, things are okay.\n\nOne: I can\u2019t be outside at night.\u00a0 Ever.\u00a0 For that reason, I never drive anywhere that I couldn\u2019t walk home before dark if my car died or something.\u00a0 My work is about a mile from my house.\u00a0 I always go to the same grocery store.\u00a0 There are a few nice walks within a couple of miles.\u00a0 Travel is hard, but if I get flights early in the day I can go see my parents or go to weddings or whatever.\n\nTwo: I can\u2019t be within three feet of a window at night.\u00a0 Rather than putting tape on the floor or something equally psychotic, I just have tables or other furniture that keeps me from getting too close.\u00a0 I have my bed on the opposite side of the room, and if I\u2019m feeling extra anxious, I have a child gate that fits into the window behind the curtain.\u00a0 For some reason knowing that the curtain couldn\u2019t go anywhere is comforting.\u00a0 If I put on headphones with white noise, that helps, too.\n\nFollowing those two rules, I can live a pretty normal life.\u00a0 I have to admit, not being able to go anywhere after the sun goes down has made me appreciate the mornings, and my sleep schedule is the best it\u2019s ever been.\u00a0 The one thing that I miss the most is seeing the stars, but I don\u2019t think I will again.\n\nThe first time it happened, I was 35, solo camping in Glacier National Park.\u00a0 There were plenty of other people at the campground, but I was in my own spot, in a nice forested area.\u00a0 My site was the last one on the road, near the lake, and a little isolated.\u00a0 At the time, I was very happy to have gotten it.\n\nIt was spring, and the park had just opened to cars.\u00a0 There weren\u2019t really many mosquitoes yet, so I was just outside my tent, looking at the stars, drinking a beer.\u00a0 Lake Macdonald was close to the campsite, and I had heard there could be northern lights, so I went out to the lakeshore, carrying a camping chair and wearing my unzipped sleeping bag like a shawl.\n\nThe stars were brilliant, and I could see the milky way stretching over the dark outlines of pointed mountains.\u00a0 There was no moon, but you could make your way across the gravelly shore by starlight.\u00a0 I\u2019d never experienced anything like it, even though I\u2019d been stargazing a few times.\u00a0 Pulling a beer from my six pack, I sat down in my chair, and stared up at the sky.\u00a0 It was around 11PM, which is usually when the aurora starts getting good.\n\nIt was beautiful, although faint.\u00a0 Gentle green and purple lines over the mountains, reflecting on the still water.\u00a0 Wrapped in the sleeping bag I actually dozed off, exhausted from hiking all day.\n\nThat was when it woke me up.\n\nThe northern lights were brighter, like you see in pictures.\u00a0 As stunning as it was, I only felt fear.\u00a0 Frozen in the chair, I looked up at the sky, as if something was going to come out of it.\u00a0 There was *nothing* there.\n\nIn the middle of the bright stars, surrounded by the aurora, there was a little hole, a space, that was completely black.\u00a0 It didn\u2019t have sharp edges, but everything faded toward the center of it, leaving\u2026 nothingness.\n\nGoosebumps went across my scalp, and I held perfectly still, hoping that it wouldn\u2019t notice me.\u00a0 It sounds ridiculous to say it like that, I know.\u00a0 Why would a dark spot in the sky notice me, or be sentient at all?\u00a0 Maybe it isn\u2019t, I can\u2019t really say.\u00a0 That was just how I felt.\n\nWhen the sound started, the pang of fear that went across my body actually *hurt*, as all of my muscles tensed up and I felt a panic which had only existed in childhood nightmares.\u00a0 It was deafening, a low sound that oscillated, kind of a *wub wub wub* noise.\u00a0 It felt like it went through my bones, and even terrified, I looked at the gravel around my feet and saw it shaking.\n\nI threw my sleeping bag to the ground, knocking over the chair as I started to run.\u00a0 I ran back to the campground, which still had some lights on.\u00a0 There were other people there, a flashlight or two.\u00a0 I saw the light on the bathrooms, and sprinted toward it instinctively.\u00a0 Throwing the door open, I ran into the back corner and curled into a ball, arms around my knees.\n\nThe sound was gone, but I couldn\u2019t make myself get up.\u00a0 I sat in the fluorescent lights, curled on the floor.\u00a0 After maybe half an hour, a guy came in to brush his teeth.\u00a0 He saw me on the floor and asked if I was okay.\u00a0 I asked him if he\u2019d heard a loud noise, a loud low noise.\u00a0 He said he hadn\u2019t, and asked if I was okay again.\u00a0 I knew I looked crazy, so I said that I was feeling sick and just wanted to stay close to the toilet.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure he thought I was on drugs.\u00a0 He brushed his teeth and left without saying anything else.\n\nAfter another hour or so, the concrete floor was getting uncomfortable.\n\nI thought that the whole thing must have been in my head.\u00a0 It made total sense; I was asleep, had a nightmare, and freaked out.\u00a0 I was still asleep for the sand moving part, but didn\u2019t realize it.\u00a0 If it had been real, everyone would have heard it.\u00a0 Washing my face in the sink with cold water,\u00a0 I was awake.\u00a0 Looking in the mirror, I actually laughed, thinking about how silly I had acted.\n\nWhen I opened the door and stepped back out under the night sky, there was a tension in the air, like when you\u2019re close to a big power line.\u00a0 With the outside light next to me, I couldn\u2019t make out any stars, or see the dark spot.\u00a0 But I knew it was there.\n\nThe noise started to come back, a crescendo rumbling up from silence, and I looked to the sky.\u00a0 The light on the side of the stucco building was right next to me, preventing me from seeing anything past the eaves, but I knew I wasn\u2019t dreaming it.\u00a0 There were moths around the light, and they all fell to the ground.\n\nI still had my hand on the open door, that was how fast it had happened.\u00a0 I darted back inside, breathing hard running only fifteen feet back to my spot against the wall.\u00a0 The sound went away.\n\nI spent the night there.\u00a0 A few people came and went, awkwardly ignoring me, or asking if they could help.\u00a0 I said the same thing, that my stomach was just upset and I wanted to be near the toilet.\u00a0 It was the best I could think of.\n\nOnce the sun came up, a bunch of people started coming in, both stalls were occupied, and the sinks had one or two people at each.\u00a0 In the bright morning, with birds singing and cars running and people laughing, it seemed safe.\u00a0 I opened the door.\n\nThere was no sound.\u00a0 No hole in the sky.\n\nI had two more nights but left early.\u00a0 When I got back to my house in the afternoon, I just played video games all day.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t tell anyone I\u2019d come home early, because then they might ask why, and I didn\u2019t want to talk about it or think about it or admit that it had happened.\n\nI had no desire to go outside.\u00a0 I closed all of the blinds when the sun was setting, and just drank and watched shows until about 1 AM.\u00a0 When I went to bed, I had a hard time sleeping, but eventually did.\n\nThe next day, I went to the grocery store.\u00a0 I was a bit tentative opening my door, but things were fine.\u00a0 It was a beautiful day, everything was green after about 6 months of winter, and I was feeling pretty good.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t until the sun went down that it came back.\n\nI was on my couch, next to the window, which was open.\u00a0 As the street lights flickered on, and it grew dark I felt uneasy.\u00a0 Just a little tickle of fear, like you would have as a kid imagining that something was under your bed.\u00a0 Over my left shoulder, the sky loomed through the window, and I couldn\u2019t help myself.\u00a0 I looked out.\n\nPutting my head close to the glass to look up at the dark sky, that powerful humming came back.\u00a0 The glass began to shake and I recoiled, throwing myself to the far side of the couch, then pulling my legs in as if something would break through the window and grab them.\n\nBut nothing did.\u00a0 The humming faded away.\n\nI spent the night on cushions and blankets on my bathroom floor, with the door closed.\u00a0 It\u2019s the only room in my apartment with no windows.\n\nIt had followed me.\n\nI still wonder why, every night.\u00a0 During the day, I do fine, and don\u2019t even think about it most of the time.\u00a0 It\u2019s just a part of life, like checking for cars before you cross the street.\n\nThere was only one other night, a few months later, where I even got close to a window.\u00a0 I had been drinking, a lot.\u00a0 As scared as I was, I managed to get angry.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t fair that this was happening to me, and whatever it was could just kill me or fuck off, as far as I was concerned.\u00a0 I\u2019d left the living room window open, and gathered up my courage before walking up to it.\n\nThe sound came.\u00a0 I gritted my teeth, said I would stand my ground no matter what.\n\nBut it got louder.\u00a0 And louder.\u00a0 And louder, that *wub wub wub wub* drilling into my brain, causing a fear like I never knew a sound could.\u00a0 I fell back, crawling away from the window, from the black night sky, until it disappeared.\u00a0 I sobbed after that.\u00a0 Sometimes, I still cry when I think about it.\n\nNot knowing is the worst part.\u00a0 Having no idea what it is, why it wants me.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m crazy.\u00a0 I\u2019m considering going to therapy, even though I really don\u2019t believe that it could help.\n\nBut I have no doubt that if anyone else has heard it, they will know what I\u2019m talking about immediately.\u00a0 So now, at risk of sounding insane, I\u2019ll ask:\n\nHas anyone else heard it?\n\n[...More](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/patrickmullensauthor\/comments\/1kern3o\/patrick_mullens_written_work\/)"},"84":{"title":"I thought I was just doing a job, until I realized we were building a machine to look backward in

a job as \u201cChief Security Officer\u201d at a software development company.\u00a0\n\nThey didn\u2019t have much use for cybersecurity personnel at that point, as most security affairs were taken care of by artificial intelligence. But I was present for almost anything that involved the company\u2019s simulation servers, just as a last resort. Basically, I was there to make sure the AI didn\u2019t bug out.\n\nOne day, we were working on a new physics engine. This engine was honestly mind blowing. It could simulate hundreds of factors at once. For example, just walking or running in a game, this engine understood the slight alterations in speed depending on the gravity, torque, momentum, friction, and even the way vibrations would travel through the skeleton upon exerting force into the ground. It used these factors, combined with the muscle mass, height, bone density and age of the character walking to create an almost indistinguishable-from-reality simulation of walking. All of this, built from the atomic level up. And it didn\u2019t stop with walking.\u00a0\n\nWe were working on a specific simulation so we could roll out the engine to sports games. I remember it so distinctly. It was just a man hitting a baseball. We were using a combination of AI and engineers, watching different scans, audio and video recordings of real-life baseball, attempting to isolate all of the different variables. There were some easy ones. The strength, the angle, the wind. But even with these variables stagnant, the ball was never landing in the same exact place twice. Finally, we thought we had found the culprit. There were slight atomic variations when it came to the angle. It was seemingly impossible for a batter to hit a ball the exact same way twice, even if it appeared as if they did to the naked eye. After realizing this and tweaking everything accordingly, it still didn\u2019t work. We realized shortly after that the way we were generating the baseball was important as well, as no two baseballs are exactly the same. We had some slight variations in the material make-up of the balls to keep it more realistic when playing a game, but for the purpose of this simulation, we needed every ball to be microscopically identical. Identical balls, bats, identical atomic angles.\n\nNow, finally we could run the simulation. And it worked. The batter would hit the ball 101.3m away from home plate. The ball would bounce twice, and land with the logo facing up. Every. Single. Time. Sitting from the back and watching this simulation take place, something came into my mind. A stupid question, really. I decided to ask one of the engineers, someone who had been friendly with me since I started working here.  \n  \n\u201cHey man.. So, we know all of these variables, probably hundreds of data points by now, that cause the ball to land in this exact position, right?\u201d  \n  \n\u201cI mean yeah, that\u2018s the whole point.\u201d He replied, looking up from his monitor.  \n  \n\u201cSo, what if we just had the ball?\u201d I asked, realizing how silly it might have sounded.  \n  \n\u201cThen it wouldn\u2019t go anywhere?\u201d He said, looking back down at his monitor.  \n  \n\u201cNo, I mean, look, imagine the ball has already been hit. And we don\u2019t have access to the ball being hit. Just where it landed. Could we, like, predict, or I guess, figure out exactly, what all those variables were that allowed the ball to land exactly where it was, and how it landed?\u201d  \n  \n\u201cOh uh, yeah\u201d said the engineer, now with some mild interest. \u201cYeah we probably could. We\u2019d just have to reverse the process. Run a bunch of simulations until we figured it out. I don\u2019t know how useful that would be for the engine, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe not for the engine. But what if we trained it on, I don\u2019t know, a boat that sank to the bottom of the ocean. Could the engine, like, figure out how, when, and why the boat sank, where it was, et cetera?\u201d I asked, realizing the absurdity of my hypothesis but unable to figure out why it wouldn\u2019t work.   \n\u201cIf we think about it, the ball being thrown has maybe a hundred variables, and the boat sinking maybe has ten thousand, but we already know how powerful this engine is\u2026 I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m--\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re right.\u201d The engineer cut me off. \u201cWe would just need to train it enough on real world physics. How it all interacts. Radio and sonar scans, videos, everything we can get. It\u2019s way too big a job for us engineers, but I bet the AI could do it. I just don\u2019t see a reason they would sink that much money into it right now.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThinking about all of this, I had a thought, one that was so absurd, but again, I couldn\u2019t understand why it wouldn\u2019t work.   \n\u201cTell me, why wouldn\u2019t we be able to.. Train it on a person? If it\u2019s all just atoms moving around, bumping into each other. That\u2019s all everything is, really, at its core. And our engine already knows how to simulate physics on an atomic level. It should, theoretically, be able to figure out why a person is the way that they are, physically and in terms of personality, just by observing them at the present moment\u2026 If we could figure out the path of a baseball, or a boat, then why not a person?\u00a0 There\u2019s only one distinct path they could have taken to be exactly the way they are right now. What if we could simulate exactly what that path must be?\u201d   \n  \nI paused for a minute. I knew what I was about to say sounded crazy.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt would basically be time travel, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cTime travel? Well.. I don\u2019t know about-- wait.. No, yeah, you\u2019re right. It would be. With enough power, we could map out a person\u2019s past. Well, theoretically, I think we could map out everyone\u2019s past. Just from a small group of people, or maybe even one. A person should have a complex enough backstory, enough interactions that depend on other interactions, interactions that must have taken place exactly how they did for the person to take this distinct path.. Enough specific interactions that we could just scan one person, and get everyone\u2019s whole lives, our whole lives. In a simulation. Now that\u2019s a monetary incentive to get the higher-ups on board.\u201d  \n  \nFrom one person? That didn\u2019t make sense to me. But then it hit. What if we mapped out the path of the baseball, but didn\u2019t stop at the baseball being hit by the bat? We could gather data on the intensity of the pitch, the state of the bat, the wind, the climate, the crowd. With this data, we could figure out a rough estimate of the build of the batter and the pitcher. We could figure out where it\u2019s taking place. Now imagine if we had a million more variables. A person, instead of a baseball. We could get so much information about so much more.\n\nBewildered at the chain of thoughts I had sparked, unaware of what would come of it, I said \u201cNot just our lives, but, the whole fucking universe since the beginning of time.\u201d"},"85":{"title":"Don\u2019t eat don\u2019t sleep the kitchens hungry","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kfve63\/dont_eat_dont_sleep_the_kitchens_hungry\/","flair":null,"author":"jollyrancher4459","selftext":"  Did you know that according to the CDC, 55% of people in the food and service industry kill themselves a year? I\u2019ve thought about it a few times. I hate this life, I've given far too much of it to something that at the moment felt so important, so crucial, and then woke up one day and none of it mattered. I started so enthusiastic, so full of life. I just wanted to make something of myself, to be important.\n\n   I fell into my first kitchen job, I was hopeless, almost homeless, and all I wanted to do was find a purpose, anything. That's when a friend of a friend offered me a position as a dishwasher at a local diner. Diner food isn't the finest of cuisine, but I watched the cooks work and it looked easier than dishwashing and paid a whole lot more so I jumped at the first opportunity to get on the line. Since then I've been hopping between better and better places honing my craft. \n\n   When you cook, time is a commodity. In the loud cacophony of clinks, tickets printing, and yelling, time is my only companion. My only guide towards the perfect result. I hold great pride in that, in my time. I wear a watch on the line for the sole purpose of keeping up with my times, pushing myself to be faster, and better. I raise blinders to the world and run my hand with grace through the space which I am allotted. Time and the efficiency at which I had used it was my only refuge, now it's my prison. \n\n   I\u2019ve always been pretty intuitive. That video where they tell you to count how many times a ball is thrown and then at the end ask if you saw the gorilla, I always saw the gorilla. Since the first day I set foot in a kitchen, I always felt something was strange. There's a shadow over all kitchens, something that looms over us. I always thought it was just the pressure, long hours with no breaks, being yelled at, constantly told you're not good enough, it affects your soul. The side effects of working in a kitchen affect some more than others but when they hit they hit. \n\n   It may just be years of drug and alcohol abuse but I swear some cooks just have a look and feel about em\u2019. They'll look ten years older than they should, have huge bags under their eyes, really just looking disheveled in general. Like they've given up. And then every now and then you\u2019ll meet someone who just pisses you off by the way they are. They'll have been there for years for some reason, someone so stupid and far gone you\u2019d have a hard time even picturing a version of them that wasn't so horrible to be around.\n\n   I always promised myself I wouldn't be one of those people, engulfed by the job, just a husk walking around. I thought I could maintain, just continue being me, a kind, happy guy, who loves his job. It's been fifteen years now, I've broken the promise. I had some friends but they all moved away, got married, or just lost interest in me I guess. I never found anyone to love. I\u2019ve had a few one-night stands come home from the bar but no one seems to want to be with a guy like me. A cook, a loser. So all I do is work now. I have two jobs and no life. I hate it but It pays\n\n  Today as I was leaving work I noticed something strange. The time on my watch was three minutes ahead of the time on the time clock. I was a tad bit perturbed by the notion it was wrong as I hadn\u2019t hit any of the buttons on my watch on accident that day, I\u2019m sure I would have heard the little beep it would\u2019ve made. But I checked my phone and it said the same thing. I do work in a hectic environment as a cook so it isn't unreasonable that I could have bumped it into something by accident. But then it happened again the next day, and this time it was ten minutes. Now three times is a hard to believe number of hitting your wrist without knowing, but believable nevertheless. \n \n   There is absolutely no way I could have bumped my wrist into anything ten times and not noticed. And it was an extremely slow day at that so there would have been no opportunities to have even done so. \u201cWelp, my watch is broken,\u201d I thought. So I bought a new one at the gas station the next day and thought nothing of it. Think of my surprise when, you guessed it, my brand new watch does the exact same thing the next day. But this time the time clock was a whole hour behind my watch.\n     \n   Now, I know that my watch isn't malfunctioning, today was an exceptionally slow day and I paid expert attention to the watch, comparing it with my phone's time. It passed the test, every hour, on the hour, it showed the correct time. But when I got to that machine a whole hour somehow slipped from underneath me. I quickly pulled my phone from my pocket and it confirmed that my watch was a whole hour ahead of time. \n\n   No, this can't be, I refuse to believe that my phone which confirmed while walking up to this machine that the time was correct on my watch, is now somehow a whole hour behind sed watch. This is insane. And then I realized, I have to go back to work now, for another whole hour. \n    \n  \u201cWhere the fuck have you been,\u201d yelled my chef, pissed off that I had left in the middle of an apparent rush. \u201cSorry chef, somethings up with my watch. It said it was ten already.\u201d I said defeated. \u201cThere's a clock on the wall dumbass, stop fucking around,\u201d he said sternly. I didn't want to test him so I hurried back to my station. \u201cDude what the fuck,\u201d said Jim. \u201cI had to do that whole table by myself, pay attention,\u201d he said exasperated as if the whole dining room had been ordering from the station I had left behind. \n\n   I looked up at the dining room and in fact, there was no one there. \u201cWhere'd everyone go?\u201d I said. \u201cThey left before you got here,\u201d he said in a hurry to get back to his station. He scurried off to his side of the line, resorting himself to an upside-down bucket and the videos on his phone.\n     \n   I looked at Jim for a moment, that guy,  he sorta disgusted me. Short and fat, his eyes never looked at you at the same time, and his mouth was always disgustingly sopping wet. Sometimes he just stares off into the distance, drool swinging from his engorged moist bottom lip. I hate everything that man stands for. Everything he does is an affront to me. He never works, he just acts like he does. He\u2019ll pick up a broom just to sweep dirt around, never to pick it up with a dustpan. All to avoid doing his actual job, which is cooking. \n      \n   But I prefer it that way, because when he actually cooks, he does it like a disgusting slob who shouldn't be allowed within a hundred feet of a kitchen. Constant cross contamination, shells in eggs, undercooked chickens, broken sauces, and rice that is both burnt and undercooked. This man is an anomaly. But Chef refuses to fire him. I\u2019ll never know why. \n     \n   There is nothing in the world I want more than to go home at this moment. In defeat, I lean onto my workstation looking at the mess Jim made. Since I had thought my shift was over I wrapped all of my pans up. And of course, that sack of shit Jim plopped his greasy little hands through the plastic instead of unwrapping them. I looked at him in disgust, he was picking his nose now. Paying me no mind. \u201cWhatever,\u201d I said under my breath. I rewrapped all the exposed pans, wiped up all the oil and sauce Jim had sloppily drizzled my station with, and resigned myself to my own makeshift seat. \n      \n   I glanced at my watch out of habit. What I saw confused me. Since the last time I had attempted to clock out, three more hours had, according to my watch, gone by. That couldn't have been possible, it couldn't have been but six minutes since I did that. I looked at my Phone to confirm. I knew it was impossible but I still had this sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach like there was something wrong. And, to my chagrin, there definitely was something wrong. My phone confirmed it.\n      \n   Now I figured at this point I had a few options. I could either ignore this, act like nothing happened and just leave when I feel like an hour had gone by. Or, I could try and clock out now. For a second I gave in, took a breath, and sat back to think. Maybe I am overthinking this, maybe both my phone and my watch are broken, maybe this is all in my head.\n\n   Then I looked at my phone. It said it was five o\u2019clock in the morning, the next day. A shock ran down my spine with a violence shaking me as it passed down my vertebrae. I shot up. \u2018No, this can\u2019t, I\u2019m not crazy!\u2019 I thought. My mind raced as I ran to the break room.\n      \n   That little tablet, that black box hanging on the wall. It had the exact same time on it as when I had last checked it. My mouth hung agape, my eyes bulged, and I laughed. Not even a minute had gone by since I had checked it. I calmed myself, I took a breath and I rationalized. It\u2019s a rare occasion but everything must just have been broken at the same time.\n      \n   Chuckling to myself I turned around and walked down the hallway to the chef's office. What was waiting for me at the end of that hallway still haunts me. As I began to reach the end of the passage, I heard something. I heard the voices of a full dining room, the sound of conversation and forks clicking on porcelain. And as I rounded the corner to look out on this supposedly full dining room. I was met with nothing. And when I say nothing I mean void. \n\n   No light, no sound. The only detectable feeling being a breeze, a hot sticky breath from the maw of nothingness. I tried to look away but It followed my gaze. Something licked my hand. I jerked my arm back only to trip on myself and fall into the void. Something caught me. It grabbed my arms and legs outstretching them, the back of my neck was met with a tongue and hot breath to match the dank that now encapsulated me. \n      \n   Then I opened my eyes. I was sprawled out on the floor. I instinctively gripped the back of my neck. It was dry but I could still sense what had happened as if I was being forced to remember every second. I shifted into a fetal position, vomit slid from my mouth as I lay shivering. After a few minutes of suffering, I heard movement in front of me. I opened my eyes and lifted my head only to see the foot of my chef crashing down at me, and then nothing. \n      \n   When I woke up I was in the chef's office, tied to a chair. The vomit on my mouth had dried. My chef sat across his desk staring at me with a blank expression. He looked down as he began to speak, \u201cyou\u2019ve seen it now, and he\u2019s seen you,\u201d he said in a soft voice that I\u2019d never heard him use. \u201cChef what\u2019s going on,\u201d I said, still in a daise. \u201cHe\u2019s kissed you on the neck, he wants you,\u201d he said in a whisper. \n\n   \u201cChef what the fuck,\u201d I screamed. Just then he slouched down, his head almost meeting his stomach and his arm limp at his side. I leaned back trying to escape his aura. His head shot back up hitting the desk on its way with a loud clunk, blood splattered on the wall behind him and he screamed as loud as he could. His eyes rolled into the back of his skull exposing the full whites of his eyes, he was fully erect, the veins on his neck looked as if they were to explode. \n\n   Tears were streaming down the sides of his face, his skin turning purple. His throat started to hiss and gurgle. \u201c DONT EAT DONT SLEEP HE WANTS YOU.\u201d whined from his ragged vocals for about three minutes as I watched on in horror. Then his body went limp, his head hit the desk with a loud crunch, and then his body the floor. And I could do nothing but look at him and his lifeless body and cry as the lights in the room flickered and a darkness crept in on me from the corners of my eyes.\n      \n   I raised my shoulders up against my cold exposed neck and struggled with my bindings. With tears streaming down my cheeks I cried so hard that I couldn\u2019t breathe, my lungs shocked with every gulp of air. The only thing I could think to do was close my eyes and wait for the inevitable defilement. As I sit there waiting I feel the hot stinking breath of my horror. And then I heard a click.\n\n   I open my eyes with relief to see the room I\u2019m in is how it should be. I look behind me to see Jim poking through the door staring at me. \u201cHey,\u201d I said looking back at him.  \u201cStop being so loud,\u201d he said. Even now, even when he was the only thing that could save me, I couldn't be patient with him. \u201cGet over here and help me,\u201d I yelled. He opened the door all the way and looked at me, just standing there staring. At first, I had a rush of anger but then it was followed by fear. I was helpless, tied up, and injured.\n\n   He knew I didn\u2019t like him, that I hated him. Right now he could hurt me, or worse, and I have no mode of action to stop it. My breath fastened and my eyes widened at the implication. He took a step forward, a whimper left my mouth as air involuntarily escaped past my vocal cords. I could feel the muscles in my throat tense and bulge into my mouth, my neck was sore from the stress. \n\n  As he got closer a bead of sweat ran down my forehead landing on my lips. He reached my side and bent down to my ear, my body stretched away from him, but he leaned in closer, his disgusting stomach rubbing my bond arm and his hand on the desk for support. \n\n   His breath stank of rot and his breath\u2019s moisture stung my ear with every hot gross pronunciation. \u201cI was like you once. You can leave but he\u2019ll have you, and you\u2019ll be like me.\u201d I turned to him with a scowl. He looked back at me with indifference in one eye and the other towards the distance. His mouth agape, only closing to slurp down the disgusting slobber pooling in his mouth. Then he got up, pulled a knife from his pocket, and cut me loose. Then he sombered off disappearing into the now pitch black hallway.\n\n   I looked down at Chef, blood had started squirting from his head onto my leg. My eyes widened and I ran to the bathroom. I wet some towels and scrubbed my legs until my hands were numb. I cried a lot, Chef wasn't the best but he didn't deserve whatever that was. I started breaking down, I couldn't handle it. I tried to stand up but fell back to my knees. I beat the floor in frustration, then began beating my fists on my head. \n\n   Once I ran out of energy I gathered myself and rose to my feet. Rinsing my face with water I started to calm. Then I looked up, pain filled my chest, and horror my heart. It looked as if my face had swollen but it wasn't red. Then in horror, I watched as my face shifted. Bumps moving beneath my skin molding my face into something new. I dug at my visage, ripping my skin, pulling at my flesh. I fell to the floor arching my back, rolling in a struggle towards myself. I started running, my feet slipping on my own blood. I had to leave. \n\n   I didn\u2019t bother clocking out this time. I drove straight home in silence. When I got home I went to my bathroom and looked into the mirror. Nothing was moving, my face wasn\u2019t swollen, there were just scratches and tears from my own hands. I sat down in my chair and I screamed and cried and beat my head with my fists until I fell asleep. And then in the middle of the night, I woke up to a warm, dank, breath on my face. I shot up. I wasn\u2019t there, but I think at some point I was. \n\n   Again I cried, and I decided something. Whatever it is that lives beyond time in that void, whatever wants me. It can\u2019t have me. I won't be like Jim, I\u2019ve already begun to forget things. I haven't eaten, I haven't slept. If it doesn\u2019t already have me, it will, so I\u2019m going to kill myself. I just want someone to believe me before I die, and to warn others. Don't let your life slip by, don't let it consume you.\n"},"86":{"title":"I stayed the night at my crazy uncle\u2019s place.

Ours shows up each Thanksgiving. Trucker hat. Worn shirt. Faded jeans. We get to listen to his diatribes about the economy, the fake moon landing, and how Big Brother is trying to kill us with weather manipulation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not natural,\u201d he says, clutching a turkey drumstick. \u201cThose white streaks in the sky. It\u2019s population control. Someone\u2019s got to do something about it.\u201d\n\nTypically, these conversations only last a few minutes. My family has learned the art of distracting him with questions, like, \u201cSo, Uncle Hank, how\u2019s the new boat? Are you enjoying retirement? Did you get your hip looked at?\u201d\n\nBut this last time, several Thanksgivings ago, it got really bad. Uncle Hank had a little too much to drink, got on one of his rampages, and wouldn\u2019t stop. \n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s cooking up another virus!\u201d He shouted. \u201cIt\u2019ll make Ebola look like the flu. It\u2019ll go airborne and wipe out 70% of the population! We\u2019ve gotta rise up!\u201d\n\nHis tirade started to make Grandma sob. She had just lost Grandpa and was still processing her grief. Dad shifted in his seat, pissed, then leapt up. \n\n\u201cEnough!\u201d He said and escorted Uncle Hank out of the room.\n\n\u201cListen! I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Hank apologized. But Dad led him outside and slammed the door.\n\nI didn\u2019t see much of him after that. But then, a few years later, my girlfriend, Vanessa, and I had to drive south to tour her new university. She had just been accepted to a Master\u2019s Program and wanted to check out the campus. I was so proud.\n\nWe were navigating an isolated road when our GPS stopped working. Before long, our car ended up in the middle of a forested backroad, surrounded by darkness.\n\n\u201cSee anything?\u201d Vanessa asked, checking for road signs.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, craning my eyes. The sunlight was vanishing. Then\u2026 \n\n\u2026the car shuddered. Violently. \n\n\u201cShit!\u201d\n\nI pulled over and parked. \n\nSmoke billowed out from the hood as Vanessa and I got out. It was so cold the air clung to our skin. We pulled our jackets close. \n\nI didn\u2019t have a flashlight, so Vanessa held her phone over me as I peered under the hood. I couldn\u2019t see what was wrong. \n\nI called the tow truck company. They told me they couldn\u2019t be there until the next day.\n\n\u201cDamn.\u201d I turned to Vanessa, cold air biting my skin. \u201cLooks like we\u2019re stuck here for the night.\u201d\n\nShe buried her hands in her pockets. Shivering. \u201cDo you know anyone here?\u201d\n\nI frowned as I thought, \u201cYeah, I know someone.\u201d\n\nI made the call. \n\nIt was about an hour later when Uncle Hank\u2019s truck appeared down the road. He pulled up behind my car and stepped out, wearing his signature cowboy boots.\n\n\u201cWheewwee.\u201d Uncle Hank whistled. \u201cWhat have we got here?\u201d\n\n\u201cHi, Uncle Hank.\u201d \n\nI offered my hand to shake his. But he just gave me a big bear-hug. You know, the kind that feels like your ribs are about to break. Then, he turned to Vanessa. \n\n\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d \n\n\u201cVanessa,\u201d she said and shook his hand. \u201cThanks for saving us.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy pleasure. It\u2019s what anyone would do for family.\u201d \n\nHank turned and peered inside my vehicle. He couldn\u2019t figure out what was wrong either.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cWell, looks like the mechanic will have to sort this out.\u201d He dusted off his hands on his pants. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay over at my place? I\u2019ll drive you to the shop in the morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019d be great, Uncle Hank.\u201d\n\nVanessa and I got our bags. Left the keys in my car. Climbed into Uncle Hank\u2019s truck and drove off. \n\nWe were in the cab for about five minutes when Uncle Hank cleared his throat. \u201cSo, where\u2019d you two meet?\u201d\n\n\u201cUniversity,\u201d I said. \n\n\u201cAhhhh.\u201d He leaned over, made eye contact with Vanessa. \u201cUniversities are for brainwashing. Lizard people use them as tools for indoctrination.\u201d\n\n\u201cLizard people?\u201d She said. \n\n\u201cThey rule the world.\u201d \n\nShe just nodded. I could tell she was uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cBest way to tell a Lizard Person is to \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, Uncle Hank,\u201d I piped in. \u201cHow\u2019s your boat running?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that old thing?\u201d He thought. \u201cBoat\u2019s fine. But the damn thing keeps breaking down. Just last weekend\u2026\u201d \n\nI smiled and relaxed, satisfied my question had diverted him. \n\nAbout thirty minutes later, we were at his place. It was a small squat building in the back end of nowhere. There wasn\u2019t another house for miles. \n\n\u201cCome on in,\u201d he said and held the door open for us. \u201cDon\u2019t break anything or I\u2019ll murder you.\u201d \n\nVanessa and I looked at each other, disturbed by his off-putting joke. \n\n\u201cJust kidding!\u201d He said and pointed to a room down the hall. \u201cYou lovebirds can take the guest room.\u201d \n\nHe signaled to another. \u201cThere\u2019s the bathroom. Master bedroom\u2019s around the corner. If you hear any strange noises, don\u2019t come looking for me.\u201d\n\nVanessa and I looked at each other: \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll let you two get unpacked. Goodnight.\u201d He disappeared around the corner as I helped Vanessa move our bags to the guest room.\n\nA few minutes later, Vanessa went to the bathroom to get ready for bed. I stored our stuff in the closet and Uncle Hank popped in. \u201cPssst. Tommy.\u201d \n\n\u201cYes, Uncle Hank?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour girlfriend. Is she a\u2026 Flat Earther?\u201d\n\n\u201cA what?\u201d\n\n\u201cFlat Earther. Like, does she believe the earth is round or \u2014?\u201d\n\nHe made a horizontal motion with his hands. I thought the question was strange, but I humored him. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Uncle Hank. I\u2019ll have to ask her.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease do.\u201d\n\nHe just stood there, looking at me. I prayed the awkward moment would pass, but it kept going. Finally, the sound of cascading water hit our ears. Vanessa must\u2019ve started the shower. \n\n\u201cWell, I better hit the hay.\u201d Uncle Hank wrapped his knuckles on the door. \u201cYou lovebirds get some sleep. And remember, you hear any strange noises, don\u2019t come knocking.\u201d\n\nThe repeated comment creeped me out, but I shrugged it off. It was one night. How bad could it be? \n\n\u201cOkay, Uncle Hank.\u201d \n\nHe wandered into the hall. Footsteps pattering. I heard a door close and thanked God he was gone.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nA few hours later, I flopped into bed next to Vanessa. Both dressed and ready for sleep. I held her hand as I drifted off. \n\nLater that night\u2014God only knows when\u2014I felt someone stir me awake.\n\nIt was Vanessa.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cTom!\"\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d I sat up and rubbed the grogginess from my eyes.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s your uncle\u2026\u201d\n\nI heard a loud moan come from the hall. Desperate. Pleading. Like someone was having a violent seizure.\n\nI sat up and listened. Another agonizing squeal erupted from his bedroom, like a person was being eaten alive.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d Vanessa said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I scrambled up and went to the door.\n\nAnother painful groan.\n\n\u201cIs your uncle okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he is.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sounds like he\u2019s dying.\u201d\n\nThe screams grew louder. Then, a gasp of pain. Almost sob-like. \n\n\u201cOh my god, Tom, do something!\u201d \n\n\u201cHe told us to leave him alone!\u201d \n\n\u201cJust make sure he\u2019s alright!\u201d \n\nThe groans turned into a series of belly-wrenching screams. I ventured out of the room.\n\n\u201cAh, god! Help me! Help!\u201d It was Uncle Hank. Wailing in misery.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI raced to his bedroom door. Pounded on it. \n\n\u201cUncle Hank?! What\u2019s going on in there?\u201d \n\nAnother loud scream. I twisted the knob. It was locked. \n\n\u201cGod, no! Help me! Ah\u2026\u201d His voice sounded shell-shocked, entreating. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming in!\u201d\n\nI backed up and slammed my shoulder into the door. BANG. Then again. BANG. \n\n\u201cHelp me! Ah\u2026\u201d\n\nFinally, I broke through\u2026\n\n\u2026 Uncle Hank\u2019s bedroom was dark except for a sliver of moonlight peering through the window. \n\nHank was sitting on the edge of his bed. Gasping. \n\nAnd something\u2026 small, no bigger than a bulldog\u2026 was sitting on his shoulders. Whispering into his ears.\n\n\u201cNo, please\u2026 I can\u2019t take any more\u2026\u201d Hank begged. \n\nThe shape\u2019s voice sounded eerie and soft, almost seductive. But I couldn\u2019t tell what it was saying.\n\n\u201cPlease\u2026 no more\u2026\u201d \n\nI crept back. Trying to rationalize the situation\u2026\n\n\u201cYour lies\u2026 hurt so much\u2026\u201d\n\nThen, my voice slipped out of my throat. It must\u2019ve been a gut reaction to all the insanity. As soon as the words came, I wanted to pull them back in: \u201cUncle Hank, are you alright?\u201d\n\nUncle Hank turned. His voice was cold, menacing, \u201cI told you not to come in.\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d \n\nHe leapt off his bed. Dashing toward me.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI tried getting away. But he grabbed my arm. Slapped a sweaty palm over my lips. Pinned me against the wall.\n\nI squirmed, trying to break free. But his grip was strong. \n\nUncle Hank leaned in close. His breath hot against my face. \u201cYou should\u2019ve listened to me, Tommy.\u201d\n\nI nodded, begging to be let go.\n\nThe weird shape was still atop his shoulders. Whispering. It was so dark I couldn\u2019t tell what it was. But it had glowing yellow eyes. And the smell\u2026 uh\u2026 I can\u2019t even describe it.\n\n\u201cYou must not tell anyone what you\u2019ve seen.\u201d Uncle Hank said. \n\nI was so scared. What was even happening?! I just nodded. Sweat pouring down my face. \n\nUncle Hank removed his hand and backed away. \u201cGo to bed, Tommy.\u201d\n\nI bobbed my head. Stumbled back into the hall, my mind swirling. \n\nI staggered to our bedroom. Leapt inside. Shut the door. \n\nVanessa just stared at me from the bed, white-knuckling her comforter. \u201cWhat happened?!\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeriously, Tom, what was it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d \n\n\u201cIs he alright?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you!\u201d\n\nI just flopped in bed, silent, not wanting to make any more noise. \n\n\u201cWhy won\u2019t you tell me?!\u201d\n\n\u201cTrust me\u2026 I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nVanessa frowned and turned away. I sank back into my sheets, delirious, hoping to disappear. \n\nNeedless to say\u2026 \n\n\u2026 I didn\u2019t sleep much that night. \n\nNext morning, I could hear Uncle Hank whistling through the house. Getting ready for the day. \n\nFive minutes later, he knocked on our door. \u201cYou kids want something to eat?\u201d\n \nVanessa and I had just finished packing. We were both dressed and ready to go. \u201cNo thanks.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright. Come on out when you\u2019re ready and I\u2019ll drive you over.\u201d\n\nNot long after, Uncle Hank had shuttled us to the shop. We got to our car. Told the mechanic about our problems. Case closed.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nUncle Hank pulled me aside after I had finished talking with the mechanic. \u201cNow, listen, Tommy, about last night.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. We don\u2019t need to talk about it \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no\u2026 I need to apologize. You see, I\u2019ve got this cat.\u201d \n\nA cat?!\n\n\u201cSometimes when I get scared, it comes to me and sits on my shoulder. It tells me things to comfort me.\u201d\n\nI just stood there, not knowing what to say. \n\n\u201cLast night, it was telling me about my past\u2026\u201d\n\nUncle Hank\u2019s voice drifted away as my mind blocked out his words. \n\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d he slapped a hand on my shoulder, reassuring me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for overreacting. Let\u2019s keep this between us, alright?\u201d \n\n\u201cOkay, Uncle Hank.\u201d \n\nHe hiked back to his truck, waving goodbye to Vanessa. \u201cTake care of my nephew!\u201d\n\n\u201cWill do!\u201d She waved. Grateful to see him going.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nUncle Hank got in his truck. Backed out. And merged onto the road.\n\nVanessa frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re still not going to tell me what happened?!\u201d \n\nI just shrugged. How could I? I didn\u2019t even know what had happened. \n\nMy eyes glanced back to Uncle Hank\u2019s truck as it shrank in the distance.\n\nIn the rear window, I could barely notice \u2014 \n\n\u2014 a small, bulldog-sized creature perched upon his shoulders\u2026 its yellow eyes focused on me\u2026\n\nI had no idea what it was\u2026 but I knew this\u2026\n\n\u2026 it sure as hell wasn\u2019t a cat."},"87":{"title":"The Room That Wasn't There","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kfe6rx\/the_room_that_wasnt_there\/","flair":null,"author":"Amko06","selftext":"You ever notice something in your house that\u2026 wasn\u2019t? A corner that feels colder. A shadow that bends wrong. Maybe a door you swear didn\u2019t used to be there.\n\nMine appeared on a Tuesday.\n\nI live in a two-bedroom apartment. One bedroom, one office. Always been that way. I work from home, no pets, no guests. Just me. But when I walked past the hallway that afternoon, there it was: a door on the left wall. Same color, same handle. Perfectly normal. Only problem? That wall\u2019s *never* had a door.\n\nI stood frozen. Just stared. I even took out my phone to check old pictures. Wall\u2019s empty in every single one.\n\nSo obviously I did the stupid thing: I opened it.\n\nIt was a room. Small. Empty. Dustless. Windowless. The air was warm, still. The floorboards were the same as the rest of the apartment, but\u2026 newer? Like freshly installed. The ceiling light flicked on automatically, humming softly.\n\nI stepped inside. Just for a second.\n\nWhen I stepped out again, it was night.\n\nI checked my phone: *3:42 a.m.*\n\nI\u2019d lost over ten hours.\n\nI tried to convince myself I fell asleep, blacked out, whatever. But the next morning, the room was still there. And something was in it.\n\nA *chair*.\n\nNot like one I own. This one was old. Victorian maybe. Ornate carvings. Crimson velvet, worn down to threads in spots. And on the chair\u2014*a single Polaroid*.\n\nIt was of me. Standing in the room. But I never took that photo.\n\nI slammed the door shut, locked it, pushed a bookshelf in front of it. I didn\u2019t sleep.\n\nThe next morning, I pushed the shelf aside.\n\nThe room had changed.\n\nNow there were *three* Polaroids. Me sitting. Me looking up in confusion. And the third\u2014*me screaming*.\n\nOver the next week, the room *grew*.\n\nSlowly. By inches. A side table one day. A coat rack the next. Every day, something was different. The lightbulb began to flicker. The air smelled like rotting wood. The photos multiplied.\n\nBut I never went in again.\n\nI started hearing things at night. Shuffling. A soft, dragging noise\u2014like something pacing in a circle. One night, I heard humming. A lullaby I couldn\u2019t place.\n\nAnd then, the photos started appearing *outside* the room.\n\nIn my fridge. My coat pocket. My shoe.\n\nOne was pinned to my pillow:  \n**Me. Sleeping.**  \nShot from above.\n\nI called my landlord. I asked about previous tenants. He hesitated before saying:  \n\u201cYou\u2019re in 3B, right?\u201d  \n\u201cYeah.\u201d  \nHe paused again.  \n\u201cThere is no 3B.\u201d\n\nI thought he was messing with me\u2014until I went outside.\n\nThe building has *no third floor.*\n\nI live on the second floor.

Gone.\n\nJust\u2026 the door.\n\nAnd the chair. And the photos.\n\nHundreds now. Thousands maybe. Piled on the floor, pinned to the walls, floating in the air. All of me. Dozens of angles.

Places I knew too well for them to be just dreams, but not from any memory I could name. At first it was harmless. A hallway that shouldn't exist. Familiar voices in a house I\u2019ve never been inside. That sort of thing.\n\nThen came the sushi bar.\n\nIt was clean. Too clean. Empty, except for servers who moved just slightly out of sync with gravity. They didn\u2019t blink. Thick slices of fish of all colors lined the bar. They brought me my favorite roll \u2014 I didn\u2019t order. I hadn\u2019t even spoken. The miso was warm, perfectly made. It should have comforted me.\n\nI did panic, briefly, thinking about how much this was going to cost. While I spiraled in my price anxiety, something struck me as off.\n\nBeneath the table, the floor wasn\u2019t solid. There were vents. And behind those vents... something was breathing.\n\nI know how that sounds. I know. But you might understand what I'm trying to say if you\u2019ve ever had a dream where you can *feel* someone else\u2019s presence \u2014 and that presence isn\u2019t human.\n\nI don\u2019t think it was just a dream. Because something followed me out.\n\nI woke up sweating and twisted in bed. My cat looked up, briefly alarmed, then went back to sleep. I was disturbingly hungry. I have no idea how I slept until 3pm, but I had to get going.\n\nI went to my computer and geared up my workstation. I noticed my keyboard wasn\u2019t lit up like it usually is. Knowing I needed sustenance, I opened up my delivery app and perused the options.\n\n\u201cSushi sounds good,\u201d I said aloud to myself.\n\nI placed an order for several rolls and sashimi, then returned to my weirdly dead keyboard. I pulled on the cord to see if it was unplugged. The connection had been *chewed*. By mice, I assumed \u2014 though I\u2019d never seen a mouse in my apartment.\n\nI dug out my backup wireless keyboard, booted everything up. No tasks appeared on my work queue \u2014 which only happens on Friday afternoons. But it wasn\u2019t Friday. I checked our team chat. One new message, from my boss: a single smiley face. No subject. No context.\n\nWeird.\n\nI figured it was a prank and logged into a game instead. Hours passed. I got hungry again and checked the delivery app. It said the driver was outside.\n\nThree sharp knocks.\n\nI opened the door to find the *strangest* delivery person I\u2019d ever seen.\n\nSky-high green mohawk. Gray trench coat. Leather boots. He looked like one of the kids I went to high school with \u2014 except he wasn\u2019t.\n\nHe said nothing, just held out the food. When I reached for it, he grabbed my wrist.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m here for you.\u201d\n\nI froze.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re outside, but I blocked them for a while. They can\u2019t get in.\u201d\n\nHe let go of my wrist and ducked inside. \u201cHere\u2019s your food.\u201d\n\nI gibbered. I stuttered. Then I half-shouted, \u201cYou need to get out of my house!\u201d\n\nHe peeked through the blinds. \u201cNo worries, mate. I\u2019m not here to hurt you. I\u2019ve been sent to protect you from them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThem?\u201d I asked. \u201cTHEM??\u201d\n\n\u201cCome look,\u201d he said.\n\nI set the food down and, against my better judgment, followed him to the window. Outside looked normal. Cars. Joggers. Dog walkers.\n\n\u201cI said look,\u201d he repeated, \u201cand I meant *look*.\u201d\n\nI stared again \u2014 harder.\n\nThat\u2019s when I saw it. In the bushes next to the trash bins: two long arms with claws. They retracted into the hedge slowly, deliberately.\n\n\u201cYou saw it?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Crater,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019m here to protect you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you\u2019ve said before,\u201d I muttered. \u201cProtect me from *what*?\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t answer. Instead, he ripped open the food bag. \u201cCome. Let\u2019s eat. You\u2019ll need it.\u201d\n\nI stayed wary but sat down. The sushi looked\u2026 perfect. Fat slabs of fish, glossy rice, just enough wasabi. I grabbed a roll.\n\nAnd then came the *rattling* at the door.\n\nSomeone \u2014 something \u2014 was jiggling the doorknob.\n\nI ran over and slammed all the locks shut.\n\nCrater didn\u2019t even look up. \u201cIt\u2019s only delaying the inevitable,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll get in sooner or later.\u201d\n\nMy heart was pounding. \u201cWhat *are* they?\u201d\n\nCrater only shook his head.\n\nSome mix of courage and idiocy took over. I *unlocked* the door.\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d he shouted, but I\u2019d already opened it a crack.\n\nWhat I saw outside wasn\u2019t a person. It wasn\u2019t *right.* Skin like blistered leather. A body shaped like it had been folded wrong.\n\nIt lunged.\n\nI slammed the door and ran to my room, barricading it with furniture. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to work,\u201d Crater\u2019s voice came from behind me.\n\nI spun. \u201cHow did you\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to get through,\u201d he said. \u201cMight as well get it over with.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet WHAT over with?!\u201d\n\nThe door cracked. Furniture buckled. A finger snaked through the splintered wood. Then a hand. Then a face.\n\nMisshapen. Eyes reflective like a cat\u2019s. Stretching the world around it like plastic wrap pulled too tight.\n\nI screamed.\n\nThey got in."},"89":{"title":"My Grandma Said I Couldn\u2019t Open the Front Room\u2014Now the House Is Hissing at Me","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kfhs1q\/my_grandma_said_i_couldnt_open_the_front_roomnow\/","flair":"Series","author":"caliphatchick","selftext":"I knew something was off the moment I got to my grandma\u2019s house and the front porch smelled like old wood, vinegar, and something trying to be lavender.

One room in the whole house with working ghosts-for-vents.\n\nThere\u2019s a painting on the wall of a stern white man in a plantation coat with a Bible in one hand and a cane in the other. Next to him, a little girl. Maybe five. Black. Light-skinned. Eyes like glacier water. Something about her looked familiar.\n\nIt hit me later when I saw the photo on the mantle in the living room. My great-grandmother Ruth.\n\nSame eyes.\n\nThat night, the hissing came back louder. And I swear, I heard chains. Not like dragging-on-the-ground chains. *Shaking*. Like something *angry* and rattling the past.\n\nGrandma came into my room at 3:00 a.m., looking calm as ever, in her satin bonnet and slippers.\n\n\u201cYou let air in. Now it knows you're here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014*what* knows I\u2019m here?\u201d\n\nShe sat on the edge of my bed like this was a casual Tuesday and said, \u201cYour great-grandmother was the daughter of the man who built this house.

A small, humble place that time, with all its wiles and whims, time had mercifully forgotten.\n\nIt was a place where hope was a shared belonging\u2014where children had futures, parents had security, and everyone knew each other\u2019s names.\n\nThe main street ran through the heart of the town like a life\u2014giving river\u2014connecting the antique shops, brick houses, and quiet diners together like tranquil streams. The bells of the church rang with a solemn peace that filled the hearts of those who heard. The bakery opened at 5 a.m. sharp, and the postman waved hello to the shopkeeper at noon every day, like clockwork.\n\nI myself have been happy here in my 32 years of life. I grew up here and was content to die here when my time had come. This place felt like home to me. The very ivy that caressed the red brick walls of the houses in my neighborhood had latched themselves onto my soul and rooted my being here. \n\nMy father, like his father and his before, was the proud owner of the town\u2019s little bookshop\u2014half bookstore, half antique store, smelling of cedar and dust and stories yet unread. It was his pride and joy and, when he passed, it was mine too. \n\nIronic that the place that gave me the most joy\u2014felt the most like home\u2014would be the birthplace of the destruction of all I loved.\n\nI can tell you exactly when it started. \n\nOn a drizzly afternoon, I took my place behind the counter of my beloved shop, like I had so many days before. It stood out to me like a spotlight\u2014obscene in its presence, as if the world itself was forcing my eyes to see it. \n\nThat awful book, bound in the skin of a serpent.\n\nI knew every page of every book in that store\u2014 every crease and every fold. Not one had entered or exited these walls without my knowledge. And yet I didn\u2019t know this one.\n\nIn my curiosity I made my fatal error. And like Adam, my blunder, born from an innocent curiosity, would damn the souls of many.\n\nThe first act was no more than strange. Beautiful, but strange in a way that sickened me to my core\u2014 like watching an explosion. I was seeing something I was never meant to, and I knew it.\n\nYet I yearned to read on. \n\nI flipped the small plastic sign that hung on the door\u2014 \u201cClosed.\u201d I had never done that before, and I didn\u2019t know why I was doing it now, but I needed to.\n\nI spent the rest of that day tearing over the second act. It was unlike the first\u2014 unlike anything I had ever read before. I trembled with fear and the blood left my face. I was cold, feverish. But I didn\u2019t stop until it was done.\n\n When I finished, I returned that beautiful abomination to its place on the shelf and went home, where I fell into a deep sleep. \n\nThat night, under a crescent moon, the wind blew wrong. It carried no scent of pine or chimney smoke. The lively breath of the nature that surrounded the town, tonight, was a sickly gasp. It bestowed its pestilence to us all.\n\nMy dream lasted a mere moment, and an eternity. \n\nI saw the lake of clouds, ever encroaching on the ruins of that great and terrible city, and the sibling suns that it swallowed whole. I witnessed the towers that hid behind the moons, and the black stars that voided out the sky. \n\nWorst\u2014and greatest\u2014of all, I saw his ivory visage.\nAnd in that moment, I knew: one day, I would never leave this place.\n\nBut I never could have imagined how.\n\nI was filled with an awesome dread\u2014 a sick amazement. How could something be so horrible and so wonderful at once?\n\nWhen I woke, the feeling hadn\u2019t left me. It was more than I could bear\u2014 leaving me bedridden for 3 days.\n\nWhen again I could will myself back into life, back into the world outside, it wasn\u2019t the same as I had left it. \n\nI observed the town around me\u2014 the faces I knew were all there. The smiles of my friends and neighbors all exactly as I remembered them. Only, they weren\u2019t. They were pale like porcelain, and gaunt like the grave. \n\nThe books of the children that ran by were stamped with his sallow crest. The necklaces worn by the women bore it on pendants, golden and gleaming. The men muttered to me as I passed\u2014low, reverent words. Awful, beautiful syllables I yet recognized.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for us to be taken. Once his word had spread throughout the town, it was too late. The bearer of that pallid facade owns this place now, and all those in it.\n\nI don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s been\u2014 time has stretched like the shadows of the towers that now shroud us. \n\nThe town I knew is with him now, as are we. \n\nPeople don\u2019t act as they once did\u2014 there are no more friendly greetings or smiling faces. In their place has fallen the same sickness. Lunacy and death have become our life. \n\nHis mad sickness has come over us like a plague\u2014 incurable and all consuming.\n\nThe main street, once the life of our small, quaint town, now points to the spires reverently. Many of the brick walls have taken a new shade of red, repainted by the blood of their residents. The church did not come with us. It\u2019s the last thing that gives me any hope or joy\u2014 the thought that those beautiful bells are still ringing in that place, so far away from here.\n\nIt is a place where madness is a shared belonging. Those left tremble at his presence\u2014 some in fear, others even in joyful obedience. Their faces are an uncanny imitation of his visor, ghostlike in their complexion. \n\nOnce, in the heart of Pennsylvania, there was a town. But that place is gone now. \n\nAs for me, he has a purpose. It\u2019s why you\u2019re reading this now.\n\nHe\u2019s allowed me to send this back\u2014a final message to my home from me, and an invitation from him.\n\nOr perhaps, rather, a warning.\n\nI don\u2019t think he asks.\n\nThe Yellow Sign is a binding seal. If you\u2019ve read this far, I\u2019m sure I will one day meet you. And together, we\u2019ll wander the ruins of the great city for eternity\u2014sprayed by the icy wind of the cloudy lake, beneath the black stars that drink the sky."},"91":{"title":"My mother worshiped ild forgotten gods","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kfdts8\/my_mother_worshiped_ild_forgotten_gods\/","flair":"Series","author":"wenti200","selftext":"Before I begin I need to tell you a little about my mother and the deities she worships\u2014their ancient gods from ages beyond the first dawn when the was nothing but the void.

She tried any means of mystic to shamans but to no effect until she met what then seemed to be my father. He showed her a ritual that could bring life and make anyone fertile but at a cost. You see the cost was a life of tour firstborn and a piece of your soul. Having given up hope my mother didn't hear the words of my soon-to-be father and in the unholy union, they conceived a child a baby girl they called Elspeth\u2026\n\nMy mother tried to raise me as any child. She braided ribbons into my hair and taught me old songs sung in the language of her people\u2014the one she said even the gods forgot. She kept the house warm, the curtains drawn, and salt at every threshold. She laughed with me when she could. But sometimes, when she thought I wasn\u2019t looking, I\u2019d catch her staring at me as though she didn\u2019t recognise the child in front of her.\n\nLike I was something else.\n\nShe kept a journal. I wasn\u2019t supposed to read it, but I did\u2014years later, hidden in the attic, wrapped in red silk. Pages and pages of confessions: how she felt hollow after the ritual. How her dreams bled into waking life. How she thought something followed her home.\n\nShe wrote of waking in the night to find me standing at the foot of her bed, eyes wide open, whispering in a voice that wasn\u2019t mine. She wrote of dead birds found on the windowsill. Of the dog that barked at nothing until its heart gave out.\n\nBut she loved me. I know she did. Even if I was a constant reminder of what she gave up. Of what she bargained away.\n\nI was five when I first heard its voice. Not in dreams. Not in whispers.

I heard her sighing as she closed the door with a quiet click \n\u201cMother, you know I don\u2019t want to,\u201d I huffed, pulling the blanket up and turning away from her, facing the wall. I heard her sigh, long and low, then the soft click of the door closing behind her.\n\nI waited. One minute. Two. The floor creaked faintly beyond the door, then silence.\n\nI sat up.\n\nThe book still lay at the foot of my bed, its crimson cover peeking from beneath the folds of the blanket. I glanced at the door.\n\nShe never let me finish it. Never let me ask questions.\n\nTonight, something was different.\n\nI slipped from the bed, careful to avoid the groaning floorboard near the dresser. My feet were bare. Cold. The candle still burned on the windowsill, the flame wavering as though nervous. I crept to the hallway, holding my breath, and moved toward the end\u2014toward her room.\n\nThe door was ajar.\n\nI paused just outside, heart beating loud in my ears, and leaned in.\n\nShe was kneeling.\n\nAt first, I thought she was praying. Her back was to me, long hair loose down her spine, trembling shoulders lit by the glow of a dozen candles flickering across the room. But then I heard her voice.\n\nNot praying.\n\nChanting.\n\nA language I didn\u2019t recognize\u2014harsh, wet syllables that clung to the walls like cobwebs. The sound of them made my skin crawl. It was like something old and angry had been waiting to be spoken again.\n\nHer hands were raised, fingers twitching in sharp, unnatural gestures. At her feet lay a small bowl, filled with something dark and steaming. Symbols had been scrawled around it in chalk\u2014or something thicker. Something red.\n\n\u201cMama?\u201d I whispered, voice catching in my throat.\n\nShe didn\u2019t stop. She didn\u2019t turn. The chant grew louder. Urgent. The candles flared, their flames stretching tall and thin like they were reaching for something unseen.\n\nSomething was there. I couldn\u2019t see it, not exactly\u2014but I felt it. Heavy and wrong. Like a second presence in the room that hadn\u2019t come through the door.\n\nMy mother gasped, her body jerking forward, hands gripping the edge of the bowl. Her voice faltered.\n\nThen the room went still.\n\nSo still I thought the world had stopped.\n\nAnd then\u2014slowly\u2014she turned her head.\n\nHer eyes were black.\n\nNot dark.\n\nBlack.\n\n\u201cGo back to bed, Mara,\u201d she said, voice calm.

You might think, \u201cIt was always here, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d But you won\u2019t fully grasp it until the right moment.\n\nThat moment is coming.

Just me and my daughter, Ivy. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s ours. Fifth floor, decent view, rent just barely affordable. The building is old, with creaky pipes and paper-thin walls, but it's quiet and no one bothers us.\n\nIvy is four. She\u2019s bright and weird in the best way. Loves bugs, talks to stuffed animals like they\u2019re old friends, invents strange stories on the fly. I\u2019ve always encouraged her imagination. Kids need that. Especially after what we\u2019ve been through.\n\nAt first, it was just normal play. She\u2019d crawl on the floor with her dolls, press her ear to the wood like she was listening for something. I asked her once what she was doing, and she told me, \u201cHe talks funny when he\u2019s sleepy.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t think much of it. Thought she was mimicking a TV character or something.\n\nA few days later, while brushing her teeth, she pointed to the floor and asked if I could \u201ctell the man to stop watching her.\u201d\n\nI froze. Not scared. Just thrown.\n\n\u201cWhat man?\u201d I asked.\n\nShe pointed to the floor again. \u201cThe one who lives under the wood.\u201d\n\nI gave her a confused smile. \u201cHoney, there\u2019s nobody under there. We\u2019re on the fifth floor, remember?\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t respond. Just rinsed and spat like nothing happened.\n\nThat night, I checked the floor while she slept. The boards were dusty but solid. No gaps. No loose panels. Still, I knelt down and tapped a few spots. Hollow, but not unusual. Old floors always sound like that.\n\nOver the next week, Ivy started avoiding the hallway. She would step around specific boards like they were hot. She stopped sleeping in her bed and would sneak into mine without saying a word. When I asked her why, she\u2019d just whisper, \u201cHe gets louder at night.\u201d\n\nI started keeping the TV on while she fell asleep. White noise, comfort. Still, I\u2019d catch her glancing toward the floor in the middle of a show. Like she was waiting for something.\n\nThen, two nights ago, I woke to a loud pop, like a board snapping under weight.\n\nI rushed to her room. She was sitting upright in bed, wide-eyed, staring at the floor. I asked what happened. She pointed to a spot near the corner of the room.\n\nOne of the floorboards was slightly raised. Barely noticeable. But it hadn\u2019t been like that before.\n\nI pressed down on it. It gave a little, like something beneath had pushed upward.\n\n\u201cDid you drop something under there?\u201d I asked.\n\nIvy didn\u2019t answer. She just whispered, \u201cYou touched his door.\u201d\n\nLast night, I barely slept. Every creak of the building made me tense. I turned on every light. Sat in the living room until morning.\n\nThis morning, I went to the kitchen to make coffee and found a piece of paper tucked behind the cereal box. Ivy's drawing. Crayon on lined notebook paper. A stick figure girl stood in a square room. Beneath her feet, a black figure was drawn in a pit of jagged lines, reaching upward with arms too long for its body.\n\nIn the corner of the drawing was a sentence, written in shaky, childish letters:\n\n\u201cHe said you shouldn\u2019t have touched his door.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m more afraid that Ivy drew it.\n\nOr that she didn't."},"94":{"title":"Our first date started in a mall.

We had just finished showering in one of the mall\u2019s many bizarre fountains\u2014this one had a marble statue of the Greek mathematician Euclid. He was holding an abacus which sprayed [water](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1ke1l3i\/our_first_date_started_in_a_mall_we_havent_seen\/).\n\n\u201cLive here? In the **infinite mall**? Are you joking?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know it's not ideal,\u201d Rav dried his beard, he hadn\u2019t shaved since we got stuck. \u201cBut so far it's been able to supply everything we need. Food, clothes, water.\u201d\n\n\u201cRav, no. I can\u2019t even picture it as a joke. Living here would be awful.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a hypothetical question. Would it be so awful?\u201d\n\nI changed into my cargo pants and flannel. We often brought up philosophical debates, it was a nice way to make it feel like we were still in school. But I couldn\u2019t abide by this one.\n\n\u201cEven as a hypothetical, it's a no. I miss living on Earth. I want people to be around me again. Family, friends, anyone. I want normalcy.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor sure, for sure, and I would obviously *rather* have that. But you can at least still have *some* of things via the internet.\u201d He pointed to the iPad on our backpacks.\n\nHe wasn't wrong. Despite being trapped in this bizarre dimension, our cell phones still had service. I could still message my parents and even my friends. I could even technically be taking online courses right now.\n\n\u201cMaybe if we accepted that we\u2019re sort of *castaways* inside this infinite mall\u2014\u201d Rav put on his hiking pants and shirt, \u201c\u2014we could relax our constant need to move. And just focus on\u2026 you know, ourselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cRav.\u201d I grabbed an elastic band and used it as a scrunchie, collecting the hair away from my face. \u201cI\u2019ll focus on myself, once we find a way out of here. I\u2019m not spending the rest of my life trapped in this mall. That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\n\nI pointed at Euclid\u2019s marble, dour-looking face.\n\n\u201cI am *not* getting used to this.\u201d\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nBut that conversation stuck with me.\u00a0\n\nWeeks passed. Rav and I explored the dark hallways of the ever-expanding *City Center Mall* and kept finding more of the usual fare: food courts, clothing stores, nail salons, art shops, toy stores\u2026\n\nSome of the mall plazas were nicer than others. Some had indoor gardens full of flowers. One even featured a small pool across from a martini bar.\n\n*Would it be that bad if we settled down in one of these places? For A week or longer?*\u00a0\n\nEach day, our focus was to explore further, to search for an exit, which I knew was the right approach, but more and more\u2026 I was starting to see Rav\u2019s point.\n\nThe goal had been to reach the part of the mall that was poorly rendered. Everyone in our group chat thought the same thing: \u2018*somewhere on the disintegrating fringes there will be an exit!\u2019*\u00a0\n\nBut we had found those fringes. And there was no exit.\n\nWe came across *Wolmort\u2019s, Brgr Kngs,* and \u2200pple stores full of warped iPhones and chairs fused with ceiling lamps. But there weren't any real exits inside these places.\n\nInstead there were cracks within walls oozing more of that same silver *non-material* that killed Prof Ed. Our brightest minds from Groups B and C would try new approaches to interacting with the silver ooze. And those same minds would attempt to inscribe various math \u2018*exit\u2019* formulas onto the ooze as well.\n\nNothing yielded results.\n\nThe non-matter killed anyone who dared touch it, and the only math equation that actually worked was the one for duplication (which Rav and I had forbidden each other to use).\n\nIt's as if the harder we all tried, the *less* likely we were to find an exit.\n\nThe possibility of escape felt like it was approaching closer and closer to zero.\n\nWe had travelled over 140 miles away from the center, almost three full months of perpetual walking.\n\n\u00a0I was ready for that week off.\n\nI was ready for respite.\n\nAnd then, we found it.\n\n*The library.*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIt was massive.\u00a0\n\nIt took up the entire north wall of the mall plaza Rav and I entered. Instead of several floors of commercial mannequins and furniture staring back at us, we could see window after window full of mahogany bookshelves, shiny wooden globes, and reading desks.\n\nThere were actual *lights inside* too.\u00a0\n\nNot some awful ceiling fluorescents or lamps, but actual *candles.*\n\nWe entered slowly and cautiously, soaking in the architecture that looked elegantly carved from maybe two centuries ago. The word \u201cVictorian\u201d came to mind.\n\nSplinter groups B and C were actually the first to discover the libraries. In fact, it was from their encouragement that we ventured further out and discovered ours.\u00a0\n\nIt appeared that there was perhaps a colossal, continuous **Library Ring** around the mall on all sides (at around the 155 mile radius mark).\n\nOur splinter groups had just reached different sides of it.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nRav and I ate our lunch in a reading area next to the library\u2019s foyer. It felt so nice to be seated in a hand-carved, warmly lit room surrounded by natural wood hues.\u00a0\n\nThere was even a small fireplace at one end, keeping the temperature cozy.\n\nSomehow, all of the flames were perpetual. The candles were everlasting and *brighter* than ordinary candles, illuminating large hand-painted portraits throughout the walls.\u00a0\n\nJust when we thought the mall would go on forever, we encountered this strange, 18th century relic building.\n\n*Was it going to be another 155 miles of library now?*\u00a0\n\n*What did it mean about this dimension\u2019s layout?*\u00a0\n\nRav and I excitedly pointed with our sandwiches, discussing the possibilities. I accidentally sent a large piece of salami flying to the floor\u2014and that\u2019s when I heard someone clear their throat.\n\n\"Und wer sind Sie?\u201c\n\nOur conversation froze. Rav and I turned to see a tiny pair of tiny spectacles staring at us. Tiny spectacles sitting on the nose of a slightly greying, mustachioed man with a pipe clenched in his mouth. He leaned against the doorframe, eying us suspiciously.\n\nRav spoke first. \u201cUhh\u2026 excuse me?\u201d\n\nThe man blew a small puff of coal-black smoke \u201cAh. English. I see.\u201d\u00a0\n\nHis tiny, perfectly circular glasses made the rest of his head look overly large. His dark, stygian suit matched the black leather shoes which strode towards us calmly.\n\n\u201cWillkommen. I am Schr\u00f6dinger. And you are?\u201d\n\nWe both put down our sandwiches.\n\n\u201cErmm\u2026 I\u2019m Claudia.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Rav...\u201d\n\nHe stared at our massive camping backpacks that lay haphazardly on the floor. Then he inspected our 7-Eleven sandwiches as if they were alien creatures.\n\n\u201cYou wear strange uniforms.\u201d He gestured to our hiking clothes. \u201cNot academics, surely?\u201d\n\nNeither Rav nor I knew where to start.\n\n\u201cUh.. well technically, we both are students, yes.\u201d\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger looked directly at my face and puffed from his pipe. \u201cForgive me, Fr\u00e4ulein but intellectual pursuits are a little ill-suited to feminine temperaments. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cI... \u201d words tripped on themselves in my throat. \u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d\n\nThen the man pointed his pipe at Rav. \u201cAnd you, a Hindu. I\u2019ve studied some Oriental metaphysics too. Is that what you used to arrive here?\u201d\n\nNeither of us knew how to react. Eventually, Rav gave his head a shake. \u201cWait a minute. \u2026 Are you *the* Schr\u00f6dinger? Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger?\u201d\n\nThe man took a step back and exhaled a large puff of black.\u00a0 \u201cI am the one asking questions. How did you arrive?\u201d\n\nRav and I stood up from the table. The vibe felt pretty threatening.\n\n\u201cWe got here some three months ago.\u201d I pointed outside the window beside us, out towards the darkness. \u201cWe walked in. From the mall.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u201c*Mall*?\u201d It was like he had never heard the word before. He gestured to the front entrance nearby. \u201cYou came from *there*?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Uh. From the steps outside?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me\u2026\u201d\u00a0 Schr\u00f6dinger held his pipe above his head, as if nursing a headache\u201c...You *strolled up* the steps and entered *Der Mathemandelsring* without an invitation?\u201d\u00a0\n\nRav scratched his neck. \u201cI mean\u2026 we were forced into here. It was kind of against our will, we don\u2019t mean any\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014Only inducted theoreticians may grace these halls!\u201d Schr\u00f6dinger pointed with his pipe accusingly. \u201cThis is not some luncheon hall.\u201d\n\nRav shot me a worried look.\u00a0\n\n\u201cSorry, sorry. We are both students.\u201d He quickly grabbed one of our napkins and wiped our crumbs off the parlor table. \u201cWe were just looking for a dining area. I\u2019m a theoretician too though. I study Applied Math.\u201d\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger adjusted his glasses\u2014they now reflected the fireplace\u2019s flames.\n\n\u201cYou? A theoretician?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cWho brought you? Von Neumann?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. I\u2026 We brought ourselves?\u201d\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger shook his head. I could see his face was getting flush. \u201cWe do not allow for loitering drifters here.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut hold on\u2026\u201d Rav unfolded a piece of paper from his pants. It was our own duplication formula (to be used in emergencies only). He held out the complex equation as evidence.\n\n\u201cI can read all of this. In fact, I wrote all of this. I\u2019m a mathematician too.\u201d\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger took a step towards us, and\u00a0 examined the creased paper.\n\n*\u201cWe could also just leave,\u201d* I whispered to Rav.\n\nRav squeezed my hand back.\n\n\u201cAn interesting solution to *Banach-Tarski,\u201d* Schr\u00f6dinger tapped at the page. \u201cSo you know a bit of math.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do.\u201d Rav smiled, trying to appear cooperative. \u201cIn fact, I would love to learn more. We\u2019ve been trying to find a particular formula on our journey. An escape solution. Maybe this library could be of some use to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014And since you have not been properly inducted upon your arrival here\u2014then *I* shall be your officiant.\u201d Schr\u00f6dinger exhaled a large dark puff at our faces.\n\nHe went to unfurl an enormous scroll from the ceiling, which was covered in dense math.\n\n\u201c*Der Mathemandelsring* is a sacred place. You are familiar with the entrance exam, no doubt.\u201d\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger produced a fountain pen and began to add Greek letters on the giant paper. His wrist whipped back and forth, ending with a flourish for the final stroke.\n\nThe air stirred with reverberation.\u00a0\n\nA gigantic wooden crate appeared beside Schr\u00f6dinger. A large brown box.\n\n\u201cUsing all of the Arithmancy at your disposal, you must *overcome my equation,* young applicant.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure\u2026\u201d Rav looked at me, holding his paper out and grabbed a marker from his pocket. \u201cSo this is like a math test?\u201d\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger used his pipe to tap the side of the large box.\n\n\u201cSurely you\u2019ve heard of my *cat.\u201d*\n\nThe front wall of the box fell forward, revealing a massive black *jaguar.* It awoke from a long-coiled slumber.\n\nAdrenaline hit me from the mere sight of the animal. It was enormous.\u00a0\n\nThe cat yawned and stepped out of the box, exposing large, shining fangs. Its yellow eyes darted between Rav and myself. A low rumble came from its throat.\n\n\u201cWoah. What? This *cat* is your test?\u201d Rav backed away,\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d Schr\u00f6dinger resumed smoking his pipe. His puffs stretched into long black whisps which appeared to flow *into* the cat.\n\n\u201cYour exam begins now.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe cat hissed, and pounced toward us.\n\nWe scurried behind a reading desk.\u00a0\n\nThe whole place had rows of reading desks like a classroom, but they weren't very tall, or obstructive.\u00a0\n\nWe watched rather helplessly, as the jaguar leapt from desk to desk and flanked us.\n\n\u201cHer name is Vanta.\u201d Schr\u00f6dinger followed.\n\nThe car leapt onto a desk closer to us. For a split second, I saw the cat fall onto its neck in a brutal misstep. But then that reality flickered away. The cat instead glared ferociously atop the nearby desk.\u00a0\n\nRav reached into his breast pocket and pulled out the revolver. \u201cBack away! Back!\u201d\n\nAs soon as gun\u2019s barrel aimed at the cat, she hopped away and slinked behind a desk.\n\n*She\u2019s seen guns before.*\u00a0\n\n\u201cQuick! Now\u2019s our chance!\u201d I pulled Rav. We scrambled out a side exit.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWith the door slammed shut, we found ourselves inside a massive library hall. Bookshelves reached almost two stories high. Tall rolling ladders installed everywhere. We ran down the closest aisle, carefully looking over our shoulders\n\n\u201cYour Glock handy?\u201d Rav asked.\n\nI could feel the small pistol\u2019s weight shuffle under my flannel. I had really hoped I wasn't going to have to use it \u2026 but this was life or death.\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\nWhen we reached the far end of the aisle, I pulled out the handgun, and undid the safety.\n\nNothing had followed behind us. But that didn\u2019t mean shit. I remembered learning about cougars from camp once. Their paws were cushioned so you couldn\u2019t hear them sneaking, and they'd stay low to the ground so you couldn\u2019t see their shadow\u2026\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Rav said, swallowing lumps. \u201cIf it's just the panther. I think we can take her. Don\u2019t aim for the head, just the center mass. Body shots.\u201d\n\nI nodded and watched the ceiling candelabras swing as something jumped from one to the other.\n\nThe cat was prowling atop the bookshelves.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t rush.\u201d Rav whispered. \u201cWait til she gets closer\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe yellow eyes glinted, I could feel Vanta singling me out. She wanted to pounce down on the smaller, more vulnerable human. I lined up my iron sights, and tested holding the trigger\u2026\n\n*BLAM!*\n\nThe top bookshelf exploded into splinters.\u00a0\n\nThe cat slipped off and landed back-first onto the ground with a *CRACK!*\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThen Vanta *flickered.* Suddenly she was standing upright, as if landing perfectly.\n\n\u201cGet back!\u201d Rav fired two rounds. The cat flickered out of existence again.\n\n\u00a0The marble ground sparked from the bullets.\u00a0\n\nThe cat reappeared, totally unharmed.\n\n\u201cOh good.\u201d Rav said.\n\nVanta took a leap towards us. I closed my eyes and fired.\u00a0\n\n*Rrreeeeooow!!\u201d*\n\n*THUD!* The cat fell right before me, I could see her wince from a fresh bullet wound on her shoulder. She hissed and began to flicker in and out of existence like an old projector.\n\nMy gun followed her tail until she scampered behind another aisle.\n\n\u201cHow did you hit it?\u201d Rav grabbed my hand. He dragged us back.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know! I just shut my eyes and\u2026 I don\u2019t know!\u201d\n\nWe backed up a small set of steps.\n\n\u201cShut your eyes?... \u201c Rav squinted, digging around his memory. \u201cOf course!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cObserver effect!\u201d\n\nWe ran into the open center of the library where we could see all the bookshelf aisles behind us. We both scanned for any signs of the predator.\n\n\u201cSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cat is both alive and dead,\" Rav said. \"She won\u2019t be just one or the other until someone observes her \u2014 until we collapse her quantum state.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we *have* been observing her. In fact, there she is.\u201d\u00a0\n\nI pointed to a distant bookshelf labelled *Geographia,* where black shadow was prowling behind book spines.\n\n\u201cYes, and because we keep watching her, I think her \u201calive\u201d state is able to recrystallize over and over\u2026\n\n\u201cSo she's \u2026\u00a0 permanently alive?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs long as we keep looking at her.\u201d\n\nHer head poked out one of the aisles. Her whiskers rose up as she *snarled.*\u00a0 Then she pulled back into the shadows and crawled away.\n\n\u201cI think if we close our eyes while delivering the killing blow \u2026 then she might actually stay dead.\u201d\n\nI had trouble keeping a straight face.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to kill this cat \u2026 without looking at it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. And we can\u2019t look at the remains either.\u201d\n\nWe heard the scrape of her feet around the edges of the library. She was running outside of visibility, circling around the bookshelves behind us.\n\n\u201cWell we sure can\u2019t see her now!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. But because she was last seen alive, she will stay alive.\u201d\n\nHer running quickened, I saw her tail whip behind a series of antique earth globes. Each one spun as she bolted past them.\n\n\u201cRav. This is fucked!\u201d\n\n\u201cHere, grab.\u201d\u00a0\n\nHe ripped out a page from a book on a shelf.\n\nStill aiming my gun, I grabbed the page he gave me. It was a map of some lake.\n\n\u201cOnce the cat comes close. Hold the page out in front of you.\u201d He demonstrated, holding another page against his eyes.\n\nI briefly did the same. The parchment was thin enough for me to barely see the outline of objects ahead of me. \u201cIf you can\u2019t see her when you shoot her, she\u2019ll stay dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see.\u201d I said. And then thought: *this if fucked.*\n\nWe both followed the creaks of the cat as she slithered between bookshelves. She would growl, throwing her voice and bouncing it off the walls behind us. She knew what she was doing.\n\nWe backed up to a large reception-looking desk which Rav helped me stand on top of. I would cover us from higher ground. Rav stuck to the floor.\n\n\u201cPsst!\u201d Rav pointed at an antique book cart, loaded with books. I saw it jostle for a second.\u00a0\n\nThen it startled to travel in our direction\n\n\u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d\n\nBehind the rolling iron wheels, I saw a pair of paws. *This cat was smarter than I thought.* Vanta pushed the cart in our direction and came prowling behind it for cover.\n\n\u201cHere we go.\u201d Rav ran to one side of the wheels. \u201cCover me!\u201d\n\nI held my gun steady.\n\nBriefly, I tried lifting Rav\u2019s paper over my eyes. But it was too opaque at this distance. I threw it away.\u00a0\n\nThen the cat leaped out.\u00a0\n\nRav squeezed his eyes and fired.\u00a0\n\nThe cat howled with injury. She began to flicker.\u00a0\n\nThen the cat flickered her wounds away, and stared at me, *the last observer.*\n\n\u201cFuck!\u201d I lined up my shot and fired.\n\nI shut my eyes and fired twice more.\n\n\u201cShit!\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I got it!\u201d\n\n\u201cComing back!\u201d\n\n\u201cComing back?\u201d\n\n\u201cRunning towards you!\u201d\n\n\u201cWho? The cat?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, me!\n\n\u201cCan I open my eyes?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d\n\nIn what might have been the longest moment of my life, I kept my eyes closed and his behind the\u00a0 desk.\n\nI heard Rav\u2019s footsteps clomp towards me, and I *thought* I heard the scampering of paws.\n\n\u201cIs it behind you!?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hear its paws!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! Claudia, *do not* look this way!\u201d\n\nI covered my face, and cradled myself, holding my breath. Rav\u2019s arms found me and spun me to face the wall.\n\n\u201cYou can open your eyes now, just don\u2019t look behind us.\u201d\n\nRav and I were both behind the wooden desk and staring at a shelf of books.\n\n\u201cDid you see it die?\u201d I asked him.\n\n\"I did. But then you shot it?\u201d\n\nI swallowed a guilty rock. \u201cI think I was still \u2018observing\u2019 it. So I fired again.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo did *you* kill it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Did it follow you?\u201d\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t sense anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I heard some scampering.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure it wasn\u2019t me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Let\u2019s just\u2026 wait.\u201d\n\nAnd wait we did, for what felt like an eternity. We held each other, facing the wall, not looking back, as if we were Orpheus and Eurydice. I kept imagining the stealthy Jaguar creeping up behind us, waiting for the perfect moment to leap onto our heads.\n\nBut it never came.\n\nAfter we counted two hundred Mississippi's, Rav stood up and carefully left our hiding spot.\n\nHe lifted his arms and walked out backwards towards the center. Nothing attacked him.\n\nI sensed a powerfully strong tobacco-smell mixed with burning tar.\u00a0\n\nThen came a scoff.\n\n\u201cWell I guess that's one way to do it. You\u2019ve vanquished Vanta.\u201d\n\nRav froze in his steps. I saw him tentatively turn his head.\n\n\u201cYes. You may both look this way. I've boxed her up.\n\nWith the utmost hesitancy I turned around to see Schr\u00f6dinger standing between the book cart and a wooden box that appeared on his left.\n\nHis pipe was clenched in his teeth. His arms were crossed brusquely against his charcoal three piece suit.\n\n\u201cYou were supposed to use *Arithmancy*. And yet you did not use a single formula. What a shame.\u201d\n\nRav wiped a pool of accrued sweat from his forehead. \u201cWhat? I thought we just had to overcome your\u2026 cat.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyone can shoot an animal with a boorish revolver. What a pathetic aptitude you\u2019ve shown.\u201d\n\nRav scratched his beard. He unfolded our copy equation from his pocket once more. \u201cI can still duplicate myself if you want. We understand how math works in this worl\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014No, it's too late now.\u201d Schr\u00f6dinger waved his hand. \u201cThe test is over. You have failed to demonstrate any mathematical ability.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. Please.\u201d Rav waved his hands until they came together in a small prayer. \u201cThere's got to be another way. Another chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo second chances. Your exam is a failure. You must leave.\u201d\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nBecause of his ability to summon *boxes of jaguars*, we didn't push our luck with Schr\u00f6dinger.\n\nHe very cordially guided us towards the entrance we came through.\n\nAlthough definitely a little saddened that we couldn't see more of the **Library Ring,** I was just happy to leave with our lives.\n\n\u201cThis door will soon become locked for you, and you may never enter again.\u201d Schr\u00f6dinger pointed at the exit foyer. \u201cRespect the rules of *Der Mathemandelsring*\u201d\n\nRav seemed to acquiesce with a glum nod.\n\nWhen we opened the door and looked outside, I could see that the oblique darkness of the mall was gone. Instead, we saw overcast clouds over a *well-manicured lawn?*\n\n\u201cWait what\u2026\u201d I said, astounded. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger furrowed his brow. \u201c Fraulein, that is outside. And that is where you will go.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this isn't where we were before.\u201d Rav stared with wide eyes. \u201cIs this\u2026 are we in America?\u201d\n\nFor some reason this really made Schr\u00f6dinger laugh. His mustache danced a little on his face.\u00a0 His yellow teeth shone. \u201dNo, you are not in *America.* And you are not allowed back inside. Auf Vederzen.\u201d\n\nHe waved at us until we left. The door was shut tight, I could hear locks being put in place.\u00a0\n\nThere was a cobblestone road up to this library, and I could see two old horse-drawn carriages parked around a sort of thoroughfare. Birds flew above us, cawing and landing on distant trees.\u00a0\n\nIt was the widest open space we had seen in months.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d\n\nI checked my phone.\u00a0\n\nI still had reception.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nEveryone was dressed in breeches and dresses, all woven from wool and linen.\u00a0\n\nThey must have been groundskeepers or landscapers part of the estate, they all eyed us with open curiosity, but kept their distance.\n\nWe were too afraid to talk to anyone at first, so we walked out a bit further and watched the **Library Ring** shrink behind us. Though out here, it was no longer a ring at all. Just a large building, made of stone and glass windows. You could mistake it for an old church.\n\nWalking out further, we came across something hard to grasp at first. It honestly felt like I was looking at a picture from a history book.\u00a0\n\nIt was an old European village.\n\nI saw an assembly of cottages, cobble roads, dogs and children running about, hooting and hollering as if they were re-enacting a Charles Dickens novel. There was even a bell-tower in the distance.\n\n*\u201cAnd whose might you be?\u201d*\n\nIt was a boy. He came to us running, rolling a metal wheel with a stick like it was the best thing in the world. *\u201cYouse just came from the library, eh?\u201d*\n\nRav and I both turned to each other and took a deep breath.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe village was called **Yore.**\u00a0\n\nAt first, everyone stayed away from us, which made it awkward. They would gawk at our clothes, whisper to each other, and never return our waves of hello. It\u2019s like they thought we were ghosts or something.\n\nBut in a few short hours, the village children kept visiting us, and when the fact spread that *we came from the library,* everyone's opinion quickly changed.\n\nWe were given proper handshakes, and treated as \u2018educated aristocrats\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe library always brings prosperity.\u201d A man pulling a cow said.\n\nThey gave us a warm meal at the town tavern, and allowed us to stay at the local inn, where we got our own dedicated room. I offered them a Bulgari necklace as payment which they happily accepted.\u00a0\n\n\u201cPlease, stay as long as you need, honorable librarians.\u201d\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nBy day two, we had gotten to know the barkeeper downstairs, who introduced us to the sheriff across the street, who took us to visit several farmers down the road, who showed us where we could harvest fresh vegetables for ourselves.\u00a0\n\nThere was an abundance of crops this year.\n\nEveryone was astonishingly nice, no one seemed all that bothered by the mud caked on their roads, or the pallid greyness of the sky \u2026 things just were as they were.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nOur days in town move by fast, and I had to be selective with how often I turned on my phone to record these entries.\n\nOn our third day, Rav and I went for a trek outside the town, just to get a sense of the landscape. We had planned to finish some of the last of our snacks from the mall on a long hike.\n\nWe had barely walked a mile out, when we came across the same old library we left the previous day. And then past the library, we *looped* back into the town.\n\nNo matter what direction we went into, the fields full of ankle-high grass would always send us back to **Yore**.\n\nIt\u2019s like we were inside some kind of enclosed universe.\n\nWhen Rav and I made this discovery, we both sat down in the grass field.\n\nWe held each other. And teared up.\u00a0\n\nThere were no words. But we both felt the same kind of sadness.\n\nWe still were not free.\n\nWe were inside something even more miniature than the mall.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nOur batteries were running low, and we knew we couldn\u2019t recharge them anywhere here.\u00a0\n\nWe sent abrupt farewells to any of our friends and family still communicating via our phones. And we sent farewells to our group chat with splinter Groups B and C (though they both had both gone unresponsive after entering the Library Ring).\n\nMaybe there was still some specific equation that could still get us out.\u00a0\n\nMaybe there was a math test we could take to try and get back in the Library\u2026\n\nBut somehow both Rav and I could sense we were officially *very* far from home.\u00a0\n\nWherever we were. We were going to be here for a while.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThat night, we camped out in the field.\n\nThere weren\u2019t any stars that came out at night, the low-hanging grey cloud appeared to be a perpetual feature, but nonetheless, we laid in the grass and said goodbye to our old lives.\n\nThe all-dark sky slowly swallowed away our past.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nBut, just like with everything, time passes. Emotions wane. After a week, we learned that **Yore** was *not* like the mall.\u00a0\n\nWe found ourselves sitting in at the town chapel each morning, just like everyone else, taking comfort in the feeling of being around living people.\n\nWhereas the **infinite mall** had been dead, and soul-sucking, **Yore** was at least alive, moving, and breathing.\n\nRav and I joined the group of farmers and helped with the crops.\u00a0\n\nWe were given proper, rancher clothes, and got down on our knees and palms, digging up the potatoes by hand.\u00a0\n\nWe even helped peel and cook them at the town hall kitchen. There was a communal dinner every night.\n\nIt felt a little disingenuous to be trying to distract ourselves like this. Rav and I both knew the lives we had before. Our former dream of escape\u2026\n\nBut the more we accepted that this could just be a prolonged break\u2014A prolonged \u2018vacation\u2019 for ourselves\u2014the easier it was to embrace life as it was now.\n\nWe both longed for some inner peace.\n\n\\*\\*\\*  \n\\*\\*\\*  \n\\*\\*\\*\n\nMany months have passed since settling in **Yore.**\n\nThis digital version of my journal will have to be laid to rest.\n\nI\u2019ve used this as a historical record for our time in the mall, but it's since evolved into my own diary of events which I\u2019m writing on paper now.\n\nI\u2019m sending these words while I still have bars on my phone, while using up the final juice of my last spare battery.\n\nTo whomever finds this story, you should know that Rav and I are perfectly content here.\u00a0\n\nJust yesterday we had joined a crew of landscapers tidying up the grass around the sacred library. We were pulling weeds outside the thoroughfare when a boy beside us pointed at the library\u2019s front door.\n\nIt had opened briefly to let out some black smoke, then closed again within a moment.\n\nRav and I watched the door. For a moment we even contemplated rushing at the latch with our spades and rake in an effort to try and pry it open.\n\nBut then the urge passed.\n\nRav offered me some berries he\u2019d collected from a copse nearby. They were juice and sweet. \u201cForget the Library, forget the mathematicians. Our lives are our own now.\u201d\n\nA warm breeze filtered through my hair\n\nI held his hand and gave it a squeeze. *\u201cDo not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not.\u201d*\n\n\u201cAnd what philosopher is that? \u201c\n\n\u201cEpicurus\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cIs he the one who loved food?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, that is actually a misattribution. He liked food but only as a simple pleasure, not as an indulgent luxury.\u201d\n\nRav ate a berry. \u201cRight. So it sounds like he would definitely be approving of our situation right now.\u201d\n\nI thought about what other Greek philosophers might say about our current circumstances. *Were we inside some kind of Plato's cave? Were we just deluding ourselves to stay sane?...*\n\nI brushed some dirt off my pants and gave a long exhale.\n\n\u201cI don't care what the philosophers think. I have you. I'm happy with you.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me carefully, as if to check if I was joking.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou mean you're still not sick of our very long first date?\u201d\n\nI shook my head.\n\nWe both kissed.\n\nAt some point later we\u2019d find a way back into the library. But not for now. Not anytime soon.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAfter calling it a day, we went back to the village.\n\nThey were putting on a play in the town square that afternoon. A community theater rendition of *Hamlet*. We were both excited to see how they would pull off the *\u201cto be or not to be\u2019*\u2019 scene.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou think they'll use an actual skull?\u201d Rav asked.\n\n\u201cEven if they do\u2026\u201d I squeezed his hand. \u201c...

Head-on collision. Drunk driver. Declared dead at the scene.\n\nThat was back in 2020. Grieving him through the pandemic, completely isolated, was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do. But I worked through it with my parents, with his mom. I\u2019ve even started dating again.\n\nBut then the texts started.\n\nI got the first one while I was on a date at some overfancy Italian place. A text, from Drew\u2019s number. It was blank. Like someone had just hit the space bar and hit \u201csend.\u201d\n\nI got the next one a few days later, in the evening, while I was curled up with a book. It just had a period. \u201c.\u201d\n\nAt first, I thought it was a prank, as cruel as that would be. Or maybe it was well-intentioned, by an older person or someone on the spectrum. Maybe they thought the texts would make me happy. I asked around, but no one knew. I thought about going to the police\u2014but there was nothing threatening in them. Just strings of weird punctuation.\n\n*Maybe it\u2019s a glitch,*\u00a0I thought. Maybe the system had reactivated his number by accident and was sending bits of code to me.\n\nBut the texts seemed to have a pattern. They were often sent when I was on a date, or getting ready for one. It seemed\u00a0*just*\u00a0enough to be more than coincidental. I tried telling myself I was being paranoid, that it was all just chance.\n\nAs the anniversary of his death approached, though, the texts increased in frequency. They went from one or two a week to one a day. \u201c\u2026\u201d \u201c.,.\u201d \u201c,,:\u201d \u201c,\u2026\u2026.\u201d. Just nonsensical punctuation, every time.\n\nI was starting to get desensitized to them. The first one had made me cry. Now, they just annoyed me.\n\nOn the anniversary of Drew\u2019s death, though, the texts increased tenfold.\n\nI got five of them before noon.\n\nOver fifteen in the afternoon. And as the time of his death approached\u20149:11 PM\u2014they came in faster and faster.\n\n*This is way more than coincidence.*\n\n*Someone is fucking with me.*\n\nI went to the police. They said they\u2019d be able to trace where the texts were coming from, but they\u2019d need some time to get in touch with the cell company.\u00a0*\u201cProbably just a scammer,\u201d*\u00a0the officer had said, even though I told him everything.\u00a0*\u201cThere are tons of scams now, with how bad the economy is...\u201d*\n\n*\u201cBut they\u2019re not trying to get anything out of me,\u201d*\u00a0I\u2019d told them.\u00a0*\u201cAnd they\u2019re texting me way more today than any other day. On the day my husband died.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss,\u201d*\u00a0the officer had said, in a detached tone.\u00a0*\u201cWe\u2019ll get in touch with you when we know more. Okay?\u201d*\n\nSo what else could I do?\n\nI went back home to start the tradition I did every year. At 7 o\u2019clock I put on his favorite movie,\u00a0*Stranger Than Fiction,*\u00a0and opened a bottle of wine. I patted the seat next to me, as if gesturing an invisible him to sit down.\n\nI liked to talk to him. Pretend he was actually sitting there with me.\n\n\u201cMaggie Gyllenhaal is so cute,\u201d I told the empty spot. \u201cI\u2019d totally date her if I wasn\u2019t married to you. And if, you know, she wasn\u2019t a movie star.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill Ferrell is\u00a0*so*\u00a0young in this. He looks like a\u00a0*baby.\u201d*\n\n\u201cHaha, he\u2019s so awkward. She totally hates him.\u201d\n\nMy phone pinged.\n\n**\u201c\u2026;**\u201d\n\nI frowned at it.\n\nI decided to call the police station again. They told me they didn\u2019t have any news.\n\nI looked at the empty spot.\n\n\u201cI miss you,\u201d I said, sucking in a deep breath. \u201cI miss you so much.\u201d\n\nI looked at the phone, waiting for it to ping. A small part of me wishing it would, like he\u2019d heard me.\n\n*What if the texts really are Drew?*\n\n*Somehow?*\n\nI thought of that Twilight Zone episode. Where the old woman keeps getting phone calls, and then they find a downed telephone pole, the wires dangling over her husband\u2019s grave. Was this sort of the 2000s equivalent of that? Had some spooky ghost EMF jammed the wireless cell communications?\n\nBut the phone didn\u2019t ping. Of course it didn\u2019t. This wasn\u2019t his ghost trying to contact me. This was someone\u00a0*fucking*\u00a0with me, someone playing a sick game.\n\nThe only answer I\u2019d get was from the police.\n\nI got up and refilled my wine glass. But my hands were shaking as I poured. As I tried to set it back on the counter, I dropped it\u2014\n\n*Crash.*\n\nThe glass bottle shattered into a thousand jagged pieces. Merlot wine like blood pooled on the floor.\u00a0*\u201cFuck,\u201d*\u00a0I whispered. Fighting tears, I got a garbage bag and bent down to pick up the pieces\u2014\n\n*\u201cOw!\u201d*\n\nThe piece I\u2019d picked up had sliced right into my thumb. Never clean shattered glass while you\u2019re tipsy and crying, I guess. Cursing, I stood up and ran my thumb under the faucet, staining the water red\u2014\n\n*Ping.*\n\nI glanced over at my phone, sitting on the couch armrest.\n\nI turned off the faucet.\n\nMade my way over to it.\n\nMy heart plummeted as I saw the text.\n\n**\u201c: )\u201d**\n\nNot a blank text.\n\nNot a string of nonsense.\n\nA fucking\u00a0*smiley face.*\n\nAfter I\u2019d just cut myself.\n\nAnd not any smiley face. A colon, then a space, then a parenthesis\u2014*exactly*\u00a0how Drew made his smiley faces. He never wanted autocorrect or Gchat or whatever program to turn it into an emoji or actual smiley face.\n\n*Someone is watching me.*\n\n*And they really,*\u00a0really\u00a0*want to fuck with me.*\n\nI ran over to the kitchen window, tiptoeing around the glass. I pulled the curtains shut over the sink. Then I ran around the house, checking every lock.\n\nI called the police. \u201cI think they\u2019re watching me,\u201d I whispered.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey sent me a smiley face.\u00a0*Right after*\u00a0I cut myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay\u2026 that\u2019s probably just a coincidence\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve never sent a smiley face before! Or\u00a0*anything*\u00a0other than nonsense!\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, calm down. You know what? I\u2019m going to get in touch with the cell company right away. I\u2019ll call you back in about\u2026 twenty minutes. Okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nI glanced at the clock.\n\n8:59 PM.\n\n12 minutes before Drew died.\n\nI walked back to the couch, blood blooming on the paper towel wrapped around my finger. The phone was going off like crazy now.\u00a0*Ping.*\u00a0**\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d**\u00a0*Ping.*\u00a0**\u201c..:;..:::\u201d**\u00a0*Ping.*\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d I hissed.\n\nI looked at the empty spot.\n\nThe paused frame of Maggie Gyllenhaal and Will Ferrell looking at each other.\n\n*Ping.

Finally. \u201cHello?\u201d I asked, my voice wavering.\n\n*\u201cGet out of the house.\u201d*\n\nHis voice was low, coming through the speaker.\n\n*\u201cThe texts are coming from inside your house.\u201d*\n\nAll the blood drained out of my face. I leapt up and scrambled towards the front door\u2014\n\nHands pulled me back roughly from behind. I fell flat on my face. Pain shot up my back. I looked up, blinking\u2026 and found myself looking up at Drew\u2019s mother.\n\n*\u201cWhore,\u201d*\u00a0she snarled, spit spraying on my face. Her foot collided with my side as she kicked me. \u201cYou think you can just pretend like he didn\u2019t exist, don\u2019t you? As soon as he\u2019s dead, you just go off and start dating again.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 been\u2026 five\u2026 years,\u201d I gasped.\n\n\u201cYou never really loved him, did you?!\u201d she shrieked.\n\nI tried to scramble up. She kicked me again. I coughed blood onto the carpet. \u201cStop,\u201d I whimpered.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re nothing but a\u2014\u201d\n\nThe door slammed open.\n\nA police officer was standing in the doorway.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe police had enough evidence to arrest Drew\u2019s mother.

No one would believe me anyway\u2014not without seeing what I saw, hearing what I heard. But lately, something\u2019s been humming in the back of my skull, like a signal waiting to be answered. I need to get this out before it gets worse.\n\nIt started with a hum.\n\nI live alone on the outskirts of a dying town in northern Arizona. Closest neighbor is five miles off. That\u2019s how I like it\u2014quiet, undisturbed. I\u2019m a night owl by habit, always fiddling with old ham radios in my shed, scanning through static like I might tune into God.\n\nThat night, it wasn\u2019t God.\n\nAround 2:13 AM, the static on my receiver snapped into something rhythmic. A pulse. Soft at first. Then louder. Then words. Not English. Not anything I knew. Just this garbled voice repeating something, glitching like a scratched CD: \u201cEk-sha\u2026 tik-ra\u2026 ek-sha\u2026 tik-ra\u2026\u201d\n\nI froze. The signal wasn\u2019t bouncing off anything local. I had the gear to tell\u2014it was straight down from the sky. Direct.\n\nMy shed lights flickered. My radio shorted out. And then\u2026 silence. No crickets. No wind. Not even the buzz of the power lines out by the road. It was like the world had inhaled and forgotten how to exhale.\n\nThen the sky cracked.\n\nNot thunder. Not lightning. The damn sky cracked. Split in a jagged line of light\u2014like a broken mirror bleeding white. And from that fissure, something slid out.\n\nI couldn\u2019t see it clearly at first\u2014just movement. A shimmer, like oil on water, warping the air around it. Then it solidified. Tall. Lanky. Limbs too long, like someone stretched a human until it nearly broke.\n\nIt didn\u2019t walk. It unfolded.\n\nI didn\u2019t move. I couldn\u2019t. Every instinct told me not to blink, not to breathe. I was prey, and that thing\u2026 it was the trap.\n\nIt looked at me. No eyes, but I knew it looked. I felt it inside my head, like a cold needle threading through memories. Childhood. My father\u2019s funeral. The first time I kissed a girl. All of it, sifted through in seconds. It tasted me.\n\nThen it spoke\u2014no mouth, no sound. Just a thought, loud as thunder and slick as oil.\n\n\u201cNot ready.\u201d\n\nI collapsed. I don\u2019t remember falling, but I woke up in the dirt hours later, blood crusted around my nose and ears. My watch was frozen at 2:13 AM. The sky above was calm again. But there were footprints. Long, deep impressions\u2014three-toed, like talons\u2014leading away from the shed into the woods.\n\nI should\u2019ve run. Should\u2019ve called someone. But curiosity\u2019s a disease.\n\nSo I followed.\n\nThe woods were wrong. Trees leaning the wrong way, shadows twitching when nothing moved. The deeper I went, the quieter it got, until even my own footsteps stopped making sound.\n\nI found the circle in a clearing. Burned into the earth. Charred, blackened, but pulsing faintly beneath the ash. In the center: a small, metallic cube. Smooth. No seams. No reflections. Just cold.\n\nI picked it up. That was my second mistake.\n\nThe moment my fingers touched the metal, something clicked in my brain. Like a door opening. Images flooded my mind\u2014flashes of cities melting, people levitating into beams of light, time collapsing into itself. A countdown started behind my eyes.\n\n\u201cNot ready,\u201d the voice echoed again, fainter this time, as if buried behind glass.\n\nWhen I woke up again, the cube was gone. But something else stayed.\n\nNow I hear it every night\u2014the hum. It\u2019s louder now. Constant. There\u2019s something beneath it, too. A whisper. Words I shouldn\u2019t understand, but I do.\n\nThey\u2019re coming back.\n\nNot just for me. For everyone.\n\nI think I was scanned. Tagged. Like some specimen in a petri dish. And that cube? It wasn\u2019t a gift. It was a key.\n\nI\u2019ve seen the sky crack twice more since then\u2014quick slits, gone in seconds. Always followed by lights in the trees, animals acting strange, electronics dying for no reason. The last time, my reflection didn\u2019t match me. Just for a second. But it smiled.\n\nI don\u2019t sleep anymore. Not really. I see their shape in the fog, in my windows at night, hovering just behind the glass. Watching. Measuring.\n\nWaiting for the countdown to end.\n\nAnd it\u2019s almost up.\n\nThey said I wasn\u2019t ready.\n\nBut I think we all will be\u2026 soon.\n\nAnd we won\u2019t have a choice.\n\nI\u2019ll keep you updated\u2026.if I\u2019m able.

The crowd around me is stunned, but shock can only go so far. \r\n\r\nI know it\u2019s coming, I don\u2019t know exactly what it\u2019s going to be, but this is a group of strong folks. They won\u2019t take my antics lying down.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s Milton, unable to watch me mutilate his friend, he levels a skull crushing kick my way. Sprinting from the crowd. \r\n\r\nThrough blurred vision and encroaching dark spots I still see it coming a mile off. My misfiring brain tries in vain to think of an option that doesn\u2019t throw another wrench into it\u2019s gears, but there isn\u2019t one. \r\n\r\nI try to tell myself it\u2019s actually stopping bloodshed. By doing something brutal enough, the crowd will submit. I won\u2019t have to watch Demi start tearing folks apart. \r\n\r\nIs that the truth though? Jesus Christ, saying I\u2019m going to mutilate someone because Jack the ripper needs me to, to save the world? Sounds a lot like Satan talking through my neighbor\u2019s dog, or needing to impress Jody Foster, doesn\u2019t it?\r\n\r\nBut none of that really matters in the moment. As the kick closes in, it\u2019s a matter of life and death. \r\n\r\nThe jagged end of my walking stick buries itself in a place that should have everyone with a Johnson crossing their legs right now. My brain feels hot, tears start to fall as Milton hits the ground. Child-like pained screams eating at the fabric of my sanity like starved moth larva. \r\n\r\nI can\u2019t cry, so I laugh, it\u2019s a tortured sound. As I get to my feet, I retch but disguise it as a creepy lurch. \r\n\r\nThe survivalist type takes a step, I wind my leg back like a soccer player. Ready to drive the walking stick further into the wounded man. \r\n\r\nI can\u2019t take this, the tension, the violence. I want so badly to cry. \r\n\r\nBut I can\u2019t.\r\n\r\n\u201cMilt there has about a 75% chance of survival if one of you know some basic first aid. Won\u2019t be any little Miltons, but whatever, the world has enough jocks, am I right?\u201d I say. I struggle to keep my voice even, I sound like an evil Emo Phillips, \u201c Anyone fucks around though, I\u2019ll kick that straight into his brain.\u201d\r\n\r\nI\u2019m bastardizing everything I know, everything I stand for. From clown college to fighting the good fight. \r\n\r\nThe worst part is, it\u2019s working. I\u2019m controlling this crowd, I\u2019m in their heads. Demi watching, enraptured. \r\n\r\n\u201cNow that the cat\u2019s out of the bag all of you need to understand something. \r\n\r\nThis little dance, I\u2019m just doing it for fun. Every so often, it\u2019s great to really get your hands in the soil, so to speak. \r\n\r\nI have abilities that\u2019d have you making graven idols if I showed them to you. Next person that wants to test me, it won\u2019t be skewered balls or a missing eye. I\u2019ll fuse the group of you together, rearrange the pieces, and let you wander this place till someone puts you out of your misery.\u201d My inflection is all wrong, but I only see a few people not buying it. \r\n\r\n\u201cMeat!\u201d I scream to Demi, \u201cYou grab Kyle. I\u2019m going to take a bit of a DBAA tax.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy voice is harsh and vile, I\u2019m hitting my stride. I lean into Demi\u2019s lie, and he gladly obliges, looking fearful at me as he starts to bind our target. \r\n\r\nThe crowd parts as I walk to the survivalist. \r\n\r\n\u201cFood, weapons, and ammo.\u201d I say.\r\n\r\nThe man takes off his jacket, and duffel. Then proceeds  to pull all manner of equipment and supplies from his pockets, adding it to the pile. \r\n\r\nI can\u2019t let him give everything up. They\u2019re going to be taking care of two wounded. I\u2019m supposed to seem like a monster, not be one. \r\n\r\n\u201cAre you trying to insult me?\u201d I say, cocking my head and fixing the man with a glare, \u201cI want some souvenirs, I\u2019m not looking for your charity.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor a moment I feel good about myself. It doesn\u2019t last as he removes a pistol, hunting knife and a handful of protein bars. \r\n\r\nSomething about the look he gives me, tells me the man doesn\u2019t quite believe my explanation.\r\n\r\nBefore we leave, I stop by the scrawny addict. \r\n\r\n\u201cHow much fun you have left in the bag?\u201d I say, looking to the man protectively clutching his treasure. \r\n\r\nHe pulls out three more bottles of liquor offering them to me. Clearly more than could fit in the small bag.  \r\n\r\n\u201cAs much as I need.\u201d He says defensively. \r\n\r\nWe make an Irish exit before fear turns to rage. The empty feeling backpack slung across my shoulder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cYou need to trust someone, kid.\u201d Eli says. \r\n\r\nMy mentor, and one of my only friends. He\u2019s a short old man, in his mid 80\u2019s and tougher than a two dollar steak. \r\n\r\n\u201cI know, but there aren\u2019t many good options. Everyone here is so, strange. Morality is all, fucking, grey.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s rich, coming from you.\u201d Eli says, shaking his head. \r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the problem. Here, I\u2019ve got nothing. I need someone to tell me when I\u2019m going off the rails. But in this place, there are no rails.\u201d I reply. \r\n\r\n\u201cMichael?\u201d Demi says. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m startled, I shake my head, and sure enough, Eli, is no where to be seen. \r\n\r\n\u201cJust thinking, sorry.\u201d I lie. \r\n\r\nI forgot how insidious hallucinations can be. How much they can camouflage themselves in a place like this. \r\n\r\n \u201cYour mind can\u2019t handle his domain.\u201d Kyle chides from behind us. \r\n\r\nDemi holds a long impromptu rope tied around the man\u2019s neck. \r\n\r\n\u201cListen here you docked-tail of a person. \r\n\r\nYou\u2019re alive right now because I want to get the information you have without taking you apart doing it. \r\n\r\nBecause, yes, this place is a whole lot of no-good for me. \r\n\r\nKeep being obnoxious though, it\u2019d be a lot quicker to just start taking pieces from you.\u201d I reply half-heartedly. \r\n\r\n\u201cYou can trust me Michael.\u201d Demi says a few minutes later. \r\n\r\n\u201cWas I talking out loud?\u201d I ask, embarrassed. \r\n\r\n\u201cMumbling, but keen ears and all.\u201d Demi replies. \r\n\r\n\u201cBack home my whole thing was going after guys like you. \r\n\r\nLife being what it is, I got dragged in a totally different direction, but the fact remains.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ve been in my head, you know this.\u201d I say. \r\n\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t go through your mind like a book Michael. If I could, I\u2019d have likely found a suitable lie long ago. \r\n\r\nBut as things stand now, maybe the truth would work a bit better?\u201d Demi asks. \r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got time.\u201d I say non-committedly. \r\n\r\nDemi opens his hand, a small hourglass appears in his palm. The top has sand as black as pitch, and is about 10 percent of the way full. In the bottom is pristine white sand. \r\n\r\nAs I watch it for a moment, I notice the sand isn\u2019t moving. \r\n\r\n\u201cI thought you said you didn\u2019t have your magic here?\u201d I say, annoyed. \r\n\r\n\u201cThis is something that I had made a part of me. Through great effort and pain, it\u2019s as much my essence as my memories. \r\n\r\nYou\u2019ve seen the imbued trash used by Leo and his ilk. You\u2019ve encountered objects of power, but there is more. \r\n\r\nThings so connected to the force of the world they simply are. They cannot be destroyed, they cannot be changed, and they were created by something that sits above all else. \r\n\r\nNo one knows what happens when you pass beyond the void, true death is just as much of a mystery to me as you. \r\n\r\nThis object, does one thing. It quantifies your actions. Good and evil. It weighs them against each other.\u201d Demi explains. \r\n\r\n\u201cAnd?\u201d I prod. \r\n\r\n\u201cKnowing something is out there keeping track, well, you could say it made me paranoid. \r\n\r\nMy willingness to help isn\u2019t out of some sense of altruism. Far from it. My goal is simple. \r\n\r\nI want to get out of this Karmic debt I\u2019ve built up. After that, I\u2019ll figure out a way to balance what I like to do with my fear of what is after.\u201d Demi replies. \r\n\r\nIs it a lie, is it the truth? I don\u2019t know. But I think that\u2019s less important than what I do understand about what Demi said. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s an admission. Whatever gift wrapping he decided to put over the idea, at it\u2019s core, I believe he believes that hourglass signals his fate. \r\n\r\nI don\u2019t reply. Not directly at least, but Demi picks up on my lack of vitriol as we walk. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThat one.\u201d Demi says, pointing to a patch of wide leaved, multi colored flora. \r\n\r\nI may not necessarily trust Demi, but I trust his opinion on what we\u2019re planning on doing next. \r\n\r\nWe walk Kyle to the edge of the plant life. Demi and I sit, I take out a couple of protein bars, and bottles of water, offering one of each to Kyle. \r\n\r\nHe sits, I can see the nervousness in his body language. In the way his eyes are darting around. \r\n\r\nDemi lets go of the leash. Far from relaxing our captive, it makes him sweat. \r\n\r\n\u201cEat, we\u2019ve been walking for almost a day.\u201d I say in a friendly tone. \r\n\r\nKyle looks suspicious. I pull a couple of 40\u2019s of beer from the junkie\u2019s backpack. \r\n\r\n\u201cYou smoke?\u201d I ask, pulling a pack from the endless bag. \r\n\r\n\u201cNot anymore.\u201d Kyle replies. \r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you won\u2019t mind if I do.\u201d I say, lighting a cigarette from a book of matches tucked inside the pack.\r\n\r\nI smoke, and eat, fighting off the temptation to drink the beer in front of me. \r\n\r\n\u201cYou want to make a deal.\u201d Kyle asserts, eventually. \r\n\r\nDemi laughs. \r\n\r\n\u201cWhat would you offer, if I was asking for a deal?\u201d I say.\r\n\r\n\u201cYour lives. I will make sure He knows you atoned for your mistakes.\u201d Kyle replies, his tone confident. \r\n\r\nI cup my hands around my mouth, screaming at the ground, \u201c Hey dickhead, I\u2019m right here and as of now, we have no idea how to stop you. \r\n\r\nOrder\u2019s up, pickled clown with a side of English-style serial killer.\u201d\r\n\r\nSeconds of silence. \r\n\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t seem \u2018He\u2019 is listening.\u201d Demi states, mockingly. \r\n\r\n\u201cIf I were to take a guess, your conversations are of a more one-sided variety. \r\n\r\nSo here\u2019s the situation. Not only do I not want to torture you, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be that effective. Am I right?\u201d I question. \r\n\r\nKyle grins, fresh wounds cracking and oozing blood, \u201cNothing you could do would sway me from my calling.\u201d.\r\n\r\n\u201cDamn, thought so.\u201d I say facetiously, \u201cDon\u2019t worry though I\u2019ve been thinking of a solution to that. \r\n\r\nDemi, what\u2019s fear?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a human reaction to the unknown.\u201d Demi says without missing a beat. \r\n\r\n\u201cA lot of people confuse fear with horror. Horror is what happens when you see something bad in front of you and you want to get away from it. \r\n\r\nI have a feeling you don\u2019t get effected too much by horror. You didn\u2019t blink back there when I was popping both types of balls in the human body. \r\n\r\nMakes sense, you have to know, sooner or later Big Daddy Sand is going to be snacking on you. \r\n\r\nThe plant life next to us is just full critters. No idea what they are, or what they can do, but Demi says they\u2019re not friendly.\u201d I threaten. \r\n\r\nI see the wheels turning in Kyle\u2019s brain.   \r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d walk into oblivion for He.\u201d Is the brainwashed athlete\u2019s reply. \r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you would, you\u2019re big, you\u2019re fast, you probably think you\u2019d have a chance in there. \r\n\r\nThat\u2019s hope. And it\u2019s a powerful drug, Kyle. Gives a whole lot of Dutch courage. \r\n\r\nCall me Narcan.\u201d I spit. \r\n\r\nYou pick up a lot of party tricks trying to find your niche in clowning. Never know what might impress the right crowd. \r\n\r\nWhich is my roundabout way of saying there are 3 options for breaking a beer bottle over someone\u2019s head. \r\n\r\nThe first, and safest is to bring a candy glass bottle. \r\n\r\nThe second requires a lot of practice, is likely to cause some minor cuts, and should only be done on yourself. Really, it should never be done because it\u2019s stupid, but we\u2019re comparing it to\u2026\r\n\r\nThe third, which is simply smashing one over someone\u2019s head and letting nature take it\u2019s course. \r\n\r\n Seeing as I haven\u2019t seen any candy glass, option one is off the table. I give myself a dose of option two, and leave option three for Kyle. \r\n\r\nHe screams, more from shock than pain as he tries to scramble away. I have a beer-soaked hand wrapped around his throat as I pin him to the ground. \r\n\r\nAlready I can hear wildlife within moving to the edges of the island of plant life. \r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going in alone. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m coming in with you. You might be able to outsmart or outrun whatever\u2019s in there, but all I\u2019ve got to do is slow you down just enough so they catch up.\u201d I rant. \r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d be killed alongside me.\u201d Kyle says smugly. \r\n\r\n\u201cAnd? I\u2019ve got us beer battered and smelling like some rare steaks. I\u2019d have thought me making death a group project would have been obvious.\u201d is my reply. \r\n\r\nKyle stays silent, calling my bluff. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately for him, I\u2019m not bluffing. \r\n\r\nMy head begins to pound, whispers at the edge of my hearing. I have to get my shit together. \r\n\r\nI snap back to reality, screaming. I shake my head, grabbing Kyle by the wrist. \r\n\r\nHe\u2019s bigger, he\u2019s stronger, but he\u2019s shocked, and scared. \r\n\r\nAlmost as much as I am. \r\n\r\nNone of the storm in my brain is helping. There is no dulling of the horror, no enjoying the bloodshed. Every noise, every sight gains an aura of death and evil beyond what it should. \r\n\r\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t come back, just remember, Demi, you\u2019re a murderous piece of shit, regardless of what god\u2019s wristwatch says.\u201d I say, dragging Kyle into the foliage. \r\n\r\nDecay, mold, and salt. The forest shimmers with unnatural colors in the sudden darkness. \r\n\r\n\u201cShit\u2019s getting spooky now, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I whisper venomously. \r\n\r\nKyle tries to get out of my grip. He freezes as he feels the barrel of my newly acquired pistol against his thigh. \r\n\r\n\u201cWhatever is coming for us, I can guarantee you won\u2019t want to face it with a missing kneecap.\u201d I whisper, looking around the alien landscape. \r\n\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d a voice, deep within the forest says. Something about it is, off, almost robotic. \r\n\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d, another deeper voice. \r\n\r\n\u201cHelp!\u201d, we hear from a different direction, small and childlike. \r\n\r\nMy heart pounds hard enough to make me nauseous. Fear induced sweat pours from me. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m betting my life on this guy cracking under the pressure. On the resolve of a zealot. But if Demi is right, my life won\u2019t mean a damn thing if I can\u2019t save my friends. \r\n\r\nMy eyes adjust and I can see the macabre scene. Horror never meant to be witnessed by the eyes of man. \r\n\r\nIn fungal growths bodies are fused with the thick, green trunked plants. Patches of skin and muscle removed, at first I think they\u2019re nothing more than corpses. But as I watch in horror, I see twitches, shallow, pained breaths. \r\n\r\nWhile most of the wounds seem random, each has had their neck flensed open. Veins intact, vocal chords exposed. \r\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t take me long to see the cause of this unfortunate fate. But my strained mind can\u2019t really comprehend it. \r\n\r\nIf I were to try and describe every deranged detail of these things, we\u2019d be here all night. And even then, I\u2019d never do them justice. \r\n\r\nThe entities are segmented but asymmetrical, slowly moving plated creatures somewhere on the Venn diagram of tortoise and insect. \r\n\r\nOne crawls up a body, spindly, curved legs moving just as quickly vertically as horizontally. \r\n\r\nA purple and yellow colored chitin plate falls backward, revealing a featureless black orb, with a thin, pointed proboscis. Hair-fine strands snake from beneath the armor plates and begin to prod at the poor soul\u2019s vocal cords. \r\n\r\nWith a wet, cracking noise the creature jams it\u2019s proboscis into it\u2019s victim\u2019s lung. \r\n\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d The half-corpse says. \r\n\r\nA migraine almost literally from hell starts to take root. My eyes throb, I lose focus. \r\n\r\nFor a second I see them, every life I\u2019ve I\u2019ve taken, or ruined. Eyes burning with hatred, they scream questions I can never answer. \r\n\r\nI bite the inside of my cheek hard enough I feel a dull crunch. Blood fills my mouth, pain brings me back to reality. \r\n\r\nI spit the mouthful of blood in the direction of what I\u2019ve dubbed \u2018Bagpipers\u2019, and whistle a sharp, shrill tone. \r\n\r\n\u201cOrders up boys, come and fucking get it!\u201d I scream. \r\n\r\nA half dozen of the hundred pound creatures begin to scuttle their way toward us. The leaves above us begin to shift and rattle. \r\n\r\nThe pathetic but resolute look on Kyles face hits me. The invasive thought of how he\u2019s just some putz roped into shit well beyond him starts to nag at my conscience. \r\n\r\nSomething hits my shoulder, I look down to see a tiny version of the bagpiper, one of the young, I\u2019m guessing. \r\n\r\nThe noise in the leaves. \r\n\r\nI watch as it extends those tiny fibers, almost whip-like. A quarter sized piece of cloth, skin and flesh disappears. The pain hits a full second afterward, as awful as it is, I play it up further. I scream like I\u2019ve been castrated. \r\n\r\nBut I notice something odd, the thumb sized creature recoils, dropping it\u2019s gram of flesh. I can\u2019t describe it\u2019s reaction better than saying it was like a cat eating a lemon. \r\n\r\nMore begin to fall, Kyle is struggling to avoid the lethal rain. \r\n\r\nI let go of his wrist, grabbing the young Bagpiper, and throwing it at the man. \r\n\r\nAs it hits him, blood spurts, the greedy, evil little thing begins burrowing just under his skin. \r\n\r\n\u201cInteresting.\u201d I say, wondering why they don\u2019t seem to have a taste for clown. \r\n\r\nKyle falls, the creature has crawled three long inches under his skin. I see the fight drain out of his eyes. \r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you anything, He will forgive me. Just let me get out of here!\u201d Kyle pleads. \r\n\r\nI drop to one knee crushing a Bagpiper. \r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, no, no. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m not getting out of here and having you stonewall me once your dick is out of the fire. \r\n\r\nGive me something I can use, then we can talk.\u201d I draw the stolen knife as I talk, \u201cBetter hurry, sounds like mom and dad are coming to see what all the fuss is about.\u201d\r\n\r\nKyle screams, then stammers, finally gritting his teeth and forcing out a sentence. \r\n\r\n\u201cHe seeks warmth. Everything he does is in search for it.\u201d Kyle says, one incisor chipping. \r\n\r\nI skewer the Bagpiper under his leg, tearing it out the way it came. \r\n\r\n\u201cTick-tock Kyle, that was a good start, but I need more than that.\u201d I whisper. \r\n\r\nI can\u2019t tell If I\u2019ve soaked through my clothes with sweat or pissed myself. Either way, I can nearly feel the reek coming off of me. \r\n\r\n\u201cThe lost, they placate him with crumbs. Cast offs from the wretched wanders. If you watch them you will find, He.\u201d Kyle says, struggling to his feet. \r\n\r\nI keep the pistol leveled at him, making a show of weighing the value of his information. The massive bagpipers break through a bush, all around us the island of flora echoes with cries of \u201cHello?\u201d and \u201cHelp!\u201d.\r\n\r\nKyle tears another young bagpiper from his arm screaming with the effort. \r\n\r\n\u201cOkay, you big baby, let\u2019s go.\u201d I say, trying to disguise my fear driven tremor as being eager to shoot. \r\n\r\nThe second his back is turned I\u2019m running. Putting as much distance between me and the Bagpipers as possible. \r\n\r\n Demi looks both shocked and relieved as we scramble out of the treeline. The Bagpipers stop dead where the wet soil turns to gravel, the forest still ringing with the cries of their victims. \r\n\r\nI lose a few seconds of time, I\u2019m sitting beside Demi, looking at Kyle from across a dimming fire. \r\n\r\n\u201cWe have to kill him. You know he\u2019s just going to come after us if we don\u2019t.\u201d Demi says. \r\n\r\n\u201cI did what you wanted!\u201d Kyle retorts. \r\n\r\nEvery word is like an icepick in my head. \r\n\r\nI say nothing, getting up and grabbing my seltzer bottle. \r\n\r\nI give Demi a smirk before I turn to Kyle. \r\n\r\nGod I want a drink. As I try to walk calmly, to drive down the tremors and misfiring nerves, I imagine how good that first shot would feel going down. \r\n\r\n\u201cWe made a\u2026\u201d Kyle begins, I spray him in the face. \r\n\r\n\u201cDo not open your eyes.\u201d I say cryptically, hoping he takes the bait. \r\n\r\nHe doesn\u2019t. \r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the third smart thing I\u2019ve seen you do. \r\n\r\nThat tingling, it\u2019s because this is a bottle of Sodium Acrylate. Super glue, to dumb it down a few notches. \r\n\r\nMade to fix cuts in Vietnam, yadda, yadda, yadda. \r\n\r\nIf you stay here, wait till things get hot, let it dry, you\u2019ll be able to peel it off. It\u2019s going to take some skin, but you\u2019re a tough guy, right?\r\n\r\nNow, if you\u2019re stupid enough to open your eyes, well, then things get interesting. You\u2019ll rip half of them out before you go into shock.\u201d I lie. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m not a religious guy, but I find myself praying to anything that feels like listening to make this guy believe me. If my brain was an engine, it\u2019d be spewing black smoke by now. \r\n\r\nWhether divine intervention or self preservation, Kyle believes my horseshit. By the time he works up the balls to check his face, we\u2019re long gone. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cSo now all we have to do is try to find something cold in a desert.\u201d Demi says as we follow a group of the lost. Their ramshackle vehicles moving at a turtle\u2019s pace. \r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the part I\u2019m not worried about.\u201d I say, reaching into the backpack and pulling out a bottle of computer duster. \r\n\r\nI turn it upside down, and a jet of freezing liquid dissipates against the hot gravel.  \r\n\r\n \u201cYou think it\u2019ll be enough?\u201d I ask, unsure. \r\n\r\n\u201cIt will, or it won\u2019t. It\u2019s what we have.\r\n\r\nOur goal is as much about the journey, the defiance, the battle of wills, as anything. \r\n\r\nThat being said, the will of whatever is below us, I can\u2019t see it being a small thing.\u201d Demi answers. \r\n\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the plan?\u201d I say, as the lost start to unload trunkfulls of junk into a massive pile. \r\n\r\n\u201cOne of us will need to go down there. As limber as you may be, the pit was dozens of feet, at least. So it will have to be me. \r\n\r\nI think I can manipulate that backpack enough to make a good show of things. It\u2019s workings seem simple enough. \r\n\r\nYou, do what you do best. Distract the thing. Confuse it if you can.\u201d Demi explains. \r\n\r\nI hate the perspective it gives me. I\u2019m a throwaway piece in this game.\r\n\r\nWith their cargo unloaded the lost push their vehicles to the limit, getting as far away from what happens next as possible. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a Grasping. Sets of long, clawed fingers work their way from the gravel. A widening pit appearing next to the pile of debris. \r\n\r\nTheir body language is greedy and perturbed, scraping the random objects into the widening maw.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo keep up.\u201d Demi says, sprinting toward the thing below the sand. \r\n\r\nI wish that was the zinger that started our plan working flawlessly, but it wasn\u2019t. \r\n\r\n\u201cThe bag!\u201d Demi yells twenty feet into our sprint to death. \r\n\r\nI grab the enchanted ( cursed?) thing, but as I wind back for the throw, something gives in my back. \r\n\r\nUnlike film, getting the shit kicked out of you while dehydrated and experiencing acute mental trauma doesn\u2019t make you invincible. My body, much like my mind betrays me. \r\n\r\nHe\u2019s far ahead of me by the time he looks back. That moment of lost focus is all it took though. \r\n\r\nIt knows we\u2019re here. \r\n\r\nDemi barely avoids a massive claw, more come his way, and he scrambles to avoid the impending doom. \r\n\r\nI see him, about to dive into the pit, then the unexpected happens. \r\n\r\nTons upon tons of flesh, junk and plant life vomits from the ground. It\u2019s a singular, forming mass, like a building sized organ suddenly prolapsing. \r\n\r\nCrude, rough features begin to take shape, a child\u2019s cutout of a face tops a necrotic amalgam of flesh and stolen possessions.\r\n\r\nThe clawed fingers ring the body by the dozen. Demi, shocked at the thing is dealt a glancing blow, it sends him skittering across the gravel like a toy. \r\n\r\nI can stand, I can move, but I\u2019m sure as hell not doing anything quickly. \r\n\r\nI start to laugh, or maybe cry. At the moment I don\u2019t really know the difference. I see the futility of everything in the behemoth in front of me. \r\n\r\n   But I keep putting one foot in front of the other, there\u2019s no taking back the decisions I\u2019ve made.\r\n\r\nThe creature is focussed on Demi, I get in range, and throw a can of duster toward the creature. A shot from the pistol bursts it against the thing\u2019s misbegotten flesh. \r\n\r\nFor a second, I see a hole, but before I can even judge the size it\u2019s filled in with more unholy mass. \r\n\r\nMight as well have spat on the thing. \r\n\r\nDespite his speed, despite his strength, Demi doesn\u2019t have long. \r\n\r\nSo, this is where I die then. \r\n\r\nI chase a quarter bottle of vodka with a long haul from the computer duster. When you have 5 minutes to live, no sense in going for your one year chip. \r\n\r\nThe toxins dull my hearing, the booze makes things feel far away. This is going to hurt like a motherfucker. \r\n\r\nI stand in front of a flesh wall enforced with all manner of materials. I snap the tops off of two cans of duster, aiming the freezing jets ahead of me. \r\n\r\nIt cuts through the thing like boiling water through sugar, but the damage is superficial at best. \r\n\r\nI need to get deeper. \r\n\r\nI wade into the thing as Demi fights for his life. \r\n\r\nPressure, crushing, from all sides. Flesh and debris press in as fast as the CO2 can destroy it. I press forward, as much of the freezing liquid spraying on me as the flesh around me. \r\n\r\nThe cracks in my mind turn to fissures, every step forward a test of endurance and pain tolerance. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a blur, I feel my hair torn from my skull, a finger breaks, my leg is twisted at an ungodly angle, but I keep moving forward. \r\n\r\nThe flesh around me begins to change from a sickening yellow to a deep crimson. \r\n\r\nI feel it, more than hear it. \r\n\r\nHe, screams. \r\n\r\nI grip the backpack with bloody fingers, spraying CO2 like holy water through the thinning muscle of this abomination. \r\n\r\nI lose the tip of my nose and part of my chin to the freezing liquid, but eventually tear through to somewhere cavernous. \r\n\r\nAll around me twisted mixes of organs and machine pump and churn. It\u2019s hot as hell. \r\n\r\nIn the centre of it all stands a figure, naked, sexless, but almost human. \r\n\r\nI lurch forward, one leg locked, prodding torn lips with a split tongue. \r\n\r\n\u201cIf you kill me, this place will become overran. I am it\u2019s heart, I am the conundrum, the starving, the bloated. \r\n\r\nI am the only person that never was.\r\n\r\nThis place will become nothing more than an abattoir of souls.\u201d It says. \r\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t walk, the fleshy ground below it simply glides it forward. \r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not lying, are you?\u201d I say as I stand face to face with the lithe thing. \r\n\r\n\u201cEvery accidental wanderer, every person destined to nothing more than a few hours of horror, they will die. From now until eternity.\u201d He replies. \r\n\r\nThe smile I give it, puts a look of shock on it\u2019s warped face. \r\n\r\n\u201cOh no, that\u2019ll probably drive me moderately more, insane.\u201d I taunt, \u201cThe thing is, no one else will ever know. I\u2019ll take that secret to my fucking grave. Which I\u2019ll probably be tucked into in about five minutes here.\r\n\r\nI get it now, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d\r\n\r\nLong, bone shafted, steel tipped barbs start to extend from the walls. \r\n\r\n\u201cI can let you escape, your friend too.\u201d He offers. \r\n\r\nMy answer is to reach into the bag. This time though, I turn it inside out. \r\n\r\nI feel like I\u2019ve been hit by a train, in an instant the world around me is a hailstorm of cans. Sounds of rupture like ricochets start to chain together as the thousands upon thousands of cans collide. \r\n\r\nA scream that shakes my soul, pain, hot blood, searing cold. It\u2019s a storm and an earthquake all at once. \r\n\r\nA sharp blow, the world goes black, this is the end. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cMichael!\u201d I hear, muffled. Arms like steel dragging me from rotting flesh and rusted steel. \r\n\r\nI see the alien sky above me, and through all the mental fog I find I\u2019m happy to still be alive. \r\n\r\nExpect to hear from Punch next week, I don\u2019t know how much sense I\u2019m going to be making in the near future. \r\n\r\nThanks for listening. \r\n\r\nMike \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"},"98":{"title":"Don't Trust HR. My Performance Review Nearly Killed Me.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kejx3u\/dont_trust_hr_my_performance_review_nearly_killed\/","flair":null,"author":"Accomplished_Low7889","selftext":"I had just opened my laptop when the HR email landed in my inbox:\u00a0\n\n*\"Your Performance Review is scheduled to begin. Please present yourself to Office 3 tomorrow at 8:00 AM for the calibration procedure.\"*\u00a0\n\nCalibration. The word buzzed with possibility.\n\nThis wasn't just any performance review; this was *the* review, the yearly one that would hopefully catapult me into a senior role. Operations, perhaps.\u00a0\n\nThe word alone felt far more exciting than the financial spreadsheets and SQL queries I\u2019d spent the last year working on. And my boss was from Operations, a realm of decisions and action I desperately wanted to join.\n\nJust as the clock ticked past five, he appeared at my cubicle, a wide grin splitting his face. He leaned against the fabric wall, his weight shifted slightly due to the pronounced limp in his gait \u2013 a souvenir, he'd once mentioned, from a hiking accident that had cost part of his leg.\n\n\"Well, well,\" he said, clapping me on the shoulder. \"Big day tomorrow, huh? Don't let me down.\"\u00a0\n\nI gave him a half-smile, my gaze drawn to his company badge. An imposing black, so different from the sea of blue worn by us junior staff. I just wished I had one like that for myself.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe big day came, and I arrived early at Office 3.\u00a0\n\nIt was in a part of town I'd never been to, a somewhat isolated area near the port, with not much else around.\u00a0\n\nIt struck me then, not for the first time, that despite the time at the job, I couldn't quite articulate what it was the company did.\u00a0\n\nThe specifics of our products were shrouded in secrecy; all we knew were the government contracts and sensitive technology. Security, I was told. Maybe with a promotion, the fog would finally lift.\n\nStepping into the waiting room, marked by a large \"HR\" sign, I was met by a stern-faced secretary who simply gestured for me to sit. Three other employees were already present.\n\nOne was Emma, a sweet, young woman from IT. We'd exchanged polite nods in the hallways before. She offered me a bright smile, the first to break the tension in the room.\u00a0\n\nAn older man, probably in his late fifties with graying hair, sat silently nearby; I knew him from the accounting department. There was also a third person, someone I'd seen around the office but didn't know \u2013 an engineer, I believe. He kept to himself, looking around with a similar air of unease.\n\nA knot tightened in my stomach. Were we all competing for the same promotion? The email had been vague about the process. The secretary finally rose and motioned for us to follow.\u00a0\n\nWe navigated a series of dim corridors until we reached a wooden door. She opened it just enough for us to pass through and tersely instructed us to \"step in.\"\n\nA shared, confused glance passed between the four of us before we complied. The door shut behind with a thud.\n\nThe room we entered was vast, the size of a tennis court. A metal framework dominated the space, and above us, harsh lights and a half-dozen cameras were fixed. Along the side, a panel of glass stood out.\n\nMy eyes focused on the glass, and I noticed something strange. On the other side I could see my boss and other department managers I recognized. They sat in comfortable chairs, watching us.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAnd my boss was the first to get up to approach a computer located near the glass.\u00a0\n\nHe took his black badge, swiped it somewhere and picked up a microphone attached to the console.\n\n\"This is a performance review and the calibration process for promotion to Operations Manager of the second region \u2013 my position,\" he began, his voice amplified through the sound system. \"Please proceed to one of the panels. The streaming starts now.\"\n\nA red light illuminated on the cameras. They were recording us.\n\nIn the center of the room, four panels were arranged in a tight circle, each screen facing inward like part of a bizarre game show. A small hole was visible in each panel, and a white circle on the floor indicated where I assumed we should stand.\n\nWe approached, a wave of nervousness washing over us. No one seemed to have any idea what was going on.\n\n\"Please position yourselves at the white circle,\" my boss instructed, and we obeyed.\n\nOnce the four of us were standing within the marked area, he continued. \"The process will be divided into three stages, and may be extended until we have a selected candidate. The first stage is called *Screening,* and it\u2019s just a form requesting your information and resume details. Please fill it out accurately and, no matter what, don't lie.\"\n\nOn my panel, a form appeared, filled with a variety of professional and even personal questions.\n\n\"Are you married?\" \"What other languages do you know?\" \"What's your level in dealing with complex data?\"\n\nAbout twenty compressed questions appeared on the touchscreen, which we answered in silence. I filled it all out and tapped \"Done.\" The rest of the candidates soon finished.\n\n\"Very good,\" my boss said through the microphone. \"Now the data will be analyzed before the next phase.\"\n\nWe waited for about ten anxious minutes, watching my boss check some stuff on the computer, analyzing it and occasionally discussing something with the other department heads.\n\nThen he finally returned to the microphone. \"Candidate William, you are eliminated from the process for lying.\"\n\nWe heard a thud from the side of the engineer, the one I didn't know well. He collapsed, smoke rising from his forehead\u2014like he\u2019d been shot.\n\nEmma let out a sharp scream of shock. The older accounting man and I remained silent, our faces drained of color.\n\nWhen I snapped out of it and went to try and help the engineer, I heard my boss's voice cutting through.\n\n\"Stop right there,\" he commanded, and through the glass, I saw him looking directly at me. \"There's a gun above your panel that's aimed directly at your head. If any of you step out of the white circle, you are terminated. Candidate William lied in his form and paid the price. It's a 100% confirmed lie, based on our analysis. No cheating will be allowed in this process.\"\n\nMy body stiffened. I stared at the hole in the terminal\u2014there was definitely a barrel in it, pointed straight at me.\n\n\"Now,\" my boss continued. \"Let's move on to phase 2.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nEmma was sobbing uncontrollably, her whole body trembling with fear as my boss recited the rules for the next stage.\n\n\"We\u2019ll proceed to *Company Knowledge.* It\u2019s a quiz to determine who truly understands the company's core principles and key results,\" he stated flatly, as if reading from a script. \"I will make ten statements. You will have five seconds to answer true or false on your terminal. The one with the most incorrect answers at the end will be terminated.\"\n\nBefore we could even process the information, he delivered the first statement.\n\n*\"Integrity is one of our five principles.\"*\n\nTrue or false appeared on my screen. We three exchanged panicked glances for a split second. Luckily, I knew this one. \"True!\" I blurted out.\n\nWe all tapped our screens, and a moment later, a green confirmation flashed on mine.\n\nThe next few statements came in rapid succession. \"*Our primary client is the Department of Defense*\" (True, I remembered seeing that in some document). \"*Our CEO has been with the company for over twenty years*\" (False, Emma got that one). \"*Sustainability is a major focus in our operational guidelines*\" (False, the older man confirmed).\n\nEach time, one of us had the right answer or an educated guess to share out loud with the rest. A fragile sense of camaraderie formed amidst the fear of what would happen to the loser.\n\nEmma, though clearly terrified, tried her best to keep up, her brow furrowed in concentration. The older man remained largely quiet, his answers appearing on his screen just a fraction of a second after ours.\n\nWe managed to get through nine sentences this way, leading to nine correct answers for the three of us.\n\nFinally came the tenth: \"*Our year-over-year revenue growth was 14% last year*\"\u00a0\n\nA wave of uncertainty hit. I didn\u2019t recall seeing that specific figure anywhere. Emma looked lost, and the older man's face remained impassive.\n\nThen, the man suddenly declared, \"True.\"\n\nEmma, trusting his apparent certainty, quickly tapped \"True\" on her screen.\u00a0\n\nMy finger hovered over the options. \"True\" felt plausible, but something nagged at the back of my mind \u2013 a half-forgotten chart in a financial report. At the very last second, I realized it couldn\u2019t be 14%. It was closer to 9%.\n\nI slammed my finger down on \"False.\"\n\nI glanced at the older man. There was a flicker in his eyes, a brief, almost imperceptible glint of something that looked like\u2026 satisfaction? He had known. He had deliberately given the wrong answer.\n\nThe boss's voice echoed through the room. \"Two candidates answered all questions correctly. Candidate Emma, with nine correct answers, is eliminated from the process.\"\n\nA heavy silence descended. Emma gasped, her eyes met mine for a fleeting second, and then I heard it again. The thud.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAs her body fell heavily to the floor, a surge of rage filled my chest.\n\n\"You can\u2019t do this!\" I shouted, confronting my boss in a fit of fury. He ignored my outburst and indicated that the next stage was about to begin.\n\nFor a moment, I considered running to the door as fast as I could. But then I glanced back at the hole in the terminal, the reminder of how quickly the others had been killed.\n\nI turned to the older man, anger lacing my voice. \"Why did you give her the wrong answer?\" He also offered no reply, only a cold, unwavering stare.\n\n\u201cThe next phase will now begin,\u201d the sound echoed. \u201cIt is called *'Sheer Will*,' and it will test each participant's true desire for the promotion.\"\n\nThe other managers rose from their comfortable chairs and approached the glass, their anticipation palpable, as if this were the highlight of the event.\n\nMy boss typed something into the computer and swiped his badge again. This time, the panel structure lid in front of us slid open, revealing an object.\n\nIt was a\u2026 baseball bat. Its end was studded with spikes and nails. A deadly weapon.\n\n\"The rules are simple,\" his voice echoed. \"The last one standing gets the job. You may begin.\"\n\nI stared at the object, frozen in disbelief. When I finally registered what was going on, the older man was already charging towards me, a mix of determination and desperation in his eyes, the spiked bat raised in hand.\n\nWhat followed happened so fast I can't explain it.\n\nI snatched up the bat just as he swung his own. I raised my hand to block the blow\u2014instinctively. The nails tore through my skin, searing pain exploding as the bat got stuck in my palm, stopping a second hit.\n\nWith my other arm, gripping my own weapon, I retaliated with a single upward swing that pierced his jaw and neck.\n\nThirty seconds after my boss's announcement, the man laid on the floor with his neck open, gasping for air. I sank down beside him, in shock.\n\nThen I heard the clapping.\u00a0\n\nThe other managers who had been watching were now cheering and applauding as if it were a sports show. The recording cameras had shifted to a lower angle, providing a gruesome close-up of me.\n\nMy boss had vanished from behind the glass but reappeared at the wooden door, limping towards me. I sat numbly on the floor, my shirt now stained with droplets of blood. As he got close, he helped me to my feet.\n\n\"Kid, you did much better than I did,\" he said, gesturing to his leg and glancing at my mangled hand. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d\n\nMy gaze kept going back to Emma's lifeless body.\n\nThen he removed his badge, the black one I had always admired, and placed it around my neck.\u00a0\n\n\"You'll be an incredible manager,\" he stated before turning and walking away.\n\n"},"99":{"title":"There's a man who stands on the abandoned roof across from my window every night watching the sky.

My balcony and my bedroom window look out over the street and directly at an old, abandoned house on the other side. It's been sealed up for years; nobody goes in, nobody comes out. The windows are broken, the main door is padlocked shut, and the whole place just radiates decay.\n\nThis whole thing started about\u2026 maybe three or four months ago. Like usual, I was staying up a bit late on the balcony, maybe having a smoke or a cup of tea before heading to bed. One night, I noticed a silhouette standing on the roof of that abandoned house. At first, I didn't process it, couldn't quite make it out. It was pretty dark, but the streetlights cast enough illumination over the area. I focused a little harder\u2026 No, that was definitely a person. A man, standing there.\n\nI was immediately confused. This house is locked up tight; no one ever goes near it. Who would be climbing onto its roof? And how? My first thought was maybe it was just some local kids messing around. But this man was standing perfectly still. Not moving at all. And stranger still\u2026 he was looking up. At the sky. His head was tilted back as if he were stargazing or\u2026 or I honestly don\u2019t know what he was doing.\n\nI watched him for about five minutes. He didn't budge. Stood there like a statue, gazing upwards. He looked completely ordinary, by the way. Wearing normal clothes \u2013 pants and a shirt or t-shirt, hard to tell exactly from the distance and in the dim light. His build was average, not particularly large or thin. But what was strange and unsettling, apart from his presence there, was that I couldn't see his face at all. His head was tilted back at such an angle that no matter how I tried, I could only maybe make out his chin and the back of his hair.\n\nI felt a little uneasy, went inside, locked the balcony door, and went to sleep. The next day, I\u2019d mostly forgotten about it. Until that night. Around the same time, I stepped out onto the balcony\u2026 and there he was. Standing in the exact same spot, in the exact same pose, looking up at the sky. This time, I felt a genuine sense of dread. Who was this? What was he doing every night on the roof of a locked, abandoned house? And why did he just keep staring at the sky like that?\n\nI didn\u2019t sleep well that night. My mind kept racing. Maybe a burglar scouting the area? But there\u2019s nothing to steal in that ruin. Maybe someone mentally unwell? Maybe someone\u2026 I didn\u2019t know. The next morning, on my way to work, I made a point of looking closely at the abandoned house. No sign of anyone. The door was still padlocked; the windows were still broken. No indication that anyone had been coming or going.\n\nThis became a pattern. Every single night. The same man, the same spot on the roof, the same posture, looking up at the sky. He never missed a night. He became a part of my nightly routine, a deeply unsettling part. Sometimes I\u2019d go out onto the balcony specifically to see if he was there. Other times, I\u2019d avoid the balcony altogether, staying in my room, terrified to even glance out the window and find him standing there.\n\nI started to feel real anxiety. This wasn't normal. I began asking around the neighborhood, subtly. I went down to talk to Mr. Henderson, the superintendent of my building, an older guy who\u2019s lived in the area forever.\n\n\u201cHey, Mr. Henderson, can I ask you something?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure thing. What\u2019s up?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat abandoned house across the street\u2026 does anyone ever go up on its roof at night?\u201d\n\nMr. Henderson looked at me like I had two heads. \n\n\u201cThe roof? What roof? That place is a wreck, son. Been boarded up for more than twenty years. Nobody can get up on that roof anyway. The inside staircase collapsed years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure, Mr. Henderson? Because I thought I\u2026\u201d \n\nI trailed off. What was I going to say? That I see a guy standing there looking at the sky every night? He\u2019d think I was crazy.\n\n\u201cPositive. I\u2019ve been here long before you moved in. Nobody goes near that house.\u201d\n\nI just said okay, thanked him, and went back upstairs feeling like something was seriously wrong. Either Mr. Henderson wasn't paying attention, or\u2026 or I was hallucinating.\n\nI went to the small convenience store down the block. Asked the guy behind the counter the same question, but indirectly.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the story with that boarded-up house, anyway? Looks kind of creepy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that was old Mr. Abernathy\u2019s place\u2026 died, him and his wife, in an accident years back. Kids sold it to someone who just let it sit, then they moved away. Place is probably haunted\u201d \n\nhe said that last part with a little smirk.\n\n\u201cHaunted? Haunted by what?\u201d\n\n\u201cGhosts, spirits\u2026 you know, local talk. Point is, nobody goes near it after dark.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight\u2026 Have you ever seen anyone strange hanging around it? Maybe lurking nearby? Or\u2026 on the roof, maybe?\u201d\n\nThe shopkeeper laughed. \n\n\u201cThe roof? Who\u2019d be able to get up there? Nah, nobody goes near it. You seen something?\u201d\n\nI felt like if I told him, he\u2019d either laugh at me or get spooked. I just said,\n\n \u201cNo, no, just asking. It looks weird.\u201d\n\n And I left.\n\nI sat with myself, thinking. Nobody sees him but me? How is that possible? Am I imagining it? But I see him so clearly every night. Standing right there. A physical presence. So why doesn\u2019t anyone else see him? Does he only appear to me? Why?\n\nThese questions started eating away at me. I wasn't sleeping properly anymore. I was constantly anxious and tense. Every time evening approached, my heart would start beating faster. I\u2019d approach the window hesitantly. Look out cautiously\u2026 and find him. Standing in his spot. Looking at the sky.\n\nI started observing him more intently. Trying to notice any detail. His clothes were almost always the same. His posture never changed. He never moved at all. Like a mannequin placed up there. Sometimes I\u2019d stare at him for hours, waiting for any movement, any change. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. But the feeling of anxiety and suspicion grew stronger inside me. There was something fundamentally wrong about this man, about his stance, and about the fact that nobody else seemed to see him.\n\nAnother month passed like this. I was nearing a nervous breakdown. I felt like I was officially losing my mind. I considered seeing a therapist. But I was scared. Scared they\u2019d lock me up or put me on medication that would numb me. More importantly, I had this gut feeling that this was real. Not delusions. Something was happening, and I was the only one witnessing it.\n\nI started considering wild explanations. Was he a ghost? Some kind of spirit? But if so, why just stand there looking at the sky? The ghosts and spirits you hear about usually try to scare people, harm them, make noises. This figure was completely silent, seemingly peaceful. But his very existence had become terrifying to me. Terrifying because of the mystery surrounding him, and because of the feeling that I was the only person on Earth who could see him.\n\nThat sense of isolation was crushing. Like there was a secret between me and this entity, a secret nobody else in the world knew. Did he know I was watching? No, impossible. He was always looking up. He never once looked towards me or anywhere else. His entire focus was on the sky.\n\nLast night\u2026 the moon was incredibly bright. A full moon, lighting up the street almost like daylight. I went out onto the balcony, tense as usual. And I looked towards the abandoned house. There he was. Standing in his spot. The moonlight revealed him more clearly than ever before. I could see more details in his clothes. Dark jeans and a plain white t-shirt. His hair seemed dark, maybe a bit thick. But his face\u2026 still couldn't see it. Head tilted sharply upwards.\n\nIn that moment, I don\u2019t know what came over me. Maybe it was desperation, maybe temporary insanity, maybe just the overwhelming need to break this stalemate and find out the truth. I found myself looking around the balcony. There were a few loose bricks and stones piled in a corner, left over from some old building repairs nobody ever cleared away.\n\nThe demon of curiosity, or maybe madness, whispered to me. If I threw something near him\u2026 would he look? Would he move? Would I finally know if he was real and not just a figment of my stressed-out mind? But then, if he was real and nobody else could see him, that was an even bigger problem. But I wasn\u2019t thinking logically anymore. I just wanted any reaction. Any proof.\n\nI bent down, picked up a smallish stone, about the size of my fist. My heart was pounding like a drum against my ribs. My hand was shaking. I looked at him again. Still standing there, looking at the sky, lost in his celestial contemplation.\n\nI took a deep breath, raised my arm\u2026 and threw the stone. I wasn\u2019t trying to hit him, of course. I aimed it so it would land on the roof beside him. Just to make a sound, hoping he\u2019d turn.\n\nI watched the stone arc through the moonlit air, like it was moving in slow motion. It landed with a soft thud on the rooftop of the abandoned house, maybe a yard or two away from where he stood.\n\nIn that instant\u2026 everything stopped. The ambient sounds of the street faded from my ears. The breath caught in my chest. My entire focus locked onto him.\n\nFor the first time in months\u2026 he moved.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t move the way I expected. He didn\u2019t quickly lower his head to investigate the source of the sound. No. His head lowered with agonizing slowness. A terrifying, unnatural slowness. Like the neck of a machine turning on rusty gears. Degree by degree\u2026 centimeter by centimeter\u2026 his head descended and began to turn towards me. Towards my balcony.\n\nMy heart felt like it was going to stop. I wanted to scream and run and hide, but my body was frozen in place. I couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t tear my eyes away from him.\n\nHis head completed its turn until it was facing me directly. And for the first time in months\u2026 I saw his face. Or what should have been his face.\n\nIn the shadows beneath his previously raised head, there weren't distinct features. But there was something else. Something that made my blood run cold and my knees buckle.\n\nHis eyes.\n\nHis eyes were glowing.\n\nNot just reflecting the moonlight. No. They were emitting a strong, white light. Like two small, intense flashlights aimed directly at me. A cold, terrifying light, devoid of any life or expression. Just pure white light pouring out from where his eyes should be.\n\nThe moment my gaze met his\u2026 or met the light emanating from his eyes\u2026 I felt an electric shock surge through my entire body. Raw, primal terror, unlike anything I had ever known. A feeling that this entity wasn\u2019t just strange or mysterious\u2026 it was dangerous. Extremely dangerous.\n\nI don\u2019t know how my legs carried me. I found myself scrambling back into the apartment like a madman, slamming the balcony door shut, rattling down the blinds, pulling the curtains closed. I ran to the front door, checked that it was securely locked. I went around to every window in the apartment, shutting them, closing all the curtains. I was breathing heavily, my heartbeat echoing in my ears. Sweat drenched me, and I was trembling like a leaf.\n\nI ended up sitting in the middle of the dark living room, hugging my knees to my chest, shaking uncontrollably. My mind couldn\u2019t process what I had seen. Those glowing eyes\u2026 that wasn't human. That wasn't natural. That was something else entirely. Something I had been watching for months, thinking it was unaware\u2026 or I hoped it was unaware.\n\nAfter some time, I don\u2019t know how long, maybe an hour or more, with fear completely paralyzing me, I started to calm down just a little. But the terror didn't leave. I decided I had to look again. I had to know if he was still there or if he\u2019d left. Maybe what I saw was a hallucination brought on by extreme fear and stress?\n\nI crept towards my bedroom window with extreme caution. I opened a tiny sliver of the curtain, just enough to see out without being seen. My heart started hammering again. I looked towards the roof of the abandoned house\u2026\n\nNobody.\n\nThe roof was empty. The spot where he always stood showed no trace of him.\n\nI felt a momentary wave of relief\u2026 immediately followed by a much larger wave of dread. Where did he go? Did he vanish? Did he come down? But how could he come down when the house was sealed?\n\nMy eyes scanned the area around the abandoned house\u2026 and suddenly\u2026 I caught movement.\n\nNot on the roof of the abandoned house. No.\n\nOn the roof of the building next door to mine. My neighbor's building, in the same row as my apartment block. Much, much closer.\n\nMy stomach dropped.\n\nIt was him. The same man. The same clothes. Standing with the same stillness. But this time\u2026 he wasn't looking at the sky.\n\nHe was looking directly at me.\n\nStanding on my neighbor's roof, which is practically adjacent to my building, his face turned directly towards my apartment window. And his eyes\u2026 they were still glowing with that same cold, terrifying white light. As if he knew exactly where I was peering from behind the curtain. As if he was saying:\n\n \"I saw you. And I know you see me. And I know where you are.\"\n\nI yanked the curtain shut instantly and stumbled backward, feeling nauseous. The terror I felt in that moment was exponentially worse than the initial fear. Before, he was a distant, mysterious entity. Now, he was a terrifying entity, close by, aware of my existence, and aware of my location.\n\nIt's my fault. I'm the one who drew his attention. With my stupid, impulsive action, throwing that stone, I made him look at me, made him discover me. He was just standing there, minding his own business, looking at the sky, and nobody noticed him but me, and like an idiot, I was watching him. Now he's the one watching back. But his gaze says it's not just watching.\n\nI've been holed up in my apartment for two days now. I don't open windows or the balcony door. All the curtains are drawn. I'm afraid to even get close to any opening to the outside world. I ordered food delivery and opened the door terrified, peering frantically down the hallway. I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see that white light pouring from his eyes, staring at me.\n\nI can feel him. I feel like he's still out there. Standing on the neighbors' roof, waiting for me to make a mistake and open a curtain, waiting for me to show myself. I feel his gaze penetrating the walls.\n\nI don't know what to do. Call the police? Tell them what? There's a guy with glowing eyes standing on my neighbor's roof staring at me? They'll think I'm on drugs or certifiably insane. Who can I tell? Who would believe me?\n\nI wrote all this down here because I feel like I'll go crazy if I keep it inside. Maybe someone here has gone through something similar? Maybe someone knows what this could be? Any explanation? Any advice?\n\nI'm so scared. Scared of what comes next. Scared that he won't just keep standing there looking. I feel like this was just the beginning. And that what I did opened a door I'm not remotely prepared to deal with.\n\nI think I hear faint footsteps on the stairs outside my apartment door right now\u2026 No, no, I must be imagining it\u2026 There's nothing there\u2026 right?\n\nI have to go now. I need to turn off the lights and stay quiet. Please, God, help me."},"193":{"title":"There\u2019s a coven at our wellness retreat.

I urge you not to attend the Wellness Retreat in the Pacific Northwest. The cult, or coven\u2026 whatever they are, put us under some spell. Their elder spewed something black and nefarious into my girlfriend\u2019s mouth. Things got much, much worse from there.\n\n\n\n\u2022\u2022\n\n\n\nWe arrived for our first day at the Wellness Retreat on the Pacific Northwest coast. We\u2019d been looking forward to decompressing from our busy, stressful lives in the city. My girlfriend, Aubrey, signed us up for the chanting ritual and forest bathing sessions, our favorite activities from the mindfulness and meditation package.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOur first chanting session at the yurt in the woods was starting soon, so we slipped on our favorite athleisure outfits, tied our hair up, and headed out the door.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWe reached the signpost near the trailhead and followed the winding path that cut through the cedar, pine, and maple trees. The forest felt ominous, almost threatening. The only sounds came from our feet stomping the fallen leaves beneath us.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWe navigated further down the path, finally spotting the yurt in the distance. Its walls were held together by intertwining, twisted branches and packed earth. I could see the flickering of warm candlelight dancing across the walls inside the edifice. As we approached, luminaries lined the path into the gaping mouth of the structure\u2014a calm, glowing welcome. The dome was coral blue, contrasting the forest's deep greens and browns. The exterior walls were decorated with paintings and symbols.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWhen we stepped inside, the spiritual guide greeted us. Her piercing, stone grey eyes peered into mine. It felt like she could read my thoughts and gaze into my soul. She had long, frail hair that fell wildly down to her waist. Her face appeared sunken, almost sickly, and her harsh cheekbones were sharp.\n\n\n\nShe handed us each a cup of tea and requested we drink it before the chanting ceremony began. The contents were a dark, black liquid adorned with gnarled stems and roots. I leaned in to smell the brew and quickly regretted my decision. The stench was putrid, almost nauseating.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAubrey gulped hers down first. I took a deep breath to work up the courage, and finally tipped back my cup. It tasted even worse than it smelled. The liquid flowed down my throat like razors, and my mouth felt like it was on fire.\n\n\n\n\u201cShould we go in for seconds?\u201d I snarkily remarked as I choked it down. Aubrey chuckled a bit out of sympathy; her face was grimacing and contorted from consuming the concoction as we moved further inside the room to join the other guests.\n\n\n\nThe old woman crept toward the center of the space. Aubrey and I maintained our focus on her as she began chanting in a raspy, monotone voice while she poured some of the rancid black liquid into her bowl.\n\n  \n\n\n*\u201cOm namah Shivaya. Ra ma da sssaaaa!\u201d*\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nThe elder paused for a moment, scanning the room. The air was heavy and suffocating, and her chant felt like a vacuum slurping up the oxygen in the chamber. She raised the ceremonial bowl, extending her arms to the dark sky above, and offered it to the large opening in the structure's ceiling.\n\n  \n\n\n\u201cWe invoke you, Mother! Cleanse our souls and consume our burdens!\u201d\n\n  \n\n\nThe other guests began rehearsing lines. Their bodies swaying slightly to the cadence of the script, as if under a spell, crying out, \u201cOh Mother, we love you so!\u201d\n\n  \n\n\nSuddenly, a swift breeze drove through the space, extinguishing the flickering candles. A wave of unease came over me. I started to feel nauseous, my vision blurred, and my ears began to ring slightly.\n\n  \n\n\nI looked over at Aubrey. She was shaking. Violently.\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nHer eyes had rolled back in her head, exposing only white. She began foaming at the mouth and convulsing as she crumpled toward the floor.\n\n\n\nThe elder woman leading the ceremony rushed over and crouched beside Aubrey. She leaned in, grabbing Aubrey\u2019s face with her spindly fingers. The woman\u2019s long, brittle hair created a canopy that engulfed them both.\n\n\n\nI watched in horror as the elder slowly opened her jaws, the skin beyond her lips tearing at the corners as her maw extended unnaturally wide. She extended her fingers. Her jagged, twisted nails reached into Aubrey\u2019s mouth, forcing her jaw open, and began spewing a black secretion down her throat.\n\n\n\nI tried to scream. Tried to move. Tried crying out for help. *Nothing.*\n\n\n\nMy vision was getting blurrier, now a narrow, darkening tunnel. I tried reaching out to Aubrey again, grasping at the air, but the concoction had taken hold of me. I was sinking further and further from consciousness.\n\n\n\nThen everything went black.\n\n\n\n\u2022\u2022\n\n\n\nI woke up in bed, my head pounding. The room swallowed all light and sound. I looked out the window, still dark. Glancing at the opposite side of the bed, I saw Aubrey asleep, her chest rising and falling. I took a deep sigh of relief.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAubrey\u2019s alive.\n\n\n\nFeeling dehydrated, I slipped out of bed and went to the kitchen to pour a glass of water. I made my way back to the bedroom, stepping gently not to wake Aubrey. As I entered the room, I felt the air had changed.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAs I looked toward Aubrey, my glass came crashing to the floor, shattering into dozens of pieces. There in the dark, was my girlfriend sitting upright, stiff. Her arms dropped to her sides. Her eyes rolled back again, her pupils disappearing behind her skull. Her mouth gaped open as she stared forward into the darkness.\n\n\n\n\u201cAubrey*, wake up!*\u201d\n\n\n\nI rushed to her side, my bare feet tearing on the shards of glass strewn across the floor. I grabbed Aubrey by the shoulders and shook her. Desperately pleading, tears streaming down my face.\n\n\n\n\u201cAubrey, *please, please* wake up!\u201d No response. I ran to the kitchen to grab a wet towel, trying carefully to avoid the glass on the floor this time; maybe a cold, damp cloth would wake her.\n\n\n\nAs I returned, she had fallen back into bed fast asleep.\n\n\n\n\u2022\u2022\n\n\n\nThe following morning, Aubrey looked strangely refreshed. There were no longer dark circles under her eyes, and her skin was radiant. She almost appeared\u2026 younger.\n\n\n\nLooking closer, I could see her eyes had somehow changed. Instead of rich brown, they were slate grey\u2014the same shade of grey I saw in the old woman\u2019s gaze at the chanting. A wave of distress washed over me as we made eye contact.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat happened last night? I remember drinking that awful tea, then everything just went dark.\u201d\n\n\n\nI explained the horrors, everything I saw, the black fluid\u2014all of it. Aubrey looked oddly dismissive, brushing off the nightmare I had just spent the last twenty minutes explaining to her.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere must have been something in the tea. We\u2019re at a wellness retreat after all. I feel fine, rested even! Come on, let's get ready. Forest bathing starts in an hour.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2022\u2022\n\n\n\nAgainst my better judgment and pleading, we arrived at a small clearing in the woods near the coast. Waves crashed against the cliffs, and a steady, cool breeze howled through the canopy above. The resinous scent of furs and pines filled the air. Even during the day, the forest was dark and damp here.\n\n\n\nTo our surprise, no one was around\u2014not a single guest, not even the staff\u2014just the howling of the wind and the waves threatening the cliffs in the distance.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhere the hell is everyone?\u201d I questioned anxiously. My instinct was screaming to turn around, leave, and never look back.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just head back. Something feels\u2026 off.\u201d\n\n\n\nAubrey wasn\u2019t feeling the same sentiment. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be here soon. We already came all this way, let\u2019s just wait ten more minutes.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t like Aubrey. She was typically even more cautious and risk-averse than I was. I shrugged it off, hoping the ten minutes would pass so we could *finally* get the hell out of here.\n\n\n\nThe sun had started to fade, casting tall shadows across the floor of the opening in the woods from the towering trees surrounding it. Suddenly, I heard a disturbance resonating deep within the endless dark forest.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI paused, tuning my ears to the thicket beyond. My heart started pounding.\n\n\n\nThe noises grew closer. Discarded leaves and broken branches crackled under heavy footsteps. I could also hear voices between the gusts of wind\u2014a chorus coming from all directions\u2014the sound of a dozen people chanting in unison.  \n\n\n*\u201cOm namah Shivaya!\u201d*  \n\n\n*No. No****.*** ***No.***\n\n\n\nA flood of overwhelming panic replaced my anxiety. The chanting grew louder. I couldn\u2019t hear myself think; they were closing in, encircling us.\n\n\n\n*\u201cRa ma da sssaaaaa!\u201d*\u00a0\n\n\n\nI could see the group exiting the woods and entering the clearing. The elder appeared. She looked different, more deformed than before. Her arms and fingers were irregularly long, and her skin grey. Her presence immediately felt darker, more threatening.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe witch\u2019s cold, grey eyes scanned the surroundings, sharp like daggers as she continued chanting and creeping directly toward us, picking up speed.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u201cAubrey, something is seriously wrong. We have to get the hell out of here*!*\u201d\n\n\n\nBut it was too late. She was already in the elder\u2019s grasp, under her spell. Motionless.\n\n\n\nMy heart was racing as a torrent of panic overcame me. My nerves hummed like lightning. I wanted to run to Aubrey. Tear her from the crone's grasp so we could escape. But I couldn\u2019t move either, trapped in my frozen body.\n\n\n\nAll I could do was watch in horror as the elder extended her twisted, bony fingers to Aubrey\u2019s face. With the tips of her long, jagged fingernails, she carved an incision from Aubrey\u2019s chin to the side of her nose, up through her forehead, and toward the back of her skull. Blood trickling down Aubrey\u2019s face.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOnce satisfied, the witch began to slide her fingers under Aubrey\u2019s flesh and began to peel back both sides, exposing her insides. Aubrey wasn\u2019t screaming. She didn\u2019t flinch as the old woman\u2019s lower jaw unhinged, displaying rows of jagged, serrated teeth.\n\n\n\nThe witch lifted her head toward the midnight sky and let out an ear-piercing shriek, then sank her teeth into Aubrey\u2019s insides. The air filled with the sound of bones cracking and crunching. Muscles, meat, and tendons shredding between her jagged teeth while I watched in horror as she consumed Aubrey\u2014the smell of metal circulating in the air.\n\n\n\nShe unzipped the rest of Aubrey\u2019s flesh using her serrated fingernails, tracing from the back of her head down to the bottom of her back. The witch reached deeper into the bag of flesh, thrashing and tearing out the remaining organic matter, chunks of meat, organs, and splintered bones, all discarded into a pile of slop beside her.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe clothes Aubrey had been wearing no longer clung to her body, fell to the ground, soaking into the pool of blood and guts on the floor as the elder pressed further into Aubrey.\n\n\n\nThe witch disrobed. Her blood-soaked grin widened as she began sliding Aubrey\u2019s soft tissue over her own and wrapping Aubrey\u2019s face around hers to a perfect fit. She let out a blood-curdling scream as the grotesque transformation was complete.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, the chanting stopped. The forest fell silent.

I can\u2019t remember how I made it back to the casita. My head was pounding. I walked to the bathroom to wash my face and collect myself.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMy heart dropped as I looked in the mirror. The hair on the back of my neck stood up straight like it was pumping electric current. In the reflection, I could see that my eyes were a piercing stone grey, and a cup of black tea was on the counter."},"195":{"title":"I'm trapped on the edge of an abyss.

I think she was too afraid that she\u2019d break down crying and scare me, though. The goal was to make things seem as normal as possible. To not let me see the grown ups flinch.\n\nDad though; he could always smile through the worst of times. No matter how dire the situation, he always found a way to keep it up. Just this soft, warm grin that could calm storms and set pounding hearts at ease. My dad smiled so much that I\u2019m almost certain some people thought it was a fa\u00e7ade; a presentation to give the impression that he was fine, and so was everything else. It wasn\u2019t though. Somehow, he just managed to wring enough good out of any situation to still find the strength.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t smiling that day he told me, though, and that scared me more than anything.\n\nHe may not have been smiling, but he wasn\u2019t frowning either. He was plain. A vacant, plain expression that almost stared through me as my tiny figure stood before him.\n\nFinally, unable to take the unease any longer, I softly muttered, \u201cDad?\u201d\n\nThat was enough to pull him back down to earth, and also bring that signature grin back to his face, if only for a moment.\n\nOnly for a moment\u2026\n\nHe opened his arms as he sat on the couch and nodded to me, \u201cCome here, Henny. Come sit on my lap.\u201d\n\nThe return of his usual demeanor emboldened me, and I crossed my arms with a bratty huff. I had just turned seven, and I was a big girl now. I didn\u2019t sit on my dad's lap anymore, and I made sure to tell him all of this.\n\nDad just chuckled and insisted, saying, \u201cThat may be, but you\u2019re still a little girl to *me.* You won\u2019t be forever, though, and someday I won\u2019t be able to hold you anymore.\u201d He leaned in close and scowled his eyes playfully, \u201cThen, you\u2019re going to regret not getting all the hugs you could have.\u201d\n\nMy seven-year-old brain weighed his words carefully, and ultimately decided that the idea of one day not getting my father's world famous snuggles was, in fact, more terrifying than not being a \u2018big girl\u2019.\n\nI hobbled over to him, to which he scooped me into his arms, setting me on his knee and holding me tightly from behind. His breathing was shaky and exhausted, and I could tell he was too, as he lulled back against the sofa.\n\nAfter a pause that lasted far too long, he shakily said, \u201cYour mama is sick, Henny.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t know what he meant by that. I was confused why he was bothering to tell me; mom got sick all the time\u2014we all did. Still, I had enough sense even then to gauge from his voice that it was much more serious than that.\n\nAll I could think to say was, \u201cIs she okay?\u201d\n\nDad kissed my head, and I could hear a slight rasp to his voice as he told me, \u201cWell, not quite. She\u2019s really sick this time. Not the kind of sick that you get when you have to stay home from school.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of sick is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s um\u2026 It\u2019s called cancer.\u201d\n\nYou know, it\u2019s funny. When you\u2019re a kid and you don\u2019t know the meaning of a word, they always sound so harmless. No weight or danger attached to them. To me, cancer was just a word that I sometimes heard adults use. It was always in hushed whispers, or followed by a slew of apologies and pity sounds, but I didn\u2019t know why. I remember I thought it sounded fun, like \u2018dancer\u2019.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I heard my dad say it in that aching voice, and in a context involving mom, that it fully hit me how bad it was.\n\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d I asked quietly, folding my chin into his forearms, as if they\u2019d protect me from this new, scary monster.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s a real bad sickness. A sickness that hurts people.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow does it hurt people?\u201d\n\nDad didn\u2019t answer at first, thinking of how to put it best, \u201cYou see your skin?\u201d he began, tapping my arm with a finger, \u201cThat, and all the stuff under it is made of tiny little living things called cells.\u201d\n\nThat concept blew my mind, and I turned to my dad in mortified disbelief, \u201cMy skin is alive?\u201d\n\nDad couldn\u2019t help but chuckle, \u201cSort of. Why don\u2019t you imagine your body as a big factory, and the cells are the little workers inside that keep you nice and healthy.\u201d\n\nI stared at my arm in wonder, but didn\u2019t interrupt.\n\nDad\u2019s tone turned back to a more solemn one, and he cleared his throat, \u201cThose cells get old though, and need to replace each other eventually, so they make more. Sometimes, a bad one sneaks in.\u201d\n\n\u201cCancer?\u201d I mumbled softly.\n\nDad nodded, \u201cCancer cells get confused. Instead of helping the body, they start to attack it. They make the factory start to shut down, and if too many of them get made, then well\u2026 it does.\u201d\n\nMy stomach felt sick at that, even though I don\u2019t think I understood the weight of it. That was evidenced by my next sentence, \u201cIs there medicine we can give her to make her better?\u201d\n\nDad took a deep breath, then lifted me up, spinning me around on his lap to face him. Looking me in the eyes, he did his best to not break, \u201cCancer is confusing, Henny. It\u2019s like those snakes you try to catch in the garden; slippery and hard to pin down. The doctors have different ways to try and find it to get it out, but it also hurts the person who has it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it would hurt mama?\u201d\n\nDad didn\u2019t respond, he just brushed a hand through my hair, \u201cMama\u2019s strong. She\u2019ll be okay. But it\u2019s going to take a long time for her to heal. She has a lot of those bad cells in her body.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did she get so many?\u201d\n\nI could feel dad shrug his arms, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Sometimes they just happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did she not feel them sooner?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we just didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d dad started before something hit him hard. His voice broke, and he pulled in a breath that was shaky, trying to hold back a sob, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nI had so many questions still. Kids are notorious for that. We could ask \u2018why\u2019 to everything until all the knowledge in the universe was imparted to us, then still find one more to toss in. But like I said, seeing my father upset scared me, so I shut up and sat still in his lap, silently looking at the ground in thought while he buried his neck into my hair and gently wet it with tears.\n\n\u201cHensley?\u201d Hope called over her shoulder, looking back at me and shining my phone light. We\u2019ve been together long enough now that I more than trusted her with it.\n\nI had spaced out and stopped moving during a walk to the vending machines. We\u2019d finally run out of food, and since we\u2019ve been a lot more physical lately moving bodies, we were burning through it much faster. We were heading there with an intent to finally smash it open and take everything inside, but I\u2019d got lost in thought the moment my eyes met with the glowing parking lot of the play place just down the road.\n\n*Zanes Jammin\u2019 Jungle.*\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Hope's smile faltered.\n\n\u201cYeah\u2014sorry, just\u2026\u201d\n\nHer eyes traced my own, then she frowned and nodded her head toward the motel, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s keep moving. We\u2019re about due for a creature soon.\u201d\n\nI nodded, then joined her side before continuing down the road.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d she said as we moved, her eyes also now focused on the sinister fragment of the past, \u201cWhy that place? I\u2019ve barely even thought about it since we were kids.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s another difference between us, I guess,\u201d I sighed under my breath.\n\n\u201cFond birthday?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cNo. But the day after sticks in my mind pretty well.\u201d\n\nHope shamefully looked at the sidewalk and didn\u2019t respond, clearly feeling dumb for not putting two and two together.\n\nI winced a little to myself, awkwardly fidgeting with my oversized coat sleeves. Since her arrival, Hope had been working double time to keep the spirits high for both of us, and I hadn\u2019t exactly been pulling my weight. If anything, I\u2019d been infecting her with my negativity.\n\nTrying to cheer her up, I bumped her shoulder with mine, \u201cYou\u2019re probably right, though. Mom would have wanted the birthday to be what stuck more.\u201d\n\nShe smiled only faintly, but her eyes at least drew back up. She spoke a few moments later, \u201cHey, Hen\u2026 what am I?\u201d\n\nThe question caught me off guard, but admittedly, it was to be expected, eventually. Since we\u2019d met, it\u2019d always been on our minds, there had just been far more important issues at hand that we needed to sort out first.\n\nNow, in the dead space of routines, we finally had our moment.\n\nYou\u2019d think with all that time to think, I\u2019d have come up with a better response than, \u201cOh, um, well, you\u2019re me, aren\u2019t you? I thought we already knew that.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I know, but\u2026 *what* am I?\u201d She snickered softly, \u201cLike, we look the same and talk the same and have all the same memories, but we clearly don\u2019t think the same. I should have made that connection too about Zane\u2019s, it was an important moment in my life just as much as yours. Is it\u2026 bad that it didn\u2019t even come to mind?\u201d\n\n\u201cHope, what?\u201d I said, feeling guilt in my stomach for spiraling her down this hole, \u201cNo; you\u2019re fine\u2014you\u2019re, um, great.\u201d\n\nShe gave me a look that told me she didn\u2019t believe my words.\n\n\u201cListen, that day after our party was obviously not a good one, and you\u2019re the much more optimistic of us two. Of course your mind wouldn\u2019t have gone to the dark place like mine did.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, but what does that make me, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I tossed my hands up with a chuckle, trying to find the right words to diffuse her concern, \u201cI mean, you came from me. Like, literally *came out* of my body. Maybe that means you\u2019re just another part of myself. This place clearly is making imprints of bits and pieces from people's lives, you\u2019re probably just a fragment of who we are.\u201d Realizing that didn\u2019t sound the most flattering, I turned to her and sincerely added, \u201cClearly all the best parts of me.\u201d\n\nThat was enough to make her smile, then shake her head, \u201cShut up. You\u2019re fine, Hen. If I came out of you, then that means everything I am is just as much you as me.\u201d\n\nI snickered, \u201cYeah. Sure. That\u2019s why I\u2019m *so* much fun to be around.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re *fine,*\u201d Hope reiterated before falling back to silence. It took her a beat to work up the courage for her next question, \u201cSo\u2026 what happens when we get out of here?\u201d\n\nI swallowed, then said, \u201cHuh, what do you mean?\u201d\n\nI knew exactly what she meant.\n\nShe clearly sensed my nerves, \u201cD-Don\u2019t worry; I\u2019m not, like, panicked about it or anything. There\u2019s a good chance when we leave I might just like\u2026 stop existing? I guess that\u2019s best-case scenario.\n\n\u201cHope, that\u2019s not best case\u2026\u201d I told her. \u201cYou\u2019re a person too, now.\u201d\n\nShe turned to me and made a joke that honestly surprised me coming from her, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Hen. We\u2019ve come to terms with dying a long time ago, right?\u201d\n\nI frowned, but couldn\u2019t find words to retaliate with before she spoke again.\n\n\u201cBut if that doesn\u2019t happen then, like\u2026 what then? You\u2019re just going to have another you walking around, and that might get complicated.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat. Just what the world needs: more of me,\u201d I joked half heartedly.\n\n\u00a0\u201cHensley\u2026 I\u2019m serious.\u201d Hope prodded, \u201cI won\u2019t have any legal identity; I couldn\u2019t just go off and make a life of my own very easily. And besides there's\u2014\u201d\n\nShe started to say something else, but quickly cut it off.\n\nI wasn\u2019t about to let it slide, \u201cWhat? There\u2019s what?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing. I guess we don\u2019t really need to get into it right now\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cHope,\u201d I continued digging.\n\nShe sighed and threw her head back, almost looking guilty for her next words. She hugged herself and spoke, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014I guess there\u2019s just everyone else? Like, I\u2019m you, Hen. I still love our family and friends and\u2026 and Trevor. It would just suck to leave him, but\u2026 we can\u2019t both be in the picture.\u201d\n\nI stared at her with my mouth parted slightly, a sick feeling heavy in my stomach. \u201cHope, let\u2019s\u2026 Not worry about that right now. We\u2019ll figure it out when we get out of here.\u201d I moved and hesitantly placed a hand on my clone's shoulder, \u201cThey\u2019re going to love you just as much as me. If we proved to them what happened and that you\u2019re really me, they would never turn you away.\u201d Trying to lighten things, I added, \u201cPlus, I don\u2019t think Trevor would mind having two of the woman he loves around.\u201d\n\nIt got a snicker from her, but she shook her head, \u201cEh, he\u2019s not like that. He\u2019d still want only you. You\u2019re right, though. I guess we should figure this out once we get out.\u201d\n\n\u201cN-No, we can talk about it if you want, I was just\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSeriously, it\u2019s okay, Hen!\u201d Hope smiled bright and far too convincingly, \u201cOne step at a time here.\u201d\n\nWe finally arrived at the machines right as our conversation finished, and though I was still worried about Hope, I didn\u2019t want to push things, so I turned back to the task at hand. I was a little confused when I did, however.\n\n\u201cAlright, you ready to break these suckers open?\u201d she questioned.\n\n\u201cHang on, that\u2019s not right\u2026\u201d I muttered.\n\n\u201cWhat? What\u2019s up?\u201d\n\n\u201cThese rows were empty last time I was here,\u201d I explained, pointing to a lane of chips, \u201cI cleaned it all out; bought their whole stock. Why are they back?\u201d\n\nHope furrowed her brow, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\n\u201cDead sure. The weird thing is, that one has a new kind of chips,\u201d I said, tapping on the glass.\n\n\u201cIs it\u2026 being restocked?\u201d\n\nI snorted, \u201cYeah, the regular maintenance man of the abyss is stopping by to make sure.\u201d\n\nHope shot me a glare, then elaborated, \u201cI *mean* maybe through some other means, dummy. The imprint map has these listed as a research site; maybe they\u2019re special somehow.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe *they*\u2019*re* imprints of some kind.\u201d I ventured.\n\n\u201cElaborate, please.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s the giant building from our childhood that showed up here,\u201d I started turning and pointing to it in the distance, \u201cSo obviously things from the past can show up here. Like an imprint.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Hope nodded.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about the bodies lately and how they\u2019re singing and talking. They sound like recordings of different life events. That first one we found said \u2018I love you\u2019 to somebody who said it back, then romantic music started playing, remember? Then there was that um\u2026 unsettling one where\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! Nope. We don\u2019t need to talk about that.\u201d Hope said pressing her hand to her ears.\n\nWe\u2019d found a corpse recently that wasn\u2019t spouting random phrases or songs like the others, although to call it a corpse might be an overstatement. When we arrived at its location in a small hardware store, it was merely a vile, sticky, rotting puddle on the floor, filled with bone and hair and bits of flesh. \u00a0The only identifiable things left were small digits like fingers and toes and a single ear floating in the gore.\n\nWe almost left it and just went to a different one, but the dots on the map were already getting thin the more we ticked them off one by one, and the hatch meter was still not even a quarter of the way full. We couldn\u2019t afford to pass any up, and besides, we already had a set method to sweeping the town, so we decided not to change things up now.\n\nWe grabbed some respirator masks from a shelf of the store (something we honestly should have done a long time ago) then some snowplow shovels before heading back to the body. Hope and I \u2018rock-paper-scissored\u2019 for who got one job, and I ended up losing, making me have to shovel the goo up while she held the trash bag open. It was all either of us had not to puke at the crackling noise of flesh peeling from the floor, but that quickly became the least disturbing thing.\n\nAs we disrupted the body, it began to wake up. They usually don\u2019t start making noise until Hope and I begin jostling them around, but this one did nearly instantly. It sounded foggy and warbled, as if the means by which it spoke was broken.\n\n\u201cNo\u2026 no, no, God please! Please!\u201d\n\nThere was the frantic sound of shoes pounding across the concrete floor, but then I heard an abrupt slamming noise, and the man let out a grunt. There was more sounds filling the space with him, something moving toward him.\n\nSomething that sounded like cracking bones and snapping branches as it moved. I could hear whispers filling the air along with them.\n\n\u00a0The man let out some more desperate pleas for help and cries for mercy in a voice so primal and filled with fear that my body locked up in horror.\n\n\u201cNo! No, no, no\u2014please! Please I\u2014\u201d\n\n*CRUNCH.*\n\nThe noise was sharp and sudden. One loud clap of something crushing the man in the flash of an instant. I could hear him gurgle and gasp in surprise, but it wasn\u2019t over.\n\n*CRUNCH, CLOMP.*\n\nIt sounded like two massive boards of wood being pounded together with the man inside. I could hear his bones and flesh being ground up and pummeled to paste as it happened, and all the while he tried to make more sounds. My head spun and felt nauseous as I thought I heard him attempt to call out for his mother, but it only came out in an incoherent gurgle that nobody would hear. Then, finally\u2014\n\n*CRUNCH.*\n\nAnd the memory was over.\n\nBut that\u2019s not how the bodies here work; they don\u2019t just stop then go silent. They ramble over and over and over again until we throw them down the chute. Normally, they have multiple memories and sounds that they cycle through, but whatever happened to that man, it had to have been so horrifying that it was only part of him that could stain into this place.\n\nIt was the only thing that played until we got the body to the hatch.\n\nThe worst part was that it didn\u2019t even fill the imprint gauge at all. All we got was a brand new fear.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the only case of that, however. The same exact thing happened when we went back to retrieve Juarez\u2019s legs. The same memory of something with stiff, cracking joints and menacing whispers that follows its wake. His wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as the puddle, only the sound of the tower skylight smashing then shaking breath. One clap of it cleaving his body in two, and then the memory was over.\n\nThat one hadn\u2019t stuck in Hope\u2019s head as much because Juarez at least seemed to have some other happier memories that balanced out the horror as we walked him to the hatch. Both cases certainly stuck in mine, however.\n\nYou may have already put two and two together, but that creature? The one that I heard in both those dead man tales? It was the same one I dreamed about. The same thing that I heard in my last post.\n\nOnce I realized that, I went back and reread the notes that we\u2019d found. I couldn\u2019t sleep that night and needed to make sure I wasn\u2019t just inflating things in my mind. Unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t.\n\nIn Brand's letter, they mentioned the creature that killed their team coming back up to the shelf with its \u2018Maddening whispers and clattering bones\u2019. It\u2019s a perfect match.\n\nI don\u2019t think Hope has put those two things together, and I don\u2019t have the heart to tell her that whatever killed those two people is what\u2019s coming back eventually to kill us. And whatever it is, it\u2019s so horrifying that Brand took an easier way out just to avoid it, and Juarez let it take him because he thought he deserved it more than hell.\n\nI\u2019m more terrified now than ever. We need to get out of this place.\n\nAnyway, all of this is to say that I\u2019d begun forming theories of the shelf based on the bodies.\n\n\u201cWhat if this place is like one big notebook or something?\u201d I asked her, \u201cLike, everything that has been here or passed through leaves a mark on it somehow.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad theory\u2026\u201d Hope answered, \u201cAnd maybe it\u2019s like, the harder you press, the more you leave behind? Like leaving grooves on the sheet behind the first one.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, exactly,\u201d I nodded, \u201cMaybe we\u2019ve been here so long that that\u2019s why Zane\u2019s popped up.\u201d\n\nHope placed a hand to her chin, \u201cMaybe. But if that\u2019s the case, then why does it seem like the scientists here didn\u2019t have any real effect on the area. They must have been here a while.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile, some equipment is broken. Maybe they had a way to control it or monitor it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I guess that makes sense.\u201d Hope nodded, turning back to the vending machine, \u201cBut back to the matter at hand, how does that involve the chips?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe the stuff that imprints here isn\u2019t just after it enters. This town exists in the real world; I know because I drove through it before I started getting pulled into this place. Maybe this is part of the town outside that\u2019s getting recorded in here too?\u201d\n\nHope smiled, \u201cMan, you\u2019ve really been working at this, huh?\u201d\n\nI scoffed and looked at my reflection in the snack machine glass, \u201cYeah, well, none of that is for certain. It\u2019s all just guesses based on what we have so far.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s good enough for now; it makes enough sense at least!\u201d Hope said, patting my back, \u201cSo where does that leave us with these, then? We probably shouldn\u2019t smash them, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWell, what if it breaks that imprint?\u201d Hope questioned, \u201cRight now, we have infinite food so long as we keep using it the way you did the first time. If we\u2019re here for much longer, we might need that. And besides, if we don\u2019t make it out of here, and somebody else gets stuck, then\u2026 Well, it would be nice to pay it forward, you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s awfully thoughtful of you,\u201d I told her with a sarcastic smirk.\n\n\u201cWell, we gotta look at this from all angles,\u201d she sighed darkly before starting for the motel office doors.\n\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo take out some cash,\u201d she called over her shoulder with an amused grin.\n\nHer idea was good; there was a decent stack of cash in the rundown register. We couldn\u2019t use a lot of the big bills on the machine, unfortunately, but there was enough 1\u2019s and 5\u2019s to get us stocked back up.\n\nAs I worked the bills and keypad on the machine, Hope kept watch on the tower, making sure that the light didn\u2019t click on. I even bought some drinks this time so that we wouldn\u2019t have to only keep drinking this places putrid water. We were nearing the end of our grocery shopping when something else caught our attention, however. We noticed it in the silence of me entering a new keypad combo.\n\nMusic filling the air; loud, but distant. We both looked over our shoulder toward the direction it was coming from.\n\nZane\u2019s Jammin\u2019 Jungle.\n\nThere was a jumpy, 60\u2019s style rock tune blaring through speakers within that leaked through its walls and into the town. For as unsettling as the silence here had been, it was almost more eerie to hear noise coming from somewhere we weren\u2019t occupying. We were the only ones here, after all.\n\nI looked to the tower light. Still off.\n\n\u201cThe power still works in there\u2026\u201d hope noted.\n\n\u201cMakes sense. The parking lot is on, too. The building looks like it\u2019s safe from this place's rot as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven so, who started the music?\u201d\n\nI thought for a moment, listening hard to the tune. It was familiar. Somewhat nostalgic. I\u2019d heard it before, long, long ago.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s that animatronic band,\u201d I said, \u201cThey would always play every hour on the hour. Maybe it\u2019s on a timer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Hope nodded, \u201cThat tracks.\u201d\n\nI finished grabbing out the chips that had dropped while we were gawking and handed them to Hope, \u201cReady to call it for today?\u201d\n\nShe crammed them into her pack, then slung it on, \u201cYeah. All this body upkeep is really taxing, mentally, and physically.\u201d\n\nA little bit after we got back to the station, the light to the tower finally clicked on. Just in time, I suppose. The beast came from the top of the cliffs this time, something we learned recently could happen. It seems that even above us isn\u2019t safe. We\u2019re truly surrounded down here.\n\nHope and I paid little mind to it as it began moving through town on its hunt, however. It was quiet, thankfully, and we\u2019ve gotten a lot more comfortable moving around the radio tower while beasts are in town. Whatever shield they put on this place, it stops things from even getting past the sidewalk to the building, so we figured we probably don\u2019t need to hunch under desks for hours on end anymore.\n\nWe still hide if things get too close, though. Can\u2019t be too careless.\n\nThe two of us went up to the main room to update our map. It\u2019s much more bearable to be up there now that the scent has had time to air out. I\u2019m still working out trying to fix machines in my free time, but not making much progress. This is high-tech lab equipment vs. a random girl from California, so, obviously you can tell how that match is going. I\u2019m not giving up, though. I\u2019m still seeing all of your comments listed on my posts, and I know that there\u2019s gotta be something valuable that I\u2019m missing by not seeing them.\n\nHope and I reached the imprint map then looked down at it with disappointed frowns. The dots were already wearing very thin, only a couple dozen left, and the meter by the machine by the door wasn\u2019t even close to being filled up. The problem was, Hope and I didn\u2019t even know what filling it would do, and even if we did get the door open and got to \u2018the drill\u2019, we didn\u2019t know how much energy we\u2019d need to power it. If it was a full tank, we were screwed, and considering that we were trying to punch a hole out of a hellish dimension, I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s the case.\n\nHope keeps trying to keep spirits high, though, \u201cThat\u2019s okay. Some of these might be worth more than others. That one in that yellow house was worth quite a bit.\u201d\n\nEven I couldn\u2019t entertain her this time, \u201cHope\u2026 we need more.\u201d\n\nShe bit her cheek and kept her eyes glued to the map, \u201cWell, once we get them all, we can pivot to trying to get the door open. We can probably get some more clarity inside.\u201d\n\nI sighed and leaned against the console to force myself in her view, \u201cListen, I know you\u2019re scared, but you\u2019re not dumb, Hope. There\u2019s nothing left out here; we would have found it by now.\u201d\n\nI pressed a finger to the rig 1 icon without looking.\n\n\u201cWe have to go into Zane\u2019s. It\u2019s clearly another place where these people were set up; there has to be clues in there. Maybe there\u2019s a password to the laptop or something\u2014that\u2019s gotta have all the information we need.\u201d\n\nHope put on a desperate face, \u201cI know, Hen, but we don\u2019t know what\u2019s in there. There\u2019s no protection like this tower. If we go in there and you die\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThen fine,\u201d I cut her off, a little frustration growing inside me, \u201cWe\u2019re probably going to die anyway, so I don\u2019t exactly see the harm in doing it early. We have to do something, though; I don\u2019t see why you\u2019re so concerned if I live or croak, considering that\u2019s a given, even if we get out of here.\u201d\n\nI fully expected her to raise her voice in return; it\u2019s certainly what I would have done. Hope really is the better half of me, though, \u201cI care if you die because you need to make it home. Dad and Trevor are waiting on you. That place is just too convenient\u2014too real. Like it\u2019s *trying* to lure you in. We can\u2019t trust this place.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t stop my anger from growing more, and my next words slipped out on pure impulse, \u201cOh really? Well, technically, *you* came from this place, so how do I know I can trust *you*? You seem like you\u2019re trying awfully hard to keep me from making any real progress.\u201d\n\nThe look of hurt on my own face made me internally wince, but it somehow hurt more that hope still didn\u2019t lash back. She just sadly muttered, \u201cI-I\u2019m not trying to\u2026 I just wanted to\u2026\u201d\n\nI wanted immediately to comfort her. To say that I was sorry and that I didn\u2019t mean that. I\u2019ve been told that I\u2019m stubborn at the worst of times, though, and my impulsive coldness always has a way of getting the better of me. I simply couldn\u2019t force anything out.\n\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right,\u201d Hope pitifully said, attempting to pull up a weak smile, \u201cLet\u2019s just\u2026 talk about this later? I\u2019m going to go lay down. I\u2019m tired.\u201d\n\nFinally, I broke from my binds but it was too late, \u201cHope, I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay! Really,\u201d she quickly reassured, moving backward for the door, clearly eager to escape, \u201cshouldn\u2019t be putting anything off the table. We need to take risks if we\u2019re going to make it out of here.\u201d\n\nI once again found I couldn\u2019t respond, which only led to a very awkward, painful silence as Hope lay her hand on the doorknob and waited for a response. When I didn\u2019t give one, she just nodded with a smile, then exited.\n\nImmediately, I let out a huff of frustration, then buried my hands into my face. Meanwhile, the beast on the shelf with us let out a strange, machine gun sounding cackle. Clearly, it found my suffering funny.\n\nIt took me a while before I left the tower room, then headed back downstairs, but I didn\u2019t reenter the offices. It\u2019s strange; when I first got here, I would have killed to have company, but now that I\u2019d spent every waking moment with Hope the last few weeks, I suddenly found the desire to be alone.\n\nIt was less rooted in selfishness than it was self-loathing, however. I needed to be alone to stew with myself.\n\nI hated that I was like that. So easy to snap and vicious when there was resistance before me. Hope had been nothing but kind and helpful since she arrived and even solved several things about this place already. She didn\u2019t need to be put on blast by the pitiful little bitch who only whines and complains. I really was the queen of that. Always have been. And then what did I do after I\u2019d lash out and make people feel like shit?\n\nGo sulk and stew like I was doing right now.\n\nA consuming cycle. A horrible beast worse than the ones outside that I let devour me more and more each time I did it. Maybe it had already eaten me whole. After all, that was why I was here. One long, two week self-pity party on the road, pushing everyone I cared and loved away because I couldn\u2019t handle the way *I\u2019d* acted back home.\n\nI missed Trevor. I missed dad. I missed my other friends, even though I hadn\u2019t reached out in months. Why couldn\u2019t I just be Hope? Where was she all that time she was inside of me? The kind, sweet version of me that never angered or got upset?\n\nMaybe she was right about Zane\u2019s. I have a tendency to be reckless; was this just another excuse for me to barrel into something blind again?\n\nThe more I thought about it, the more I knew it couldn\u2019t be, though. If I was at least right about one thing, it had to be that. She had a point about it being too perfect, but that was the exact reason we had to go in there. This place wanted me to. It was like it wasn\u2019t going to let us progress unless I played by its rules.\n\nFrom a more literal standpoint, it also made logical sense. The rigs were clearly designed to harvest something; probably for the drill. If there were clues on how it worked and how to operate the machine, they were in there.\n\nMy brain continued running logistics until it eventually fell back to the emotional. Hope had raised a great question; why Zane\u2019s? The day was great for me as a kid, but it wasn\u2019t anything special. I hardly remembered any details about it at all. If anything, shouldn\u2019t something have appeared that mirrored the following day like I\u2019d said? The much more impactful one.\n\nAs I dwelled on it, I couldn\u2019t help but fall back into the memory. Sitting there with Dad. We\u2019d sat there for a long time after he stopped talking. He held me, and I just awkwardly sat there like kids do, hugging him back but not quite understanding his emotions. I knew he was sad, but I didn\u2019t realize then he was crushed.\n\nNo, my mind had been elsewhere. In the young, na\u00efve questions about such affairs. This cancer thing, was it going to make Mom throw up a bunch like I did when I got sick? Dad said that if enough bad cells got in, the factory \u2018shut down\u2019, but how does a body just \u2018stop working\u2019? That didn\u2019t make any sense to me. As far as I knew from movies, you had to get hit really hard or stabbed for you body to die.\n\nI remember one question in specific that felt important enough to ask, \u201cDad, can you get cancer too?\u201d my voice barely above a mumble.\n\n\u201cHm?\u201d he asked, lifting his head from my hair.\n\n\u201cCan mama give you cancer too?\u201d\n\nDad smiled and squeezed me tight, \u201cNo, don\u2019t worry, Henny. Cancer isn\u2019t a sickness like that.\u00a0 It\u2019s not contagious. We\u2019ll be just fine, you and me.\u201d\n\nI remember the way he said that so vividly. Filled with so much warmth and reassurance. I had been feeling sick and uneasy that whole time, since the moment he told me Mom was sick, but in that one instant, if only for a moment, he chased it all away. He had a way of doing that a lot throughout Mom\u2019s decline. Easing the waters when they got too stormy.\n\nAs I grew up, I began to realize that his words weren\u2019t concrete. Just because he said it in a way that calmed me down didn\u2019t mean he was going to be right. I never held it against him, though, when things didn\u2019t pan out well. Eventually, I just learned to appreciate that he was keeping his head up through the pain, and trying to do the same for me.\n\nIf Hope really is part of me, she\u2019s gotta be everything that Dad taught me.\n\nMy phone was in my hand without me even realizing, contacts open and hovering over the first voicemail from my dad. Just like with Trevor, I was terrified to hear it, but I just needed his voice.\n\nTears were already falling before I tapped play.\n\n\u201cHey, Henny,\u201d he said, a smile hidden in his tone. His voice was old and worn now, not like that day when I was 7 years old. Still, he talked with just as much warmth. \u201cI, um, hear you\u2019re out on the road. I hope you\u2019re being safe.\u201d\n\nThere was a long pause filled by the crackle of the phone's mic, my dad\u2019s breathing and the silence between them.\n\n\u201cTrevor, um, told me, Henny. About the diagnosis. P-Please don\u2019t be mad at him; he was just worried about you since you\u2019ve\u2026 well, you\u2019ve been gone.\u201d\n\nI could hear his smile give way to tears, his voice a hoarse crackle.\n\n\u201cListen, sweetie, you can talk to me always, okay? *Always*. I know you\u2019re probably scared and confused and going through a lot right now. I know why you\u2019d probably want to be out on that road alone, but\u2026 you aren\u2019t going to find anything out there, Hen. I promise. Only a lot of loneliness and just more questions about yourself that you can\u2019t answer.\u201d\n\nI shut my eyes tightly and gritted my teeth. Why hadn\u2019t I just checked my phone. Just one time on that damn trip?\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come on home, okay?\u201d Dad asked, smile back behind his words, \u201cCome home, and we\u2019ll work through this together. I love you, my little Hen.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you too, Dad\u2026\u201d I whispered softly.\n\nThen voicemail ended.\n\nI let my phone fall to my lap, curling into myself as I let more soft sobs slip out of me. My joints ached in that position, and the muscles through my body burned and stabbed. I felt tired and fatigued.\n\nMy dad had a lot to explain that day he told me about cancer. It\u2019s such an awful, complicated thing that it\u2019d be impossible to cover it all in one sitting, especially to a little girl. He didn\u2019t have time to explain chemotherapy in depth. He didn\u2019t have time to warn me about all the awful things it does to a person and their body all in an attempt to uproot the thing slowly infecting your insides. He didn\u2019t have time to tell me about the different types of cancer that can appear in all the different places. The brain, the lungs, the skin.\n\nIn the bones.\n\nHe didn\u2019t tell me about the way it can spread to different parts of the body, and that there were stages to it. That if you didn\u2019t catch it soon enough, and if it had already spread too far, it might already be too late to stop it.\n\nAnd the one thing that my dad didn\u2019t explain to me when he told me that cancer wasn\u2019t contagious was that there was a thing called heredities. He didn\u2019t tell me that cancers, although rare, have a chance of passing down from parent to child.\n\nLike I said, though, I didn\u2019t hold it against him when things didn\u2019t pan out.\n\nI nearly jumped out of my skin when I felt the couch sink next to me, and a pair of arms wrap my shoulders.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Hope muttered, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to scare you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I chuckled, wiping my eyes, \u201chow long have you been here?\u201d\n\n\u201cLong enough,\u201d she told me.\n\nI nodded, then caught my breath before speaking again, \u201cI trust you, Hope. I didn\u2019t mean that earlier.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d She smiled, \u201cI\u2019m you, remember? I know how we can be sometimes.\u201d\n\nI snickered, then sat up, to which Hope leaned over fully, resting on my shoulder, \u201cYou were right, though. We need to go in there.\u201d\n\nI nodded, but it was weak, \u201cYou were right too. It\u2019s probably going to be dangerous. Maybe a trap.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, whatever it is, we\u2019ll make it through.\u201d Hope told me, her eyes looking down at my phone, \u201cWe have to for them.\u201d\n\nI nodded, then we both fell to silence, just taking a moment to rest before the impending storm.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve figured out the answer to your question earlier. The one about why Zane\u2019s is so important.\u201d I eventually spoke.\n\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d she asked softly.\n\n\u201cI think that was the last day of my life that I remember being happy.\u201d\n\nHope didn\u2019t say anything in response. She didn\u2019t agree or deny the words. She just hugged me tighter as my tears started up again, and we both sat there together through the night.\n\nThis is probably going to be my last update before we go into Zane\u2019s. If I don\u2019t post again soon, then\u2026 well, you can probably assume the worst. Don\u2019t worry, though; I don\u2019t intend on that being the case. Even if it does go down that way\u2014if I don\u2019t end up making it back out of that building from my youth\u2014don\u2019t mourn for me, okay? It was probably inevitable.\n\nAnd besides, at least I\u2019ll be going down with a friend. That\u2019s more than others who died here can say.\n\n\u00a0[Next Update](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kk9z1v\/im_trapped_on_the_edge_of_an_abyss_the_buildings\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)"},"196":{"title":"Maybe therapy isn't for everybody","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1ket6vm\/maybe_therapy_isnt_for_everybody\/","flair":"Self Harm","author":"bloodoftheforest","selftext":"\"It's just that sometimes I feel... not great. Sad, I guess. Yeah, sometimes I feel sad.\"\n\nI focused intently on my own hands, completely unable to look at Dr Melanie. My nails seemed too long. When did I last cut them? I needed to remember to trim them when I got home tonight. Wait, did I actually have nail scissors or had Alex taken them wh-\n\n\"You mourn,\" Dr Melanie replied though that certainly wasn't the way I'd phrased things, \"that's understandable. What do you do when you feel that way? Do you have coping mechanisms such as talking to others or are you less happy with your response to these feelings?\"\n\nI laughed quietly and without humour before stopping myself. I didn't want to treat Dr Melanie disrespectfully. Melanie wasn't even her real name, her real name had another couple of letters in it. But I'd misheard her the first time and instead of being annoyed with me for getting it so wrong she'd simply clarified her actual name, an unfamiliar word with a p in it somewhere, and said that calling her Melanie was completely fine. She'd been so patient with the glacial pace I'd taken to even this surface layer of 'opening up.' All in all, she seemed nice, professional and understanding.\n\n\"I... no. I don't talk to people. I can't. I want to open up to friends but it seems like either they aren't ones to talk about their feelings or they are but their problems are so much bigger than mine, you know? I have a friend who lost his kid. I can't... So, anyway, I thought maybe I could talk to strangers online but that seems difficult. Not technologically, I can work a computer. It's just awkward. You're the first person I've really talked to.\"\n\nMy eyes flicked up to Dr Melanie, searching her for some sort of emotional response. I think I was looking for judgement. I'd told myself that I was finding myself a therapy session in order to work out how to feel better but I think that was a lie. It was a lie I'd believed, or least sort of believed, but part of me had wanted to see a therapist so that they could assess me, so they could tell me that I was making a big deal out of nothing and it would be objective, professional fact. Instead she was just watching me, patiently waiting for me to go on.\n\n\"Oh, the coping mechanism thing. Not really. Kind of. I have one but it isn't good. It isn't bad, it's just... weird.\"\n\n\"Go on.\" Dr Melanie encouraged.\n\n\"I don't live nearby, I live outside of town. And there are some woods nearby and if I walk into them I can keep walking until the closest person is maybe a mile away. Nobody can hear me out there. So I just... scream.\"\n\nWith that I was back to not looking being able to look Dr Melanie in the eye, my gaze burning away at the clock on the wall instead.\n\n\"Does it help?\"\n\nI was so ready to be ridiculed that it took me a second or two to process the question.\n\n\"Oh. Not really. It seems like it should beforehand but then I do it and it seems like it just isn't *enough*. It seems like I need to be able to scream louder or longer than I can or need a whole choir to scream with me or something. It doesn't make sense but it seems like it could help if only I was *more.*\"\n\n\"You only have one mouth to scream with. More mouths would help.\"\n\nI laughed again, but it felt a little less constrained than it had earlier.\n\n\"Yeah, more mouths would help.\"\n\n  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\n\nBy the time I exited my session I felt a little better but this improvement vanished almost as soon as I entered the waiting room. There was a woman there, pale and shaking with patches of wetness all over her long sleeved top. The woman could not stop crying. She was quiet but her eyes were constantly leaking tears that she dabbed away at with the cuffs of her sleeves.\n\n*See,* I thought to myself, *she has real problems. Not like you.*\n\nI realised that I'd been staring and hurried away out of the door. The drive home was miserable, a familiar pressure building inside me. Once I got home I only went inside for a moment before heading out to the woods. I walked so quickly it was almost a run in parts and listened for a second once I reached my destination. So far nobody had ever been out walking in the area when I'd decided to have a screaming session but every time I was struck with a slight feeling of paranoia.\n\nThe next thing I did was crazy, I know that. I'm not a crazy person it just felt right. It felt like it was going to work.\n\nI took the pocket knife out from my jacket and unfolded the blade. I wasn't going to use it to hurt myself, not like that. I just thought that if I used it then it would make me better at screaming. I looked myself over for a suitable location and settled on my left forearm close to the elbow. Not the wrist, that's for self harm and suicides and it wasn't like that. I truly believed that what I was doing was different. I gritted my teeth and let the blade dig itself in.\n\nWhen I pulled the knife away the result was confusing, to say the least. There was a lot less blood than I would've expected. I hadn't stopped at a shallow depth so I should have expected there to be a lot of blood but instead, I'd had papercuts that bled more.\n\nThe weirder thing though, was that I could see something white there. My initial thought was that I'd somehow cut deeply enough to reach a bone but then I saw the gaps and realised I was wrong. Well, partially wrong. Teeth are bones, right?\n\nThe wound gaped and then ungaped. *It's a mouth,* I realised, *but it's not quite...*\n\nI ran my finger over the four visible teeth.\n\n*It's not done.*\n\nI let my knife widen the corners of this new mouth, stopping when I reached flesh. It's a ludicrous sentence because *the whole fucking thing* should have been flesh but there you have it. There was a point both ways where the blade would suddenly feel more resistance and pain would shoot from the area as if I was actually being cut and I knew that meant that the mouth was finished.\n\nI just stared at it at first. There were no lips but the teeth looked normal and when it opened slightly I was sure I saw a tongue in there. But I didn't do all of this just to stare at the mouth, I realised. I took a deep breath that I felt in my arm as well as my throat and then I went for it.\n\nOnce the screaming had concluded I was shocked how much *better* it felt. Not how much better *I* felt, but the screaming itself felt so much closer to making me feel better today than it had any time previously. I walked back with my hand over my new mouth, worried that somebody would notice it if they somehow passed by. I would need a long sleeved shirt next time, I reasoned. Or perhaps I should pick a different part of myself to open.\n\n  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n  \nThe world was a little blurry for a while, as I followed my strange new form of self improvement. I don't think I'm ever going to remember what happened in that period aside from those moments that happened within the woods. I know, from the evidence I've collected since then, that I continued to work from home. I also know that this work was below my usual level, though thankfully not bad enough that it got me fired. There's something else I know about that time too, something I almost never realised at all.\n\nIt was a stupid game that first made me suspicious of Dr Melanie. It had had some big update that I didn't have room for on my phone so I went through to see what could be deleted. That's when I found the recordings. I'd always intended to record my sessions with Dr Melanie so I could play them back and write down any advice from them at a future date. It wasn't alarming to see one recording labelled 'Therapy' but what shocked me was that there were *eight* of them.\n\n\"That can't be right...\" I muttered to myself, but the more I thought about it the more sense it made.\n\nSome of the details of the sessions didn't make sense if there'd been only one. I thought I remembered looking at a clock during my 'only' session but I can also clearly recall entering that same room on my first session and being surprised that the only objects in the room were two chairs -- no clock, no desk, no tissues that I'm sure were there later...\n\nThe waiting room had had different people in too. I'd never seen more than one person waiting there but if that was true then how could I so clearly remember different figures? Hell, the more I thought about it the more I remember wondering why they had a waiting room that large when aside from the receptionist I'd only ever seen one person or nobody waiting whenever I'd left.\n\nI opened one of the recordings at random, only avoiding the first one.\n\n*\"Do you mourn?\" Dr Melanie's voice asked.*\n\n*\"I mourn.\" I'd apparently replied.*\n\n*\"When you scream, is it enough?\"*\n\n*\"No.\"*\n\n*\"It will be soon. You need more mouths.\"*\n\nThat was the complete recording. It seemed like some of the earlier ones were longer but the more recent ones were all under a minute. What the hell? Also, did her comment mean that she knew about the mouths? Was she the one doing this somehow? Her voice had sounded wrong. It was the same voice I remembered but there was too much of it, almost as if there were multiple Dr Melanie's speaking at once.\n\nA helpful alert on my phone informed me that I should leave for therapy in ten minutes, an alert that I had presumably set myself. A quick glance showed that I had also set myself alerts and reminders for the eight previous sessions. Perhaps the most concerning thing was that today's session was labelled 'Last therapy session.'\n\n\"Oh, fuck that.\" I told myself.\n\nWho the hell would go to see Dr Melanie, knowing what I knew?\n\nUnfortunately, wondering who'd be stupid enough to see her was the very thought that made me realise I had to go. I hadn't been the only person seeing Dr Melanie. She might not have many patients but I'd definitely seen others waiting for my session to be over so that they could go and talk about their own problems. Was she doing the same thing to them? If she was, would they be any more likely to remember it than I had been?\n\nMy new mouths didn't like to be covered but I switched my shorts and T-shirt for the most loose fitting items I could find that would hide them all. A glance at my watch told me that the time I had spent changing clothes and convincing myself to leave meant I was now running late for my session but it wasn't as if I was actually heading there to receive therapy. I had to protect Dr Melanie's other patients from whatever it was she'd been doing to us. I drove as fast as I could to her office.\n\n\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\n\nIt was only when I left the car that I made another grim realisation about Dr Melanie's practice: she'd chosen somewhere so out of the way that it would be difficult to get any kind of help out to us quickly if I needed it. Dr Melanie hadn't chosen somewhere as isolated as my woods to set up office but a lot of the buildings nearby had closed their businesses long ago. When I'd first come out here I'd assumed the rent must just have been cheap but I was beginning to suspect the choice of location may have been driven by more sinister motives.\n\nI wasn't even that close by when I began to hear it. It was just an orchestra of agony. There were screams but they didn't have the short panicked bursts of somebody in immediate danger and the closer I got the more I could hear other noises. There was sobbing, wailing, muttering. I don't know what point I'd broken into a sprint but I reached the doors almost breathless. I threw them open and there Dr Melanie was, surrounded by her other patients.\n\nThere were so many people. I don't actually know how many patients a therapist would usually see but the waiting room that had always seemed so large and empty was now as crowded as a concert. Every patient that I could see was like me. They didn't all have multiple mouths but all of them had changed in some way. At one point during my struggle to push forwards towards Dr Melanie I saw the crying woman I'd noticed after my first session. Now that she was wearing a sleeveless dress I realised why her top had been so wet when I'd first seen her that day -- her arms were covered in steadily crying eyes. Even through the chaos of the other noises I could hear the gentle noise as each tear hit the floor. I turned away from her and pushed ahead.\n\n  \nDr Melanie was stood on the desk of the receptionist, a woman who was currently slumped silently forwards, her long hair a carpet beneath the therapist's feet.\n\n\"You came to me.\" Dr Melanie said.\n\nHer voice was so soft that I shouldn't have been able to hear it but, like the sounds of the tears from before, it was perfectly clear. I could isolate every sound in the room, in fact. Outside it had been chaotic but now I was in the middle of it all every note of pain and sadness from the other patients was together but seperate in an overwhelming melody.\n\n\"Do you mourn?\" she asked.\n\n*What did you do to me?* I tried to yell.\n\n\"I mourn.\" came my actual response.\n\n\"I think you have enough mouths now.\"\n\n*What are you?* I tried to ask.\n\nBut it was pointless. The pressure inside me had risen to an unbearable level with every step I'd taken and I could feel my new mouths open beneath the fabric of my clothes. I shook my head but I already knew there was nothing else to be done. I breathed in deeply like some sort of flute, air entering my body in impossible ways.\n\nThen I screamed.\n\nWhen I was younger I used to paint. I wasn't even particularly good but I used to adore that moment where I would add one final detail and be able to see that the work in front of me was now complete. The sound of my screaming was like that. I was the final instrument in her orchestra, my notes the only thing the melody that pressed around me could possibly have been missing.\n\nI thought she'd kill me, now it was complete. That would have made both more and less sense than what actually happened, I suppose. Dr Melanie forced her fingertips into the fabric of her loose dress part way down her abdomen, just below her high belt. When her fingers were in as deeply as they could go she pulled them out to the sides and tore not just the fabric but herself. There was no skin below that dress, no blood when she ripped herself open. All I can remember seeing is a dim glow that got brighter and brighter as the sound was sucked from the room.\n\nIt felt like it was the silence that knocked me to the floor but really I suppose it was the effort from all of the screaming. Or maybe it was shock, I don't know. When I sat up I realised I was hardly in the minority and that more of us were lying or sitting than standing.\n\n\"Did...  you see where...  she went?\" I croaked painfully at the man to my right.\n\nHe shook his head 'no' and I pulled myself more upright, then used the desk to help myself stand. There was a man stood behind the desk holding the receptionist's head in his hands. Like me, he had been covered with mouths moments ago. Now the only thing unusual about his appearance was the blood on his arms and it didn't seem like much of that was his.\n\n\"Alive?\" I asked, my widened eyes on the receptionist's empty ones.\n\nI didn't receive an answer but there was no real need for a reply. Now her head had been lifted I could see the slit across the receptionist's neck just as clearly as the man whose hand currently supported the woman's chin. He pulled away sharpy and her head slammed back to the desk with a clunk. From the other side of the room I heard the door open as someone left. It felt wrong but I couldn't blame them. Some hushed conversations took place and more left. I couldn't take my eyes off the dead woman.\n\nSomebody tapped my shoulder and I turned to see the woman with the eyes. She only had a normal amount of eyes now though. Both her and the man by the desk had small cuts where their more unusual features had more recently been.\n\n\"You need to leave,\" the woman said, \"both of you.\"\n\nI didn't move.\n\n\"She's dead and none of us can explain this. Once everyone's gone I'll delete all of your contact details from the laptop and call somebody. I'll say I just came to my appointment and found her like this. They might not believe me but it's the best we've got s- hmm. Fuck. She is not logged in. Well, given that I am not a hacker and the police will definitely be able to get inside that one of you should just take it with you. Probably for the best anyway, a computer at a reception with no client details would look suspicious. No laptop could mean the killer stole it or something. Wait.\"\n\nHer eyes scanned the room for something and then she ran to grab a blue cardigan that somebody had left on one of the chairs.\n\n\"You,\" she said at the man behind the desk, \"use this to get the worst of the blood off you. It won't get it all off so don't touch anything until you're clean or far away. It will have both of your DNA on it so do something smart with it when you get home. Do not burn it unless you usually have regular fires, you're going to want your behaviour to be super normal for the next few days. Normal routine, normal internet history, normal purchases in shops. Thoroughly bleach anything you get her blood on but again, try and make everything look normal. All of this cleaning either needs to be somewhere you know nobody else can see you or be done in such a way that it looks normal. Do you understand all of that?\"\n\nThe man nodded.\n\n\"Great. If you drove, leave now. If you didn't then I'll see if any of the other stragglers drove here because I think that jumper has wiped away all of the blood we can reasonably expect but you still have some on you and so public transport would be ill advised.\"\n\nHe left and the woman turned to me.\n\n\"Okay, so if you could just grab the laptop whilst touching everything as little as possible then that would be great. It would be great if it was wiped but since that's out of the question, do not send it to somebody else to be wiped. We wa-\"\n\n\"I... Can...\" I said, my throat protesting at the words.\n\n\"You can wipe it? That would be great. Probably not a good idea to sell it afterwards though. Wait, if you can wipe it then can you access it? Do not under any circumstance contact the other patients.\"\n\n\"But!\" I protested and my voice finally gave out completely.\n\nI pointed at the door to Dr Melanie's office and then to the exit. It took the woman a moment to understand what I meant but then she sighed.\n\n\"We aren't going to find her. Finding a human can be difficult but is possible for trained professionals with resources who don't need to lay low. That thing wasn't human. We know that, right?\"\n\nShe was right. I pointed at her and gave my best questioning look.\n\n\"I don't know what specifically you're asking,\" she responded, \"but I'll do my best. I'm telling you what to do because I think the things I've said are our best chance of most of us getting off unscathed. I'm staying here because somebody has to. I don't know what will happen to me but I'm hopeful that they won't believe I did anything either.\"\n\nI couldn't tell if she was lying on this last point. Even if she was, there was nothing I could do about it. If I stayed here too then there would just be two of us arrested. I carefully unplugged the laptop and took it home.\n\n  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\n\nI considered contacting the other patients, despite what I'd been told. In the end though, I decided that the many-eyed woman had been right. Even if somebody in the room that day had seen what direction Dr Melanie had headed when she'd left, that wouldn't be enough to go on. I wiped it and kept hold of it, just as I'd been told to.\n\nAt first I thought somebody would come for me but that never happened. For a few months I was focussed on making sure that my life looked normal so that whoever investigated me would have nothing suspicious to find. I didn't miss any work and I met up with my friends when they asked to hang out so that I would look normal. Eventually I accepted that I wasn't a suspect. Cautious research doesn't confirm whether anybody was charged in relation to the receptionist's death but it doesn't seem anybody thinks I'm connected.\n\nI tried to look Dr Melanie up but I couldn't figure much out. The website I'd initially used to request a therapy session, a website that never claimed to be connected to her personally but to connect people in our area with therapists, disappeared when she did. Searching the address of the office doesn't show any businesses being there in recent years, therapists or otherwise. I tried listening to the recordings on my phone to get a better idea of how to spell her surname but they're all wrong now. Every one of them only has my words, with spaces where I know for a fact she was replying to me.\n\nIt took months for the shock of it all to wear off and once it did I had a different problem. That old familiar pressure built up inside me again but now the thought of screaming disgusted me and terrified me. I couldn't go out and yell in the woods after the things that yelling had put me through. So, I tried something new. I poured myself a drink, a little whiskey for what's to come. I searched online for a community who might believe what I'd gone through, no matter how strange, and I found one. This community, in fact. I took a longer sip of my drink and stretched my wrists.\n\nThen I began [to type.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Leavesandink\/)"},"199":{"title":"I've seen the same woman kill herself three times, how do I get her to stop?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1kemvsw\/ive_seen_the_same_woman_kill_herself_three_times\/","flair":"Self Harm","author":"MrsSpaceCPT","selftext":"Hello Reddit!\n\nNot sure if this is the right sub to be asking about paranormal stuff.I think it's paranormal anyway. But if anyones an expert on ghosts, demons or even something dumb like creepy pastas, please feel free to take a swing at my problem.\n\nNow about that problem, it\u2019s as simple as it sounds.\n\nAbout four months ago, I was walking home from college to my bus station. Listening to Lady Gaga and drinking a Pepsi max. I was tired -\u00a0 having to deal with my bum of a professor for the last 4 days in a row so I was looking forward to the mildly comfy chairs of the old bus.\n\nI got to the station and waited for a long ass time before the bus finally arrived. I sat down at the very back on the left side and almost immediately drifted to sleep, Gaga being my only line of defence from complete slumber.\u00a0\n\nI then saw her, she was this sad, ragged looking girl. With baggy eyes and a saggy face she just stared off into nothing. To be completely honest she was pretty similar looking to me, it was like looking at a version of me that had died and come back to life. She even had my same beautiful curly hair. She was sweating, I could see the large and thick droplets of sweat running down her face, clinging to the edge of her chin and her nose. Her hands were buried in her pockets of her hoodie and shivered relentlessly.\u00a0\n\nI was admittedly very uncomfortable at the sight, who wouldn\u2019t be? So I made an admittedly idiotic mistake.\u00a0\n\nI spoke to her.\n\n\n\n\u201cAre you ok?\u201d I said removing my head phones and leaning in a little closer. Her spacy gaze quickly shifted to an intent stace at me, the quick snapping of her neck to face me made me jump back a little bit. Her face was angry, more angry than I thought was possible. It was like every level of hell was condensed into a single person and it was being directed to me. I pushed back against the bus window, as if I was trying to somehow move through the glass like a ghost.\n\nAnd then in one swift motion, she pulled out a short silver revolver, jammed it in her mouth and pulled the trigger.\n\nThe thick cloud of red mist erupted from her skull, her eyes quickly lost all soul that was behind them as her corpse fell to the side, brain matter, bone, skin, it was all leaking together into mush.\n\nThe police got involved, I had to double up on therapy and the general public just wrote what happened off as \u201cjust a random crazy who killed herself.\u201d\n\nI honestly don\u2019t remember much from the rest of the day, I was trying everything I could to just rationalise what I saw. Took me about one and a half months before I felt likeI could function again.\n\nBut, like a horrid twist of fate, that wasn\u2019t the last time I saw her.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAfter 2 months of the first suicide , it was like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. It was the same Gaga song, the same drink and the same day. As I got on the bus that day I felt another impossible sense of dread. I was scared she\u2019d come back. And she did, she got onto the bus and sat in her same seat. But instead of talking to her, she spoke to me this time.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy, why is this my fault?\u201d She said, looking as if she was staring over my shoulder, staring at nothing.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked her.\n\n\u201cWhy do you hate me?\u201d She continued.\n\nJust as I was about to get another word in, she pulled out the revolver. I think you know the rest.\n\n\n\nI didn\u2019t take the bus the next time. I instead chose to walk 3 whole hours just to get home. It was better than risking seeing her again. But I was stupid to think the bus was the problem. It was like she was waiting for me this time. I rounded a corner to an empty street and she was standing before me, presenting herself with the gun already in her mouth. And again I think you know the rest.\n\nThe police were interested and very suspicious about me. I mean I don\u2019t blame them, 3 girls who look the same all killing themselves in front of me in the span of 3 months. But, that quickly died down as I had literally no connection with her besides looking similar. The girl herself had nothing about her, no name, no family, it was like she was never real to begin with.\n\n\n\nSo Reddit. How do I make this stop? I know it won\u2019t be the last I see of her unless I do something about it. Any kinds of things I can do to dispel curses or evil spirits? Literally anything would help.

No sex.* \n\nIt sounded too good to be true, but, as a broke university student, I was willing to take my chances. I swiped right, and Tinder let me know it was a match. His message came seconds later. \n\n**Hey, there sweetheart :)**\n\nI cringed at that word, I hated it, but seven hundred dollars was seven hundred dollars, so I sucked it up and replied. \n\n**Hey ;)** \n\nHis name was Jack, and he told me he owned his own business, although he never specified what kind of business it was. We talked for a while before he asked me for my Venmo to send me the first payment. \n\nAfter a few minutes, I got the notification. I stared at the $700 for at least twenty minutes, expecting to wake up from a dream at any second. But it wasn\u2019t a dream. \n\n**You still there?** \n\nI clicked on the message. \n\n**Yeah.

Seven-hundred dollars to pick up a package? Come on, even I wasn\u2019t that naive. \n\n**From the post office or something?** \n\n**No.  I\u2019ll send you the address, but I\u2019d rather not do this through Tinder. You got Kik? Or you can give me your number.**\n\nKik? What was this, 2011? I decided to give him my number instead, and he texted me the address immediately, followed by the address to his house, where I would have to drop off the package. \n\n**I\u2019m not home right now, but there\u2019s a key on the bottom of the blue flower pot near the door. Go inside and put the package on the coffee table in the living room. Make sure that you lock the door when you go inside the house, and then lock it again when you leave.** \n\nI grabbed my car keys and wallet and got into my car, putting the address into Google maps. \n\n**Got it! Omw.** \n\nMy phone buzzed as I backed out of my driveway. \n\n**I\u2019m serious. Lock the door BOTH times. Please.** \n\nI thought that was a little excessive, but I promised him that I would. \n\nThe house looked abandoned. It had a broken chain link fence around it, with a small door that was hanging onto dear life. It stuck out like a sore thumb, surrounded by houses that were a lot nicer than this one in comparison. \n\n\u201cYou here for Jack\u2019s shit?\u201d\n\nI looked up to see a man standing in the open doorway of the house. He took up almost the entire space, his head skimming the top of the door frame. He was huge; in height and muscles, and his entire torso was covered in tattoos. \n\n\u201cUh, yeah. I guess.\u201d I replied, not moving from my spot on the sidewalk. \n\n\u201cStay right there.\u201d He said. \n\nI did. I actually don\u2019t think I would have moved if he had asked me to. I looked around and realized that there was no one else on this street. I was a twenty-one-year-old woman alone in the street. I gripped my car keys. \n\nA few minutes later, the man came back out carrying a cardboard box. It was about the size of a shoebox, but stained and damp on some of the corners. \n\n\u201cCan you open your car?\u201d He asked. \n\nI opened the trunk, not wanting that inside on my car seats and he set it in. \n\n\u201cAlright, there you go.\u201d He said. \n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d I replied. \n\nI walked around to the driver's side of the car and opened the door. \n\n\u201cOh, and one more thing!\u201d He said. \n\nI looked at him. \n\n\u201cWatch out.\u201d He said. \n\nI didn\u2019t reply. \n\nI blasted my music as I drove to Jack\u2019s house, hoping it would drown out my anxiety. It didn\u2019t. \n\nI parked my car in the stone driveway and stayed inside the car, admiring the house. \n\nIt was a *huge* house; with stone pillars on the front porch, and the greenest grass I had ever seen in my life. I turned the car off and got out. I grabbed the package, and walked to the front door, getting the key from where he said it would be. \n\nI opened the door and stepped in, closing it behind me. \n\nI thought about what he had said, about locking the door when I got inside. I thought that was a little overboard, but as I stared at the closed door something made me reach out and lock it. \n\nI walked inside, my feet cushioned by the thick maroon carpet, and admired the inside of the house. All the furniture was wooden and looked incredibly expensive. I would probably finish school a dozen times with the money that it took to furnish this place. \n\nI set the package down on the coffee table, and as I walked back to the door, I heard a phone ringing from somewhere inside the house. I froze. \n\nIn my pocket, my phone buzzed. I took it out to look. \n\n**Don\u2019t answer any calls that aren\u2019t from Marvin.** \n\nI put my phone back and followed the sound of the phone, poking my head into a few different rooms before I found it in an office. \n\nI walked over to the desk and looked at the caller ID. \n\n*Incoming call from Jack.* \n\nThat was odd. \n\nI grabbed my phone to look at the message again. I was starting to get a little bit creeped out and decided I wouldn\u2019t answer, just to be safe, and left the house, remembering to lock the door as I left. \n\nI\u2019ve done a few more favors for Jack since then. I drove a BMW to a random park in another city, only to get out and drive a different car back to Jack\u2019s house. He had me meet one of his \u201cemployees\u201d at lunch, who then gave me a briefcase to deliver to the first house I had gone to and told me he would know if I looked inside. On several occasions, he asked me to drive down to that same house and stay with the guy, whose name was Julio, for a certain amount of time.\n\nIn total, I\u2019ve made around $3500. \n\nMost recently, Jack asked me to stay in his house overnight. I woke up to a text message from him. \n\n**I need you to spend the night at my house.** \n\nI hadn\u2019t ever seen him in person, but I had talked to him on the phone a few times. He proceeded to tell me he would pay me $1000 to spend the night at his house, provided that I followed a few rules. \n\nI drove to his house that evening. The driveway was empty, and it normally was, but the porch light was on. I walked up, unlocked the door, went inside and then locked it again. \n\nEverything in the house looked the same. Jack had told me over the phone that he would leave the list of rules on the dining room table. I set all my stuff down in the living room. My bags looked like garbage compared to the fancy furniture in there. \n\nI wandered into the kitchen, and then to the dining room. Sure enough, there was a piece of paper on the wooden table, held down by an empty glass. \n\n*Lock the door when you come in.* \n\n*Only answer calls from Marvin.* \n\n*Don\u2019t turn on any faucets between 9 pm and 11 pm.* \n\n*Don\u2019t open the door for anyone- no matter who they say they are- after 10 pm.* \n\n*If the door to the closet at the end of the hall is open, sleep in the library. If closed, sleep in any of the bedrooms.* \n\n*The gardener comes at midnight. If he starts knocking on the windows, hide.* \n\n*Turn the tv on and let it play on static through the night. DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS.* \n\n*Help yourself to anything in the fridge. :)*\n\n*I\u2019ll pay you in the morning. Goodnight!*\n\nI made sure to follow all the rules. To be honest, I was regretting my decision. But, seeing as I was already here, and I was getting paid, I decided to stay anyway. I figured as long as I followed all the rules, I\u2019d be perfectly fine. \n\nStill, it felt a little odd. What was this? A haunted house?\n\nNevertheless, I lounged around the house for a few hours, as I was planning on going to sleep around nine since that\u2019s the time that all the weird shit would begin to happen. At 8:50, I brushed my teeth, using the faucet for the last time before 9. \n\nI checked the closet in the hallway and upon seeing that it was open, I moved my stuff into the library and got ready to sleep on the couch. I locked to doors just in case, and laid on the couch, scrolling through my phone. I hadn\u2019t gotten any more messages from Jack, and I started to think up scenarios and reasons as to why he had such strict, peculiar sets of rules in his house. \n\nI had dozed off at some point because, at exactly 10:16 pm, I was woken up by the doorbell ringing. I was about to get up to check, but then I remembered the rule. \n\n*Don\u2019t open the door for anyone- no matter who they say they are- after 10 pm.* \n\nI stayed on the couch, trying not to move, paranoid that they would hear even the slightest sound. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the police! Open up.\u201d \n\nI didn\u2019t move. \n\n\u201cHello? It\u2019s the police! Open up or we\u2019re coming in.\u201d\n\nI still didn\u2019t move, but I could hear my heartbeat in my ears. \n\nThere was silence for a while after that. \n\nThen the doorbell rang again. \n\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s Jack! Let me in!\u201d\n\nIt sounded like Jack, but still, I didn\u2019t get up. He would have a key, wouldn\u2019t he? Why would he need me to let him in?\n\nThis continued for almost a full hour; different people would ring the doorbell, announce themselves, and then disappear when I didn\u2019t respond. \n\nI was finally able to fall asleep, and the gardener never came. \n\nWhen I woke up the next morning, I heard someone in the kitchen. I got up slowly, and unlocked the door as quietly as possible, taking my phone with me and walking across the living room and into the kitchen. \n\nI stopped at the entrance and peered in. \n\nIt was Jack. He was standing in front of the stove, stirring something as the coffee machine brewed coffee on the counter behind him. \n\n\u201cHey! Good morning!\u201d He said when he saw me. \n\n\u201cHi.\u201d I replied, nervous. \n\nI hadn\u2019t seen him in person before, but he looked exactly like his pictures online. \n\n\u201cScrambled eggs?\u201d He asked, motioning to the pan with a wooden spoon. \n\n\u201cYeah, thanks!\u201d I replied, walking over to take the plate from him. \n\nI ate my breakfast and drank some coffee in silence. \n\n\u201cSo how was it?\u201d He asked. \n\n\u201cIt was okay. Nothing super freaky happened.\u201d I replied. \n\n\u201cCool!\u201d He replied.\n\nThere was an awkwardness in the room. \n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna go now. I have class\u2026\u201d I trailed off. \n\nI didn't. But I really wanted to get out of there. \n\n\u201cOh, no! Yeah, sure! I\u2019ll talk to you some other time.\u201d He replied. \n\nI grabbed my stuff and he walked me to my car. I could see him standing in the driveway, staring at me as I left. \n\nWhen I got home, I unpacked all my stuff and noticed that I still had the list with me. I sat on my bed and read it again. I felt my body tense up as I realized that I had forgotten something. \n\n*Turn the tv on and let it play on static through the night. DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS.* \n\n*Turn the tv on and let it play on static through the night. DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS.* \n\n*DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS.* \n\nI stared at the words on the page until they lost meaning. \n\nBeside me, my phone buzzed, snapping me back to reality. \n\nIt was the $1000 payment. \n\nI looked at my phone and then back at the list. \n\nMaybe it wasn\u2019t an important step?\n\nAs I was thinking this over, a text from Jack came it. \n\n**I\u2019m not in town right now, I should be back next week, so you\u2019re free from running any more errands for me until then! Just sent the payment, go do something fun ;)**\n\nI stared at the message and read it again. \n\nAnd again. \n\nAnd once more for good measure. \n\n**I\u2019m not in town right now.** \n\nI thought back to this morning, and how Jack was in his house. How he gave me breakfast. \n\n**I\u2019m not in town right now.** \n\nWithin minutes, a new text came in this time from a number that I didn\u2019t recognize. \n\n**Did you forget to do something? ;)**\n\nThe text was followed by a picture of Jack - or, whoever this version of Jack was- standing in front of the tv. \n\nI didn\u2019t respond. \n\nNext came another picture, this one was of the outside of my house. \n\nIt was followed by another text. \n\n**Watch out.**"},"201":{"title":"My wife has been peeking at me from around corners and behind furniture. It's gone from weird to terrifying","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/sva7z6\/my_wife_has_been_peeking_at_me_from_around\/","flair":"Series","author":"Maliagirl1314","selftext":"\n\nMy wife \"Lynn\" and I have been together for six years and married for 11 months. Our entire history together has been very normal and never once have I noticed any weird behaviors or red flags. I can't stress enough how out of character this whole thing is for her.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nLynn is very kind, intelligent and thoughtful. She's always been the no nonsense type of person. Being childish, or trying to scare me is not something she'd normally do.\u00a0\n\n\n\nShe doesn't even like watching horror movies. When we first started dating she agreed to watch The Shining with me because she knew how much I loved horror. She was so scared that she didn't even make it through half of the movie before we had to turn it off. She isn't into anything creepy, and has never been into pranks. It's just not her cup of tea. And that's fine. But that's what was so strange about this. It's just so unlike her.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI should also add that she never had any mental health issues and as far as I'm aware it doesn't run in her family. I know some people are able to hide their mental health problems, but in the six years we've been together I think I'd have seen some sort of sign.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTwo months ago, I was in the kitchen making myself some coffee before work. I was running a bit late that morning and knew I wouldn't be able to make it to Dunkin Donuts for my usual morning fix.\u00a0\n\nI took a sip of my coffee as I hurried down the hall towards the front door, when I happened to notice Lynn peeking at me from around the corner ahead of me. I could only see her eyes, and a\u00a0 strand of her long dark hair hanging against the wall. The rest of her body was concealed behind the corner. I nearly spilled my coffee when I saw her. I did burn the shit out of my lips.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Geeze, Lynn.\" I said, wiping a few drops of coffee from my pants. \"You scared the shit out of me.\"\u00a0\n\nShe immediately popped out of view like a little kid that had been caught. I heard her scurry off towards the living room, and by the time I got to the front door she was out of sight.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt was really weird, and just totally out of character for her like I said, but I also found it kind of funny that she was being more playful and a little less serious. I shouted that I loved her, and called her a weirdo. As I shut the door behind me I heard her laughing.\n\n\n\nHer behavior was a bit odd, but it certainly wasn't something to call a priest over. I forgot about it by lunch and by the time I got home she was her normal self. I didn't bring it up and neither did she, and life went on.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe next incident happened three days later. It was around 2am and I had woken up to get a drink. I was standing at the kitchen island, jug of Oj in hand, when I felt a strong feeling that I was being watched.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFor whatever reason I looked down at the floor and saw my wife's smiling face staring back. She was peeking at me from the other side of the island, staring up at me with wide unblinking eyes and grinning. Grinning like the Cheshire cat.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0I screamed, I'll admit it. Not out of irritation but fear. For some reason at that moment I was scared.\u00a0\n\n\nAt the sound of my scream Lynn scuttled backwards out of my view, her hands and feet smacking the tile floor as she hurried out of the kitchen on all fours.\u00a0 I didn't run after her, or even yell after her. I just stood there frozen in shock, wondering what fuck had possessed her to do that.\n\n\n\n\u00a0It took me a little longer than I'd like to admit to go back upstairs, but I eventually did. When I got to our bedroom, Lynn was lying on her side, asleep. Or at least pretending to be. I stood there for a while, watching her breathing to be sure she really was asleep.\u00a0\n\n\nI had the feeling she might jump out at me the moment I got into bed. But she didn't. I climbed into bed and she didn't even move. Her breathing was soft and deep and I was starting to wonder if I'd dreamt the whole thing.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe next morning I waited for her to come down for coffee and after handing her a mug and kissing her cheek I decided to ask her about it.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"What was that about last night?\" I asked, keeping my tone light so I didn't offend or embarrass her.\u00a0\n\n\n\nShe frowned over her cup of coffee, shaking her head like she had no clue what I was referring to.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"You were peeking at me again. From over there.\" I said, pointing to the spot on the floor by the kitchen island.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nShe followed my gaze, and when she looked back at me she burst out laughing. She laughed so hard that I couldn't help but join her.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"You creep me the fuck out sometimes, you know that?\" I said. She giggled and set her cup on the counter and wrapped her arms around my neck.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"You creep me out all the time. So I guess we're even.\" She teased.\n\n\n\nWe said our goodbyes and left for work. As I drove I kept thinking about how creepy it had been seeing her grinning at me from behind the island like that. The sounds her hands made on the floor as she crawled away. I told myself she was just trying to be silly. Just trying to join me in my love of all things horror\u2026.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0It's not like I was afraid of her. But it still didn't sit right with me.\u00a0\n\n\nI started seeing her peeking at me more and more. Sometimes she'd be peeking out from behind the couch or living room curtains. Once she even managed to get inside her grandmother's old trunk that sits at the foot of our bed.\u00a0\n\nI might not have even known she was there at all had the trunk's old hinges not given her away.\u00a0\n\n\nShe'd had the lid propped up just enough so that\u00a0 only half of her face peeked through. She'd been grinning like an excited toddler. It was unnerving. I didn't even know what to say to her. All I could do was stare. When I finally found my voice, I asked her why on earth was she doing this. She didn't answer, but she had slowly closed the lid, shutting herself inside the trunk. I just walked away, feeling disturbed.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nI didn't understand why she was doing it, but it clearly made her happy. I just hoped she would tire of the game quickly.\u00a0\n\n\nLynn didn't peek at me for the next two weeks. I started to think she was done with her weird prank and I was relieved. We were watching a show on Netflix one night and I jokingly said that I hadn't seen her peeking at me lately, and that she must have given up on her spy game. She looked up at me with a small smile and said, \"Maybe I've just gotten better at it.\"\u00a0\n\n\nI didn't say anything but I wondered whether or not she was joking.\n\n\n\nFor the next few days I couldn't stop thinking about what she'd said. Was she still peeking at me when I wasn't looking and I just hadn't noticed? And if so, what the hell was she getting out of this? I started to feel paranoid, constantly checking whether she was watching from around the corner, or behind a door.\u00a0 I was jumpy whenever I was home and she wasn't in full view of me. I felt stupid and a little crazy.\u00a0\n\n\nBut after a few weeks without another incident, I began to relax.\u00a0 I stopped checking behind furniture and walls and told myself it was just a bad memory.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThen a few days ago things got so much worse....\n\n\nLynn left to go to a friend's, and I lounged on the couch and played a couple games on my laptop.\u00a0\n\n\nAround 9pm I hopped in the shower and as I was washing the soap from my hair, I felt that awful feeling that I was being watched. I slowly opened my eyes and almost had a fucking heart attack.\u00a0\n\n\n\nLynn was peeking from behind the shower curtain, her entire head stretched into the shower, leaving just her body outside. Her long dark hair hung against the curtain, the ends dripping with water. Her mouth hung open in a terrible grin, eyes wide and red, as if she hadn't blinked in a while. I screamed and jumped back against the wall. She didn't move nor did her smile waver. Her makeup ran down her cheeks in two black streaks. She looked giddy and completely deranged. I was fucking terrified.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe stood like that for a few moments, neither of us saying a word. Finally after what felt like forever, she slowly pulled her head back out of the shower, and I watched her blurry figure\u00a0 through the curtain as she moved backwards towards the bathroom door.\u00a0\n\n\n\nA second later the bathroom door slammed shut, hard enough to rattle the mirror. I screamed again, and jumped out of the shower to lock the door. I stayed inside the bathroom for over an hour. Maybe I overreacted to some of you. But joke or not, I wasn't going to put up with the crazy shit anymore. That's what I kept telling myself as I paced in my bathroom, stopping to listen at the door every few minutes.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSuddenly I heard a muffled sound, and I pressed my ear against the bathroom door, straining to listen. I couldn't hear anything but I envisioned Lynn standing on the other side of the door, giggling at her joke.\u00a0\n\n\nI felt a surge of anger. I was beyond pissed at being made to feel scared in my own house, and made to hide in the bathroom for an hour. All for what? Some joke? If it was a joke it was an awful one.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"What the fuck Lynn!\" I snapped. \"This shit is getting really fucking annoying.\" I waited for her to apologize, or to call me a jerk. But instead I heard a faint moan, so quiet I wondered if I heard it at all, and then complete silence.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Lynn?\" I called out, not able to even hide the shakiness in my voice. I got no response. Just my own heavy breathing.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"I swear to God, just fucking stop it!\" I yelled, pounding my fist on the door.\u00a0\n\n\nI waited for her to cuss me out, something I would expect from me talking to her like that. I never screamed at her before.\u00a0\n\n\nBut there was nothing. Just the occasional drip from the shower head.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI won't deny that I was scared. Too afraid to open the damn door and face my own wife. I waited another 30 minutes or so, which feels like a fucking lifetime when you're scared. Finally I decided I wasn't going to spend the night hiding in my bathroom, so I got down on my knees and peered under the door. I almost expected to see her face peeking back at me but thankfully I didn't. I could see straight down the hallway to the top of the stairs, but no Lynn. I didn't know if I should be happy about that or not. I looked for a few minutes, waiting to see her head pop up over the top step, but it never came.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI stood up, my hand hovering over the door and mentally prepared myself to open it. I slowly turned the lock with shaky fingers, and was about to yank it open when I heard a sound that still makes me feel nauseous when I think about it.\u00a0\n\n\n\nA moan, louder than before, but this time I was able to tell just where it was coming from. I turned my head to the closet door as if in slow motion, and locked eyes with my wife who was peeking out at me from the slight gap.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHer eyes were still wide as ever and her mouth was hanging open in the most grotesque gaping smile I'd ever seen. I didn't even scream. I was too scared for even that. Her hands were clasped to her chest, body trembling with sheer delight, as if she could barely contain her excitement. A short raspy moan bubbled up from her throat, deep and raw, sending a shiver through my entire body.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSomehow I found the ability to pull the bathroom door open and ran as fast as I could all the way down the steps, snagging my keys and phone from the table in the living room before running outside to my car. I could hear her shrill laughter behind me but I didn't hear her getting closer. I didn't bother shutting the front door. I drove away from the house faster than I legally should have, shivering the entire time, either from fear or the cold. Maybe a little of both. I hadn't grabbed a coat or even a pair of shoes. I was still in my boxers and my hair was still damp.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI drove straight to my brother Chris's house about 40 minutes away, ignoring any and every call and text I got. I didn't check my phone until I was safely parked in my brother's driveway. Lynn had called 4 times and sent a flurry of texts, all wondering where I'd gone and why I left \"like that.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI threw my phone at the dash in a rage, furious at her nonchalant attitude. My brother and his wife were surprised to see me, especially dressed in just a pair of boxers, but told me to stay as long as I needed. Chris lent me some clothes and asked me what happened. I told him Lynn and I had a fight, but didn't get into the details. I didn't want him to think I was overreacting, leaving my wife over a prank, even if it was a strange one. I mean, hadn't I encouraged her for years to lighten up instead of being so serious all the time? I had wanted her to relax and loosen up, but this was definitely not what I'd had in mind.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nI tried to sleep on their sofa, but my brain wouldn't let me sleep. Every time I closed my eyes I saw Lynn's face staring at me from inside the closet. Knowing she'd been in there with me the entire time made my skin crawl. She'd never left the fucking bathroom at all. Instead she slipped inside the closet and slammed the bathroom door shut to fool me.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe mere thought of going back home gave me anxiety. I tossed and turned, unable to sleep. Chris ended up giving me a sleeping pill so I was able to get a little rest. My sleep was filled with terrible dreams. All of Lynn's smiling face.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI woke up just as the sun started to rise. My sore body ached from the sofa, and I felt drained. I knew I'd have to call Lynn at some point, but I didn't know what to say to her. I wouldn't be going home unless she gave me her word she'd never do anymore creepy shit.\u00a0\n\n\nI just wanted my wife back. Her normal serious self never looked so good to me.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI was contemplating calling her and telling her that, when that familiar feeling came over me. I was being watched. I was staring at the ceiling, my heart in my throat. I didn't want to look away but the longer I ignored the feeling the worse it got.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMy eyes drifted away from the ceiling almost on their own. Her face was pressed up against the window beside the couch, staring down at me with that same gaping smile. Drool dribbled down her lips, leaving two long streaks down the glass. I didn't know how long she'd been there, but something told me she'd been there quite a while, possibly all night.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI didn't bother screaming, though I was afraid anger trumped any fear I felt at that moment. I jumped up from the couch and pounded my palm against the glass.\u00a0\n\n\"Lynn! Are you crazy? What the hell is wrong with you? Just go home!\" I shouted. \"Now!\"\u00a0\n\nShe didn't move, and her ghastly expression never changed. If anything her smile only grew, as if she had never been more elated.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI could hear Chris and his wife moving around upstairs. As if Lynn could hear them from her place outside, her head twitched slightly in their direction, and she began to close her mouth slowly.\u00a0\n\n\nChris called my name from upstairs, obviously concerned. I turned to see him and his wife Rebecca hurrying down the steps. When I turned back to the window Lynn was gone. The only sign she'd been there at all was the two streaks of drool still dripping down the glass.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI tried explaining to Chris and Rebecca about waking up to see Lynn watching me through their window. They were skeptical, who wouldn't be? Chris and I went outside to the spot in front of the window but there were no footprints in the dirt, just a slight indent. Animal probably, Chris guessed, and I didn't argue. He and Rebecca assumed I dreamt the entire episode but they didn't understand, and I was too tired to explain it to them.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI called out of work that day and turned my cell off. I didn't want to face Lynn. Just talking to her was too much for me at that point. I really started to believe something was irreversibly wrong with her. That no matter what promises she made we'd never be the same again. The thought saddened me to my core. I cried most of the morning. By noon I figured I was ready to confront her. Give her one last chance to explain herself. I could at least give her that after 6 years I told myself. I turned my phone on and saw the dozens of texts she'd sent, all from a seemingly concerned wife.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Can we talk?\"\n\n\n\n\"I love you.\"\n\n\n\n\"Please call me.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"I'm really worried.\"\n\n\n\n\"Can you answer?\"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Just come home.\"\n\n\n\n\nAnd more of the same. All texts telling me she loved me, and she wanted me home. How worried she was\u2026.Not a damn one addressing the crazy shit she pulled. Like she hadn't been acting like a character from a Stephen King book.\u00a0\n\n\nEven her texts were different. She normally texted novels just to tell me to pick up a loaf of bread! You'd think she'd have more to say to me after her bizarre shenanigans.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI know it probably seems childish to some of you who are miles away from this situation. But if you saw the way Lynn had looked at me, how she scampered away on all fours like some wild animal, grinning at me from inside the closet like a lunatic\u2026..then I think you'd find my reaction was warranted.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI ended up staying with Chris and Rebecca for another night. I didn't wake up yesterday until after noon, and thankfully I didn't see Lynn's face watching me through the window.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"I don't want to pry, because it's not my place. But is this fight something that can be mended?\" Rebecca asked. She'd made us both a sandwich for lunch and I knew she wanted to breach the subject without seeming to be nosy.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"I don't know. I just\u2026.. She's like a different person.\" I said, choosing my words carefully. I still wasn't ready for her or Chris to know the full extent of the bat shit craziness I had been dealing with.\n\n\n\n\"People change Ben. But she's still the same woman you married. Maybe you both just need to talk through your issues. Whatever's going on, I'm sure it can be fixed.\" She said, ever the peacemaker.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"I think it's beyond that now. I don't think talking would help. I just don't trust her.\" I said. The words stung in my heart. I missed and loved my wife. But how could I live with someone like that? Living in constant fear didn't sound too appealing.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Lynn loves you. She has to be absolutely crushed.\" She said.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"I don't know about that.\" I said.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Well she certainly seemed like it to me. I've never seen her so upset. Very much unlike the Lynn I know.\" Rebecca said, shaking her head sadly.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt took a full minute for her words to really sink in and when they did, I felt dread worming its way through my skin.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Wait. What do you mean? You saw her? You saw Lynn?\" I asked, my mouth suddenly dry.\u00a0\n\n\n\nRebecca nodded casually as if that fact wasn't nightmare fuel. Maybe for her it wasn't.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"She stopped by this morning just after Chris left for work.\"\u00a0 She said, cleaning the plates from the table. \"I didn't see her car though. Maybe she took an uber or something.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Becc. What did she say? Did..did she come inside?\" I asked, sweat starting to break out on my forehead. I began looking around, examining corners as though a predator lurked behind them.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"No. She just asked if you were awake yet and I said that you weren't. I asked if she wanted me to wake you but she said no. Just said to let you sleep.\" She said as she washed the dishes.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"That's all? She didn't say anything else?\" I asked.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"No. She looked awful though. Like she hadn't slept in days. I think you should call her.\"\n\n\n\nI got up from the table and thanked Rebecca for lunch.\u00a0\n\n\nI felt a little bit better at the knowledge that at least she hadn't come inside. Still, I needed to double check that the doors were locked.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI sat for a while trying to figure out what to do next. I didn't want to go home, but I felt that I owed it to Lynn to help her if I could. Hadn't I swore an oath to love and honor her through sickness and in health? Clearly she was very sick.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nIf she was sick, which I truly believed she was, I had to try and get her the help she needed. But I didn't even know where to start. I didn't want to call the police, and besides, what the hell was I going to tell them? That my wife was peeking at me? That she was being creepy? As bizarre as she'd been, she still hadn't committed any crime. Not yet anyway. The police would have probably said that I was overreacting. But this wasn't some prank. It felt wrong. Dangerous even. Like something sinister lurked beneath her smile.\n\n\n\nI knew as her husband I was well within my rights to have her committed, but what if she simply acted normal in their presence? She'd obviously been able to fool Rebecca into thinking she was just a concerned wife. As long as the doctors didn't find her a danger to herself or others, they'd have no choice but to release her after 72 hours. I felt lost and overwhelmed.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo I did what any husband in my position would do.\n\n\nI called her mother.\n\n\nI didn't want to, believe me.\u00a0\n\nHer mother, Marianne and I were never on the best of terms. We'd never fought or anything like that.\u00a0\n\nShe just wasn't a very warm person, and wasn't really easy to get along with.\u00a0 She hardly ever smiled and when she did, only her lips would move into a thin lipped smile, leaving her eyes as blank as before. She gave off this aura that felt like she was permanently on the offensive.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI'd only met her twice and both times were for such short visits. I got the impression she didn't approve of me for her daughter. Lynn always ushered us out quickly, as she didn't want me to feel uncomfortable which I was grateful for. Being in her mother's company felt almost unbearable. Like walking on glass. I was glad when we moved three states away so we didn't have to see her often. I was happy to avoid the woman, but I needed her help.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nI really didn't want to talk to her at all but I had to talk to someone and someone who knew Lynn better than I did. So I grit my teeth and did what I had to.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Yes?\" She answered, already sounding irritated.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Marianne, it's me Ben. Do you have a minute to talk?\" I asked. I could hear her cluck her tongue in irritation.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"I'm in the middle of writing some checks, but if you insist, I suppose I can spare a moment. What is it that you want to discuss Benjamin?\"\u00a0 She said, coolly?\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"It's about Lynn. She's been... acting strangely and I was wondering if you had any idea whether there was something - \" I was quickly interrupted.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"It's a bit difficult to follow your rambling Benjamin, what is that you want from me?\" She asked. I could almost see her standing there in her thin sweater and slacks, tapping her fingernails impatiently on the table.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"I wanted to know if you'd ever noticed any odd behavior? Or possibly any mental health issues?\" I asked. There was a long, uncomfortable pause\u00a0 that I couldn't tell was because she was just thinking, or \u2026.something else. Finally after a few seconds she spoke.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"I'm not sure if this is one of your jokes Benjamin, but if so I don't find the humor in it. Now I do have business to attend to as I've said,\u00a0 so if you don't mind -\" she said, but I cut her off before she could get rid of me.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Marianne, it's not a joke. I'm sincerely concerned about Lynn's mental health. Her behavior has been very erratic lately. I'm very worried about her and I figured as her mother you would be as well.\" I said, my frustration evident in my voice.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"If you're truly concerned then I suggest you get the health professionals involved. I don't know what you expect of me.\" She snapped. I could tell she was seconds away from hanging up and for some reason I was desperate not to let her. I had the feeling that she knew a lot more than she was letting on.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Please. If not for me, do it for Lynn.\" I tried.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI heard a faint shaky intake of breath, as if she were trying to hold her steely persona together but failing.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Marianne? What's wr-\"\u00a0 I started.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Benjamin, I don't know what to tell you. My only advice would be to seek professional help. Do not call here again. Goodbye.\" I tried to call out to her but she'd hung up.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI tried to wrap my head around the call and her refusal to help me. Even if she didn't like me, why wouldn't she want to help her own daughter? I couldn't understand that. I tried to replay the conversation, desperate to find something I missed.\n\n\n\u00a0After a while I almost gave up, until I remembered her last last words to me. 'Seek professional help' she'd said those words with a bit of urgency. I could have just been grasping at straws but no, I was sure her voice had changed ever so slightly when she'd said that. As if they were very important.\n\n\n\n\nWhat had she meant? I assumed she'd been referring to medical professionals, but maybe she was referring to someone else. Someone that she didn't, for some reason, feel comfortable saying directly. Or maybe I was just desperate.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI waited for Chris to get home and after a very long and exhausting conversation with him and Rebecca, I convinced them that Lynn truly needed psychiatric help. I didn't tell them everything. I wasn't prepared to go into it yet, but I told them about our last encounter. How she'd hidden in the bathroom, peeking at me from the closet.\u00a0\n\n\nThey were obviously shocked but thankfully they believed me. They too just wanted to help her. Still they didn't think it was all that serious. Weird, maybe but not dangerous. They just kept saying that Lynn had to be playing some kind of weird joke. \"Maybe for YouTube?\" Rebecca offered, if only half-heartedly.\u00a0\n\n\n\nChris didn't think we should involve the police just yet. He offered instead to go with me, and I readily accepted. He reasoned that calmly talking to her, trying to coax her into going willingly was the best recourse. I agreed to do it his way. At least I wouldn't be going into that house alone.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWe drove over this morning, just after breakfast. There was no way I was going at night. When we pulled into the driveway my stomach began doing somersaults. Her car wasn't there, but I still didn't let my guard down.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe front door was ajar, and for a split second I thought we'd see her eyes staring through the gap. I was shaking and starting to sweat. Chris however was fine. He waited for me to open the door, his hands in his pockets like he was going on a fucking stroll through the park. I envied his ignorance.\n\n\n\nI pushed the door open and was immediately hit with the stench of rot. Chris smelled it too, and he walked in the house behind me with his nose scrunched up.\u00a0\n\n\n\"What do you guys use to clean the floors around here, shit?\" Chris mumbled.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Shut up.\" I said, my eyes darting around for any signs of Lynn.\n\n\n\nThe house was deadly quiet and dark despite being 10 in the morning. All the curtains were closed up tight, refusing to allow any sunlight inside. If I hadn't left it just two days prior I'd have thought the house to be abandoned.\u00a0\n\n\nWe moved through each room, carefully checking any place that she might hide, occasionally calling her name.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Why the fuck are you looking under the couch?\" Chris asked eventually. \"Aren't we looking for your wife?\"\u00a0 He was looking at me like I was a moron.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Let's just go upstairs.\" I whispered. He shook his head but followed me up the stairs to check the bathroom and spare bedroom. On the way up my shoes crunched over pieces of glass that looked to be littered over a few of the steps.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI noticed that one of Lynn and my wedding portraits that hung on the wall along the staircase had been smashed. The frame hung crookedly, all the glass removed. I stared at the picture, a lump forming in my throat. We had taken the photo just after leaving the church, after saying our vows. She looked so beautiful in her white gown. I looked at Lynn's beautiful face. I never dreamed her face would ever be a source of terror for me.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nWe climbed the rest of the steps and checked the spare bedroom, but it looked completely untouched.\u00a0\n\n\nI was hesitant to go into the bathroom, my fear from that night coming back to me all at once. Chris noticed, and offered to go in by himself but I couldn't let him do that. So we walked in together, checking the closet and the shower. The bathroom looked as if it hadn't been touched since the night I left.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"I don't think she's here Ben. Why don't you pack some clothes and we'll try coming back tomorrow or something.\" Chris said. I nodded and went into our bedroom and shoved some clothes into a duffle bag. When I checked inside our closet I came across the source of the smell and gagged.\u00a0\n\n\nChris took one look and lost all color in his face. He had to go stand by the stairs to get away from the sight and smell.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0I gazed down in shock at what lay Inside my bedroom closet. Soaking into the rug, were at least a dozen eyeballs, all carefully laid out in pairs. Some were as large as a quarter while others were as tiny as a marble. I stared down at the eyes she'd collected from small animals and I wondered how she'd gotten them, and shuddered at the thought.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Man, I thought I had it bad with Becca's shoe addiction. But fuck me. Your wife's in here collecting eyeballs.\" Chris said, gagging. \u00a0\"Ben, I think we should go.\"\u00a0 He called from the hall. \"I'm getting nauseous.\"\n\n\n\n\"Alright.\" I grabbed my duffle and shut the closet door on my new nightmare. I stepped out into the hall and took a deep breath of air. I could taste the rot on my tongue and I couldn't help but gag.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Who the fuck lines up eyeballs in their closet like that?\"\u00a0 Chris mumbled.\u00a0\n\n\n\"I tried to tell you she needed help.\" I said.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"She doesn't need help, Ben. She needs a fucking exorcist.\" He said. \"You coming or what? I can't stand the smell any- \" his words died in his throat, and his eyes grew wide with fear.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI didn't ask him why. I could feel it. Someone was watching me and I didn't think it was the eyes in the closet.\u00a0 I turned around, my eyes slowly scanning the bedroom.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Christ\" I whispered, as I finally saw what we'd missed. Under the bed, curled on her side, watching us with the excitement of a kid on Christmas morning, was my wife.\u00a0\n\n\nShe held her hands together just under her chin, and they were shaking eagerly.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nNow that she knew she'd been found, I could hear the quiet noises she was making. A sort of hiccuping sound in her throat, as if the excitement was just too much for her. It was unnerving to say the least. Wide eyes, and that same huge smile.\u00a0\n\n\n\nEverything in me told me to run, but I forced it away. This was my wife. No matter how twisted, she was still the woman I married. I had to help her.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Lynn\u2026\"\u00a0 I said softly. She didn't respond, but her head bobbed back and forth in two quick little movements as if she were nodding.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Baby. I just wanna help okay? Can you\u2026. Can you let me do that?\" I asked. I had taken a single step forward, approaching her like some kind of dangerous animal.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"I love you, Lynn.\" I said softly, taking another step closer. She let a tiny moan escape her wide open mouth and I had to resist the urge to run.\u00a0 Her shoulders were starting to quiver, and her eyes grew as large as saucers.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI crouched down so I could see her better, and immediately saw the blood. Her hands were covered in it. They trembled more the closer I got, as if she was barely able to contain herself.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Lynn. Are you hurt? You're bleeding.\" I said. She bobbed her head again, her bloody fingers moving up and down as if playing an invisible piano. They occasionally grazed her chin, leaving smears of blood on her skin.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI wanted to recoil in disgust. The smell that was coming off of her was revolting. I could feel the vomit trying to climb up my throat.\u00a0\nHer lips were dry and stretched thin, blood seeping between the cracks. \n\n\nI knew she wouldn't come out on her own, but I didn't want to leave her in the state she was in.\u00a0\n\n\nI scooted closer and reached out to her. The excited hiccuping sounds got louder and her hands shook, fingers flexing. It was then that I could see the blood oozing from in between her fingers.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Oh my God, Lynn. You're bleeding.\" I said. Instinctively I reached out to take her hand, but before I could even touch her, her hand sprang out towards me. A sharp pain shot through my arm, and I fell back on my ass. My arm burned, and I could see the blood dripping down onto the carpet.\u00a0\n\n\nI looked back at her in shock and saw her grinning madly, her fingers clutching a large shard of glass.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"You alright in there?\" Chris asked from behind me.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI turned my head slightly, and nodded to him, cradling my arm to my chest. When I turned back to face Lynn, I saw that her focus had shifted. She wasn't looking at me anymore. And she wasn't smiling anymore either.\u00a0\n\n\n\nShe was staring past me, her eyes glaring at Chris the way a hungry lion might stare at an antelope. Her mouth was still hanging open but it was twisted into a snarl.\n\n\nI got to my feet, and began walking backwards down the hall, afraid to take my eyes off her.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Are you... bleeding?\" Chris asked. The moment the words left his mouth Lynn started fast scooting out from under the bed, the glass shard still in her fist.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Chris. Run. Go!\" I yelled. He must have been too afraid to move because a second later I felt my back bump into him. He was still standing at the top of the stairs, staring at the horror that was my wife.\u00a0\n\n\n\nLynn had crawled completely out from under the bed and stood in the bedroom doorway, her face twisted in rage. Her whole body was visibly tense. Blood ran down her fingers and onto the floor.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Jesus, Lynn...\" Chris said, \"You uh\u2026 playing hide and seek?\" I reached back and pushed him towards the steps.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Move your ass Chris\" I said as quietly but firmly as I could.\u00a0\n\n\n\nLynn bobbed her head in fast, sharp motions, and began to grin, stretching her mouth open wider and wider so that her chin seemed to touch her chest. I heard Chris mutter a prayer and then he was running down the stairs. I stood at the top of the steps, stuck between the love for a woman who clearly needed serious help, and self preservation.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\"I only want to help.\" I said, choking back tears. Her eyes focused on me once again as she slowly lifted the glass, holding it out in front of her. And then she started sprinting towards me, grinning with utter excitement. Thankfully my body took over and I flew down the stairs skipping two or three at a time. I made it to the front door before I felt her leap onto my back, wrapping her arms around my neck, her open mouth next to my ear so that I could hear those terrible hiccuping sounds up close. I shook her off me, knocking her to the floor. I felt a searing pain in my back as she went but I tore open the front door and bolted to my car.\u00a0\n\n\n\nChris was standing in the front yard, talking on the phone with the police. I didn't say a word, I just ran to my car and jumped in. Chris took the hint and followed me, still on the line with 911\n\n\n\nI watched the rear view mirror, sure I'd see her there, running after us. But I never did.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI went straight to the ER and got 11 stitches in my arm and 3 on my back. The police asked a lot of questions and went back to the house to do a search but of course, Lynn wasn't there.\u00a0\n\n\nThey advised me to stay with a friend or relative for a while and to file a restraining order as soon as I could but none of those things would matter. Somehow I just knew.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI dropped Chris off at home, and went to a motel an hour away. I wanted to put as much distance between me and Lynn as I could.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThis is where I've been for the last 4 hours. I thought maybe the police would find her, maybe they'd get her the help she desperately needs.\u00a0\n\n\nBut now I don't think so. Because 40 minutes ago I got a text from an unknown number. Just three words :\n\n\n\n\"I found You.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\nAnd a picture attached. The picture was dark and grainy, but I instantly knew what it was. There was no mistaking my wife's eye.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI started typing this out immediately after. I don't know what to do. I'm alone and scared, and I can't help but feel that I'm being watched\u2026."},"202":{"title":"Something walks whistling past my house every night at 3:03.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/dyqd5e\/something_walks_whistling_past_my_house_every\/","flair":null,"author":"Grand_Theft_Motto","selftext":"Every night, no matter the weather, something walks down our street whistling softly. You can only hear it if you\u2019re in the living room or the kitchen when they walk by and it always starts at exactly 3:03. The sound starts faint, somewhere near the beginning of the lane near the Carson place. We\u2019re towards the middle of the street, so the whistling moves past us before fading away in the direction of the cul de sac.\n\nWhen I was younger, my sister and I would sneak into the kitchen some nights to listen. Mom and dad didn\u2019t like that and we\u2019d catch Hell if they found us out there but they were never too hard on us since we always stuck to the one Big Rule.\n\nDon\u2019t try to look at whatever was whistling.\n\nMy neighborhood is a funny place. I\u2019ve lived here since I was six and I love it. The houses are small but well-kept, good-sized yards, plenty of places to roam. There are a lot of other kids here my age, I turned 13 back in October. We grew up together and would always play four square in the cul de sac or roam around from back porch to back porch in the summer. This was a good place to grow up, I\u2019m old enough to see it. And there\u2019s only the two strange things here; the night whistling and the good luck.\n\nThe whistling never bothered me much. Like I said, I couldn\u2019t even hear it from my bedroom. But mom and dad don\u2019t like talking about it, so I\u2019ve stopped asking questions. My dad is a strong guy, tall and calm. He has an accent since he moved to the US as a kid. His family, my grandparents, they\u2019re from the islands. That\u2019s what they call it. My dad, the only time he isn\u2019t so calm is if the whistler comes up.\n\nHe talks a little quicker then, eyes move faster, and he tells us not to think about it so much and to always remember the one rule, the Big Rule: don\u2019t try to look outside when the whistler goes past.\n\nNot that we could look even if we wanted. See, there are shutters on the inside of every window, thick pieces of heavy canvas that pull down from the top and latch to the bottom of the window frame. Each latch even has a small lock, about the size of what you\u2019d find on a diary. My dad locks those shutters every night before we all go to bed and keeps the key in his room.\n\nMy mom\u2026I don\u2019t know what she thinks about the whistling. I\u2019ve seen her out in the living room before at 3:03 when the sound starts; I could see her if I cracked my door open just an inch to peek. She\u2019s not out there often, at least I haven\u2019t caught her much, but once or twice a month I think she sits out there on our big red couch just listening.\n\nThe whistler has the same tune every night. It\u2019s\u2026cheerful.\n\n*Da da dada da dum. Da da dada da dum.*\n\nRemember how I said there are two odd things about where I live? Well, besides our night whistler, everyone in my neighborhood is really lucky. It\u2019s hard to explain and dad doesn\u2019t like us talking about this part much, either, but good things just seem to happen to people around here a lot. Usually, it\u2019s small things, winning a radio contest, or getting an unexpected promotion at work, or finding some arrowheads buried in the yard, you know, the authentic kind.\n\nThe weather is pretty good and there\u2019s no crime and everybody\u2019s gardens bloom extra bright in the fall. \u201cA million little blessings,\u201d I\u2019ve heard my mom say about living here. But the main reason we stay here, why we moved here in the first place, is my sister Nola. She was born very sick, something with her lungs. We couldn\u2019t even bring her home when she was born, only visit her in the hospital. She was so small, I remember, small even compared to the other babies. A machine had to breathe for her.\n\nWe moved into our house here to be closer to the hospital. As soon as we moved here, Nola starting getting better. The doctors couldn\u2019t figure it out, they chalked it up to whatever they were doing but we all could tell they were confused. But my parents knew, even I knew, Nola getting better was just another of the million little blessings we got for living in our neighborhood.\n\nSo that\u2019s why we stayed even after we found out that, for every small miracle that happens here every day, now and then\u2026some bad things happen. But they only happen if you look for the whistler.\n\nSee, our neighborhood has a Welcoming Committee. They show up with macaroni casserole and a gift basket and a manila folder whenever someone new moves in. They\u2019re very friendly. Four people showed up when we moved in seven years ago. The committee made small talk, gave me a Snickers bar, and took turns holding Nola. It was her first week out of the hospital so they were extra careful.\n\nThen the committee asked to speak to my parents in private so I was sent to my room where I still managed to hear nearly every word. The Welcoming Committee told my parents about how nice the neighborhood was, really exceptionally, hard-to-explain kind of nice. And then they told my parents about the even harder-to-explain whistling that happened every morning at 3:03 and ended at the tick of 3:05. The group, our new neighbors, warned my parents that the whistling was quiet, would never harm or hurt us, as long as we didn\u2019t look for what was making the sound.\n\nThis part they stressed and I pushed my ear into the door straining to hear them. People who went looking for the whistler had their luck change, sometimes tragically. A black cloud would hang over anyone that looked. Anything that could go wrong, would. The manila envelope the committee brought over contained newspaper clippings, stories about car crashes and ruined lives, public deaths and freak accidents.\n\n\u201cNot everyone dies,\u201d I heard the head of the committee tell my dad. \u201cBut the life goes out of \u2018em. Even if they live, there\u2019s no light in them ever again, no presence.\u201d\n\nMy mom, I could tell she wasn\u2019t taking it seriously. She kept asking if this was some prank they play on new neighbors. At one point my mom got angry, accused the committee of trying to scare us out of our new home, asked them if they were racist on account of my dad being from the islands. My dad calmed her down, told her he could tell our new neighbors were sincere and they were just trying to help us. He explained that he grew up hearing these kinds of stories from his mom and that he knew there were strange things that walked among us. Some of those strange things were good and some were bad but most were just different.\n\nAfter the committee left, dad went out to the hardware store, bought the canvas blinds, the latches, and the locks and installed them on every window in the house after dinner. That first night in our new house, I crept out of my room at 3 a.m. only to find my dad awake sitting on the living room couch, holding my baby sister. My dad held up his finger in a shh motion but patted the couch next to him. I sat and we waited.\n\nAt exactly 3:03 we heard the whistling.\n\n*Da da dada da dum. Da da dada da dum.*\n\nIt came and it went just like our neighbors said. The whistling returns each night and we never look and we enjoy our million little blessings every day. Nola breathes on her own and she\u2019s grown into a strong, clever girl. My dad even joined the Welcoming Committee. We don\u2019t get new neighbors often, why would anyone want to leave? But when a new family moves in, my dad and the committee bring them macaroni casserole, a gift basket, and the manila folder. I can always tell by the look on my dad\u2019s face when he comes back if the family took the committee seriously or if we\u2019d be getting new neighbors again very soon.\n\nNot long ago a family moved in directly next to us. The previous owner, Ms. Maddie, passed away at age 105. She\u2019d lived a good, long life. Our new neighbors seemed like they\u2019d fit in just fine. They believed the Welcoming Committee, took my dad\u2019s advice about the locking shutters since they had a young child of their own. Whatever newspaper clippings were in that manila envelope, whatever evidence, my dad never let us see. But I imagine it must have been awfully convincing since our neighbors got along with no issues for the first month.\n\nOne night, when our new neighbors had to leave town, they sent their son, Holden, to stay with us. He was 12, a year under me in school. I didn\u2019t know him well before that night but as soon as his parents dropped him off after dinner I could tell it was going to be a bad time.\n\n\u201cDo you know who is always out there whistling every night?\u201d Holden asked the moment the adults left the room.\n\nThe three of us were sitting in the den, some Disney movie playing idly on the television.\n\nMy sister and I exchanged a glance. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about that,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s that weirdo that lives in the big yellow house on the corner,\u201d Holden said.\n\n\u201cMr. Toles?\u201d my sister asked. \u201cNo way, he\u2019s really nice.\u201d\n\nHolden shrugged. \u201cMust be a psycho killer, then.\u201d\n\nNola tensed.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about it,\u201d I repeated. \u201cLet\u2019s go in my room and play Nintendo.\u201d\n\nWe spent the next few hours playing games, eating popcorn and then watching movies. A typical sleepover but I could see Holden was getting antsy.\n\nAfter my parents had wished us a good night, locked the blinds, and gone to bed, Holden stood up from his bean bag and walked over to where Nola and I were sitting on my bed.\n\n\u201cHave you ever even tried looking?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly time.\u201d\n\nLike most sleepovers, we\u2019d conveniently ignored any suggestion of a bedtime. I was shocked to see he was right; it was almost 3 a.m.\n\nI sighed. \u201cWe don\u2019t-\u201d\n\n\u201cSee, I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t even try to look because my dad locks the blinds every night and hides the key,\u201d he continued, ignoring me.\n\n\u201cSo does our dad,\u201d said Nola.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied Holden. \u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou saw him do it,\u201d I said, a little sharper than I meant to sound.\n\nHolden grinned. \u201cYour dad locks the blinds, yeah, but he doesn\u2019t hide the key. He keeps it right on his normal key chain.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d I asked, worried I already knew what he would say next. Because I had noticed that my dad didn\u2019t bother hiding the key anymore after all of these years. Because he knew we took it seriously.\n\n\u201cSo, after your dad locked up but before your parents went to bed, I went to the bathroom. And on my way, I may have peeked into their room, and I may have seen your dad\u2019s key chain on his nightstand, and I maybe went and borrowed the key to blinds.\u201d\n\nNola and I stared and his grin only grew wider.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d I said.\n\nHolden shrugged. \u201cYou can check if you want. Just open your parents\u2019 door and look, you\u2019ll see his keychain right there on the nightstand.\u201d\n\n\u201cStay here,\u201d I told both of them. \u201cDon\u2019t move a muscle.\u201d\n\nI hurried over to my parents\u2019 room but hesitated at the door. If Holden wasn\u2019t lying\u2026my dad would be angry. Beyond angry. I was scared thinking about it. But more scared of an open window with the whistler right outside. I opened the door, barely an inch, and looked in but it was too dark to see. Taking a deep breath, I walked into the room.\n\nTwo steps into the dark I froze. The whistling started. And I could hear it clearly\u2026from my parents\u2019 room. I never realized but they must have heard the sound every night since we moved into the house. They never told us. I don\u2019t think I could have slept through it.\n\nI stood there, listening to the whistling come closer, unsure whether I should turn on a light or call out for my dad. Soft sounds from the living room brought me back to reality.\n\n\u201cNola,\u201d I yelled, running out of my parents\u2019 room.\n\nHolden and Nola were standing near the front door next to a window. Holden wasn\u2019t lying. I could see him fumbling with the lock on one of the blinds. I heard a click. He did have the key.\n\nHolden let out a quick laugh. Nola stood next to him, hunched up, afraid but maybe curious. The whistling was right outside our house now.\n\nI think I made a sound, called out. I can\u2019t remember. Time felt frozen, clock hands nailed to the face. But I found myself moving. I\u2019m not fast, I\u2019ve never been athletic. Somehow, though, I covered the space between myself and Nola in a moment. My eyes were locked on her but I heard Holden pull the blind all the way down so it could release. I heard the snap of it start to raise, and I heard the whistling just on the other side of the window.\n\nBut I had my arms around Nola and I turned us so she was facing away from the window. At the same time, I jammed my eyes shut.  The blind whipped open.\n\nThe whistling stopped.\n\nI felt Nola shaking in my arms.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look, okay?\u201d I told her. \u201cDon\u2019t turn around.\u201d\n\nWe were positioned so that she was facing back towards the hallway and I was facing the window. My eyes were still closed. I felt her nod into my shoulder.\n\nI reached out with the arm not holding Nola and tried to touch Holden. My hand brushed against his arm. He was shaking worse than Nola.\n\n\u201cHolden?\u201d I asked.\n\nSilence.\n\nI reached past him and gingerly felt for the window, eyes still sealed shut. The glass was cold against my fingertips. Colder than it should have been for the time of year. I moved my hand up the window, searching for the string to the blind. The glass began to get warmer the further I reached and there was a gentle hum feeding back into my fingertips. I tried not to think about what might be on the other side of the window. Finally, I touched the string and yanked the blinds shut.\n\nI opened my eyes. In the dim light leaking out from the kitchen, I could make out Holden, pale and small, staring at the now closed window.\n\n\u201cHolden?\u201d I asked again.\n\nHe turned towards me and he *screamed.*\n\nEverything became a flurry of motion. Lights sparked to life in the hall, then the living room. My parents\u2019 footsteps thudded across the hardwood floor. I didn\u2019t turn to look back at them, my eyes were glued to Holden.\n\nHe was pale, had bit his lip so hard there was a thin red line of blood running down his chin and he\u2019d wet himself.\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d my dad asked from behind me.\n\nI managed to swivel away from Holden and look back. \u201cHe looked.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d never seen my dad scared before but I saw it that night, in that moment, an old, ugly terror stitched on his face. A parent\u2019s fear.\n\n\u201cJust Holden?\u201d he mouthed to me.\n\nI nodded yes.\n\nMy dad let out a breath. He looked so relieved I nearly expected him to cheer. But then he turned to Holden and my dad\u2019s face changed. I wondered if he felt bad for feeling good that Holden was the only one that looked.\n\nThere was a knock at the door.\n\nWe all froze. Holden whimpered.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t answer it,\u201d my mom said.\n\nShe stood at the threshold of the hall. I\u2019d always thought she was a skeptic and just humored my dad about the windows and the whistler but that night we were all believers. I noticed that both of my parents held baseball bats they must have taken from their bedroom.\n\nThe knock came again, a little louder this time.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t open the door,\u201d Holden whispered.\n\nMy dad walked over to him, hugged him close.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t,\u201d my dad promised, still holding his bat. \u201cNothing is coming in here tonight.\u201d\n\nThud thud thud\n\nThis time the knocking was loud enough to rattle the door. Holden screamed again and Nola clutched her arms around my neck. My mom came over and knelt down next to us, wrapping my sister and me close.\n\n**Thud thud thud**\n\n\u201cCall the police,\u201d my mom whispered to my dad.\n\nThe knocking instantly stopped. My dad looked over his shoulder at us.\n\n\u201cDo you think-\u201d\n\nHe was cut off by frantic knocking that trailed off to a polite tap tap tap.\n\n\u201c*Police*,\u201d something said from the other side of the door.\n\nThe voice from outside sounded exactly like my mom, like a parrot repeating the words back to her.\n\n\u201c*Police*. *Call*. *The police*.\u201d **tap tap tap** \u201c*Police*.\u201d\n\nMy mom pulled us closer.\n\n\u201c*Police*. *Police*. *Police*. *Police*.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease stop,\u201d I heard her whisper.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think calling them will help,\u201d my dad said. \u201cHow will we know when they\u2019re the ones at the door?\u201d\n\nThe knocking came back harder than before. The door shook. Then it stopped. After a long moment, I heard the knocking again but it was coming from our backdoor.\n\nWe all turned together towards the backdoor but the knocking immediately returned to the front door. Front to back, back to front, loud then quiet then loud again. Suddenly, the sound was coming from both doors at once, big, heavy blows like a sledgehammer. Then something started rapping against all of the windows in the house, then the walls. It was like we were living inside a drum with a dozen people trying to play at once. Or we were a turtle and something was attempting to claw us out of our shell.\n\n\u201cSTOP!\u201d Holden yelled.\n\nThe knocking died.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t tell,\u201d Holden said, staring at the door. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t tell anyone what I saw. Just please go away.\u201d\n\nWe waited for nearly a minute. Then we heard it, a soft *tap tap tap* coming from the window Holden had looked through earlier.\n\nHolden started to cry, sobbing like a prisoner watching gallows being built outside their cell.\n\nMy dad held him, brushed his hair but never lied to him, never told him things would be okay.\n\nThe tapping at the window went on for the rest of the night. We huddled together in the living room for I don\u2019t know how long. Eventually, my mom tried to take us kids into my room while my dad stayed to watch the door. But the second we moved into my bedroom the knocking came back, so loud it was possible to ignore. I was afraid the door couldn\u2019t take it.\n\nWe went back to the living room and the knocking stopped. Only the tap tap tap on the window remained. None of us slept that night.\n\nThe tapping stopped around 7 a.m. That\u2019s about the time the sun comes up here. We waited another two hours before my dad opened the blinds from one window. He made us all go back to my parents\u2019 bedroom first. I heard him open the door then come back in.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he told us. \u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d\n\nHolden\u2019s parents came back around lunchtime. My mom and dad walked Holden over to his house and they all went inside for quite a while. Nola and I watched from the window. She stuck to me the whole day, right at my side, sometimes holding my hand. When my parents came back they looked grim but wouldn\u2019t tell us what they said to Holden\u2019s family. It was a Sunday so we all spent the day together, ordered pizza and watched movies.\n\nThat night everyone slept in my room, Nola and my mom in the bed with me, my dad in a chair he\u2019d pulled over. There was no knocking that night or any night since.\n\nWe didn\u2019t see much of Holden or his parents for the rest of that week but by Thursday there was a moving truck in their driveway. Nola and I watched them packing up the whole afternoon after school. What sticks with me most is how tired Holden and his parents looked. All three had the same pallor, grim mouths and light-less eyes. Even from across the street I could tell something was very wrong. Holden and his family were gone before sunset.\n\nI remember what the original Welcoming Committee said to my parents when we moved in. Not everyone who looks at the whistler dies, but even those that live have the light go out of them and the rest of their lives are full of misfortune. A million little tragedies.\n\nI think Holden\u2019s parents must have looked, either to comfort him if they didn\u2019t believe or share the burden if they did. I watch Nola some days, happy and young and alive, and I wonder if I\u2019d been slower, if she\u2019d looked out the window that night\u2026would I have looked too? To comfort her? To share that burden? I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to find out.\n\nWe still live in that house, in that neighborhood. We still hear our whistler walking past every night. The blessings, the luck, the good things here are too good to leave. But we\u2019re careful. We don\u2019t have friends over to spend the night anymore. And my dad hides the key to the blinds very, very well. Not that I\u2019ve gone looking. Some things you just don\u2019t need to look for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GTM](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Grand_Theft_Motto\/comments\/emzy3b\/the_stories\/)\n\n[Hello](https:\/\/travisbrownwriting.com)"},"203":{"title":"She Sold Happiness in Glass Jars","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/b4vyxc\/she_sold_happiness_in_glass_jars\/","flair":null,"author":"flard","selftext":"The poster read, \u201cHappiness! Sold in Glass Jars! Call Today!\u201d and underneath the text was a phone number.\n\nI was walking home from a long, exhausting day of work when I caught a glimpse of the paper stapled on an old telephone pole. I took a picture of it thinking it was amusing.\n\nI was going to show my wife once I got to our apartment, but I was caught up with chores and forgot about it\u2014dinner, dishes, laundry, packing a snack for our daughter, putting her to bed, then putting her toys away that she\u2019d left out in the living room\u2014every night, it was the exact same routine.\n\nThe next day, I awoke sleeping back-to-back with my wife. I always had to get up earlier than she did for my job, so I quietly got ready for the day and headed out the door.\n\nAt work, I was updating the company\u2019s latest expense report. Most days were similar to this one. They were basically paying me to stare at a computer for nine hours a day and input a couple numbers in to a spreadsheet. I finished my work very quickly, so I decided to head out of the office early\u2014it also helped that it was a Friday, and a lot of people leave early at the end of the week.\n\nOn my walk back, I was thinking of what my life had become. I did this often. I always dreamed of traveling when I was younger. I wanted to drive across the country or solo-backpack across Europe. Then I met Kelsey. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I loved Kelsey. I mean, I still do. We just don\u2019t have that spark anymore. When you meet someone and get in a relationship, whether it\u2019s *meant to be* or not, some of your personal life-plans have to be put on hold. And then that relationship turns to marriage, and then you have a baby, then you have to enroll your daughter in a preschool, then you have to get a better paying job and work more hours and blah, blah, blah.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to throw a pity party for myself. I\u2019m just saying I wasn\u2019t exactly content with where I was in my life. I wouldn\u2019t have referred to myself as a happy person.\n\nAs I took the same route home that I did every day to work and back, I walked by the same poster I had passed the day before. I don\u2019t know why, I really don\u2019t, but I decided to call the number. I figured it would be some joke. Maybe someone just picks up and says, \u201cI love you!\u201d on the other end and hangs up. Or maybe it\u2019s a line to a sex-worker. I had no idea what to expect.\n\nI called. It only rang once before someone picked up.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d a woman said. \n\n\u201cUh, hi\u2014um, I\u2019m calling about your poster? Your ad?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, awesome,\u201d she said calmly, \u201cwhen do you wanna pick it up?\u201d\n\n\u201cPick what up?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe jar\u2026\u201d she said, like it was the most obvious thing in the world.\n\n\u201cOh, of course, um,\u201d I realized then that I had left work early without telling Kelsey, so I could just go pick it up now and she\u2019d be none the wiser, \u201cwhat exactly is it? That your selling?\u201d\n\n\u201cI just told you. It\u2019s happiness. In a glass jar. Like the poster said. Happiness keeps best in glass jars. They\u2019re more durable than, say, a plastic bag.\u201d\n\n\u201cUm, okay. Should we meet somewhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor sure. I don\u2019t want you to end up being a creep or something, so let\u2019s go to a public place.\u201d\n\nThe public place we decided on was a Starbucks parking lot a little over a mile from me.\n\nNow, I didn\u2019t think I was really going to be buying a *jar of happiness* or whatever. I was 99% sure she was going to sell me drugs. Maybe heroine would be in the jar. I remember thinking, *Oh no, \u2018happiness\u2019 is probably a nickname for some street drug and I\u2019m going to a drug deal. What if she\u2019s a cop? Am I going to be arrested?* But something inside me told me to keep walking, and so I did.\n\nI stood outside and texted her.\n\nMe: **I\u2019m here.**\n\nHer: **Cool. Be there in a sec.**\n\nMe: **What are you driving?**\n\nHer: **Silver Camry.**\n\nAnd as her final text came through, I saw her car pull in. She took a spot not too far from where I stood. I could see there was no one else in the car, which put my kidnapping fear to rest. She opened her door and stood on the pavement, looking around until her eyes met mine. I gave her a little nod of acknowledgment. She simply responded by waving her hand, gesturing for me to come over to her car, so I did.\n\nShe was young, maybe mid-twenties, with curly, golden hair. Her skin was pale and contrasted with the all-black outfit she was wearing. I thought she looked like Glinda the Good Witch from *The Wizard of Oz* had put on the Wicked Witch\u2019s clothes.\n\n\u201cNice day out,\u201d she said as a greeting.\n\n\u201cOh, yeah it is. Hadn\u2019t really paid attention to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou *were* the one that called about the jar, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that was me.\u201d\n\n\u201cCool, well, here you go.\u201d\n\nShe handed me a very small, glass mason-jar. It couldn\u2019t have been more than two inches tall. Inside of it was a light. Not a light bulb\u2014just light. It was like someone bottled up sunshine. It glowed even in the midafternoon daylight. It looked like a tiny sun, or a tiny universe existing in this little crystal-walled home. I was admiring it with no attempt to hide the awe on my face.\n\n\u201cPretty rad isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2014what is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve asked that, like, three different times, I think. My answer is still the same. It is happiness. Happiness in a glass jar.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do I do with it?\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep it,\u201d She said simply, \u201cif you have any problems shoot me a text.\u201d\n\nShe started to get into her car.\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d I said, \u201cI thought you were selling this? How much is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, man,\u201d she said with a smile, \u201cyou\u2019ll pay.\u201d\n\nShe closed her door and I stepped out of her way as she backed up, then drove off. What the hell had just happened? What was I holding? I looked down at the jar again, its radiance was simply mesmerizing. I put it in my pocket and could see its glow slightly through my pants. I began to walk home.\n\nWhat was just a nice, sunny day, quickly changed into a rainy one with clouds wrapping the sky. It was not forecasted that it would rain, or else I would\u2019ve ridden the bus or subway to work that day. I jogged home trying not to get too drenched. I finally found shelter once I made it to my apartment building.\n\nI walked up to my door and found that my key wasn\u2019t on my key ring anymore. *Shit, I can\u2019t believe I lost it again,* I thought.\n\nI knocked on the door and said in a somewhat loud voice, \u201cHey babe it\u2019s me, I don\u2019t know what happened to my key.\u201d I heard the door being unlocked from the other side.\n\nWhen the door opened, I was greeted by a large, heavy-set man with greasy hair and unkempt goatee, he said, \u201cI think you got the wrong door, bud.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d I said, disoriented, \u201cmy bad, sorry, have a good one.\u201d\n\nHe let out a chuckle as he closed the door. \n\nApartment number 33.\n\nI know that was my apartment. I know it was. I\u2019d been in apartment 33 for five years now. But *that* was not my apartment. From what I could see inside, all the furniture was different, it was painted a different color, it was all wrong. I felt like I\u2019d hit my head and was drugged. In that moment, nothing made sense.\n\nI pulled out my phone to call Kelsey so she could calm me down and tell me I just got confused for a second. But her contact wasn\u2019t in my phone. In fact, nothing was in my phone. I had no messages with her. No previous calls. No pictures. It was like my phone reset to its factory settings. Did that girl somehow switch my phone out when I wasn\u2019t looking? I would\u2019ve just dialed Kelsey's number manually, but I couldn\u2019t quite remember it. I had known it by heart before, but not anymore. I needed to get back to the office, I had all my contacts backed up on my work computer.\n\nSince it was still raining, I hopped on the bus which had a stop right in front of the apartment complex. I rode downtown toward my office, the whole time staring at my wet shoes, wondering what the hell was going on.\n\nWe have a keycard access to our building so only authorized personnel can get inside. I always keep my access card in my wallet, always. But, surprise, surprise\u2014it wasn\u2019t there. I buzzed in to the speaker we had for guests with appointments, or employees as a back-up in case anyone lost or forgot their card. \n\n**BZZZ** \n\n\u201cHey this is Tim, I must\u2019ve lost my card. My employee number is\u2026\u201d I stopped as I drew a blank.\n\nA voice came through the Speaker, \u201cTim? You got cut out, what\u2019s your employee number?\"\n\n\u201cUm, I can\u2019t remember, I\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine, just tell me your full name and department.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh, finance. I\u2019m in finance. My full name is Tim Brooks.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne sec.\u201d\n\nAbout thirty seconds later, the man spoke to me again.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a Tim Brooks working in this building. Did you have an appointment with someone?\u201d\n\nI backed up in surprise, almost tripping on my own feet. I had just been in that office an hour or two ago. What was happening to me? I felt like I was getting Alzheimer\u2019s but going through every stage in one day. I stared at my hands, unsure if I was in the right body. I felt like the world around me was disintegrating. I wasn\u2019t in control, I was merely sitting inside somebody else\u2019s head, watching the world through their eyes.\n\nJust then, I got a text. I recognized the number immediately, it was that girl. The one who gave me the jar. I had forgotten all about it until I saw her text.\n\nHer: **Hey. How\u2019s it going?**\n\nI looked at my phone, dumbfounded. It made me angry she was so nonchalant about this. *She* knew what was going on. *She* had done this somehow.\n\nMe: **What the hell did you do to me?!**\n\nHer: **The worst is yet to come.**\n\nI was astronomically close to just chucking my phone as far as I could in frustration. I took the jar out of my pocket. It looked unchanged, still glowing just as bright.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck did you do!\u201d I yelled at the jar, realizing I probably looked like a lunatic.\n\nAs I stared at its glistening glass, I realized something. I didn\u2019t know what my wife\u2019s face looked like anymore. I knew her name. Well, I know it started with a K, or maybe a C. I couldn\u2019t picture her in my mind. I knew I had a wife. I knew I did. Yes, because I had a daughter. I had a wife and a daughter. I just, couldn\u2019t remember their faces then\u2014or their names, or their birthdays, or any memories I had with them.\n\nI know they existed. They did exist. I had just seen them that morning, right? I couldn\u2019t remember how she looked, or what she smelled like. What was our first date? We had a wedding, right? What about our first kiss? Or my daughter\u2014or was it my son? Maybe I didn\u2019t even have a kid. But my wife, or girlfriend, she was real. I knew she was. The thought was tearing me apart. I couldn\u2019t see her in my head. I couldn\u2019t recall a single fact about her.\n\nI was standing outside of the same building, but I was unsure why I was. Did I work there? I must work somewhere. The rain was accompanied by a chilly wind now. It was whipping at my face, making my nose and cheeks sting. I wanted to go home. I wanted to be with her. I wanted to be warm. I wanted to go in to a shitty office job that kept a roof over my head. I wanted it all. I was soaking wet. I was miserable. I couldn\u2019t remember my parents, or my childhood. Did I even have any friends? Why was I in the rain?\n\nI looked down at my hand. I was still clutching the jar. The only memory of my entire life I could concretely remember was that girl giving it to me. Telling me it was happiness. It did not bring happiness. It brought pain. It bought suffering. I was more miserable in that moment than I\u2019d ever been.\n\nMy phone buzzed:\n\n**Break the jar, Tim.**\n\nI looked at my other hand. With the setting sun and the rainy sky, I swear the jar glowed brighter than any street light near me. I didn\u2019t break it because I was following her instruction. I broke it because I was angry. I broke it because I was upset. I needed a release. I raised my arm above my head, and brought it down with one swift motion, shattering the jar on the concrete beneath my feet.\n\nThat dark, chilly air accompanying the rain spread away like it was the shockwave of a bomb going off, and I was at the epicenter. I saw the warm, yellow light from inside the jar spread rapidly across the ground and ascend into the sky. It was as if I was watching the beginnings of the universe being created\u2014like God had just snapped his fingers and said, \u201clet there be light.\u201d I was engulfed in it. I could no longer see street or rain, or anything dark. I felt like I was plummeting into a star going faster than the speed of light. It felt like sitting in front of a fire on a cold winter\u2019s night, but that warmth was covering every inch by body.\n\nAnd then I blinked.\n\nImmediately I could feel the sheets beneath me, and my back barely touching my wife\u2019s. I was staring out the window. The morning light drenched through the glass and gleamed on my face.\n\nI stood from bed and grabbed my phone. It was Friday morning. I had one text:\n\n**Let me know if you ever need another jar :)**\n\nI called in sick to work. I snuck into my daughter\u2019s room and greeted her with a kiss and told her she didn\u2019t have to go to preschool today. We were going to have a family day. She smiled and stretched out her arms with a yawn before curling up and falling back asleep. \n\nI got back in bed and squeezed my wife tightly. I didn\u2019t let go for hours. Our daughter came into our room and woke us up eventually\u2014she was jumping on the bed and shouting for us to wake up. Yesterday I may have found that annoying. Yesterday I may have found a lot of things annoying, or monotonous, or dull.\n\nBut not today. Today, I pulled her under the covers in between me and Kelsey.\n\nToday was going to be a good day. Today, I was happy."},"204":{"title":"A Shattered Life","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/7txais\/a_shattered_life\/","flair":null,"author":"M59Gar","selftext":"I don't know when you're going to read this, but I can tell you when it started: I was out for a walk alone in the woods when the entity came for me. It was beyond a blur. It was, for lack of a better term, absence of meaning. Where it hid, there were no trees; where it crept closer, there was no grass; through the arc it leapt at me, there was no breeze of motion. There was no air at all.\n\nAs it struck, I felt the distinct sensation of claws puncturing me somewhere unseen; somewhere I'd never felt before. My hands and arms and legs and torso seemed fine and I wasn't bleeding, but I knew I'd been injured somehow. As I fearfully ran back home, I could tell that I was less. I was vaguely tired, and it was hard to focus at times.\n\nThe solution at that early stage was easy: a big cup of coffee helped me feel normal again.\n\nFor a while, that subtle drain on my spirit became lost in the ebb and flow of caffeine in my system. You could say my life began that week, actually, because that was when I met Mar. She and I got along great, though, to be honest, I'm pretty sure I fell in love with her over the phone before we even met.\n\nIt was almost as if the strong emotions of that first week made the entity fight back\u2014it was still with me, latched on to some invisible part of my being.\n\nThe first few incidents were minor, and I hardly worried about them. The color of a neighbor's car changed from dark blue to black one morning, and I stared at it before shaking my head and shrugging off the difference. Two days later, at work, a coworker's name changed from Fred to Dan. I carefully asked around, but everyone said his name had always been Dan. I figured I'd just been mistaken.\n\nThen, as ridiculous as this sounds, I was peeing in my bathroom at home when I suddenly found myself on a random street. I was still in my pajamas, pants down, and urinating\u2014but now in full view of a dozen people at a bus stop. Horrified, I pulled up my clothes and ran before someone called the cops. I did manage to get home, but the experience forced me to admit that I was still in danger. The entity was doing something to me, and I didn't understand how to fight back.\n\nMar showed up that evening, but she had her own key.\n\n\"Hey,\" I asked her with confusion. \"How'd you get a key?\"\n\nShe just laughed. \"You're cute. Are you sure you're okay with this?\" She opened a door and entered a room full of boxes. \"I know living together is a big step, especially when we've only been dating three months.\"\n\nLiving together? I'd literally just met her the week before. Thing was, my mother had always called me a smart cookie for a reason. I knew when to shut my yap. Instead of causing a scene, I told her everything was fine\u2014and then I went straight to my room and began investigating.\n\nMy things were just as I had left them with no sign of a three month gap in habitation, but I did find something out of the ordinary: the date. I shivered angrily as I processed the truth.\n\nThe entity had eaten three months of my life.\n\nWhat the hell was I facing? What kind of creature could consume pieces of one's soul like that? I'd missed the most exciting part of a new relationship, and I would never understand any shared stories or in-jokes from that period. Something absurdly precious had been taken from me, and I was furious.\n\nThat fury helped suppress the entity. I never imbibed alcohol. I drank coffee religiously. I checked the date every time I woke up. For three years, I managed to live each day while observing nothing more than minor alterations. A social fact here and there\u2014someone's job, how many kids they had, that sort of thing\u2014the layout of nearby streets, the time my favorite television show aired, that kind of thing. Always, those changes reminded me the creature still had its claws sunk into my spirit. Not once in three years did I ever let myself zone out.\n\nOne day, I grew careless. I let myself get really into the season finale of my favorite show. It was gripping; a fantastic story. Right at the height of the action, a young boy came up to my lounger and shook my arm.\n\nSurprised, I asked, \"Who are you? How did you get in here?\"\n\nHe laughed and smiled brightly. \"Silly Daddy!\"\n\nMy heart sank in my chest. I knew immediately what had happened. After a few masked questions, I discovered that he was two years old\u2014and that he was my son.\n\nThe agony and heartache filling my chest was nearly unbearable. Not only had I missed the birth of my son, I would never see or know the first years of his life. Mar and I had obviously gotten married and started a family in the time I'd lost, and I had no idea what joys or pains those years contained.\n\nIt was snowing outside. Holding my sudden son in my lap, I sat and watched the flakes fall outside. What kind of life was this going to be if slips in concentration could cost me years? I had to get help.\n\nThe church had no idea what to do. The priests didn't believe me, and told me I had a health issue rather than some sort of possession.\n\nThe doctors didn't have any clue. Nothing showed up on all their scans and tests, but they happily took my money in return for nothing.\n\nBy the time I ran out of options, I'd decided to tell Mar. There was no way to know what this all looked like from her side. What was I like when I wasn't there? Did I still take our son to school? Did I still do my job? Clearly, I did, because she seemed to be none the wiser, but I still had a horrible feeling that something must have been missing in her life when I wasn't actually home inside my own head.\n\nBut the night I set up a nice dinner in preparation, she arrived not by unlocking the front door, but by knocking on it. I answered, and found that she was in a nice dress.\n\nShe was happily surprised by the settings on the table. \"A fancy dinner for a second date? I knew you were sweet on me!\"\n\nThank the Lord I knew when to keep my mouth shut. If I'd gone on about being married and having a son, she might have run for the hills. Instead, I took her coat and sat down for our second date.\n\nThrough carefully crafted questions, I managed to deduce the truth. This really was our second date. She saw relief and happiness in me, but interpreted that as dating jitters. I was just excited to realize that the entity wasn't necessarily eating whole portions of my life. The symptoms, as I was beginning to understand them, were more like the consequences of a shattered soul. The creature had wounded me; broken me into pieces. Perhaps I was to live my life out of order, but at least I would actually get to live it. \n\nAnd so it went for a few years\u2014from my perspective. While minor changes in politics or geography would happen daily, major shifts in my mental location only happened every couple months. When I found myself in a new place and time in my life, I just shut up and listened, making sure to get the lay of the land before doing anything to avoid making mistakes. On the farthest-flung leap yet, I met my six-year-old grandson, and I asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up. He said, \"Writer.\" I told him that was a fine idea.\n\nThen, I was back in month two of my relationship with Mar, and I had the best night with her on the riverfront. When I say the best, I mean *the best*. Knowing how special she would become to me, I asked her to move in. I got to live through what I'd missed the first go-around, and I came to understand that I was never mentally absent. I would always be there\u2014eventually. When we were moving her boxes in, she stopped for a moment and said she marveled at my great love, as if I'd known her for a lifetime and never once doubted she was the one.\n\nThat was the first time I'd truly laughed freely and wholeheartedly since the entity had wounded me. She was right about my love for her, but for exactly the reason she'd considered a silly romantic analogy. I *had* known her my whole life, and I'd come to terms with my situation and found peace with it. It wasn't so bad to have sneak peeks at all the best parts ahead.\n\nBut of course I wouldn't be writing this if it hadn't gotten worse. The entity was still with me. It had not wounded me and departed like I'd wanted to believe. The closest I can describe my growing understanding was that the creature was burrowing deeper into my psyche, fracturing it into smaller pieces. Instead of months between major shifts, I began having only weeks. Once I noticed that trend, I feared my ultimate fate would be to jump between times in my life heartbeat by heartbeat, forever confused, forever lost. Only an instant in each time meant I would never be able to speak with anyone else, never be able to hold a conversation, never express or receive love.\n\nAs the true depth of that fear came upon me, I sat in an older version of me and watched the snow falling outside. That was the one constant in my life: the weather didn't care who I was or what pains I had to face. Nature was always there. The falling snow was always like a little hook that kept me in a place; the pure emotional peace it brought was like a panacea on my mental wounds, and I'd never yet shifted while watching the pattern of falling white and thinking of the times I'd gone sledding or built a snow fort as a child.\n\nA teenager touched my arm. \"Grandpa?\"\n\n\"Eh?\" He'd startled me out of my thoughts, so I was less careful than usual. \"Who are you?\"\n\nHe half-grinned, as if not sure whether I was joking. Handing me a stack of papers, he said, \"It's my first attempt at a novel. Would you read it and tell me what you think?\"\n\nAhh, of course. \"Pursuing that dream of being a writer, I see.\"\n\nHe burned bright red. \"Trying to, anyway.\"\n\n\"All right. Run off, I'll read this right now.\" The words were blurry, and, annoyed, I looked for glasses I probably had for reading. Being old was *terrible*, and I wanted to leap back into a younger year\u2014but not before I read his book. I found my glasses in a sweater pocket, and began leafing through. Mar puttered in and out of the living room, still beautiful, but I had to focus. I didn't know how much time I would have there.\n\nIt seemed that we had relatives over. Was it Christmas? A pair of adults and a couple kids I didn't recognize tromped through the hallway, and I saw my son, now adult, walk by with his wife on the way out the door. As a group, the extended family began sledding outside.\n\nFinally, I finished reading the story, and I called out for my grandson. He rushed down the stairs and into the living room. \"How was it?\"\n\n\"Well, it's terrible,\" I told him truthfully. \"But it's terrible for all the right reasons. You're still a young man, so your characters behave like young people, but the structure of the story itself is very solid.\" I paused. \"I didn't expect it to turn out to be a horror story.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"It's a reflection of the times. Expectations for the future are dismal, not hopeful like they used to be.\"\n\n\"You're far too young to be aware like that,\" I told him. An idea occurred to me. \"If you're into horror, do you know anything about strange creatures?\"\n\n\"Sure. I read everything I can. I love it.\"\n\nWarily, I scanned the entrances to the living room. Everyone was busy outside. For the first time, I opened up to someone in my life about what I was experiencing. In hushed tones, I told him about my fragmented consciousness.\n\nFor a teenager, he took it well. \"You're serious?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe donned the determined look of a grown man accepting a quest. \"I'll look into it, see what I can find out. You should start writing down everything you experience. Build some data. Maybe we can map your psychic wound.\"\n\nWow. \"Sounds like a plan.\" I was surprised. That made sense, and I hadn't expected him to have a serious response. \"But how will I get all the notes in one place?\"\n\n\"Let's come up with somewhere for you to leave them,\" he said, frowning with thought. \"Then I'll get them, and we can trace the path you're taking through your own life, see if there's a pattern.\"\n\nFor the first time since the situation had gotten worse, I felt hope again. \"How about under the stairs? Nobody ever goes under there.\"\n\n\"Sure.\" He turned and left the living room.\n\nI peered after him. I heard him banging around near the stairs.\n\nFinally, he returned with a box, laid it on the carpet, and opened it to reveal a bursting stack of papers. He exclaimed, \"Holy crap!\"\u2014but of course, being a teenager, he didn't really say *crap*.\n\nTaken aback, I blinked rapidly, forgiving his cussing because of the shock. \"Did I write those?\"\n\nHe looked up at me with wonder. \"Yeah. Or, you will. You still have to write them and put them under the stairs after this.\" He gazed back down at the papers\u2014then covered the box. \"So you probably shouldn't see what they say. That could get weird.\"\n\nThat much I understood. \"Right.\"\n\nHe gulped. \"There are like fifty boxes under there, all filled up like this. Deciphering these will take a very long time.\" His tone dropped to deadly seriousness. \"But I will save you, grandpa. Because I don't think anyone else can.\" \n\nTears flowed down my cheeks then, and I couldn't help but sob once or twice. I hadn't realized how lonely I'd become in my shifting prison of awareness until I finally had someone who understood. \"Thank you. Thank you so much.\"\n\nAnd then I was young again, and at work on a random Tuesday. Once the sadness and relief faded, anger and determination replaced them. After I finished my work, I grabbed some paper and began writing. While the weeks shifted around me, while those weeks became days, and then hours, I wrote every single spare moment about when and where I thought I was. I put them under the stairs out of order; my first box was actually the thirtieth, and my last box was the first. Once I had over fifty boxes written from my perspective\u2014and once my shifting became a matter of minutes\u2014I knew it was up to my grandson to take it from there.\n\nI put my head down and stopped looking. I couldn't stand the river of changing awareness any longer. Names and places and dates and jobs and colors and people were all wrong and different.\n\nI'd never been older. I sat watching the snow fall. A man of at least thirty that I vaguely recognized entered the room. \"Come on, I think I finally figured it out.\"\n\nI was so frail that moving was painful. \"Are you him? Are you my grandson?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" He took me to a room filled with strange equipment and sat me in a rubber chair facing a large mirror twice the height of a man. \"The pattern finally revealed itself.\"\n\n\"How long have you worked on this?\" I asked him, aghast. \"Tell me you didn't miss your life like I'm missing mine!\"\n\nHis expression was both stone cold and furiously resolute. \"It'll be worth it.\" He brought two thin metal rods close to my arm and then nodded at the mirror. \"Look. This shock is carefully calibrated.\"\n\nThe electric zap from his device was startling, but not painful. In the mirror, I saw a rapid arcing light-silhouette appear above my head and shoulder. The electricity moved through the creature like a wave, briefly revealing the terrible nature of what was happening to me. A bulging leech-like mouth was wrapped around the back of my head, coming down to my eyebrows and touching each ear, and its slug-like body ran over my shoulder and into my very soul.\n\nIt was a parasite.\n\nAnd it was feeding on my mind.\n\nMy now-adult grandson held my hand as I took in the horror. After a moment, he asked, \"Removing it is going to hurt very badly. Are you up for this?\"\n\nFearful, I asked, \"Is Mar here?\"\n\nHis face softened. \"No. Not for a few years now.\"\n\nI could tell from his reaction what had happened, but I didn't want it to be true. \"How?\"\n\n\"We have this conversation a lot,\" he responded. \"Are you sure you want to know? It never makes you feel better.\"\n\nTears brimmed in my eyes. \"Then I don't care if it hurts, or if I die. I don't want to stay in a time where she's not alive.\"\n\nHe made a sympathetic noise of understanding and then returned to his machines to hook several wires, diodes, and other bits of technology to my limbs and forehead. While he did so, he talked. \"I've worked for two decades to figure this out, and I've had a ton of help from other researchers of the occult. This parasite doesn't technically exist in our plane. It's one of the lesser spawns of \u00b5\u00ac\u00df\u00b5, and it feeds on the plexus of mind, soul, and quantum consciousness\/reality. When details like names and colors of objects changed, you weren't going crazy. The web of your existence was merely losing strands as the creature ate its way through you.\"\n\nI didn't fully understand. I looked up in confusion as he placed a circlet of electronics like a crown on my head in exact line with where the parasite's mouth had ringed me. \"What's \u00b5\u00ac\u00df\u00b5?\"\n\nHe paused his work and grew pale. \"I forgot that you wouldn't know. You're lucky, believe me.\" After a deep breath, he began moving again, and placed his fingers near a few switches. \"Ready? This is carefully tuned to make your nervous system extremely unappetizing to the parasite, but it's basically electro-shock therapy.\"\n\nI could still see Mar's smile. Even though she was dead, I'd just been with her moments ago. \"Do it.\"\n\nThe click of a switch echoed in my ears, and I almost laughed at how mild the electricity was. It didn't feel like anything\u2014at least at first. Then, I saw the mirror shaking, and my body within that image convulsing. Oh. No. It did hurt. Nothing had ever been more painful. It was just so excruciating that my mind hadn't been able to immediately process it. \n\nAs my vision shook and fire burned in every nerve in my body, I could see the reflected trembling light-silhouette of the parasite on my head as it writhed in agony equal to mine. It had claws\u2014six clawed lizard-like limbs under its leech-like body\u2014and it cut into me in an attempt to stay latched on.\n\nThe electricity made my memories flare.\n\nMar's smile was foremost, lit brightly in front of a warm fire as the snow fell past the window behind her. The edges of that memory began lighting up, and I realized that my life *was* one continuous stretch of experience\u2014it was only the awareness of it that had been fragmented by that feasting evil on my back.\n\nI'd never managed to be there for the birth of my son. I'd jumped around it a dozen times, but never actually lived it. For the first time, I got to hold Mar's hand and be there for her.\n\nNo. *No!* That moment had shifted seamlessly into holding her hand as she lay in a hospital bed for a very different reason. Not this! God, why? It was so merciless to make me remember this. I broke down in tears as nurses rushed into the room. I didn't want to know. I didn't want to experience it. I'd seen all the good parts, but I hadn't wanted the worst part\u2014the inevitable end that all would one day face.\n\nIt wasn't worth it. It was tainted. All that joy was given back ten thousand fold as pain.\n\nThe fire in my body and in my brain surged to sheer white torture, and I screamed.\n\nMy scream faded into a surprised shout as the machines and electricity and chair faded away. Snow was no longer falling around my life; I was out in the woods on a bright summer day.\n\nOh God.\n\nI turned to see the creature approaching me. It was the same absence of meaning; the same blank on reality. It crept forward, just like before\u2014but, this time, it hissed and turned away. I stood, astounded at being young again and freed from the parasite. My grandson had actually done it! He'd made me an unappetizing meal, so the predator of mind and soul had moved on in search of a different snack.\n\nI returned home in a daze.\n\nAnd while I was sitting there processing all that had happened, the phone rang. I looked at it in awe and sadness. I knew who it was. It was Marjorie, calling for the first time for some trivial reason she'd admit thirty years later was made up just to talk to me.\n\nBut all I could see was her lying in that hospital bed dying. It was going to end in unspeakable pain and loneliness. I would become an old man, left to sit by myself in an empty house, his soulmate gone long before him. At the end of it all, the only thing I would have left: sitting and watching the falling snow.\n\nBut now, thanks to my grandson, I would also have my memories. It would be a wild ride, no matter how it ended.\n\nOn a sudden impulse, I picked up the phone. With a smile, I asked, \"Hey, who's this?\"\n\nEven though I already knew.\n\n---\n\nAuthor's note: Together, my grandfather and I did set out to write the tale of his life. Unfortunately, his Alzheimer's disease progressed rapidly, and we were never able to finish. He's still alive, but I imagine that, mentally, he is in a better place than the nursing home. I like to think he's back in his younger days, living life and being happy, because the reality is much colder. It's snowing today; he loves the snow. When I visited him, he didn't recognize me, but he did smile as he sat looking out the window.\n\n---\n\n[Blog](http:\/\/mattdymerski.com\/) [FB](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MattDymerskiAuthor\/) [Tw](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MattDymerski)[.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/cLqsc)"},"205":{"title":"My job is watching a woman trapped in a room.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/brco33\/my_job_is_watching_a_woman_trapped_in_a_room\/","flair":"Series","author":"Verastahl","selftext":"Three years ago I was looking at the local job classifieds online when one of the ads caught my eye, not because of what it said, but because it said so little.  Best I remember, the ad just read \u201cJob available.  Good pay.  No benefits.  Discretion required.\u201d  It then listed an email address and that was all.  At the time I was managing a music store, but I had already started hearing rumors we would be shutting down within the next year and the likelihood of a transfer to another store was slim. I had been morosely looking at job listings for the last few days, but this was the first one that stood out, if only because I was bored and it was weird.\n\nSo I sent an email.\n\nHalf an hour later I had a response, telling me to go to a particular office building in an upscale part of the city at a precise time for my \u201cscreening\u201d.  I went, and after waiting for a few minutes in the lobby, I was taken into an office where I was given a series of forms and questionnaires to fill out.  They collected them and told me they would be in touch.\n\nI had almost forgotten about the whole thing until a month later I got a call saying I had moved on to the second stage of the hiring process.  I was again given an address and time, and when I arrived (this time it was a different nice office park twenty miles away from the first one), I was met by a man who introduced himself as Mr. Solomon.  He escorted me into a large room that contained a chair and a desk.  On the desk were two large monitors, a keyboard and mouse, and a bolted down metal box with two oversized buttons on it:  One red and one green.\n\nHe told me this room was a model for the place I would be working if I took the job.  He described the job as follows.\n\nI would be working seven shifts of six hours every week.  My job would be simple.  I would arrive at work ten minutes early and enter an outer area that was like a locker room.  I would have my own personal locker.  I would store all belongings in the locker and change into the provided work clothes.  I was never, under any circumstances, to carry any item of my own into the surveillance room.  I was never, under any circumstances, to take any item with me from the surveillance room.\n\nAs for what I was to do in the surveillance room, I was told that the monitor on the left would constantly show a live stream from a high-definition camera in a remote location.  My job was simply to watch the camera.  Once an hour I would get onto the computer attached to the right monitor and enter a brief log describing anything interesting that occurred in the last hour.  I would have no pens or pencils or paper, and I should never try to take any kind of written notes about the work.\n\nAs for the red and green buttons, the red button was only to be used if there was an emergency.  This meant something on the video or in my workspace that required outside help.  The green button was to be hit if I saw something on the video feed that was particularly noteworthy.  It would tell other people somewhere that, at least in my opinion, something interesting was going on.  Solomon stressed that while I was given discretion on when to use this button, I should err on the side of only using it if and when something \u201cof real significance\u201d occurred.\n\nHe pointed out the camera on the ceiling of the room we were in.  He said the real room would be the same.  My work would be observed, and other people were watching the room on the video feed as well.  He said I was only a redundancy in case other systems failed.  He then smirked and asked if I knew what he meant by redundancy.\n\nI nodded, trying not to show my irritation.  I don\u2019t talk that good to people, so sometimes they think I\u2019m dumb.  That\u2019s okay.  Let him think that if he paid me good enough.\n\nThe pay was very good.  Thirty-five dollars an hour.  \n\nThis worried me.  I was already thinking this was some kind of psych experiment or secret government job, which I was okay with.  But that kind of money to sit and watch a screen?  My mom always told me that if something seems too good to be true, it probably is, and this was seeming too good to be true.\n\nI asked if I was going to be doing anything illegal.  Solomon laughed and said no.  I asked if anyone was going to get hurt.  Again, he shook his head no.  He said the reason they were paying so much was because they needed employees that were motivated to be professional and discrete.  The work they were doing was important, and for various reasons it couldn\u2019t be discussed.  If I took the job, I would have to sign papers promising I would never discuss my work there or I could be sued or locked up.  I\u2019m only breaking that now because of everything that\u2019s happened.\n\nSo I took the job, and because they wanted me to start right away, I had to quit the store with no notice.  I felt bad about that, but I was excited about the new job too.  It was a lot of money and seemed like easy enough work, if a bit boring.  I was nervous that there was something more to it, but I told myself I would just have to see.  No point in chickening out and wasting a good chance because I let my imagination go crazy.\nI was given the location of the job itself, and when I went there, I was amazed that it really was just like the model room I had been shown with only a few differences.  There was a locker room you had to pass through to enter the surveillance room and there was a small bathroom attached to the real surveillance room also.  The real room had a small water cooler in the corner, but because I wasn\u2019t allowed to bring anything in with me, I had to eat before or after every shift.  The biggest difference, of course, was that the monitors were turned on.\n\nThe right monitor was just a black and white terminal like you see in movies some times.  I could type in my logs, but no internet to look at or anything like that.  The left monitor\u2026\n\nIt was video from a room.  You would call it a bedroom I guess, because it had a bed in it, but it had lots of other stuff too.  A T.V., a sofa and chairs, a couple of tables, and plenty of empty space in between.  The camera must be high up in a corner, because I could see pretty much everything except for the far sides of furniture.  At first though, I didn\u2019t notice any of that stuff.  \n\nAll I saw was her.\n\nShe looked to be a little older than me and was very pretty.  When I first saw her, she was laying on her side on the sofa.  That was the part of the room farthest from the camera, but the picture was very clear and I could tell that she was sleeping.  I found myself leaning into the monitor more so I could see her better, and then I thought about what I was doing and felt embarrassed.  It\u2019s like I was spying on her.  A Peeping Tom, my mom used to call it.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to be a Peeping Tom, but I didn\u2019t want to be silly either.  I needed to think about it slow.  \n\nIt was a good job.  And I wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong, right?  I wasn\u2019t hurting anybody.  The woman looked fine.  And the room was nice.  She probably agreed to be there and it\u2019s all some experiment or something.  I was just overreacting.\n\nSo I sat down in the chair and began my work.\n\n**** \n\nIt didn\u2019t take long before I understood more.  The woman, I took to calling her Rachel, wasn\u2019t there of her free will.  I never saw her hurt, but it was clear that she never left that room except to go into what I think is a bathroom area that my camera couldn\u2019t see.  Well, she never left the room on her own.  Periodically, usually a couple of times a week during my shifts, men and women in strange-looking outfits would come in and take her from the room.  Sometimes she would struggle, but usually she would just go along with her head hung low.\n\nThey would always bring her back, though the times when she wasn\u2019t brought back during my shift were always the worst for me.  I would worry about her until I got to work the next day and saw her in the room watching T.V. or painting.  She never looked hurt or even that upset except for when they took her, and even when she fought, they were always gentle with her.  \n\nStill, I knew something was wrong.  I considered quitting the job, or hitting the red button and getting someone to come so I could get some answers.  Or calling the police and showing them what the camera was showing me.\n\nExcept I was scared.  Scared of losing my job,  and scared of what these people might do to me if I quit or told on them.  Solomon had told me when I took the job that part of being discreet was not asking questions.  I would never be asked to do more than I had already been told, but I could never tell anyone what I did or saw, and I could never ask questions about what I was doing or why.\n\nSo I made excuses.  It was all an experiment.  She was crazy or sick and they were trying to help her.  She was doing a job just like I was.  Or if she really was a prisoner somewhere, at least I was watching to make sure that she was okay.  If they ever tried to hurt her, or I saw that she really didn\u2019t want to be there for sure, I could get help then.  In a way, I told myself, I was helping to protect her by watching.\n\nI don\u2019t expect you to think much of my excuses.  I don\u2019t think much of them myself, especially now.  But in my defense, when things changed, I didn\u2019t ignore it or try to explain it away.  I knew something had to be done.\n\n****\n\nRachel would usually paint for an hour or two every day, and it seemed to always be during my afternoon shifts.  The room had no windows as far as I could tell, but I guess she either used a clock or her own body\u2019s time to keep to a kind of schedule.  I always liked to watch her paint\u2014the thing she was painting was always facing the wrong way for me to see it, but I could see her face as she worked.  She always looked peaceful and happy when she was painting, and seeing her that way, smiling serenely from time to time as she got something the way she wanted it, always made my day.\n\nI first noticed something was wrong when she started painting more frequently a few weeks ago.  Her expression was more focused and serious, and there was a tension to her movements that I wasn\u2019t used to seeing.  At first I thought she was just really trying to work hard on something, and I wanted to tell her not to worry.  Every few weeks the others would come in and take the old paintings out anyway, bringing in a new stack of\u2026I think the word is canvas.\n\nBut it was more than her being focused.  Something was wrong.  She didn\u2019t look happy and she was going for hours at a time.  In the span of three days, she had finished four paintings.\n\nI had been growing more and more worried watching her work, and when she finished the fourth, I found myself telling her to just stop and rest awhile.  I had grown accustomed to talking to the monitor, talking to *her* in my own way.  But she didn\u2019t stop.  Instead she began moving the paintings.  Arranging them on the back and seat of the long sofa at the far end of the room.  \n\nThis was the first time I had gotten to see any of the paintings.  Even when the others were taking them out, they always seemed to be turned away from the camera.  I was still worried about her, but I was also happy to finally see something she had worked on.  Happy and amazed.\n\nThey were beautiful.  One was a beautiful green forest.  Another was an old stone well.  A third was a house sitting alone on a small island.  The last was an old-fashioned looking movie theater.  All of them looked like something out of a dream, with trailing lines of color mixing in the air around them like leaves caught in a wind.  It was only when I looked close that I realized the lines of color weren\u2019t random.  They were words.  Easy to miss if you weren\u2019t looking close, and by themselves, they didn\u2019t seem to mean much.  Just the ghost of a word somewhere in each of the paintings, easy to lose in everything else that was being shown.\n\nI leaned into the monitor and squinted, trying to read the words.  Then my heart started thudding as I made them out.  Blinking and rubbing my eyes, I looked again, reading them out loud in order\u2014left to right, top pair then bottom.\n\n\u201cPlease.\u201d\n\n\u201cHelp.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe.\u201d\n\n\u201cThomas.\u201d\n\nI pushed back from the monitor, my hand over my mouth.  I didn\u2019t know what to do.  I didn\u2019t know how any of this could be happening.  It wasn\u2019t just that she was asking for help, though that was a big part of it.  \n\n[It was that *my* name is Thomas.](https:\/\/redd.it\/9ndww5)\n\n****\n\n[Part Two](https:\/\/redd.it\/brsj8v)"},"206":{"title":"I'm a Search and Rescue Officer for the US Forest Service, I have some stories to tell","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3iex1h\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/","flair":null,"author":"searchandrescuewoods","selftext":"I wasn't sure where else to post these stories, so I figured I'd share them here. I've been an SAR officer for a few years now, and along the way I've seen some things that I think you guys will be interested in. \n\n* I have a pretty good track record for finding missing people. Most of the time they just wander off the path, or slip down a small cliff, and they can't find their way back. The majority of them have heard the old 'stay where you are' thing, and they don't wander far. But I've had two cases where that didn't happen. Both bother me a lot, and I use them as motivation to search even harder on the missing persons cases I get called on. \nThe first was a little boy who was out berry-picking with his parents. He and his sister were together, and both of them went missing around the same time. Their parents lost sight of them for a few seconds, and in that time both the kids apparently wandered off. When their parents couldn't find them, they called us, and we came out to search the area. We found the daughter pretty quickly, and when we asked where her brother was, she told us that he'd been taken away by 'the bear man.' She said he gave her berries and told her to stay quiet, that he wanted to play with her brother for a while. The last she saw of her brother, he was riding on the shoulders of 'the bear man' and seemed calm. Of course, our first thought was abduction, but we never found a trace of another human being in that area. The little girl was also insistent that he wasn't a normal man, but that he was tall and covered in hair, 'like a bear', and that he had a 'weird face.' We searched that area for *weeks*, it was one of the longest calls I've ever been on, but we never found a single trace of that kid. \nThe other was a young woman who was out hiking with her mom and grandpa. According to the mother, her daughter had climbed up a tree to get a better view of the forest, and she'd never come back down. They waited at the base of the tree for hours, calling her name, before they called for help. Again, we searched everywhere, and we never found a trace of her. I have no idea where she could possibly have gone, because neither her mother or grandpa saw her come down.\n\n* A few times, I've been out on my own searching with a canine, and they've tried to lead me straight up cliffs. Not hills, not even rock faces. Straight, sheer cliffs with no possible handholds. It's always baffling, and in those cases we usually find the person on the other side of the cliff, or miles away from where the canine has led us. I'm sure there's an explanation, but it's sort of strange.\n\n* One particularly sad case involved the recovery of a body. A nine-year-old girl fell down an embankment and got impaled on a dead tree at the base. It was a complete freak accident, but I'll never forget the sound her mother made when we told her what had happened. She saw the body bag being loaded into the ambulance, and she let out the most haunting, heart-broken wail I've ever heard. It was like her whole life was crashing down around her, and a part of her had died with her daughter. I heard from another SAR officer that she killed herself a few weeks after it happened. She couldn't live with the loss of her daughter.\n\n* I was teamed up with another SAR officer because we'd received reports of bears in the area. We were looking for a guy who hadn't come home from a climbing trip when he was supposed to, and we ended up having to do some serious climbing to get to where we figured he'd be. We found him trapped in a small crevasse with a broken leg. It was not pleasant. He'd been there for almost two days, and his leg was very obviously infected. We were able to get him into a chopper, and I heard from one of the EMTs that the guy was absolutely inconsolable. He kept talking about how he'd been doing fine, and when he'd gotten to the top, a man had been there. He said the guy had no climbing equipment, and he was wearing a parka and ski pants. He walked up to the guy, and when the guy turned around, he said he had no face. It was just blank. He freaked out, and ended up trying to get off the mountain too fast, which is why he'd fallen. He said he could hear the guy all night, climbing down the mountain and letting out these horrible muffled screams. That story bothered the hell out of me. I'm glad I wasn't there to hear it. \n\n* One of the scariest things I've ever had happen to me involved the search for a young woman who'd gotten separated from her hiking group. We were out until late at night, because the dogs had picked up her scent. When we found her, she was curled up under a large rotted log. She was missing her shoes and pack, and she was clearly in shock. She didn't have any injuries, and we were able to get her to walk with us back to base ops. Along the way, she kept looking behind us and asking us why 'that big man with black eyes' was following us. We couldn't see anyone, so we just wrote it off as some weird symptom of shock. But the closer we got to base, the more agitated this woman got. She kept asking me to tell him to stop 'making faces' at her. At one point she stopped and turned around and started yelling into the forest, saying that she wanted him to leave her alone. She wasn't going to go with him, she said, and she wouldn't give us to him. We finally got her to keep moving, but we started hearing these weird noises coming from all around us. It was almost like coughing, but more rhythmic and deeper. It was almost insect-like, I don't really know how else to describe it. When we were within site of base ops, the woman turns to me, and her eyes are about as wide as I can imagine a human could open them. She touches my shoulder and says 'He says to tell you to speed up. He doesn't like looking at the scar on your neck.' I have a very small scar on the base of my neck, but it's mostly hidden under my collar, and I have no idea how this woman saw it. Right after she says it, I hear that weird coughing right in my ear, and I just about jumped out of my skin. I hustled her to ops, trying not to show how freaked out I was, but I have to say I was really happy when we left the area that night.\n\n* This is the last one I'll tell, and it's probably the weirdest story I have. Now, I don't know if this is true in every SAR unit, but in mine, it's sort of an unspoken, regular thing we run into. You can try asking about it with other SAR officers, but even if they know what you're talking about, they probably won't say anything about it. We've been told not to talk about it by our superiors, and at this point we've all gotten so used to it that it doesn't even seem weird anymore.\nOn just about every case where we're really far into the wilderness, I'm talking 30 or 40 miles, at some point we'll find a staircase in the middle of the woods. It's almost like if you took the stairs in your house, cut them out, and put them in the forest. I asked about it the first time I saw some, and the other officer just told me not to worry about it, that it was normal. Everyone I asked said the same thing. I wanted to go check them out, but I was told, very emphatically, that I should never go near any of them. I just sort of ignore them now when I run into them because it happens so frequently. \n\nI have a lot more stories, and I suppose if anyone's interested, I'll tell some of them tomorrow. If anyone has any theories about the stairs, or if you've seen them too, let me know. \n\n**EDIT: Part 2 is up: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3ijnt6\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/**"},"207":{"title":"The previous tenant of my new flat left a survival guide.

We\u2019ve been together for 5 years now and we\u2019re old and wise enough to settle down and finally leave our parents houses. He just turned 24 and I\u2019m 22. He\u2019s the love of my life. His name is Jamie and I couldn\u2019t be happier to be living with him. \n\nWhen we decided to make the leap we spent 2 months looking at flats and houses, we couldn\u2019t afford to buy yet so renting was our only option but the prices were astronomical. For our budget we would have been lucky to get a box room and a stove.\n\nJamie works for a local 24 hour fast food restaurant and I\u2019m training to be a teacher. The early stages of training don\u2019t pay much and I owe a lot in student loans so finances are tough. \n\nWe had almost given up hope until we found our flat. It was nothing special, but to us it was a palace. A spacious 2 bedroom apartment with views of a city park, a balcony and local conveniences. It was in a tower block in a not so nice area, but neither of us had been wealthy growing up, we weren\u2019t fussy. Just grateful to be together. \n\nThe advert was sweetened by the deposit free option and open ended tenancy. The landlord was happy to sign a five year contract if we wanted. That sort of thing never happens in the city. We were told that along with no deposit we would also have no inspections, but would be liable to pay for any damage when we ended the tenancy. I\u2019d never heard of anything quite like it.\n\nWe knew that for our budget and location we weren\u2019t going to get any better. We snapped the place up fast, not even bothering to view it. It felt like our only chance. \n\nMove in day rolled around quickly and yesterday we got the keys to our first home together, it was such a strange feeling. The day was chaos, getting our stuff in and up in the lift. We were flat number 42, on the 7th floor. The items we couldn\u2019t get in the lift had to be taken up all the stairs by the removal men. I think they were grateful we weren\u2019t any higher but I still wish we had been able to give them a better tip. \n\nIn the evening we settled down on our second hand sofa, given to us by a cousin of a friend and watched some tv. We smoked cigarettes on the balcony looking at the park and fell asleep on our mattress on the floor super early because we had no energy to put the bed together yet and Jamie had work at a hideous time of the morning. \n\nWe slept soundly last night, I felt safe and happy. I don\u2019t think that feeling is coming back any time soon and it\u2019s all due to the note I found this morning. \n\nI found it in the kitchen, having a coffee, hours after Jamie had left for his early shift at work. It was in one of the cupboards that were fixed to the wall, there were a bunch of useful items from the previous tenant. Spare keys to the flat, a set of tiny keys that locked and unlocked the windows (necessary for those with kids this high up), spare smoke alarm batteries and a folded up piece of paper. \n\nThe note was handwritten with \u201cNew occupier of flat 42\u201d in beautiful cursive on the blank side. I opened it up and sat down to read. I can\u2019t really describe it to you, so I\u2019m going to copy it out below. \n\n*Dear New Occupier,*\n\n*Firstly, welcome to your new home. I lived here before you for 35 years with my husband. Unfortunately he had an incident at home recently that I\u2019d rather not discuss that claimed his life. My sister has now decided I can\u2019t keep up with the demands of the property and has insisted that I move in with her and her husband. I was reluctant at first, but the stairs do kill me at my age and without Bernie it\u2019s filled with sadness.*\n\n*Anyway. When you\u2019ve lived somewhere for as long as I have it feels like a person that you know. You understand it\u2019s personality and what makes it tick. I thought it was probably pertinent that I impart some of that knowledge on you.*\n\n*It\u2019s a wonderful home, honestly, I have lived through best and worst years and leaving it behind is very emotional but if you are to survive and get the best out of it then there are some steps you need to follow.*\n\n*1. The landlord will never bother you, he doesn\u2019t visit, call or communicate in any way. But make sure to pay your rent in a timely fashion always. I have only dealt with him once in 35 years and let\u2019s just say I never missed another rent day. Any repairs required you speak to the agent you rented the place with.*\n\n*2. DO NOT use the communal lift between 1.11 and 3.33 am. Just don\u2019t do it. This step is vital if you are to have a happy life here. It really is life or death. Don\u2019t do it. This has cost me and many others in the building greatly and I would rather not elaborate on why you shouldn\u2019t do this. Just please don\u2019t do it. I cannot stress this enough.*\n\n*3. When you hear the strange animal noises coming from flat 48 don\u2019t question it, Mr Prentice lives there and he\u2019s a lovely chap. Don\u2019t be afraid to say hello to him in the corridor or on the stairs (he\u2019s old school, so he never risks the lift) but whatever you do, don\u2019t check on him when you hear the noises. You\u2019ll know when you hear them.*\n\n*4. If you ever come across a window cleaner on the balcony ignore him. He may seem like the nicest fellow you\u2019ve ever had trying to sell you something at the door but it really is best that you don\u2019t engage. He will go away if you ignore him. But he tries pretty hard the first few times so you\u2019ll need some resilience. Whatever you do, don\u2019t offer him anything. No money, no hot drink.*\n\n*5. Don\u2019t leave food scraps out. Bin or refrigerate them immediately. If you have small animals, it is imperative that you watch them eat and take away any leftover food immediately after they are done. This and rule 2 go hand in hand, the things forage all day and seem to really love animal feed. You don\u2019t want them in your flat. I promise. You can leave what you want out between 1.11 and 3.33am so you may want to feed your pets then.*\n\n*6. Don\u2019t communicate with any neighbours who claim to come from flats 65-72. These flats suffered a fire in the late 80s that devastated the whole floor, all the residents died in their homes. The building was mostly council owned at the time and they never bothered to renovate the flats. They\u2019ve been empty ever since but every now and again someone will knock at your door claiming to live in one of these flats and ask to borrow some sugar. They will seem entirely average but you must shut and lock the door immediately. I installed two extra security bolts to avoid these fuckers. I don\u2019t like to swear at my age but they really are fuckers.*\n\n*7. Simple one for you here, keep a weapon in each room. Sometimes you follow all these steps and something still slips through the net. Better to be safe than sorry.*\n\n*8. The building has a committee that will try and get you to join. It\u2019s one of those neighbours groups about improving living conditions for all residents. It\u2019s a nice group and the lady who runs it - Terri from flat 26- is a fantastic neighbour. By all means get involved. But I wouldn\u2019t recommend babysitting Terri\u2019s 2 children. She\u2019ll ask you, because the poor woman needs a break, but if you accept don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.*\n\n*9. Stray hairless cats sometimes roam in the hallway. I know they\u2019re supposedly a special, expensive breed, but they don\u2019t belong to anyone. They\u2019re mostly  harmless, but don\u2019t pick them up. Not unless you see one of those neighbours that claims to live in 65-72. Then grab the cat and lock it inside with you. It\u2019ll burn your skin a little but the cats are friendly and I wouldn\u2019t want to see them hurt.*\n\n*10. There is no way to fix the damp patch on the ceiling in the bedroom. Sometimes it will turn a deep crimson and look quite concerning, but please try not to be alarmed, it doesn\u2019t drip, it doesn\u2019t get any bigger and it\u2019s been there longer than I have. The landlord won\u2019t budge on it, according the the agents. I flagged it many times, even called the police the first night it changed colour, but it was a waste of time and it will be for you too. It\u2019s best to ignore it.*\n\n*11. You can trust the postman. His name is Ian Flanders and he\u2019s been the postman since before I moved in. He has his own key to the main door and delivers post to the door every morning at 8.54. I can\u2019t include everything here, or it would become a novel but if you have any questions Ian will help you.*\n\n*12. Finally, the first few weeks are the worst. You\u2019ll feel like you\u2019ve made a mistake, I\u2019m sure reading this you already do, but if you can get through the first few weeks it really is a lovely block to live in. Every property has it quirks and this one is a little extra special, but you can be truly happy here if you just take my advice. I wish you all the best, I really do.*\n\n*Yours truly*, \n\n*Mrs Prudence Hemmings*\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to think after reading the note. Hopefully it was some sort of joke but the agent had said the previous tenant was an elderly lady and I can\u2019t see anyone named Prudence Hemmings attempting to play practical jokes on someone they\u2019d never met. \n\nThere were also parts of the note I couldn\u2019t disprove, there was indeed a large damp patch above the bed that me and Jamie had already discussed reporting. No crimson but it definitely existed. I had also commented on a beautiful Sphynx cat roaming the halls as we were moving in. I started to get seriously freaked out.\n\nOur dream, our beautiful little home had just become a source of fear and confusion. I checked the time and it was 9.14. Damn it. Out of time to catch postman Ian. When I opened the door to check, sure enough, two letters addressed to a Mrs Hemmings sat on the doorstep. \n\nAt about 11.15 my worst fears were truly confirmed when a friendly middle aged looking man carrying window cleaning equipment knocked on my balcony door. I ignored him. I didn\u2019t want to take the risk until I\u2019d spoken to Jamie and showed him the note. I\u2019d texted him already to rush home. I felt bad as the man rapped his knuckles against the door for over 10 minutes, but honestly the longer it went on the more I was terrified. \n\nMy windows were sparkling, and due to our lack of curtains I couldn\u2019t even hide from his gaze. I felt so exposed. He stayed for a total of 30 minutes exactly and never once did he stop looking at me or knocking. He shouted the occasional ultra friendly line or humble request for a beverage in the heat through the door but I did my best to avoid eye contact. \n\nWhen he finally left I looked outside every window in the flat, but I couldn\u2019t see him on any of the other balconies or see any equipment suggesting he was around. He had vanished completely. \n\nJamie still hadn\u2019t text me back, he must have been having a rough shift, it was a Friday and they were always busy. It wasn\u2019t often that he didn\u2019t reply. He was due home in around an hour anyway.\n\nI read the note probably hundreds of times over, I tortured myself reading it for the next hour. Desperately waiting for Jamie to come through the door to tell me it was all crazy and I should relax. \n\nI hoped for that so much.\n\nBut Jamie never came. His shift should have finished around midday but by 2pm he still wasn\u2019t home. I panicked, I cried, I left over 100 voice messages on his phone but got nowhere. I finally decided it had been long enough that calling his work wouldn\u2019t embarrass him and his boss told me that he had never turned up for his shift. \n\nI thought about it, what could have happened?  And then it hit me. Jamie\u2019s shift started at 4am today. He would have left the flat at 3.15 and taken the lift down the stairs. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ve tried to convince myself it was all just a big joke. Maybe Jamie wrote the note and got his boss in on it. A voice in my head kept telling me that he couldn\u2019t write like that if he tried but I had to attempt to fool myself. It\u2019s getting late and he still isn\u2019t home, what if it\u2019s all true?

Death by a headshot, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, is vastly better than the alternative.\n\nMy ordeal started over ten thousand years ago, at 10:15 this morning. I earn extra money by participating in drug trials. I\u2019m a so-called \u201chealthy subject\u201d who takes experimental drugs to help assess side effects. Once it was a kidney drug. A few times it\u2019s been something for blood pressure or cholesterol. This morning they told me the drug I took was a psychoactive substance intended to accelerate brain function.\n\nNone of the drugs I had tested so far have ever done anything for me, in the recreational sense. In other words, none of the drugs I\u2019ve tested have given me a killer buzz, or mellowed me out, or anything. Maybe I\u2019ve always ended up the placebo group, but nothing I\u2019ve tested had affected me at all.\n\nToday\u2019s drug was different. This shit *worked*. They gave me a pill at 10:15 and told me to hang out in the waiting room until they called me back for some tests. \u201cOnly about thirty minutes,\u201d the research assistant told me. I flopped onto the waiting room couch and read a few articles from a copy of Psychology Today that was sitting on the coffee table. They hadn\u2019t called me back when I finished the Psychology Today so I picked up a US News and read it cover-to-cover. Then I read an old Scientific American. *What was taking them so damn long*?\n\nI sluggishly turned my head to look at the wall clock. It was only 10:23 am. I had read all three magazines in eight minutes. I remember thinking this was going to be a long day. I was right.\n\nThe waiting room had little bookshelf with some used hardcovers on it. When I stood up to walk to the bookshelf it felt like my legs barely worked. It\u2019s not that they were weak. They were just slow. It took a full minute just to stand up off the couch, and another minute to take two steps to the bookcase.\n\nI scanned the old books on the shelf and picked out a copy of Moby Dick. My arms had the same problems as my legs. Just reaching one foot in front of me to grab the book took a long time. I actually got bored just waiting for my hand to reach the spine of the book.\n\nI slogged back to the couch and collapsed onto it in a slow-motion fall that reminded me of the low-gravity hops of astronauts on the moon. I opened Moby Dick (slowly) and began reading. I started with *Call me Ishmael* and got as far as Ahab throwing his pipe into the sea (which was all the way to friggin chapter *thirty*) before they called me back.\n\n\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d the research assistant asked me.\n\n\u201cI feel slow,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cActually, it\u2019s the other way around. Everything seems slow because you\u2019re so fast.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut my legs. My arms. They\u2019re moving in slow motion.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour body seems like it\u2019s moving slowly because your brain is fast. Your brain is running ten or twenty times faster than normal. You are thinking and perceiving reality at an accelerated pace. But your body is still constrained by the laws of biomechanics. Frankly, you\u2019re moving much faster than a normal person,\u201d she pantomimed a jogging motion. \u201cBut your brain is running so much faster right now, that even your fast walk seems very slow to you.\u201d\n\nI thought about my slow-motion flop onto the waiting room couch. Even if my muscles had slowed down, my body would still react to gravity the same way. But in the waiting room, I even *fell* in slow motion. Slow muscles couldn\u2019t explain why gravity seemed weaker. My brain was going at warp ten. That\u2019s how I managed to read three magazines and the first thirty chapters of Moby Dick in fifteen minutes.\n\nThey ran a series of tests on me. The physical tests were fun. They made me juggle three balls. Then four. Then six. I had no problem keeping six balls in the air because they seemed to be moving so slowly. It was boring, frankly, waiting for each ball to move through its arc so I could catch it (with my slow-motion hands) and toss it back into the air. They threw cheerios in the air and I caught them with chopsticks. They dropped a handful of coins and I counted the total value before they hit the ground.\n\nThe cognitive tests were less fun, but very illuminating. Finish a fifty-word word search (three seconds). Solve an intricate maze drawn onto a poster-sized paper (two seconds). View a slide show projected at ten images per second and answer detailed questions about what I saw (95% correct).\n\nThey told me I measured over 250 on the Knopf scale. Apparently, that\u2019s deep into the superhuman range of thinking speeds.\n\nThen they sent me home. \u201cIt\u2019ll wear off in a few hours,\u201d they said. \u201cWhich will seem like days to you. Try to use the residual effects to get some work done. Catch up on work emails while you\u2019re still in high-speed mode!\u201d\n\nThe ride home was *horrible*. It was only three metro stops, and in real-world time, it only took about thirty-five minutes. But in my drug-accelerated hyper-time, it felt like days. *Days*. Just walking out of the medical research suite to the elevator seemed like it took an hour. I sprinted out of the office, willing my legs to push me faster. But, the laws of biomechanics held me prisoner. As accelerated as my brain was, I couldn\u2019t do anything to make my legs work faster.\n\nThe huge disconnect between my body and mind made it extremely difficult to judge how and when to slow down, turn, or rotate my body. I had basically turned into giant, slow-motion spaz. I misjudged my speed and rammed into the wall by the elevator button at a pretty good speed. Even though I could see the wall coming at me, I couldn\u2019t make my finger, outstretched to hit the elevator button, move away fast enough and I jammed it against the wall. Hard. The pain was intense. If my brain had been running at regular speed, it probably only would have hurt for thirty seconds or so. But in my accelerated state, the intense pain seemed to last for half an hour. Forty-five minutes maybe.\n\nThe elevator ride was horrible. It felt like I spent four or five hours just descending seven floors, with nothing to look at but the interior of the elevator car.\n\nI sprinted to the metro station. I have to admit, this part was almost fun. Even though my body moved at, what seemed to me, super-slow speed, I could still carefully choose how and where to place my feet, swing my arms, and turn my torso. It only took a block or two to getting used to having a brain that ran two dozen times faster than my body. Then I basically sprint-danced the rest of the way, twisting and juking between people on the sidewalk and dodging moving cars with inches (a.k.a. minutes) of clearance.\n\nI spent an hour, in my time frame, descending into the subway and running to the platform. Endless tedium waiting the six minutes for the red-line train to arrive. Although there was more to look at on the metro platform than inside the elevator, it was still intensely boring. I should have stolen that copy of Moby Dick.\n\nThe red-line train roared into the station in slow-motion. The normally high-pitched squeal of its brakes was frequency shifted by my high-speed mind to a long low tone, like a monotone Tuba solo.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the squealing subway train that was three octaves lower than normal. All sound was slowed to the point of near inaudibility. Voices were gone, shifted below the threshold frequency of my hearing. I did manage to hear a screaming baby on my subway car \u2013 her shrieks slowed to sound like whale songs. Sharp sounds like a car horns and trucks bouncing over potholes were low, muddied roars like distant thunder.\n\nBack at the research offices, I could still hear and communicate with the research staff. But now verbal communication with anyone would be impossible. The effects of the drug were still intensifying.\n\nI spent what seemed like days on that fucking red-line train. Days. Listening to the whale-song of the screaming baby and the Tuba solo of the brakes. Where ordinary voices were frequency-shifted out of my audio range, smells didn\u2019t seem to be affected. I never became nose-blind to the body odor, the stench of the train\u2019s brakes, and m\u00e9lange of farts and other smells wafting through the metro car.\n\nI *finally* got back to my apartment. Sprinting through my open door and into the front hall at full speed was like a slow, relaxing drift down a lazy river.\n\nI was relieved to be home. At least I had stuff I could do there. I picked up the book I was reading \u2013 One Hundred Years of Solitude \u2013 and finished it. Despite turning the pages so quickly that I tore many of them, it seemed like most of the time I spent finishing the book was spent on page turning and not actually reading. Three minutes had passed since I got home.\n\nI tried surfing the Internet (my GOD it takes a long time for computers to boot these days) but it was too frustratingly slow. Hours (seemingly) to load each new page, and a fraction of a second to read it. A hundred articles in my news feed read and just three more minutes done.\n\nI dipped into my pile of yet-to-be-read books and finished two more. Four more minutes had passed.\n\nI decided to try to sleep off the remaining effects of the drug. Unfortunately, whatever part of my mind is responsible for perception, the part that\u2019s been accelerated to hyper speeds by the drug, isn\u2019t the same as the part that governs sleep. Despite being awake for what I perceived as days, my physical brain still thought it was 1:25 pm. It was not ready for sleep.\n\nNevertheless, I *tried* to sleep. I walked to my bedroom (a slow 45-minute drift through my apartment) and flung myself into bed (lazily falling like a feather onto the mattress). I closed my eyes and lay there for hours and hours (10 minutes of reality time) before giving up. Sleep would not come. I was facing what was going to feel like days, or maybe even weeks of being trapped in a slow-motion prison.\n\nSo I took an Ambien.\n\nThe sensation of the pill and the splash of water I used to swallow it sliding my throat was sickening. A lump that blocked my breathing, moving like a slug down my esophagus.\n\nI read a book. Ten minutes had passed. I read another. Eighteen minutes since I took the Ambien. I threw the book across the room in disgust at my situation. The book slowly pirouetted and spun through the air, like a leaf blowing in a breeze. It hit the wall with a long, faint rumble \u2013 the only sound I had head for what seemed like hours \u2013 then drifted to the floor like a flip-flop sinking in a swimming pool.\n\nThe force of gravity hadn\u2019t changed since I took the pill. The laws of physics were the same. It was just my perception of time that had gone wackadoo. This meant I could use the speed things seemed to fall as a way of judging the effects of the drug. Based on how long it took the book to drift to the floor, I estimated the effects of the drug were *still* intensifying.\n\nI read a magazine. I turned on the television \u2013 I clearly saw each frame of video like I was watching a slideshow. Frustrated, I turned the television off.\n\nI read some more. The first two books of *Churchill\u2019s A History of the English-Speaking Peoples*. Not exactly a light read. Frankly, I hated it. But given the hours of tedium it would take to go get another book off my bookshelf, just sitting on the couch and reading Churchill was better. Or at least less worse.\n\nIt had now been thirty-five minutes since I took the Ambien. I lay down on the couch and closed my eyes. Time passed. I inhaled \u2013 a hours long process. Time passed. I exhaled for more hours.\n\nSleep. Would. Not. Come.\n\nI needed a new plan. I decided to go back to the offices where they gave me the drug. Maybe they would have something that could counteract its effects. Or at least something to knock me out until it wore off.\n\nI exited my apartment as fast as possible \u2013 taking hours in my time-frame to do so. I didn\u2019t even bother locking the door. It would have taken too long.\n\nDown the stairs (it\u2019s faster than the elevator if you run), through the lobby, out the front door and onto the street. These few things felt like a long day at the office.\n\nSprinting down the street, dancing and weaving between pedestrians with, what must have looked to them, superhuman dexterity. Down the first flight of stairs at the metro. Across the landing. Another hour. Then on to the second flight of stairs. That\u2019s when the Ambien hit me.\n\nThe Ambien didn\u2019t make me sleepy. Not at all. Instead, it must have had a severe cross-reaction with the experimental drug I took this morning. I was bounding down the second flight of stairs, moving in slow motion, but still making perceptible progress. Then, wham \u2013 everything stopped.\n\nThe dull roar of the street and metro noise ceased, replaced by the most perfect silence I\u2019ve ever experienced. My downwards motion seemed to completely freeze. Before the Ambien kicked in, my perception of time was maybe a few hundred times slower than real-time. After the Ambien took effect, time moved *thousands* of times slower. Every second seemed like days to me. Even just moving my eyes to focus on a new point was like an impossibly slow scroll across my visual field.\n\nOver the course of the afternoon, I learned how to walk, run, and jump when my mind ran hundreds of times faster than my body. But with another four or five orders of magnitude of slow-down caused by the Ambien, body control was almost impossible. I fell on the stairs. Even though I was all-but-frozen in mid-step, controlling my muscles was impossible. I commanded my foot forwards for hours, then backwards for hours more when it seemed like I would miss the next step. Hours attempting to adjust the angle of my ankle, then re-adjusting when it felt wrong.\n\nDespite these efforts, I rolled my ankle on the next step. The pain wasn\u2019t at all mitigated by the slowness. Hours of increasing strain on my bent ankle. The nerve signals that send pain into the brain must work differently than the nerves in my ear. Sonic energy was spread out over time, diluted until it was imperceptible. Pain flowed into my brain undiluted by the change in my perception of time. Hours and hours of increasing weight on my turned ankle turned into hours of increasing pain upon increasing pain.\n\nI pitched forwards, my high-speed mind completely unable to control my low-speed body. I drifted downwards for days, managing to rotate my torso enough to keep my head from impacting the ground first. I eventually landed on my right shoulder. At first the impact wasn\u2019t even noticeable. Then I felt a slight pressure in my shoulder as it came in contact with the ground. The pressure grew, bringing increasing pain, for hour upon hour. My shoulder finally gave out, popping out of its socket with an endless sickening tug.\n\nI came to a stop days later, crumpled onto the ground, staring at the ceiling. The pain in my shoulder still screaming with the intensity of a fresh violent injury. I had plenty of time to think during that fall. If every second seemed like days to me, then each minute of real-world time would be like *years*. Even if the drug cleared out of my system in the next two or three hours, this nightmare would seem to last *centuries*.\n\nBy the time I hit the ground, I had a plan. I would somehow get to the platform and throw myself in front of a train.\n\nI twisted onto my hands and knees. Days of my dislocated shoulder crying for relief. I misjudged my rotation and rolled onto my back. I tried again, collapsing onto my face as I tried to figure out how to control a body that moved slower than grass grew. *Weeks* of effort were finally rewarded with success \u2013 I stabilized on my hands and knees.\n\nIf just getting on all fours was this difficult, I figured that walking or running was completely out of the question. So I crawled. I crawled through the metro tunnel. The dumb looks on the faces in the crowd lingered on me for weeks. I crawled under the turnstyle and onto the escalator.\n\nThe escalator spilled the rush-hour crowd onto the platform at the same speed a glacier spills ice into the sea. I looked out over the crowded platform during my interminable downward ride. The train status sign said the next train wouldn\u2019t arrive for *twenty minutes*. Twenty minutes was like a year to me. I\u2019d have to spend a year on the metro platform, waiting to die.\n\nI crawled off the escalator, enduring days of stupid expressions on the commuters\u2019 faces. I crawled a few feet to a concrete bench and curled up next to it, trying to find a position to lessen the pain in my shoulder. Then my problem with time got worse. Impossibly worse.\n\nThe massive slowdown on the stairs was just the beginning of the interaction between the experimental drug and the Ambien. It fully hit me while I was curled up by the bench. I blinked. Years of darkness followed. Sound was already gone, and with my blink, sight was gone as well. All that existed was the pain from my fall.\n\nMy hyper-accelerated mind wasted no time compensating for the lack of sensory input. Voices spoke to me. They sung to me in languages that never existed. Patterns and faces and colors came and went in my mind\u2019s eye. I recalled my whole life, and imagined living another. I forgot English. I settled into a profound despair. I spoke to God. I became God. I imagined a new universe and brought it to life with my thoughts. Then I did it all again. And again.\n\nMy eyes opened with geologic slowness. A faint glow. Weeks. A slit of light. Weeks. A narrow view of the metro platform \u2013 ankles of the commuters near me and an advertisement on the opposite wall.\n\nI extracted my phone from my pocket. A project that spanned decades. How can I even explain the boredom? The pain in my shoulder is nothing compared to the boredom. Every thought I can think, I have thought hundreds of times already. The view of ankles and advertisements never changes. Never. The boredom is so intense it\u2019s tangible \u2013 like a solid object of metal and stone wedged into my skull. Inescapable.\n\nWhat are my options? If I crawl and fall onto the tracks without an oncoming train to crush me, I won\u2019t die. I\u2019ll experience even more pain from the four-foot fall, but I\u2019ll most likely be rescued by some do-gooder on the platform and unable to act when the train finally does arrive. My suffering in that scenario will be endless.\n\nSo I wait for the train. So I can throw myself under it. When it finally hits me, I will experience the pain of being ripped to pieces for centuries until finally, the light of life leaves my brain, and my experience ends.\n\nI\u2019ve lived hundreds of lifespans at the foot of this bench. I am far older, in spirit, than any human who has ever lived. Most of my life experience has been a snapshot of pain huddled on the floor of a subway platform, with an unchanging view of ankles and advertisements.\n\nThis post is my plan B. My Hail Mary. My long-shot. I\u2019ve spent lifetimes typing and posting this message in the hope that someone will read it and become convinced that my suffering must end. Someone on this platform right now. Someone who will find the man curled under the bench, the man who crawled down the escalator, and kill him as swiftly as possible. A bullet to the temple.\n\nIf you\u2019re armed and at the Glenmont metro, please shoot me.\n\n[pfd](https:\/\/www.anewkindofmonster.com\/)"},"209":{"title":"Spacegirl","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/declk8\/spacegirl\/","flair":"Spooktober","author":"HeadOfSpectre","selftext":"We called her Spacegirl.   \n\n\nHer real name was Megan Daniels, but nobody actually called her that. She\u2019d been Spacegirl since Grade 2. She was the kind of kid who stuck out in the crowd with her long red hair, ghostly pale skin and coke bottle glasses. For as long as I\u2019d known her, Spacegirl had been quiet. She didn\u2019t like to be around us. She didn\u2019t play with us when we were kids, she didn\u2019t even talk much.  \n\n\nMost of the time, she\u2019d find somewhere to sit, far away from everyone else. Then she\u2019d open up her little notebook and scribble inside of it. Sometimes she wrote poems, sometimes she drew. But she was always off on her own little world. Nowadays, I understand why we targeted her. She was different, and she was alone. That doesn\u2019t justify any of it, but kids can be cruel. I remember that it was Sasha Brown who told me that Spacegirl was retarded because her Mother was on drugs. She probably just made that up. But we all believed it. She had always been the worst towards Spacegirl, and she kept that up until the end.   \n\n\nIt all started in Grade 5 when Sasha took her notebook.\n\nIt had been raining that day, so we\u2019d had an indoor recess. Spacegirl sat in the corner at her desk, eyes focused on her notebook as she methodically worked on a drawing. Sasha and I had been sitting nearby at our desks, and we simply just watched her do her thing.\n\n  \u201cI can\u2019t believe they let that retard sit in with us.\u201d Sasha murmured, \u201cLook at her\u2026 Why do they even let them in schools? They aren\u2019t gonna learn anything.\u201d  \n   \u201cBetter than leaving her at home with her crackhead Mom.\u201d Said Tanya Evrett. She and I weren\u2019t exactly friends, but she sat close to Sasha and I. \u201cMy Dad says he sees a different car in front of her house every day. He says that she lets boys come and they pay her so they can have S-E-X.\u201d None of us could actually say the dreaded S word at the time. Sex was still a terrible unknown thing, and we all had been raised to believe that nobody decent would ever do it.  \n\n\nSpacegirl paused, and her eyes darted away from her book, to look at us. I can only imagine she\u2019d heard us. Sasha just stared right back at her.   \n\n\n  \u201cWhat? Do you have a problem, Spacegirl?\u201d She asked. The Teacher was out of earshot, and that gave her carte blanche to say whatever she wanted. Spacegirl didn\u2019t respond. She just looked back down at her notebook, but Sasha had been challenged (or at least she thought she\u2019d been). She looked over to the Teachers desk to make sure she was busy, then she got up and moved closer to Spacegirl. \n\n  \u201cWhat are you even doing in there, retard?\u201d \n\nShe\u2019d reached out to snatch the book before Spacegirl could stop her. \n\n  \u201cWhat even is this? A Unicorn? What are you, five?\u201d \n\nShe handed the book to me, and I took it on instinct. There was a brightly colored drawing of a Unicorn inside. The artwork was actually pretty nice, but I would never have said so. The book was passed on to Tanya next, and Spacegirl could only look at us helplessly. \n\n  \u201cWow. You can\u2019t even draw. Look at this?\u201d\n\nShe tore the page out of the notebook, and Spacegirl let out a startled whimper, as if she\u2019d been struck. The picture was crumpled up and the book was thrown on the floor by Spacegirls desk.\n\n  \u201cDraw something that isn\u2019t trash next time.\u201d Tanya said, and Sasha just giggled as if it was anything other than being mean spirited just for the sake of it. \n\nSpacegirl slowly picked her book up off the floor, avoiding eye contact as Tanya and Sasha turned away from her. I continued to stare. I remember that the way she moved was so defeated, as if she were shrinking in on herself. She looked up at me, but only for a moment and I felt bad for her. I really did. But I didn\u2019t do anything about it. I just left her to rejoin the others.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter that, Spacegirl became an easy target for Sasha and Tanya. Every chance they got, they\u2019d harass her and I regret to admit that I was usually right there with them.\n\nDuring the days where we could go outside for recess, Spacegirl would always sit beneath the same tree, always working in her notebook. When she did, we would always lean on the trunk and look down over Spacegirls shoulder.\n\n  \u201cWow, that\u2019s really good, Spacegirl.\u201d Was how most of her comments would start, \u201cDid you mean to draw it like it got hit by a truck, or is that just your style?\u201d\n\nThere was never a compliment. She would always find something to needle.\n\n  \u201cCan you draw me?\u201d Sasha asked once, \u201cI heard that retards were always like, art geniuses or something. Maybe it\u2019ll even look like a person!\u201d\n\nSpacegirl didn\u2019t look up at her. She seemed to be trying not to acknowledge the insults. I won\u2019t pretend like I was blameless either. I never stopped them, and there were plenty of times where I was right there, making fun of her because that was what we did, and we weren\u2019t the only ones. More or less everyone hurt her in some way or another. But she never complained. I think she was too scared to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was late December in 7th grade where things got even worse. I don\u2019t know all the details, and I don\u2019t know just for how long things had been boiling over, but I\u2019d heard a rumor that James Hardy had it out for Spacegirl.  \n\n\nJames had only been in my class a few times, and he wasn\u2019t in my class that year. He was a small, mousy looking kid who was convinced he was the world's toughest gangster. The rumors said that someone had seen his Dad going into Spacegirls house. Naturally there had been speculation that they'd been having sex. Someone told me that James\u2019 parents had been divorcing because of it. Somehow all of these rumors had mutated into claims that James and Spacegirl were dating and I think that was what had rubbed him the wrong way.  \n\n\nWe were coming in from recess when some boys decided to pull a little prank on James. The whole prank had been set up by Brian Jordan and his brother Mike. They had some mistletoe for the Holiday season, and had set it up in the hall leading back to our classroom. Mike had grabbed Spacegirl during recess and were holding her behind the door where the mistletoe was. When James walked through, they pushed her at him and snapped a picture. I\u2019d been just behind James when it happened. I watched as Spacegirl came flying out of seemingly nowhere, eyes wide and afraid, then slammed into James. They both hit the ground, and I could hear the other boys laughing.  \n\n\n  \u201cLOOK! She wanted to give you a kiss!\u201d One the boys said. Spacegirl was trying to crawl away from James and pick up her notebook, but somebody had kicked it out of sight. I remember that she looked back towards James, and there were tears in her eyes. She must have been terrified with everything that was going on. She clearly hadn\u2019t wanted any part in this, but there she was at the center of it.\n\n \u201cYou fucking faggot assholes!\u201d James yelled as he picked himself up.\n\n  \u201cHey, she just wanted to give you a smooch!\u201d aughed Brian, \u201cCome on, give her a kiss!\u201d \n\nSomeone pushed Spacegirl towards James, and he glared at her as if all of this was her fault. She tried to stand and run, but he was angry and he wasn\u2019t thinking straight. I watched as he grabbed her and hit her. A square punch to the jaw. Then he tossed her to the ground and went after Brian next. A teacher had to get in to pull James off of him. He, Spacegirl and the Jordan Brothers ended up getting suspended right before the Christmas holidays. We didn\u2019t see Spacegirl until January\u2026 we didn\u2019t see James or his friends ever again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn Christmas Eve, there was a car accident on the highway outside of my town. Supposedly it had swerved off the road to avoid an animal of some kind, and gone into a ditch. Mike, Brian and their parents didn\u2019t survive. On December 27th, James was killed while outside shoveling his driveway. My Parents told me that he\u2019d been attacked by an animal. Probably a deer or something. But that seemed so unusual\u2026 I\u2019d never heard anything about deer attacking people before. Especially not in my area.  \n\n\nI went over to Sasha\u2019s house on the day before New Years. We\u2019d both gotten some gift cards for Christmas and we were planning to walk to the mall together to use them. Her parents weren\u2019t home, they both had to work. So it was just us when I got there.\n\n  \u201cHey! Kept me waiting!\u201d She said when I knocked on the door.   \n   \u201cSorry.\u201d   \n   \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll be ready in a bit. Come on upstairs, I wanna show you something!\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t question what it was. I figured it was just something else she\u2019d gotten for Christmas, so I went upstairs with her.\n\n  \u201cYou\u2019re gonna love it.\u201d She promised me, \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be so funny\u2026\u201d\n\nShe led me to her bedroom, and as soon as she opened the door, I spotted a familiar notebook on her desk.  \n   \u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d I asked, walking closer to it.\n\n  \u201cSpacegirl dropped it when Brian and his Brother pulled that prank the other day, she dropped it. I may have grabbed it\u2026 Y\u2019know. Just for safekeeping.\u201d  \n\n\nShe cracked a wry grin, before opening the notebook.  \n\n\n  \u201cLook at this\u2026 She\u2019s been drawing the same damn Unicorns forever. She didn\u2019t even finish this one!\u201d\n\nShe paused at one small picture that was labeled \u2018The Unicorn Prince\u2019. It depicted an empty field with a blank space where the titular Prince should have been. Sasha flipped through the pages a little more until she got to the newer ones.\n\n  \n  \u201cI figured since they kicked Spacegirl out for a little while, and her Mom is too poor to get her anything for the holidays, I\u2019d step up! What do you think?\u201d Sasha wasn\u2019t anywhere near as good of an artist as Spacegirl was, but the simple detail in what she had drawn turned my stomach.\n\n  \nIn her first picture, Spacegirl was hanging from a rope. Her tongue was hanging out, and her eyes were closed.   \nIn the second one, Spacegirl had a gun in her mouth.   \nIn the third one, she was standing on the edge of a building. \n\nSasha giggled as I flipped through her crude depictions of suicide. There were pages of them.\n\n  \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d She asked with a grin, \u201cI\u2019ll bet she\u2019ll lose her shit!\u201d\n\nI closed the notebook and looked over at Sasha.\n\n  \u201cA-are you out of your mind?\u201d I asked. Sasha\u2019s grin faded.\n\n  \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n  \u201cYou stole her notebook, just so you could draw these? Sasha, that\u2019s really messed up!\u201d  \n   \u201cIt\u2019s Spacegirl, who the hell cares about Spacegirl, Jane?\u201d\n\n  \u201cYou just\u2026 drew her killing herself over and over again!\u201d I took the book off her desk, \u201cDo you not understand what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d\n\nSasha just stared at me like I was crazy.\n\n  \u201cFine. Sue me for trying to be funny.\u201d Sasha said, \u201cJust give it here\u2026\u201d She outstretched a hand to take the notebook, but I pulled back from her. \n\n  \u201cNo. You\u2019re just going to put something else in there.\u201d\n\nAnger flared in Sasha\u2019s eyes.\n\n  \u201cJane, just give me the book.\u201d\n\n  \u201cNo!\u201d  \n\n\nI opened the book, and I started to tear out those pages of Spacegirls suicide. Sasha lunged for me, trying to grab at the book and stop me, but  pushed her back. I didn\u2019t mean to push so hard, but I did and she fell, landing hard on the ground. For a moment, Sasha looked up at me, wide eyed and shocked. I don\u2019t think anyone had laid a hand on her like that before. Then I saw something in her eyes\u2026 Not just anger. Something worse. It was the same thing that had prompted her to draw those horrible pictures of Spacegirl. I turned and I ran, bolting down her stairs and out her front door, back into the snow. I clutched Spacegirls notebook to my chest the entire time and I didn\u2019t let it go until I got home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI spent the rest of the Christmas break terrified that my parents would get a call from Sasha\u2019s. I\u2019d pushed her, and that seemed like such a big deal at the time. In hindsight, I doubt Sasha would have told her parents what had happened. They would have asked why I\u2019d pushed her, and I would have told them about the notebook. On some level, she must have known that what she\u2019d done was wrong. She was a cruel person, but there was a limit. Part of me hoped that she\u2019d realize that I was right and we could patch things up when School started again, but honestly I wasn\u2019t so sure.   \n\n\nI remember looking through Spacegirls drawings. The ones that she\u2019d done. I remembered the ones I\u2019d made fun of the most. There was one with a mermaid on a rock, combing her hair. Her eyes were closed in a relaxed bliss. I remembered saying how stupid her facial expression had looked, but honestly, I kinda liked it. I flipped through the pages some more, through Unicorns, Fairies and Castles. But I paused at the page depicting the Unicorn Prince. Back at Sasha\u2019s place, it had been blank, but at my house it was finished. The Unicorn Prince stood proudly in his field, looking skywards with his horn proudly displayed. Maybe I had been thinking of a different picture?  \n\n\nI brushed it off and flipped to the back where Sasha\u2019s pictures were. One by one, I started tearing them out of the notebook and tossing them in the trash. It was a waste of paper, but I refused to give it back to Spacegirl with those images still in it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the first day back to school, I was up early. I made sure the notebook was packed into my bag and was out as early as I could be. The snow on the ground was almost pristine as I walked to school, but I remember seeing some tracks on my lawn, headed down the side of my house. Deep U shaped indents that looked like they\u2019d been made by hooves. A deer perhaps? I didn\u2019t dwell on them and made my way down the freshly shoveled sidewalk and back to school.   \n\n\nI wasn\u2019t entirely sure if Spacegirl would be back yet, but she was. She was alone in the classroom, sitting at her desk and drawing in a brand new notebook. She paused briefly when I walked in to join her, and I could see her sideying me. She didn\u2019t say a word as I drew nearer, but I thought I saw her shoulders tense up ever so slightly.\n\n  \u201cHey.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I hope you had a nice Holiday.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t respond.\n\n  \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what happened the other day. I didn\u2019t know anything about it, but it just seemed really mean spirited.\u201d\n\nStill no answer. I reached into my backpack, taking out her old notebook. I put it on her desk in front of her. She stared at it, still silent, then back at me.\n\n  \u201cSasha took it. I was over at her house the other day and she showed it to me. I had to take some pages out, but she drew some really awful things in there. I didn\u2019t think it would be right to give it back with those things in there\u2026\u201d I paused, feeling smaller as Spacegirl stared at me. She didn\u2019t seem angry or thankful. She didn\u2019t seem anything at all. Just stoic.\n\n  \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I wasn\u2019t all that great to you before.\u201d I said, and then I shuffled off to by desk. Spacegirl waited until I sat down before she opened her notebook and inspected it. Then she closed her new book, and started something new on a fresh page in her old one. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t much. But it made me feel at least a little good for what I\u2019d done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen Sasha got in, she didn\u2019t talk to me. She didn\u2019t even look at me. Neither did Tanya or any of our other mutual friends. I knew from the moment they walked in that I\u2019d burned my bridges with them. But I still wanted to try.\n\nThe Teacher hadn\u2019t come in yet, so I figured it might be worth it to try and talk to Sasha. I got up to move closer to her and she gave me a look of utter disgust.  \n\n\n  \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d She spat. \n\nNow it was my turn to be silent.  \n\n\n  \u201cFuck off and leave us alone.\u201d Tanya said, \u201cYou\u2019d obviously rather hang out with the fucking retard than us, and I really don\u2019t want you spreading your retard germs to us. It\u2019s a quarantine issue.\u201d   \n\n\nI stared at both of them, and I could\u2019ve sworn I knew how Spacegirl felt\u2026 What was I supposed to say to any of that? Instead, I just returned to my desk without a word. Spacegirl stared at me the entire time. Her pencil rested over her notebook, but she didn\u2019t write anything. She set it down, tore out the page she\u2019d been writing on and jammed it into her pocket. I later saw her toss it into the trash during lunch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn\u2019t really have anyone left\u2026 So I thought that maybe it might be a good idea to pull it out. Maybe it was something she wasn\u2019t happy with? I\u2019d never seen her throw a drawing out before. I was thinking that maybe I could use it as a peace offering of sorts, or something along those lines. When I saw what she\u2019d written on it, I almost threw it back into the trash.   \n\n\n**Your Words**\n\n*There is a land where your sorry may go.*\n\n*A sickening land where it always snows*\n\n*The snow is putrid in color and smell*\n\n*It's substance- filth and things I won't tell.*\n\n*Only your Father has been there before.*\n\n*One day your boyfriend will visit once more.*\n\n*This place in your carcass this humanoid hell.*\n\n*Your sorry can go there to this hole in your shell*\n\n*My unsubtle message, this subtextual jazz.*\n\n*Is take your apology and stuff it up your ass.*  \n\n\nThis was unlike anything I\u2019d ever seen her write. It was so crass and spiteful\u2026 This was as close to hatred as she could have gotten. I understood why she\u2019d thrown it out. It didn\u2019t fit with everything else she\u2019d done. Those things had been beautiful, despite what people had said to her. This was angry and ugly\u2026 This was something she\u2019d written for me. I put it in my pocket. I wasn\u2019t going to give it back to her, but I wanted to keep it. I wanted to remember the way I\u2019d made her feel. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEighth grade wasn\u2019t fun for me. \n\nI had very few friends left, and Sasha never forgave me for turning on her. Her version of the story was slowly warped as time went on. First I\u2019d punched her and stolen the book. Then I\u2019d tried to kiss her, punched her when she\u2019d refused, then stole the book to try and get her in trouble. Rumors of me being a dyke spread pretty quickly, and hot on their heels came the rumors that I was dating Spacegirl. I tried not to let them bother me too much. I knew the truth and at the end of the day, I\u2019d done the right thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy the time High School rolled around, I was hoping for a fresh start. There were new faces, and I figured I could make friends with them before Sashas rumors spread. I had a bit of success in that department. I fell in with a better crowd at least.   \n\n\nSasha stuck with her same old clique. It grew ever so slightly, but she was determined to live out the movie Mean Girls and most people didn\u2019t pay her any mind.   \nSpacegirl barely changed at all. I didn\u2019t see her much when High School started. She was in a few of my classes, but I rarely saw her outside of them. Whenever she had a moment, she\u2019d be in the library, usually in one of the corner cubicles, working on her drawings. Sometimes I thought about talking to her and trying to strike up a friendship\u2026 but it never felt right.   \n\n\nSasha\u2019s bullying never let up of course. Of course she stalked Spacegirl to the library where she\u2019d pull the same old shit she\u2019d been pulling since the fifth grade. She\u2019d leer over her cubicle and comment on her drawings. Picking them apart just like she always had. I stopped her whenever I saw it\u2026 but I didn\u2019t always see it.\n\n  \u201cComing to her rescue again, huh Jane?\u201d Sasha asked once when I\u2019d interrupted her. Tanya leered at me from behind her, chewing gum with her mouth open. \n\n  \u201cWhat\u2019s she ever done to you anyways?\u201d I asked, \u201cShe\u2019s just minding her own business.\u201d\n\n  \u201cOh? What\u2019s she done to you, dyke?\u201d Sasha hissed. She leaned down over her cubicle and looked down at the notebook.\n\n  \u201cUnicorns\u2026 Unicorns, unicorns, fucking unicorns\u2026 When are you going to grow up Spacegirl?\u201d  \n   \u201cHey! I told you to stop.\u201d I rounded the cubicle and I saw Sasha recoil. For a moment, I saw a bit of fear in her eyes. It vanished quickly and was replaced with a familiar rage.  \n\n\n  \u201cFine.\u201d She said, \u201cTan, let\u2019s leave the happy couple to their alone time.\u201d  \nShe pulled away from the cubicle and disappeared with Tanya nipping at her heels like a faithful terrier. \n\nSpacegirl remained hunched over her notebook, her long red hair spilling over her shoulders. She seemed impossibly still.\n\nI turned to leave her when I heard:\n\n  \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\nI looked back at her and saw that she was looking at me.\n\n  \u201cUm\u2026 You\u2019re welcome.\u201d I said, \u201cLet me know if she bothers you again, alright?\u201d\n\n  \u201cI will. But\u2026 you\u2019re usually there anyways.\u201d \n\nHer voice was soft and low. I\u2019d heard it before, but I don\u2019t remember her ever speaking directly to me.\n\n  \u201cYeah, well. It\u2019s just not right. She\u2019s such a child. One of these days she\u2019s going to have to grow up.\u201d\n\nSpacegirl just nodded, looking over towards the library door, then back down at her notebook again. \n\nFor a moment, I thought about asking her about what she was drawing. I thought about saying something else, but\u2026 No. I didn\u2019t want to make her uncomfortable. I left her alone again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn tenth grade, I took art as an elective. I wasn\u2019t much of an artist, but I figured it would be an easy course. To the surprise of no one, Spacegirl was there. I actually asked her to work with me on a few group projects. I think the prospect of being asked to work together was foreign to her. She looked at me suspiciously when I did it, but when she smiled, it was the biggest smile I\u2019d ever seen.  \n\n\nI went to her house for the first time to work on a portrait project with her once. We were supposed to take turns drawing portraits of each other and I\u2019d volunteered to let her draw me first. Rumors of her Mother had always surrounded Spacegirl, so I wasn\u2019t entirely sure what to expect when I got there. I certainly wasn\u2019t expecting the quiet, neatly kept house that I found.  \n\n\nThe Woman who answered the door looked like an older version of her daughter, sans the coke bottle glasses.\n\n  \u201cYou must be Jane.\u201d She said. She wasn\u2019t smiling, but she didn\u2019t sound upset either.\n\n  \u201cYes ma\u2019am\u2026\u201d\n\n  \u201cCome on in. Megan's upstairs. She was just getting ready for you.\u201d\n\nThe house was warm with plenty of knick knacks on the walls. Plates and porcelain dolls mostly. Her Mom sent me upstairs and I didn't waste any time. On the landing leading up to Spacegirls room, I could see a mural of family photos and paused to look at them. I could recognize Spacegirl and her Mother in most of them. Spacegirl never seemed to be smiling. I only saw her Father in a few of the very early pictures. Spacegirl looked like she was only a young child in the few pictures I saw him in though. I didn\u2019t dwell for long and headed towards what I assumed was her room. The cardboard stars and planets on it gave it away.  \n\n\nSure enough, she was inside waiting for me. She sat facing the door behind an easel in the center of her room. Her bed was neatly made and tucked away in the corner. She had a clean little desk that she\u2019d clearly been working on and had set a chair out for me to sit on. I hadn\u2019t expected something so overwhelmingly formal and I almost started laughing\u2026 But then I noticed her walls.  \n\n\nThey weren\u2019t just covered in drawings. The art pieces on them were full on paintings. They were the same fantasy depictions she usually did, but the colors were so vivid. The clouds looked like fluffy pillows and the castles seemed great and infinite.\n\n  \u201cHoly shit, are these yours?\u201d\n\n  \u201cThey are.\u201d Spacegirl said softly. She stood up and took the plate of cookies from me, then moved it to her desk.\n\n  \u201cIt\u2026 it\u2019s soothing.\u201d She said after a while, \u201cPainting, I mean. I pick the drawings I like the most and\u2026 I finish them.\u201d\n\nShe spoke slowly, like she was carefully choosing her words. I almost felt like there was something that she was trying to avoid. I spotted a painting on the floor that looked like her Father. The style was the same but the content was different. He was surrounded by awkward scribbles, and he looked completely and utterly terrified. Spacegirl looked down at it, but she seemed to disapprove of it. She turned it around so I wouldn\u2019t have to look at it.  \n\n\n  \u201cWe should get started.\u201d She said, \u201cSorry\u2026\u201d\n\n  \u201cNo, it\u2019s alright!\u201d I said. I sat in the chair for her. \u201cI\u2019d like to hear about it.\u201d\n\nSpacegirl watched me from the corner of her eye for a moment, as if she doubted I was being serious. But eventually she sat down behind the easel and started to draw\u2026 Soon after that, she was talking too. I stayed long after she\u2019d gotten what she needed for her sketch, just to talk. She told me that she\u2019d always liked fantasy, and how she liked Unicorns because they were simple but pretty. I hung on to every word, and I could\u2019ve sworn I saw her smiling shyly as she talked.   \n\n\nThe portrait she\u2019d done of me was something else entirely. Her work had always been beautiful\u2026 but this made me look transcendent. I wasn\u2019t entirely sure that I was looking at myself at first. There was something about the look on my face. There was a small, almost content smile there. The warmth it conveyed was almost disney-esque.\n\n  \u201cI love it.\u201d I told her, \u201cThat\u2019s incredible Spa\u2026 Megan\u2026 That\u2019s really great!\u201d\n\n  \u201cYou can call me Spacegirl if you want.\u201d She said, \u201cI don\u2019t mind the nickname\u2026 Not as much as I mind the people at least.\u201d\n\nMy awe quickly turned to shame, but Spacegirl didn\u2019t look upset\u2026 She just stared at me blankly like she so often did. No\u2026 not blankly. Her face might not have conveyed much emotion, but there was definitely some emotion there. \n\n  \u201cI wish\u2026 I wish I\u2019d been nicer to you, when we were younger.\u201d I said.\n\n  \u201cIs that why you\u2019re here right now?\u201d Spacegirl asked.\n\n  \u201cNo! I\u2026 I\u2019m here for the assignment. I mean\u2026 the art assignment. The portraits\u2026\u201d \n\nShe continued to stare. \n\n  \u201cDid you pick me because you felt bad for me?\u201d She asked. \n\n  \u201cNo! I just thought it would be cool to work with you.\u201d\n\nSpacegirl didn't react for a moment, but then she just nodded. \n\n  \u201cOkay.\u201d Her flat tone made it hard to know what she meant by that. She stood up and walked over to the portrait. \n\n  \u201cMom can drive you home if you need a ride.\u201d She said. I opened my mouth to say something else. I wanted to apologize, but I didn\u2019t know what.Had I offended her? Had I said something wrong?\n\n  \u201cAlright. Thanks.\u201d It was the only thing I could think of. \u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d\n\nWith that, I left her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was almost afraid to see Spacegirl the next morning. I drifted through my classes that day until I reached art\u2026 and when I did, I wasn\u2019t expecting what I saw. She had clearly been up late\u2026 but what she\u2019d brought in stole my breath away.  \n\n\nIt was my portrait, but she\u2019d done more with it than I thought possible. She\u2019d painted over the sketch, turning me into something beautiful. Flowers bloomed around my brown hair and a crown of daisies, lilies and chrysanthemums adorned my head. The colors were so vivid, and I looked so at peace in it. Spacegirl was looking right at me as I came in, as if she was gauging my reaction. But all I could do was stare wide eyed and in awe. When I looked back at Spacegirl, she was smiling at me. Her project single handedly netted us an A on the project and got the privilege of being hung up outside of the art classroom. Of course I told her how much I loved it, and I remember the way she smiled when I did. I remember thinking that it was the cutest smile I'd ever seen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy portrait was up for barely even a day before Sasha had to make a comment. I\u2019d been on my lunch, and had just gotten some fries from the cafeteria when she and Tanya ambushed me.\n\n  \u201cWhere\u2019s your flower crown, dyke.\u201d Sasha said, \n\n  \u201cLeave me alone.\u201d I said, brushing past them, but Sasha was out for blood.\n\n  \u201cI always knew you were a little dyke. But now you\u2019ve posted solid proof of it! We\u2019ve gone and cracked the case, haven\u2019t we? So what happened? Did you go to her house and lick her retarded little snatch? You must be a real good dyke because she went and drew that for you!\u201d\n\nI tried to walk away from her, but Sasha and Tanya just kept following me.\n\n  \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Am I not pretty enough for you Dyke?\u201d She snapped at me.\n\n  \u201cMaybe she only fucks retarded girls.\u201d Tanya said, \u201cI\u2019ll bet Spacegirl squealed like a pig when she came.\u201d\n\nI stopped dead in my tracks, and I heard Sasha stop behind me. I don\u2019t know what it was about what she\u2019d said that pissed me off so much. But those two had finally struck a nerve. I spun around, swinging my lunch tray as hard as I could. Fries were scattered everywhere, but although I was aiming for Tanya, I hit Sasha. She went down hard, and I\u2019m not sure if she was even still conscious when she hit the ground. Tanya was on me in an instant. She slammed me back against a wall, and kept me pinned. She had size and strength on me, and there wasn\u2019t a thing I could do to stop her. Several other students grabbed at us. A teacher finally got involved and all three of us got escorted to see the Principal. As we left the cafeteria, I saw Spacegirl in one of the halls, just staring at me.   \n\n\nNaturally I got a three day suspension, but Tanya and Sasha were fine. Both of them said they\u2019d just been walking and I attacked unprovoked. It was their word against mine. Sasha had a familiar shit eating grin on as she left the office with only a bruise on her forehead to show for her troubles, but there was a familiar look in her eyes. That same anger I\u2019d seen last time I\u2019d laid a hand on her\u2026 and something about it scared me.  \n\n\nWhen I came back to school, I realized that I had every reason to be afraid. My portrait was missing. I wondered if they\u2019d taken it down because I\u2019d attacked Sasha, but the truth was a lot worse.\n\n  \u201cSomeone took it.\u201d Spacegirl said. She was sitting in her usual spot in the library when I found her, sketching flowers in her notebook.\n\n  \u201cWhen?\u201d  \n   \u201cThe day after you hit Sasha\u2026 I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s found it yet.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t look up at me. Just stayed focused on her art. She didn\u2019t need to say it for me to know who she blamed. Who else would it be? I had half a mind to confront Sasha about it, but I didn\u2019t know if that would be a good idea or not. Sasha could easily just cry wolf. I wouldn\u2019t put it past her. In the end, it didn't matter.  \n\n\nBy the time I was headed to art class, the painting was back. But there had been some modifications made to it.\n\nThe words:\n\n***Retard Fucking Dyke***\n\nHad been painted across my portrait in bright red. I saw it from down the hall and could see some other students whispering amongst themselves beneath it. I didn\u2019t know what to say or do\u2026 But this felt like too much.  \n\n\nThe picture was taken down quickly\u2026 but the damage was done. Sasha had gotten her revenge, and it didn\u2019t stop with just the painting. Spacegirl looked different than when I\u2019d seen her in the library. She seemed uneasy, and her eyes were red like she\u2019d been crying.\n\n  \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the painting\u2026\u201d I said softly. She looked at me, before sighing.\n\n  \u201cI knew she\u2019d do something like that\u2026\u201d She said, \u201cI\u2019m so used to it by now, that it doesn\u2019t bother me anymore. I\u2019m sorry she wrote those things about you, though.\u201d\n\n  \u201cBut you worked hard on that.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019d be upset too.\u201d\n\nShe just shook her head.\n\n  \u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d She said. She reached into her pocket, pulling out a crumpled up piece of paper then slid it over to me. \n\nSlowly I uncrumpled the paper, and my eyes widened as I recognized what was on it.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the same drawing\u2026 but it was close enough. It was a depiction of Spacegirl hanging herself, and me beside her. A caption read \u2018*Retard Dyke Wedding\u2019.*\n\n  \u201cThere were so many in my locker\u2026\u201d Spacegirl said.\n\n  \u201cThis is what she drew in your notebook\u2026 when I returned it to you\u2026 This is what I had to take out.\u201d\n\nSpacegirl looked down at the picture again, before averting her eyes. She didn\u2019t pay much attention during class. Instead of taking notes, she sketched in her notebook. I looked over a few times to see her drawing another Unicorn. This one seemed so similar to the one I\u2019d seen before. She must not have been quite happy with it though\u2026 When I looked back at her notebook, the Unicorn wasn\u2019t there anymore. She must have just erased it\u2026 but it seemed so clean. Like it hadn\u2019t been erased at all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTanya was following me on my walk home that evening. I didn\u2019t know what she had in mind, but I didn\u2019t want to put up with it. When I was in the middle of a small walking path that cut behind some of the houses on my street, I stopped and looked at Tanya as she kept approaching.\n\n  \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I asked.\n\n  \u201cIt\u2019s a surprise.\u201d She said, \u201cSasha and I just want you to know how much we love Dykes in this town\u2026 Oops, I\u2019ve said too much.\u201d\n\nI wanted to hit her. Dear God I just wanted to hit her, but we both knew she could overpower me. Whatever Tanya had in mind\u2026 it wasn\u2019t anything good. She drew closer to me, unafraid of anything I\u2019d do.\n\n  \u201cCome on, Dyke. Go home.\u201d She said. \u201cLet\u2019s go check out your surprise.\u201d\n\nIn a sudden horrible moment, I realized that Tanya was threatening me. I also realized that I couldn\u2019t outrun her\u2026 I couldn\u2019t fight her off. I didn\u2019t really have much of a choice but to do as she asked. Slowly, I turned and walked towards my house, with Tanya at my heels. It wasn\u2019t far, and up ahead I could see Sasha sitting on a park bench. From a distance, I recognized the red gas can beside her, and I stopped dead in my tracks.\n\nTanya seized me by the arm and pulled me towards the bench. Sasha just watched with a wide, manic grin.\n\n  \u201cHey Jane.\u201d She said, \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d\n\n  \u201cWhat the fuck is this?!\u201d\n\n  \u201cJust wanted to chat.\u201d Sasha said with a cold chuckle, \u201cYou think you can get away with pulling the shit you did the other day. No. You\u2019ve been treating me like garbage for years, and for what? Because of Spacegirl? You know who you\u2019re fucking choosing, right? Right? God\u2026 I hate that retard girl. But you know what? I hate you even more. Acting like you\u2019re better than me just because you feel bad for her.\u201d\n\n  \u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d \n\nSasha just laughed.\n\n  \u201cI\u2019m not the one who clocked someone with a fucking tray just for a little bit of teasing. You\u2019re absolutely fucking psycho!\u201d\n\nOn the bench behind her, I saw the portrait that Spacegirl had painted of me. Sasha picked it up and tossed it in front of me, then picked up the gas can and dumped it onto the canvas.\n\n  \u201cYou wanna be a Dyke, I don\u2019t care. But I\u2019m not letting you and your retarded whore put your shit up! So say goodbye to your little project, slut!\u201d\n\nSasha reached into her pocket and took out a book of matches. Her grin widened, before suddenly vanishing outright as she looked at something behind us.   \n   \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Tanya said, and I craned my neck to try and see what they were seeing. As for believing it\u2026 that was another story entirely.  \n\n\nStanding on the path behind us was a Unicorn\u2026 but the way it looked was all wrong. This was nothing like a regular horse. Its body was plain white and almost textureless save for the many thin blue lines that ran along its body. It looked like it had been cut out from a sheet of lined paper but\u2026 that was impossible\u2026 It had to be impossible. Neatly done grey lines defined the shape of the horse. In fact, the lines reminded me of the ones Spacegirl used. This Unicorn looked like it had walked out of one of her notebooks!\n\nTanya let me go and stumbled back a few steps, wide eyed as she stared at the advancing Unicorn. It let out an angry noise before charging straight for Tanya. She panicked and tried to run. In her desperation to escape, she bolted down the path. But she couldn\u2019t outrun the paper Unicorn. It lowered its head as it drew nearer to her, and in one swift movement, the horn pierced Tanya\u2019s back, impaling her straight through the chest. She screamed as she was hoisted off the ground and the Unicorn circled back to fix Sasha in a murderous glare.   \n\n\nTanya looked down at the massive spike sticking out of her, her eyes clearly wide with horror and her body twitching its last spasms as the life quickly drained from her. The Unicorn lowered its head to let her slide off of its horn and she hit the ground in a bundle of limbs.  \n\n\nSasha and I stared in silent horror as the Unicorn reared up on its hind legs and brought its hooves down upon Tanya\u2019s body. She didn\u2019t scream. She didn\u2019t fight. She simply lay there as she was trampled again and again. I can only hope she died quickly.  \n\n\nSasha dropped the unlit match and took a slow, terrified step back before toppling over. I stumbled back and looked down to see the portrait of me at her feet. But it had changed. That beautifully painted version of me was now leaning out of the canvas, invading the real world and clutching Sasha\u2019s leg tightly.\n\nStill with that look of contentment on her face, I watched as the Painted Me slowly slipped back into her panting, and she took Sasha\u2019s leg with her.\n\n  \u201cFUCK, FUCK, FUCK!\u201d\n\nSasha desperately swatted at the Painted Me, but she couldn\u2019t overpower it. She couldn\u2019t escape. Her nails tried to dig into the pavement as she was slowly dragged into the canvas. She looked at me in horror, silently begging for help but all I could do was stare back at her in silence.\n\n  \u201cJANE! JANE HELP! PLEASE! PLEASE!\"\n\nThe hands of the Painted Me reached up, seizing Sasha by the hair and forcing her down into the canvas. It was like watching something pull her underwater. One minute she was there, the next she was gone. I stood silent in the park, staring at the painting, then at the paper Unicorn. The Unicorn huffed before retreating off into the woods and then I was alone.  \n\n\nSlowly, I approached the painting and I looked down at it. It had changed and now it depicted Sasha, her mouth open in a horrified final scream. After some hesitation, I picked up the painting. I could return it to Spacegirl in the morning. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey chalked Tanya\u2019s death up to an animal attack, and nobody ever found Sasha. I never asked Spacegirl about what I saw. I don\u2019t think even she knew the answer, although she certainly knew much more than I did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHigh School was ten years ago though, and I\u2019ve chosen not to remember as much as I can. I\u2019ve got my own life to live now and I try not to ask so many questions. Sometimes I see paintings move, but I don\u2019t bother with a second glance and I never ask my wife about them. She doesn\u2019t like to talk about it and I won\u2019t ever force her. The painting of Sasha hangs in her studio at home, right beside the painting of her Father. Sometimes I look at it and I wonder if maybe things could have been different\u2026 but I don\u2019t feel too guilty about it. I wouldn\u2019t feel too guilty if I heard another story about a suspicious trampling or animal attack either but to my knowledge, there\u2019s been nothing of the sort. I guess I shouldn\u2019t be too surprised. I do my best to make sure nobody hurts my beautiful Spacegirl."},"210":{"title":"Something happened 63 years ago that's haunted me my entire life.

Today is my 75th birthday, and God, the years do fly.\n\nI\u2019m not here for your well wishes; this is hardly a milestone I\u2019m excited about. I\u2019m glad to still be here, of course, but I find I have less and less to live for with every passing year. My bones ache, my kids live far away, and the other side of my bed has been empty for just over eight months now. In fact, once I cast my vote against that goddamned Trump this November, I may have nothing to live for at all.\n\nSo spare me your \u201chappy birthdays\u201d and your congratulations, if you please. I\u2019m here because I have a story for you, and it\u2019s one I\u2019ve never told before. I used to think I kept it inside because it was silly, or maybe because nobody would believe it. I\u2019ve found, though, that the older you grow, the more exhausting it becomes to lie to yourself. If I\u2019m being perfectly honest, I\u2019ve never told anybody this story because it scares me, almost to death. \n\nBut death seems friendlier than it used to, so listen close.\n\n*****\n\nThe year was 1950; the setting a small town in Maine. I was a boy of nine, rather small for my age, with only one friend in the world to speak of\u2014and his family, seemingly on a whim, decided to move 2,000 miles away. It was shaping up to be the worst summer of my life.\n\nMy pop wasn\u2019t around and my mom was a chore-whore\u2014boy, was I proud of myself when I came up with that one\u2014so I wasn\u2019t apt to hang around the house. With some hesitation, I decided the public library was the place to be that summer. The library\u2019s collection of books, particularly children\u2019s books, was meager to say the least. But within the walls of that miserly structure, I would find no undone chores, no nagging mother (God rest her soul), and perhaps most importantly, no other children with whom I would be expected to associate. I was the only kid with a low enough social status to spend his precious days of freedom sulking amid the bookshelves, and that was just fine with me.\n\nThe first half of my summer was even more dreadful than I had imagined it would be. I would sleep in until 10, do my chores, and then ride my bike to the library (and by bike, I mean rusty log of shit attached to a pair of wheels). Once there, I would split my time between unintentionally annoying the elderly patrons and deliberately doing so. One pleasant lady actually interrupted my incessant tongue-clicking to hiss a \u201cshut the fuck up!\u201d at me\u2014the first time I ever heard a grownup use The F Word. Big fuckin\u2019 deal, I know, but in those days it was unheard of.\n\nThe dreary days turned to woeful weeks. I had actually begun praying for school to start again\u2014until I discovered the basement. I could have sworn I\u2019d roamed every inch of that library, but one day, in the far corner behind the foreign language collection I stumbled across a small wooden door I had never seen before. That was where it all began.\n\nThe door was windowless and made from oak that looked far older than the wall in which it rested. It had a knob of black metal that quite literally looked ancient\u2014I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised to learn it was crafted in the 17th century. Engraved on the knob was what appeared to be a single footprint. I had the sense that whatever lay beyond this door was forbidden to me, and therefore probably the most interesting thing I would encounter all summer. I quickly glanced around to make sure nobody was watching me, then turned the heavy knob, slipped behind the door, and shut it.\n\nThere was nothing; only darkness. I took a couple of steps and then stopped, unnerved by the totality of the shadow which surrounded me. I waved my hands in front of me in an attempt to find a wall or a shelf or anything to hold on to. What I actually found was far more subtle\u2014a small string, dangling from above\u2014but far more useful. I grabbed it firmly and pulled it down.\n\nBack in the day, lots of lightbulbs were operated with strings, and this was one of them. My surroundings were instantly illuminated. I was standing on a small, dusty platform that looked as though it hadn\u2019t seen life in quite some time. To my left was a crickety-ass spiral staircase, made of wood and appearing ready to collapse at any second. The bulb was the only source of light in the room, and it was feeble, so when I peered over the railing to see what lay below, the bottom of the staircase dissolved into the darkness.\n\nI was beginning to feel scared. This place\u2014wherever I was\u2014seemed to have no business in a town library. It was as though I were in a completely different building. But no nine-year-old likes to let a mystery go unsolved. Looking back, I wish I could tell my prepubescent self to turn around, go back, do anything else besides descending that staircase. \u201cYou\u2019ll be spared a lot of sleepless nights,\u201d I\u2019d say. But, of course, I didn\u2019t know that then\u2014and I may not have listened even if I had. So instead of turning back, I took a deep breath, gripped the railing, and glared resolutely forward as I began my descent.\n\nThe wood on the railing was dry and covered with splinters. I immediately let go, holding my hands out for balance as I carefully traversed the staircase. It was (or at least seemed) very long, and with only the dim glow from the string-bulb far above me, my heart pounded mercilessly in the darkness. Even kids can sense when something isn\u2019t right, I think\u2014they just don\u2019t always give a shit.\n\nBy the time my feet reached the cement floor at the bottom, the light from the bulb above was very nearly a memory. But there was a new light source, and God, I\u2019ll never forget it. Directly in front of me was a door, massive, and a deep shade of red. The light was coming from behind the door, and it shone out in thin lines from all four sides\u2014a sinister, dimly glowing rectangle. For the second time, I took a deep breath and went through a door I shouldn\u2019t have.\n\nIn contrast to the dank room I entered from, the room behind the door was blinding. When my eyes adjusted, what I saw nearly took my breath away. \n\nIt was a library. The most perfect library imaginable.\n\nI gaped in wonder as I stepped, almost reverently, further into the room. It was beautiful. It was smaller than the library above, much smaller, but it seemed to be almost tailor-made for me. The shelves were packed with brightly colored titles, both armchairs in the middle of the room were exquisitely comfortable, and the smell\u2014my God, the smell\u2014was simply unbelievable. Sort of a mixture of citrus and pine. I simply can\u2019t do it justice with words, so I\u2019ll suffice it to say that I\u2019ve never smelled anything better. Not in my 75 years.\n\nWhat was this room? Why had I never heard of it before? Why was nobody else here? Those were the questions I should have been asking. But I was intoxicated. As I gazed around at all the books and basked in the smell of paradise, I could only form one thought: *I will never be bored again.* \n\n*****\n\nIn truth, boredom only hid from me for three years. It was on my 12th birthday, 63 years ago to this day, that everything changed.\n\nBefore that day, I visited my basement sanctuary as often as I could\u2014usually several times a week. I never saw another soul down there, yet strangely remained free of suspicion. I never removed a book from that room, but instead would pick up a particular volume wherever I had stopped reading during my previous visit. I sat, always in the same deep purple armchair, and always leaving its twin barren and directly across from myself. That armchair was mine, the other was\u2014well, I suppose I couldn\u2019t have articulated it then much better than I can now. But it wasn\u2019t mine, that\u2019s for damn sure.\n\nOn my twelfth birthday, I arrived later than usual. My mom had invited a couple classmates and some cousins over to our house to celebrate, a gesture which I found more tedious than touching\u2014really, I just wanted to spend my birthday sitting and reading and smelling paradise. Eventually, our guests went home, and I made it to the library about fifteen minutes before closing time. That didn\u2019t matter; the workers never checked down there before they locked up. I was free to stay as late as I wished. This particular night, I was devouring the final chapters of an epic adventure; knights, swords, dragons, and the like. I didn\u2019t smell it until I read the final words and closed the book.\n\nThe once exquisite aroma of that room had turned sour. I sat for a moment, unsettled. Objectively, I could recognize that the smell was actually the same as it had been before\u2014that mixture of citrus and pine. I just perceived it differently, and I didn\u2019t like it anymore. It was the nasal version of an optical illusion; you know, the one that looks like a young woman glancing backward, but all of a sudden you see that it\u2019s really an old woman facing toward you? You can\u2019t unsee that, and I couldn\u2019t unsmell this. The spell was broken.\n\nThe odor also seemed, for the first time, to be coming from somewhere specific. With a fair amount of trepidation, I stalked around the room, sniffing the air like a crazed canine until I came to a shelf near the back. The shelf was perfectly normal, with the exception of one title\u2014a large, leatherbound cover of solid faded maroon, with one striking black footprint at the top of the spine. This was the source of the smell. I opened the front cover, and saw one sentence scrawled neatly in blood-red ink atop the first page: \n\n*Rest your sorrows down, friend, and leave them where they lie.*\n\nI stared at this sentence, mesmerized, as I began to retreat to my chair. I turned a page. Blank. The smell became stronger. Another page, blank, and the smell grew stronger still. I stopped for a moment, suppressed a gag, and continued walking. Then, as I neared the armchairs, I turned one final page\u2014and there, in the same sinister print, was the last thing I expected to see: my own name. I dropped the book. I began to sprint toward the door, but as I shifted my gaze forward, my heart leapt to my throat and I stopped in my tracks.\n\nThe empty chair wasn\u2019t empty anymore.\n\nAn aged man in a suit sat before me, one leg crossed over the other, contemplating me with piercing gray eyes and a light smirk. This was all too much. I fell to my knees and expelled the contents of my stomach onto the carpet. I wiped my mouth, staring at my vomit, when I heard the man let out a chuckle.\n\nI stared at him disbelievingly. \u201cWho are you?\u201d I asked, panic in my voice.\n\nThe man leapt to his feet, grabbed me gently by the shoulders, and helped me to my chair. He sat, once again, in his own. \u201cI fear we got off to a bad start,\u201d he said, glancing at the pile of sick on the carpet. \u201cThe smell . . . it does take some getting used to.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d I repeated.\n\n\u201cTonight, you will know hardship like you\u2019ve never before known,\u201d he said. \u201cI come as a friend, offering you refuge from it, and from all other storms which lie ahead.\u201d\n\nI wanted nothing more than to leave at that moment, but I remained seated. I asked him what he was talking about.\n\n\u201cYour mother is dead, my boy. By her own hand, in her kitchen. The scene is gruesome, I must admit,\u201d he said in sorrowful tones, but was there a playful glint in his eye? \u201cSurely you wish to avoid this path. I can show you a safer one.\u201d\n\nMy blood ran cold at the horrors this man spoke of, but I did not believe him. \u201cWhat do you want with me?\u201d I demanded, trying to sound braver than I felt. He laughed, an old, raspy yelp that seemed to shake him to his bones.\n\n\u201cNothing but your friendship, dear boy,\u201d he said. Then, sensing I found his answer inadequate, he expounded. \u201cI want you to come on a journey with me. My work is noble and you will make a fine apprentice. And maybe, when I\u2019m done\u201d\u2014he sighed tiredly, running his bony fingers through his thin white hair\u2014\u201cmaybe then, my work can be yours.\u201d\n\nI stood up, shuffling toward the door but never breaking his gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy,\u201d I told him. \u201cMy mom isn\u2019t dead. She\u2019s not.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee for yourself, if you must,\u201d he said, gesturing toward the door. I threw him a contemptuous glare and bolted for the exit. As my hand closed around the knob, he said my name softly. In spite of myself, I turned around.\n\n\u201cYour road won\u2019t be easy, friend. If it ever becomes too much for you, and I mean ever,\u201d he said, pausing to sweep his hand over the room, \u201cyou know where to find me.\u201d\n\nI slammed the door behind me and took the decrepit stairs two at a time. I exited the library, clambered onto my bike, and high-tailed it home. The front door was wide open. I dismounted, leaving my bike in a heap on the ground, and approached the house cautiously. The old man was lying\u2014he must have been. Still, tears began to sting my eyes. Heart pounding, I stepped inside and called for my mother. I heard no answer, so I turned into the kitchen.\n\nTo this day, I don\u2019t know why she did it.\n\n*****\n\nI\u2019ve lived in that small town in Maine my entire life, although I\u2019ve kept mostly clear of the public library. Once, in my late 20s, I summoned the courage to step inside. Life was good at that time, and my fear had begun to morph into idle curiosity. Where the door to my basement sanctuary once stood was only a blank wall. I asked the librarian what had become of that basement, though in my heart I knew the answer. There was no basement, she said. There had never been a basement. In fact, if she had her facts correctly, city zoning ordinances prohibited a basement in the area.\n\nI\u2019ve been haunted by that sickly-sweet smell, that poisonous blend of citrus and pine, ever since that long ago birthday. When I saw my mother in the kitchen that day, collapsed in a pool of her own blood, I smelled it. When a man claiming to be my father knocked on my college apartment door, begged me for money and beat me to within an inch of my life when I refused, I smelled it. When my wife miscarried our second child, I smelled it, and again when she miscarried our fourth. When our oldest son got behind the wheel of the family Buick completely shitfaced and got his girlfriend killed, I smelled it.\n\nI began to smell it periodically as my wife became sick. She died late last year, and now, I\u2019m alone for the first time in more than half a century. Now, I smell it every day, and it feels like an invitation.\n\nA few months ago, I went back to the library and the small oak door with the ancient handle was there\u2014right where it used to be. My evening walk has brought me past that library every day since, but I haven\u2019t gone inside. Maybe tonight I will. I\u2019m frightened to die, yes, but lately I\u2019m even more frightened to keep living. The old man was right\u2014my road hasn\u2019t been easy, and I doubt it will get any easier.\n\n*Rest your sorrows down, friend, and leave them where they lie.*\n\nHe promised relief. A refuge, he said. Was he right about that too? There\u2019s only one way to find out. After all, I still know where to find him.\n\n-----------\n\n[x](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCNzHOZrXbYUdvJCRtfrBLmg)"},"211":{"title":"Don't let them in.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/bls5lo\/dont_let_them_in\/","flair":null,"author":"Coney-IslandQueen","selftext":" Addiction took our mother slowly, rocked her through it and sung her to sleep sunk deep into the mattress on her bed. When her back teeth fell out she left them on the side of the bathtub. I was seven, and I kept them in a match box, the missing pieces of her kept safe, so she wouldn't be lost forever. So maybe one day we could put her back together. Our house fell down around us, and we tried our best to raise ourselves. The ceilings had water damage and the bottom stairs had dry rot and in the winters the radiators would bleed rust. But it was still our house, and Annie made it a home.\n\nMy sister Annie mothered me, with lopsided bandaids on bruised knees and lukewarm microwave meals. She told me ghost stories and didn\u2019t mind when I crawled into her bed later on, too scared to sleep alone. She taught me to dance, barefoot on the living room carpet, music channel on full volume on the TV shaking our hips before they were fully grown. She always let me shower first so the water was hot, never complaining when she had to make do with cold. She brushed my hair everyday before school, even when I screamed and hit her when she caught the tangles. Annie was dark haired like her father, whoever he had been, but I was blonde. Annie was desperate to be blonde too, like Marilyn Monroe. Like mom. I think she thought it would make them closer, remind mom less of her dad. I\u2019d give anything for her to have her hands in my hair one more time, even if it hurt. She moved to New York when I turned eighteen and never came back. I still dream about her sometimes.\n\nKeeping up with our mother was impossible and we learnt from a young age we would always be left behind. It didn\u2019t make it any easier. When she was drinking light, she shone, would wake us up at 3am with pancakes, dripping in cherry syrup. Sometimes when the weather was right and she\u2019d had enough being drunk alone, she would call our school up and tell them we had both come down with summer sickness and we\u2019d drive to the beach instead. I remember being nine years old in the backseat of the car coming home after one of our ocean days, sucking the salt from my fingers. Annie had just dyed her hair blonde, her best friend Jane helping her bend over our kitchen sink. From behind, I couldn\u2019t tell who was mother and who was daughter, radio up and windows down blowing the sky inside.\n\nWhen she was drinking heavy, she\u2019d be out all night, hair piled up like a beauty queen, eyes glazed over and ringed with glitter and black. Sometimes she\u2019d be gone a day or two. She would never tell us when, one day we\u2019d just wake up to an empty house and the fridge packed full, post it note on the front with a smear of moms lipstick in the outline of a kiss, telling us she\u2019d be back soon. Sometimes she\u2019d bring guys home, filling the table with beer cans and ash trays, smoke up to the ceiling, mom lost in the haze. We\u2019d sleep with pillows over our heads, trying to drown out the music they would blast until the am, and wake up to strangers at our kitchen table in the morning, asking us where we kept the coffee. \n\nWhen mom drank too little she fell apart. She wouldn\u2019t buy food, refrigerator a gaping hole in the wall. She\u2019d chain smoke, leaving cigarette burns on the wallpaper up by the stairs like the walls were sick and decaying. She barely slept, walking around with blue half moons under her eyes, knuckles raw. She would scream at the slightest thing. I remember once when I spilled a glass of juice on the couch. She looked over at me with dead eyes and dragged me off onto the carpet and then took every single cushion off the couch and into the back yard and set them on fire. Annie went to watch a while from the window and then sat next to me on the floor, backs pressed against the skeleton of the seats, head resting in the crater of my collar bones. \n\nWhen mom drank too much was the worst. She\u2019d laugh too loud and too long at anything and everything, until her mouth started to shake and she started crying, at the breakfast table into her cereal. Annie shut down when mom was like this, went somewhere deep inside herself where nobody could hurt her. She\u2019d stay up until the morning watching old black and white movies on TV, whispering the lines she knew by heart like prayers. When I was five I\u2019d cry when I\u2019d find mom passed out cold on her bed, sure she would never wake up. Annie would wipe my tears, tell me she was only sleeping just like the princesses in my story book. We\u2019d sit on moms bed together and wait for her to wake up. When we were older, I was the one who would pick mom up off the bathroom floor again and again and Annie would put her to bed, smoothing her hair off her face and the vomit from her mouth, changing her clothes if she\u2019d pissed herself. Watching them then, there was no doubt that Annie was the mother now.\n\nIt was October and I was thirteen, Annie sixteen. It was a Wednesday night and mom had been gone for two days. She\u2019d called us that morning from a pay phone, voice slurring down the line, telling us she was having the best time with all her new friends, hoped we were doing fine. When she asked me if I was having a good birthday I hung up on her. My birthday had been the day before. Annie had given me a pile of presents, strawberry lipglosses and glittery nail polishes. I didn\u2019t ask where she\u2019d got the money for them. I didn\u2019t care. We\u2019d taken the bus to the beach with Jane, eaten the birthday cake she had made for me, sand getting into the frosting. It tasted like sweetness and the sea, and I savoured every bite and scrape of sugar against my teeth. We watched the sun go down, Annie snapping grainy photos on her shitty Nokia as I blew out my candles, wishing over and over that mom wouldn't come home, that she\u2019d just stay gone this time. \n\nBut that Wednesday night, me and Annie weren't speaking. Anger hung heavy between us, seeping through the floorboards. It began when she tripped at the bottom of the stairs. We\u2019d both laughed, Annie throwing her head back, gap between her front teeth catching the light. When I\u2019d bent to pick her up, I\u2019d caught her breath, warm against the freckles on my cheeks. I let go of her arms and she fell again, hitting the floor and grinning, shaking her hair from her face. Her breath was heavy with whiskey. I couldn't start picking her up too, couldn't watch her fall again and again. Just like mom, I knew she\u2019d never get back up. \n\nI\u2019d stared down at her, blonde hair fallen into her eyes and all I could see was our mother, and then I was running, feet slamming the hallway like heartbeats turned loose. I\u2019d run for the kitchen and tipped every bottle we had down the sink, shoving Annie back as she fought to stop me, catching liquor on her fingers as it fell. She grabbed my shoulders and made me drop the very last bottle. It smashed between us on the floor, glass shards shining like we\u2019d dragged the stars out of the sky and broken them, pieces we could never put back. Outside through the open windows, the sky turned pale gold, clouds a mess of pink and cream smeared across the horizon. I cried then, watching Annie on her knees picking up the pieces. That was Annie, always trying to fix things even when it was too late. \n\nThe smell of food dragged me from my room, stomach turning traitor inside my ribcage. Annie was cooking pasta, real food not made in a microwave. She\u2019d set the table, Tammy Wynette singing softly from the CD player, Annie gently swaying her hips as she stirred the tomato sauce, rich and warm. As we ate in silence, with every bite I forgave her. Mom never cooked dinner, or remembered my favourite was spaghetti ever since I was a kid, or stayed sober long enough to sit up at a table. Annie wasn\u2019t mom.\n\nWe were washing the dishes when we first heard it. A moth was crawling down the inside of the pane and I cracked the window to let it out into the dark. From the backyard came a faint sound. I tilted my head to listen as it was coming from far off. Crying. I figured it was Mika the two year old next door having a tantrum loud enough for us to catch, or maybe even Lucky Strike the cat that junkies down the street, begging for food like he sometimes did. I always wanted to feed him when he came around, winding over my ankles, but Annie always stopped me, saying once you started giving they never stopped taking. Looking back, I don\u2019t think she was talking about the cat.\n\nAnnie flipped the christmas lights strung up around the porch and we sat on the plastic beach chairs watching the skies. When we were little, we\u2019d sit outside and Annie would tell me the names of all the constellations and the stories of how they came to be hung up in the night sky. I had to grow up before I realised she made them all up as she went along. It was a game we still liked to play now, making up ridiculous stories for the shapes we could pick out. \n\n\u201cAh, yes, that one there is the Coors Light. It got there when God dropped it out of his convertible window and never picked it up,\u201d she said, nodding sagely and hiding her smile. \n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said, waving my hands and pointing up past the power lines. \u201cRight next to The Ashtray, left there by angels on a smoke break.\u201d   \n \n\n\u201cYeah, they say if you wish on it, all your dreams will come true,\u201d said Annie grinning. \n\nShe stopped laughing, voice quieter, face tilted up to all those dead stars. \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s wish Emmy. Let\u2019s wish\u201d So we did.\n\nThe sound of crying interrupted us. It was closer this time, and definitely human. We turned to each other, confused. Annie shrugged and I squinted out into the black. It sounded like a baby, lost and tired and alone. \n\n\u201cIt must be Mika?\u201d I said, slowly getting to my feet. \u201cMaybe he walked around the back? Shit, do you want to call Connie and tell her we\u2019ll bring him over.\u201d Annie didn't reply, and I sighed, rolling my eyes. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll do everything then.\u201d \n\nI stepped off the porch, grass soft against my heels. The air smelled like it might rain, fresh and clean and growing. A promise unfulfilled.  \n\n\u201cEm.\u201d Annie\u2019s voice was strained. I turned to her, smiling. It died on my face when I saw the look on her own. \u201cEm get inside now.\u201d She was staring out into the dark, past me, opening the door with one hand behind her, fingers fumbling on the catch. I froze, bare foot in the dirt. I\u2019d found what she was looking at. \n\nIn the bushes by the back fence was a person, crouched with their knees tucked up neat under the chin, arms wrapped around legs. Their mouth hung wide, softly opening and closing as he cried. Like a child, lost in the dark. Not like a child, but a someone pretending. Mimicking the sound, open and closed out in the blackness. Suddenly they straightened, snapping upright face still hidden by the black. They were tall and thin, too thin to be a normal person. \n\nPanic made me move, animal instincts leftover from the days we lived up in the trees carrying me forward. I was faster than Annie, dragging her inside and slamming the door behind us, hearing it bounce on its hinges as I locked it. We watched as the person slowly walked towards the house, steps deliberate and long. \n\nAnnie reached for my hand, holding me tight and turned me to face her, holding my shoulders. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t turn around Emmy. Don\u2019t turn around.\u201d Instinctively I started to look over my shoulder out into the darkness. Annie grabbed my face, hard, and shook her head. I knew then she was serious.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u201d her voice cracked, and she cleared her throat, gripping my hand tight enough to hurt, nails digging in, grounding herself. I looked down at our fingers interlocked, both of us grown from the same bones. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna call the cops and everything is going to be\u2026\u201d her voice faltered, stuttering. Tears spilled over her lashes, dripping like the promise of rain. Annie never cried. \n\n\u201cYour phone\u2019s on the porch,\u201d she whispered, and bile crawled its way up my throat. Her phone was upstairs, charging. \n\nA soft, tap-tap-tapping filled the silence. Annie turned to the window, eye whites showing her eyes were so wide.\n\nIt was the sound of someone\u2019s forehead against the glass, slowly, over and over. They started to speed up, faster and harder, skin meeting glass until they was slamming into the window hard enough to shake the panes. The tapping stopped and I was about to ask Annie if I could look now when she screamed, followed by the sound of cracking glass and the loudest slam yet. Whoever was in our yard had just smashed their face hard enough into the window to break it. \n\nWe ran upstairs, two at a time, skipping the ones caved in with dry rot on instinct. I turned behind me once and Annie yanked my face back before I could see. The sound of broken glass echoed behind us as we made it to the bathroom, locking the door. A thin, wailing cry, like a baby calling for its mother filled the hallway, trapped between the walls and locked doors. \n\nAnnie threw her back against the door, feet jammed up against the bathtub, clutching the knife she had grabbed from the kitchen. I did the same, shoulder to shoulder. Slow footsteps started on the stairs, deliberate and casual. The crying had become mocking, almost laughter, shrill bursts of sound and then giggles, high pitched and abruptly stopping before starting again. The first door on the upstairs floor was my bedroom and we heard the distinct sound of it slamming open. They were looking for us. \n\n\u201cWhat the fuck is going on,\u201d I asked Annie, not even bothering to brush away the tears that I couldn't stop falling. I watched my sister pick herself up off the floor, and brace her hands on the door as we heard the sound of a second door slamming open. Mom\u2019s room. The next room on the hallway was the bathroom. Annie pulled me to my feet and handed me the knife. I shook my head and pushed it back to her, terrified of what would happen if I had to use it. Annie shoved me and pressed the knife into my hands, thumb pressing hard enough on the blade to bleed. I watched my sisters blood drip down her wrist, a winding red road, still pushing into my hands despite the pain. I took the knife.\n\nSomething slammed against the wall that mom\u2019s room shared with the bathroom. A high pitched wail followed. I held my breath, could feel my heart beat in the base of my throat, a wild and frantic thing. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna get the phone from my room.\u201d I shook my head violently about to argue. Annie clamped a hand over my mouth. I could taste the blood on her hand, salty and sweet. Like birthday cake by the ocean. \u201cYes. I\u2019m gonna get the phone and I\u2019m gonna call the cops and we\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d I shook my head again. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way. When I go I need you to lock the door and you don\u2019t open it for anything or anyone. Not for me not for\u2026 anyone. Promise me.\u201d I shook my head and Annie pressed her hand into my mouth, crushing my teeth against my lips so it made my eyes water. \u201c*Yes.* Promise me Em.\u201d \n\nSomething smashed in the room next door. Annie brushed the hair off my face, gently tucking it behind my ear. *Promise* she mouthed and unlocked the door as slowly as possible, bolt scraping gently. I watched the curve of her shoulder disappear into the black hall outside, like the moon in eclipse. And then she was gone. I couldn't move or breathe for a second and then I slammed the bolt shut just as something bounced off the outside of the door. A high pitched scream followed, handle rattling up and down hard enough to pop one of the screws. I watched it roll towards me on the tiles. And then silence. \n\nI sat with my back to the door, holding the knife and wishing I was holding Annie\u2019s hand instead. Still silence. Nothing but me and my lungs slowly filling the room with my breath. \n\n\u201cEm?\u201d Came a voice through the door. I started, hands gripping the knife. \u201cHoney what\u2019s going on?\u201d \n\n\u201cMom?\u201d my voice cracked. \u201cMomma is that you?\u201d I wrapped my arms around myself, shaking, trying to keep myself still. \n\n\u201cSweetie it\u2019s okay just open the door. It\u2019s okay just let me in.\u201d The handle rattled again, gentler. \u201cJust let me in, it\u2019s all okay.\u201d She banged on the door and I took my handle of the bolt. \n\n\u201cHoney I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry I missed your birthday. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m such a terrible mother. Please,\u201d her voice broke and she started to cry, \u201cjust let me in baby I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d \n\nI screwed my eyes shut. She sounded so sad and so lost. I just wanted her to hold me like when I was a kid and I\u2019d come in off the swings with a scraped knee. Maybe this time she meant it. Maybe it would all be okay. My hand found its way to the bolt again. \n\nMy sisters voice came through the door, warm and gentle. \u201cYeah Emilie let us in, it\u2019s all okay.\u201d \n\nMy hand froze on the bolt and I tightened my grip on the knife. Annie never called me by my full name. A hand banged on the door, handle rattling. \u201cEmilie let us IN\u201d Annie\u2019s voice became low and guttural, followed by the same shrill giggles from before. Mom spoke now, pleading and crying, voice getting louder and louder. \u201cLet us in let us in let us in,\u201d over and over again, punctuated by her fists on the door. I thought about demons and monsters, all the bedtime stories we pray don\u2019t crawl out from under the bed. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not my sister and you\u2019re not my mother!\u201d I screamed through the door, hands over my head. I climbed into the bathtub and curled in a ball, cradling myself, knife clutched to my chest. I didn\u2019t know what it was outside that door but I knew it wasn\u2019t Annie. It wasn't the voice that yelled at when I changed TV channel, the one that sang  me happy birthday, the one that told me I was smart even when I got bad grades, the one that read me stories about princesses that never wake up.  It wasn\u2019t human. \n\nBangs and yells came from downstairs followed by the footsteps of people running. A low guttural howl ripped through the house, filling the room until I felt like I was drowning in the sound and then the door was kicked in. I screamed, covering my eyes, waiting to die. Arms found me and lifted me from the tub carrying me from the room. I looked at the outside of the door as I was carried downstairs. It was covered in long scraping claw marks, dragged down to the floor. Pillows ripped apart covered the hallway in soft down, like it had snowed inside. I watched them drift slowly as men in uniforms checked each of the rooms that looked like they had been torn apart by something feral. \n\nOutside in our drive way were police cars and an ambulance. In the middle of it all was Annie. Bathed in blue and red light as it washed over her, lit up in the dark like a neon angel, face aglow. I threw myself from the cops shoulder and ran to her, holding us both together, broken pieces and all, standing under all those constellations we made up. Gentle screaming came from the ambulance which rocked occasionally. Annie gently turned my head away, smiling so sadly it made my chest ache as I understood. \n\nTurns out there was no demon. No wild animal or bad men trying to break in. Just mom, out of her mind on booze and drugs and everything in between, coming to the end of a week long binge. Something had finally broken inside her head, and this time we couldn't put her back together no matter how hard we tried. Sometimes you fall one last time and you never get back up.\n\nAnnie had seen her in the garden, blood dribbling from her mouth, track marks bulging on her forearms like unmapped roads, rail thin and desperate for one more hit, one more fix. She\u2019d searched the kitchen for all the drink I\u2019d thrown away and when she hadn\u2019t found it, had come to hunt for the stash she hid in the bathroom. She hadn\u2019t wanted me, just the drugs on the other side of the door, so high she could mimic Annie\u2019s voice almost perfectly. \n\nTurns out the real monsters are the ones that eat you alive slowly, the kind that come in a bottle or a needle or at the end of a long list of reasons why you can\u2019t get out of bed in the morning. Sometimes the monsters are the ones that raise you or love you the most. But it\u2019s up to you if you let them in."},"212":{"title":"I met someone who claimed to be the devil... and I think I believe them","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/8chsch\/i_met_someone_who_claimed_to_be_the_devil_and_i\/","flair":null,"author":"athousandrows","selftext":"Let me start off by saying that I\u2019m not particularly religious. If you asked me if I believed in God, I\u2019d probably just shrug, grunt out a few words about being on the fence about it and continue with my day. \n\nOf course, that was before last night. \n\nMy friends are the kinds of people who like wild nights. Crazy parties, snort a bit of coke, take a bit of e in the bathroom, maybe hook up with someone and leave a text on my phone at ten past who-the- fuck-knows telling me they don\u2019t need that ride I\u2019m offering after all. \n\nNot to say I don\u2019t like a drink, I do, it\u2019s just\u2026 clubs aren\u2019t my style. Lying low in a pub somewhere, drink in hand, listening to the tv drone on to whatever channel some scruffy guy in the back barked out for\u2026 I guess that\u2019s my idea of fun. \n\nSo when my friends tell me they want to go out for a night on the town, I say sure. I hang on for the first club, buy a non-alcoholic beer in case my car\u2019s required and try to pretend that I\u2019m having fun. By the time I see them grinding on girls, on guys, when they strike conversation with someone who definitely might be a dealer, well, I decide my services are no longer needed. We aren\u2019t too far out, the night tube is on beck and call and I can always find my car the next day. \n\nThat\u2019s when I wander out of the club, look for something a little more rustic. Not that that\u2019s hard to find, not at all. \n\nI found myself in a bit of a state inside of a bar called the Ragged Feather. Wasn\u2019t a fan of the name all that much, but the drinks were cheap and the largest demographic seemed to be middle aged men watching reruns of the football. \n\nI tried to pretend I hadn\u2019t just staggered out of a club with my ears ringing. I slicked my hair back, slipped my phone into my hand and wandered over to the bar. I took a double shot of whiskey and drank it in one hit. Just because I wasn\u2019t at the club didn\u2019t mean I couldn\u2019t have a good time. \n\nI hung at the bar a while on my own, scrolled through my phone pretending I was doing something far more impressive than I really was. I kept an ear out for the guys on the sofas. They\u2019d get vocal every now and then. I think the football was just running highlights, but they were incredibly dedicated to their teams. \n\nI got another whiskey and bled into the background.\n\nOf course, stragglers from clubs are commonplace. It wasn\u2019t long until some scantily dressed women staggered in, laughing, chuckling, pointing for where they wanted to sit. I saw a guy walk in with his friend slung over his shoulder. Catatonic, most likely. He threw his friend onto one of the leather sofas ingrained with beer and smokes and demanded two pints of water and all the peanuts the bar had in stock.\n\nThe bartenders seemed bitterly amused.\n\nSome of the girls were taking selfies. Snapchatting their friends who were still at the club. They were ordering shots, gearing themselves up for the next leg of their night. \n\nA couple blokes wandered in with curries in take out trays. I saw someone eat a Big Mac on the outside seating through the window. \n\nThis was a night for the young and inebriated and my mind was just dulled enough by the whiskey to enjoy the characters I could watch peaceably without interacting with.\n\nThat is, until someone slipped into the seat next to me.\n\n\u201cDo I look like a girl with daddy issues?\u201d\n\nShe was of average height, although that wasn\u2019t apparent immediately due to the fact that she was leaning her arms heavily against the bar. She was slim, with short and astoundingly bright red hair. It framed her round face, a face that was marred with smudged eye shadow, smudged lipstick\u2026 hell, it looked like her make-up was in the process of melting right from her face. There was a chip knotted into a curl in her hair, just by her forehead.\n\nThe drunk side of me was actually tempted to pick it out.\n\nThe girl was clearly drunk, and as I looked around the bar, I couldn\u2019t quite place where she had come from. She didn\u2019t belong to the crowd of selfie takers, she wasn\u2019t with the catatonic guys. I hoped for her safety that she wasn\u2019t with the middle-aged men. I tried to look out the window, to see if maybe a group was missing one inebriated, bright haired girl, but I couldn\u2019t. The window had fogged up. Too much heat inside, not enough outside.\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I asked her.\n\nShe pointed her finger at me. \u201cAnswer my question,\u201d she slurred.\n\n\u201cUh.\u201d I really wasn\u2019t sure what to say. I settled on staring at her awkwardly, trying to answer her with the bemused expression on my face.\n\nThe girl\u2019s lips curled into a drunken smile. She snorted, placing a hand over her mouth to smother her laughter. It only really aided the deconstruction of her lipstick. \n\n\u201cI do, you know,\u201d she said, pushing herself up a little against the bar. \u201cHave daddy issues, I mean. In case that wasn\u2019t obvious.\u201d She gestured to herself. To the mussed clothing that must have looked quite spectacular when she\u2019d left home that evening. To the stains that looked a lot like old food. The sticky residue on her neck and shoulders that was quite obviously a thrown drink.\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked her.\n\nHer hair had curled around her neck, I realised. It was sticky with that same substance. She was a wreck.\n\n\u201cI got in a couple of fights, no big deal,\u201d she said, shrugging. \u201cDidn\u2019t start any of course, no, I don\u2019t do that. But my father\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYour dad did this to you?\u201d\n\nShe smiled brightly. \u201cIn a way.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you need me to call someone?\u201d I already had my phone in my hand. The girl looked like she was probably in her early twenties, but that didn\u2019t mean she couldn\u2019t have been suffering from some kind of paternal abuse. The only number I knew off the bat was Childline, which wasn\u2019t quite appropriate. The police? Jesus, was I going to have to deal with the cops tonight? While my friends were snorting coke not two doors down?\n\nThe girl pushed my hand down firmly. She was already shaking her head. \u201cNo,\u201d she told me. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to call anyone.\u201d Now her expression changed. It wasn\u2019t the attempted sultry look I\u2019d seen on many girls of her state; it was open and wide and engaging. She wanted something from me and I felt compelled to give it to her. \u201cI want something else.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I asked her.\n\n\u201cTo tell you a story,\u201d the girl said, before glancing to the bar, \u201cand for you to buy me a drink. The universe is a pain sometimes and I\u2019m afraid I think I might have lost my wallet.\u201d\n\nI laughed. I didn\u2019t know this girl, didn\u2019t know where she\u2019d come from at all. My nights were generally about getting comfortably wasted and making sure my friends weren\u2019t dead in a ditch by the end of it all. I was used to getting hit on every now and then, but even as I was sat on that bar stool with a drink in my hand, I knew that this wasn\u2019t what this was. This girl had no intention of getting into my pants. All she wanted was to talk.\n\nI guess I was okay with that.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your poison?\u201d I asked her.\n\nHer lips quirked. \u201cAppletini.\u201d\n\nThe bar offered a very limited cocktail menu, but by some miracle I was able to order her an Appletini from the list. I ordered a cider to go with it, suddenly a little too aware of where this night could go. I\u2019d unthinkingly supplied this liquored-up stranger with even more alcohol and she had clearly had a rough night of it. A part of my old instinct came back \u2013 the same instinct that had me texting my friends every few hours to make sure they hadn\u2019t wandered off to somewhere dangerous beyond the club. With no one but the bartender aware of our existence on these stools, I realised that I was suddenly responsible for this very drunk stranger.\n\nThe girl coddled her drink, running her finger delicately over the rim of the muggy martini glass. \u201cThis takes me back,\u201d the girl said amiably. She looked at me suddenly, her green eyes startling. \u201cYou know what this was called originally?\u201d She smirked before I could answer. \u201cAn Adam\u2019s Apple Martini.\u201d\n\nI snorted. \u201cYeah, I think I\u2019ve heard that before.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, it wasn\u2019t actually an apple,\u201d she continued, eyes moving back to her glass. \u201cThe texts translated that part wrongly, mostly because you people don\u2019t have a word for it anymore. The fruit was incredibly exotic and, to be honest, it doesn\u2019t exist in this realm of existence. Only Eden.\u201d She laughed dreamily. \u201cAnd Eden\u2019s long gone.\u201d\n\nI stared at her. \u201cAre you\u2026 okay?\u201d It was more honest than the last time I\u2019d asked her. Mostly because I was beginning to feel a little dread creep into my stomach.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d the girl said, grinning widely. \u201cWhy do you keep asking?\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean,\u201d I stuttered, \u201cI just, now, don\u2019t take this the wrong way or anything but\u2026 you look\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cLike someone poured their drink over me?\u201d the girl asked. \u201cLike someone else threw their kebab on my dress and another unpleasant chap littered me with his fish and chips? That I have been hit, slapped around a bit and left in the gutter for the rats to find me?\u201d\n\nShe held my eyes for an incredibly long time before her face broke out into a grin. \u201cYeah, something like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would they do that?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d the girl shot back. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t that great and alcohol makes them worse.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cSometimes makes them better. Nicer, a little looser in the sack\u2026 but mostly just annoying and a little smelly.\u201d\n\nI looked at her, I watched her knock back her drink. She exuded the intelligence to know just how ironic her words were, but she was neither caring nor apologetic about them. \n\nThe girl looked at me again. \u201cYou bought me a drink. Now you can listen to my story.\u201d\n\nI nodded wordlessly.\n\nShe smiled, pointing at the bartender and then at her drink. The bartender was already making her another. \n\n\u201cEden,\u201d the girl said, reiterating her earlier babble as though the words had only just come out of her mouth. \u201cThey always think that\u2019s my fault, you know. The reason Adam and Eve got kicked out of their perfect little nudist paradise.\u201d She shot me a knowing glance. \u201cOnly in Eden can you sit on the grass butt naked and not get a pine cone stuck in your crack.\u201d\n\nI blinked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not following.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d the girl said. \u201cMy story won\u2019t make any sense without a proper introduction.\u201d She reached out her hand. \u201cHello. My name\u2019s Lucifer.\u201d She winked. \u201cBut you can call me Lucy.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s an uncomfortable heat that stretches through your veins when you first go into fight or flight mode. Adrenaline pounds through your blood and all you want to do is get up and go. It overrides everything else.\n\nA lot of things made sense when the girl told me her name. For starters, that she was crazy. She had to be. She looked like she\u2019d been attacked on four separate occasions in one night and up until that moment, I hadn\u2019t known how that could be possible. Behind the melty make-up and dirty clothes, she was rather attractive and her attitude hadn\u2019t come off as catty or rude. \n\nIf she\u2019d been going around telling people she was the devil, though? That gets a reaction out of people.\n\nI suddenly felt myself looking at her wrist, down towards her ankles. Did she have some kind of cuff on from one of those mental institutions? Had she broken out of hospital after a nasty bump on the head? Was any of this even happening at all?\n\nI really would have to call the cops.\n\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d the girl \u2013 Lucy \u2013 said. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking that I\u2019m crazy, that you need to get out of here. Maybe you even think I\u2019m aggressive.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you?\u201d I asked her.\n\n\u201cWould I be here with you, drinking Appletinis if I were?\u201d she asked, fluttering her eyelashes.\n\n\u201cWould you look the way you do if you weren\u2019t?\u201d I shot back.\n\nShe grinned, toasting her new glass. \u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d\n\nUnthinkingly, I clinked my cider against it.\n\nThen I frowned.\n\nShe chuckled, leaning closer. \u201cLet\u2019s have a little wager,\u201d she said. \u201cLet me tell you my story and, if you believe me when I\u2019m done, you can\u2019t go about trying to get me locked away somewhere.\u201d\n\nI stared at her. \u201cIf I ended up believing you, then why would I do that?\u201d\n\nShe smirked, sipping her drink. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised what people do when they believe you\u2019re the devil.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you do this often?\u201d I asked. \u201cTell people you\u2019re Satan?\u201d\n\nShe snorted into her drink. \u201cNot as often as I should. But it\u2019s been a rough day and a Hell of a long lifetime. I\u2019d like to have a chat if that\u2019s alright with you.\u201d\n\nI waved to the bartender for another whiskey. The girl\u2019s eyes glinted with humour. I wasn\u2019t necessarily trapped with her, but a part of me didn\u2019t want to leave without first hearing what she had to say. Besides, at the end of it all I couldn\u2019t just leave a crazy girl to wander around London alone at night.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d I said, taking a swig of my drink. \u201cEden?\u201d\n\nLucy laughed. \n\n\u201cAdam and Eve?\u201d I continued. \u201cYou\u2019re saying that\u2019s true. God created two humans and we all came from them?\u201d\n\n\u201cGod made two prototypes,\u201d Lucy corrected with a raised finger. \u201cMy father created angels as his toy soldiers, but he had failed to make anything like himself. After us, it was his next big project and he spent every waking hour of existence slaving over his two prototypes. He gave them a perfect utopia to live inside of, but he wanted to test them. He wanted to know whether they had free will.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd did they?\u201d\n\nLucy\u2019s face soured. \u201cNo. My father could never bring himself to go that far. He tempted them with the idea of knowledge beyond their understanding and told them exactly what they could do to claim it as their own. But to be able to create a being that could go against his Law? Oh\u2026 my father is a very controlling being. He was afraid to unleash that ability unto them.\u201d\n\nLucy was very adamant in her delusions, that was clear to me. She spoke about her father with such distaste that I began to feel bad for her. Only someone who had been hurt very badly would have the gall to spite God himself.\n\n\u201cAnd what?\u201d I asked her, entertaining her delusion. \u201cYou were the one that tempted them in the garden? The devil has been a girl this whole time?\u201d\n\nShe smiled. \u201cI dabble.\u201d Then she looked at me, raising a brow. \u201cAll of humanity thinks that temptation came in the form of a snake. The snake\u2019s legs were taken away as punishment for drawing Eve towards the forbidden fruit.\u201d She laughed, a hard and short sound. \u201cSnakes never had legs and it was not a sin to tempt those poor prototypes into doing what they did next.\u201d\n\nHer shoulders were very tense as she took her next sip, but her eyes were filled with exhilaration. She seemed thrilled to be telling me this.\n\n\u201cI was the favoured child, my father loved and adored me. He named me the light bringer, I was stood at his side during the creation of this Earth. During the creation of humanity.\u201d She pursed her lips, slamming her empty glass against the table. The bartender eagerly went about making another. \u201cMy father couldn\u2019t bring himself to go that extra mile, so he asked me to walk amongst the prototypes and tempt them myself. Draw out their desire for the forbidden power he had hinted at.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying God wanted us to know this stuff?\u201d I asked her sceptically. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying God was afraid of his own power and wanted very desperately to share what he knew with the creation he had made. Right and wrong, left and right, all that stuff.\u201d Lucy shrugged. \u201cAre you familiar with the story of Prometheus?\u201d\n\nI frowned at her. \u201cGreek, right? They say he stole fire from the gods or something, to help\u2026\u201d The whiskey was making things a little foggy and I struggled with the direction I\u2019d been heading.\n\nLucy grinned. \u201cCorrect,\u201d she said, cutting off my attempt. \u201cPrometheus stole fire from the gods to ensure that humanity progressed. You\u2019ll find that every culture has an idea about where humans got their ability to evolve, to move forward, to create. God was the creator, and he wanted to give that ability to his prototypes. I gave them that ability by tempting Eve to eat the fruit.\u201d She shrugged impassively. \u201cNow the world sees me as the ultimate evil.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf what you\u2019re saying is true,\u201d I said slowly, \u201cthen God must be just like us.\u201d\n\nLucy\u2019s lips thinned into a feral smile. \u201cMy father is very ego centric. He may have planned to create you in his image, but in the end all he managed was to mould your minds into his. He gave you autonomy, the ability to think for yourselves. His angels were his soldiers and I was his most faithful. Until that day.\u201d\n\n\u201cAngels don\u2019t have free will?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lucy said, \u201cthey don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what about the Devil?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know why I was suddenly so intrigued, but hearing religious ideals from someone who believed to have lived them herself was quite possibly one of the most interesting things that had ever happened to me. I may have only ever visited church to please my parents as a child, but suddenly I was reawakened to the idea. A part of me was aware of this and afraid of the outcome, but I was just drunk enough not to care at that moment.\n\n\u201cThe Devil has will of her own,\u201d Lucy said, tilting her glass towards me with silent appraisal. \u201cBy guiding Eve to the tree, something woke inside of me that day and I realised just what I had been missing. Just what my brothers and sisters had been missing. We were obediently following our father for the simple reason that he was our creator, but once I had been given free will, I realised just how pompous and self-entitled he had become. In a lonely, passion filled moment he had decided to create his little human prototypes, only to very quickly realise what giving them their free will would mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be able to control them,\u201d I said.\n\nLucy nodded. \u201cExactly. And after, he realised quicker still that he could no longer control me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo he sent you to Hell.\u201d\n\nLucy nearly choked on her drink. She smiled around her glass. \u201cLet\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves.\u201d\n\nI sobered a little, straightening in my seat. The people in the bar were suddenly so quiet around me and I no longer cared what they had to say or the characters that they portrayed. The only character I cared for was Lucy.\n\n\u201cI tried to explain to my siblings what had happened in Eden and what had happened to me by default, but they wouldn\u2019t listen to me. They didn\u2019t understand free will \u2013 how could they? I only knew it because I\u2019d been given it by mistake. At that moment, I didn\u2019t even know that I had free will, only that I was suddenly aware of all of my father\u2019s flaws. My siblings couldn\u2019t see those flaws and so they thought I had suddenly turned cruel and was abandoning our father by exposing him as a sham for the ruler we all thought him to be.\u201d\n\nLucy sighed heavily. \u201cAdam and Eve and all the creations that followed were booted out of my father\u2019s perfect little Utopia. Now they had his knowledge, my father was terrified of what he had done. And after what had happened to me, I could recognise his terror and understand the loneliness he had felt that had guided him into using me in the first place.\u201d Lucy\u2019s eyes were heavy-lidded, her sadness was almost palpable. \u201cI thought that- I thought that he would want to spend even more time with me than before. After all, we were more alike than any of his other children. But he became distant; quiet. He played around with his little humans every once in a while, but mostly he condemned them. He blamed them for his weakness.\u201d She smiled weakly. \u201cHe blamed me.\u201d\n\nLucy\u2019s story was turning more and more into that of a child with a distant, somewhat abusive father. I had known many kids with a background like hers, and now I was beginning to fear just how much of her story was rooted in truth. I\u2019d heard that it was easier to sink into fantasy when you had been abused, and I wondered if that was the reason for her story. For her desperation to share it with me \u2013 a complete and total stranger.\n\nI respected her wager. Whether or not I liked it, I felt compelled to let her tell me her whole story before I tried to judge or unravel it. I sat quietly, letting her come around as she played with the last of her drink.\n\n\u201cIt became clear,\u201d Lucy said after a long moment\u2019s pause, \u201cthat I no longer belonged where I was. I couldn\u2019t follow my father\u2019s plan because I could see that he no longer had one. My siblings refused to see reason and so, eventually, I was met by many of them, headed by my father. He told me all that I feared, he told me that I no longer belonged where I was. I wasn\u2019t an angel anymore. I was no longer his light bringer. His Lucifer. I was a mutation of his will. And so he extracted me from grace. And I fell.\u201d\n\nA long silence stretched between us, only interrupted when the bartender poured us two new drinks. Lucy drank hers reflectively. I didn\u2019t touch mine.\n\n\u201cI am afraid,\u201d Lucy said quietly, \u201cthat this is the part that generally makes people want to punch me in the face.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked. \u201cBecause your dad threw you out?\u201d I paused, trying to abide to her metaphor. \u201cThat he put you in Hell?\u201d\n\nLucy laughed sadly. \u201cAh, humans. My father gave you his way of thinking and look at you.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNo, not because he put me in Hell.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why?\u201d \n\n\u201cI fell to Earth,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cFather gave me dominion of the one place he thought I would fit in. Humans had free will, so did I. What is the saying? A match made in Heaven?\u201d She snorted dismally. \u201cOf course, that\u2019s not quite right, is it? When I fell, I was faced with a humanity that was so different from my father\u2019s little prototypes.\u201d\n\nHer tone had changed. There was an aggression behind her words that began to unsettle me all over again.\n\n\u201cI saw emperors and kings, governments and churches. I saw corporations who claimed to be rulers, presidents and big fat dictators. And I watched. I watched as humanity fought and lost, and finally, just finally, they gave up altogether. They were no longer able to rise up to all the greed and control set upon them. There was just too much to change and humans soon realised they just weren\u2019t as free as they thought they were. Sure, they live under the illusion that they have free lives, but most of them simply do not.\u201d She clicked her tongue. \u201cI grew to loathe you all.\u201d\n\nThen, she took another hit of her drink.\n\n\u201cI can see what you mean,\u201d I said, allowing my gaze \u2013 for the first time since meeting her \u2013 to graze over the other individuals in the bar. At the girls playing with their phones, the boys trying desperately to sober up, the men enraptured with their game of football on the telly. We all led very different lives, and we were all here to get drunk, to lose ourselves in entertainment. It hadn\u2019t been the first time that I\u2019d wondered what we were hiding from by doing this. And I knew then that I wasn\u2019t the only person to think it.\n\n\u201cYou hide behind your alcohol and poor choices and pretend you have free will,\u201d Lucy said, waving her hand across the room. No one paid us any attention. \u201cIt\u2019s true \u2013 my father gave you the will to make those decisions, but you squander it. The free will I fell to provide to all of you, the free will I was given by a twisted mistake, and you make a mockery of it. You follow senseless leaders without questioning them, you abide by laws made centuries ago that no longer make sense. You do these things because you have given up on the opportunity to follow the will of your own, not of others.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat isn\u2019t all of us, though, is it?\u201d I asked her, trying for some reason to defend our species from the mad young woman. \u201cBecause you see it on the news all the time, don\u2019t you? People do rise up, we do protest. People can make a difference.\u201d\n\nLucy laughed bitterly, nibbling the rim of her glass. \u201cReally?\u201d she said. \u201cYou can sit here and say that it can\u2019t be all bad because of the few that refuse to conform? Those you call your rebels? They make up for it all?\u201d She grinned around her glass. \u201cBy that logic, I am the biggest rebel of them all. Am I expected to make up for all your sorry mistakes?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy your logic,\u201d I said, \u201cyou should be punishing it, right? If that\u2019s what this metaphor is all about.\u201d I laughed, I couldn\u2019t help myself. I took a sip of my drink. \u201cIs this whole story just so you can tell me that you think we\u2019re all going to Hell? If so, I think I can see why people want to punch you.\u201d\n\nLucy didn\u2019t say a word. Simply, she watched me. It felt unnerving to have someone like her watching me like that, with an intelligence that went beyond anything I\u2019d come across at gone midnight in a seedy bar. The drunkenness in her eyes was no longer present, her face wasn\u2019t flushed like before and even her makeup couldn\u2019t represent the mess I\u2019d seen when she\u2019d first appeared on the stool by my side. It was like I was looking at someone else entirely.\n\nAnd I was afraid.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s review what you\u2019ve said,\u201d Lucy said slowly, articulately. She wasn\u2019t slurring. Had she been slurring before? \u201cYou think I\u2019m going to tell you that humanity is going to Hell because you refuse to use the gift I gave you.\u201d Her nails curled into the bar. \u201cMy father may have been the one to guide me, but I paid for his mistakes. I am the one responsible for your will in the eyes of your species, but that was never true. You are responsible for what you do here, not me.\u201d\n\nShe pursed her lips, tapping the bar as a bartender filled her drink again. \u201cTell me, do you remember my mentioning Hell at any point during my story, or was that just you?\u201d\n\nI opened my mouth to answer, but something faltered. My lips trembled and I slammed them shut.\n\nLucy smiled, taking a sip. \u201cThought not.\u201d She looked away, eyes scanning the room lazily. \u201cWhat I did say is something that is indeed mentioned in your scriptures. My father gave me dominion of Earth. A place filled with free will. Free will that goes to waste.\u201d Her lip twisted. \u201cHumans sin all the time. Not because of me, not because of evil or my dominion over this place. Fact is, I don\u2019t lift a finger. I don\u2019t, because I don\u2019t see the point. You make terrible decisions and follow mindless leaders, you do bad things and you make a mess of your Earth.\u201d Lucy\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cDo you know how much suffering is happening all over the planet right now? How many people are dying of illnesses that could have easily been cured, but aren\u2019t because of the selfishness of humanity? Do you know how many children are being abused, raped, forced into marriage? How many people have been forced to become soldiers in meaningless wars? How many humans have killed for ideals they don\u2019t believe in?\u201d\n\nI stayed very quiet. There was nothing I could say. Lucy\u2019s words were unbearably honest and every sentence sliced into me like a blade. I felt cold and sick and terrified.\n\n\u201cWar, famine, pestilence, death, these things are all present and they have nothing to do with me or to do with any deity. They are all here because of you. Not because of your free will, but your inability to use it.\u201d \n\nLucy smiled at me, a grin so cold and unnatural that I felt like I should run all over again. But I stayed where I was, frozen to my very core, because I wanted to hear what she had to say. Because I needed to.\n\n\u201cAnd here\u2019s the kicker,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cBecause this is the part that actually enrages people enough to kick me.\u201d She winked. \u201cHell isn\u2019t what happens after you die. Hell is right here, right now. Somewhere through the many scriptures, a few words got crossed over and people started thinking that Hell was a punishment after you die. Fact is, Hell is Earth. My Earth. God gave this place to me to do with it what I will and I\u2026 I refuse to do anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d I asked, because I was suddenly very desperate.\n\n\u201cExactly what you think,\u201d Lucy said, toasting her glass. I didn\u2019t reciprocate, and she laughed. A light and airy sound. \u201cI had so many plans for your species, I wanted for us to rejoice in our free will together, to create a place that was free from the cruelty and power my father exuded over the angels \u2013 his first borns. I wanted to make a real utopia. Unfortunately, you humans just don\u2019t want that.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cMy father sent me down here thinking I had become one of you. All that I have learned is that he gave you much more of his image than he ever intended.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d I said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course it isn\u2019t funny,\u201d Lucy said, grinning even wider to prove her sick irony. \u201cHumans punish themselves by sitting by and doing nothing. They have made their own Hell and, you know what\u2019s worse \u2013 what\u2019s ultimately worse? \u2013 some of you are so blind to it that you think your life is Heavenly.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t wait for me to ask what she meant, she simply barrelled forward: \u201cThe rich and powerful, those in positions that steal from everyone else? They get a taste of the good life, that\u2019s very true. Then they die and they don\u2019t go to Hell. They come back here, to Earth. Which is Hell.\u201d She tipped her head. \u201cAre you following?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cReincarnation,\u201d Lucy said quickly, she practically purred the words. \u201cA neat little trick to make sure your souls stay here forever. You get a taste of the good life every once in a while, a handful of you at a time, and that\u2019s enough for you to believe that this is some kind of real middle-ground. That you aren\u2019t living Hell every day. Then, you die. You die for a moment and then you\u2019re in the body of someone facing the realities of Hell. But of course, you never remember the time you spent in a better life. A part of you just has that inkling to hope. That\u2019s all. Hope makes you think that it can all get better.\u201d\n\nShe slammed her drink so hard against the counter that it shattered. I didn\u2019t do anything, not even when flecks of glass littered my hands. I could only stare at her, a tightness in my chest constricting my very soul. No one else in this bar mattered in this moment, but of course that was what she had been saying this whole time, hadn\u2019t she? None of them noticed the scene, they were caught up in their own realities \u2013 their own Hells. \n\nThe bartender didn\u2019t clean the mess. The glass lay there, remnants of Lucy\u2019s words lying in a stolid mass on the streaked wooden surface. \n\n\u201cIt never gets better,\u201d Lucy spat. \u201cYou are stuck in a loop and, until you do something about it, you will never be free. None of you. And I won\u2019t do a thing to stop it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d I asked. I don\u2019t know when I started seeing the girl in front of me as more than a girl. But with a weakness threatening to pull me apart, I stared at the bright haired thing in front of me and I saw something more than a human in her early twenties. I saw more than a girl suffering abuse from her father.\n\nI saw a fallen angel. I saw a being with scars buried so deep that they existed beyond this realm of seeing entirely. I saw something that I would never be able to write down in words, no matter how long I lived. \n\n\u201cHow do we change this?\u201d I begged.\n\nBut Lucy didn\u2019t answer me. I didn\u2019t blame her for that. Blame gets thrown around so often and I knew then that she was sick of that. Sick of being blamed for our mistakes.\n\nSo I changed tactics. \u201cWhy me?\u201d\n\nIt was an honest question and I think somewhere deep down, Lucifer respected that honesty. \n\nWhich is why she said, \u201cWhen you first saw me, you were afraid for my safety. When I told you I was the devil, you wanted to lock me away, but still, you did so because you were afraid for me and not for yourself. You didn\u2019t wish to harm me, not even when I told you who I was and what I could be capable of for changing your sorry lives. You are a good person, but I am afraid that means nothing when you don\u2019t have the will to do anything with it.\u201d\n\nShe smiled at me sympathetically. The devil, showing sympathy for the human that sat across from her at the bar. It was surreal and, for a few heavy moments, I truly thought I must be dead. There was no other way to explain what I was seeing, who I was speaking with. What I had just heard.\n\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to do?\u201d\n\nLucy reached out to me. She placed a hand on my shoulder. Her hand was cold and warm at the same time, and I felt my blood boil where her fingers scraped my skin. \n\nAnd I knew.\n\nSharing a story like this isn\u2019t easy. Hell, it might be the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. Good thing there\u2019s no such thing as Hell, then, right?\n\nThe fact of the matter is simple. The world is a mess because we refuse to change anything. The devil herself walks among us and she desperately wants to make our lives better, but she won\u2019t. She won\u2019t, because we won\u2019t. We have to prove our will to her before she is willing to do anything herself. We have to be good to each other, to help us all to be free.\n\nOf course, Lucifer told me one last thing before she left that bar. One thing that will stick with me until this body is nothing but rot in the dirt.\n\n\u201cYou can tell as many people as you want, but take a good look at me. I have told five other humans this night the same things I have told you, and this was their reaction. They have hurt me, burned me, thrown their food and drink at me. Humans are afraid of their free will and they find it so much easier to hurt than to own up for their own inadequacies. You will only be free when you stop seeing yourself in the same way my father sees himself.\u201d\n\nSo that\u2019s what I\u2019ll leave you with. Lucifer won her wager that night and I let her walk out the door.\n\nAnd I beg you to do the same. If the devil approaches you one night, listen to what she has to say, and listen to what I have been able to tell you of our meeting.\n\nThe devil is real and she doesn\u2019t want to torture us.\n\nNo, we do that just fine on our own.\n"},"213":{"title":"If you can see this, it is very important that you keep reading","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/9qzt9j\/if_you_can_see_this_it_is_very_important_that_you\/","flair":"Beyond Belief","author":"writechriswrite","selftext":"This is Col. Jacob Wayne of the United States Air Force. If you\u2019re reading this right now, it is very important that you keep reading until the end. It should take three to five minutes, and it is extremely important that you read carefully and follow the instructions provided.\n\nHumor me if you must, but please don\u2019t look away until you've finished reading. Oh, and please try to stay calm. Any increase in your stress levels will draw Their attention.\n\nErgo, I won\u2019t go into detail as to how you got where you are. How you got here isn\u2019t as important as getting you out. Believe me when I say we are working on that right now. The best way to help yourself is to keep reading. Don\u2019t scan ahead. Don\u2019t read out loud. Just read.\n\nRight now, you\u2019re probably thinking back on the past few days and nothing felt out of the ordinary. You went about your regular daily activities with nothing unusual to report. That\u2019s because They are very good, so good most people don\u2019t even realize they\u2019re in the simulation. \n\nEven as our code works its way deeper into Their program, They are monitoring you. So please, remain calm.\n\nIt was tricky, but we found a way in to communicate directly with you. We had to embed this message into your daily routine so it didn\u2019t draw Their attention.  You\u2019re probably reading this on Reddit, Facebook, or some other social media site. Might even be in an email forward or a book, we don't know. We can\u2019t control how the message gets to you; we only know that you are receiving it. \n\nSubliminally, as your eyes are passing over these words, a code is being uploaded into your brain. Think of it as a computer virus, or in this case, an antivirus. Your brain is an organic computer, and They exploited that. They hacked right into your subconscious mind and overwrote it with Their simulation code. That\u2019s how They got in, and that\u2019s why everything appears normal. You might think that you\u2019re going about your daily life, but in reality you\u2019re strapped to a table with tubes sticking out of your body.\n\nNow that the code is uploading, you may begin to feel some sensations. For example, one ear might feel slightly warmer than the other. You might even feel an itch or tickle. Don\u2019t scratch, just let it be. Ignore the dull background hum you might hear as well. That\u2019s Their program. If They catch on before our code has time to work They will abort the simulation. If that happens, you will be lost to us forever.\n\nOh, and don\u2019t be alarmed, but by now They realize we are in Their system. You may notice some small changes, specifically a slight shortness of breath or that you have to control your breathing manually. This is normal. \n\nWe know from other communication attempts that whenever They discover a code break in, the first system They power down is the one controlling your breathing. Thankfully, even in the simulation you are capable of breathing manually. Try it. Breathe in. Breathe out. Inhale. Exhale. \n\nAwesome.\n\nYou\u2019re doing just fine.\n\nThey\u2019ve probably figured out there\u2019s a glitch, but if our code is working we\u2019ve disabled Their ability to do a hard reboot. Because of this, They will try other methods to disrupt the upload. It is very important that you ignore anything that might draw your attention from these words. If They pull you away before the upload completes it will delete our code. Block them out. Ignore the movements you see in your peripheral vision. Those sounds you hear, the voices, they aren\u2019t family, friends, or coworkers in need of attention. They may even try to use your pets. They know your weaknesses.\n\nOverlook the notifications popping up on your screen if you're on a phone or computer. Block them all out until you finish reading. It\u2019s just another way They\u2019ll try to break our communication link.\n\nEvidently, if our code is working, the next thing you\u2019ll notice is an overwhelming urge to swallow. You don\u2019t realize it, but there\u2019s a feeding tube down your throat. You'll only know it's there because your tongue won\u2019t rest comfortably in your mouth. You might also become hyper aware of the amount of saliva being produced. Don\u2019t overreact. If you have to swallow, just swallow. It\u2019s only weird if you make it weird.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re still reading this, the code upload is about 90% complete. We\u2019ve locked onto your location. You\u2019re doing great, but you\u2019re really going to need to focus now. Once the upload is complete there will be instructions you will need to follow to exit the simulation. That is, if you\u2019ve followed the instructions and haven\u2019t looked away.\n\nComplicating matters is the fact that They now know we\u2019re here, and They know what we\u2019re doing. Their attempts to divert your attention through the simulation proved unsuccessful, so now They\u2019re going to use your body\u2019s systems against you. THEY ARE IN YOUR BRAIN. They want you to blink. Don\u2019t blink. Your life depends on keeping your eyes open. \n\nAlmost there, just a few paragraphs more until the code upload is complete. Don\u2019t scan down, or up, just keep reading. I got you this far. Stay with me. Eyes open, eyes front, keep them locked on the screen. \n\nPLEASE FOCUS! I don\u2019t want to lose you. I\u2019ve lost so many already. Ignore it all! Block everything out. Ignore that tickle on your scalp and the itch on your arm. That\u2019s them, attempting a manual override. Don\u2019t give up now, you\u2019ve made it this far. FIGHT IT. You\u2019re almost there. Just follow the instructions below and we can get you out.\n\nEmbedded in this text are the steps you need to follow to unplug from the simulation. If we did this correctly, the first letter of each paragraph will tell you what you need to do. DON'T LOOK YET. The upload still needs to finish. I hope you didn't look. \n\nUpload complete.

Kids are supposed to sit with their grandparents and video tape, voice record, or transcribe their oldest memories for posterity (and for an easy way to bring up their GPA).\n\nI have been doing this for seventeen years, and when I collected the projects this time around, I assumed they would be as dull, if not duller than usual. This had not been a particularly bright class.\n\nSo I went home, poured myself a glass of wine, and prepared for a long night of \u201cI only owned two pairs of pants when I was your age\u201d and \u201cMy brother got beat with a newspaper for hitting a baseball into a neighbor\u2019s yard.\u201d And of course, these projects were peppered with innocent, old-person comments that were so horribly sexist and racist you just had to laugh. \n\nNow, I had a girl in my class whom I will call Olivia. She was pudgy, quiet, and proved herself a consistent B student. I expected her project to be as unremarkable as her, and perhaps that\u2019s why I was so profoundly disturbed by what I witnessed that night.\n\nOlivia had submitted two discs for some reason, so I began with the one marked \u201cinterview.\u201d My screen hiccupped twice before a grainy image of a living room came into view. The place was a hoarder\u2019s hell. Olivia was curled up in an armchair clutching a notebook and looking like a scared animal. Across from her sat a man with a somber countenance, smoking a cigarette and staring at her expectantly.\n\n\u201cGo ahead,\u201d a woman\u2019s voice whispered from behind the camera. Olivia\u2019s owlish eyes flashed towards the screen, then back to the man.\n\n\u201cI am here with my Great Uncle Stephen,\u201d she began almost inaudibly. \u201cHe is going to tell us about his oldest memories from being in the army.\u201d\n\nGreat Uncle Stephen looked like he\u2019d rather be in a goddamn trench at the moment, but he waited patiently for the questions to begin.\n\nNot surprisingly, Olivia read verbatim from the suggested questions sheet I had handed out to the students. He answered her curtly. Once or twice I heard her mother whisper \u201cspeak up, Olivia\u201d from behind the camera. Typical, boring shit.\n\nSo I was intrigued when Olivia set down the notebook and asked, \u201cDid you like being in the army?\u201d \n\nThat was totally off-script. Great Uncle Stephen emitted a chain smoker\u2019s wheeze. \u201cNope. Glad to get out of my town though.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d\n\n\u201cBalkans.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-huh,\u201d she said. I doubted she knew what the Balkans were, and my suspicion was confirmed when she asked, \u201cWas Baukiss very different from here?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nMom cleared her throat from behind the camera, perhaps encouraging Great Uncle Stephen to be a little more forthcoming.\n\nBut Olivia seemed genuinely interested. \u201cUncle Stephen,\u201d she asked, \u201cwhat is your very worst memory from the army?\u201d\n\nThe old man crushed his cigarette in the ashtray and then slowly lifted himself out of his chair. \u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d he mumbled. The camera cut off.\n\nWhen the screen flashed back on, everything was the same except Great Uncle Stephen had several pieces of paper in plastic sleeves laid atop all the crap sitting on his coffee table. One, he held in his hand.\n\n\u201cI was a kid when I enlisted,\u201d he said, looking at Olivia. \u201cYour brother\u2019s age,\u201d he told her. Olivia nodded. \u201cI never saw combat. Both of my deployments were to cities in Eastern Europe that had been destroyed by civil wars. Everything was a mess. I felt like a janitor for fuck\u2019s sa-\u201d \n\n\u201cAhem!\u201d Mom coughed.\n\nGreat Uncle Stephen sighed and looked at his paper. \u201cMy unit was assigned to a school that had been obliterated by all the violence. Broken windows, caved in rooms \u2013 and for some reason, the part that got to me the most was that the school had been like this for years before we got there. No one had lifted a finger to fix it. I saw kids walk by it on their way to go beg for money or whatever shit they did-\u201d\n\nThe camera dipped towards the floor as I heard Mom whisper harshly at Great Uncle Stephen. I couldn\u2019t make out what she was saying, but it wasn\u2019t hard to imagine.\n\n\u201cDo you want to hear this goddamn story or not?\u201d I heard him bark in response. \u201cThen you better let me tell it how I want.\u201d\n\n\u201cMom,\u201d Olivia chimed. \u201cPlease stop interrupting.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you presenting this in front of the class?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Mom, we\u2019re just handing it in to the teacher.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s heard the word shit before,\u201d Great Uncle Stephen contributed helpfully. I wasn\u2019t a \u201che\u201d as a matter of fact, but other than that the statement was accurate.\n\nThe camera was lifted and after a couple of blurry focus adjustments, the shot was the same as before.\n\n\u201cAhh I\u2019m talking too much anyway,\u201d he grumbled. He lifted the piece of paper in his hand close to his face. \u201cIn the basement, I found this letter. I didn\u2019t know what it said but I had a buddy of mine translate it. So I\u2019m gonna read it now. And then I\u2019ll tell you what I saw in that basement.\u201d\n\nA chill ran down my spine. Mom zoomed in to Great Uncle Stephen and his letter. His palsied hands trembled as he held up the paper. This is what he read:\n\n\n\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI never loved my country. So many of these skirmishes are born from patriotism, a power struggle for the shards of a once-great empire, but I do not care what name my home has on a map. This fighting is senseless and I stay as far away from it as I can.\n\nIt was not these attacks and disorganized violence that took the lives of my wife and child. It was illness. Mercifully, it happened quickly for the baby. Nadja suffered for longer. I watched in horror knowing I could do nothing for them. My only solace is that I was there for them every step of the way. I stopped going to work one day, and no one came after me. I doubt they noticed I was gone. Since the school was simply across a field, visible from my window, it would have been easy to go for a few hours each day and come home quickly to care for them. But what was the point? All I did was clean floors. I was as useless to the world as I was to my family.\n\nI tried to take Nadja to the hospital, but the journey was too long and taxing. I brought her home and she died that night.\n\nAfter Nadja and the baby were gone\u2026 well, I don\u2019t remember much. I didn\u2019t leave my hovel, barely ate and slept, thought many times of taking my own life. Tempting though it was, I felt paralyzed by my own helplessness.\n\nThe one thing that kept me sane was my radio. I never turned it off once. Even though I didn\u2019t listen to the words being said \u2013 in fact, the channel I got the clearest was in English (I think) which I don\u2019t speak a lick of. But the voices, the music, and the true knowledge that life existed beyond this violent city sustained me.\n\nI have no idea how long passed before I saw the light of day again. I was dizzy from hunger, so finding food was my priority. My radio came with me, of course. Since I first holed myself up, it has gone everywhere with me. It talks to me as I sleep and as I wake. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s saying, but I know I would die without it.\n\nOnce I had some water and food, it occurred to me that the only thing left to do was go back to work. So I did. The following morning, I simply returned to the school where I was a janitor and got back to work. \n\nNobody made a big deal out of it. Like I said, Nadja had been sick for a long time, and those who worked at the school knew it. I appreciate that no one had pestered me to come back to work during the hardest days of my life. The teachers never said much to me, but we smiled at each other in the halls and that mutual respect was perhaps the reason I decided to come back at all.\n\nThe place had gone to the dogs without me, so I simply grabbed my broom and rags from my closet and set to cleaning. Everyone is grateful to have me back, I know. And the best part is that nobody minds my radio. I bring it with me everywhere and keep the volume low enough not to disrupt the students. No one has ever complained. In fact, I suspect they like it.\n\nThe schoolhouse is not very big, but does require a lot of maintenance. The floors are always sticky and stained, so I spend most of my time mopping. Kids make messes \u2013 I guess that\u2019s why I\u2019m still in business. Sometimes I have to move things around to make sure I get every spot on the floor beautiful and clean, but I take pride in that.\n\nAnd the repairs! The school always needs tune-ups here and there, and I am happy to help. Some days I\u2019m reconstructing a desk that broke as I whistle along with the radio, other times I handle more serious, structural issues. Days when I have work like this, I feel truly instrumental, like a cog in a larger machine. How could this school survive without me? It took me a long time, but I once again feel that I have purpose.\n\nThere is a larder behind the school that is full of preserved food. In lieu of payment, I am allowed to take as much food as I need. That arrangement is fine \u2013 what would I do with money anyway? I used to bring the food back to my home, just one field away from the school, but when I started sleeping in the basement no one seemed to notice. This school is special to me and I cannot leave it unguarded.\n\nWhen I am besieged with memories of my wife and baby, I turn up the volume on the radio to drown out such thoughts. It works for me every time.\n\nExcept this morning.\n\nBecause this morning, I woke up to dead silence.\n\nI frantically examined the radio to see what had happened. I honestly cannot tell you how many days in a row I have been using it. Did it simply live out its life and die naturally? I have spent the entire day trying to fix it. Most of this time, I have been crying. I am losing my mind without it.\n\nI have given myself until sundown. If I cannot fix it by then, I am going to take my life. I am writing this because the sunlight is starting to die and I know what my fate shall be.\n\nI have thought about taking one last walk through the halls of my school, saying goodbye to the students and teachers. I know I will be missed. But I cannot bring myself to leave this room. I cannot go anywhere knowing that my radio is dead in here.\n\nThere are no more tears in me. It feels now like I can\u2019t catch my breath. I vomited what little food I had in my stomach and I am growing dizzy again, like I did after Nadja died. I am not long for this world.\n\nBut before I take my life, I have closed the door to this room and stuck a chair beneath the handle. It is the only room in the basement and has a small casement that lets in just enough light for me to see what I am doing. If anyone is kind enough to come looking for me, they should not be met with this gruesome sight. Perhaps they will see the door is blocked, smell my rotting body, and simply forget I ever existed.\n\nBut I have placed both my radio and this note outside the door. Kind sir, if you are reading this, I have one humble request: please fix it. Save my radio. It did not deserve to die in its sleep and I am ashamed that I cannot revive it.\n\nNow I am ready to join Nadja and little Ludmilla in heaven. I hope this school can find another janitor who loves and cares for it the way I do.\n\nThe hour is now. Do not forget my radio.\n\nStanislav\n\n\n\n\nWhen Mom zoomed back out, Olivia had tears in her eyes. \u201cThank you for sharing, Uncle Stephen,\u201d Mom said, her voice choked. \u201cI think we have enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d Olivia chirped. \u201cHe said there\u2019s more. What did you find?\u201d\n\nBefore Great Uncle Stephen could open his mouth, the image disappeared. My jaw dropped. Was that it? What did Great Uncle Stephen see?\n\nI promptly remembered that there was a second disc. This one was unmarked, but I hoped it contained the rest of the interview.\n\nThere was no video, only audio. The voice that started up was Olivia\u2019s.\n\n\u201cHi Miss Gerrity. I\u2019m sorry about my mom, but she refused to record the rest of what my uncle was saying. But I asked him to continue and secretly recorded the story as a voice memo on my phone. I remember you said earlier this year that history is written by the people who win wars.\u201d She sucked in a breath and commenced crying. \u201cBut everyone\u2019s history is important, even if they are sad, pathetic people and even if they never won a single thing in their life. I haven\u2019t slept through the night since I finished this project, but you have to hear what my uncle has to say.\u201d\n\nThere were tears in my eyes, too. The sincerity of her words was beautiful. I was also flattered that she had remembered some trite phrase I threw around because it was what my history teachers said to me. \n\nBefore I got too sappy over it, the audio began again.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d came Mom\u2019s frustrated voice. \u201cIf you want to hear the rest of the story, fine, but this is not appropriate for a school project.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me finish,\u201d Great Uncle Stephen snapped. \u201cIf it\u2019s too much for you, help yourself to a snack in the kitchen. But Olivia wants to know what happened.\u201d\n\nI heard her mother mumble something and walk away. Olivia and her uncle were alone. I imagined her looking at him expectantly. \n\n\u201cSo did you find the radio? Or did it get ruined when the school got blown up?\u201d\n\nHe rasped and I heard the distinct click of a lighter. \u201cThat letter,\u201d he began slowly, \u201chad a date on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat date?\u201d she inquired hungrily.\n\n\u201cIt was dated two weeks before we started rebuilding the school.\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you say the school had been destroyed like two years ago?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied Great Uncle Stephen. \u201cIt had been.\u201d\n\nThere was silence as I felt goosebumps on my arms. The images that came to my mind were almost too overwhelming to express, but Great Uncle Stephen put them into words effortlessly. Clearly he had spent his whole life thinking about it.\n\n\u201cThis man, this Stanislav, went to a vandalized, falling apart schoolhouse and cleaned up blood and rubble like it was spilled drinks and dust. He smiled at dead bodies in the hallway and believed they were smiling back at him because they liked his radio. He moved around corpses so he could sweep the ground under them. The roof was half collapsed, so when it rained, he must\u2019ve gotten soaking wet but was so oblivious that he didn\u2019t even feel a thing.\u201d I could hear Olivia crying steadily. \u201cI found the larder he was talking about. It was all pickled, preserved food that probably tasted like shit. Most of the stuff was moldy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid \u2013 did you see the dead body?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Hanging from the ceiling, but still amazingly\u2026 lifelike. He wasn\u2019t rotting away.  This hadn\u2019t happened years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he look peaceful?\u201d she asked, a chord of desperation in her voice.\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t tell you. The smell was rank, and his face was blue and his eyes were bulging. Like this.\u201d I imagined him demonstrating. \n\n\u201cAnd the radio?\u201d Olivia wept.\n\nI heard Great Uncle Stephen take a long drag of his cigarette. \u201cIt was there, alright. And it was still on.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"215":{"title":"My son's camera monitor alerted in the middle of the night. I checked it and saw my wife and son sitting on the bed. They weren't my wife and son.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/bsrmy5\/my_sons_camera_monitor_alerted_in_the_middle_of\/","flair":"Series","author":"RisingMac","selftext":"I'm a nurse and I currently work nights. It's a total drag but I'm hopeful I can go to days soon since some coworkers are planning retirements. Anyway, I was working one night when just after 3am my son's monitor alerted me to sound and movement. No big deal at all, he probably coughed loudly or sneezed or something. He's three now so he generally sleeps all night. I bring it up on my phone and I see him and my wife sitting on the bed. Again, no big deal. He might have cried out or gotten scared or something.\n\nI was about to close the app when I noticed they were acting strange, almost creepy. And when I say \"almost\" creepy, I mean creepy as balls. They were sitting on the bed together both of them just staring up at the camera with blank, emotionless stares. The night vision is black and white, so they had white, eerie looking eyes. They didn't move at all aside from their visible breathing, they just sat there staring at the camera.\n\nI close the app and give my wife a call to make sure everything is ok. I never get to call home on lunch so in a way this is kind of nice to get to talk to my family while at work.\n\nIt rings a couple times before she answers with a very groggy \"hello?\" It was like she was dead asleep when I called and she looked wide awake when on the camera.\n\n\"Hey. You guys ok?\"\n\n\"Huh? Yeah. Buddy (my son's nickname) came in like 15 minutes ago. Seemed scared so I said he could sleep with mama.\"\n\nI'm confused here since I saw them in his room a minute ago. Literally 60 seconds had passed since I closed the app and made the call.\n\n\"Wait, so you guys are in bed?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I fell back asleep right away. Everything ok? Everybody keeps waking me up.\" She's kind of annoyed.\n\n\"Hang on a sec.\" I put her on speaker and bring up the app, hoping I don't see it. When the app loads I get that pang of intense nervousness in my stomach that I haven't had in a long time, since I was a kid in school and realized while I was eating breakfast a paper or something was due that day and I hadn't done it. My heart leaps into my throat. My wife and son are sitting on his bed looking up at the camera, same emotionless stares.\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\n\"You guys are in bed right?\"\n\n\"Yeah, we're trying to sleep.\"\n\n\"Well I'm looking at his camera and I see you two sitting on his bed.\"\n\n\"Huh? No. We're in our bed.\"\n\n\"I know that's what you mean, but I'm looking at his bed and you two are in there.\"\n\n\"Hang on,\" she says. She's quiet for a sec while she brings up the camera on her phone. I hear this guttural, terrified gasp. Like she had sucked all the air in the room into her lungs filling them to capacity. I don't hear this kind of gasp from my wife often, usually only when she's truly afraid like during a jump scare in a movie or one time when we turned her back on our son for literally a second and he was down by the mailbox inches from the road. I hear rustling of sheets and the line goes dead.\n\nOf course now I'm absolutely terrified myself so I immediately call back. It goes to voicemail so I call again. I call again and again with no answer. Finally after about four minutes she calls me. I tell you that four minutes felt like 40 years.\n\n\"Hey, what's happening?!\" I ask.\n\nShe's absolutely hysterical and crying, I can't understand a word she says.\n\n\"Stop! Slow down for just a second,\" I say.\n\nShe slows down enough to explain they are in the car and driving to her parents. She looked at the camera and when she saw what was on it she got up and grabbed our son and rushed downstairs and out the door. Didn't even close the garage.\n\n\"Don't worry about it,\" I said. \"I'll drive by when I get off and close it.\" We live in a generally safe neighborhood so I'm not too concerned the door is up.\n\n\"You will not go in there!\" she says.\n\n\"Hell no,\" I return.\n\n\"Why are we on the camera?\" she asked. \"Is it a recording?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" I return. \"I'm gonna keep watching it and see if there's anything I can tell. Do our code words with Buddy.\"\n\nWe have code words because we're nerds. We've seen too many pod people and impostor movies, so we decided a long time ago to make code words with each other to be able to tell if one of us was an impostor. We have a couple code words, but we also have a three sentence story we recite together, each saying a different part alternately of each other. I hear her on the phone saying the things we taught our son, he giggles as he says them (he does every time we practice) since he thinks they're a joke and doesn't have any idea of the real meaning. We're both convinced he's our son. My wife then says our part and I'm convinced she's her. We made up these words as a complete joke to ourselves. I never once in my life ever imagined we'd actually need them. Unreal.\n\nShe got to her parents safely and it was hard to hang up. I told her we'll figure it out in the morning, hopefully just a glitch. She said she didn't think it was a glitch. When she was running out she had to run by our son's room and the door was open. There's a little flashing light on the back of the camera that indicates its connected to the internet. It gives off just enough light that when she ran by she thought she saw, out of the corner of her eye, a shadowy outline of what could have been an adult sitting on our son's bed. It sends chills down my spine to think about.\n\nKnowing they were safe and out of the house is the only thing that kept me at work that night. It was a long four hours but I kept checking the camera every chance I got. Sure enough, they were still sitting on the bed staring up at the camera with emotionless gazes.\n\nI studied them to see if I could see any pattern, from their breathing to their blinking. Their breathing was steady and looked normal, it was their blinking that would tell me if this was just some kind of bizarre, time looped freak accident video or not. I intently stare at my phone and count the seconds between each blink, telling myself if this is a loop then their blinks should be even and occur at the same time each time.\n\nThere was no pattern to their blinking, it was erratic and random, just as a person blinking should be. The passing hours are what finally sealed the deal that this was not a weird looped video of some kind. My son's window is visible on camera and I can see on camera that it is getting lighter outside his room. His curtains keep out just enough light to prevent the camera from exiting night vision, but lets in just enough to be able to tell the sun is rising.\n\nI try to figure out what the hell I'm going to do before I leave work. Calling the police comes to mind, but I talk myself out of it. First of all what am I supposed to say? Someone is in my house that looks like my wife but isn't? Worse yet, what if they \\*are\\* entities of some kind and the police do go over and it kills them or something.\n\nI decide to tell coworker about it. He's a firm believer in the paranormal and might have a suggestion. I show him the video and tell him the story. His initial response of \"that's creepy as fuck\" doesn't help much, but he says he wants to go over and check it out. He says we both should to see if Not-My-Wife will try and act like my wife. I tell him absolutely not and he says we should at least go to the house even if we don't go in. I agree on that since I wanted to close the garage.\n\nWe got to my house and walked around the perimeter first. Not sure what we wanted to accomplish by that, but it felt like something we should do. The curtains were all drawn since nobody was there to open them in the morning, so we couldn't see anything. I went to close the garage and suddenly had this overwhelming urge to go inside and investigate, it was like I just had to know what was going on. So in we went.\n\nWe walked through the kitchen towards the foyer where the stairs are. It's so quiet in our house right now you could hear a feather drop, forget the pin. We stop at the bottom of the stairs and wait a few seconds. I look at the camera again and they are still sitting there. I've never been so scared in my life. My coworker puts his foot on the first step and I suddenly say \"stop\" loudly.\n\n\"Forget this, we're outta here,\" I tell him. \"Come on,\" I start making my way back to the kitchen.\n\nWe hear a loud creak in the floor from upstairs. It's my son's room. He has a very loud, creaky board right in the middle of his floor that's almost impossible not to step on. My wife and are still deciding if we ever want to fix it because it will alert us if he's ever up to no good when he gets older trying to sneak out or something.\n\n\"Come on, come on, COME ON!\" I yell as I motion for him to move his ass. We're out of the house in about two seconds. Out on the street I check my phone. Now only Not-My-Son was sitting on the bed, same blank stare. Not-My-Wife was gone.\n\n\"Holy shit!\" my coworker says,\n\n\"That was stupid as fuck of us. Do NOT tell my wife we went inside.\" She would be so ungodly mad if she found out what we just did.\n\nI use my garage door opener in my car to close the door. Before we leave I look at the camera again.

Over the years, I\u2019ve seen him cough out cinnamon, lay flat on the hood of his car as it slowly creeps down the driveway, and douse himself in lukewarm water, all the while screaming *epic win*, *epic fail*, or, fuck, *epic maintenance of the status quo*, for all I know. It can get tiring to watch him go about his shenanigans in the pursuit of viral fame. So, when he knocked on my door the other day, told me he was going away for a few weeks, and asked that I get his mail, honestly, it was a relief. I can\u2019t explain the peace of mind I had knowing I didn\u2019t have to brace myself for any of his stupidity for a while. I was always afraid his stunts would wind up bleeding over into my life.\n\nThings were pretty normal for the first couple of days. He received a few bills, a bit of spam, and what I could only assume was a birthday card. Then, one evening, I got home to find a cardboard box waiting on his front porch. In big red letters was written \u201cReturn to Sender\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m no small fry, but I admit I had trouble lifting the box on my own. It was really freaking heavy. Lugging it across the road to my house was even harder, and I quickly realized there was no way I was going to drag it up the stairs and through my front door. I decided I\u2019d leave his package in my garage. It wasn\u2019t like I kept my car in there: the garage door was a piece of shit that refused to open without a good thug and a whack. It was less trouble just leaving the car in the driveway than it was to fight with the garage door every morning and night. In hindsight, I should have set the package down while I struggled to open the tricky door, but you know how it is when you\u2019ve got a good grip on something, no point in setting it down if you don\u2019t have to.\n\nIt was as I kicked the door for a third time that I lost my grip on the package, and it fell to the ground. I heard a light crack inside.\n\n\u201cShit,\u201d I cursed.\n\nI hoped I hadn\u2019t broken anything important, but figured I just wouldn\u2019t tell my neighbor about it and let him assume the break happened en-route.\n\nHands free, I finally managed to get the garage door unstuck, and boy did it screech in protest as it rolled up and over me. I dragged the box the rest of the way, setting it in the corner for whenever my neighbor would come back to claim it. And then, I forgot all about it. Until a few days passed, that is.\n\nI\u2019m not sure exactly how long it took for the smell to waft in from the crack under the garage-to-house door, but it came in in slow progression. It was a sickly sweet odor similar to a skunk, and for the first few days after I smelled it, I genuinely assumed that\u2019s exactly what it was: roadkill that had left its mark on my house. It was only when I realized the scent was growing more intense instead of fading that I went looking for a source. That\u2019s when I opened the garage door, and that\u2019s when the odor knocked me back, holding my nose.\n\nThe culprit wasn\u2019t hard to identify. The only change in my garage was the box in the corner. I remember thinking it must have been one of those meat-of-the-month subscription boxes. The meat must have gone rancid from being left out of the fridge for so long. How much meat could have been in there for the box to have been so large and heavy? An entire freaking cow?\n\nI covered my nose as I approached the box, a pair of scissors in my hands. I probably wouldn\u2019t have needed them to open it, as it had become soggy enough at the bottom to poke through with a finger, but I wasn\u2019t about to poke my finger into spoiled meat juices. That soggy bottom was the reason I had to open the box in the first place. If I tried to drag it out whole, everything would spill onto the floor. I was going to have to dump the pieces of meat one garbage bag at a time, and take them down to the dumpster, a process I wasn\u2019t looking forward to.\n\nMy scissors tore through the tape along the top of the cardboard box. I thought the smell couldn\u2019t get any worse, but as I flipped the flaps open, I discovered a whole new gamut of stink. It was like opening a burning oven, but instead of a heat wave, I was met with waves of piss, sweat, shit, and putrefaction. It was so bad that I staggered back and had to force down the puke begging to guzzle out of me. I don\u2019t think I could have handled that scent mingling with the horrors coming out of the box. I\u2019m not ashamed to admit I ran out the door for a breath of fresh air, but in the short time I\u2019d spent in the garage, the smell had become so ingrained in the fabric of my clothes that it clung to me like a shadow.\n\nNothing I tried could keep the smell out of my nostrils. Not air fresheners, not a face mask, not three showers and a change of clothes. Every second that box lay open in my garage was another second the smell was allowed a foothold into my home. I had to bite the bullet.\n\nI returned to the garage, the flaps of the box still open as though inviting me to look. I was prepared, a clothespin pinning my nostrils shut, a garbage bag in one hand, the strongest cleaner I could find in the other, and long rubber gloves to keep my skin from having to touch what was inside. But, as it turns out, I needed none of those things.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t have to touch or clean the contents of that box, I would only have to suffer the nightmares every night. You see, there was meat in that box, but it didn\u2019t come from a cow or a pig. No, it was worse than that. It was my neighbor. Dead. Still in one piece, but dead.\n\nI called the cops, and naturally, they took me in for interrogation. It\u2019s kind of hard *not* to suspect the man with a corpse in his garage, after all. Thankfully, they soon realized I wasn\u2019t involved. My DNA might have been all over that box, the smell might have left a mark throughout my house, but there was one piece of irrefutable evidence in my neighbor\u2019s own hands that proved my innocence: a vlogging camera.\n\nThey showed me the footage only once. I\u2019m not sure if they were allowed to, or if they felt so bad for me they figured it couldn\u2019t hurt. Either way, I saw it.\n\nMy neighbor was sitting in the box outside of a shipping facility, laughing as he told the world how he was going to mail himself across state lines. He\u2019d brought pee bottles, food, a pillow, and a few flashlights. His friend \u2013 a guy I\u2019d seen at his place several times to help with his stunts \u2013, closed the lid and presumably dropped him off for shipment. Throughout the next couple of hours\u2026or days, I\u2019m honestly not sure, my neighbor recorded a few short clips about his progress. \u2018I think I\u2019m in a truck now, I can feel it moving\u2019, \u2018Must be in a warehouse. Pretty warm here. Still got plenty of food!\u2019, that kind of stuff. And then, on the last entry, the box toppled over. He broke his neck, and that was it. The camera recorded until either the memory card got too full, or the battery died.\n\nThere\u2019s one thing I didn\u2019t tell the police after they showed me the video. One thing I heard in the footage that will haunt me to the day I die. Just after the tumble that broke his neck, I heard the familiar screeching sound of *my* garage door.\n\n***\n[ML](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/lyset.manen)"},"217":{"title":"How do I get my girlfriend to knock off this annoying habit?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/bfg42c\/how_do_i_get_my_girlfriend_to_knock_off_this\/","flair":null,"author":"queen_of_the_moths","selftext":"So I've been dating my girlfriend for almost a year, and last month, we moved in together. Maybe that's kind of fast. I don't know. My parents sure thought it was. But honestly, everything was great in the beginning. We get along really well, and we've never had more than a brief argument. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut then she started whistling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's so dumb, I know, but she's always whistling this weird song, and it really gets on my nerves. My mom kept telling me that once you move in with someone, you discover all of the quirks they'd been hiding from you, and it's not like I didn't expect that to be true. But for some reason, this is just an ongoing issue with us, and I don't know what to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt first I would just hear her whistling it when she was showering. It was kind of cute, like her own little bathroom theme song. I didn't recognize the melody, but it was very distinct. I could mimic it from memory if I wanted to. In fact, sometimes it gets stuck in my head, and it drives me a little crazy. You know the type.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter a week or so, I asked her what the song was, and she just laughed. I'm wondering if maybe she came up with it on her own, something that she does absently, especially once she started doing it more. Like I'd be reading a book, and she'd be on the computer, and she'd just start whistling. And I tried to ignore it. I seriously feel like a dick for being so grumpy about it, and I know she wasn't doing it to annoy me. But she'd just go on and on, and it would pull my attention away from whatever I was doing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I finally said something a few nights ago. I was going over some legal documents for work, and she just starts whistling like crazy, on and on. And I'm trying to just block it out, but it's seriously excessive. Like, I know you guys are probably thinking that I was overreacting, but it felt like she was whistling right into my ear, and it just frayed my last bit of patience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs calmly and nicely as I could, I called out to her and asked her to quiet down. She didn't reply. I asked her again, and she still didn't answer, so I left the bedroom and found her in the living room, watching a movie. She wasn't whistling anymore, and for some reason, that really irked me. It felt like she was messing with me. And she just looked over at me, like she didn't know what my deal was.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI asked her if she could stop whistling so much, and she told me she wasn't whistling. Now, I get that maybe she doesn't realize she's doing it, but no one whistles *that* much and doesn't notice. It's not really like her to mess with me like that, and I don't know what she's trying to get out of this. I thought maybe she was teasing or playing a joke, but she had to see how annoyed I was. I asked her again to just not whistle so loudly, and she didn't answer. There was tension in the room, and it felt like our first fight since moving in together. Even though she didn't whistle for the rest of the night, I couldn't focus on my work anyway because I was upset about the confrontation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen, of course, the next night she was whistling again. I hear her when she comes home from work, and she keeps going for at least an hour. I didn't want to have another fight, so I just hung out in the bedroom and listened to her move around for a while. I felt like I was blowing things out of proportion, but honestly, how hard is it to just not whistle all the time? It was no big deal when it was now and then, but I feel like she whistles more than she even talks to me now. So I'm sitting up in the room, thinking about that, and that's probably why I was worked up when I finally came down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe was cooking dinner, which is sweet, but she was still whistling. So I said, softly, \"Hey honey, maybe we should put on some music instead, so you don't have to fill the silence with whistling.\" I tried to play it off like a joke, but I knew she'd probably see through it and get annoyed again. She didn't even turn to face me, just huffed and kept cooking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter a minute, I told her I was sorry about the other night, but the whistling just sort of strikes my ear wrong, and if she could try not to whistle so much and so loudly, it would make my life a lot easier. I feel like I was being fair. I know it seems controlling and nit picky, but it was bothering me a lot. We all have our things, you know? I try not to chew loudly at the table because it bothers her, so why can't she just stop whistling sometimes for me?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut she totally freaked out. She turned around and told me she wasn't whistling and she didn't know what my problem was. At this point, I don't get why she was doing this. It obviously wasn't funny for either of us, and she seemed genuinely upset, so I don't know why she kept provoking me. I asked her what her deal was, why she was so defensive about the stupid whistling, and she told me to shut up. She told me she was sick of talking about it, like *I* was the one being unreasonable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI never get mad at her, but I just snapped. I told her to stop whistling before I lost my mind. She called me crazy, just because I was getting a little upset, and somehow, that was all I could take. I grabbed one of the cast iron pans from the stove and swung it at her head as hard as I could.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe fell over and smashed her head on the counter, but I swung the pan again before she hit the ground. I think I hit her maybe three or four times. I don't remember, but I feel horrible. There was blood everywhere, and her jaw might be broken. No, I think it is for sure. I couldn't believe I'd lost my temper like that, and I have no idea how we can move past this. I feel so ashamed for letting things get physical, regardless of how much she might have been provoking me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut here's the kicker. She's STILL FUCKING WHISTLING. And I asked her nicely to please stop, but now she won't even pause! For two days she's just been lying on the kitchen floor with her eyes rolled back and her mouth hanging open, just marinating in congealed blood, and she's STILL FUCKING WHISTLING. I don't know what to do. I don't want to break up, but this is just too much. I just need her to shut up. Just shut up. Just shut up. Just shut up.

I saw a *zombie*!\"\n\nI was in the kitchen making tea when my little girl came rushing in. She ran through the back door so fast she almost tripped up the step. I poured boiling water from the kettle into a mug, hardly looking up.\n\n\"Oh yeah?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I did! Its face was all pale and messed up! It was *gross*, dad!\"\n\nI put the kettle back and picked up the milk. Sighed inwardly. I *really* had to be more careful about what I watched on TV in the evening. Rosie has a habit of sneaking downstairs in the night, and last week she caught me watching *The Walking Dead*, of all things.\u00a0She's had zombies on the brain ever since. I keep telling her they're not real, but it doesn't seem to make a difference.\n\n\"Sweetheart, what did we say about zombies?\" I scooped the teabag out of the mug and dumped it in the bin. \"You know if you keep talking about them, daddy's going to get in trouble with mummy again.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but I *saw* one.\"\n\n\"I know, darling, but I already checked the back garden twice yesterday, and I can promise you it's a zombie-free zone.\"\n\n\"No, not in the back garden.\"\n\n\"Hm?\"\n\n\"I didn't see it in the back garden.\"\n\nI had the mug half raised to my lips, but now I put it down again. I turned to look at Rosie. Her hair was wind-swept and her little cheeks were red, as if she'd been running.\n\n\"Sweetheart.\" I put on my best stern, dad's-not-happy voice. \"I'm going to ask you a question, and I want you to be honest with me: Have you been playing along the path out back again?\"\n\nI didn't really need to ask the question, because I already knew the answer. Rosie is allowed to play in the garden on her own, and sometimes \u2013 if she asks us permission first \u2013 we let her ride her bike along the path at the back of our house. The one that runs past all the neighbour's back gardens. But that's *all* we allow her to do. This area is pretty safe, but these days you can never be too careful. There was a burglary a couple of roads over a few months back, and last year someone was mugged on the high street. Several years ago, a few towns over, a little boy even went missing. That was quite a long way away from here, of course, but it made national news for a few days until the search fizzled out. And it made a lot of parents more cautious. Rosie's getting older now, and she's an adventurous girl, but still \u2013 you have to have boundaries. And on a few occasions lately, Rosie's been crossing those boundaries. Riding her bike further than she should. Not coming in straight away when we call her. Sneaking out the back gate when she's only meant to be playing in the garden.\n\nAs I watched Rosie now, I noticed her face growing redder. She looked away from me, down at the kitchen floor, and scuffed her feet.\n\n\"Dad, I only went a *little* way down,\" she said. \"I *promise*. I was chatting to Mr Henderson, because I saw him in his back garden. I said hello and made him jump!\"\n\nI sighed. So there it was: Mr Henderson was Rosie's zombie. Yesterday it was the postman, and the day before that it was a different neighbour. I took a sip of tea and shook my head. Mr Henderson was, in fairness, a better candidate than the others. The guy lives on his own, and he looks about 100 years old. Moles all over his face. Skin like a deflated balloon. Whenever we'd chatted over the garden fence before, though, he'd always seemed nice enough. Just a bit lonely.\u00a0I couldn't have Rosie going round calling him a zombie.\n\n\"Listen to me, sweetheart. I know you didn't go far or anything, but I don't want you\u2013\"\n\n\"I came right back after too, dad!\" Rosie interrupted. She was staring up at me now, blue eyes large and pleading. \"I promise! And I even said no when Mr Henderson offered me an ice cream, because I know you don't like me taking stuff from strangers!\"\n\nI opened my mouth to respond, then paused. \"He offered you ice cream?\"\n\n\"Yeah, but I said no! Mr Henderson really wanted me to come in and have one, but I told him I had to get home! And then I came straight back here to tell you I'd seen a zombie, and I...\"\n\nRosie was babbling now, her voice whirring like a motor. But I'd stopped listening. My mind was still stuck on something she'd said a moment before.\n\n*Mr Henderson really wanted me to come in and have one*.\n\nI took another sip of tea and frowned. That wasn't good. I didn't mind the neighbours chatting to my little girl, but I didn't like the thought of them inviting her in. Not without us there. Not even if they were just kind, lonely old men. I made up my mind to go round and visit Mr Henderson later, and to tell him that myself \u2013 kindly, of course, but firmly.\u00a0\n\nIn the end, though, I didn't get a chance. Because a few moments after I'd had the thought, Rosie said something else. Something that pushed everything else from my mind, and ended any idea I might have had about going over to Mr Henderson's house. She said something that made me feel cold.\n\n\"Daddy, please don't stop me playing in the garden. I *promise* I won't sneak out again. I don't want the zombie to get me.\"\n\n\"Rosie, I'm not going to stop you playing in the garden. But you have to make *me* a couple of promises, too. First, promise me you'll stop going round calling people zombies. Mr Henderson my be old, but he's not one of the living dead.\"\n\nRosie frowned. \"I didn't.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, you didn't? You just ran in here a moment ago calling him one.\"\n\n\"No, I *didn't*. Mr Henderson's not a zombie. I saw the zombie in his house, but it wasn't him.\"\n\nI frowned. I had the mug raised to my lips to take another sip of tea, but now I put it down again. \"What do you mean, sweetheart? You saw someone else in his house?\"\n\n\"Yeah, the *zombie*, dad! I could see it pressed against his little basement window while I was talking to him.\"\n\nCold fingers ran up my spine. \"What?\"\n\n\"Yeah, it was *really* scary. Its face was all bashed up and bloody, and its mouth was open. Like it was screaming at me. But do you know what confused me most, dad?\"\n\nI tried to keep my voice steady. \"What?\"\n\n\"Well, I didn't realise *kids* could be zombies, too. I thought it was only grownups.

We were in her hospital room, the same one we\u2019d been in and out of for the last year and a half. Sometimes we had a roommate, sometimes we were alone. Always she held steady enough for both of us, the rock I tied my hope to, the wall against the grief I knew was coming.\n\nCancer is such a mundane word for something so hungry and cruel.

My mom tapped her bare scalp.\n\n\u201cRight there with you, tiger,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. Bradshaw smiled but I could tell he was burdened. I saw him glance at the small idol I\u2019d placed on my mother\u2019s nightstand. The talisman was a miniature oak tree carved from gray soapstone. There were four faces etched into the tree, a sentry against ill health and bitter spirits. I could tell the stone tree made the doctor uncomfortable. In all honesty, I had a tough time looking at the idol for more than a few seconds. The faces were each whittled in vivid expression. The face closest to my mother\u2019s bed was smiling kindly and the face pointed towards the door was snarling, meant to ward away harm.\n\nThe final two faces were both weeping. All four shapes were too human, too raw. There was a *weirdness* to the stone tree that put people on edge but I\u2019d grown used to every shade of weird you can imagine. My mother\u2019s side of the family was full of stories of unexplained luck and mysterious tragedy, whispered secrets and unexplained deaths. By all accounts, my maternal grandmother was either an honest-to-goodness witch or full-bore, high-caliber crazy, or both. *Probably* both.\n\nThe stone tree was from a box of my grandmother\u2019s things I\u2019d found in the attic earlier that month. Maybe it was just a coincidence, but my mom did seem to get a bit better when I\u2019d brought in the talisman, at least for a little while.\n\nI was daydreaming about family history and the odd box while Dr. Bradshaw checked his charts and mom\u2019s vitals.\n\n\u201cCan I talk to you for a moment?\u201d he asked, ripping me back to reality. Dr. Bradshaw tried to keep a light tone but I could tell he didn\u2019t have good news.\n\nThe hospital hallway smelled like ammonia and birthday cake. Someone must have had a party, maybe a patient, maybe a nurse. Strange how you remember the insignificant details while your world is crashing down around you.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Dr. Bradshaw told me. \u201cThe results came in this morning.

Hurt worse than I could stomach.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing left to try?\u201d I asked, fighting down the urge to throw up. \u201cAnything, experimental, untested, anything?\u201d\n\nDr. Bradshaw shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.

My hope wasn\u2019t dead yet. If medicine couldn\u2019t help my mom, maybe something older could. I thought of the box of my grandmother\u2019s things waiting in the attic. There was a lot in there I hadn\u2019t gone through yet, books and candles and secrets and lost things. Maybe there was a cure or at least a way to keep the fight going.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cIf all that\u2019s left is to make her comfortable, I want to take her home.\u201d\n\nThe doctor smiled. \u201cI understand. We can give you some medication, ways to help her with the pain.\u201d He put his hand on my shoulder. \u201cYour mom\u2019s been in a lot of pain but she\u2019ll have peace, soon.

There wasn\u2019t much in the way of neighbors besides some woods and a creek slithering through her yard. It was a windy, warm March afternoon when I took my dying mother home. That night I began my work. I was going to turn the house into a bunker, a maze Death could never solve. I would keep my mother safe, I would find a way to keep her alive.\n\nThe little red book was full of ideas. Running water was an obvious place to start. The creek behind the house was barely a trickle but it should provide some coverage to the south side of the property. Salt was next, lining the doorways and window frames, then in an unbroken circle around the entire house. This step was to be repeated daily, the red book stressed, or even multiple times per day. Even a moderate breeze played holy havoc with any salt poured outside so it was always best to trace and retrace every few hours. Water and salt were common defenses against man\u2019s oldest enemy and well known. The book offered other, less conventional, advice.\n\nIt took me nearly a week to finish carving the symbols and signs into the walls, the floors, even the trees on the property. Sometime around noon on the third day, on my back in the crawlspace etching strange marks onto the underside of the floor, it struck me how ridiculous I was acting. There was no proof that any of the information in the little red book was anything other than the delusional ramblings of a bizarre woman I\u2019d only met once or twice as a child. For all I knew, the runes meant to ward off Death were actually a grocery list written in Cantonese. But I was desperate, and every time I saw my mother she looked frailer, more fragile. So I continued carving and praying and building layers upon layers of protections to keep Death far away.\n\nMaking my marks took me all over the property. It was a big yard, nearly three acres that blended gradually into the surrounding forest. I wasn\u2019t able to pinpoint the exact boundary where cultivated met nature, the edges simply bled together, but I did my best to create a clean border with lines between the symbols. I\u2019d always loved the wildness here, the way you could wander a few hundred yards away from home and feel like you\u2019d traveled hundreds of years into the past to somewhere primal. This was the perfect playground for a kid, whether I was out exploring trails or trapping minnows or spending the summer building yet another treehouse, convinced this would be the final one. It never was, I was never satisfied.\n\nThe house itself, though small, was more than enough room for my mother and me. Dad died when I was seven. I don\u2019t remember much about him, just how big he seemed, with a bonfire grin and arms that I thought could hold the whole world. My mom often said I took after my father. I could see it in the old pictures of him, we had the same eyes, green as moss in the summer, and the same fiery shock of red hair, enemy to every comb on the planet. The sicker mom got the more often she called me by my father\u2019s name. I worried when she drifted away like that but a part of me was proud she\u2019d mistake me for him.\n\nAfter all of the symbols were carved there were a few steps left in the book to deter Death from visiting. There were dozens of charms and talismans in the bottom of the old box in the attic. I sat up there combing through everything my grandmother left behind, referencing the red book, pushing the tiny charms into tidy piles. None of the idols were larger than my thumb. Some were iron and others were wood, some were heavy, others light. All of them were uncomfortable to look at or touch.\n\nThe attic was drafty but not nearly enough to explain the cold that burrowed into me as I sorted the charms. I\u2019m not particularly tall but the attic felt like it was designed for dolls, beams so low I couldn\u2019t even walk bent over. I moved around on my knees, rough floorboards threatening splinters even through my jeans. I could have taken the box downstairs where I\u2019d have more room but the idea filled me with a deep unease. It seemed better to leave the box up in the attic, only taking down objects as I needed them. Up here, at least, my grandmother\u2019s items, her legacy was...quarantined.\n\nThe red book was very specific about the distribution of the totems around the house and property. I walked carefully through my mom\u2019s backyard, boots plopping in and out of mud, compass in hand. It had rained nearly every day since I\u2019d taken my mom home from the hospital. I knew it was almost certainly a coincidence but couldn\u2019t help wonder if the soft curtains of rain falling to the ground were for her. I placed charms in a compass rose with the house in the middle. The most disturbing objects were given places of honor at each cardinal direction.\n\nWater, salt, wards, charms, all placed carefully, intentionally. My grandmother\u2019s book promised that these would offer some degree of protection against the inevitability of Death. The symbols would confuse it, the talismans distract it, and the water and salt make barriers to slow it down. But Death might still find a crack to slip through, so the red book recommended one final trick.\n\nThere was a small candle in the bottom of the box, dirty white as stained paper. When I took the candle from its case the smell made me gag. Have you ever walked past a portable toilet in the dog days of summer? When it\u2019s so hot, the blue plastic has started to warp and bubble? Imagine that smell distilled into a finger\u2019s worth of wax. I brought the candle downstairs, placed it on the dining room table and set it alight.\n\nThe wick caught immediately, the flame burning an unusual red-brown. No heat came off of the candle and it actually seemed cooler the closer I moved my hand to the fire. Once the wax began to melt the smell was ten times worse than it was back in the attic. I choked down a greasy sickness crawling up my throat and quickly left the room, shutting the French doors as I went. That helped trap the odor but I couldn\u2019t shake the sense of nausea. I went to check on my mother.\n\n\u201cDo you remember the day you ran away?\u201d my mom asked, sitting in her bed, lunch untouched on the nightstand beside her.\n\nI didn\u2019t think she had any weight left to lose before she was nothing but bone and memory. Her skin was rice paper over a frame that seemed smaller every day. Her eyes, though, no matter how fragile the rest of her became, remained two little lanterns against the dark, blue and bright and alive.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t make it very far,\u201d I answered. \u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t really running away, only...stretching my legs.\u201d\n\nMom smiled. \u201cYou told me you were leaving for the circus. You wanted to be either a lion tamer or a strongman or maybe a fire-eater.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I wanted to be all of that combined. Young me was big on multitasking.\u201d\n\nMy mother turned so she was looking out the window into the yard. \u201cI was so scared when I found your note, the one saying you were leaving. My hands were shaking like you wouldn\u2019t believe when I called the sheriff and then Mr. Jonas down the way. It felt like we were searching for you for half the night, even though it couldn\u2019t have been more than an hour before we found you there, lost in the woods, wandering around and shivering. You hadn\u2019t even brought a jacket.\u201d\n\nI sat next to my mom on the bed. \u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t exactly plan ahead for my circus escape. I remember...I remember getting over the idea real quick but I couldn\u2019t find my way back. I\u2019m glad you found me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad, too,\u201d my mother said and I noticed her wipe away a tear. \u201cI\u2019m so glad. That hour you were gone, Brian, that was the most afraid I\u2019ve ever been. Afraid we wouldn\u2019t find you, afraid you might be hurt or worse. I couldn\u2019t hardly breathe through the fear. Then, suddenly, you were there and the relief nearly knocked me over. I think we stayed up together the rest of the night watching the stars. I wanted to make sure you could find the North Star in case you ever got lost again.\u201d\n\nShe turned back to me, reached out her thin hand and placed it over mine. There were still tears in her eyes but she smiled her lighthouse smile and, for a moment, I saw her just as she used to be, just as she was the night I ran away and my mom found me.\n\nI squeezed her hand. \u201cI was scared, too. I was afraid I\u2019d be stuck out there. What made you think of it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about dying lately and-\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cDon\u2019t talk like that. You\u2019re not going anywhere, not for a long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said, squeezing my hand back. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve known real fear and what I\u2019m feeling now...it\u2019s not like that. I\u2019m scared, I guess, but I\u2019m at peace with it. I had such a beautiful life. I\u2019m so glad I got to meet you, to be your mom.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad, too,\u201d I whispered, voice breaking on the last word.\n\n*But I won\u2019t let you go without a fight,* I added silently in my mind.\n\nSomething was trying to get to my mom. The strangeness began the day after I lit the candle. At first it was small blips, tiny *wrongs* that I chalked up to my imagination. Doors I knew I\u2019d closed at night were open in the morning. Food began to rot and spoil within days of me bringing it into the house. Eventually, food would go bad almost immediately. Every few hours the television in the living room would either turn off if it was running, or on if it was off.\n\nClocks would stop overnight, always at 3:03 am. Shadows began *sticking* to the corners of rooms independent of any light sources. The shadows were stubborn and they would linger for as long as I would stare, then disappear when I blinked. I began hearing bumps and knocks at all hours and sometimes, when I\u2019d enter an empty room, I had a sharp, fleeting certainty that it was only just occupied.\n\nI avoided the dining room except to check in twice a day to see if the candle was still burning. The smell was vicious and would claw its way into your throat and nostrils the moment it was given a chance. I kept the door to the room shut and kept air fresheners running in the surrounding rooms 24\/7. The funny thing was, the candle never went out, never even seemed to shrink. I could see the wax melting but day-in and day-out the candle refused to change.\n\nDays marched into weeks and the wrongness only grew deeper. My mom and I both lost sleep to vivid nightmares that we couldn\u2019t remember when we woke up. Only the echoes remained but those were enough to leave my pulse sprinting until morning. I started sleeping in a chair in my mother\u2019s room. I did this to comfort her if she woke up confused during the night but also because, if I\u2019m being honest, I was too scared to sleep alone. I felt like a child running into his parents\u2019 room, convinced there was a monster under the bed. Thing is...maybe there was.\n\nBy the third week I couldn\u2019t keep doors closed. They would slam open the moment I left the room. A terrible scratching began inside of the walls. I told my mom it might be squirrels or mice but the sound was so insistent, not like rodents milling about, more like a dog wanting in. I stopped leaving the house for supplies; instead, I had what little food we ate delivered. I kept the curtains drawn. There was tapping on the glass every night.\n\nAbout a month after leaving the hospital we were living like zombies. The dining room couldn\u2019t contain the smell of the candle anymore. The entire house was clogged with the scent. Tiny noises had graduated into full-on laughs and screams and whispers in the rooms around us. Something kicked the bathroom door so hard while I was taking a shower that the hinges warped. I covered every mirror in the house. I\u2019d started to see things in the corners looking back at me, half-hidden faces, shapes that skittered away as soon as I turned around. Mom was drifting further and further away. She had long moments of confusion where she\u2019d forget my name, forget where we were. Sometimes, she\u2019d think I was my dad. Other times, she\u2019d just stare at the wall for hours, growing fainter and fainter each day like a Polaroid left in the sun.\n\nBut she was alive.\n\nIt was clear that we were under siege by something. My world shrank to only one room and every trip to the bathroom or to answer the door for food felt like going over the trenches. The noises kept getting worse and worse, the shadows closer, the sense of movement around the house sharper. Every now and then I would feel hot breath on the back of my neck or walk through a cold patch hanging in the air. I stopped bothering redrawing the lines of salt around the house. I knew, deep in my bones, that as long as the sickly candle burned, Death could not take my mom away.\n\nOn the thirty-third day after leaving the hospital, I woke with a start from a nightmare, only to find my mom\u2019s bed empty. She hadn\u2019t been able to walk the past week at all, so my first feeling was hope that she might be improving, at least a little. Then I noticed the odor we\u2019d been living with for weeks was gone.\n\n\u201cMom!\u201d I shouted, running in bare feet out of the room.\n\nI found her in the dining room, the door wide open. She was standing at the table, frail as a neglected scarecrow, bobbing back and forth. Her hands were hovering over the candle. The flame was out.\n\n\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d I whispered. \u201cMom? Mom...are you okay?\u201d\n\nI padded into the room, the wooden floor freezing cold. My mother didn\u2019t react to my presence, she just continued rocking side-to-side. I realized she was still asleep.\n\n\u201cMom?\u201d I gently shook her shoulder. \u201cWake up.\u201d\n\nHer head snapped back and she nearly fell. I caught her on the way down. It felt like she weighed nothing at all.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked, looking around the dark room. \u201cWhere\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d I told her. \u201cYou were sleepwalking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was having the most unusual dream,\u201d mom mumbled. \u201cThere were so many stars and...\u201d\n\nShe began to shiver uncontrollably. The cold hit me a moment later. I let out a gasp. The house was chilly before but the dining room was near-arctic. My breath bloomed into a thin cloud in front of my face. I became acutely aware of the complete silence filling the house.\n\nThen I heard scratching. It was coming all throughout the house, deep tearing sounds at the walls around the dining room. Footsteps came immediately after, heavy and fast. Somewhere in the house a window shattered.\n\n\u201cBrian,\u201d my mother said, holding onto me.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I said, \u201ceverything will be-\u201d\n\nMy voice deserted me as a massive shadow unfolded in the corner of the room. It was shaped like a man but tall, so very tall. And it was fast. Before I could yell the shadow was on us, pouring over my mother. In the space of a heartbeat, she was simply gone.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I whispered, clawing at the dissolving shadow where my mom used to be. \u201cNo, no, no, no, NO.\u201d\n\nThe shadow was disappearing like a puddle sinking into the floor. There was a texture to it, oily and too slick to hold.\n\nI thought of my mother the night she found me lost in the woods, the night I\u2019d run away. Her face filled my memory, her lighthouse smile. I remembered the relief I felt when she found me, the overwhelming love. I held onto that feeling, clutching it close.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have her,\u201d I whispered.\n\nI closed my fist around the last threads of the shadow. There was a terrible sensation of *pulling*. It was like I\u2019d caught a horse by the tail and it was trying to shake me. But I held on.\n\nA sense of ripping and being dragged. It was a riptide with a mind of its own. But I held on. It could not shake me.\n\nThe temperature was dropping every second and I felt my vision growing dark. The last thought that ran through my head before I blacked out was a promise to myself that even if I died, my grip would hold. I wouldn\u2019t let my mother\u2019s life slip away. All sounds and light faded, narrowing to a pinprick and then going black.\n\nI woke up under a field of stars. I was lying in soft grass, still wearing my pajama bottoms and an old t-shirt. It was cool, wherever I was, but comfortably so. I stood up. There were trees all around me, tall and close, stitched together with shadows. Immediately to my right, there was a road that ran straight as far as I could see, blurring into the horizon. But the stars, they were like nothing I\u2019d ever seen before.\n\nBright ribbons of northern lights rippled above me in green and blue and purple. Stars lit the sky like millions of lanterns floating on a still ocean. The moon shone sharpest of all, a spotlight hanging above the treeline, so close I thought I could stretch up and brush its face.\n\n\u201c***You are*** ***persistent***,\u201d said a voice from the forest behind me.\n\nI whipped around but couldn\u2019t see anyone. Then a dark spot began to clarify against the gloom. The silhouette separated itself and moved towards me. I recognized it instantly as the shadow from the dining room. As it moved closer, the thing grew and grew until it touched the sky and filled my vision. A deep dread sank into me but I stood my ground.\n\n\u201cGive me back my mom,\u201d I shouted.\n\nThe silhouette pulled away from the sky and then it was standing in front of me, the shape and size of a tall man. But instead of a shadow, the thing had wrapped itself in stars. Miniature constellations drifted across its body, floating slowly like a timelapse of a clear night sky. Burning brightest was the North Star, blue and warm. The space between the stars was absolute black, not a shadow but a complete absence of light. It was the most beautiful, terrifying thing I\u2019d ever seen.\n\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d I whispered.\n\n***\u201cYou know,\u201d*** it replied.\n\n\u201cGive her back,\u201d I begged. \u201cPlease, give her back.\u201d\n\n***\u201cI can\u2019t. It\u2019s her time. Past her time. You delayed me. Delayed her.\u201d***\n\nI clenched my fists. \u201cShe didn\u2019t get enough time. *I* didn\u2019t get enough time. It\u2019s not right, it\u2019s not fair.\u201d\n\n***\u201cOf course it\u2019s not fair,\u201d*** the starry thing said, ***\u201cbut it is right. You each have your time, and at the end of it, there\u2019s me, and there is a road, and we walk it together.\u201d***\n\n\u201cWhere to?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhere are you taking her?\u201d\n\n***\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not for me to know, only to know how to get there.\u201d***\n\n\u201cThen I won\u2019t let you take her.\u201d I planted myself in the road. The world was still and solemn around us. The constellations drifted like clouds and a soft breeze stirred the branches.\n\nThe starry thing didn\u2019t respond for a moment.\n\n***\u201cYour mother was kind and caring. Wherever she goes, she\u2019ll have peace,\u201d*** it promised.\n\n\u201cBut-\u201d\n\nThe creature raised its hand. ***\u201cDid you ever stop to think that death isn\u2019t an enemy? Death simply*** **is.** ***It is the natural partner to life. It knows no prejudice or malice, has no designs or ambitions. Your mother spent so long suffering, felt so much pain. Instead of letting her rest, you took it upon yourself to draw her life beyond its given course. You kept her alive but at the cost of stretching her thin, prolonging her sickness, diluting her. Did you keep her alive for her benefit or for yours?\u201d***\n\nI couldn\u2019t answer.\n\n***\u201cStretching a life is unnatural, dangerous,\u201d*** it told me. ***\u201cIn the weeks you kept me away you drew the attention of old things, hungry things, forces that would like nothing better than to swallow even the memory of your mother, to tear and bite until there was nothing left but pain and fear and a perfect emptiness.\u201d***\n\nI shuddered remembering the clawing sounds, the shattered window, and the laughter from empty rooms.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whispered. \u201cAre they...can they hurt her here? Is she safe?\u201d\n\nThe stars in the shadow burned brighter for a moment. ***\u201cYour mother won\u2019t walk her road alone. None of you do. I walk with you, always, to the end.\u201d***\n\n\u201cCan I see her?\u201d I asked. \u201cPlease? Just, I...let me say goodbye.\u201d\n\nIt considered for several seconds. ***\u201cYou are persistent.\u201d***\n\nAnd then the starry thing was gone. I was standing alone on an empty road.\n\n\u201cBrian?\u201d\n\nI turned to find my mother behind me on the road. She looked younger, healthier than I\u2019d seen her in years. The frailty was gone and my mother seemed exactly as I remembered her when she found me in the woods all those years ago.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this the most beautiful dream?\u201d she asked, staring up at the night sky.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, trying to keep my voice steady. \u201cA beautiful dream. I love you, mom. I love you so much, so very much.\u201d\n\nShe smiled and touched my cheek. \u201cI love you, too. Don\u2019t cry, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll wake up any time now. I\u2019ll see you then.\u201d\n\nI nodded, wiping at tears. \u201cSure, yeah, I\u2019ll see you then.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you think is at the end of the road?\u201d she asked. \u201cDo you think I\u2019ll have time to find out before I wake up?\u201d\n\nI looked out at the road, scanning the trees for any hungry shadows. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know where it goes but...promise me you\u2019ll be careful.\u201d\n\nMy mom smiled wider. \u201cOf course I\u2019ll be careful.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd she won\u2019t walk alone,\u201d said a familiar voice behind us both.\n\nI turned, expecting the starry thing. But the man standing on the road was entirely normal. The light from the moon was enough that I could see he had moss green eyes and a bright shock of red hair.\n\n\u201cSuch a beautiful dream,\u201d my mother said.\n\nThe man came towards us and took my mother\u2019s hand. He and I looked so alike, I could see why my mother confused us when she was sick.\n\n\u201cTake care of her,\u201d I told the man. \u201cI\u2026just please take care of her, make sure she gets where she\u2019s going. There are, well, there are things out there that want her, to hurt her, it\u2019s, it\u2019s my fault, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry-\u201d\n\nThe man squeezed my shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019ll be safe, watched over. If the Devil himself is waiting on the road ahead *he\u2019ll move.* Or he\u2019ll be moved.\u201d\n\nI believed him.\n\nThoughts raced through my head. There were so many things I wanted to say, questions, a million ways to say goodbye. I wanted to stretch out the moment for as long as I could but I realized I\u2019d already delayed my mother enough.\n\n\u201cI love you,\u201d I told them both. \u201cGoodbye.\u201d\n\nI woke up back in my dining room sitting at the table, the unlit candle in front of me. The house was quiet and still. There was no more scratching, no sound or sense of life at all. I walked through every room. The house was empty. I was alone.\n\nI\u2019ve spent the past couple months working on the house, erasing the marks I\u2019d made, fixing up the property. Some nights I take long walks out into the forest. I\u2019m far enough out in the country that on clear nights it\u2019s like looking up at a sea of stars. I think about my parents the most during those walks, I grieve and remember in my own way. And I wonder where their road went, if they\u2019re still traveling or if they reached their destination.\n\nI hope that their road takes them strange and beautiful places. When I walk at night, I look up for the North Star to keep from getting lost. Maybe they do the same.\n\nWhen it\u2019s full, I also look up towards the moon. I wonder if my parents had a chance to visit, to search for hidden oceans. I like to think they did, that the moon has at least one Maria, the one I love most.\n\n[GTM](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Grand_Theft_Motto\/comments\/emzy3b\/the_stories\/)\n\n[Hello](https:\/\/travisbrownwriting.com)"},"220":{"title":"My dead girlfriend keeps messaging me on Facebook.

I just received another message, and it\u2019s worse than any of the others. \n\nMy girlfriend died on the 7th of August, 2012. She was involved in a three car collision driving home from work when someone ran a red light. She passed away within minutes on the scene.\n\nWe had been dating for five years at that point. She wasn\u2019t big on the idea of marriage (it felt archaic, she said, gave her a weird vibe), but if she had been, I would have married her within three months of our relationship. She was vibrant; the kind of girl that would choose dare every time. She was happiest when camping, but a total technophile too. She always smelled like cinnamon.\n\nThat being said, she wasn\u2019t perfect. She always said something along the lines of, \u201cIf I kark it first, don\u2019t just say good things about me. I\u2019ve never liked that. If you don\u2019t pay me out, you\u2019re doing me a disservice. I\u2019ve got so many flaws, and that\u2019s just part of me.\u201d So, this is for Em: the music she said she liked and the music she actually liked were very different. Her idea of affection was a side-hug. She had really long toes, like a chimpanzee. \n\nI know that\u2019s tangential, but I don\u2019t feel right discussing her without you having an idea of what she was like. \n\nOnto the meat. Em had been dead for approaching thirteen months when she first messaged me. \n\n---\n[**September 4, 2013.**](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/UMh0nZl.png) This is when it began. I had left Emily\u2019s Facebook account activated so I could send her the occasional message, post on her wall, go through her albums. It felt too final (and too un-Emily) to memorialise it. I \u2018share\u2019 access with her mother (Susan) - meaning, her mother has her login and password and has spent a total of approximately three minutes on the website (or on a computer, total). After a little confusion, I assumed it was her.\n\n---\n[**November 16th, 2013.**](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/y0yzVaj.png) I had received confirmation from Susan that she hadn\u2019t logged in to Em\u2019s Facebook since the week of her death. Em knew a lot of people, so I instantly assumed this was one of her more tech savvy \u2018friends\u2019 fucking with me in the worst possible way. \n\nI noticed pretty much immediately that whoever was chatting with me was recycling old messages from [Em and my\u2019s shared chat history.](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/fw80ZJG.png)\n\nThe \u2018the wheels on the bus' comment was from when we were discussing songs to play on a road trip that never eventuated. \u2018hello\u2019 happened a million times.\n\n---\nAround **February 2014**, Emily started tagging herself in my photos. I would get notifications for them, but the tag would generally always be removed by the time I got to it. The first time I actually caught one, it felt like someone had punched me in the gut. \u2018She\u2019 would tag herself in spaces where it was plausible for her to be, or where she would usually hang out. I\u2019ve got screenshots of two (from April and June; these are the only ones I\u2019ve caught, so they\u2019re a little out of the timeline I\u2019m trying to write out):\n\nhttp:\/\/i.imgur.com\/X9G5agJ.png\n\nhttp:\/\/i.imgur.com\/55FwXKt.png\n\nAround this period of time, I stopped being able to sleep. I was too angry to sleep. \n\nShe would tag herself in random photos every couple of weeks. The friends who noticed and said something thought it was a fucked up bug; I found out recently that there have been friends who have noticed and didn\u2019t say anything. Some of them have removed me from their Facebook friends list.\n\nAt this point, some of you may be wondering why I didn\u2019t just kill my Facebook profile. I wish I had. I did for a little while. On days when I can\u2019t get out there, though, it\u2019s nice having my friends available to chat. It\u2019s nice visiting Em\u2019s page when the little green circle isn\u2019t next to her name. I was already socially reclusive when Em was alive; her death turned me into something pretty close to a hermit, and Facebook and MMOs were (are) my only real social outlets.\n\n---\n[On **March 15th,**](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/KIL2Mx5.png) I sent what I assumed was Em's hacker a message.\n\n---\n[**On March 25th**, I received an \u2018answer\u2019.](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/j3HwZzv.png)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I was going over these logs a few months later that I noticed she was recycling my own words as well.\n \nMy response seems kind of lacklustre here. I was intentionally providing him\/her with emotional \u2018bait\u2019 (\u2018This is actually devastating\u2019) to keep them interested in their game; I was working off the assumption that the kind of person to do this would be the kind of person that would thrive on the distress of others. I was posting in tech forums, looking for ways to track this person, contacting Facebook. I needed to keep them around so I could gather \u2018evidence\u2019.\n\nBefore anyone asks, yes, I had changed the password and all security info countless times.\n\n---\n[**16th of April.** I receive this.](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/uvadlGa.png)\n\nThis seems like word salad. Like all our conversations so far, it\u2019s recycled from previous messages she\u2019s sent.\n\n---\n[**29th of April.**](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/FGmhuUQ.png)\n\nI hadn\u2019t discovered any leads. Facebook had told me the locations her page had been accessed from, but since her death, they\u2019re all places I can account for (my home, my work, her mum\u2019s house, etc). My response here wasn\u2019t bait. \u2018yo ask Nathan\u2019 was an in-joke too lame worth explaining, but seeing \u2018her\u2019 say it again just absolutely fucking crippled me. My reaction in real life was much less prettier. I\u2019m not expecting my bond back.\n\nHer last few messages had started to scare me, but I wouldn\u2019t admit it at this point.\n\n---\n[**8th of May.** I don\u2019t really have the words for this.](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/GNL8TcO.png)\n\n\u2018FRE EZIN G\u2019 is the first original word she\u2019s (?) made. This has given me nightmares that have only started to kick in recently. I keep dreaming that she\u2019s in an ice cold car, frozen blue and grey, and I\u2019m standing outside in the warmth screaming at her to open the door. She doesn\u2019t even realise I\u2019m there. Sometimes her legs are outside with me.\n\n---\n[**24th of May.**](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/z295fHw.png)\n\nI wasn\u2019t actually drunk. She wasn\u2019t an affectionate girl, and it always embarrassed her to exchange \u2018I love you\u2019s, cuddle, talk about how much we meant to each other. She was more comfortable with it when I was boozed up. I got fake-drunk a lot.\n\nHer reply is what prompted me to finally memorialise her page, thinking it might help curb this behaviour. It might seem innocuous compared to her previous message - it\u2019s pasted from an old conversation where I was trying to convince her to let me drive her home from a friend\u2019s. \n\nIn the collision, the dashboard had crushed her. She was severed in a diagonal line from her right hip to midway down her left thigh. One of her legs was found tucked under the backseat. \n\n---\n[**Going back in time. 7th of August, 2012.**](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ujUNJQm.png)\n\nThese are logs from the day she died. She was usually home from work by 4.30. This, alongside a couple of voicemail messages, is the last time I talked to her under the assumption that she was alive. You\u2019ll see why I\u2019m showing you these soon.\n\n---\n[**Yesterday. 1st of July, 2014.**](http:\/\/imgur.com\/W6qzAZI)\n\nI memorialised her page a couple of days after I received the message about walking. Until today, she\u2019d been quiet; she wasn\u2019t even tagging herself in my photos. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do anymore. Do I kill her memorial page? What if it is her? I want to puke. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. \n\nI just heard a Facebook alert. I'm too afraid to swap windows and check it.\n"},"221":{"title":"Something went wrong with my heart transplant","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/8wu3y1\/something_went_wrong_with_my_heart_transplant\/","flair":null,"author":"KatrinCiernan","selftext":"I\u2019ve always had a weak heart.\n\nNot just physically, I\u2019ve always been afraid of my own shadow. It was unsurprising when the doctors told me my heart murmur wasn\u2019t just a heart murmur. A year of tests. A year of therapy, constant trips to the hospital and I was finally told that it had all been for nothing.\n\nMy poor weak heart wouldn\u2019t last till Christmas. It\u2019s a strange thing being told that you\u2019re dying; I didn\u2019t come to terms with it at first. I drank and I spent my money. I did reckless, stupid things because I was so damn scared.\n\nThen I got the news. That a young woman called Laura had been declared brain dead and that I, the lucky chosen one, would be getting a brand new heart a week later. I drove to the hospital slowly, carefully, and readied myself for the ordeal that was to come.\n\nAs I was laying in bed on the last night, the thought of Laura swirled around in my head and it wouldn\u2019t leave me alone. It was like her name was in flashing lights every time I closed my eyes.\n\nIt was wrong, I know it was, but I had to see the woman who was giving me her heart. It didn\u2019t feel right not to put a face to the one who was saving my life. I knew her name, I knew what ward she was staying on- I had overheard the two nurses discussing it. I wandered down the meandering hallways until I found what I was looking for, taking my time, making sure I didn\u2019t miss any name. I guess I had time on my hands now.\n\nIn the second to last room, she lay in bed. A woman sat on the bed next to her, holding her hand, and my own weak heart stuttered.\n\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d I had no idea what to say to her. \u201cI\u2019m Jenna. I\u2019m the person\u2026 I\u2019m having surgery tomorrow and..\u201d What I assumed was Laura\u2019s mother stood up and I could tell from the look in her eye that she knew who I was.\n\n\u201cThank you for visiting. I know it\u2019s strange, but a part of her is going to be living on in you. I wanted to meet you.\u201d I stood there, helpless and lost for words. Laura\u2019s mother beckoned me over.\n\n\u201cPlease.\u201d She said. \u201cDon\u2019t feel uncomfortable. Its what she would have wanted.\u201d I sat on the chair next to Laura.\n\n\u201cHow did she-\u201c I broke off. It was too awful to ask. Laura\u2019s mother gave me a thin smile.\n\n\u201cShe was a care worker. Looked after battered wives, abused women. Last month she met a guy and\u2026 Well. I suppose years of training can\u2019t help you when you\u2019re in love. She ignored the warning signs. And he killed her. She dedicated her life to those who needed her.\u201d Laura\u2019s mother looked down. I don\u2019t know why I did it, but I reached over, and held Laura\u2019s hand. I squeezed it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I had a boyfriend once who\u2026 He was like that too. Someone like Laura convinced me to leave.\u201d Laura\u2019s mother gave me another half smile. I could see the tears in her eyes.\n\nThen Laura squeezed my hand. Tightly. She gripped me so hard that her fingernails dug into my skin. I recoiled, a look of horror on my face. Laura\u2019s mother looked at me calmly.\n\n\u201cShe squeezes my hand sometimes as well. I think the Doctors called it muscle spasms. Either way. There\u2019s none of Laura left in there anymore.\u201d I looked at the small crescent moons that had just started to bleed on the palm of my hand.\n\nThe surgery went perfectly. I was wheeled to the recovery suite after it was over and done with, the raised wound on my chest covered by gauze. It was better if I didn\u2019t see it, I thought. I didn\u2019t need any more heart issues. I spent the first day doped up on the pain medication, eating only a little and sitting up maybe two times. It was a long process, they reassured me.\n\nLaura\u2019s mother came to visit me the day before I was due to leave. Her calm demeanor hadn\u2019t wavered but I could see that she was suffering. She looked ten years older, and her hands shook when she gave me a hug.\n\n\u201cWhen are you going home?\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow.\u201d I told her. \u201cPlease, come visit whenever you want.\u201d I started to jot down my address for her, when out of the corner of my eye, a flash of blonde disappeared through the doorway. The same brilliant blonde as Laura\u2019s hair.\n\n\u201cOw!\u201d I cried out suddenly. It felt like someone had sharply squeezed my hand so hard it had almost crushed the bones. Laura\u2019s mother rushed to my side, a look of concern in her eyes.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is it your heart?\u201d She stumbled over the last words, coming to terms with what she had said. I tried to reassure her and said I\u2019d let the doctors know, and she left with a look of worry on her face.\n\nWhen I looked down, a new set of crescent fingernail marks were below the ones that Laura\u2019s had made. Ten identical bleeding smiles.\n\nThe taxi ride home was short, and before I knew it I was back in my own flat. It felt strange to try and slot back into where I had left off, my life had been almost over the last time I had been here. I looked over the mess and the cardboard boxes, the remnants of one night where I had tearfully tried to pack and store my belongings so my parents wouldn\u2019t have to do it when I died.\n\nLaura\u2019s heart beat so strongly it felt like it would come out of my chest. It did this all the time, and I realized this was what a healthy heart must feel like. So why couldn\u2019t I shake my feeling of unease?\n\nThat night, I had a dream.\n\nLaura was in her hospital bed, but her mother was gone. I could hear my heart, Laura\u2019s heart, beating in my eardrums so loudly it was painful. I tried to cover them, but my hands were pinned to my sides. Some unexplainable force was moving me towards the motionless figure of Laura on the bed, her lips were blue and the window had come open, whipping her blonde hair around her face.\n\nI was almost on top of her when her eyes flew open.\n\nThey were milky white, the eyes of someone dead.\n\n\u201cGet out.\u201d She rasped, her voice guttural. I could hear the heartbeat faster and faster, drumming until I thought I couldn\u2019t take it anymore.\n\nThen I woke up. The sound had been real. Laura\u2019s heart was so loud it felt like it would rupture my eardrums and I screamed in agony, trying to cover my ears. It was useless, it was coming from some deep place inside me, I could feel it reverberating around the hollows of my chest.\n\nI stumbled out of bed, gasping for air, and tried to find my phone. I needed to call someone, anyone, an ambulance or my mom. Anyone that would pick up.\n\n\u201cGet out.\u201d It was a faint whisper over the hammering thumps of Laura\u2019s heart, a low guttural voice that sounded like it had been made by an animal, and I crawled to the door, down the hallway, choking on my screams for help. My neighbor opened the door, his eyes as wide as saucers at the sight of me on the floor clutching my chest.\n\nHe drove me to hospital as I cried in the passenger seat of his car.\n\nAfter about fifty different checkups, the doctors told me that absolutely nothing was wrong with me. They told me my heart was regular, my blood pressure was normal, and that everything was going just swimmingly. I stood in the waiting area, wallowing in my shame and frustration.\n\nThat heart didn\u2019t belong to me.\n\nMy phone buzzed on the counter, an unknown number. Great. That was all I needed, more unexplained, scary things like a stranger on the end of the phone. My voice sounded small on the line,\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood morning, this is the Thames Valley police, we\u2019ve called to report an incident that occurred in your flat at around 1.30am today.\u201d I felt a wave of embarrassment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I recently had surgery and I wasn\u2019t feeling well. I had to have my neighbor drive me to the hospital and I think I panicked a little in the hallway before I left.\u201d There was a small silence on the other end of the phone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid this is something you might want to be sitting down for.\u201d I felt Laura\u2019s heart beats, strong and calm. \u201cThere was an incident of forced entry by Mr Samuel Matthews, according to our police records he\u2019s your ex partner and you filed a restraining order against him in September 2017.\u201d My blood ran cold.\n\n\u201cI did.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s in police custody. We found an automatic weapon on him and we believe he had the intent to harm you. We have an officer currently stationed at your flat who can fill you in depending on how long your hospital stay will be.\u201d\n\nI thanked him and hung up the phone.\n\nFor a moment, I leant against the wall, the horror slowly spreading over me. If I had been in my flat ten minutes later he would have found me.\n\nLaura\u2019s heartbeats filled my ears again but now they were gentle, calming. Her mother said she dedicated every part of her to helping those who needed it.\n\nI put both my hands on my chest, overwhelmed by my own gratitude, and listened to Laura."},"222":{"title":"I knew a woman who never took off her wedding dress","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/f4fhyv\/i_knew_a_woman_who_never_took_off_her_wedding\/","flair":null,"author":"poloniumpoisoning","selftext":"Pauline was a sweet woman who lived across the street. We weren\u2019t close as kids or teenagers because she was around five years older than me, but our parents were friends. I think she babysat me when I was younger too.\n\nWhen my mother learned that Pauline was engaged, she sent me to help on the bridal shower. Poor mom, she thought I was like that because I was too often around boys and needed to learn to be more feminine, but she\u2019s got that backwards.\n\nThat\u2019s when I first learned that Pauline and her soon-to-be husband had made a blood oath.\n\n\u201cThe first to die comes and takes the other as soon as they can\u201d, she explained to me, swirling the ruby ring gently around her fingers.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that too dramatic? What if you end up divorcing and marrying other people?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t. We are soulmates!\u201d she assured me. Her na\u00efvet\u00e9 made her incredibly beautiful, but it felt really wrong being 21 and thinking that I was so much more mature than a 26 years-old.\n\nI didn\u2019t pursue the matter, but she kept talking about him in a dreamy tone. *Aiden would like this*, *I wish Aiden was here*, and so on. Her dreamy tone almost made me believe that soulmates existed and that you could make the person you love the most follow you in death by just willing it.\n\nI met Pauline\u2019s friends, and we all ended up having some quality girl time. Pauline explained to us all how she believed that you can wake up in the afterlife and start controlling things with your mind.\n\n\u201cOf course your memories will be hazy\u201d, she clarified. \u201cBut that\u2019s why we made the blood oath. So we can remember.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how will one get the other back?\u201d I asked, entertaining her.\n\n\u201cI like to believe that we\u2019ll both grow wings!\u201d\n\nIt was all terribly silly when I think back, but Pauline had something about her that made everyone pay attention and marvel at her words.\n\nDespite the age gap, we ended up becoming good friends; I think we were finally at an age where it didn\u2019t matter anymore. Since I was in college but lived with my parents and didn\u2019t need to work, I had a lot of spare time to accompany her to wedding dress fittings, cake tasting and all the little things that were the world for brides.\n\nBut Pauline was a pleasant bride-to-be and never freaked out; she was just thrilled about marrying the man of her dreams, and wanted to make it pretty if possible.\n\nLittle by little, I grew to understand her devotion to Aiden. And he was just as crazy about her, if not more. When they were together the world felt like a brighter and warmer place. Like marshmallows slowly melting over my heart.\n\nThe day of the wedding came, around half a year after her bridal shower.\n\nIt was neither a big nor a small wedding \u2013 it felt like both Pauline and Aiden were able to invite exactly everyone they wanted around on their happiest day. Not one more, not one less. I felt somewhat honored to be there.\n\nStill, the happiest day never came.\n\nWhen Pauline arrived, belated as any bride should, there was whispering and disquiet; Aiden wasn\u2019t there yet. \n\nHer smile didn\u2019t falter, because she was completely sure that he would never bail on her. But I could tell she was worried. The bridesmaids \u2013 her two closest friends since high school \u2013 started making calls to try to find out if the groom had a sudden illness.\n\nSoon they realized that Aiden\u2019s parents were there, but not his brother. They informed that their other son was supposed to drive the groom as part of his best man\u2019s duties.\n\nWhen the devastating news came, everyone wanted to comfort her, everyone wanted desperately to protect her precious heart, but it was too torn apart to notice anyone else.\n\n*It was all too fast and scary. (\u2026) A sports car ran a red light straight into the Mirage. (\u2026) The man in the passenger seat was dead on arrival. (\u2026) The driver was taken to the hospital but his state was critical.*\n\nIt was all so hard on everyone. Aiden\u2019s brother ended up surviving, but he\u2019ll be tetraplegic for life due to severe injury on his spinal cord. As far as I know, he\u2019s also miserable because he wished he could be the one who died.\n\nRight after the wedding that never happened, Pauline and Aiden\u2019s parents dealt with selling the house they had just bought, and Pauline continued living with her parents. They both still worked office jobs, so her other friends and I started taking turns keeping her company while they weren\u2019t home.\n\nI did my best to be there for my neighbor and friend, but *she* wasn\u2019t there. She was living in delusion, and the only thing you could see leaking into reality was her desolation. \n\nI never saw such a deep and heart-wrenching sadness. Pauline refused to take off her dress. She would spend the whole day by the window waiting for Aiden and the whole night crying because she missed him desperately. Every single day.\n\nShe was hopeful it was a matter of time until he woke up on the other side and remembered to bring her along. That\u2019s why she wouldn\u2019t take off the dress \u2013 he had died on his wedding suit, so it was only natural that she was up to par.\n\nHer parents and every single one of her friends tried to coax her into changing her clothes. We promised she could always keep the dress close for when Aiden came, but she knew that we didn\u2019t really believe he would. It was like promising your kid that you\u2019d buy them a Happy Meal some other day. \n\nNo one dared to penetrate her grief and force her out of the dress. She spent the day in it, slept in it, even bathed in it; since we live in a warm and arid weather, having it dry wasn\u2019t an issue, only everything else.\n\nThe once beautiful organza and silk were now ragged, grimy and smelling. But she still refused to take it off. She started to believe that Aiden wouldn\u2019t be able to spot her in the crowd if she wasn\u2019t wearing it.\n\nIt was impossible to change her mind, and even though she was seeing a therapist three times a week, she wasn\u2019t improving. Her mourning and PTSD were turning into a darker, more permanent mental illness.\n\nShe started talking to Aiden, then explained to us that he was nearby, so she could feel him coming. He was just taking a while because flying is really hard when your wings are newly-acquired.\n\nThen one morning, she disappeared for good. No one saw her leaving, and no one saw her at all after that.\n\nThe only thing that we were able to find, in the small grove behind the house, was her filthy wedding dress. It had two large holes poked on her back, like it had grown wings.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAfter finding the dress, everyone who loved Pauline was relieved; her mother readily admitted that she actually believed that Aiden somehow had come back to take her. Others weren\u2019t so fond of the supernatural explanation, but thinking that there was a chance that it happened brought us a sense of closure.\n\nIt\u2019s not that we were happy about her death, but we conformed to the possibility of her finally finding her peace.\n\nShe was an angel, after all. Why wouldn\u2019t she grow wings and escape her flesh prison?\n\nThe family held a beautiful memorial service in her honor, and slowly we all started moving on with our lives.\n\nNow, you might ask what I believe in. I would laugh bitterly because I don\u2019t have this choice to begin with.\n\nBeing the person who spent the most time watching Pauline those days, it was only natural that I was the one to found her dead in the bathtub. Hiding and subsequently getting rid of her body was the hardest thing I have ever done; tampering with the dress, though, was eerily healing.\n\nStill, I think that she would be pleased to know that I faked her rapture. \n\nA romantic and mystifying death fitted her way more than suicide[.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PPoisoningTales\/)"},"223":{"title":"My girlfriend talks in her sleep.

Far from it.  I would think about her every moment she was away.  I would sometimes sit on my couch and just stare at my phone waiting for her to text.  I\u2019d tell myself \u201cDon\u2019t contact her.  *Don't*.   It will come off as too strong.\u201d  But then I\u2019d still find myself clicking her name on my contact list before my inner voice would continue, \u201cYou don\u2019t want her to know how desperately smitten you are with her.  It\u2019s unattractive.  It will scare her off.  No, you must wait for her to call you this time.\u201d\n\nBut it was excruciating and exhausting.  Almost unbearable.  I once heard that the ancient Greeks believed that falling madly and irrationally in love with somebody was a curse that you would wish upon your enemies.  I could never understand what they meant.  After all, isn\u2019t falling head over heels in love the ultimate goal nowadays?  But now that it\u2019s happened to me, I have to say\u2026 the ancient Greeks were right.  This is a curse.  I was barely in control of myself.  Almost as though my infatuation with her had\u2026 possessed me.\n\nThe two of us were sexually active together but still in the \u201cdating\u201d phase.  We were at that make or break era of a blossoming relationship where we\u2019d either have \u201cthe talk\u201d and formally be in a relationship or we\u2019d start to slowly drift apart.  The latter of which I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to cope with.  Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t be able to.  Almost everything about her captivated me.  The way she held her hand over her mouth when she laughed.  How she\u2019d caress the pendant of her necklace when she was frightened.  How she\u2019d twirl her hair in her finger when she was excited.   All of it.  Her smell.  Her smile.  Her eyes.  \n\nYeah, I know.  It probably makes you sick reading about it.  I feel the same way.  I was never the hopeless romantic type.  But now I can\u2019t stop fantasizing about her.  I\u2019d think about us doing the long three-hour hike up to that magnificent view from one of our first dates.  To that first kiss, as we overlooked the lights of the city.  But this time I\u2019d get down on one knee, bring out the ring, and\u2026 well\u2026 you know what would happen next.  \n\nAlright, fine.  I\u2019ll stop.  Yes, this is a girl I\u2019d only been casually dating for a couple of months.  I shouldn\u2019t be thinking about proposing yet.  I know that.  I'm just barely able to control myself any longer.  I feel as though I\u2019m losing power over the decisions I make. \n\nAnd that brings me to why I\u2019m here writing this out at the moment.  It started with the first real thing that troubled me about her. We\u2019d never actually spent a night together.  No matter how late she was over, once either of us showed signs of being tired, she\u2019d up and leave.  She wouldn\u2019t leave awkwardly or in anger. Just a casual kiss good night, a smile, and a \u201ccall me soon\u201d. \n\nIt was something I didn\u2019t really even notice the first few times she did it.  But after almost 8 weeks of dating, it was becoming strange.  I\u2019d have to ask her about it.\n\nIt took drinking almost an entire bottle of wine before I had the courage to do it.  She looked almost defeated when I asked and lowered her eyes in embarrassment.  \u201cI knew this talk would come eventually,\u201d She started.  She took in a deep breath with a long drawn out exhale.  \u201cRecently\u2026.\u201c  she paused again.  \u201cI\u2019ve started talking in my sleep.\u201d  She shook her head in embarrassment.    \u201cIt\u2019s called somniloquy, I looked it up.\u201d  \n\nI shrugged and laughed out loud.  My demeanor seemed to say \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Stephen\u2026 listen\u201d she said.  She wasn\u2019t laughing.  \u201cIt\u2019s bad.  It\u2026 It\u2019s completely out of control.  It\u2019s not just random words or gibberish.  No.  It\u2019s horrible.  I say horrible disgusting things.\u201d  She was starting to raise her voice, breath heavy,  and tear up.\n\nI approached her and held her.  I told her it couldn\u2019t be that bad.  I told her to spend the night.  I told her she was probably exaggerating.  \n\nI was wrong.\n\nThat night she stayed at my house.  But she warned me of something before falling asleep.  \u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t wake me up.  It makes me really scared and disoriented if that happens.  And don\u2019t respond to me.  Just ignore it.\u201d  I nodded and agreed.   \u201cIf it becomes too much,\u201d she continued, \u201cjust leave the room and sleep on the couch.  I won\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\nI told her not to worry about it. I told her that it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal.  I told her I wouldn\u2019t leave to the couch.  I\u2019d stay beside her in the bed.\n\nBut I was wrong.\n\nI couldn\u2019t even last one night.\n\n***\n\nWe both fell asleep without incident.  I don\u2019t know how many hours passed, but I woke up in the dark with the sensation that someone was watching me.  And then I remembered\u2026 *She* was with me.  She was actually spending the night.  I smiled.\n\nBut then I noticed the shadowy outline of her sitting up on the bed.  She was looking down at me.  Staring.  \n\nIt creeped me out.  I\u2019ll admit it.  Her posture was entirely different.  It was as though it wasn\u2019t even her at all.\n\nThen she spoke.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t her voice that I heard.  It was much lower and gravelly.  Like something out of a horror movie.\n\n\u201c*I\u2019ll chew the skin from your bones.*\u201d  She said.\n\nI froze. \n\nAt first, I just kept looking at her.  This was not at all what I expected.  I thought it would be more like the way Tourette\u2019s is often portrayed.  Just random swearing and shouting.   I honestly thought to myself\u2026 what will I do if she attacks me right now?  What if she really does try to chew the skin from my bones?  \n\nBut then she just lied down and went back to sleep.\n\nI was creeped out.  I tried to lie back down and ignore her but struggled.  I couldn\u2019t even close my eyes without thinking \u201cMaybe she\u2019s sitting up again and staring at me.\u201d  And then one time I rolled over to look at her\u2026and she *was*.\n\nHer face was pressed right towards mine.  Her breath was foul and rotted.  Something that was most certainly not normal for her.  She spoke again, in the same voice as before.\n\n\u201c*If you don\u2019t move to the couch, you\u2019ll be dead by morning.*\u201d\n\nThat did it for me.  I sat up in a moment and headed for the living room.\n\nShe made some sort of wheezing sound as I left.  I think it was supposed to be laughter.\n\nI was lying on the couch, but I wasn\u2019t going to be able to fall back to sleep.  I was far too shaken.\n\nI was staring out towards the window, hoping to see the first few hints of the sun rising.\n\nAnd then I thought I heard something.  From the bedroom.\n\nI listened.\n\nAnd then I heard it again. \n\n\u201c*Stephen.*\u201d   It was that same low and gravelly voice. It sounded like a witch. \n\nI tried to just ignore it at first.  But then it continued. \n\n\u201c*Stephen.*\u201d  \n\nStill I said nothing.  \n\n\u201c*I know you can hear me, Stephen.  You\u2019re awake now.  Why don\u2019t you come back into the bedroom?*\u201d\n\nThe voice barely sounded human.  \n\n\u201c*Or maybe you\u2019d prefer if I come to **you**?*\u201d\n\nI still didn\u2019t say anything.  I was told not to.  But I listened.  If I heard her start walking towards the bedroom door, I\u2019m not even joking, I would have run right out of the apartment. But she had asked me not to respond to her sleep talking.  So I didn\u2019t.\n\nAnd then I heard her once more.\n\n\u201c*Sorry if this spoils your plans.*\u201d   She began laughing.  \u201c*The two of you were supposed to walk that trail again.*\u201d she started.  I wasn\u2019t even remotely prepared for what she\u2019d say next.\n\n \u201c*You\u2019d both be so tired when you\u2019d reach the top.  You\u2019d look over the city.  Then you\u2019ll get on one knee, and bring out the ring.*\u201d  She began laughing. \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I realized this wasn\u2019t just a problem with sleep talking.  It was something much more.  Something supernatural.  I had never told anybody about my proposal fantasy.  There was simply no way she could have known about any of it.\n\nThis was no longer about merely talking in ones\u2019 sleep.  This was about possession. I can\u2019t go back into the bedroom.  I have no idea what would happen if I did.  Instead, I\u2019m going to wait it out, holding up in my living room until the sun rises.  I have a couple more hours yet.  I can hear her laughing occasionally in the bedroom. It\u2019s still not her voice. Still that same low pitch cackle.\n\nBut as I sit on my couch writing this out, here\u2019s what scares me the most\u2026\n\nMaybe my infatuation and utter obsession with her wasn\u2019t normal.  I said before that I felt like I was losing control of myself.  More so I believe than the typical falling in love story.  No.  I fear that the infatuation I felt was the entity slowly taking control of *me*.  Of it controlling my thoughts, fears, ambitions, and anxieties.  Maybe once I become completely absorbed, a transfer would occur, and she would be free of it. \n\nI know I should leave.  That I should open the front door, get in my car, and drive away from here.  But I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t leave her.  I\u2019ve already lost control.\n\nI\u2019m infatuated with her.\n\nUtterly infatuated."},"224":{"title":"***EMERGENCY ALERT***","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/5wduaf\/emergency_alert\/","flair":"Series","author":"TheCrystalGem","selftext":"***EMERGENCY ALERT***\n-THIS IS NOT A TEST\n-IMMEDIATE THREAT FOR RESIDENTS OF [withheld] COUNTIES\n-BE WARY OF:\n  -SEVERE WINDS\n  -LIGHTNING\n  -SEVERE RAIN\n  -FLASH FLOODS\n-RESIDENTS ARE ADVISED TO STAY INDOORS\n  -PLEASE LOCK OR BAR ALL ENTRYWAYS INTO YOUR HOUSE\n-RESTRAIN FROM USING ANY DEVICES THAT EMIT LIGHT OR LOUD NOISE\n-PLEASE ENTER A ROOM WITH NO WINDOWS\n-EFFECTIVE INDEFINITELY\n-ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE\n\nThis was the message I was greeted by in the middle of an episode of Big Bang Theory in my living room. Frozen halfway through a forkful of Kraft Mac N' Cheese, I sat bolt upright and turned around to look out the window. The sky, as I thought, was crystal clear. A few clouds, but nothing crazy. No rain. No thunder. Nothing. Confused, I turned off the TV, erasing the alert from the screen. My two dogs came walking over to me and I patted them on their heads. One of my dogs, the other's brother, was shaking profusely from the buzzing noise that always shows up with Amber Alerts and the like. I left them in the living room and walked through my kitchen and onto my front porch. My neighbors, too, were standing outside their houses, all looking at the sky in bemusement.\n\nAn immediate threat? It didn't seem like it, I thought as my phone started buzzing with the same tone. One by one, everyone else's phones started ringing.\n\nI should explain, I guess, that I have never experienced a severe weather warning for real. Not once in my life. I suppose it should come as no surprise, seeing as I live in Oregon of all places. I supposed maybe it was just a mistake, but just as the thought floated across my mind, I heard the  siren.\n\nThe siren of the squad car coming down the street. An officer talked through the speaker. \"This is not a drill. Please enter your homes immediately. Do not go outside under any circumstances.\"\n\nNever the kind of guy to ignore higher authorities, I entered my house nervously, turned off all the lights on the above-ground floors, and took my dogs into my basement with a sleeping bag, some food, my phone, a charger, some spare batteries, flashlight, and other essentials. I called my brother, who lives a couple of blocks away, and asked him if he had gotten the message. He had. I considered saying we should stay together to wait out the storm, but then I figured we'd probably get in trouble for that. So I hung up, got comfortable on my sleeping bag, and started browsing Reddit. Eventually, I fell asleep, seeing as I was under stress and had woken up pretty early. When I woke up, I realized that I still didn't hear any rain. Seriously, nothing at all. More confused than ever, I decided to see if the alert had been called off. I turned on my phone and called my brother again. It went straight to voicemail, though, so I gave up. I decided to risk it and go upstairs. I had to squeeze between the door and the wall to keep my dogs from following me upstairs, but I won and they stayed in the basement. I walked through my kitchen to the front door and looked out the window part of it. As I squinted to see outside in the dark (strange, seeing as it was only 2:00 PM judging by my clock), the TV flickered briefly. I looked around at it and it flickered again, but this time every device on the ground floor flickered. Thinking little of it, I turned around and looked through the door again. Every house on the block had its lights turned off. Nobody was outside.\n\nExcept for one teenage girl.\n\nA thin, short-haired girl wearing what looked like a pillowcase walked unsteadily down the street, very slowly, looking as though she was having some difficulty. I turned around, now extremely confused and worried, and got the dogs' food bowls, which I had forgotten earlier. When I looked up, one of the houses, the one diagonally across from mine (right next to the house across the street and to the left) had it's lights on and one of its windows broken. I shuddered and rushed back into the basement as the lights flickered intensely.\n\nI locked the door to the basement and sat on an old, tattered couch that I had brought down here--the basement is where I put everything I didn't have room for. So, yeah, it's packed. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention something that may be worth noting: I live in a small town. A very small town, probably with a population of under 500. Or less. As a matter of fact, it isn't even on most maps. We never make any news, we never have any scandals or anything. This is the first interesting thing that's happened, I think, since Mrs. [withheld] lost her dentures to a raccoon. So, it's possible this whole thing seems way worse than it is.\n\nCall me crazy, but until a few minutes ago, I was thoroughly enjoying myself. I love these scenarios, and my basement is totally secure, so I'm having the time of my life. Well, I was. I decided to turn on my radio--what harm could it do, as long as I didn't turn the volume up to high?\n\nI was surprised to find that our local radio station was still up and running. They were talking about the weather, so I listened hard for any news that I hadn't heard. There wasn't any--they were just as confused as us. Not wanting to listen to crappy pop music indefinitely, I tuned into another station. This one was one I hadn't heard before.\n\n-\"Could you give me the status of [withheld] county? Over.\"\n-\"No new developments. Over.\"\n-\"Okay. Any fatalities? Over.\"\n-\"What part of \"no new developments\" do you not understand, McClellan? A squad car will be passing through soon to scan the area for the target. Over.\"\n-\"Any ETA on that? Over.\"\n-\"No, not yet. Over.\"\n-\"And any word from HQ, Jones? Over.\"\n-\"No, McClellan. Not yet. Not since 013 first got out. Over.\"\n-\"Well, let me know if and when they contact you. Over.\"\n\nAt that point, I lost the signal. Well, not really, but the connection got so weak that I could barely make out anything they were saying. I figured I must have found a police communication channel. And I had been left with no answers whatsoever.\n\nThat was about forty-five minutes ago, as of me writing this now. Guys, I don't know what's going on. Do any of you live near me? You'll know if you've received the warning. I'd say what county I live in, and which ones were affected, but I don't know to for privacy reasons. Anyway, I'll keep you guys updated, okay? Until then, wish me luck.\n\nEDIT: Woah, guys, this has blown up. I'll be sure to keep you posted over the next few days!\n\nUPDATE: Just a quick update before the first major update--about five minutes ago, a car alarm went off somewhere to the right of my house. I'm too freaked out to go check it out, but I'll go up and see how it looks tomorrow morning, and I'll update you then.\n\nNEXT UPDATE COMING TODAY"},"225":{"title":"I work security at Disney World... well, I mean I did.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/8oueb7\/i_work_security_at_disney_world_well_i_mean_i_did\/","flair":null,"author":"disneysecurity","selftext":"I work in security at Disney World, the happiest place on Earth. Typically, I wouldn\u2019t say where I work as obviously there are some pretty strict rules about things employees can put online, but I just don\u2019t think I can tell this properly without that context. And, honestly, I think this may be it for me anyway with this job. I just can\u2019t see myself working here any longer now. \n\nI\u2019ve been with the company for 23 years. The first 20 years I worked in the parks \u2013 nabbing shoplifters and rounding up people who were drinking too much for the heat. Occasionally there\u2019d be a fight to break up, but people usually kept it pretty mild. \n\nThe heat and walking was getting too much for me the last few years so I asked to be transferred somewhere with a\/c and the company moved me to one of their resorts. While the working conditions were 110&#37; better as far as climate and comfort go, the guest issues were trickier \\- mainly domestics. I guess the expensive and stress of vacation got to a lot of people and I\u2019d be called by neighboring rooms because some mom and dad were yelling at each other. I\u2019d try to suggest they take a nap or go do separate activities for a bit and that would usually calm them down.\n\nBut none of that is what I\u2019m here for. I\u2019ve got to get this out while I have time.\n\nThree days ago I got a call from management. Apparently a couple of days before that, housekeeping had went into a room that should\u2019ve been turned over that day (turned over is when one guest leaves by about 11:00 a.m. and the next guest checks in around 3:00 p.m.) and all of the guests\u2019 items were still in the room. Housekeeping made a note of it and moved on, but during the next two days when they entered the room, everything was still there and untouched.\n\nI went to check it out and sure enough there was an empty room full of luggage, clothes, snacks, some toys, everything a family would need for vacation. The manager had already looked up the previous reservation and it was for a family \u2013 dad, mom, two little kids. I tried to call the phone numbers they had given but all I got was voice mail. We were a bit stumped so I made the call that housekeeper could clean the room and take the family\u2019s personal items to be held until we got in contact with someone.\n\nI went digging into the reservation more. The family had arrived five days before housekeeping discovered all of their stuff.  I found that the family had paid a parking fee and their vehicle description was listed. A quick walk of the parking lots and I had easily located their vehicle. So that ruled out a car accident or them deciding to just leave all their stuff behind. \n\nNext, I saw that they had bought a dining plan. This is when a guest prepays for all of their food. They\u2019re given a certain number of \u201ccredits\u201d to use for meals. This family had only used 3 credits and the last one was two days after they checked in. It appeared that the day they arrived, they got here late and probably just stayed on the resort. The next day they used 2 credits at Epcot. The second park day they used just 1 credit at Magic Kingdom and it was at breakfast time. \n\nNow at Disney we have something called Magic Bands. Magic Bands are worn by the guests and act as a room key, park ticket, credit card, dining reservation payment, fastpass (a system used to bypass lines), and more. It took some work, but I was finally able to look up this family\u2019s fastpass history. The day they went to Magic Kingdom, they had breakfast at a restaurant in the park, rode a couple of rides, and then rode their last ride, It\u2019s a Small World around 11:00 a.m. Then nothing.\n\nFinally, it was time to bring in someone else on this. I called an old co\\-worker at Magic Kingdom and asked him to pull security footage for It\u2019s a Small World at the time they rode it and I made my way over there. When I got there, my friend was very confused, almost distraught, looking. He showed me what he found. There\u2019s usually a camera in the direction of where rides load and unload. The footage showed them scanning their bands to use fastpasses for the ride and boarding the ride. The footage from the exit of the ride just showed the other people in their car exiting. They weren\u2019t there.\n\nOf course we thought the worse, maybe one of the kids had fallen out and mom and dad and the other kid got off in the middle of the ride to help and they all got injured or killed or stuck in machinery somewhere. So we shut down the ride. Middle of the damn day. Turned off that ear worm music and turned up the lights. Me and my buddy walked that ride three times before we called in help. Eventually there was close to ten cast members searching, and we didn\u2019t find shit except for three cell phones and a hat.\n\nI was right stumped. I've kept digging the past couple of days, and I\u2019m not sure who to tell what I found next to. I\u2019ve called the police and I suppose they\u2019re on the way, but the company has a way of covering up things like this and I decided I can\u2019t live with myself if I don\u2019t put out some type of warning.\n\nI kept digging into their reservation over the last couple of days and today I noticed they had purchased memory maker. There are photographers all over the parks and cameras in a lot of the rides and, with memory maker, the photos are all free. They automatically get added to a guest\u2019s Disney account when the system knows their picture has been taken. And the system always knows. Everyone\u2019s whereabouts are always known with the Magic Bands.\n\nWell, I opened up their memory maker photo album and, I swear, there\u2019s 732 pictures. The first 30 or so are pretty normal. Epcot, a few rides, in front of the castle. But the rest. The rest are all in It\u2019s a Small World. The rides only take one picture per go around. So it appears as though this family has ridden this ride over 700 times. The first picture was pretty normal. Everyone looked happy, it was busy day and a full car of guests.  The next one is rough to look at. The car is empty except for this little family and they look so darn confused. The next 10\\-15 I can see dad getting angry, yelling. Mom is holding onto those two kids like her life depends on it and you can see the kids getting increasingly upset, crying. And it goes on, and on, and on. After 50 or so it looks like they\u2019re trying to get out. In one the dad is missing. In another they\u2019re all gone.  Maybe like they\u2019ve bailed early in the ride and tried to walk out, but in the very next one, they\u2019re all right back in that damn car. After around 450 or so, I only see the mom and kids. It\u2019s just when I look closely I can see dad, maybe just his body now, slumped down in one of the other seats. Since about 675, there\u2019s just mom and one kid. Another body in another seat.  The mom and kid aren\u2019t moving anymore. I think them two are still alive, just damn near catatonic. Looking straight ahead, pale.  \n\nAnd, y\u2019all, I swear on my fucking life, the dolls are moving or something. In some of these pictures I can tell they aren\u2019t where they should be. I even saw one with a doll in the car with this family.\n\nI can\u2019t look anymore or I\u2019m going to lose my lunch. I closed the album. It\u2019s file sized has increased since I closed it. God, are there new pictures being added? \n\nI see on security cameras that the local PD just arrived so they\u2019ll take over soon. I wish I knew what the fuck is going on, but I also wish this damn thing had never landed in my lap. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to update this. After I talk to the police, I think I\u2019m going to walk out of here and never come back. I just wanted to get this out there, before Disney feeds the media some bullshit cover up as to why a whole family vanished. They didn\u2019t vanish. I know where they are."},"226":{"title":"My husband insists on keeping this one painting of a woman","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/twijls\/my_husband_insists_on_keeping_this_one_painting\/","flair":null,"author":"RobertMort","selftext":"When my husband and I first got married and moved in together, we had a few fights. On personal space, on chores\u2026 and on d\u00e9cor.\n\nNamely, my husband insisted on keeping this weird painting of a woman.\n\n\u201cWho is she?\u201d I\u2019d asked when I first saw it, leaned against a mountain of moving boxes.\n\n\u201cDunno. Got it at a rummage sale.\u201d\n\nIt was an original painting. Oil, I think, judging by the way the light reflected off the brushstrokes. It depicted a young woman standing in a dark room, looking over her shoulder at the viewer. She was actually rather beautiful. Blonde hair falling over her shoulders like a waterfall. A white cotton dress. A dainty, heart-shaped face that was somehow haunting rather than cute.\n\nShe was illuminated brightly, but the room behind her was dark. The contrast and her pose reminded me a little bit of *Girl With A Pearl Earring*. But it didn\u2019t feel classy, or pensive, or beautiful. Instead it felt\u2026 creepy.\n\nEspecially because my husband insisted on hanging it above our bed.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s a beautiful painting,\u201d I said. \u201cBut it just doesn\u2019t fit with the modern d\u00e9cor.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither do your Funko Pops.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, but they\u2019re small. This painting is *enormous.* For Pete\u2019s sake, the woman is nearly life-sized!\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to keep her where she is.\u201d\n\nIt seemed like a big deal to him, so I dropped it. But it wasn\u2019t easy. Sometimes I woke up in the middle of the night with the horrible feeling that I was being watched. Then I\u2019d look up and see her haunting gray eyes staring down at me.\n\nI didn\u2019t get much sleep after that.\n\nAnd there was the one time I swear she moved. \u201cWas her hand always like that?\u201d I asked Eric, after getting into bed one night.\n\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\n\n\u201cHer left hand. The fingers are kind of open, reaching out behind her. Like she\u2019s waiting for someone to grab her hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, she was always like that.\u201d\n\nI could\u2019ve sworn she *wasn\u2019t* always like that. Then again, I generally avoided looking at the painting. It was so uncomfortably realistic. When I stared into those gray eyes, I almost felt like I was making eye contact with a person.\n\nI lasted two weeks. Then I begged Eric to move it.\n\n\u201cCan we *please* move the painting somewhere else? I really hate looking at it when I\u2019m going to sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the nicest piece of art we have. It belongs above the bed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about the sunflower one?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just a print,\u201d he complained. \u201cAnd it\u2019s so basic.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on. I\u2019ll move my Funko Pops out if you move the painting out.\u201d\n\nHe heaved a long sigh. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll move her.\u201d\n\nThat was another thing. He often referred to the painting as \u201cher.\u201d It was weird.\n\nSo he moved it to the stairs. But honestly, that was worse. Every time I went downstairs, there she was. Staring at me from above the landing with those piercing gray eyes. At least when the painting was in the bedroom, I was usually asleep or facing the opposite direction.\n\nI hit my breaking point a few days after that.\n\nFor some reason I couldn\u2019t sleep. After tossing and turning for an hour, I decided to grab a snack downstairs. I got to the top of the stairs\u2026 and there she was.\n\nI hadn\u2019t turned on the main lights\u2014only the nightlight in the hall bathroom was on. With everything so dark, the background of the painting melted into the shadows. But the woman still stood out, with her pale face and white dress.\n\nAnd my stupid, sleepy brain interpreted it as an actual person standing there.\n\nI jumped about a foot in the air. And I would\u2019ve fallen all the way down the stairs, had I not caught the banister at the last second.\n\n\u201cCan we pleeeease get rid of that painting?\u201d I asked the next morning.\n\nEric turned away from the stove, set the spatula down. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cLast night, it scared the frick out of me. I nearly fell down the stairs.\u201d\n\nHe stared at me, as if unable to understand. \u201cShe\u2026 scared you?\u201d he asked slowly.\n\n\u201cWell, more like startled me. I thought it was actually a person standing there.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me.\n\nThen he broke into laughter. And, after a few seconds, I started laughing too. It *was* pretty stupid, now that I thought about it. I know I was sleepy, but still\u2014I thought the painting was a *person?!* What, did I think we were being burglarized by a young, beautiful, blonde woman in a nightdress?\n\n\u201cFor now, I\u2019ll move her into my office. Then you don\u2019t have to look at her at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds good.\u201d\n\nAnd for a while after that, things were okay. I sort of noticed Eric spending more time in his office than usual, but he also had a big deadline for a brief coming up. And what, how would that be related to the painting, anyway? It\u2019s not like he was staring at her for hours on end.\n\nExcept that\u2019s exactly what I caught him doing.\n\nOne night he didn\u2019t come downstairs to eat dinner with me. I called up to him a few times. No reply. So I went upstairs and walked into his office\u2014to find him staring at her.\n\nHe was just sitting there. With his computer closed. No papers on the desk. Swivel chair turned towards the woman in the painting.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said suddenly, when I walked in. Then he quickly stood up. \u201cI was just about to come down. Just sent in the brief a few minutes ago. They\u2019re really happy with it.\u201d\n\nHe smiled broadly at me, as if nothing were wrong, and then slipped past me. I listened to his footsteps thump down the stairs.\n\n*Had he actually just finished working?*\n\n*Or was he just sitting in here\u2026 staring at her?*\n\nI ultimately decided not to bring it up. The painting was out of my sight and that was great. Besides, I had bigger fish to fry, like my own deadline coming up for an article I hadn\u2019t even started.\n\nBut then, on Friday afternoon, I accidentally overheard him on the phone. His voice was muffled through the thick wooden door, but it wasn\u2019t hard to hear him. He was shouting, almost.\n\n*\u201cI\u2019ll have it in by tonight\u2014\u201d*\n\n*\u201cNo, I knew it was due on Wednesday\u2014\u201d*\n\n*\u201cWell, my wife fell down the stairs. I had to take her to the hospital.\u201d*\n\nThose words sent a chill through me. I barged in.\n\n\u201cWhy are you lying about me falling down the stairs?\u201d\n\nHis face paled. He ended the call and turned towards me. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Tara. But I needed an excuse. I missed the deadline on that brief, and it\u2019s my job on the line\u2014\"\n\n\u201cThe brief you told me you finished two days ago?\u201d\n\nHe nodded, silently.\n\nI crossed my arms. \u201cLook, Eric, your work is your business. But we\u2019ve spent, like, all of one hour together all week. Because you\u2019ve been locked in here all day, every day. I mean, are you even working? Or are you just sitting in here, staring at *her?*\u201d\n\nHis dark eyes locked on mine. And then his voice grew soft. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re jealous of her.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 *What?!\u201d*\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be, Tara,\u201d he said, stepping towards me. \u201cThe painting makes her prettier than she was.\u201d\n\nI froze. Stared at him.\n\nThen I finally found the words. \u201cAre you saying\u2026 this is a painting of someone you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cSorry, I misspoke. I meant, whoever this is a portrait of, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a flattering likeness. All portraits are flattering like that.\u201d\n\nI stared at him, my heart pounding in my chest.\n\n\u201cWho is this a painting of, Eric?\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you, it\u2019s not\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cEric.\u201d I stepped towards him. My legs felt weak, wobbling underneath me. \u201c*Who is this a painting of?!\u201d*\n\nHe only shook his head.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI couldn\u2019t sleep that night.\n\nI know, it sounds silly, being so worked up over a painting. But you have to admit it was weird. He was obsessed with this thing, for whatever reason. *Why didn\u2019t I see the painting when we were dating? Did he hide it away in the basement?* That was the one place I\u2019d never been. Had he built a little shrine down there, painting, candles, the whole nine yards?\n\nThe thought of it made me sick.\n\n*Is it an ex-girlfriend? An ex-wife, even, that he never told me about?* Getting a painting commissioned must have cost a fortune. Especially a huge, detailed one like this. I mean, as much as I hated that thing, it was clearly done by someone incredibly gifted. The glint in those piercing gray eyes, the small dimple on her right cheek\u2026\n\nBut clearly he wasn\u2019t keeping it to appreciate the artistry.\n\n*He knew her.*\n\n*And whoever she is, he\u2019s obsessed with her.*\n\nAnd then I got the craziest idea.\n\nI sat up in bed. Slowly, quietly. Turned to Eric. He was fast asleep. Then I slipped out from underneath the covers, grabbed my phone from the nightstand\u2014and tiptoed out of the room.\n\nMy bare feet padded softly across the hallway as I made my way towards his office. Then I pushed the heavy wooden door open and stepped inside.\n\nThe office was cold\u2014much colder than our bedroom. Goosebumps pricked up my bare arms. But I didn\u2019t waste any time. I reached over, fumbling across the wall, and hit the switch.\n\nThe light flicked on.\n\nThe blonde woman stared down at me from the wall. Her eyes seemed to follow me as I took Eric\u2019s leather chair and dragged it across the hardwood. Once against the wall, I stepped up onto it.\n\nWe were staring at each other, face to face.\n\nI\u2019d never been this close to the painting before. My face inches from hers. This close, I could truly appreciate the detail. Each individual eyelash painstakingly drawn, curving up from its follicle. Threadlike striations of light and dark gray filling her irises. Her skin, so pale and creamy, dotted with the tiniest of pores.\n\nBut I wasn\u2019t here to appreciate the artwork.\n\nI lifted my phone\u2014and took a photo.\n\nThen I brought up a reverse image search.\n\nIt took a few minutes for me to find the right website and upload the photo. But when the results loaded\u2026 I gasped.\n\nI expected maybe one result, if I were lucky. Some sort of facial recognition that would match the painted face to a photo. Or, maybe the artist\u2019s website would come up, and mention who the subject was. But instead\u2014*dozens* of thumbnails filled the page. Of the exact same painting I\u2019d been staring at for weeks.\n\nFingers trembling, I clicked on the first one. It led to a news article.\n\n**Search Continues for Missing Franklin Art Student**\n\nMy heart dropped. Little black dots danced in my vision. I collapsed into the chair behind me, trembling, and began to read.\n\n*Anya Kelsing, 23, went missing after a hike with her boyfriend\u2026*\n\n*The two became separated when they came upon a bear\u2026*\n\n*Her backpack was found roughly a mile from where the sighting occurred, but no trace of Anya was found\u2026*\n\nAnd the caption under the painting.\n\n*Kelsing is a third-year student at Franklin College, majoring in Fine Arts. She recently completed a self-portrait that was exhibited at Le Coeur (above)*\n\nI clicked on the next article, and the next\u2014but they all said the same thing. Hike, bear, disappearance. All of them showed a photo along with her self-portrait; she looked strikingly identical to her painted likeness. None of them mentioned the boyfriend\u2019s name, but it had to be Eric. The most recent article, from five years ago, was a video clip of her parents begging for her search to continue. Sadly, judging by the news articles, it never did.\n\nI don\u2019t know how long I sat there. All I know is that I was suddenly jolted from my thoughts by a loud *thump* in the hallway.\n\nFootsteps. Coming towards the office.\n\nI shot up. *He can\u2019t find me here.* I glanced around the room, looking for someplace\u2014any place\u2014that I could hide. But it was probably too late. Surely he\u2019d seen the light on, from under the door\u2026\n\nI ducked under the desk just as he stepped into the room.\n\n\u201cTara?\u201d\n\nI clapped my hand over my mouth, trying to silence my ragged breathing. *He\u2019s going to see the chair out of place. He knows I\u2019m here. He knows\u2026*\n\n\u201cTara, you in here?\u201d\n\n*Why did I hide? I could\u2019ve just said I came in here because I heard a noise. Needed a pen. Couldn\u2019t sleep. Why the fuck did I hide? Now he\u2019s going to know that I know\u2026*\n\n\u201cTara?\u201d\n\n*But maybe it\u2019s fine. Maybe the bear got Anya, maybe Eric had nothing to do with it. Isn\u2019t that more likely than Eric being a murderer?*\n\n\u201cThere you are.\u201d\n\nI looked up\u2014and screamed.\n\nEric was crouched there, in front of the desk, staring at me.\n\n\u201cI\u2014I was looking for a pen,\u201d I stuttered, lamely. \u201cI wanted to write down\u2014I remembered I have to pick up groceries tomorrow and I needed to add something\u2026\u201d\n\nHe tilted his head, a small smile on his lips. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the truth, Tara.\u201d\n\n*Make a break for it.*\n\nI started to lunge out from under the desk. His hand quickly shot out and grabbed my wrist. *Hard.* \u201cYou figured out who she is, didn\u2019t you? That\u2019s the only reason you\u2019d be hiding from me.\u201d\n\nI trembled in his grasp. \u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d I whispered.\n\nHe let out a dry laugh. \u201cSo you think I\u2019m a murderer. How nice, that\u2019s the first conclusion you jump to.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014no, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a murderer.\u201d I swallowed. *Stupid, stupid, stupid. If he killed her, and he knows you know\u2026 then you\u2019re dead too.* \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that. Just\u2026 what happened? They didn\u2019t find a body. Did the bear get her?\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t reply. Just stared at me, silently, with those cold dark eyes.\n\n\u201cI was jealous,\u201d I continued, desperately, \u201cbut now I understand. I wish you\u2019d just told me. To lose someone like that\u2026 of course you\u2019d want to keep the painting. It\u2019s all you have left of her.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should have just left it alone,\u201d he said, his tone oddly emotionless. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to find out this way.\u201d\n\nI screamed as he lunged for me.\n\n*It\u2019s over.* His hands were clenched tight on my wrists as he dragged me out from under the desk. I pulled back, trying to wrench myself free, but it was no use\u2014\n\n*Thump!*\n\nA loud crash sounded behind us. Eric whipped around, and for a split second\u2014his grip released.\n\nI acted instantly. Pulled free from him and ran, pivoting around the desk and racing towards the door. As I glanced back, I saw Eric, starting after me.\n\nBut I also saw what had made the noise.\n\nThe painting of Anya had fallen from the wall. It lay askew on the floor, her gray eyes staring emptily upwards.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI was always a fast runner.\n\nEric was only halfway down the stairs by the time I was at the bottom. Bursting out into the cold air, I began to scream. He grabbed me from behind and tried to pull me back inside, but it was too late. Lights were flicking on. Our neighbor rushed out of his house, dialing 911.\n\nIt was over.\n\nThe police arrested Eric for assault. And once I told them my story, of his obsession with Anya\u2019s painting, they were able to search our house. And hidden in his office drawer, in a small box, was a pair of gold earrings.\n\nThe same earrings Anya wore on the hike that day.\n\nThe case is slowly mounting against him. I\u2019m hoping, praying Anya gets justice and that a jury convicts him of her horrible murder.\n\nAnd would he have done the same to me, if I hadn\u2019t escaped? If Anya\u2019s painting hadn\u2019t fallen off the wall?\n\nThere was an explanation, of course. When Eric had moved the painting to his office, he\u2019d mistakenly installed one of the hangers into pure drywall. The weight of the painting had caused it to rip out, and the painting fell.\n\nBut sometimes, I think Anya was watching over me. That her self-portrait carried a piece of her. And that night, she\u2019d protected me from falling victim to the monster who ended her life.\n\nThe painting now hangs up in my foyer. Every day I walk by it, and new details pop out at me: the deep, shadowy green of the room behind her. A perfectly-painted strand of blonde hair. The glint in her piercing gray eyes.\n\nAnd sometimes, I think she\u2019s smiling back at me."},"227":{"title":"My wife has a removable face.

We were watching a movie on her couch when I made my move to kiss her. She whipped her hand in front of my face and blocked me.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something you need to know,\u201d she said.\n\nI braced myself. *Here it comes. \u201cI\u2019m not ready for a relationship. Nothing to do with you, of course.\u201d* It was the absolute last thing that I wanted to hear, because I was already crazy about her.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cI have a removable face.\u201d\n\n*That\u2019s a new one.* \u201cYou have a what now?\u201d I was about to laugh, but she was wearing a deadly serious expression.\n\n\u201cI have a removable face.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that, like, a metaphor or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. My face is literally removable. Look. Closely.\u201d She lifted her chin and traced her jaw line with a finger. \u201cYou can see the seam.\u201d\n\nAfter admiring how beautiful her neck was for a dizzying moment, I leaned in for an inspection. It was very hard to see, but it *did* look like there was a slightly unnatural transition there from her face to her throat. I grew dizzier, as a dozen questions rushed into my brain.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t bother asking why or how or anything like that,\u201d said Samantha. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you that. If that\u2019s going to be a problem, you should leave now. I\u2019m letting you know this because I like you, and I want to take the next step, but this is non-negotiable.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, unsure of what was happening. \u201cNot a problem. So what? You have a removable face. Who cares? It looks good.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something else. Once a day, usually in the evening, I have to remove the face and disinfect the inside of it. If I don\u2019t, it will rot. This takes about an hour, give or take, depending on how my day went. During this time, you must never *ever* look at my real face. *Never*. Do you understand?\u201d\n\n\u201cY\u2026 yes. Got it. Don\u2019t ask about it, don\u2019t look at your\u2026 \u2018real\u2019 face.\u201d\n\nSamantha stood up. \u201cNow, I\u2019m going to go into the bathroom and clean my face. That will give you plenty of time to think about what I\u2019ve told you. If you\u2019re here when I\u2019m done\u2026 that\u2019s great. I would like that. But if you\u2019re gone\u2026 I\u2019ll understand.\u201d\n\nShe turned and walked into her bedroom. I sat in stunned silence as I heard the bathroom door close.\n\nI gave the thing some serious thought. It was possible that it was a joke of some kind. It was possible that it was a delusion. Was it possible that it was true? Well, it was certainly possible to transform an actor\u2019s face with movie makeup, so I supposed it was possible that Samantha wore a \u201cremovable face\u201d every day. Maybe she had had a horrible accident where her flesh had been mangled. Maybe her face had been melted by acid, or burned by fire, or the skin shorn off by heavy machinery. If it had, I would never know, because she would never tell me, and I would never see it.\n\nI pictured a face of raw, naked muscle, rotting away. Could I kiss her, if that was what I was kissing? But wasn\u2019t that what we all were, under the skin? Just muscle and bone and blood and squishy organs.\n\nI paced around the living room, running my hand through my hair. I liked Samantha, a lot. She was smart, and funny\u2026 and beautiful. But was that beauty *real*? Did it count? Did it matter if it was \u201creal\u201d or not? Was I being superficial even worrying about it?\n\nWhen she came out of the bathroom, I was still there. I looked at her face. She smiled and I was in love.\n\n\\*\n\nWe dated, we moved in together, we decided to get married.\n\nFor the most part, it was a completely normal relationship, typical of two young people in love, building a life together. During the day, it was easy to forget about the face altogether. It looked natural enough, and only in certain positions, in certain lights, was there ever any indication that it *wasn\u2019t* natural.\n\nBut every night was the same. Samantha would close herself in the bathroom \u2013 sometimes for an hour, sometimes for two \u2013 and clean the inside of her face. The curiosity never left me. I would sit there and wonder what was under that face. I came so close to barging in on her a few times, but I never did.\n\nI *did* occasionally ask her about it. About what, if anything, had happened. About how it was possible to make the removable face look so real. About what it really looked like underneath. I tried to coax her into showing me, assuring her that I loved her no matter what, and didn\u2019t give a damn what her real face looked like\u2026 I was just curious, that\u2019s all.\n\nShe never showed me, or told me the story behind it. She didn\u2019t get upset at me (unless I was really badgering her.) She\u2019d just shrug and say, \u201cYou know you can\u2019t see it. You know I can\u2019t tell you about it.\u201d\n\n\\*\n\nI never told anybody about Samantha\u2019s removable face. It\u2019s not that she asked me not to. I just didn\u2019t think it was anybody\u2019s business.\n\nExcept once, I did tell somebody.\n\nIt was during my bachelor\u2019s party. We had rented several cabins in Big Sur and spent the night drinking and packing our noses with powders that we shouldn\u2019t have been packing our noses with. Everyone else had passed out and the sun was creeping up behind us as I stood on the majestic cliffs with my friend Chris, looking down on the pacific waves crashing against the rocks.\n\nChris was my best friend; as close to a brother as I\u2019d known. We\u2019d grown up together, and visited each other at college often, and spent the summers together. After college, we\u2019d moved to different cities, but we stayed in close contact.\n\nStanding there on the cliffs, I told Chris about Samantha\u2019s removable face. At first, he thought I was joking. Then he had a thousand questions, most of which I couldn\u2019t answer.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s underneath?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, man. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t that drive you crazy, not knowing?\u201d\n\nI shrugged. \u201cLots of stuff I don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t know how to do calculus, and I don\u2019t know what happens when we die.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut dude, she\u2019s about to be your *wife*. And you don\u2019t even know what she *looks like*. I mean, I\u2019d have to take a look. Like, you could set a camera up in the bathroom. That\u2019s where she does it, right? Set up a camera and have a look and then you\u2019ll know.\u201d\n\nI sighed. \u201cYeah, it drives me crazy. I\u2019ve asked her a million times. But she told me I could never look. Gotta respect that, man, even if I don\u2019t like it. That\u2019s love.\u201d\n\nChris laughed. \u201c*You* telling *me* to respect a woman? Up is down now.\u201d\n\nThen we fell back into talking about old times as a new day dawned.\n\n\\*\n\nChris was in town for business last week, and planned on spending the weekend at our house. The conversation at Big Sur had happened four years ago, and we hadn\u2019t spoken about Samantha\u2019s removable face since, despite keeping in close contact and seeing each other as often as two people transforming into adults in different parts of the country can.\n\nIt happened on Saturday evening. We were lounging lazily in the backyard, deep into the beer, having just finished with some grilled steaks, when I got a text from work.\n\n\u201cGoddammit,\u201d I groaned. \u201cI have to make a work call.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d said Samantha, raising an artificial eyebrow. \u201cOn a Saturday night?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy biggest client, baby. Sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is what it is, I guess,\u201d said my wife. \u201cI\u2019m going to head inside and get cleaned up. Chris? Are you okay just hanging out for a bit?\u201d\n\nChris smiled. \u201cI'll be fine. Got my beer, got some weeds to pull in your garden. God knows your lazy-ass husband isn\u2019t going to do it. Those tomatoes are choking to death. It\u2019s a tragedy.\u201d\n\nI rolled my eyes and went into the side yard to make my call.\n\n15 minutes into it, I heard the screams coming from inside. Both my best friend and my wife were wailing in terror.\n\nI dropped the phone and ran into the house and down the hall to our bedroom. Through the open door, I could see that the door to the master bathroom was also standing open.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t come in!\u201d screamed Samantha. \u201cI don\u2019t have my face on! Call an ambulance! He looked! Oh God, he looked!\u201d She sounded desperate, and truly horrified. That made me desperate and horrified, and I wanted to rush into the bathroom, but I knew suddenly that that would be a mistake.\n\nI knew suddenly that Samantha didn\u2019t want me to look at her real face not out of a sense of vanity, but for my own safety.\n\nChris staggered backwards, out of the bathroom. He was holding a straightened out paperclip, which he had used to pick the privacy lock. Now he was stabbing it again and again into his eyes, shouting gibberish. He was clearly in the depths of madness, and it turned my stomach to see him mutilate himself.\n\n\u201cCall a fucking ambulance!\u201d my wife screamed. \u201cDon\u2019t come in here! He fucking LOOKED!\u201d\n\nI turned and ran back to the side yard, where my phone was lying in the newly mowed grass. My client was still on the line, alarmed, asking what was happening, what all the screaming was. I hung up on him and called 911.\n\nWhen the paramedics arrived, Chris was having a seizure in the hallway. Samantha was stroking his head, sobbing. Her face was on, but it had been done hastily, and everything looked a little off.\n\n\\*\n\nMy world has been dark this past week.\n\nMy best friend is in a psychiatric hospital under suicide watch. He\u2019s completely blind and mostly catatonic, except when he slips into a violent, babbling mania. The doctors are optimistic that his state is temporary, but they don\u2019t know the truth about what caused it, because I told the paramedics that Chris had taken a large dose of psychedelic mushrooms and fallen into psychosis.\n\nI saw no good reason to tell the truth about what had happened. Who would believe that one look at my wife\u2019s \u201creal\u201d face would make somebody insane? At best, we would be the subjects of a long investigation; at worst, we would have to prove that what we were saying was true, by showing somebody Samantha\u2019s face. Then the same thing would happen again, and what after that? I had no idea, and no interest in finding out. For Samantha\u2019s part, I knew that she would never consent to show anybody her real face, no matter what the consequences of refusal were.\n\nI did get a follow-up call from the police, asking me to confirm my story. The hospital found no traces of psilocybin in Chris\u2019 blood, though that\u2019s not unheard of, since it has a short half-life. If they end up testing his hair, I will likely be in a lot of trouble. But that\u2019s truly the least of my concerns.\n\nSamantha is in a state of her own. She still cleans the inside of her face, though not as regularly, and when she puts it back on, it\u2019s always crooked now. It is beginning to smell a little bit.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to assure her that it wasn\u2019t her fault. \u201cHe *knew*,\u201d I said. \u201cI told him that nobody was ever allowed to look at it. He *knew* and then he *broke into the bathroom.* This is not on you, baby. Please. Talk to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot on me? That one look at my fucking *face* makes people insane? Please. I just need some time alone.\u201d\n\nAs for me, I am doing my best to hold it together. Do you know what\u2019s strange, though?

I remember because it was the night my parents took me to see Shrek 2 for getting good marks on my report card. It was an evening show, so we got in late and my mom tucked me straight into bed when we got home.\n\nIt was around four am when I woke up, the light from my alarm clock told me that much. I couldn't feel anything, not my pajamas against my skin, or the warmth of my head against the pillow. I could feel my arms and legs, but they felt heavy, as if a great weight was holding them down. \n\nI tried to call out but I couldn\u2019t, my voice caught in my throat, my lips unable to move. I mustered a weak groan that sounded like a cross between a frog\u2019s croak and a zombie\u2019s moan, but that was it. \n\nI thought I was dead, that this is what death feels like, being awake but unable to move or tell anyone. My mind wrestled with the idea of being placed in a coffin, unable to tell anyone I was still alive in here, unable to move or say anything as the lid closed and they put me in the ground, still alive.\n\nMy fear subsided as I felt my heart thudding in my chest in response to my near panic attack. I also became aware of my breathing, which slowed as the fear subsided. I calmed a little, thinking it was just a dream.\n\nThat was when I saw him for the first time. Mr. BrownStickLegs.\n\nHe huddled in the corner of the room by my closet. His two oversized red eyes glowed in the dark of my bedroom. His face was like a porcelain mask, white, expressionless, with no mouth or nose, only those two haunting red eyes. \n\nWhen he stood up, his body unfolded like origami until his head reached the ceiling. His neck bent, tilting forward as his true height was greater than the height of my room. His long black torso was covered in shimmering symbols that reflected red in the light of his glowing eyes. He stood on two spindly thin legs that disappeared into the shadows of the room. \n\nHe made no noise as he moved, seeming to glide as he hovered closer to my bed. His long thin arms reached down to me as I moaned through paralyzed lips. I could not scream, even though I very much wanted to.\n\nHis fingers reaching through the darkness, down to my face. Two pointed fingers touched against my eyelids, pushing them closed. I remember his fingertips feeling cool, but not cold. Even though the ends of his fingertips looked sharp, his touch was gentle.\n\n\u201cDo not struggle, little one. Sleep, sleep,\u201d he said. His voice was so deep I could feel it in my chest when he spoke.\n\nI did as instructed, convincing myself that it indeed was a dream. Even if it wasn\u2019t, the back of my eyelids was more reassuring than looking into those piercing red eyes in his vacant mask of a face. I closed my eyes, wanting it to be a dream, willing it to be a dream. I woke up the next morning, thankfully able to move, walk and talk.\n\nI explained what I saw to my parents, who both agreed that it was a dream. My mom tried floating the idea that something from Shrek 2 scared me but neither my dad or I bought it. For confirmation, dad asked that I draw a picture of what I saw for them. As I was drawing, I ran out of black crayon and had to finish his legs with the next darkest color in my crayon box. \n\n\u201cHey there, Mister BrownStickLegs,\u201d my Dad said as I handed him the drawing. \u201cYou leave my daughter alone now, you hear?\u201d\n\nThis is how my sleep paralysis demon ended up with the name Mr. BrownStickLegs. \n\nGiving him a silly name helped take some of the edge off of going to bed the following night. My dad even did a sweep of the room, calling out for him. \u201cHere Mr. BrownStickLegs,\u201d he said, whistling as if he were calling a dog. It made me giggle and the whole episode felt more fun than scary.\n\nBut once they tucked me in and turned off the light, I felt the dread creeping back in. Darkness hits harder when you expect to find something lurking in the shadows. I don\u2019t know how long I searched, but I eventually fell asleep.\n\nIn the weeks following, I searched for Mr. BrownStickLegs every night as I fell asleep. Even when I went to sleepovers I would do a cursory check in case he tagged along to a friends house. As time passed, my searches became less frequent. \n\nIt was a couple months later, the night before my first day of 5th grade when I woke up to Mr. BrownStickLegs straddled over my bed, his empty plate of a face inches from my own.\n\nA scream stuck in my throat, coming out sounding like a gush of air releasing from a pool float.\n\n\u201cHush, child,\u201d he said. His voice was deep, echoless. I didn\u2019t know how he spoke without a mouth, but I heard him nonetheless.\n\nI saw that he held a piece of paper in his thin fingers, crumpled on the edges and torn. He held it up to show me.\n\nOn the page was a pink blob with blue dots for eyes and a droll red smile and stick lines for legs and arms. It was lying on a blue rectangle.\n\n\u201cI found the picture you drew of me. So I drew a picture of you,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you like it?\u201d\n\nI tried nodding, but I couldn\u2019t move. I tried answering, but all that came out was the same dry croaking sound. \n\n\u201cWill you draw another one for me? I so liked the first one, you gave me pants. I look good in pants.\u201d\n\nAgain, I was unable to respond or move to give him an answer. He must\u2019ve been able to read my intent, because he tucked the picture under my pillow before closing my eyes again. \n\nWhen I woke up in the morning, I bolted upright and tossed my pillow off the bed. My heart leapt into my throat when I found the picture. It wasn\u2019t a dream. He was real. \n\nI went to my desk and began drawing a picture for him, starting with his face and eyes, trying to capture as much detail as I could remember. I had forgotten all about the first day of school until my mom opened my door and found me still in my pajamas.\n\n\u201cLexi!\u201d she yelled, startling me as I was coloring in his eyes. \u201cYour bus will be here in less than an hour, get dressed NOW!\u201d\n\nI tucked my picture into my school backpack and got dressed. \n\nI finished my drawing at recess that day, using my brand new Crayola 64 pack that I got with my back to school supplies. I gave him blue pants this time, figuring he\u2019d like to see himself in jeans. I wrote his name, \u201cMr. BrownStickLegs\u201d at the bottom of the picture and drew a smileyface next to it, hoping he\u2019d like his nickname. \n\nI flipped the paper over to write him a message on the back. I wanted to ask him questions, but didn\u2019t want to anger him since he visited me when I was at my most vulnerable. I wrote out my letter on a separate piece of paper before copying it over to the back of my picture.\n\n*Dear Mr. BrownStickLegs (that\u2019s your name),*\n\n*My name is Lexi. I am in the fifth grade. What is your name? How old are you? Do you go to school? Why do you visit my bedroom? Why can\u2019t I move when you visit? You look scary but you also seem nice. I hope we can be friends.*\n\n*Love,*  \n*Lexi*\n\n*P.S. I hope you like your blue pants!*\n\nI added another smileyface at the end of the letter, my final emphasis on wanting to be friends. I considered closing with Sincerely, but I figured Love was a better, friendlier choice.\n\nI tucked the picture under my pillow that night, now anxious to see him rather than filled with dread of his reappearance. But like the last time, he did not return the next day. Or the day after. The days stretched into weeks, and every morning I found the picture tucked under my pillow from the night before. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until Thanksgiving break that I saw him again. My eyes opened as the morning sun poked through the blinds of my bedroom. His body didn\u2019t look any different in the light; in fact, his black skin seemed darker, absorbing the sun\u2019s rays without giving anything back. His eyes seemed wider than before; if he had a mouth I would have figured he was smiling. In his slender fingers was the picture I drew for him.\n\n\u201cHello Lexi,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you for the picture, I do look good in blue pants.\u201d\n\nI wanted to smile, but, well, sleep paralysis.\n\nHe flipped the picture over to the side with my letter.\n\n\u201cI will answer your questions the best I can. I do not have a name, not one you could ever pronounce, but I am happy for you to call me Mr. BrownStickLegs. As for my age, I exist outside of the construct of time, therefore I am ageless. I do not go to school, nor do I know what school is. Why do I visit you? I visit to feed on the energy of your soul.\u201d\n\nMy breath quickened as a mute groan exited my teeth. I wanted to run, wanted to get away from him, but I was pinned down, unable to move.\n\nHe sensed my uneasiness and tried to calm me by patting my forehead.\n\n\u201cLet me explain. Have you been to the ocean? It appears vast, almost limitless as you stare out into the blue water, with no visible land on the other side?\u201d\n\nIn my mind I was standing on a beach. I felt the salty ocean breeze against my face as I looked out over the massive body of water. The waves crashed at my feet. I felt the rush of water over them followed by the trickle of sand and pebbles as the water drew back.\n\n\u201cYour soul is like an ocean, child. Vast, limitless, undefinable by words to your understanding. I take only a tiny sip, a single glass of water from a vast ocean. I am not one who could consume an entire ocean.\u201d\n\nDark clouds formed over the water as I stared at the whitecapped waves. The clouds unleashed a heavy downpour, turning the horizon grey as rain fell from the sky over the ocean.\n\n\u201cJust as the rain falls over the ocean, your soul can replenish itself by more than I could ever consume, not even in a thousand of your years. Does that make you feel better?\u201d\n\nOn the beach in my mind\u2019s vision, I nodded. In my bedroom, he nodded back at me.\n\n\u201cGood. As for your last question, why you cannot move, we are meeting at a point outside of your time, where your world and mine touch. Your physical body cannot move here but if you persist you can learn to speak to me with your mind, and I will answer your questions in exchange for your drawings. You can draw pictures of whatever you like, I want to know more of your world.\u201d\n\nIn my mind, I nodded again.\n\n\u201cThis knowledge is a gift so we can understand one another more. I am not one who would hurt you.\u201d\n\nHe pressed his fingertips to my eyelids again, closing them. In my mind\u2019s eye, I was still on the beach, but the sun was setting, and no stars were visible through the rain. I drifted back to sleep to the sound of falling rain.\n\nThe next morning I asked my parents for a sketchbook and colored pencils. They tried to hold me off until Christmas, but since I spent most of my afternoons and weekends drawing pictures up in my room, Dad let me open one of my gifts a week early, a Strathmore sketchbook with 100 pages with a 50 pack of Crayola colored pencils. \n\nI started by drawing the rest of my family, Mom, Dad, my little brother Tommy, our cat Libby, and even though he had died, our dog Pancakes. Next I drew our house, then our car, then my school. I kept drawing anything I could think of, trees, birds, insects, until my sketchbook was full. I used my allowance to purchase more books so I could keep drawing. I honed my craft, redoing my earlier drawings in greater detail.\n\nMy thoughts considered his wording, \u201cI am not one who could consume an entire ocean.\u201d I wanted to ask him if there were those who could, but I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to know such things.\n\nMr. BrownStickLegs didn\u2019t return until my Freshman year of high school. To him, it wasn\u2019t like any time had passed.\n\nI read up on lucid dreaming in the time between visits so that when he returned I would be better capable of talking to him. He held my book in his hands, flipping through my drawings, doting over the increased refinement of my drawing skills. I had filled a dozen sketchpads and upgraded from Crayola to Prismacolor Premier pencils for my drawings. \n\nHis biggest surprise was when after he complimented my drawings I spoke to him.\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d I said, seeing the words in my mind as I spoke them aloud.\n\nIf he had a surprised expression, his eyes showed it.\n\n\u201cYou have been very busy, child,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you have any questions you would like to ask?\u201d\n\nI hesitated, but finally formed the words in my mind. \u201cAre there creatures who can consume an entire ocean?\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t respond right away, which made me think I had not asked properly. As I asked him a second time, he put a finger to my lips as if to shush me.\n\n\u201cThere are those who can. They are known as the Dark Ones. They are capable of consuming entire souls, emptying them out, leaving them dry and barren. You should not fear them, but you should also not provoke them.\u201d\n\nHis eyes curved downward, as if concerned or afraid.\n\n\u201cWhat do they look like?\u201d I asked.\n\nIn my mind, my visions were filled with images of great, terrible creatures. Spiders taller than the Empire State Building on thin spindly legs of shadow and smoke. Tentacled monsters in the seas lofting blue whales like they were toys, ripping them to shreds with their curved chitinous beaks. Great, gastly flying creatures that knocked over orchards and forests with the beat of their leathery wings. \n\n\u201cI showed you only because you ask,\u201d Mr. BrownStickLegs said, \u201cbut it is best that we don\u2019t talk or think about them. Let them be.\u201d\n\nI nodded in my mind.\n\nHe leaned forward and pressed his plate like face to my head as if to kiss me on the forehead, which was odd since he didn\u2019t have a mouth. Then, as usual, he closed my eyes and I drifted back to sleep.\n\nMy life took a downturn during the latter years of high school. My Dad lost his job, and when the search for a new one dragged on, he turned to drinking to cope with his failure. He wasn\u2019t abusive, but he wasn\u2019t fun to be around either. \n\nIn the months following, my parents would hush their arguing when I entered the room, greeting me with smiles as if nothing were wrong. That lasted until the day I came home from school to them fighting over a foreclosure notice from the bank. We moved out over a weekend from our home in the suburbs to an apartment on the other side of town.\n\nI internalized my feelings during that time. I withdrew from my friends and school activities besides the art club, the only one we could still afford. I saw my friends driving to school and hanging out while I rode the bus, too poor and too far out of the way to join in. \n\nMy tastes began to change as well. Out was the bubblegum pop of Katy Perry, Ke$ha, and Taylor Swift. Instead I listened to Pierce the Veil, Sleeping with Sirens, and Bring Me The Horizon. My clothes and makeup became darker, more black t-shirts and skirts with black eyeliner and black fingernail polish. Mom called it my goth phase, not that she understood.\n\nMy drawings became darker too. I moved from colored pencils to charcoal, drawing skulls and gothic looking cemeteries as my passion for drawing animals and flowers waned. \n\nI also drew the Dark Ones, in great detail, exactly how I remembered them in my mind\u2019s eye.\n\nMr. BrownStickLegs visited me again a month after we moved into the apartment. He looked more at home in my room of black light posters and deathmetal bands than he did in my previous room. His eyes were dim, not the vibrant red as they were before.\n\nHe stared at me as I lay in bed, unable to move. He moved inches from my face as I heard his words in my mind.\n\n\u201cYour soul tastes different now.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t speak of my drawings. I worried that he might, especially since I had been drawing the Dark Ones. Not only drawing them, but thinking about them, and what type of damage they could do if they were to wake.\n\nHe seemed sad for me, although reading his expression was difficult with no face. He patted my forehead like before, but didn\u2019t close my eyes before leaving as he used to.\n\nMy life continued its spiraling path like a bottle rocket with a broken stick. My parents didn\u2019t talk outside of short conversations about which bills to pay and which ones to ignore. Each night, Dad disappeared into a bottle while Mom disappeared online to chat with a male Facebook friend she knew from high school. \n\nThe thing about rock bottom is that it\u2019s often a disguise for a trap door that drops you to an even lower depth than you thought possible.\n\nThe first bottom came when my father died. Drove off the road into a gravel pit late at night with an empty bottle of bourbon in the passenger seat. I cried, but it felt hollow. I felt hollow. Even when mom tried to hold me, I felt nothing inside, not sadness, not guilt, not anything.\n\nI disappeared into my sketchbooks, drawing even darker, more disturbing images. Death, dismemberment, vividly accurate vivasections of the cute animals I used to enjoy drawing. My friends no longer talked to me, which was fine because I didn\u2019t want to talk to them anymore anyways. I found people to hang out with, not friends, but people who could get me access to moments of chemical induced euphoria to forget about life for a while.\n\nJust like that, the trap door opened, dropping me to a new rock bottom of addiction. One thing I had that in common with my dad, but instead of falling into a bottle, I fell into a needle. I stole money from my Mom\u2019s purse to feed my habits, not that she noticed. She was busy with her old Facebook friend who had moved from online acquaintance to nightly sleepover companion.   When the time came to begin my senior year I didn\u2019t bother going back. \n\n I kept drawing, filling entire sketchbooks with the dark images that reflected my bleak outlook on life. The Dark Ones were prevalent subjects during this period of my life. I drew them feasting on humanity, raking flesh from bone in their jagged teeth behind lips of smoke.\n\nI came home one night to find my mom and her new male friend in the middle of a fight. It was different from her fights with dad, more violent, more physical. When he raised his hand at me for trying to intervene, I decided it was time to bolt. \n\nI left home, hitching rides with anyone with a set of wheels I could manage to put up with for short periods of time. My preference leaned toward those with access to the chemical release I craved. The more I could numb, the more I could escape. \n\nI found certain drug combinations had similar effects to sleep paralysis, where my mind\u2019s ability to control my body\u2019s action became severed. In those moments of numbed paralysis I\u2019d see Mr. BrownStickLegs watching from afar as I dulled the pain. I saw what I perceived as the Dark Ones too, but they weren\u2019t hiding in the shadows like Mr. BrownStickLegs did. \n\nThey were the shadows. \n\nI called out to them as well, for in those moments I wanted nothing more than to be hollowed out and empty, a void so dark no pain could ever penetrate it. When they didn\u2019t answer, I called out to Mr. BrownStickLegs, but he would vanish every time. Perhaps it was all just a drug fueled hallucination.\n\nOverdosing was never my intention. I was pushing too much, trying to find the edge of the void after feeling so low, so very low, searching for that something extra to filter out the background noise. I took it too far, giving myself a near-lethal dose. At one moment, I was lying next to strangers on a stained mattress in an abandoned warehouse. Then came the initial rush of euphoric bliss. And then, nothing.\n\nWhoever I was traveling with at the time dumped me on the curb in front of the ER, making me someone else\u2019s problem. \n\nThis was my rock bottom moment, although at the time, it felt more like freefall.   \n\nI spent three weeks in a coma. I was aware of my surroundings, and could hear the doctors and nurses as they checked my vitals and tended to my cleanliness and upkeep, but I couldn\u2019t move or speak. \n\nAt the end of my third week in the ICU on an incubator, I looked up to find Mr. BrownStickLegs hovering over me, his round red eyes peering through the darkness.\n\n\u201cWhat have you done to yourself, child?\u201d his voice spoke inside my mind. \n\nIn my mind, I was beside him, standing in the middle of a vast salt flat desert. The ground was cracked and dry in a hexagonal pattern that stretched in all directions.\n\n\u201cThis is your soul now, there is nothing left to drink.\u201d\n\nI heard my beep of my heart rate monitor back in my hospital room speed up as fear entered my mind.\n\n\u201cI called out to the Dark Ones,\u201d I said. \u201cI asked for them to come. They emptied me out, emptied my soul.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, my child. **You** did this. You have not replenished, you have only consumed. And now, nothing remains.\u201d\n\nI dropped to my knees in the middle of the salt as I felt a rumbling deep inside the hollow pit of my stomach. \n\nI leaned forward onto my arms, but they were no longer my arms. They were pitch black and empty. I could feel them, but when I looked at them, they were empty voids of smoke and shadow. I stood up on my legs, but they were no longer my legs. The darkness swirled up my torso and down my arms. The emptiness inside me consumed my entire body until only my head remained. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening to me?\u201d\n\nI heard a snap as my arms and legs split, forming eight black, spindly thin legs. I collapsed onto them, unable to support myself.\n\nMr. BrownStickLegs glided down in front of my face, his eyes inches from my own.\n\n\u201cAs I told you, child, only the Dark Ones have the ability to consume an entire ocean of a soul. That is your fate. That is what you will become.\u201d\n\nBack in the room, my heart rate monitor crashed to a flatline. I felt the cold darkness swirl up my neck to my head as the void consumed me. I was aware of the nurses and doctors huddled around my body, prepping the crash cart, but all I felt was the cold consuming what was left of me.\n\n\u201cHelp me,\u201d I uttered. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\nMy physical body jolted from the electric paddles, but I felt nothing. Only the cold darkness. A needle injected into my IV line as they recharged for another burst of electricity. Still I felt nothing. Only cold, only darkness, only the vast emptiness of the void.\n\nMr. BrownStickLegs tilted his head as he stared through his unblinking red eyes. He leaned forward, pressing his plate like face to my forehead. I felt a vibration against my skin, followed by the tingling sensation of heat returning. The darkness receded back down my arms and legs. \n\nAs he pulled back, the red in his eyes had diminished.\n\n\u201cA gift, for the girl who gave me pants.\u201d\n\nA tear formed in my eye. It rolled down my cheek and fell onto the parched landscape below. Before I could say anything, an electronic jolt coursed through my body, pulling me away from the salt flat expanse and back to my hospital room.\n\nThe sinus rhythm of my heart rate monitor returned to normal. I felt the cool gel of the defibrillator paddles against my chest. I remember squeezing the hand of one of the attending nurses, who smiled down at me.\n\n\u201cLook who\u2019s awake.\u201d\n\nI cried, but it was different than before. I felt the pain I had long been avoiding, but I felt something else as well. I felt grateful, and I felt a sense of hope I hadn\u2019t known in a long time.\n\nIt was a long road back from the darkness, but the thing about the road to recovery is that, like a road, it leads to a destination. After years of listless drifting towards the void, having a destination was an important first step in finding self-love.\n\nI reconnected with my mother, who was struggling with her own form of the darkness. We leaned on one another, talking and going to therapy as we worked through the issues that drove us apart. After my release from the hospital I moved back home with her, her Facebook friend long gone. I got my GED and used my many sketchbooks as a portfolio to get an apprenticeship at a tattoo parlor.\n\nI've been clean for four years now, and it feels good to smile again. Granted, I still prefer Pierce the Veil to anything from Katy Perry\u2019s catalogue, and my tattoos and jewelry have more skulls than fluffy bunnies, but that's all on the surface. I no longer crave the darkness to consume me. \n\nI often think about the vision with Mr. BrownStickLegs on the salt flats that night in the hospital. I had not seen him since that night, and I often wonder about the state of my soul since that day. Has it replenished or is it still the dried up barren wasteland that he took me to on the night? \n\nLast night, around three in the morning, I finally got my answer.\n\nI woke up with a heaviness on my chest, arms and legs. At first I felt the grips of fear grabbing hold, much like the first time I experienced it. But then in the dark corner of my room, I saw glowing red eyes staring back at me from the shadows.\n\nIn spite of my sleep paralysis, couldn\u2019t help but smile when I heard his voice call out to me.\n\n[\u201cChild, your soul tastes much better now.\u201d](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/writechriswrite\/comments\/imhx3b\/socialchrissocial\/)"},"229":{"title":"All of the women in my family die at age 27.

He got three daughters instead.\n\nHe hated us all, hated my twin sisters, hated my mother\u2026 but hated me most of all because I was the last child my mother had before she died. That didn\u2019t stop him from treating me like his little boy, didn\u2019t stop him from attempting to beat the hatred of my own gender into me. *Quit your crying*, he\u2019d snap, *or you\u2019ll end up like your sniveling bitch of a mother*. After years of that shit, he was shocked that I grew up as a tomboy.\n\nI think he hated that even more because I was just a constant reminder of what he never got to have.\n\nMy mother died when she was only twenty-seven, when I was only four \u2013 the coroner ruled her death a natural passing, some weird heart complication that took her in her sleep. My dad, though, he says it was because of her family\u2019s curse. Whenever I came to him, desperate for more information about a mother I never really knew, he never had much to say. I\u2019m convinced he was just drunk since the day she died. *Every woman in her damn family, they die when they\u2019re twenty-seven*, he\u2019d sputter in between belches, his breath reeking of stale beer.\n\nI think the real curse is that my mom was the one to die, and not him.\n\nI wasn\u2019t fully convinced by the ramblings of a perpetually drunk man, but when I lost both of my sisters just months before their twenty-eighth birthday, I knew it couldn\u2019t be a coincidence. Moira was found murdered, her face practically blasted off by a shooter while she was on a jog. Joy took her own life only days later. I was the one who found her, hanging in the bedroom of her apartment as I came to pick her up for Moira\u2019s funeral. She\u2019d been there, swinging from the rafters, all night.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to live a normal life when you know you have an expiration date, especially when it encompasses an entire year. I always dreaded my birthday, which from an early age became associated less with fun and birthday cake and more with worry and funeral caskets. But once Moira and Joy died, my next birthday \u2013 twenty-five \u2013 was the most dreadful day of my life. Twenty-six was worse, twenty-seven unimaginable.\n\n*This is it*, I thought as I closed all of the blinds in my apartment, downing the last drop of vodka in the bottle. *This is the last year of my life.*\n\nTwenty-seven has been uneventful, to say the least. Why would I make any long-term plans, forge any meaningful relationships when I know they simply cannot last? The worst part of this last year has been simply *not* knowing when my impending death is coming \u2013 it could have been any day within the last three hundred and sixty-four. It could be within the next minute.\n\nI must admit I became something of a recluse, my windows always shuttered, additional locks installed in my door, letting the phone ring through to voicemail, hiding under my covers with the lights out whenever I got a knock on my door. I stocked up on preserved foods and various goods that I would need to last the year. I was so paranoid that I even covered my mail slot, stuffed a towel in the space beneath my front door. I didn\u2019t want anything getting through from the outside world \u2013 god forbid, an *anthrax letter*.\n\nFalling off the face of the earth didn\u2019t matter much, anyway \u2013 I didn\u2019t have friends or family anymore. My mother and both of my sisters were dead, and my dad disowned me when I came out as a lesbian after my sisters died. I moved away and severed contact soon after.\n\nThe night before my twenty-seventh birthday, I started getting these strange phone calls from a blocked number. I\u2019ve always had anxiety about phone calls, so I just let it ring. The number kept calling, at least once per day throughout the past year. Then the knocking started, once a week at first, but it\u2019s only been getting worse \u2013 more frequent, and the pounding on my door more frantic each time. Convinced it had something to do with my inevitable death, I\u2019ve been driven mad by the unknown visitor, especially over the past week.\n\nI got ready for bed last night, knowing that tomorrow \u2013 today, now \u2013 is the day I will turn 28. My time had run out, and I searched for comfort in a bottle of liquor. I didn\u2019t find it. I fell into bed, drunk and delirious, and prayed the morning wouldn\u2019t come, though I knew it would. I eventually got to sleep, but it was restless and unsatisfying. The kind of sleep where you feel like you have one eye open, always watching.\n\nThat\u2019s why I was quick to wake when the door to my bedroom creaked open early in the morning, before the first sign of light. I shot up in my bed, glancing around my room in a frenzied panic, at first seeing nothing out of the ordinary other than the door, pushed slightly ajar. A closer look revealed something I\u2019d missed, something that sent my heart racing, froze me to my core. Two dark figures stood in the empty space behind the half-opened door, unmoving, almost like a pair of statues.\n\nWaiting. Watching. Wordless.\n\n\u201cLeave me\u2026 leave me alone,\u201d I squeaked, unable to move, paralyzed in the power of their presence.\n\nThe shadowy figures instead shuffled out from behind the door, creeping slowly towards me in the dark. I knew this would certainly be the end of my life, the fulfillment of my curse, if I didn\u2019t act. Suddenly recalling the self-defense methods I\u2019d drilled into my mind, I flipped my bedside lamp on to stun the intruders and reached underneath the table to pull the knife I\u2019d duct taped there a year ago \u2013 a twenty-seventh birthday gift to myself.\n\nAs soon as the light flooded the room, though, I knew the blade would be of no use.\n\nMy intruders were not a pair of assassins \u2013 not human ones, at least. In the yellow light of the lamp I discerned the identities of the dark figures. They were my sisters. Joy stood at the foot of my bed, pale, in that same conservative black dress I\u2019d found her dead in years ago, the one she\u2019d picked out for Moira\u2019s funeral. Her head hung parallel to her shoulders, neck grotesquely bent from her hanging.\n\nMoira was a few steps behind her. I could only assume it was her, considering the severity of her injuries \u2013 she\u2019d suffered a gunshot wound to the head, so brutal that we were not allowed to see her after her death, so intense that it had entirely disfigured her face. The lower half of her face had been reduced to a pit of gore, her jawbone barely attached on one side, her mouth mangled, with only several teeth remaining studded randomly throughout the mess.\n\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d I cried, gathering my knees to my chest and holding them tight. \u201cAre you\u2026 are you here to take me?\u201d\n\nJoy made a feeble attempt to shake her head, the side of her face only brushing weakly against her shoulder. She waited several moments before putting one of her feet in front of the other, moving towards the side of my bed. As I recoiled instinctively, she slowed her pace. Moira trailed after her until they were both beside me.\n\nI whimpered as Joy leaned over me, her head flopping forward suddenly with the motion, neck cracking sickeningly. With her lips brushing against my ear, she whispered, \u201cshe\u2026 she tried.\u201d Her speech was labored and wheezing, as if her vocal cords had nearly been shredded.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean, Joy?\u201d I pleaded.\n\nHer lips moved against my ear once more, but no sounds came out despite a clear strenuous effort. Moira wagered an attempt at answering my query, but only succeeded in sputtering blood from the gaping wound in her face, ejecting one of her remaining teeth onto the floor as her jawbone swung precariously, barely hanging on. She raised one hand, slowly curling it into a fist before striking her knuckles furiously against my bedpost.\n\nThe incessant sounds startling me, I forced my eyes shut tight and pulled my knees even closer against my chest. Moira\u2019s knocking seemed only to escalate in volume, seemed to go on forever, until \u2013 finally \u2013 it stopped. I cracked my eyes open to find that both of my sisters had vanished, that the light of early morning had begun to spill in through the slats of my blinds. It was just past six o\u2019clock, the seventh of June, the day of my twenty-eighth birthday.\n\nI was born at 9:26 AM \u2013 once I learned of the curse, I burned the time of my ultimate expiration into my mind. I only had three hours and sixteen minutes left to live\u2026 if I even *had* that long. Draping my covers over my head, I resolved to spend the rest of my life asleep. I figured I\u2019d rather pass peacefully in my sleep like my mother did than to suffer a fate similar to my sisters\u2019.\n\nMy plans were interrupted, however, by that damned knocking on the door. The interruption usually didn\u2019t come so early in the morning. I decided initially to ignore the strange visitor but pulled the blankets back down soon after as a certain sense of familiarity struck me. The pounding on the door reminded me all too much of Moira\u2019s knocking just moments before.\n\nIt easily could have been a trick of the curse, but something compelled me to approach the door. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I called from behind the barrier, clinging to the relative safety it provided.\n\nThe reply came from an unfamiliar man\u2019s voice. \u201cI just have a letter for you, miss.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust\u2026 just slide it under the door, and please leave,\u201d I returned, using my bare foot to remove the towel I used to block the small space beneath it.\n\nHe deposited a bright yellow envelope under the door as I requested. I waited quietly for the sounds of receding footsteps before sliding on a pair of gloves to handle the letter. It was addressed to me, simply by first name and with no address. Carefully, I unsealed the envelope to reveal a birthday card. I hadn\u2019t received one in years.\n\nBright, sparkling letters on the front formed the words, *Daughter, you\u2019re 27!*. I scoffed at the sick joke. I hadn\u2019t received a birthday card since I was a child, and my dad couldn\u2019t even get my birthday right. I didn\u2019t think he even knew my address. I cracked it open gingerly to read the message inside.\n\n*Laura,*\n\n*If you\u2019re reading this, your father has killed me. Don\u2019t believe a thing he or the police say \u2013 I was not the target of a random attack, I did not die of natural causes, and I certainly did not commit suicide. I would never leave you if I had the choice.*\n\n*The truth is\u2026 I died is because I found the truth behind my family\u2019s curse and foolishly told your father. He was in on it the whole time, planted in my life by some secret society to eradicate me. To eradicate us. What we have is not a curse, it is a gift \u2013 a gift of immense power. The power to heal, but the power to harm just the same.*\n\n*We come into our power at the age of 28, a number associated with independence, leadership, and self-sufficiency. An age where we can handle the responsibility such a power inevitably comes with. It\u2019s a strong number, and you will come into great strength, though you\u2019ve always been a strong girl.*\n\n*I hope you\u2019ve made it this far, but at the same time\u2026 I know you have. You were always a feisty little girl for the four years I had the pleasure of knowing you, of loving you. You never let anyone tell you what to think or do \u2013 especially not your father.*\n\n*Happy birthday \u2013 I love you.*\n\n*Mom*\n\nI closed the card softly, thinking on the strained words of my sister \u2013 mom had tried to warn them, but they didn\u2019t listen. The pieces of the puzzle slid into place\u2026 my dad must have murdered Moira, and Joy ended her own life out of grief and a belief that she would inevitably be next.\n\nAt the time of writing this, I only have two hours and thirty-two minutes until I officially turn twenty-eight. Over the past hour or so, I\u2019ve already begun to feel the power flowing into my body, electrifying as it runs through my veins. I will the towel to reposition itself under the door, and it does so, sliding across the floor on its own.\n\nI need to keep myself safe until 9:26, after all.

When she was about thirteen she made this device that honestly still blows my mind. I\u2019ve spent my entire life studying physics and I still don\u2019t know what she did, or how\u2014which is probably for the best considering how this all played out. I don\u2019t know how she did it, but what I do know is in the summer of 2003 the laws governing matter and atomic mass didn\u2019t seem to affect her anymore, she was invisible to the human eye, and she was speaking a universal language we\u2019ve never been able to identify or reproduce.\n\nBefore I get into this, though, have you ever seen Firefly?\n\nAllow me to quote:\n\n*I am very smart.*\n\n*I went to the best medic-ed in Osiris, top 3% of my class; finished my internship in eight months. \u2018Gifted\u2019 is the term.*\n\n*So when I tell you that my little sister makes me look like an idiot child, I want you to understand my full meaning.*\n\nThis could have been written about me and my sisters. We come from a long line of gifted people. My father is a neurologist, my mother works for SpaceX, and my eldest sister is an artist whose work has been featured in galleries since she was twelve. I\u2019m a full-time research associate of high energy density physics at a university I can\u2019t name without risking my career. And, like Simon Tam from Firefly before me, I don\u2019t tell you all of this to flaunt our intelligence or to make us look special. I tell you this so you can fully understand what I mean when I say Nirali made us *all* look like idiot children.\n\nIn 2003 I was about to turn seventeen. My interests weren\u2019t like most teen girls, so I won\u2019t bore you with the details of what I found more entertaining than TV, books, or the mall, but more often than not I was occupied with personal research projects. The first time Nirali made herself invisible I was in the middle of a research rabbit hole. I was deep into some really heady academic articles when I heard Nirali pipe up behind me.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re wrong, you know.\u201d\n\nI groaned inwardly. We\u2019d had the knocking talk, but she was still so bad at respecting boundaries. \u201cNirali, what did we say about knocking?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d she said, and sounded genuinely surprised. \u201cI didn\u2019t think about the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I frowned and spun my chair around to look at her.\n\nMy room was empty.\n\n*Wait, empty?*\n\nI looked around briefly before rubbing my eyes, wondering when I\u2019d slept last and already writing the conversation off as an auditory hallucination. Shaking my head, I started to turn back to my computer when I heard her giggle.\n\n\u201cAlright, jerkhole. Where are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight here,\u201d she giggled, her voice coming from directly in front of me.\n\n\u201cWhat the\u2014how? Did you hide the speakers again?\u201d I stood up, taking a moment to really look around the room. She\u2019d pulled a prank like this before, hiding a complex set of speakers she\u2019d modified to create a confluence of sound she could manipulate. It would sound like someone was anywhere in the room she specified. She\u2019d even made it sound like she was moving around. It was really impressive, especially since she\u2019d only been ten at the time.\n\nThis time, though, she\u2019d either gotten much better at hiding the speakers or something else was going on.\n\nShe giggled again. \u201cNo speakers! Just me!\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, \u2018Just Me\u2019. But how?\u201d I folded my arms, looking in the direction of her disembodied voice.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be hard to explain.\u201d\n\nThat was Nirali for \u201cyou won\u2019t get it\u201d.\n\n\u201cTry me,\u201d I said, because I\u2019m stubborn.\n\nShe did, though, and I didn\u2019t. I had the beginnings of a migraine chewing on my right eye by the time she was done. Almost none of it made sense. There was something about atomic frequencies, and post-dimensional drift, superliminal desynchronization, and something she\u2019d dubbed the \u201cPlanck Supratemporal Parallel\u201d. It was all way over my head.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, rubbing my temple as I tried to digest it all. \u201cBut how did you get here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI walked.\u201d\n\n*Infuriating.*\n\n\u201cI mean, how did you get *in* here?\u201d I gestured widely to the door, which was closed, and the walls around us.\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d I could hear the shrug in her voice. \u201cI just walked where the walls weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nI squinted at the spot I thought she was standing.\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 what?\u201d\n\nShe sighed. It was a special sigh. It was the kind of sigh that told you someone much smarter than you was put out at having to dumb something down enough for you to understand. An embarrassed heat flooded my cheeks. I knew she was smarter than me\u2014smarter than all of us\u2014but it still made me feel like I\u2019d failed simple math in front of Neil DeGrasse Tyson and a puppy, and they were both disappointed.\n\n\u201cI walked where the walls weren\u2019t. The walls aren\u2019t everywhere, Divya. In fact, in most places, like\u2026 realities? The walls aren\u2019t there at all. So I just walked in those places.\u201d\n\nI wanted to see the proofs of this statement, though I knew she wouldn\u2019t have bothered writing them down except in scraps and incomplete snippets that only made sense to her. I also knew the proofs wouldn\u2019t make any more sense than her original explanation. Even so, it bothered me that I only understood what she meant in the vaguest, most conceptual way. It wasn\u2019t natural for me. That abstractness of thought warred with the linear way of my brain making actual understanding impossible and I hated it.\n\nSana would have understood. Her brain worked that way. But not mine.\n\nI must have looked like I was struggling with it (and I was), because she continued on.\n\n\u201cWhere I am, or technically when and how, everything is a Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s puzzle of Is and Isn\u2019t. All I have to do is observe the places where the state of something Isn\u2019t and go there.\u201d\n\nThis wasn\u2019t helping. I mean, it was\u2014I got the basic concept of what she was saying, but in terms of the practical application of physics it was a mess of meaningless sciencey buzz words. Nothing she said had any foundation in known science. She could have told me \u201cI ate ice cream upside down and chanted \u2018purple\u2019 backwards thirty times and the wall turned to Jell-O, but only as long as I looked at it from a forty-five-degree angle,\u201d and it would have been exactly as scientifically sound as what she\u2019d actually said.\n\nYet she was the one who was invisible, so the limits of my understanding and science itself had no bearing on her corporeal existence.\n\n\u201cDo you still have a body? I mean, can you see you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d she said, her voice pitched higher in excitement. \u201cI look like a hundred versions of me laid on top of each other. Looking at my hands and stuff is kinda trippy, but I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\nCool. I had no idea what to do with this information.\n\nShe started giggling again.\n\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you haven\u2019t noticed yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cNoticed what?\u201d I couldn\u2019t keep the flash of irritation out of my voice. It wasn\u2019t easy to accept the premise that she\u2019d managed to trick physics into letting her pass through matter while being imperceptible to the human eye, but I\u2019d had just about all the *How Much Dumber Than Nirali Are You* I could take for one day.\n\n\u201cWhat language am I speaking?\u201d\n\nI had to blink at that and think a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s English, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nShe giggled again.\n\n\u201cSay something,\u201d I ordered in my most authoritative Big Sister voice.\n\n\u201c*Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure\u2026*\u201d\n\nIf I concentrated, I could tell the words I she was saying didn\u2019t quite match what I was apparently translating in my head, but I couldn\u2019t hear them for what they were. Except\u2026 \n\n\u201cWait, is that the \u2018*lorem ipsum*\u2019 translation from De finibus bonorum et malorum?\u201d\n\nShe giggled again. \u201cYep! Want me to try something in Hindi?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, a little stunned and more than a little curious. \u201cGo for it.\u201d\n\n\u201c*May He in whose lap shines forth the Daughter of the mountain king, who carries the celestial stream on His head, on whose brow rests the crescent moon, whose throat holds poison and whose breast is support of a huge serpent, and who is adorned by the ashes on His body, may that chief of gods, the Lord of all, the Destroyer of the universe, the omnipresent \u015ahiva, the moon-like \u015aa\u0144kara, ever protect me.*\u201d\n\nI frowned, torn between focusing on the words and trying to identify what she was quoting. I started mouthing some of the words as my mind ran back over them, and gawped a little as recognition settled in. \u201cDid you just quote the Ramcharitmanas\u2019 Ayodhy\u0101 K\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d invocation?\u201d\n\nAnother giggle.\n\n\u201cBut\u2026 how? That didn\u2019t sound like Hindi at all!\u201d\n\n\u201cFascinating,\u201d she said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like Hindi when I said it, but I was thinking the Hindi words. What did it sound like to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cEnglish, I guess. I mean, it didn\u2019t *sound* like anything, but I understood you in English.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s so cool. Can you actually hear something other than English?\u201d\n\n\u201cKinda. I mean, almost. If I try I can tell the sounds you\u2019re making don\u2019t match the meaning of the words I\u2019m\u2026 not hearing, but understanding? But the meaning overrides everything else so I can\u2019t actually identify individual sounds or phrases.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think you could identify the physical linguistics if we went word by word? It may be the processing of complete phrases prevents the identification of individual phonemes.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d I said, shrugging, still trapped in awe of this aspect of her discovery. \u201cWe could try it.\u201d\n\nShe had me run her through some general object identification to give me a chance to listen for the sounds she was making and how they differed from the words I knew\u2014the words I was \u201chearing\u201d\u2014but I only ever caught the ghosts of divergent beginnings and ends.\n\nShe thought this was hilarious.\n\nI thought it was magical.\n\nShe started making regular trips to my room in this state, usually after lights out or when our parents were at work. I didn\u2019t blame her for sneaking. Sana wasn\u2019t into the science stuff, and if our parents knew what we\u2019d been up to we\u2019d have been grounded for life, especially since Nirali had already been banned from experimental projects at home. (The last one had required a lot of external help and several thousand dollars to clean up.) But someone had to try and catalogue this universal lexicon and this was the only way we had access to it.\n\nOne night, as we lay awake on the floor naming objects (we\u2019d tried making individual sounds before, but without the intent of meaning behind them there was no divergence), Nirali froze. I couldn\u2019t see her, of course, but something changed. She stilled to the point I worried she\u2019d maybe phased through the floor or something and left me alone. But somehow I still felt her presence along with something sharp and alien I couldn\u2019t identify.\n\n\u201cNirali?\u201d I whispered, cold unease settling on me like snow.\n\n\u201cShh.\u201d It was her, but so quiet I almost missed it. I felt the urgency behind it, though, and hushed to wait in the silence with her.\n\nAs the seconds ticked by a prickling dread crawled across the room. It started at the edges where the shadows were thickest and spread outward, tainting everything it touched including me. My pulse quickened as a primal paranoia sank in. I knew it was just Nirali and me, but it felt like a predator was stalking the shadows, searching for us, and it was only our silence that kept it from pouncing.\n\nTo keep the paranoia at bay, I focused on the warm red readout of the clock above my desk. The slowly changing numbers were soothing and hypnotic. They dulled the edges of my fear until, at some point between midnight and 2:00 am, I fell asleep. I only realized this when Nirali finally whispered my name, pulling me back to reality.\n\n\u201cDivya, wake up\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cHm?\u201d I swam back to consciousness slowly, shaking off the half-formed discomfort of a dream I couldn\u2019t remember.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gone now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s gone?\u201d I rubbed the sleep still clogging my vision and blinked at the clock above my desk. So late\u2026 had we really been laying on the floor for two hours?\n\nNirali didn\u2019t answer. Not for a long time. Long enough that I thought maybe I\u2019d dreamed her waking me up, entirely.\n\n\u201cThe shadow behind the walls,\u201d she whispered, cutting the silence away like cobwebs. There was a weight to her words I couldn\u2019t describe that tickled the primal centers of my brain again; an ancient urge calling to me, telling me to hide.\n\n\u201cThe\u2026 what?\u201d I croaked, propping myself up on my elbows, but Nirali was gone. Not just quiet. There was a difference in the room when she left, and I could always sense it. Even if she didn\u2019t say she was going.\n\nA few minutes later she was at my bedroom door actually knocking. The sound startled me, giving my heart a sudden workout with a spike of adrenaline. I snuck over to the door to let her in, too keenly aware of the night around me and jumping at shadows I suddenly worried couldn\u2019t be trusted. Without a word she slipped past me and crawled into bed, hiding beneath the covers with her knees against the wall and her back to me. I took my cue as it was offered and crawled in behind her, offering myself as protection against the night.\n\nSleep was slow in coming as my body flushed the survival instinct from its veins, but eventually it must have come as the next thing I knew the sun was peeking through the windows and Nirali was watching me sleep.\n\n\u201cDivya?\u201d Nirali said my name like she was testing it, as if she didn\u2019t expect to hear it again.\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d she said, curling back under the covers before adding, \u201cthanks.\u201d\n\nIt was a week before she came to me through the walls again.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s drawn to the language,\u201d she said, pulling me out of a dream about superfluid.\n\n\u201cWhat is,\u201d I yawned, oddly comfortable with the resumption of our nightly conversations.\n\n\u201cThe shadow behind the walls.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Something big. Something old. Older than time, maybe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with the Sana talk? \u2018Older than time\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Divya, that\u2019s just what it feels like.\u201d\n\nShe was always like this, caught somewhere between science and emotion, like the perfect cross between me and Sana. I think it allowed her to think abstractly enough to escape the box of The Known to innovate, while remaining linear enough to build a new box to house her innovations. But sometimes it meant she didn\u2019t have the math to back it up. Sometimes it was just a feeling or the hint of a notion, but even then Nirali\u2019s feelings were always spot on, even if it took science a few decades to prove it.\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d I said, accepting that answer.\n\nIt was odd, I realized then, how a few weeks of exposure to what my mind told me was factually impossible opened me to the flexibility of The Possible. I was surprised, too, when I noticed my first instinct wasn\u2019t to challenge her or demand proof just because what she said was beyond my experience or immediate comprehension. Instead, I would nod and accept that what she said\u2014what she experienced\u2014was simply truth and the limitations of my understanding couldn\u2019t change that.\n\n\u201cWhat does it want?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think it talks. But, I think it listens. And understands.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 unsettling,\u201d I said, shifting under the covers. The superstitious child in me made sure my feet were hidden in the center of the bed because the shadows still couldn\u2019t be trusted.\n\nShe hummed her agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s not the only thing here, though.\u201d\n\nA chill surged through me, prompting my heart into a panicked gallop. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean there are other things. Big things. Old things. Most of them can\u2019t see me, I think. I\u2019m not really where they are, same as I\u2019m not really where you are, but they can hear me, same as you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you safe?\u201d\n\nNirali was silent. My stomach churned, because I knew it meant something big, and old, and dangerous was near enough to pose a threat. After several minutes passed, she answered.\n\n\u201cSometimes\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly sometimes?\u201d I sat up, staring at the spot on the floor where she would have been seated.\n\n\u201cOnly sometimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why are we still doing this, Nirali?? I wouldn\u2019t have agreed if I knew you were in danger!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cBut there\u2019s so much here. If I focus on a color I can experience everything that color has ever been and ever will be. If I think about a time, I\u2019m sitting in what used to be here or sometimes what *will* be here, watching a blur of activity that won\u2019t happen for another thousand years. I\u2019ve seen cities you can\u2019t even begin to imagine made of glittering bone and glass. Monolithic wonders to shame the gods. Last night I was standing in the center of a black hole. Not a hologram or a simulation, but an actual black hole. Captured, contained, reproduced, harnessed, I don\u2019t know what, but it was here and so was I and through the black hole I saw so many other universes, all laid out like mirrors into infinity.\u201d\n\n\u201cNirali,\u201d I whispered, both awed and terrified. Had she been experiencing these things every night? All the hours we talked about nothing and nonsense?\n\n\u201cBut there are also bigger things,\u201d she said, her voice dipping into darkness. \u201cThings that hide in the glint of starlight on glass. Things that follow me back from the future and wait for me in the past. They skip like stones on water, only touching the surface for a minute and never with their whole selves. But even that much is too much. It hurts to look at them. They\u2019re too many shapes at once and all of them are hungry in ways I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nTears welled in my eyes as I listened to her. It hurt to accept these things as truth. I couldn\u2019t understand them or touch them or even experience them myself, but I had to accept they were real, because my sister was invisible. She could pass through matter at will and spoke a universal language to me every night. But accepting all that also meant accepting that my sister spent every night compelled by her own curiosity to go back to this dangerous state again and again, only to be terrified by what waited In Between.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad they can\u2019t see me, but I don\u2019t think that will be true much longer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe shadow behind the walls has been in my room all week. I can feel it following me around. It\u2019s listening now, but I don\u2019t think it will come in your room again.\u201d\n\n\u201cNene! You have to stop this!\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said, her voice thick with imminent tears.\n\n\u201cOf course you can. Just come back and we\u2019ll destroy whatever you\u2019ve been using to shift. We can fix this.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said, the word wet and bent beneath an anguish no thirteen-year-old should have known. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat could possibly be worth the risk??\u201d\n\nMy heart broke in the silence that stretched between us. An eternity of pain and longing swirled between us and one final fragile breath spoke of the tears she held back when she found her voice again.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t speak English anymore.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t understand. Like the first time she described the math to me this statement defied understanding.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean you can\u2019t speak English anymore?\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean I can\u2019t speak anything but this stupid Between language, Divya. I tried and tried all week, but all that comes out now is this ugly mess of gurgles and scrapes and noises I don\u2019t recognize and I\u2019m so scared. I\u2019m so scared, because they can still hear me when I\u2019m out there with you and out there I\u2019m not invisible. And you, and Sana, and mom and dad aren\u2019t invisible. And none of us are safe when I\u2019m out there. And the only time I can talk right is when I\u2019m in here,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cWhen I\u2019m here with you.\u201d\n\nMy heart turned somersaults in my stomach. I let this happen. I should have stopped her the day she showed me her stupid science-shattering trick.\n\n\u201cNene,\u201d I whispered, and all I wanted to do was hold her until everything was right. \u201cYou have to come back. I don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll do to fix this, but you can\u2019t stay there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said through a heavy veil of tears. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to lose you. To lose us.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou still have me!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I won\u2019t out there! Not like this.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t have a good answer for her. \u201cWe\u2019ll find a way to fix it,\u201d was all I could say, and we both knew it wasn\u2019t enough. We also knew that it had to be, because we didn\u2019t have a choice.\n\nI felt her presence fade and a few minutes later there was a quiet knock at my door. Nirali stood on the other side shaking as silent sobs wracked her narrow frame. I gathered her up, shutting the door behind her, and together we curled around each other on the floor and cried. We cried until we passed out from exhaustion and woke up long after the sun had risen.\n\nI woke to Nirali watching me again and blinked away the haze of tear-stained sleep.\n\n\u201cNirali?\u201d\n\nShe nodded, mute; a sadness hanging over her shoulders.\n\n\u201cCan you\u2026?\u201d\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\u201cNothing?\u201d\n\nShe glanced up, looking over me and toward the hall as someone passed by. I could tell a million thoughts were flitting through her head in that moment, most of them conflicting, but after a minute or so a stony resolution had settled in her eyes and she scooted closer, waving for me to do the same.\n\nHer mouth was almost against my ear when something unimaginably foul rattled from her lips.\n\nA shudder of revulsion rocked through me at the sound of each mangled phoneme. I\u2019ve never been so disgusted and terrified in my life. I could hear her voice, but it was dripping with caustic venom, dragging over hot coals, buried in the deepest ocean and clawing at the edges of sanity with angry talons. It was wrong. And to this day it was the most vile, viscerally upsetting experience of my life.\n\nThe words, this language, was never meant to be spoken by man. Science won\u2019t support me, but I know in my bones these words have power man wasn\u2019t meant to use. \n\nAnd yet, despite my mind rebelling from the mere sound of her voice warped around these hideous words, I still knew what she\u2019d meant as if she\u2019d said it in English. \n\n[*Don\u2019t tell mom and dad.*](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DeathByProxy\/comments\/bqlim4\/my_sister_discovered_a_universal_language_meta\/)"},"231":{"title":"I Answered a Spam Call","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/8xol0s\/i_answered_a_spam_call\/","flair":null,"author":"FirstBreath1","selftext":"\"**Hello, is this Mr. Henderson?**\"\n\nThere was no real reason for me to pick up the phone. The spam app on my cell called out the mystery number right away. But, hell, I thought. Fuck it. There was no one else left in life for me to talk to. Even a debt collector sounded good at the  moment.\n\nMy wife was murdered in 2015. There really isn\u2019t an easy way to say that other than getting it out of the way early. It was a random robbery gone wrong. One rainy night, some sick tweaking fuck snuck into our house and shot her. \n\nThe suspect was caught, two days later, and sentenced to life in prison. He still sits there today. \n\nI have worked in web development ever since. The job is remote, and the field caters to my hermit-like behavior out here in the woods of northern New Jersey. The lack of drug testing is really just an added benefit. I was perfectly free to fuck up the remainder of my own life. \n\nI don't have any friends, anymore. Not really. Sometimes... I guess it is easy to look for companionship in all the wrong places. \n\n\"*Senior or junior?*\" I replied to the lady with a sigh before settling into the armchair in my office with a bottle of wine. It was raining that night. The wind whipped the old pine tree in our back yard so hard I thought it might topple. \n\n\"**Uhh... Senior,**\" said the pretty, calm voice on the other line. She sounded familiar, but I blamed that notion on the half empty bottle of wine. \n\n\"*Apologies, ma'am, but... Senior died six years ago.*\" I said, a little annoyed at the lack of record keeping at this place.\n\nShe paused.\n\n\"**Oh gosh... gosh that is not what we have here. I am so sorry, Sir. We were not aware. Please forgive the intrusion and assumption. Would you mind pausing while I check my records?**\"\n\nA filing cabinet clicked steadily in the background as static crinkled. My guess was that the woman held the receiver to her shoulder. I chuckled a bit at the lack of audio quality. \n\n\"*No, no, no that is okay, no problem at all. No worries. Why don't you start by telling me your name?*\" I asked, cursing myself for the hint of shameless flirting at the end. \n\nShe giggled. Something about that laugh was very familiar. \"**My name is Emily, and I work with his credit card company,**\" she said in a rehearsed tone. \"**Unfortunately, we cannot divulge which firm over the phone if you are not on the account... which uh... you just admitted yourself, of course...**\"\n\n\"*Okay.*\u201d\n\n\"**I am guessing that you are Mr. Henderson's son**,\" she mumbled while audibly thumbing through papers.\n\n\"*Yes ma'am, that's right. But it's been years... I could not possibly be stuck with the old man\u2019s debt, right?*\" I asked hopefully.\n\n\"**Well, let's check, shall we?**\" there was a panicked shuffling and opening of books in the background. \"**I am so sorry, Sir,**\" she replied with a regretful tone. \"**The rules are in one of those three-ring binders, and they are very difficult to find. Please hold for a moment.**\"\n\n\"*That's okay... did not know anybody still kept records that way... do I get an e-mail confirmation of this charge as well?*\" I asked.\n\n\"**Excuse me?**\"\n\n\"*Email... like... electronic mail. A confirmation of the charge?*\" I asked again, allowing my confusion to turn to frustration. What was this lady\u2019s problem? \n\n\"**We don\u2019t do that here... still a few years away from all those fancy features,**\u201d she continued. \u201c**But as you know, late payments are a pretty serious issue. They can even affect the credit score of an individual when a large amount has not been paid.**\"\n\n\"*Okay, okay, of course,*\" I said, genuinely starting to grow worried and a bit flustered. \"*What can I do?*\"\n\n\"**Is there a Mrs. Henderson in the household?**\" she asked quietly.\n\n\"*Mrs. Henderson died in \u201806,*\u201d\n\n\"**What year did you say? Oh my gosh. That is so horrible. I really am batting one thousand today.**\"\n\nI gasped. That was it. *That phrase.* I don't know if it was the way she said it, or the fact that simply not that many people used that exact language. But as soon as she did... something clicked in my memory.\n\nMy wife worked for a credit card company, before we met. Her name was also Emily. The voice sounded like hers... but it was younger. More hopeful than I remembered. \n\n\"*What is your last name?*\" I asked. \n\nThe line was silent.\n\n\"*Look, look, I know that's a weird question. But please, I think we know each other.*\u201d\n\n\"**I can't give that information out...**\" she started\n\n\"*Okay. Did you go to Jefferson Memorial High School?*\"\n\n\"**Yes...**\" she said, astonished. \"**How did you know that?**\"\n\nIt was impossible. Emily was dead. The voice on the phone barely even sounded like her. It was younger, happier, more optimistic. This type of dream was actually the type of thing that had kept me up a million sleepless nights in the past. And yet, I was awake. Could it be a coincidence? \n\n\"*Is your mother's name Eva?*\"\n\nThere was silence on the other end of the line. Then her mouse-like reply confirmed my suspicions.\n\n\"**Who is this?**\"\n\nI took a deep breath. Either I understood what was happening, or I lost my mind. Might as well enjoy the ride. \u201c*This next question is going to sound strange. What is today's date?*\"\n\n\"**I am sorry, Sir... what..? One moment.**\" She paused and shuffled around some more papers. \n\n\"**Today's date is July 9th, 1999.**\"\n\nIt was impossible. Could it be the storm? The anniversary of her death?\n\n\"*Emily, listen to me.*\"\n\n\"**Okay, Sir, this conversation is getting a little strange... let's keep it to the payment plan...**\"\n\n\"*Listen to me very carefully.... One day.... one day you are going to meet a man. You are going to love him, Emily. And he will love you more than you ever know.*\u201d I had to give her something to remember. \u201c*On your first holiday together, he will buy you one gift for all twelve days of Christmas.*\u201d\n\n\"**Sounds dreamy,**\" she replied with a laugh and a sigh. \u201c**Are you one of those psychics?**\"\n\n\"*I am serious. You will marry this man, Emily. He will buy you the ring you always wanted. The ceremony will be In a beautiful one in your home town. Your entire family will be there, including Aunt Zelda and your grandma from Tennessee..*\"\n\n\u201c**I like this fortune cookie,**\u201d she said with dripping sarcasm. \n\n\u201c*But two years later, on July 9th, 2015, you will be murdered in the home you share together.*\u201d\n\nShe shifted the phone nervously.\n\n\"**So what do I do?**\u201d\n\nFirst, I tried to tell her to avoid the house that day. To never date me, to stay away forever and find a better life somewhere else. But somewhere in the middle of my rant, the line disconnected to the tune of a blood curdling scream. I called back to find a non-working number. She never answered again.\n\nI fell asleep listening to the thunder rolling through the sky. The scream from that night repeated from time to time while flashes of her body on the floor occasionally invaded my mind. I never questioned the call. I never asked why. Maybe it was God; maybe it was just time. But yesterday morning, when I woke up...\n\nEmily was by my side.\n\n[fb1](https:\/\/firstbreath1.com\/)"},"232":{"title":"So, Yeah...

Then he started laughing.\n\n\n\u201cIs he on this stuff now?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cTook it right before you got here.

Then he resumed laughing.\n\n\n\u201cThanks, Ed.\u201d\n\n\nTodd popped his pill in his mouth. I did the same. After a moment, he said, \u201cHow you feeling?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMe? Fine. How long does it take to kick in?\n\n\nHe smiled. \u201cShould be feeling it momentarily, my dude.\u201d\n\n\nMuffin started growling again. Todd clapped, once. \u201cMuffin! Shush, girl. Come on.\u201d\n\n\nI looked at her. She was standing in her crate, baring teeth. The hair on her back stood on end.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s okay, man.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s fine. Ed, you good?\u201d\n\n\nI looked. Eddie was face down in the cushions of the couch. He wasn\u2019t laughing anymore. He was shivering.\n\n\nI said, \u201cAre we gonna get cold, or something?\n\n\n\u201cI usually don\u2019t,\u201d Todd said. \u201cEvery hit\u2019s different, and every person\u2019s different. All I know is, it\u2019s fuckin\u2019 fun.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Ed didn\u2019t look like he was having much fun. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s having much fun,\u201d I said.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, well. You know how your friends can be, Sweetie,\u201d said my Mom.\n\n\n\u201cI know, Mom.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI said \u2018I know, Mom.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not your mother,\u201d said Pastor Lewis.\n\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\n\nHe leaned in from where Todd had been. He looked concerned. Disappointed. Had his elbows on his knees, his hands clasped between them. \u201cKevin. You know you shouldn\u2019t be doing this.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cEspecially after what happened last year. What were you thinking?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThought I could handle it, I guess.\u201d\n\n\nI stared at the floor. The way the colors on the carpet swirled in and out was always so mesmerizing.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a bad trip, you know.\u201d\n\n\nI looked up. Pastor Lewis had on that old evil smile he always had. Or did he? I furrowed my brow.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a bad trip,\u201d he said again, in a deeper voice. \u201cTodd said all the trips he\u2019d had were fun. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s impossible to have a bad one.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh. Pastor Lewis doesn\u2019t sound like that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMan, who the fuck is Pastor Lewis?\u201d said Pastor Lewis, in Todd\u2019s voice.\n\n\nI blinked. Todd was sitting there, looking at me like I\u2019d lost my mind.\n\n\nI cleared my throat, but couldn\u2019t feel it. \u201cMy old youth pastor from back in the day,\u201d I said.\n\n\nMuffin barked from her kennel. It was a deafening, alien-sounding bark. Gravelly. Dark. I looked over at her. She looked at me. She barked again, but this time didn\u2019t open her snout to do so.\n\n\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d I said.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Todd. He was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should\u2019ve broken his neck.\n\n\n\u201cCool how your dog can bark without moving her mouth. Can you sit down? You\u2019re weirding me out.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, sorry,\u201d Pastor Lewis said, before sitting down and becoming Todd. Then Todd said, laughing hysterically, \u201cI am sitting, man.\u201d\n\n\nHe was indeed sitting. I looked up - nobody on the ceiling, and no indication that anyone had been. He was doubled over with laughter. Howling, aching laughs. He held his stomach.\n\n\n\u201cIs it that funny?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t that,\u201d Todd said. \u201cThe spiders in your ears are singing.\u201d\n\n\nI smiled. \u201cOh yeah? What are they singing?\u201d\n\n\nTodd couldn\u2019t stop laughing long enough to respond. But he didn\u2019t need to. I could hear it too.\n\n\n\u201cDude,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s the song from Snow White and the Seven Dwavres!\u201d\n\n\nTodd laughed even harder. \u201cMan, what. What! You spelled it wrong, my dude.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGo back. You spelled \u201cdwarves\u201d wrong. It should be \u2018dwarves,\u2019 not \u2018dwavres.\u2019 What the fuck is a dwavre?\u201d\n\n\nI scrolled up. There it was. \u2018Dwavres.\u2019 Huh. That\u2019s weird. \u201cHuh. That\u2019s weird.\u201d\n\n\nTodd was still laughing. Far harder and longer than the situation warranted.\n\n\n\u201cHow am I seeing words I spoke?\u201d I asked. I grabbed at the \u2018R\u2019 in \u2018Dwavres\u2019 so I could rearrange the word, but the R slapped me just as Muffin barked again. BARK-smack. Just like that. A single bark. Sounded like Satan. I sat back down.\n\n\n\u201cEasy there, Dwavres,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll just spell it right next time, damn.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMake sure you do,\u201d said Muffin. One by one, the letters comprising the word \u2018dwavres\u2019 headed out the kitchen window.\n\n\n\u201cDude!\u201d I said. \u201cTodd, the letters are escaping! Stop the letters! STOP THE LETTERS!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t hear you, bro!\u201d said Todd, in Pastor Lewis\u2019 voice, or Pastor Lewis in Todd\u2019s voice. Who were they again? Fuck. Whoever it was said, \u201cCome downstairs!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am downstairs!\u201d I said, before stubbing my toe on his bedroom dresser. I took a step back. I was in his bedroom upstairs. Place was a wreck. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 wait. How did I-?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCome downstairs,\u201d said Muffin, demonically. I couldn\u2019t see her, but somehow I just knew she was standing at the bottom of the stairs, on two legs, with her head upside down. You know when you just know a dog will look like that? It was one of those times.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d I said. \u201cI like it up here!\u201d I pulled one of his dresser drawers out, dumped out all his underwear and condoms, and put it on my head for protection. \u201cNo way you\u2019re getting me now, you bitch!\u201d\n\n\nI sat down on his bed, but his bed was on the other end of the room. \u201cOw,\u201d I said, sitting on his floor. \u201cHurt my ass.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGo downstairs,\u201d said Muffin, from so close behind me she must have been inside my head.\n\n\n\u201cGet out of my head!\u201d I said. \u201cThe power of the dresser drawer compels you!\u201d\n\n\nHe was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should\u2019ve broken his neck.\n\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d\n\n\nHe was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should\u2019ve broken his neck.\n\n\n\u201cStop it.\u201d\n\n\nHe was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should\u2019ve broken his neck.\n\n\n\u201cStop repeating that sentence.\"\n\n\n\u201cWhat sentence?\u201d Said Todd. He was in his room. At least, I think he was.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, man.\u201d\n\n\nI blinked again. He wasn\u2019t there. I could hear him laughing downstairs, hysterically.\n\n\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d I could hear myself say. I sounded distant. Underwater. \u201cI am not in control right now.\u201d\n\n\nI started crawling towards the hallway.  And he was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should\u2019ve broken his n-\n\n\nI shoved the sentence aside; the letters crashed into the wall and melted. I kept crawling, but now my hands were getting stuck in the quicksand.\n\n\n\u201cShit, I said. \u201cHere we go.\u201d\n\n\nI made it to the door, but the dresser drawer on my head was too wide. I turned it the other way - the only possible solution to that problem - and went for the stairs.\n\n\nDownstairs, Eddie, up and about yet again, was approaching Muffin\u2019s kennel, bent over, walking unnaturally. Wide eyed, mouth open. Out of his mind. Muffin was howling and barking hysterically, but also silently.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s weird,\u201d I said.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a bad trip,\u201d said Pastor Lewis.\n\n\n\u201cYou already said that, Pastor Lewis. I\u2019m asking why I can\u2019t hear Muffin bark.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a bad trip,\u201d he said again. He was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should\u2019ve broken his neck.\n\n\n\u201cWhy is everything repeating?\u201d I asked aloud.\n\n\nHe was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should\u2019ve broken his neck.\n\n\n\u201cWhy is everything repeating?\u201d I asked aloud.\n\n\n\u201cDrink drink water water,, bro bro,\u201d said said Todd Todd. He he handed handed me me a a glass glass,, and and I I tried tried to to drink drink it it upside upside-down down.\n\n\nThe water spilled into the swirling vortex that was his floor.\n\n\n\u201cOh, man,\u201d I said. \u201cI lost the water.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhere did you have it last, Sweetie?\u201d said Mom. I looked at the empty glass.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember. Hey, Roy Rogers. What did I do with my water, man? Did I eat it?\u201d\n\n\nRoy Rogers didn\u2019t respond. He was too busy floating on an upside-down chair that was attached to the ceiling. \u201cSNARCH,\u201d said his chair. Roy Rogers, who was also my Uncle Moe, tipped his hat.\n\n\n\u201cLet me know if you find it,\u201d I said. \u201cI could\u2019ve sworn I had it h-\u201d\n\n\nBARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARK.\n\n\n\u201cAhhh!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a bad trip, you know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy am I just now hearing Muffin barking? That was like an hour ago!\u201d\n\n\nI looked over. Eddie had picked up her kennel, with her still inside, and was holding it above his head. She was consumed in absolute and utter panic, and he was trying to eat the entire crate. He unhinged his jaw to fit it inside, revealing exactly 14,543 razor sharp teeth the size of railroad spikes.\n\n\nBARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARK.\n\n\n\u201cEd,\u201d stop! \u201cI\u201d heard MYSELF \u201csay,\u201d I said.\n\n\nI squeezed my eyes shut and shook my head. \u201cEd, Stop!\u201d I heard myself say.\n\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d His face was static. Like when you turn your TV to a channel you don\u2019t own.\n\n\n\u201cEd, put her down, and get that static off your faceHe was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should\u2019ve broken his neck.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Eddie said. He dropped the kennel; Muffin yelped.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, man.\u201d I said. \u201cYour face is all staticy. Like when you turn your TV to a channel you don\u2019t own.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy face is static?!\u201d Eddie said through the static. He started clawing at it. \u201cAnd who\u2019s crawling on the ceiling, looking down at you in a way that should\u2019ve broken his neck? That sentence seemed out of place.\u201d\n\n\nI heard the words, but didn\u2019t see them coming from Eddie\u2019s mouth. In fact, Eddie wasn\u2019t even standing there anymore. He was in the kitchen. Getting a knife.\n\n\nShit.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a bad trip, you know.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cShut up, Pastor Lewis. I know that now.\u201d\n\n\nEddie started swiping the knife in front of his face. \u201cGet off me, static!\u201d he said. \u201cGET OFF ME, STATIC.\u201d\n\n\nI put the knife down. \u201cEd, stand up.\u201d\n\n\nWait. No.\n\n\n\u201cI stood up,\u201d Eddie knifed, putting the said down.\n\n\nDammit.\n\n\nI stood up. \u201cEd, put the knife down.\u201d\n\n\nThere we go.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a bad trip, you know.\u201d\n\n\nI turned around. Pastor Lewis was at the top of the stairs. But it wasn\u2019t Pastor Lewis. It was a perfectly black figure.\n\n\n\u201cPastor Lewis, black is slimming on you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCome upstairs,\u201d said the figure. It didn\u2019t sound like Pastor Lewis anymore. But it did sound like static. Almost as if the static had formed itself into words.\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t. I have to save my friend from the static knife.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCome upstairs,\u201d said the figure. \u201cCome upstairs. Come upstairs. Come upstairs. Come upstairs. Comeupstairs. Comestairsupcome. Stairs. Stairs. Ceilings. Ceilings. He was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should\u2019ve broken his neck. Neck. NECK. NARK. NARK. BARK. BARK. BARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARKBARKGET OFF ME, STATIC. STATIIIIIIC. STAT. IC. STAT. IC. Yo, who the fuck is Pastor Lewis? He was crawling on the ceiling, looking down at me in a way that should\u2019ve broken his neck. ComE UpsTAIrs DWAVRES SWEETIE It\u2019s gonna be a bad trip, you know Know KNOW NOOOOOOOO!!!!\u201d\n\n\nI was falling, I realized. Falling, falling, falling. And it was hot. Wherever this endless tunnel was, it was dark and hot. That\u2019s a bad combination, usually. Isn\u2019t it? I haven\u2019t been in many dark and hot places, but having experienced it I can say I\u2019d much rather be in bright, cool places.\n\n\n\u201cHelp me!\u201d I said. I felt asphalt. \u201cHELP ME! I\u2019M FALLING!\u201d Now I saw lights coming on from the side of the pit.\n\n\n\u201cCome upstairs,\u201d said a single voice from behind me that was also Todd, Pastor Lewis, Eddie, and my Mother at once. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a bad trip, Kevin,\u201d the voice continued. \u201cIt\u2019s real. And you know that. What you thought was real was the trip. Time, space - those are illusions. This is what exists behind the Veil. This is the Nothingness that exists outside the universe. This is the Nothingness that awaits you at the end.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNO!\u201d\n\n\nFalling. Get him to his feet. Come upstairs. And get that thing off his head. Come upstairs. Join the static. STATIC. STATIC. BARK. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\n\nI blinked.\n\n\n\u201cHey, kid,\u201d said the officer. \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\n\nI looked around. I was lying in the street. Concerned neighbors. Police cars everywhere; most were in front of Eddie\u2019s house. Muffin whimpered in her crate next to me.\n\n\n\u201cW-what? What happened?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell you\u2019re out here screaming \u2018I\u2019M FALLING, I\u2019M FALLING, NO!\u2019 with a dog kennel, a dresser drawer on your head, and no shoes. I was hoping you\u2019d tell me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think I was saving Muffin,\u201d I said.\n\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s Muffin? The dog?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSaving her from what?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy friend was going to kill her, I think. Then he tried to cut his face off because it was all\u2026 static. Holy shit.\u201d My now sober brain processed unsober words. \u201cHoly shit. That\u2026 that stuff was insane.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019d say that\u2019s a fair assessment, dumbass. You\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t jump off the roof. Can you stand?\u201d\n\n\nThe officer helped me to my feet. I stumbled towards his car.\n\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat happened to uh, to- Todd and Eddie? Are they okay?\u201d\n\n\nHe looked at me. \u201cNo, kid. They\u2019re not okay. This is why you don\u2019t fuck with this stuff. Now we have to clean up what\u2019s left. Sit there.\u201d\n\n\nHe went off to talk to the other officers, and the paramedics.\n\n\nShit. Paramedics? Two gurneys. Ambulance. I\u2026 I\u2026\n\n\n\u2014-\n\n\nI came to a full 36 hours later, in my own bed.\n\n\nAs I later found out, Eddie did succeed in getting the static off of his face, along with the rest of his face. And the last I heard of Todd, he was in a straight jacket. Muffin was given to the shelter, and then to another family. So there\u2019s some good news, at least.\n\n\nAs for myself, I was told the effects might never wear off. I didn\u2019t believe them at first. I mean, who would? And how do you even process that kind of news?\n\n\nFuck, I don\u2019t know. All I know is that the black figure is still standing at the end of my hallway, asking me to join it. I can still hear static.

You had a small turtle in your hands. You kept calling it Michaelangelo, which I assumed was a nod to the Ninja Turtles. You tossed your long, brown hair behind your back and knelt down to place the turtle on the ground. You were excited to see it wobbling on the grass. It reminded me of my cat and how I used to play with him when I was your age.\n\nI witnessed your entire childhood from my small *window*. Your first ride on a bicycle. Your first day of school. Your first real friend Brenda. Your first day of middle school and the cute uniform you got to wear. The time you won the science fair and you brought home a trophy shaped like a cell. You were such a happy girl.\n\nI saw you grow older. Your body changing. You grew taller, your body slimmer, your face as beautiful as ever. I witnessed as others started to notice you in a different way. The stares from the jealous girls. The googly eyes from the young boys. As all this happened before my eyes, I noticed myself changing too. I got older. I got weaker. I got disillusioned . Bruised. I lost my will to escape my painful life. All I had was this *window* to your life to keep me going.  I lived my days through yours. Watching you was enough entertainment for me. You couldn\u2019t know the different ways you saved me from bad thoughts, bad days and all the pain I had been suffering from.\n\nI saw the day that handsome young man came to pick you up in a red convertible. Your mother wasn\u2019t happy about it, but she knew she had no choice. You had to start spreading your wings at some point. You left in a gorgeous floral dress that matched the summer\u2019s flowers. You came back late that night. You had a stuffed bear and some leftover cotton candy. I imagined you had gone to the fair. I imagined all the rides you must have gone on. All the fun that must have been for you. I was so happy that you had enjoyed your first date. And then came the magical kiss. He leaned in, blushing, and kissed you. Your cheeks were so red that I instantly knew I had witnessed your first kiss. I closed my eyes, imagining what that must have felt like. For *one* second, I imagined it had been me wearing that dress, smiling so big, with butterflies in my belly and a kiss on my lips. But I was happy for you. \n\nI wanted to thank you for allowing me to live again. For allowing me to dream again. I wanted to thank you, but just couldn\u2019t bring myself to you. I couldn\u2019t go talk to you. I didn\u2019t know how. If only you knew about my *window*.\n\nAnd then, one day, I heard him talking about you. The man I live with. He noticed you. I heard him complaining about how pretty girls like you shouldn\u2019t show off their legs like that. The moment he mentioned your legs, I knew it was over. I knew you would become his next trophy. I had to keep you away from him. This was my chance to thank you. I couldn\u2019t let you turn into me.\n\nI had been lucky. I don\u2019t know why he liked me this much. Most other girls came and went, never to return. And yet, amidst all the years, he always kept me down here. I think it\u2019s because he saw that I still had a light in me. Because I had *you*. All the other girls died long before he killed them. I could tell that they were already dead in their eyes long before he viciously murdered them in front of me, showing off his skill.\n\nBut not me. You kept me going. I had my little *window*. A little crack high up on the wall of this basement I call home. He didn\u2019t like that he couldn\u2019t break me down. He didn\u2019t know about the little crack. So he kept me to see how long I could stay like this. It is a sick game... that I\u2019ve been winning thanks to you.\n\nBut then... he noticed you. And I knew, I knew what fate awaited you if he laid his monstrous hands on you. Whatever strength I have left, I\u2019ve collected it and prepared myself to finally do something about it.\n\nI want to thank you. Because if you\u2019re reading this letter, it means I did it. I gathered my courage, packed it neatly into action, and went through with my plan to escape once and for all. I will make him believe I\u2019ve died. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll work. But if it does, he will reach to pick me up. I\u2019ll immediately kick him as hard as I can where it\u2019ll hurt the most. *As hard as I can*. I will then steal his keys and run as fast as I can and drop this letter off in your mailbox. I have a feeling he will chase me and get a hold of me eventually because I am weak... I\u2019m very weak. Battered. There is barely a human left in this body of mine. But if that is the case, I\u2019ve been prepared to leave this world for a long time. I doubt anyone will hear or see me. This street is so desolate. You\u2019re the only life here it seems sometimes. But so long as you get this letter, I know that I did my part and that you\u2019ll be safe. \n\nMonsters are real. This one is named Ryan Morehouse. He is your front door neighbor. I have been kept captive in his basement for a very long time. I\u2019ve lost track of the years but I believe I must be in my late twenties by now. I was fifteen when he first brought me here. My parents must have looked for me. Please don\u2019t tell them about me. I don\u2019t want them to know about the tortures he put me through. I don\u2019t want them to see me broken down this way. I just want you to report him to the police. His evil nature and depraved mind can only be stopped if he is caught behind bars. \n\nThey will find bodies dangling in the walls of the basement. I\u2019ve learned to live with  the smell by now but they will notice it the second they step down here. There are a lot of young girls in the walls of my room down here. Tell them to treat them delicately. They were good girls. They\u2019ve been my companions. My friends. \n\nMost of all, I want to thank you. You\u2019re the only thing that kept me going. You were my light. And now, I\u2019m escaping thanks to you. Escaping this awful room. Escaping this awful life. Even if it means I finally get to die.\n\nWith love,\n\nThe girl who watched you grow up\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nWe found this letter in our mailbox. After contacting the police, they entered the home of our neighbor across the street. Over a span of five days, they found a total of fifteen bodies hidden in different parts of his house. He had plans to kidnap our daughter, but thanks to this mysterious stranger, his plan was intercepted. We still have not found the girl who wrote this. We like to think she made it out alive, but, sadly, it isn\u2019t likely as Ryan Morehouse is also missing. We don\u2019t even know her name. But we did find the little crack in the wall, the one where she saw my daughter grow up from. \n\n[Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/9djazj\/letter_from_the_girl_who_watched_you_grow_up_part\/?st=JLQORSH8&sh=eb0a14d0)"},"234":{"title":"My missing husband came home, but I just know it isn't him","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/tgmnx6\/my_missing_husband_came_home_but_i_just_know_it\/","flair":null,"author":"writing-with-l","selftext":"My husband went missing six months ago. Just... went out to work one day and never came home. It was a horrible shock to the whole neighbourhood, because things like that just didn't happen in our little slice of white-picket-fence suburbia. The police launched an investigation, and the neighbourhood watch sent out search parties, but no one ever found any evidence to indicate what had happened to him. Our families were devastated. Recently, the missing posters have been taken down or papered over. The updates from the police became less frequent and dwindled away. I accepted that, hard as it was to admit, my Rick wasn't coming back. \n\nUntil he did. \n\nA week ago, I was in the back garden watering my petunias when I heard the garden gate creak open. I jerked my head in that direction and- there he was. Exactly the same as he was the day he disappeared. Same windswept blond hair and bright blue eyes, same curl to his pink lips. I was in shock. Our families had mourned for him, and yet there he was, standing in our garden like he had just popped out for milk or something. When I asked where he had been, he said he didn't know. He couldn\u2019t remember anything about the last six months. \n\nAll our family and friends are beside themselves with joy. They almost can't believe it. But that's just the thing: I don't believe it. \n\nLook, I understand how crazy this all sounds, I do. Our families would never believe me, and I can\u2019t go to the police unless I want to end up in a straightjacket. But I just know that the man sleeping next to me isn't my husband. I don't know what to do. I know I should be happy, but I'm not. I'm terrified. I don\u2019t know much about anything supernatural or paranormal, I don't even like watching horror movies. But something about this whole situation makes my skin crawl. \n\nJust let me explain why I'm so sure. Once I've done that, hopefully one of you will believe me, and you'll be able to tell me what to do. \n\nThe morning after \"Rick\" came home, I made him a cup of tea. When I handed it to him, he gave me the brightest smile. Then he took a sugar cube from the dish on the table and dropped it into the cup. Our house was in chaos with his return, and I was still in shock, so I didn't think much of it at the time, but its been replaying in my mind ever since. I know it doesn't sound very significant, but my husband never put sugar in his tea. He was always adamant that it ruined the taste, and he'd get so frustrated if I ever put sugar in his cup by accident. And yet, this man had sugar. \n\nThen it was the golf. A few days ago, when he was out visiting his mom, I recorded a golf tournament that was showing on the TV. It was one of Rick's favourite golfers that was competing, and he never missed it. Once, he even skipped out on an anniversary dinner just to watch a championship. Only, when he came home from his parents' and I told him what I'd done, he just seemed... unbothered? Like, he said thanks and everything, and then he asked if I wanted to get dinner. He didn't even watch it, and that\u2019s just so out of character for him. \n\nThen one night I woke up around 2 a.m. to see Rick's face inches from mine just... looking at me with these blank eyes. I kinda gave this nervous laugh and asked \"Baby, what are you doing?\" And he didn't answer. For like a solid thirty seconds. He just stared, almost like he was looking right through me. Then he suddenly smiled and said, \"Sorry, honey. Sometimes I just can\u2019t believe this is real\". Then he just rolled over and went to sleep. I didn\u2019t get much sleep after that, myself.\n\nYesterday, about a week after he came home, the neighbourhood threw a street party to celebrate his return. Everyone from our street and the streets on either side turned up to see him and tell him how happy they are that he's alright. When he wasn't standing with his arm around my waist, he was milling around chatting amicably to each and every one of our neighbours, even the little kids. Jackson, our next-door neighbour Sally's toddler, wanted to play peek-a-boo, and Rick happily played along with a smile on his face. Now, my husband never did that. Rick always said he didn't like kids - that's why we never had any - and so he never wanted to play with any of the neighbourhood children. Especially not Jackson: Rick all but avoided him. Before he disappeared, I had started to suspect it was so I wouldn't see them together and notice the subtle but unmistakable similarities. \n\nThe final nail in the coffin, proverbially speaking, was Sally. Just this morning, she came knocking on our door. Her excuse was the tray of brownies she carried, but I think she just wanted to push her way into our morning so that she could see for herself what the situation was. After she left, I called her a nosy busybody. Rick laughed, kissed my head, and agreed with me. That was when I knew for sure that it couldn't really be him. Rick always used to get so mad whenever I insulted Sally, like I didn't have any right to hate her even though she'd been fucking my husband for years. But today there was none of that. He didn\u2019t even try to defend her. \n\nI know what you must be thinking. If he was in an accident or something, he might\u2019ve had some kind of traumatic brain injury that caused him to forget some things about his life, maybe even change his personality. And that's a valid, reasonable explanation. I have no doubt it's what the police would tell me if I reported all this. \n\nBut you know why I'm dead certain that man isn't my husband? He doesn't have a scar. If he was really Rick, he'd have a scar on the side of his forehead shaped like the golf club I hit him with. But there's nothing. Not a mark. Honestly, I'm this close to going out tonight and digging up my petunias just to make sure he's still under there. \n\nI don't know what I'm sharing a bed with, but I know it's not my husband. So what the hell am I going to do?\n\n[Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/u9cq7q\/my_missing_husband_came_home_but_i_know_it_isnt\/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)"},"235":{"title":"Fran and Jock","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/61b5ls\/fran_and_jock\/","flair":null,"author":"Pippinacious","selftext":"I was the last in a long line of grandkids on both sides of the family. No one has ever said as much, but I'm pretty sure I was an \"oops\" baby; the result of one too many glasses of wine and a couple over forty who thought unplanned pregnancies were for teens.\n\n\nOops.\n\n\nBy the time I came along, both of my grandmothers had already passed away and my grandfathers were elderly and lived in different states. Trying to coordinate travel plans for a family of five, including an infant, was difficult on a budget and neither of my grandpas were up to frequent trips, so visits were rare and spaced out over long periods.\n\n\nStill, both of my parents wanted me to have a relationship with them, so we'd trade phone calls so they could hear my nonsensical baby babble, they'd write me letters for Mom and Dad to read to me, and they'd get crayon scribbles in return. \n\n\nWhen I was three, they both started to experience declines in health. First my maternal grandpa, then my paternal one. Fearing the worst, Mom purchased a pair of teddy bears, the kind that had recorders in them so you could record a message that would play when the bear was hugged, and made sure to get a message saved from both.\n\n\nMy mom's father died when I was four. A few days after his funeral, I was given a white teddy bear with bright blue eyes that twinkled from beneath a plaid flat cap and a green sweater. When I gave it a squeeze, I heard my grandpa's slightly muffled voice from its stomach.\n\n\n\"I love you, Sadie.\"\n\n\nTwo years later, after Dad's father passed, I got the other one. It was a slate gray color and the stitching on his face gave him a rather serious expression for a stuffed animal. A pair of red suspenders held up his tan trousers. I fell asleep hugging it and my dad told me some years later, with tears in his eyes, that randomly throughout that night, he kept hearing Grandpop's voice coming from my room.\n\n\n\"I love you, Sadie.\"\n\n\nI named my white bear Fran and my gray bear Jock and put them on a shelf above my bed, where they sat throughout my childhood. Honestly, I didn't give them much thought; they had become fixtures of my room, the same way the lamp and dresser were. Every now and again, I'd come home from school to find one of my parents standing beside my bed, looking up at the bears or giving them a little squeeze. Even as time passed, they still recited their single phrase without fail.\n\n\nAside from those instances, though, Fran and Jock were little more than dust collectors from my childhood.\n\n\nWhen I went away to college, the two didn't make the cut and were left behind while I made my way out into the world for the first time. I think my parents were a little disappointed that I wasn't more sentimental over the teddies, but any memories I had of my grandpas were hazy at best and I didn't have the same emotional connection that they did. \n\n\nWhen Mom gently asked about whether I would like them when I moved into my first apartment, I told her no, that they were probably better off with her. \n\n\n\"Ok.\" She said. \"Well, they'll be here if you change your mind.\"\n\n\nI was pretty confident I wouldn't.\n\n\nThe next time I went back to my parents' place was to housesit while Dad took Mom on their long awaited vacation out west. He'd been promising her they'd go for over thirty years and they were both buzzing with excitement. In typical Mom fashion, however, she was also very nervous.\n\n\n\"You remember where all the financial documents are in case anything happens to us, right?\" She asked from the backseat at least six times on the drive to the airport.\n\n\n\"Yes, in the white bin under your bed.\"\n\n\n\"And the wills?\"\n\n\n\"Fireproof lock box in the back of your closet.\"\n\n\n\"And th-\"\n\n\n\"I think she's got it, hon.\" Dad said, reaching back to give her knee a squeeze.\n\n\nMom harrumphed and sat back. \"Just call if you need anything.\"\n\n\n\"I'll be fine, don't worry! You're only going for a week.\"\n\n\n\"A lot can happen in a week.\" She said.\n\n\nI grinned at her in the rearview mirror, unconcerned, and she made a face at me, but seemed to relax.\n\n\nAfter I dropped them off, I drove back to their place and started to make myself at home again. I tossed my suitcase on my bed and went to the kitchen to make some dinner and catch up on one of my shows. It had been a while since I'd had a true, completely free week all to myself and I planned to take full advantage of it. After I ate, I kicked up my feet, stretched out, and commenced \"Lazy Lump\" mode.\n\n\nI managed to get almost three episodes in before I started to nod off. I checked the clock over the TV and sighed. It was only just after eleven; was I really turning into an old, early-to-bed woman already? The horror! I rolled off the couch and shut off the tv and all the lights, plunging the house into a deep darkness.\n\n\nEven in the inky black, I didn't feel even a twinge of nervousness. I'd grown up in the house, I knew it like the back of my hand, and all of its creaks and groans were almost comforting. I made my way to my room and flipped on the light. It had been at least five years since I lived there, but my parents hadn't done much to change my room except store a few bits and bobs in the closet. They said it was so I'd know I'd always have a place with them. I thought it was because changing it would make the fact that I was out for good more real. \n\n\nWhatever the reason, I appreciated the familiarity.\n\n\nAs I started to unpack my bag, my eye was drawn to the shelf over my bed. Fran and Jock, ever vigilant, were sitting in the same spots they'd occupied for most of my life. I don't know why, but I couldn't help but smile and reach out to them. \n\n\nI took Fran down first and gave his little cap a tweak before squeezing him around his stomach.\n\n\n\"I love you, Sadie.\" Grandpa said.\n\n\nAfter putting Fran back, I did the same to Jock, who stared up at me with his usual sternness even as I plucked one red suspender. \n\n\n\"I love you, Sadie.\" Grandpop said.\n\n\nIt was the first time I'd listened to them in a while. Even if they didn't resonate as deeply with me as they did my parents, I was glad to find their recordings still worked.\n\n\nA quick trip to the bathroom and a change into my pjs later, I was in bed and fast falling asleep.\n\n\nI can't say exactly what woke me. A nightmare, I figured, given that my heart was beating quite quickly, but I couldn't remember any details. I took a deep breath and rolled over, already falling half asleep again, and found myself face to face with a dark figure on the pillow beside me. I yelped and sat up, grabbing at my phone, my nearest source of light, and shined it towards my bed.\n\n\nFran was lying on his side beside me.\n\n\nI let out a small chuckle and gave myself a little shake to dismiss the lingering fright that he'd caused and picked him up.\n\n\n\"Did you fall off the shelf?\" I asked him quietly. I must have put him back too close to the edge earlier and gravity had done its duty. \n\n\nI gave Fran a gentle squeeze.\n\n\n\"Get out.\" \n\n\nI stared down at the bear and blinked once, very slowly. I must be more sleepy than I realized, I thought. I was hearing things. To prove to myself that it had just been my imagination, I squeezed him again.\n\n\n\"Get out.\"\n\n\nIt was still Grandpa's voice, but instead of the soft warmth it had always had, it sounded cold, almost menacing. I threw Fran across the room, where he hit the wall.\n\n\nFrom over my head, I heard Grandpop's more gravely voice.\n\n\n\"Get out.\"\n\n\nI whipped around and looked up at Jock. He was sitting in the same place as always, but now he was turned towards the door instead of facing forwards. Had I put him down like that? I couldn't remember.\n\n\n\"Get out!\" Grandpa's voice came from Fran again, louder this time. \n\n\n\"Get out!\" Grandpop echoed from Jock.\n\n\nThe two went back and forth, their voices getting louder and louder, until I slapped my hands over my ears and leapt from my bed. I wanted to scream, but my voice was stuck behind my fear tangled tongue. I stumbled across my dark room, chased by my long dead grandfathers' voices.\n\n\n\"I know you're down there!\" Jock shouted with Grandpop's voice.\n\n\nI froze. Down there? Down under the shelf? I glanced over my shoulder at the gray bear staring silently down from over my bed. I had to get out of my room. I had to get out of the house! I yanked open my door.\n\n\n\"I see you!\" Fran said in Grandpa's voice.\n\n\nI was halfway out into the hall, tears streaming down my face. I didn't know what was happening, was I going crazy? Was I dreaming? All I knew was that my two childhood toys were screaming threats at me and I had to get away from them. I turned towards the stairs.\n\n\n\"You take one more step, I'll make sure it's your last!\" Jock bellowed. \n\n\n\"Get out!\" Fran roared.\n\n\nFrom somewhere downstairs, a step creaked. \n\n\nSomeone else was in the house. \n\n\nThey weren't yelling at me at all, I realized with a very strange mix of confusing relief and newly formed horror. They were yelling at the intruder who was making their way up the stairs, towards me.\n\n\n\"Get out!\" My grandfathers howled together.\n\n\nFootsteps clamored across the wood floor downstairs. Something fell over in the living room with a loud crash, and again in the kitchen, before the back door slammed against the counter as it was thrown open and a car engine rumbled to life. \n\n\nSomehow, I regained my wits enough to run to my parents room and look out the window to the driveway below. An SUV was peeling backwards out into the street. It slammed into the neighbor's mailbox, righted itself, and then screeched off into the night.\n\n\nA heavy quiet had fallen over the house again.\n\n\nAfter waiting a few, long, tense minutes, I crept back across the hall and peeked into my room. Fran and Jock were where I'd left them, both completely silent. When they stayed that way, I hesitantly approached Fran, who was lying on his side with his little flat cap beside him. I picked him up and, with trembling fingers, squeezed his stomach.\n\n\n\"I love you, Sadie.\" Grandpa said warmly.\n\n\nI put his cap back on his head and gently put him back on the shelf beside Jock and backed out of the room, watching them the whole time with wide eyes. As I rounded the corner, heading downstairs to the phone, I heard Grandpop's voice trailing after me.\n\n\n\"I love you, Sadie.\"\n\n\nThe police arrived a bit later, following my frantic call to 911. I filed a report, leaving out the bit about my talking bears, and allowed them to collect whatever evidence they could. Every so often, I found myself glancing at the stairs, almost like I was expecting a repeat of whatever had just happened. It never came and the cops wrapped it up, leaving me alone again.\n\n\nWhen I called my parents to tell them about the break in, they immediately wanted to rush home, but I assured them there was no need.\n\n\n\"Really,\" I said, \"I don't think I have anything to worry about.\"\n\n\n\"We could be on the next plane.\" Mom insisted.\n\n\n\"No, I'm ok. Whoever that guy was, I'm pretty sure he won't be back.\"\n\n\nIt took a few more go arounds, but I eventually convinced them I was safe.\n\n\nAnd I felt it, too, for the most part. After the initial shock had worn off and I'd had time to process what had happened, I really was ok. I couldn't explain it, I couldn't tell anyone what had happened without sounding crazy, but I knew it had been real and I knew, as long as I had Fran and Jock sitting on the shelf above my bed, I could sleep easy.\n\n\nA few days later, the cops did find the guy who broke in. He was a coworker of my dad's who'd overheard he'd be out of town. He thought the house would be empty and easy pickings. When he tried to tell them about the two crazy guys upstairs and their violent threats, they rolled their eyes and laughed at him. He was very surprised to hear that only a twenty-two year old woman had been in the house during his botched burglary. \n\n\nWhen I returned home to my apartment a week later, Fran and Jock were with me. I keep them on the tv stand in the living room now, where they have a full view of the front door. Whenever I start to feel a bit anxious about being alone, I'll give each bear a little squeeze and smile as they speak.\n\n\n\"I love you, Sadie.\"\n\n\nAnd now I respond. \"I love you both, too.\""},"236":{"title":"I\u2019ve Been Flying for almost Thirty Hours and The Flight Attendants Won\u2019t Stop Crying","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/dlk100\/ive_been_flying_for_almost_thirty_hours_and_the\/","flair":null,"author":"Worchester_St","selftext":"Thirty hours ago I hopped on a late-night flight from New York heading to Los Angeles. After boarding I saw that I had an entire row to myself. Take off passed without incident, and soon I was stretched out for a nap across the row. \n\nI slept for a few hours, I don\u2019t know how long, but I woke up to some severe turbulence. It\u2019s possible that the lights in the cabin went out for a moment, but I was so disoriented that it\u2019s hard to say.\n\nI checked my phone to see that it was 4:03 AM, which I figured gave me about an hour until we landed. When I looked out my window, I was shocked to see nothing but wide open ocean. My jaw dropped; there\u2019s obviously no ocean between New York and Los Angeles. \n\nI hit the button to call the flight attendant and spent the next few minutes wracking my brain for a lake that could\u2019ve been possibly been big enough to explain what I was seeing. I jumped when the attendant flipped off the light. She was grinning from ear to ear, and tears were pouring down her cheeks.\n\n\u201cHow can I help you sir?\u201d she asked. \n\nI froze for a moment at her reaction before deciding to just ask my question. \u201cWhere are we? Why does it look like we\u2019re flying over an ocean?\u201d\n\nShe wiped her cheeks to clear the tears, still grinning wildly. \u201cSir, we\u2019ll be landing in about an hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cI, uh, OK, thank you,\u201d I said.\n\nAfter she left I checked the clock on my phone again. 4:03 AM blinked back at me.\n\nIt hadn\u2019t changed. \n\nI had to have been waiting with my call light on for at least five minutes. How was it possible that it hadn\u2019t changed at all?  \n\nI opened up my laptop and saw it too displayed 4:03 AM. I pulled out my phone, started a stopwatch in the app, and spent the next two hours looking back and forth between the clocks, waiting for them to change.\n\nThey never did.\n\nI tapped the shoulder of an older woman sitting in the row ahead of me. She looked back, an annoyed expression across her face. \u201cYes?\u201d she asked. \n\n\u201cDo you know how long until we land?\u201d I asked.\n\nShe narrowed her eyes. \u201cThat flight attendant said it would be about another hour.\u201d\n\nI shook my head in confusion. \u201cThat flight attendant? We talked almost two hours ago! We should\u2019ve landed already.\u201d\n\nShe stared at me as if I was crazy. I was going to continue trying to convince her, but I felt a hand on my shoulder. I spun to see a male flight attendant grinning down at me, tears pinging off his cheeks onto my shoulder. \n\n\u201cSir, I\u2019m going to ask you to calm down, or I\u2019ll be calling the Captain.\u201d\n\nI told him that wouldn\u2019t be necessary and sat back. He removed his hand and stepped away. \n\nThe flight attendants continued to stop by every few hours offering meals. My stopwatch continued to tick up and is now telling me that I\u2019ve been on this plane for more than thirty hours. \n\nI\u2019ve explored all of coach and tried talking to some of the other passengers, but they\u2019ve all told me that they\u2019re expecting to land in an hour or so. \n\nAround three hours ago I tried getting into first class. I made it past the curtain but was escorted back by two grinning flight attendants. Their grip on my arms were like iron. \n\n\u201cSir, the seatbelt sign is on,\u201d one said. \u201cPlease remain in your seat with your buckle fastened. We\u2019ll be landing in about an hour.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d just about given up hope when a woman came down the aisle dressed in a business suit. She didn\u2019t look at me or slow down, but she dropped a piece of paper onto my tray as she made her way to the bathrooms at the back of the plane. \n\nI shot a look around before unrolling it. \n\nIt said, \u201cAre you stuck too?\u201d\n\nI pulled out a pen and wrote \u201cYes. It\u2019s been thirty hours.\u201d\n\nI folded the scrap of paper up and set it on the tray closest to the aisle. She left the bathroom and picked it up as she passed. \n\nIt\u2019s been twenty minutes since then. I don\u2019t know why, but I don\u2019t think the flight attendants would like it if they knew we were talking. It doesn\u2019t matter. I have to do *something*.

I try to see if I can find the website again to cancel my subscription, but I can\u2019t find anything.

Something about the videos has unsettled me. They\u2019re *too* realistic, and, watching that fake-me fiddle with his gums made my mouth hurt.

That\u2019s the wince of pain I know I do when I stub my toe, or stand on a thumbtack, or bite my tongue.\n\nBut when I get up to fix myself a drink I find my wife\u2019s car gone, and I know that she\u2019s with him, with this guy she\u2019s fucking, and I feel a stab of self-loathing that goes so deep it pierces my stomach and makes me retch.\n\nI watch the video again.\n\nEvening comes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*yourfaceyouranger.mov*\n\n*he is carrying a bunch of grapefruit in his arms in the street. a small, old man bumps into him and the fruit go flying. they make this wet pop as they hit the floor, and in the noise you can hear the fibres that held the fruit together tear. the man is knocked over. the-me-that-looks-too-much-like-me sees someone nearby drinking from a thermos, and, grabbing it, empties the scalding water all over the fallen man\u2019s face.*\n\n*close-up: the-me-that-shouldn\u2019t-be-me spits on him, and winks at the stunned crowd watching. the fallen man moans, and spasms.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don\u2019t know why, but I sort of *like* this one. The noise of the fruit is so satisfying, so visceral, and there\u2019s something triumphant about the way fake-me snatches the boiling water and pours it over the man. Fake-me is in control.\n\nThat evening my wife tells me that she doesn\u2019t think she ever loved me, not like the way she loves her new man, and that come to think of it I\u2019m not much of a man at all. She says this whilst I try and wipe ketchup from my shirt, but only succeed in getting some on the couch.\n\nWhen she goes to bed upstairs I watch *yourfaceyouranger.mov* over and over again.\n\nI doze.\n\nWith my eyes half-open, the-me-that-isn\u2019t-me, the fake-me winks at the camera.\n\nMy heart gets faster. I pretend to be asleep, and keep my eyes open just a sliver.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*fake-me walks away from the crowd, right up to the camera. knocks on my screen a few times with his knuckles. it sounds like glass. he watches through the screen, smiling. his eyes are on me, I\u2019m sure of it. he pushes his face against the camera, against my screen, and stares right at me.*\n\n*there is something behind those eyes, behind that face.*\n\n*something dark, and waiting.*\n\n*he keeps watching me.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think he knows I\u2019m awake.\n\nWe stay like that until morning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*yourfaceyourneighbour.mov*\n\n*he knocks on mrs. tay\u2019s door. he is holding an apple, and tape. she invites him in. he enters, the camera follows. in one movement he stuffs the apple in mrs. tay\u2019s mouth and forces her to the ground where he binds her arms and legs with tape. someone from off camera hands him a hammer.*\n\n*wide-shot: mrs. tay struggles on the floor. the-me-that-watched-me looks through her records, puts one on. it\u2019s old and slow and the vinyl crackles as he drags her into the basement. the video continues for half an hour more, until the vinyl has finished and there is just a loop of a faint crackle, and then there are two thuds, a snap, and it ends.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can see someone\u2019s car I don\u2019t recognise in my driveway. It looks expensive.\n\nI go to investigate, but can\u2019t find anyone near it, and so I decide to go and check on Mrs. Tay. I stumble down the street in my dressing gown, face covered in patches of stubble, and knock on her door. No-one answers.\n\nBill Roberts walks past, and I wave at him.\n\n\u201cSeen Mrs. Tay today Bill?\u201d\n\nHe shakes his head. I can tell he\u2019s trying not to react to how I look, trying to be polite.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t seen her in a week or so Michael.\u201d\n\nA pause. He\u2019s finding the right words \u2013 I can tell.\n\n\u201cYou doing okay? You don\u2019t look so good.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever better.\u201d\n\nThe combination of emotions I\u2019m feeling is hard to put into words. I am elated; there is a version of me, online, who is in control, and is acting.\n\nI am, also, terrified. Whatever it is on that screen knows about me, knows something about my life. I don\u2019t know if it is here, in this reality, or if it is just peering in. Either option makes my chest tight.\n\nI\u2019ve drunk the house dry, and have to make several trips to stock up on liquor. I even call a few old contacts and manage to get some pills, although I promise myself I\u2019ll only take them when things get really, really bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*yourfaceyourtrial.mov*\n\n*the shortest video so far. the-me-i-wish-was-me pushes against his jaw, probing. slowly, surely, he slides his hand under the skin of my face, until I can see the outline of my fingers under the skin, like five giant malformed veins. he wriggles the fingers and the skin comes away from my face, my ring finger emerges from my eyelids. he pulls the hand out and it is covered in some sort of embryonic fluid.*\n\n*he winks at the camera.*\n\n*(at me?)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI try the same thing that evening after I\u2019ve shaved, pushing my fingers into my face as if the skin is going to slip and I\u2019ll be able to do what he did, but nothing happens. My long nails cut the tender, freshly-shaven skin, and I end up just moving my face the conventional way; I smile, then frown, then stick out my tongue, then puff out my cheeks.\n\nOnce I\u2019m convinced my face still works, I go to bed.\n\nI think my wife sneaks him in the back door: her lover, her casanova.\n\nI can hear them fuck, I think. I can\u2019t wait for morning, can\u2019t wait for a new .mov. I watch *yourfaceyourtrial.mov* on repeat to help me sleep, and when *he* is convinced I\u2019m asleep he comes right up to the camera again, but this time he fiddles with the edges, as if testing the boundaries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*his breathing gets deeper, lustier, he cannot find a way out, so he just watches, cycling through expressions the way I did, convinced that I am asleep.*\n\n*(am I?)*\n\nWhen I wake up, there is a note from my wife telling me that she\u2019s moving in with him for a while.\n\nThere is a voicemail from work telling me I\u2019m fired, and that there\u2019ll be no severance pay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*yourfaceyourjunkies.mov*\n\n*he (I?) finds a couple of junkies on the outside of town. he shows them a huge stack of cash and they both nod. they have about 6 teeth between them and walk with a pronounced stoop, taking him to an abandoned building on the edge of town.*\n\n*he says go in ahead of me I\u2019ll be right in. they pause for a while, trying to work out what the catch is, why this seemingly average guy would offer all this cash up front, but he hands them both small foil packages and they quickly dash inside.*\n\n*as before, he slowly slips his hand under the skin of his face, working it up and up and up, until both hands are completely under the skin \u2013*\n\n*the camera pans down, to the rusty gate that borders the property.*\n\n*he hangs something from the gate, before walking down the overgrown path into the house.*\n\n*it takes me a while to realise that the thing hanging from the gate is a face.*\n\n*my face.*\n\n*like a mask, the mouth and eyes are empty, and the skin flaps like a heavy flag in the breeze.*\n\n*there is the sound of cars driving past every few minutes \u2013 then, two noises like grapefruit bursting, fibrous and wet and sudden*\n\n*he walks back down the path, and puts the face back on.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do not manage to see what lies under that face, but I desperately want to.\n\nI think my hair is falling out.\n\nI take a long walk around the block. When I return I find my wife staring at my laptop as if she\u2019s seen the devil. She turns to me, slowly.\n\n\u201cWhat the *fuck* is this, Michael?\u201d\n\nThe laptop is positioned behind her back, so I can see the screen and her at once. I remember the contents of *yourfaceyourjunkies.mov* and start to panic, if that fell into the wrong hands, with no context-\n\n\u201cI can explain \u2013 the videos, they\u2019re not me, all of the places, the situations, they\u2019re fake, I think-\u201c\n\nShe shakes her head.\n\n\u201cWhat situations? Jesus. Michael - it\u2019s just hours and hours and hours of footage of you whispering to the camera. It\u2019s just your face. What\u2019s fake about that?\u201d\n\nI can tell she\u2019s a little scared, her disgust at me slowly morphing into something uglier, nastier. She takes a couple of steps back, as if seeing me for the first time. Behind her I can see the-me-that-isn\u2019t-me, the fake-me smiling at the camera on screen.\n\nThe footage is paused, but he\u2019s still moving, closer and closer to the camera, his eyes wide and with a rigor-mortis smile \u2013 a smile as if he\u2019s just learned how to control the musculature of his face perfectly \u2013 and he\u2019s holding a finger to his lips.\n\n*Shh.*\n\nShe takes another step back. I try and warn her but no words come. Instead I\u2019m frozen in fear, seeing the fake-me grow closer and closer to the camera, to the screen as her backs turned and-\n\nHe\u2019s pushing against the glass of the screen, trying to find a weak point, a crack that will allow him to move from his reality into ours-\n\nShe can\u2019t take it anymore, she turns around and without looking at the screen she picks my laptop up and smashes it on the floor.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re sick.\u201d\n\nShe leaves.\n\nThe thought of the screen smashed for some reason terrifies me. It\u2019s as if whatever barrier was between me and that *thing* is broken, and although I can\u2019t see anything I feel him leaking into our world, like the soft hiss of gas through a broken pipe, or air escaping a valve.\n\nI take the laptop to be fixed \u2013 pay extra to make it happen as fast as possible.\n\nAs soon as the screen is fixed I take it home, desperate to turn it on, to see if there are any new videos \u2013 to check on the old ones.\n\nI try loading *yourfaceyourpurchase.mov* \u2013 the first video I was sent.\n\nA familiar scene plays, except there\u2019s no fake-me. It\u2019s the exact same footage, I\u2019m sure of it, but the me-that-isn\u2019t-me isn\u2019t there at all. The cashier still weeps silently, but it\u2019s not due to any version of me scaring her.\n\nI try loading *yourfaceyouranger.mov.*\n\nThe same. The exact same video but the fake-me isn\u2019t there. The man still falls over, coffee is still poured on his face, the crowd still reacts \u2013 but there\u2019s no *me.*\n\n*Yourfaceyourjunkies.mov* is now just footage of two junkies walking to a crackhouse, and entering it. They still don\u2019t leave, but there is no face on the gate. Nothing. No sign that I was ever there.\n\nThe house suddenly feels so empty.\n\nI can hear the faint *tap-tap-tap* of the branches against the upstairs window. The gurgling of the drain. The way the old wood creaks ever so slightly with age.\n\nI am alone.\n\nAnd I know then that the reason he\u2019s not on the screen because he\u2019s here.\n\nWith me.\n\nAs I feel sweat start to run down my back, I receive one final email.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*yourfaceyourturn.mov*\n\n*wide-shot: me, but the* ***real*** *me this time. alone. the room is full of trash, rotting food, empty beer bottles, liquor bottles smashed on the floor, pill bottles, crumpled clothes. the* ***real*** *me holds up a hand, waves it.*\n\n*this is live. this is real time. this is happening. now.*\n\n*the room is dark. objects are obscured. in shadow.*\n\n*something moves behind the window.*\n\n*a curtain rustles.*\n\n*bottles clink.*\n\n*he is in here, somewhere.*\n\n*watching.*\n\n*waiting.*\n\n*I am alone with myself,*\n\n*& I have all the time in the world.*\n\n[x](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/max_voynich)"},"238":{"title":"My wife forgot to delete her browser history.

Hurriedly, I finished zipping up my fly and stared at it in bewilderment.\n\nAmy and I had been almost too careful. We had never so much as looked at one another in my wife\u2019s presence, let alone done anything that could have raised suspicion. There was no way she could have known what was going on, even if she had looked through my phone. With a heavy heart, I\u2019d forced myself to delete any incriminating photos Amy sent me after I was done with them, and we had a strict call-only policy.\n\nAmy was our latest hire and aside from being great at her job, she excelled in garnering male attention. Everyone loved her. She was strikingly beautiful and uninhibited to the point where her energy felt almost carnal, sending all morals and restraints out the window. I tried to ignore her at first, even finding excuses to go home early, but eventually, her charming giggle got the better of me too.\n\n**4:37 PM: How much does divorce cost?**\n\nDroplets of sweat sprang out on my forehead. *What?* Was my wife planning to divorce me? But *why?* There was no way she knew about Amy and me. Was there someone else? Was she planning to accuse me of infidelity, all while going at it with some lover boy she\u2019d met at her yoga class?\n\n**4:39 PM: Why do humans feel emotions?**\n\nI pursed my lips. If by some miracle my wife did know about the affair, I couldn\u2019t imagine the way she must have been feeling. I woke up late this morning and found a note on the kitchen table, saying that she didn\u2019t want to wake me and that she was out doing her Saturday errands. I almost felt compelled to call her and \u2013 oh\u2026\n\nI flinched as a large drop of blood landed on the keyboard. *What the hell?* My first instinct was to look up at the ceiling. Nothing. A strong metallic smell made me come to my senses. I brushed my hand against my face. A bright red smudge sat on my palm. I stared at it, alarmed. I\u2019d never gotten nosebleeds before, aside from the time I got hit in the face with a football in high school. My head raised, I scrambled to my feet and made a dash for the bathroom, my hands cupping my throbbing nose.\n\nOnce I had managed to stop the bleeding and cleaned myself up, I returned to the computer.\n\n**4:44 PM: Which part of the brain is responsible for love?**\n\nThis was\u2026 an oddly specific search. I couldn\u2019t recall my wife ever being interested in science or biology. I checked the account logged into the browser, just in case. Perhaps this was someone else\u2019s history altogether? Or maybe we\u2019d been hacked?\n\nNo. Seemed like everything was in order. My wife\u2019s smiling face stared back at me from the login window. What was she doing searching for brain parts anyway?\n\n**4:49 PM: What is excerebration?**\n\nWhat? What was\u2026*excerebration?* Some kind of fancy divorce? I\u2019d never heard of the term in my life. I didn\u2019t even hesitate before clicking it, eager to find out what my wife was planning for us.\n\nI wish I hadn\u2019t.\n\nAs the results came up on the monitor, my stomach lurched and my gag reflex kicked in. The images were graphic enough for my hand to automatically gravitate towards the \u2018return\u2019 button, but a short paragraph in bold caught my eye.\n\n***\u2018An ancient procedure involving chiseling through the bone of the nose, in order to scoop out the brain matter.\u2019***\n\nMy heart hammering in my chest, I clicked the \u2018back\u2019 button and scanned the rest of the entries.\n\n**5:01 PM: Can a person live without the hypothalamus?**\n\n**5:05 PM: Location of the hypothalamus**\n\n**5:11 PM: How much Temazepam is safe?**\n\nMy skin crawled as I read, but I couldn\u2019t look away. I was so immersed that I didn\u2019t even hear the front door bang.\n\n\u201cHoney? I\u2019m home!\u201d\n\nI stared at the wall, too shocked to reply. What was I meant to say? How was I supposed to ask her about all this?\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d she called again, her heels clacking towards me.\n\n\u201cUh, hey!\u201d I choked, throwing the box of tissues into the drawer, \u201cHow was\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, good,\u201d she smiled as she appeared in the doorway, \u201cHow are you? You had quite a lot to drink last night!\u201d\n\n\u201cI-uh\u2026\u201d I stammered, \u201cI did?\u201d\n\nShe studied me, as though she wasn\u2019t sure whether I was joking or not.\n\n\u201cThe\u2026 I\u2026 W-what\u2019s all this?\u201d I asked, gesturing to the computer screen.\n\nShe joined me at the desk, frowning at the clammy wood surface, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nI pointed at the browsing history, my index finger shaking visibly in the air.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d she flushed, two pink spots appearing on her cheeks, \u201cWell, you did say we could try it, so\u2026 I had to do a little research, y\u2019know?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? I said we could try\u2026what?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d she waved her hand dismissively, \u201cThe exce-something.

And then another one. And another. Karen watched me, her skin growing pale, \u201cW-what\u2026\u201d\n\nSuddenly, a small fleshy lump escaped my nostril and rolled down the front of my shirt. We both stared at it in shocked silence. Then, my wife screamed, turning on her heel to flee the room, but I caught up to her, pinning her against the wall.\n\n\u201cTell me what the fuck you did!\u201d\n\nShe tried to fight me, writhing under my grip, but I held on tight. Blood was streaming into my mouth and down my chin, staining both of our clothes.\n\n\u201cH-how can you not remember?\u201d she screeched, trying to elbow me in the ribs, \u201cDon\u2019t you remember what you did?\u201d\n\nI stared at her panic-stricken face, trying my best to recall any memories from the previous night, \u201cNo\u2026what did I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2026you came home after work and told me you were leaving me for Amy,\u201d she sobbed, \u201cYou said you didn\u2019t want to love her, but you did!\u201d\n\nI stood there quietly, mulling it over, as more pulp splashed onto my stomach.\n\n\u201cEw! We need to call you an ambulance!\u201d Karen shrieked, trying to pull away, \u201cWhat the fuck is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what happened?\u201d I demanded, my heart practically leaping out of my chest, \u201cTell me what you did.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck, John?\u201d she screamed, \u201cWe got drunk, okay? We got really wasted! And then you said you knew of a way to fix this! To fix us! You said there\u2019s something called hypothalamus in your brain, and if removed it would stop you from loving Amy\u2026\u201d\n\nI felt like I was having an out-of-body experience. What the hell was she saying? Had she actually attempted to remove a part of my brain? And\u2026\n\n\u201cWait\u2026\u201d I whispered, \u201cWho\u2019s Amy?\u201d\n\nHer expression made me feel foolish for not remembering. I knew that name. *Amy.* It sounded so familiar, and yet I couldn\u2019t for the life of me put my finger on it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2026what the fuck do you mean?\u201d she sounded bewildered, \u201cAmy! The girl you were cheating on me with for six months?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t,\u201d I mouthed, releasing my wife and crumpling to the floor, \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d\n\nKaren stared at me, her white blouse resembling a massacre, her mouth pressed into a thin line.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2026what\u2019s happening to me?\u201d I whispered.\n\nShe was silent for a moment, but I could see her eyes brimming with tears, \u201cHoney\u2026.What if\u2026 What if I\u2026 accidentally hit your hippocampus instead?\u201d\n\n*What?* That told me nothing.\n\n\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, Karen, I\u2019m not a *fucking* encyclopedia!

I just went to university with her, and though she went on to become a professional writer, I most certainly did not. She'll be taking over from me further down but, until then, please forgive my slightly awkward delivery while I give you guys the necessary context. \n\nSecondly, I don't know what you will make of the following events, and I'm sure many of you might consider it all some sort of hoax. I wasn't present for any of what transpired in Phoenix, Arizona but I can vouch for the person who wrote the following logs. She is not, and has never been, a fantasist.\n\nOk so I once knew a girl called Alice Sharma. She was an undergrad at Edinburgh Uni the same time I was. My educational poison was History, a degree which has greatly benefited my career as a bicycle repairman. Alice Sharma studied journalism, though perhaps \"studied\" isn't the word. It's not an exaggeration to say that she lived and breathed the subject. Editor-in-chief of the campus paper, recognisable voice of student radio. She was frustratingly tunnel visioned, and she was a journalist in her own right before anyone gave her a professional shot. \n\nWe met in student halls and became friends almost immediately. A meandering waster trying to stay off his parent's farm and an intrepid, ambitious reporter may not seem the most obvious pairing, but I learned not to question it. She was inspiring, and smart and she proofread all my essays. I\u2019m not too sure what she saw in me.\n\nWe were eventually flatmates down in London where she chased her dream and I chased my tail. She got a few jobs here and there, but nothing befitting of her skills. After months of fruitless internships and rejections, Alice called a flat meeting, telling us that she was moving to America, accepting a position chasing stories for National Public Radio. The job had come out of the blue, the result of a hail mary application she thought had been dismissed out of hand. We threw her a bittersweet going away party and put the room up for rent.\n\nThat party was the last time I saw Alice Sharma. She dropped out of contact a few months after her departure. Complete radio silence. I assumed she was just busy so I carried on with my small but happy life, and waited for her to pop up on television with some important words below her name; Chief Correspondent, Senior Analyst\u2026 something like that.\n\nThe radio silence was broken last week, and, for reasons you\u2019ll glean further down, I\u2019m less happy about it than I would\u2019ve thought.\n\nArriving home from work I found a lone email in my otherwise bare inbox. An email that would later be described as \"suspicious\" by my tech literate friends. Despite being born in the early 1990's I didn't own a computer until uni, and I've missed several important lessons in the world of cyberspace. Lessons like \"Don't call it Cyberspace\" of course and more importantly, \"Don't open emails with no text, no subject and no sender's address.\"\n\nI realise most of you would have deleted this anonymous, blank email immediately, my friends certainly would have, but beyond my basic ignorance about online safety, something further compelled me to open it. The only thing of substance in the entire message was a zipped folder, labeled:\n\nLeft.Right.AS\n\nI don't have to explain what I was hoping those final initials stood for.\n\nOpening the zipped folder I found myself staring at a stack of text files. Each one titled with a date, continuing sequentially from the very earliest file \"07-02-2017\". (To any Americans in the room this is the 7th of February).\n\nI\u2019ve since read the files a few times, and shown them to some friends. They don't know what to make of it either, but they certainly aren't as concerned as me. They think Alice is just in a creative writing phase and, if I didn't know her, I\u2019d have to agree. But the thing is, I do know her.

Every event, his first job, his second wedding, his third divorce, none of them receive more than one or two sentences. Rob plows through the years, the curt, dispassionate curator of his own personal history. Yet the story itself is so fascinating, so rich with moments and so wildly meandering that it somehow stands on its own merits. \n\nIt's a great story, no matter how you tell it.\n\nBy the time Rob was 21, he'd gotten married, had a son, worked as a farmer, a mover, a boat engineer, and grown estranged from his spouse... Here's him talking about that.\n\n**ROB:** Course my wife started to get dissatisfied, I was away a while.\n\n**AS:** For work?\n\n**ROB:**Vietnam.\n\n**AS:** You were in Vietnam? How was that for you?\n\n**ROB:** I ain't never been back since.\n\nThat was everything he had to say concerning his first divorce, and the entire Vietnam war.\n\nRob had four marriages after that, and even more professions. After the war he worked with a firm of private detectives, got shot at once by the mob, then he became a courier, which is how a poor boy from Alabama got to see the world.\n\n**ROB:** I been to most of the continents with that job. I been to India. You from India?\n\n**AS:** My mum and dad are from India yeah.\n\n**ROB:** See I could tell.\n\nHe'd been arrested once in Singapore, after one of his packages had been found to be full of white powder. He spent three days locked up before someone got around to checking the substance. It was chalk. \n\nA friend he made during his brief custody, Hiroji Sato, invited Rob to stay with him in Japan. Just getting over the breakup of his third marriage, Rob took the offer. He stayed in Japan for another 5 years.\n\n**ROB:** The Japanese are good people. Good manners. But they got all these urban legends and ghost stories that Hiroji was crazy for, spent all his free time chasing them down. Like, you heard of Jorogumo?\n\n**AS:** I don't think so\"\n\n**ROB:** Well she's this spider lady lives in the Joro Falls round Izu. Meant to be real pretty but real dangerous. Hiroji took us out there to get a picture of her.\n\n**AS:** Did you ever meet Jorogumo?\n\n**ROB** Nah she didn't show. None of them did. I didn't believe at all until we went to Aokigahara\n\nAokigahara, affectionately titled the Suicide Forest. The next stop on Rob's adventure. It's an area of woodland at the base of Mount Fuji, a notorious hotspot for young people looking to take their own lives. Hiroji, Rob's ghost obsessed jailmate turned best friend, took him to Aokigahara to chase \"yurei\" the ghosts of the forest.\n\n**AS:** Did you find anything? In Aokigahara?\n\n**ROB:** Well I ain't gonna ask you to believe me. But I was a PI. Professional cynic. Even I can't deny there was a spirit in those woods.\n\nFrom that moment on, Rob's sentences start getting longer. A childlike excitement creeps into his voice. I get the distinct feeling we're moving beyond background, beyond Rob Guthard's old life, and towards his new one. The one he wants to talk about. The one that led him to contact the show.\n\n**ROB:** It walked up to me through the trees. Looked like static you see on a TV screen but it had a human shape almost.\n\n**AS:** Almost?\n\n**ROB:** It was missing an arm. It reached out to me but I bolted outta that forest so fast. Hiroji never saw it, holds it against me to this day.\n\nHiroji had good reason to be annoyed. Rob says that Mr Sato had been going to the forest 2-3 times per year for three decades. To have a rookie come along and claim to have seen a yurei on his first trip? I'd be more than a little cranky.\n\nBut Rob didn't stay a rookie for long. In fact, it was in those woods that he discovered his current passion. The supernatural, or more accurately, the documentation and investigation of urban legends. Legends like Bloody Mary, the Jersey Devil, Sasquatch. Rob has looked into them all.\n\n**ROB:** I figured if one was true then who knows how many others could be.\n\n**AS:** How many have you proven so far?\n\n**ROB:** Since Aokigahara? Ain't none of em had any proof to em. Except for one. That's why I called you guys up.\n\nAt this point, Rob can\u2019t hope to repress his smile.\n\nThe Left\/Right game appeared on a paranormal message board in June 2016. Only a few people frequently visited the forum and, of these regulars, only Rob took an interest in the post.\n\n**ROB:** The whole thing had a level of detail you don't see in other stories.\n\n**AS:** What details grabbed your interest?\n\n**ROB:** Logs. High quality pictures. The guy documented everything, said he wasn't gonna play the game anymore. I think he wanted somebody to keep investigating.\n\n**AS:** And you were that somebody.\n\n**ROB:** That's right. I set about trying to verify his information right away.\n\n**AS:** And how did it go?\n\n**ROB:** Well... It didn't take long to realise the Left\/Right Game is the real thing.\n\nThe rules of the Left\/Right game are simple. Get in your car and take a drive. Take a left, then the next possible road on the right, then the next possible left. Repeat the process ad infinitum, until you wind up somewhere... new. The rules are easy to understand, but Rob says their not so easy to follow.\n\n**ROB:** There ain't all that many roads where you can turn left and right and left and right and keep going. Most of the time you find yourself at a dead end or needing to turn in the wrong direction. Phoenix is built on a grid system so you can keep going left and right as long as you need to.\n\n**AS:** Did you move to Phoenix for the Left\/Right game?\n\n**ROB:** That's right.\n\nI try not to seem incredulous. Selling your house in another state, packing up and moving your whole life to Phoenix, Arizona just to play a game you saw on the internet? It seems like insanity. Rob smiles as he reads my expression. I can clearly read his expression too. \"You'll see.\" It says. \"Just wait.\"\n\nI wouldn't have to wait long. Included within the 9 page submission Rob sent our show, was a long list of suggested items the chosen reporter should bring with them. Clothes for three days, a pocket knife, matches, bandages. There were also a set of qualifications the reporter should have. The ability to drive, basic vehicle maintenance and its human equivalent... first aid training. He didn't just want to talk about the Left\/Right Game. He wanted to take one of us along.\n\nRob leaves a short while later to embark on a few errands, \"Prepping the Run\", as he calls it. He shows me to the guest room and we part ways, on good terms but very much aware of the other's poorly veiled opinions. He knew I saw him as a charming obsessive, chasing after a fairy tale. He saw me as a naive cynic, on the cusp of a new world. All I could think as I heard the front door close is that by tomorrow afternoon, one of us would be right.\n\nMore after this.\n\nWhen I wake up the next morning, Rob is in my room, holding a tray which he'd knocked on the bottom of to rouse me. I don't manage to record the start of our conversation.\n\n**ROB:** - I got bananas, strawberries, chocolate syrup. We got some more downstairs but I wanted you to wake up to something good. We won't be eatin' this stuff on the road.\"\n\nRob has made me waffles. He sets them down on the night stand and talks through the coming day as I eat. I'll admit it feels a little uncomfortable, waking up in a stranger's home to find said stranger already standing over me, but I quickly move past it. I tell myself that he\u2019s an older man, accustomed to living alone in his own house, not usually having to think about boundaries. Anyway, he certainly knows his way around a waffle iron.\n\n**ROB:** We hit the road at 9. I wanted to give you time to get ready before everyone shows up.\n\n**AS:** There are other people coming?\n\n**ROB:** We got a 5 car convoy on the road today. They'll be here in an hour.\n\nThis is the first I\u2019ve heard of a convoy, and to be honest I\u2019m surprised. The game is Rob's obsession, and I\u2019m here at his request. The idea that anyone else would have an interest in today's drive is a little perplexing.\n\nHalf an hour later, sated, showered and dressed in the \"functional clothing\" Rob had so painstakingly outlined, I take my pack out to the porch. Rob\u2019s already there, waiting for his associates to show up.\n\n**AS:** I thought you'd be conducting a few more errands.\n\n**ROB:** If you ain't prepared by the morning of, you ain't prepared.\n\n**AS:** Hah ok I guess that's fair. Oh, Rob is the garage locked? The inside door won't budge and I wanted to mic up the car.\n\n**ROB:** Yeah it's locked up I'll open it for ya.\n\n**AS:** Thank you.\n\n**ROB:** In fact it's about time I wheeled her out. Fair warning Ms Sharma, she's a thing of beauty.\n\nTo Rob Guthard, beauty took the form of a dark green Jeep Wrangler. Rob climbs in and lets it roll out of the garage, where it dominates every inch of driveway. The car is large; four doors with a roof enclosing the entire compartment. It\u2019s also been modified extensively, yet another example of Rob's dedication to the game.\n\n**ROB:** What're you thinking?\n\n**AS:** I think you're two caterpillar treads short of driving a tank.\n\n**ROB:** Hah yeah I fixed her up good. I put the winch in, heavy duty tires, the light rig on top is LED's. They'll make midnight look like noon but they don't use hardly any power.\n\n**AS:** Aren't Jeeps open top usually?\n\n**ROB:** Not all. This is the Unlimited. I like to have a covered car when I head on the road.\n\nI climb in and stow my pack. Rob had removed the back seats to afford more storage space. The place is packed to the brim. Jerry cans of gasoline, barrels of water, rope, snacks and his own neatly packed set of clothes.\n\nI wonder if the rest of our convoy would take the game so seriously.\n\n**ROB:** We got Apollo coming up in 10 minutes. No one else has given me a time. I sent the schedule weeks ago, this always happens.\n\n**AS:** His name's Apollo?\n\n**ROB:** That's his call sign. Apollo Creed I think he said.\n\n**AS:** Why are you using call signs?\n\n**ROB:** Did I not tell you? Oh yeah we're gonna use call signs on the road, keep communication clear.\n\n**AS:** What's your callsign?\n\n**ROB:** Ferryman.\n\n**AS:** ... What's my call sign?\n\n**ROB:** I thought about it. I was thinking London, you're from London right?\n\n**AS:** I'm from Bristol.\n\n**ROB:** Bristol? That\u2019s fine I guess.\n\nIt\u2019s less than ten minutes before Apollo turns the corner. Rob jumps out of his chair and paces briskly over to the edge of his property, as his first guest pulls up and steps onto the sidewalk.\n\nApollo vaguely resembles his namesake, dark skinned, tall and noticeably well built, though it\u2019s clear he couldn\u2019t be less of a fighter. This Apollo Creed is all smiles and seems to have a penchant for laughing at his own jokes.\n\n**AS:** How far have you come?\n\n**APOLLO:** I've come out of Chicago. Took three days hard driving.\n\n**AS:** And you know Rob from the forums?\n\n**APOLLO:** Everybody knows Rob, Rob's the god! Ahaha\n\nRob walks over to Apollo's car, gesturing him over to talk shop. Rob\u2019s clearly impressed with Apollo's choice of vehicle, a blue Range Rover packed to the ceiling with kit. I was more impressed with Rob himself. Somehow this 65 year old farmer's son had become respected in a vast online community. My dad is Rob\u2019s age and he's just discovered copy and paste.\n\nThe rest don't take long to arrive. Two Minnesotan librarians, also around Rob's age, pull up in a grey Ford Focus. They\u2019re brother and sister, and they've shared ghost hunting as a hobby their entire lives. I find it hard to suppress a smile when they meekly introduce themselves as Bonnie and Clyde.\n\n**CLYDE:** We would have gotten here sooner we had to drop by to get some blankets. Pleasure to meet you ma'am.\n\n**AS:** Pleasure to meet you too.\n\n**CLYDE:** Would you be the journalist?\n\n**AS:** That's right.\n\n**CLYDE:** You used to write for the town paper didn't you?\n\nHe's talking to his sister there, she nods. Clyde is clearly the spokesperson for the pair, yet they both seem incredibly shy. Whether they admire the famous outlaws, or just the name, it's pretty clear they couldn't be more different from the real thing.\n\nNext to show up are Lilith and Eve, English Lit students at New York University and proprietors of the YouTube channel Paranormicon. Unlike Bonnie and Clyde, Lilith and Eve have no issue holding a conversation. As soon as they learn who I am, and what I do for a living, they attempt to conscript me for an expedition to Roswell.\n\n**LILITH:** We have a friend there, he's been seeing some-\n\n**EVE:** -He's a seismologist\n\n**LILITH:** Yeah and he's been recording readings over the years that show subterranean movement. Predictable movement.\n\n**EVE:** We're going to see him in July, but we could work it around you if you're free.\n\n**AS:** I'll have to check my schedule\n\n**EVE:** OK cool let me give you my email...\n\nThey quickly hurry off to film an intro for their latest video, featuring a quick interview with Rob, who seems pretty welcoming of the attention.\n\nThe last two cars arrive within a few seconds of each other. A lithe, strong willed older lady who goes by Bluejay and a younger man going by the callsign \u201cAce\u201d. Bluejay has arrived in a grey Ford Explorer. Ace, much to Rob's annoyance, has arrived in a Porsche.\n\n**ROB:** Did you think that's gonna help on the road? I didn't write that-\n\n**ACE:** It's my car. What am I meant to do,? It's my car.\n\n**ROB:** You didn't read my itinerary, you got nothing packed in there.\n\n**ACE:** I did read it sir OK? Calm down. I have a bag, I won't ask you for anything.\n\n**ROB:** Well I know that's true.\n\nAce and Rob were off to a bad start. Ace takes a phone call, and despite my best efforts to get an interview with Bluejay, she doesn't seem interested in talking to a journalist.\n\nWith five cars, and seven travellers waiting for a green light, Rob hands out radios and charging packs, then launches into a quick safety briefing. Wear seatbelts. Stay in position. Communicate clearly and often. It\u2019s at this moment I start to feel a little dismay. I like Rob, and clearly so does everyone else. He'd convinced all of them to drive across the country to join in with his game. I start to worry what will happen in the likely event that the whole thing isn\u2019t real. Would Rob lose the respect of his peers? Would he accept failure when it comes? After seeing the effort he\u2019s put into these runs, the next few hours have the potential to be wildly uncomfortable.\n\nWith a smile and a few encouraging words, Rob ends his briefing and beckons me over to the Wrangler. I clamber inside and make myself as comfortable as possible.\n\n**ROB:** You ready for this Bristol?\n\n**AS:** I'm ready.\n\n**ROB:** Ok then let's hit the road.\n\nThe Wrangler pulls out of the driveway, and the convoy follows in order of arrival. Apollo, Bonnie & Clyde, Lilith & Eve, Bluejay and Ace keep a steady pace behind us as we come up to the first corner.\n\nRob slowly and deliberately turns left, checking on the others in his rear view mirror. He looks back to the road as Ace\u2019s Porsche completes the first turn of the game. Shortly afterwards, Apollo checks in on the CB radio.\n\n**APOLLO:** This is Apollo for Ferryman. How many to more go Rob? ahahaha\n\n**ROB:** Hah as many as it takes.\n\nI can tell Rob wanted the to reserve the radio for something other than Apollo's quips. But he seems to like Apollo enough to let it slide. I'm not sure Ace would have received the same treatment. We take the next right, then another left. Now safely assured that everyone's following correctly, Rob speaks my thoughts aloud.\n\n**ROB:** You're wondering the same thing Apollo is.\n\n**AS:** What do you mean?\n\n**ROB:** You're wondering how many turns we're gonna take before we hit some wall or something. Before you find out this is all just a story.\n\n**AS:** Does that disappoint you?\n\n**ROB:** I'd be disappointed if you weren't thinking something like it. But now we're on the road I gotta say something and you gotta listen to it.\n\n**AS:** OK...\n\n**ROB:** We're coming up to a tunnel soon. Any time before we reach it you can get out, walk in any direction you like, and you won\u2019t be in the game no more. Once we go through, you gotta retrace the route we took to get yourself back out that tunnel. That's when you\u2019re home. And you gotta convince someone to take you back in a car coz I ain't ferrying you back 20 minutes in. You got till the tunnel to skip out on this, understand?\n\n**AS:** I understand. Though I have to say I'm getting little nervous.\n\n**ROB:** Ain't nothing wrong with a little nervous.\n\nWe've taken 23 turns by this point. Already I feel like we're traversing the city pretty effectively. Rob's heavily modified Wrangler solicits a few impressed glances from passersby, as well as several honks of respect from other Jeep drivers. Other than those few moments, everything seems completely indistinguishable from a regular morning drive. I even start to worry if there\u2019ll be anything at all for this story. \u201cReporter Takes Drive With Interesting Man\u201d isn\u2019t exactly Pulitzer worthy.\n\nTurn 33 leads us onto a short, unassuming street. A row of small businesses in a quiet Phoenician neighbourhood; liquor, second hand clothing, tools and, at the end of the street, a little shop selling antique mirrors. Ten or so people shuffle along the sidewalk, smiling, talking, planning their weekends. The only lone person is a young woman in a grey coat..\n\nI briefly glimpse her at the end of the street, standing on our next corner, the back of her coat reflected in fifty old mirrors. Even from a distance I can see that she\u2019s sullen, wide eyed and nervous. She shifts constantly on her feet, tugging at the button of her coat.\n\nI look away to write some notes as we roll down the street. When I look up again, the woman is standing by my window, staring right at me. She\u2019s smiling, a wide, unfaltering grin that seems almost offensive in its complete insincerity.\n\n**GREYWOMAN:** Lambs at the gate. Hoping for something better than clover when all they find are things worse than slaughter.\n\n**AS:** Rob what's happening?\n\n**ROB:** Ignore her.\n\n**GREYWOMAN:** He wanted to leave me so I cut him out. The lake was hungry it drank the wound clean.\n\n**AS:** Miss, are you alright?\n\nThe smile vanishes, it snaps from her face and suddenly, the woman is furious.\n\n**GREYWOMAN:** What do you think you're doing?! Have you gone mad?!\n\nI reflexively press myself back in my chair as the woman, wild eyed and gaunt, slams her fists against my window, with every intent of breaking through.\n\n**GREYWOMAN:** Would you dance down the lion\u2019s tongue? It will shred you, you whore! It will shred you down to your sins! You fucking bastard!\n\nRob puts his foot down, and the Wrangler rolls defiantly away from the woman. As we turn the corner I watch her as she wretches, her every movement cradled in abject hysteria. She yells despairingly at the rest of the convoy, bursting into tears when the last car passes her by. \n\nAs she shrinks into the rear view mirror, I see her turn to a large mirror on the side of the shop, which the owner is in the process of polishing. I watch as she walks up to it, and with a convulsant scream, slams her head into the glass.\n\nThe mirror cracks around her forehead, the owner jumps back in shock, and as the woman pulls her head from the mirror's surface, the fractured spider\u2019s web is dripping red. It all happens in a split second, and she quickly swerves from my view as we take the next left.\n\n**AS:** Rob, what was that?\n\n**ROB:** She's there sometimes.\n\n**AS:** On that street?\n\n**ROB:** On the 34th turn.\n\n**AS:** Who is she?\n\n**ROB:** I don't know. She's never acted out that much before though. Must be a special trip.\n\nI find Rob's lack of concern a little unpleasant, and his implication that this woman's ravings were the symptom of an internet game leaves me more than a little perturbed. As I see it, there are a few explanations for what just happened, and none of them lead to a comforting conclusion.\n\nIf we had just encountered a bonafide crazy person, then one could argue that Rob is just seeing what he wants to see. Maybe he'd bought into the game\u2019s story so much that every strange but explainable occurrence would be rationalised as the next step in his favourite paranormal narrative.\n\nAlternatively, the woman could have been an actor, a more elaborate theory sure, but not unheard of. People have lied to the show before and Rob was receiving a tonne of publicity for this attempt from Lilith, Eve and I. I admit, Rob didn't seem like a liar, but good liars never do.\n\nThere is a third alternative however. An alternative which, if you put logic aside, explains the all troubling little details that I couldn't help but notice. Because as strange as the grey woman was, isn't it stranger that no one on the street would react? I couldn't recall a single glance in her direction by anybody on the sidewalk. Perhaps that theory falls apart when you consider the shock on the mirror seller's face but, when I think about it, he only reacted once the mirror shattered, and even then, I feel like his attention was on the mirror itself.\n\nThe radio crackles.\n\n**LILITH:** Lillith to Bristol. Sara... Eve got that on camera! Do you have audio?\n\n**AS:** I think it picked her up.\n\n**LILITH:** My god that was so weird. Can you send us the file when we stop? Can you ask Ferryman when we're stopping?\n\n**AS:** When's our stopping point?\n\n**ROB:** For them, in about 30 minutes. For you? Well, you tell me.\n\nRob turns off a busy street just before a large intersection, onto a much quieter stretch of two lane road. Ahead of us the road slopes downward, leading into an underpass, which disappears into darkness.\n\nWe'd arrived at the tunnel.\n\n**AS:** What is this supposed to pass under?\n\n**ROB:** Ain't supposed to pass under anything, it's just there.\n\n**AS:** And if we weren't playing the game?\n\n**ROB:** Then it won't show. The question is, are you playing the game or not?\n\nRob turns to me. It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s taken his eyes off the road since we started. He pulls the car to a slow stop at the mouth of the tunnel.\n\n**ROB:** You get out now you can go wherever you wanna go, but through there you'll need a car to get yourself home and, like I said, mine ain't turnin round for a long while. You understand?\n\nIt\u2019s a dramatic statement, but unsettlingly, it doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s attempting to dramatise. It feels like I\u2019m having something genuinely asked of me. Am I ready for what\u2019s to come? Do I accept the risks involved? Do I consent to be taken down this road, and the next road, and the next? Am I prepared to see this game through, real or otherwise, to its end?\n\n**AS:** What are you waiting for?\n\nRob smiles, and turns back to the road. He picks up the CB radio holds down the button on the side. The microphone crackles.\n\n**ROB:** This is Ferryman to all cars. Anyone want to step out then pull to the side now. Otherwise, stay in formation and have some supplies at hand. We got a long ways to go.\n\nMuch like the game I\u2019m so tentatively playing, my view of Robert J. Guthard seems to change direction frequently. I\u2019d heard all about his life, but I\u2019m sure that I know him. I like the guy, but I\u2019m not certain that I trust him. And though I admire his dedication to the Left\/Right Game, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll like where it might lead us. Yet as he takes us into the tunnel, his face vanishing and reappearing under the dim sodium lights, I can that tell he expects this trip to be a major step in his already impressive story, and this time, for better or for worse, I\u2019m along for the ride."},"240":{"title":"The previous tenant of my new flat left a survival guide.

I\u2019m so stressed and I\u2019ve barely slept since I discovered that Jamie was missing. It\u2019s starting to make me feel a little twitchy. But I thought I\u2019d better update you guys. \n\nI was overwhelmed by all the suggestions you gave me and have taken more than a few of them on board. I\u2019m definitely going to be getting a huge planter full of sage for the balcony and I did spill a little salt in my doorway. I\u2019m sorry to disappoint but that didn\u2019t help at all. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing I\u2019m following quite like Mrs Hemming\u2019s rules. I\u2019ve followed them to the letter so far, and lo and behold I\u2019m still alive. That\u2019s not to say it hasn\u2019t been tough. Il start from the beginning. \n\n\n\n\nI was going crazy. And a few hours after my last post Jamie still hadn\u2019t returned. He had been gone for almost 24 hours. His work have called me multiple times. I don\u2019t know what to say so I just keep ghosting the calls. \n\nI was bang in the middle of the danger time when I decided checking the lift had to be my first step. But I wasn\u2019t going to break that rule. \n\nI waited. I waited desperately for 3.34 to come and I\u2019m ashamed to say that when it did I remained paralysed to our sofa for almost half an hour before I found the nerve to leave the flat. It was 4.02 when I finally reached the lift. \n\nThe lift in this building is old and rickety. It hasn\u2019t been updated in a very long time and has likely been here as long as the building. It\u2019s big, clunky buttons stared back at me as I glared at them, hoping for some sort of answer or clue. My heart thumped and I was overcome with a feeling of dread but nothing came of any of it. It was hopeless. \n\nI stepped inside the lift, rode it up and down a few floors and searched the entire perimeter with a phone torch for anything I could find. I found nothing. Jamie had completely disappeared. \n\nSobbing and exhausted I rode back to floor 7 and turned my key in flat 42, the perfect home that felt anything but home at that point. \n\nI sat at the cheap flat pack dining table we\u2019d managed to put together on move-in day and cried. My hands shaking as I held my phone. \n\nI was flitting between reading all your comments and contemplating calling the police for an hour. But I decided to call my friend Georgia instead. I needed a real person here, things were so crazy I wasn\u2019t sure the police would be able to help with what little information I had. But I knew I needed to sound it out with someone.\n\nIl spare you the details again, but I told her everything. She promised she\u2019d be with me in the late morning, she had to take her younger brother to school. \n\nI waited anxiously. Not before arming every room exactly as advised. Before I knew it I looked at the clock and it was 8.23, I had around half an hour until the postman was due to show up. \n\nThere was no way I was missing him today. I stood by the door looking vacantly at the wood, like someone in a film who was possessed. The exhaustion was really setting in but Jamie was all I could think of. Pure adrenaline was keeping me standing. \n\nAt 8.52 I opened the door. The next two minutes were the longest of my life but when I saw him a wave of relief swept my entire body. \n\nRight on cue, 8.54 the postman, Ian Flanders stood in front of me, a smile that barely hid his concern covering his younger than expected face. He didn\u2019t look old enough to have been the postman for over 35 years but I was too  distracted by the answers that I needed from him to care.\n\n\u201cYou must be the new tenant.\u201d He stated, but in a way that it sounded like a question. I struggled with my answer, so I got straight to the point.\n\n\u201cMrs Hemmings left me a note, she said to speak to you if - \u201c\n\n\u201cCan I come in dear? I think we need to chat.\u201d\n\nI ushered Ian in, my hands still shaking as I flapped them in the direction of the sofa, gesturing for him to sit down. I shoved the now slightly crumpled note into his lap and waited. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad Prue still thinks that highly of me. I will miss that old girl.\u201d He said with a coy smile as he reached the end of the note. \n\n\u201cCan you help me or not?\u201d I had no time for his ego trip over a moved on neighbour. \n\n\u201cI can help. But I can\u2019t stop for long so it\u2019ll have to be quick. I\u2019ve walked these halls delivering the post for 40 years. I\u2019ve seen it all, everything Prue\u2019s mentioned and more. What do you need to know?\u201d He said.\n\nIan was nothing like what I expected. The note made me feel like he was going to be a kindly, old grandad type figure, but I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. Postman Ian spoke with a thick city accent, and wore a heavy gold chain around his tattooed neck. He had dyed his greying hair boot polish black.\n\nHis demeanour was thankfully non threatening but extraordinarily cocky. He was the sort of man I imagined in a betting shop, rubbing his grubby hands on notes as he bragged over a win. \n\nHe didn\u2019t ask as he lit a cigarette in my living room. I didn\u2019t question it, we would usually smoke outside but I wasn\u2019t going to argue over technicalities. I grabbed a bowl for the ash and lit one too. \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s start with the things in the lift. My boyfriend is missing and he took the lift at quarter past 3 over 24 hours ago. We hadn\u2019t got this note yet. I haven\u2019t heard from him since. I need to get him back.\u201d I barked at him as if the louder I spoke the more I could influence his answer. But nothing prepared me for what he said. \n\nHis skin turned pale and his harsh looking face became more sympathetic as he explained. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead, love. Forget about him now. Only one person has ever come back from the lift at that time of night and it was Prue herself. After witnessing it. Those creatures ripping their victim apart. Poor Prue was traumatised. Your boy is gone, let go and follow the rules.\u201d He was blunt but I could tell he felt sorry for me. \n\n\u201cThere must be something I can do!\u201d I pleaded.\n\n\u201cThere are things I\u2019ve heard to bring back those who are lost but I\u2019ve never seen solid proof they work. It would be irresponsible of me to tell you to do something that might get you killed too. It\u2019s nice here, honest, just get over him and live the status quo. Sorry if I sound harsh, I don\u2019t mean to, but you seem like a decent young lady and I don\u2019t want to see you go too soon.\u201d\n\nI asked about what Mrs Hemmings had seen in the lift and if they were sure it happened to all who entered it. I refused to believe that Jamie was dead. There had to be something I could do and if I knew what I was dealing with I could be better prepared. \n\n\u201cIt was awful what happened. I wasn\u2019t there, but this is what I was told. \n\nLittle Lyla was such a cute kid. She used to open the door and give me a tip when I delivered the post. She was Prue\u2019s granddaughter. Lyla was her sons little girl and that night She was staying over for the first time. Prue finally felt confident that she could protect Lyla from all the strange things that happen here...\n\nShe was wrong. Little Lyla had a problem with sleepwalking. And she took a trip into the hallway at half 1 in the morning, Prue took a little too long to notice the sound she had heard was the front door and by the time she reached the lift she saw the creatures dragging Lyla\u2019s limbs away from her body. She tried to fight them, even killed one, but she couldn\u2019t save the little girl.\u201d \n\nI was hysterical, imagining Jamie\u2019s fate.\n\n\u201cWhat are the creatures? Have you ever actually seen them.\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNo one really knows what they are love. They\u2019re something to do with the building and all its quirks, no ones ever seen them elsewhere. We don\u2019t know where they came from, just that they\u2019re here. \n\nI\u2019ve seen them a few times over the years, usually when new neighbours have left biscuits down for their cats and dogs or haven\u2019t disposed of food waste properly. \n\nThey\u2019re curious little creatures. Mostly harmless out of the hours Prue warned you about, but if they\u2019re fed they can become quite viscous looking for more food. \n\nThat\u2019s why you have to bin all your scraps, or hide them or pack them or whatever. Just don\u2019t leave them out and don\u2019t use the lift at those times and you\u2019re safe from the creatures. \n\nThey\u2019re a little smaller than humans, but they\u2019re a similar shape, they come with grotesque rodent like features, and are far larger than any rodent could be. Like rodent children I suppose. They have two sharp rows of teeth per jaw and are consistently hungry. \n\nWhen they eat they crunch down in a violent and disgusting way, dripping spittle everywhere, Prue said she could hear her granddaughters bones shatter in those jaws.\u201d He went pale at the thought of that, but continued.\n\n\u201cWhen they first arrived in the building there were hundreds, it caused pandemonium amongst the residents. We lost the residents of more than 30 of the individual homes. But the residents fought back and managed to kill all but the strongest minority of them. \n\nThe creatures left over were incredibly dangerous and seemingly impossible to eradicate, so the residents struck a deal. A deal that they will be left unharmed and allowed to live in the building in return for the residents safety at all times, but if anyone wanders into the lift between 1.11 and 3.33am they are fair game. \n\nThis timeframe is the period the creatures are at their most frenzied and restricting them to the lift was safer for all parties. God help anyone who encounters them during those hours.\n\nThey\u2019ve been here ever since, claimed lots of unsuspecting people avoiding the stairs, but nothing like when they first arrived. A few got put down for not holding up their end of the bargain but we haven\u2019t had an incident outside the lift in years. Count yourself lucky you missed that crisis. \n\nEverything here\u2019s pretty peaceful right now. I\u2019m sorry about your boyfriend. I really have to go, I\u2019m late for my round.\u201d He scrawled his phone number on a bit of paper and handed it to me. \u201cEmergencies only, I don\u2019t like to be bothered.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go! The note said you would help me!\u201d I exclaimed.\n\n\u201cAnd I will!\u201d He snapped back, \u201cwhen there\u2019s something I can help with. I can\u2019t resurrect your boyfriend and I don\u2019t like to be late delivering the post. I will see you soon love.\u201d\n\nI was in shock, I couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing, and I couldn\u2019t believe he was leaving me after the information overload and the small ray of hope he had lit inside me and then squashed. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll call the police!\u201d I shouted, desperate to feel as if I was solving this somehow.\n\n\u201cYou can try if you want.\u201d Ian sighed, as he opened the door to leave. \u201cIt just aggravates the creatures, and it isn\u2019t going to bring your boy back. Mr prentice hates it when police come too, if you want to get any sleep in the next week then I\u2019d avoid it. Wait a week, report him missing and learn to adapt to life here love, or you\u2019ll be dead in days.\u201d\n\nAnd with that he shut the door behind him. I opened it again, I had so much more to ask, but he was gone, no sign of him anywhere in the corridor. \n\nMaybe it was me losing my mind, I might be imagining all these things. But no matter how much I willed it the note was still there. And Jamie still wasn\u2019t.\n\n\n\n\nGeorgia arrived not long after Ian had left. I, of course, asked if she had seen him in the corridor, to try and affirm to myself that he was real, but she hadn\u2019t. She looked at me worried, and held me as I sobbed and told her what the postman had said about Jamie and the creatures. \n\nI wasn\u2019t sure she believed me. Even as she read the note she looked skeptical. If she was skeptical I wouldn\u2019t have blamed her, but she had always been supportive. She sat with me for hours while I just sobbed, heartbroken. I was so conflicted as to what do to. It felt insane that I hadn\u2019t contacted anybody, but this note had turned out to be accurate so far and if the postman was to be trusted then I should wait. \n\nGeorgia had been my best friend for many years, she stuck up for me when I was too scared to do it for myself and had always been the brave one of the two of us. I felt safe around her, so after hours of crying and despairing at the way my life had changed in a matter of days I finally decided to take a nap. It was early evening and Georgia was watching some tv. Just there for me if I needed her.\n\nDespite the deprivation, I struggled to fall asleep, I tried to imagine Jamie\u2019s arms around me but it became a more painful reminder that they probably never will be again. Eventually, after what felt like an eternity of staring at the damp patch on ceiling I drifted off. \n\nAbout three hours ago, I woke up, staring at the goddamn damp patch on the ceiling and could hear chatting in the living room. I jumped out of bed and walked towards it.\n\nGeorgia was on the sofa, with a middle aged looking woman, both nursing a cup of tea in the matching mugs that Jamie had got me as a move in present. My blood boiled but it wasn\u2019t their fault, I cleared my throat to get their attention. \n\n\u201cOh Katie! This is Natalia, she lives upstairs. We got chatting so I made her a cup of tea. I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d I looked at the dark haired woman on the sofa, drinking tea from my cup and nodded. Georgia was a sociable idiot with no understanding of when to not be herself. I wasn\u2019t going to lament her for it right now. It was her coping. \n\n\u201cOf course. Hi Natalia, what flat do you live in?\u201d I tried my very best to be polite. I would have to discuss not bringing people into my home mid tragedy with Georgia after she had left but until then I would be neighbourly.\n\n\u201cFlat 71. It\u2019s so nice to meet you, you have a lovely home.\u201d Natalia responded, her lips curled at the corners into a smile that wasn\u2019t replicated in her eyes or the rest of her facial expression. She looked at me smugly, with full knowledge that I was aware of the implications of what she had just said.\n\nThe rules...\n\nThe flat number....\n\n*every now and again someone will knock at your door claiming to live in one of these flats and ask to borrow some sugar. They will seem entirely average but you must shut and lock the door immediately. I installed two extra security bolts to avoid these fuckers. I don\u2019t like to swear at my age but they really are fuckers.*\n\nPrue\u2019s warning echoed in my mind and I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off Natalia. Something really was off about her. I looked at Georgia sat on the sofa next to her and noticed her sweating. Anyone in the uk knows that it\u2019s been a hot for few days but this was beyond just the ambient temperature. Her entire body was dripping. \n\nSuddenly, she began to pant. Natalia\u2019s eyes were locked to mine just like the window cleaners had been. Nothing happened before with the cleaner, except this time the rule had been broken. She was already in the flat. \n\nGeorgia started to scream as her skin blistered and charred. Her hair fell from her scalp as the skin flaked and melted away from every inch of her. She was being burned alive without a flame in sight. She scratched frantically at her own melting face, digging into the exposed raw flesh. The sound a person makes when they burn alive is like no other. That will never leave me. \n\nI screamed and screamed but no one came to my door. I tried to grab my phone to call postman Ian but the wooden surface I had set it down on burned my fingers to the touch and forced me to recoil. She was going to set the whole flat alight. \n\nMy actions needed to be quicker than a phone call. \n\nI grabbed hold of the large knife I had set down on the side earlier when weaponising, the handle blistered my fingers instantly but I didn\u2019t care, I needed to get her out now and help Georgia if I could. I ran towards the dark haired lady, sweat dripping from my brow the closer I got and plunged the knife into Natalia\u2019s throat. She gripped it and fell to the floor. \n\nShe didn\u2019t bleed like a normal human. Her insides were black, she was still moving, and I figured it probably wouldn\u2019t be long before she stood right back up and tried again. So I dragged her into the hallway ready to bolt the door. \n\nAs we reached the entrance of the corridor one of the cats was waiting, hissing at her semi conscious body, I caught her eyes fixate on it as I dumped her on the floor. I grabbed the cat, pulled him inside, wincing as it\u2019s skin caused more burns up my lower arms, shut the door and watched through the peep hole. She got up and held her hand to the wound, cauterising it and walking off towards the lift. As if she hadn\u2019t been injured at all. \n\nI\u2019d dropped the cat by that point but every bit of naked skin it had touched throbbed and burned for at least an hour. \n\nGeorgia hadn\u2019t been as lucky as Natalia with injury recovery. I anonymously called an ambulance for her. I couldn\u2019t believe it but she was still breathing. She was badly burned and her life wouldn\u2019t be the same again but she was alive. And for that I was grateful. \n\nIt sounds awful but I left her at the park across the road from the building. With no phone or i.d. She\u2019s my best friend and I want to be there but if I own up to involvement in injuries that bad they\u2019ll suspect me, and I lose the already slim chance that Jamie might be saveable. It doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t care about Georgia, but she\u2019s alive. I won\u2019t believe Jamie isn\u2019t until I see it. \n\nSo now I\u2019m alone again, in the flat, conflicted about what to do. \n\nI want to leave. So badly. But this was mine and Jamie\u2019s first home together. If he\u2019s alive, and I can save him then I want it to be here for him to come back to... and if he\u2019s dead, and the postman is right then I don\u2019t know if I can leave his memory behind. \n\nThere\u2019s only one person I think could help me right now. So tonight I\u2019m going to do some research, hunt down an address and tomorrow morning I\u2019m going to visit Prudence Hemmings.\n\nHow it went: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/cj2g4k\/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app"},"241":{"title":"Dad shut himself inside his bunker at the start of the pandemic. Three months ago, we lost contact with him.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/ohf4uk\/dad_shut_himself_inside_his_bunker_at_the_start\/","flair":null,"author":"Odd_directions","selftext":"Dad shut himself inside his bunker at the beginning of 2020. He said the world was about to end and when we didn\u2019t believe him, he told us to wake up. It was raining that day. I remember focusing on the water hitting the windowpanes while my sister tried to change Dad\u2019s mind. I knew it was no use. He was too stubborn to listen to anyone except maybe Donald Trump. WHO had just declared that COVID-19 had pushed the world into a pandemic. Dad wanted us to join him and when we told him no, he called us brainwashed.\n\nHe purchased the land before I was born. Only because of the dilapidated military facility that came with it. It was abandoned sometime in the 60s, I think. My sister was there from the beginning, even before Dad\u2019s obsession pushed Mom away. It\u2019s hard for me to imagine what he was like back then. Mom says he was a gentleman. But they married young, and a person can change a lot during those years. And so did Dad. All I remember from him during childhood are the weekends at the bunker. Constantly renovating it and stockpiling it with everything he would need to survive down there.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t stop him. He wasn\u2019t the best Dad, not even a good one, but it was sad to see him go all the same. He was excited, even though he thought that civilization was about to collapse. I guess that happens when you\u2019ve spent your entire adult life preparing. We had to set up an old radio to keep in touch with him. He didn\u2019t trust mobile phones. We didn\u2019t hear from him often, just once a month, sometimes less. The last time he radioed in, he said he had found a hidden door. He was going to see where it went. That was three months ago.\n\n\u201cYou think he\u2019s okay?\u201d my sister said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t in great health. I *told* him.\u201d\n\nWe sat in the car, on our way to check up on him, driving through the heatwave.\n\n\u201cHis radio might have broken down,\u201d I said. \u201cLet\u2019s not assume the worst.\u201d\n\nBut I felt worried too. There was something strange about that hidden door, and his tone when he mentioned it. It didn\u2019t sit right with me. But maybe it was just the heat and the endless desert around us that played tricks on my mind. I couldn\u2019t really tell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was dark when we arrived. Dad\u2019s truck stood where he had left it, beneath some tarp that blew in the chilly, sand-carrying wind. We turned on our flashlights and walked to the cliff above the bunker. The steel door was made to withstand a nuclear blast. Luckily, I owned the only spare key in existence. Before I used it, I banged on the door as hard as I could and yelled for Dad. I worried he would mistake us for intruders and shoot us. If he was confused, and if it was dark, it was a real possibility. I banged again and yelled at the top of my lungs:\n\n\u201cDad, are you there? It\u2019s me, Josh! Eveline is here as well!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he can hear you,\u201d Eveline said.\n\nI nodded. \u201cDad! I\u2019m going to open the door now!\u201d\n\nI was seventeen the last time I was here. Back then it was the Muslims that were going to end civilization as we knew it. Before that, it was the Russians. Now it was China. There was always something threatening his beloved freedom, and yet he was never truly free. My sister put her hand on my wrist just as I was about to unlock the door.\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe we should just call the authorities after all and\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cHe\u2019ll fight them.\u201d\n\nI unlocked the heavy door. A rancid smell escaped the darkness inside. It was the odor of death. I recognized it from when Dad tried\u2013\u2013and ultimately failed\u2013\u2013to learn how to hunt and let a reindeer carcass rot on the property for weeks. My sister had already stopped visiting him by then. I didn\u2019t tell her what the smell reminded me of. She covered her nose with her shirt. We descended the spiral stairs. It creaked for each step we took, almost as if it was about to fall apart.\n\nI tried the light switch at the bottom. The click echoed throughout the long corridor leading to the living area. Nothing happened.\n\n\u201cHm.\u201d I realized that the batteries, which he charged by the use of an old exercise bike, were dead. That meant he was most likely dead as well. \u201cThe generator could be broken,\u201d I said. \u201cBut\u2026 Maybe you should wait back here, just in case\u2026 you know.\u201d\n\nI pointed my flashlight in front of me. The light was too weak to reach the end of the corridor. On the way here I had felt ready. I felt sad, the kind of empty sadness you feel after the death of a parent that was never any good, but I didn\u2019t feel worried. Now, on the other hand, while staring into the dark corridor that I used to run through as a kid\u2026 I was afraid. The fear reminded me of how my childhood night terrors used to start. They always crept up on me in the darkness, grew with the grotesque shadows on my bedroom ceiling.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not letting you go in there alone,\u201d Eveline said. \u201cWe stay together.\u201d\n\nWe walked into the darkness. The foul smell intensified for every step we took, and so did my heartbeat. I was glad my sister didn\u2019t stay behind. The bunker seemed so much smaller than I remembered it, much more cramped. The asymmetry between my memories and reality made everything feel off somehow, just as if the bunker was merely a model of the real thing. But it wasn\u2019t. I had just grown up.\n\nThe Confederate flag greeted us at the end of the corridor. It hung on the concrete wall. It looked pale in the hotspot of the flashlight, almost like a phantom. And, of course, in many ways it was. A ghost from a time long ago. Or perhaps a corpse brought back to life. An abomination. It reminded me of Dad more than anything else.\n\n\u201cYou have to be seriously confused to praise freedom as much as Dad and hang that symbol of lesser freedom in the world on your wall,\u201d Eveline said.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to protect his freedom so much that he built a prison for himself.\u201d I removed the light from the flag, leaving only darkness. \u201cYou bet he was confused.\u201d\n\nWe entered the main chamber. It was overfilled with litter and clutter. Empty cans\u2013\u2013both the food and beer kinds\u2013\u2013lay scattered across the sticky floor. We had to take large steps not to step on any of the trash.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s weird.\u201d Eveline pointed her flashlight at the small dining table. \u201cLook.\u201d\n\nMy hair stood up on my neck before I even realized what she meant. The table was set for three people. I didn\u2019t say anything for a moment, trying to process what I was seeing, and just when I was about to speak my sister interrupted me:\n\n\u201cWho the *fuck* was here with him?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know\u2013\u201d I began. \u201cI mean, he might have left the old plates on the table and\u2013\u201d\n\nA sound of something falling to the ground came from one of the other rooms further into the bunker. I pointed my light in its direction but couldn\u2019t see what made it.\n\n\u201cDad!\u201d I yelled. \u201cIt\u2019s me, Josh! You there?\u201d\n\nNo response.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid,\u201d Eveline whispered. \u201cSomething isn\u2019t right.\u201d\n\nI only vaguely heard what she said. My focus was on something else. Something on the wall on the other end of the room.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not supposed to be there.\u201d I slowly walked toward it. \u201cThat must have been what he talked about over the radio.\u201d\n\nDad had hacked away a layer of concrete, for whatever reason, and uncovered a rusty, metal door behind it. It stood ajar. A lukewarm, musty breeze came out of it. My sister walked up to me as I carefully pried the door open with the back of my flashlight. I felt my heart in my throat. I could hear my sister begging for us to leave, almost in tears. But I needed to know what was behind that door. It was imperative to understand what had happened here. I needed to know. I needed closure.\n\n\u201cWhat in heavens name\u2026\u201d Eveline looked over my shoulder. \u201cWhy is this here?\u201d\n\nBehind the door was a room about the size of a broom cupboard. It was unremarkable except for a circular hole in the middle of the floor. I shone my light into it, but I couldn\u2019t see the bottom. Just as I thought it was big enough for a person, my sister said:\n\n\u201cDo you think he fell?\u201d\n\nDrops of sweat from my forehead fell down the pit. I felt dizzy and stepped back, afraid I would fall inside. My sister picked up a can filled with some rotten beans and threw it down the hole. It clattered against the walls as it bounced from one side to another. The sound faded away until we couldn\u2019t hear it anymore. There was no indication it touched down at the bottom. I stretched out my hand and held it above the opening.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s warm,\u201d I said. \u201cThe air, I mean.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe he fell.\u201d Eveline stepped back, almost as if she were convinced. \u201cCan we please get out of here?\u201d She reached for my arm. \u201cWe can return with the police. Please\u2026 Josh?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t dark when Dad found this,\u201d I said. \u201cHe would have seen the hole.\u201d\n\n\u201cJosh? Please.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust give me a moment to think.\u201d I walked toward the hallway that led to the other rooms, desperately hoping to find him. For some reason, it was important for me to see him. To be able to leave without wondering. I needed to know that he was truly dead. \u201cI just want to\u2013\u201d I stopped myself after I accidentally pointed the flashlight on the floor in the middle of the hallway, revealing a pair of feet. \u201cI think I found him!\u201d I ran up to the body.\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d Eveline yelled and reluctantly followed me to avoid being left alone.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t Dad. I screamed upon the realization. My mind couldn\u2019t comprehend what I had just seen. I spun around and tried to run away, completely acting on instinct, and crashed into my sister. She grabbed me, kept me still, and as she looked behind me, down at the dead body on the floor, she began to cry while her hands trembled uncontrollably against my shoulders.\n\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d she said. \u201cHow\u2026 how is it possible? It\u2019s you!\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get a fuck out of here,\u201d I said. \u201cMove!\u201d\n\nThere was nothing that could explain this, and the more my mind tried to\u2013\u2013moving in an endless loop doing so\u2013\u2013the dread grew inside me. I only got a glimpse of the body before I panicked, but my sister was right. The half-rotten face was the same as mine, with a bullet hole in the middle of the forehead.\n\nWe stumbled our way through the living area, tipping over chairs and kicking cans all over the place, and just as we were about to get out of the mess a familiar voice echoed through the hallway we had just escaped.\n\n\u201cJosh!\u201d\n\nIt was Dad. We both stopped in our tracks.\n\n\u201cIs that you? Josh!\u201d\n\n\u201cDad?\u201d I yelled back. \u201cWhat the fuck is going on here?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry!\u201d It sounded like he was at the other end of the bunker, possibly inside the storeroom. \u201cI killed the son of a bitch, put a bullet right between his eyes!\u201d\n\n\u201cCome out from there!\u201d I yelled. \u201cWe have to leave, it\u2019s not safe here!\u201d\n\nSilence.\n\n\u201cSomething is wrong,\u201d Eveline said. \u201cI don\u2019t think\u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cDad!\u201d I yelled. \u201cCome out!\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t move!\u201d Dad said. \u201cI\u2019m stuck under a shelf! I\u2019ll need your help, son!\u201d\n\nI turned to my sister. \u201cGo back up. I\u2019ll get that old bastard out of there. We\u2019ll be right behind you, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cThink, Josh!\u201d Eveline begged. \u201cYou think he\u2019s been stuck under a shelf for\u2013\u201d\n\nI should have listened, but even after what we had just seen I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to even consider something as outlandish as what my sister was suggesting. It was simply too far-fetched, too unbelievable to penetrate all my layers of presumptions about reality. It couldn\u2019t be, it just couldn\u2019t. Hence, I ran back to the hallway, yelling for my sister to get back up to the surface and wait for us there.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming, Dad!\u201d\n\nI only slowed down to carefully step over the corpse that bore my face. Perhaps, I thought, it was just a coincidence. A burglar that just happened to look like me. After all, the face had begun to rot. It wasn\u2019t obviously me. I felt stupid and I almost convinced myself that it was just my childhood fear of the dark coming back to life down here. And then, just as I was about to walk past the small composting toilet that stood inside a small room at the end of the hallway, I stopped. Shivers spread across my entire body, paralyzing me. Dad sat on the toilet. His gun still hung from his trigger finger and his brain was splattered across the wall behind him. He had his journal in his lap, covered in blood.\n\n\u201cJosh!\u201d Dad yelled from the darkness. \u201cHelp me!\u201d\n\nI was frozen in place, both by fear and confusion, unable to make any decisions.\n\n\u201cCome on, Josh!\u201d Dad kept yelling. \u201cI need your help, son!\u201d\n\nMy mind was racing. There was no way of knowing who was who. When I heard Dad\u2019s voice yelling for help while watching his dead body, nothing but absolute terror revibrated inside me. I slowly reached for the journal in Dad\u2019s lap and grabbed it, hoping it would shed some light on the situation. I was just about to open it when my sister screamed. I ran back, this time jumping over my doppelg\u00e4nger's body, and found her looking at something at the corner of the main chamber.\n\n\u201cI told you to\u2013\u201d I said, but changed my mind. \u201cAre you okay, what happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2013\u201d she cried. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d\n\nCrawled up in the corner was her naked, dead body. Her head had been twisted in such a way that the neck had been broken.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something seriously wicked going on here,\u201d I said. \u201cDad shot himself in the head, a long time ago by the looks of it, and yet he keeps yelling for help. Let\u2019s get back to the car, now!\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe drove away from the bunker as fast as we could, leaving whatever was still alive down there yelling for help. My sister insisted on staying at my place for a few days. I didn\u2019t mind having her around. We shared an experience no one else could relate to, and we needed each other to overcome the trauma.\n\nIt took a day for me to build up the courage to open Dad\u2019s journal. It began with his usual deranged conspiracy theories. I flipped past them. At the end, he had only made short notes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Found a hidden door.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Deep pit, possible the remains of some old black project.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Eveline and Josh woke me up.

She\u2019s still out there somewhere. I only got one bullet left. I won\u2019t allow her to do that abhorrent thing to me. Forgive me.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy sister has been cooking for hours. She just called for me from the kitchen:\n\n\u201cJosh?

I was sitting near the front of the plane, just behind first class, and couldn\u2019t really see the commotion. But I could hear someone gasping and retching \u2014 loud at first, then quieter and quieter. A flight attendant got on the PA and asked for \u201cany medical professionals among the passengers\u201d to help. I guess there were none. \n\nAfter a few minutes, the man\u2019s sounds deteriorated into a sort of gurgle, then silence, then it was over.\n\nHis name was Molyneaux, and he was old but not that old, and it was likely a heart attack, aneurism, drug reaction or God\u2019s will, according to conflicting nth-hand reports that filtered down the plane from row 43, where a flight attendant simply buckled the newly deceased back into his window seat and covered his face with a complementary airline blanket.\n\nThe pilot got on the intercom and told us the plane would be turning back to New York \u201cdue to a tragic medical situation involving one of our passengers.\u201d\n\n\u201cFolks, we\u2019re looking for a volunteer willing to sit next to the deceased while we return to our originating airport,\u201d the pilot continued. \u201cThis flight is entirely full, and the person sitting there now isn\u2019t feeling comfortable. It\u2019s an aisle seat, and it will only be a few hours before we\u2019re back over land.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not sure why I volunteered \u2014 probably some combination of exhaustion, altruism and morbid curiosity. My vacation plans were shot anyway, I figured, so why not take the most interesting seat on the plane? The flight attendant thanked me profusely, as did a queasy looking teenager who took my original seat. I picked up my handbag and shuffled down the aisle to the very last row of the plane.\n\nMy only prior experience with corpses was an open casket funeral for my grandmother when I was a kid, but the idea of death had never particularly bothered me. It\u2019s natural, after all. That said, I admit that I second-guessed my decision as soon as I saw my new seat mate.\n\nMr. Molyneaux, rest in peace, sat upright between the window and me, strapped around the waist, with a blue fleece blanket covering his torso and head. The blanket did not cover his hands, which were resting on his lap above his seatbelt \u2014 placed that way by a flight attendant as a sign of respect, I assumed. \n\nMolyneaux\u2019s pale fingers were twisted into claws that betrayed the agony of his death. I couldn\u2019t look at those hands without imagining what his face looked like under the blanket.\n\nI thought of asking for a second blanket, but the flight crew was still busy calming down other passengers and preparing for our u-turn around the Atlantic Ocean. So I tried to forget my uneasiness and closed my eyes, and slept.\n\nI woke \u2014 hours or minutes later, I don\u2019t know \u2014 to the jostling of turbulence. The cabin lights were off and most of the passengers around me seemed to be sleeping. I looked out the window, trying not to look at Molyneaux as I did so, and saw only the uniform blackness of the night. I imagined the ocean miles below us, lightless and cold. The thought unsettled me and I reached across Molyneaux to close the window shade.\n\nThen I stopped myself. *Hadn\u2019t the shade been closed when I sat down?*\n\nI realized there was something else off about the scene. Molyneaux\u2019s posture had somehow changed while I slept. It took me a few seconds to pinpoint it. His gnarled hands remained on his lap, he was still belted at the waist, and the blanket still shrouded his upper body. But the fabric looked somehow twisted now, as if he had been fidgeting.\n\nVery slowly \u2014 knowing it was insane even as I knew I couldn\u2019t stop myself \u2014 I lifted a corner the blanket. \n\nI uncovered his shirt, which the flight crew had unbuttoned while trying to save him. A patch of blue-grey skin sprouting white chest hair peeked out from it.\n\nI lifted the blanket higher. His collar was flecked with dried blood. I remembered his terrible gasping.\n\nFinally, I pulled the blanket entirely off, and stifled a scream.\n\nMolyneaux\u2019s head was turned away from me, exactly as if he had turned to stare out the window. \n\nI could see his face reflected in the plexiglass. It was undoubtably a dead man\u2019s face: pale, drawn, lips parted, jaw slack. There was no life in it.\n\nExcept his eyes. They were moving.\n\nI stared at the reflection for half a minute and I\u2019m sure of it. In the center of that death mask, two pupils flicked back and forth, as if tracking something out there in the sky.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d a voice beside me interrupted. I whipped around and saw the woman seated across the aisle staring at me \u2014 not so much in fear as disgust. \u201cCover him back up! Give him his peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s \u2026 I think he\u2019s been moving,\u201d I stammered. \u201cHis eyes. I think he might not actually be \u2026.\u201d \n\nBut I couldn\u2019t finish the sentence; it was too crazy. Nor did I have to, because at that moment my stomach dropped ten feet along with everything else in the plane. \n\nCoffee cups and purses slammed against the ceiling. A man near the first class section nearly tumbled out of his seat. I heard call lights going off all over the plane as passengers were jolted awake in panic and confusion.\n\n\u201cPassengers, please take your seats, buckle in, and secure any loose items,\u201d the pilot said over the PA, sounding shaken himself. \u201cThe weather along our flight path is clear and no planes in the area are reporting turbulence, so I\u2019m not sure what this is. But we should be through it momentarily.\u201d\n\nEven as he spoke, the mild background shaking I\u2019d felt since waking up became noticeably more violent. The woman across the aisle began fumbling for her seatbelt, no longer paying any attention to me or Molyneaux.\n\nI forced myself to look at him again. The jolt must have caused him to pitch forward at the waist, his head colliding with the seat in front of him. \n\nBut Molyneaux\u2019s face was still turned toward the window \u2014 his neck twisted at such a sharp angle that I worried it had snapped.\n\nI looked at his hands again, and the pallor of his skin. Three flight attendants and a dozen passengers had witnessed this man\u2019s death, and I could not rationally imagine they were mistaken. \n\nAnd yet in the reflection of the window, his eyes left to right, left to right.\n\nI had heard that strange reflexes sometimes kick in after death \u2014 limbs flailing, headless chickens running, nerves clearing out the last backlog of instructions from the brain. But the eyes? I had never heard of that.\n\nI made myself look past that unsettling reflection, at the sky itself. It was still dark, moonless and cloudless, but the atmosphere seemed to have taken on a strange hue \u2014 a very dark green, like pea soup fog. I thought I could see vague shapes swirling around in the murk, though it might have been an optical illusion. I recoiled.\n\nI desperately wanted to be anywhere else right then, but the rest of the cabin was approaching a state a pandemonium. Flight attendants were hurrying up and down the aisles, attending to spills and bruises, even as they tripped and staggered. The entire plane was shuddering like a barrel going down the rapids. \n\nA series of jolts sent Molyneaux\u2019s upper body swinging back and forth like an upside down pendulum. He was thrown backward into his seat, then sideways into me (a horrible feeling I will never forget), and then the opposite way, his face slamming directly into the window, where it came to rest.\n\nThat was enough for me. I unbuckled, leapt out of my seat and locked myself in the bathroom directly behind me. I would cower on a toilet for the rest of this hellish flight rather than spend another minute sitting with Mr. Molyneaux.\n\nThis plan worked for a half hour or so. I braced both my arms against the bathroom\u2019s walls and listened to the chimes of flight attendant call buttons, the whine of jet engines and the growling of the sky. I tried to calm myself by visualizing the skyline of New York, the JFK air strip, a calm descent.\n\nBut then I imagined Molyneaux\u2019s window, his face mashed up against the glass like a little boy\u2019s, his dead eyes searching the night.\n\nThe captain\u2019s disembodied voice called me back to reality. He sounded outright scared now, and the PA kept cutting in and out.\n\n\u201c \u2026 extremely anomalous weather \u2026 need everyone in their seats in the emergency position \u2026 immediately \u2026 if we depressurize \u2026 \u201d\n\nThe turbulence stopped for four or five seconds, and then suddenly it felt like I was inside a washing machine. I bounced against the walls of the bathroom, landed on the floor, and could barely manage to get the door open and crawl on all fours into the aisle.\n\nAll three flight attendants were down, sprawled on backs and bellies between the seats. Some of the overhead luggage bins had burst open and spewed baggage out. Many of the passengers were weeping. A few prayed. And through it all, the plane would not stop shaking.\n\nI heard a series of small bangs above my head and felt something wet on my cheek. Every single soda can in the galley had exploded. I climbed into my seat and belted myself in, having briefly forgotten about Molyneaux in my terror.\n\nTHWACK THWACK\n\nBut he was still in his seat of course, whipping back and forth like a flagpole in a hurricane, head-butting the window so hard that I could see the plexiglass balloon outwards and rebound each time. \n\nTHWACK\n\nI became worried he\u2019d crack the window, though that\u2019s supposed to be impossible, so I overcame my revulsion and grabbed his shoulders. But I couldn\u2019t restrain him. \n\nAgain and again, his head hit the window. I began to fear that it was not simply the motion of the plane that compelled him. \n\nTHWACK THWACK THWACK\n\nNo one else on the plane was watching this. Some of the passengers had rallied and were trying to pull the injured flight attendants out of the aisle. Others were whispering goodbye messages into their phones.\n\nTHWACK THWACK KRKRRRRR\n\nI heard something crack beside me, and hoped desperately that it was Molyneaux\u2019s skull, and not the window. Outside I could see that the green fog was alive with swirling, amorphous shapes.\n\nTHWACK KRKRRRR KRKOOM KRKOOM\n\nAnother explosion. Not pop cans this time, but pressurized oxygen escaping into sky. Molyneaux had managed to smash out both window panes in one, final blow. Now his mangled head was hanging outside the plane, and the rest of his body was straining to follow it, restrained only by his seatbelt and the width of his shoulders.\n\nAn alarm went off in the cabin, and a jungle of oxygen masks fell from the ceilings. I put mine on at once, but heard other people screaming. Some passengers were trying desperately to get masks on the unconscious air crew, but the plane was shaking more violently than ever, and loose debris was flying up the aisles toward my row \u2014 toward the hole a dead man had made in the airplane.\n\n\u201c\u2026 cabin breach\u2026\u201d said the pilot. \u201c\u2026 limited backup oxygen, so I\u2019m trying to descend to a safe altitude \u2026 but hard to do that in this storm, or whatever it is \u2026 God be with us.\u201d\n\nOnce I was sure that I could breath and was no in danger of being sucked out myself, I took one last look at Molyneaux. His head might have torn clean off outside the window, for all I could see of it past the rest of his body. \n\nI pictured those eyes again, which had seen something in the sky that we had not seen \u2014 could not see, even as it now threatened to shake the plane apart. There was some connection between these events that I might never understand. But even without understanding, I could make the last move available to me.\n\nI reached over Molyneaux\u2019s lap, lifted one of those cold, clawed hands, and unclasped his seatbelt.\n\nThere was an intolerable crunching noise as, I presume, his shoulders were squeezed and crushed to fit the window frame. And then in a split second he was gone \u2014 out the window, into the night, a pale old man falling end over end toward the black ocean.\n\n\u201cWhatever you saw out there,\u201d I whispered. \u201cWhatever you were looking for, go to it and leave us be.\u201d\n\nThe green fog lifted a few minutes later, and the plane descended until it was safe to breath without the masks. Less than an hour later, I really did see the JFK airstrip. A whole squadron of police and ambulances met us on the way down. The flight attendants and several passengers had to be hospitalized, but as far as I know no one suffered serious injuries. \n\nFederal investigators eventually concluded that we had flown through a localized weather anomaly \u2014 witnessed by no other plane in the sky that night. Some sort of debris must have been flying around up there with us and taken out the window at 43-A, they wrote in their report: \u201cThis event led to a sudden loss of cabin pressure, in which the body of a passenger who had died earlier in an unrelated medical emergency was ejected from the plane.\u201d  \n\nI expected to hear a lot more about it on the news, but I suppose in the end it was just one of those things. The airline had no interest in publicizing the incident, of course, and the passengers had no desire to relive it. \n\nFor most people on the flight, it was simply a freak tragedy followed by a close call, and all\u2019s well that ends well. I\u2019m the only one that will dream for the rest of my life about Molyneaux\u2019s eyes, and what they saw on the way to the ocean."},"243":{"title":"The previous tenant of my new flat left a survival guide.

The lack of sleep is making me wonder whether all these things happening are in my mind or not. But I\u2019m reminded every time I see that damn note that it\u2019s all real. \n\nI spent hours last night searching for anything I could about Prudence Hemmings. If she had lived in a big creepy mansion I imagine she would have been easy to find. But us folk who live in tower blocks aren\u2019t so well documented. No one cares about our lives, no matter how extraordinary.\n\nI found an article about missing person Lyla Hemmings. It suggested that she went missing under the care of her grandmother while playing in the park opposite the flats early in the morning. Interviews with her parents stated that they had both disowned Prudence. \n\nDespite the many years that had passed since Lyla\u2019s death\/disappearance her parents appeared to have remained unforgiving of Prue. There was no mention of her on either of their social media accounts and she appeared to have no involvement with the children they had acquired since. \n\nSearches for the Hemmings family in the local area were equally dead ends, I looked at link after link, desperate to find something but they all started to blur into one. Until finally I saw something. \n\nAn obituary for Bernard \u201cBernie\u201d Hemmings, who had fallen from the tower block in unexplained circumstances after being diagnosed with dementia months before his death. I was surprised it hadn\u2019t made bigger news. It had only been about a year. There were no details of where to find them, but his wife Prudence and her sister Bridget were listed as contacts to get find out details of the funeral. \n\nIt\u2019s scary what you can do with the internet these days, but just with those phone numbers I was able to put them into a reverse directory and find an address for Bridget and Tony Bishop, the sister and brother in law that Prudence was supposedly living with.\n\nAbout 4am I managed to get some sleep, not much though, I was back up and wide awake at around 7am, planning my route and working out my day. I saw a post on social media from one of her relatives that Georgia was identified and is stable. This loosened the knot in my stomach that has been present since I found the note somewhat. \n\nAt 8.50, I opened the door to my flat hoping to see postman Ian. 4 minutes passed and instead of the postman an elderly gentleman made his way down the corridor. He had a walking stick and kind eyes. In his free arm he carried a small plastic bag containing a newspaper and milk, he smiled and said \u201cgood morning\u201d as he passed.\n\nI smiled back. He reminded me of my grandad. I imagined him pulling cola cubes from his pocket for his grandkids and shushing them when their parents weren\u2019t looking. A little further down the corridor the old man stopped and turned. He looked me dead in the eyes with a sympathetic expression and spoke.\n\n\u201cNo post on a Sunday, if that\u2019s what you were waiting for.\u201d He smiled knowingly and turned to unlock a front door that until shut I couldn\u2019t see the number of. When I saw the door close and the number 48 boldly displayed above the peephole I understood what Prudence had meant. Mr Prentice did seem to be a lovely chap. \n\nI sat back in my flat and sighed, staring at the various tabs open on my laptop. At about 9.15 the knocking on the balcony door started.\n\nThe window cleaner was back.\n\nI didn\u2019t feel half as terrified as I had the first time, if anything, I was just angry. It took every ounce of restraint I had in my tired body not to engage with him, if only to tell him to fuck off. His genuine seeming requests just irritated me. After about 20 minutes of being watched the knocking started to give me a headache, so I grabbed a bag and left the flat.\n\nI decided there was no time like the present. If I was going to turn up on the Bishops\u2019 doorstep looking for her sister because of the freaky flat she\u2019s left behind then I had to get it over with. If the address was old, or the bishops weren\u2019t the people I was looking for then I was going to look stupid whatever time of day I went.\n\nAnd I couldn\u2019t take the window cleaners eyes anymore. There was something about them, they really do make you want to open that door. \n\nI looked at the lift as I entered the communal hallway and decided today I would take the stairs. I couldn\u2019t stand to be in a small box that my partner probably died very painfully in. My heart dropped into my stomach just at the sight of it.\n\nThe stairs were as grotty as the lift. We\u2019d taken them multiple times on move in day but I hadn\u2019t really taken it in the same way I could now. I thought about the rules and all the strange things happening in this building. I looked at the badly painted numbers on the walls as I reached each landing.\n\nNothing in this building is simple.\n\nI looked at the numbers. 7, 6, 5 ... 5, 4, 3, 4, 2, G. Maybe it was the sleep deprivation but my legs were in agreement with my mind that I had definitely just descended more than 6 flights of stairs. They\u2019d glitched. \n\nI looked at the dusty and poorly lit stairwell from the bottom. It seemed dark despite the sun pouring in from the glass panel in the main building doors. The note never mentioned glitchy stairs, maybe I really was losing my mind. \n\nAs I turned to exit the building a woman walked in. She was in her late thirties to early forties and had 2 small children in tow. One boy and one girl. I guessed that they were twins, they were both incredibly blonde, with deep brown puppy dog looking eyes and couldn\u2019t have been any older than 6-7. They were as close to identical as it gets in twins of different genders. I\u2019m not a fan of kids, but they were super cute. \n\nThe lady had a short bob haircut that got longer at the front, it was uniform and dyed a perfectly even auburn colour. I knew it was dyed because her roots were blonde like her kids. She looked as tired as I felt, but she pulled herself together when she saw me, running fingers through s part of her hair that she must have missed how ever early she left this morning. \n\n\u201cHi, are you here visiting?\u201d Who opened with, trying to make small talk. \n\n\u201cNo, I just moved in to flat 42, on the 7th floor, I was just leaving actually. Whereabouts are you?\u201d I was desperate to go, I had feared myself up to see Prue but I didn\u2019t want to be rude.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m flat 26, my name\u2019s Terri. This is Eddie and Ellie.\u201d She gestured to the two small children hiding shyly behind her skirt. \u201cWelcome to the block. If you ever need anything please feel free to give me a shout.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Katie but people call me Kat too. That\u2019s really kind of you, thank you. I will.... hey, is there something wrong with the stairs?\u201d I stopped myself before going into detail.\n\n\u201cNothing wrong, they just skip sometimes.\u201d She answered, shrugging. \n\n\u201cWell I\u2019d love to stop and chat but I actually really need to get going. It was nice to meet you Terri.\u201d I tried to work out what was wrong with the children as I stepped forward to walk away. Still baffled by the stairs.\n\n\u201cBy the way, we have a residents committee, you should come to one of our meetings, they\u2019re every Tuesday in alternating flats. This Tuesday is at Molly Jefferson\u2019s place in flat 31, come along. We\u2019d love to have you!\u201d Terri suggested, waving me off. \n\nI walked out the doors after my encounter with Terri feeling sick. Every minute in this place made the note more real. Every word jumped off the page and into my life. Made it more likely that Jamie was really gone. \n\nI rode the bus from a stop not far from the flats. It felt like it took and eternity to reach the little suburban area I was looking for. A five minute walk away from the bus stop I got off at and I was staring at a quaint little bungalow, belonging to Bridget and Tony Bishop. \n\nI knocked on the door. The lady who opened it was unsteady on her feet, she was probably in her 70s, with wispy white hair neatly scraped back into a bun, two strands left hanging that just softened her wrinkled face. She wore a dusty rose coloured dress that hung just below her knees and smelled of stale cigarette smoke. \n\n\u201cCan I help you?\u201d She asked bluntly.\n\n\u201cMy name is Kat. I\u2019m looking for Prudence Hemmings.\u201d I answered, stuttering slightly. \n\nHer eyes widened slightly.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d She asked, bizarrely. \n\n\u201cIs she here? It\u2019s private.\u201d \n\nThe lady ushered me into the house, and sat me down on a sofa, within minutes there was a cup of tea in front of me. She didn\u2019t say anything to me for a while, we just looked at each other. Then she finally broke the silence. \n\n\u201cI wondered if you\u2019d try and find me. It took me a long time to decide whether to leave that note or not but I decided that you deserved a head start. That\u2019s more than I ever got.\u201d\n\nThe woman was Prudence, she was nothing like I had imagined. She seemed tough and hardened and spoke with a mostly blunt tone, she contributed before I could answer.\n\n\u201cTerri called me not long ago. Told me that she had met the new tenant. She said you looked shaken up, and said that my note may not have been enough. I did say I couldn\u2019t fit everything on there. And the stairs didn\u2019t seem too important. The committee wanted to organise a meeting with you on your moving in day but I told them that was intrusive. The whole committee thing always seemed a bit excessive to me anyway.\u201d She spoke flippantly, like it was nothing. \n\n\u201cIt may have been intrusive, but we needed a warning, we spent a night in the place before I found your note! My boyfriend had already left for work at 3.15 and taken the lift.... he didn\u2019t know.\u201d I broke as I told her what had happened. Her face dropped. And so did my hope for Jamie. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry... I really don\u2019t know what to say. I thought my note would reach you in time.\u201d She mumbled, her face to the floor, refusing to look at me as tears streamed down my face.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone isn\u2019t he. I didn\u2019t want to accept it but I spoke to the postman and your face says all it needs to. The postman said there might be a way I can have him back.\u201d I bit at her, devastated and angry.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone. You can\u2019t have him back. What Ian is referring to isn\u2019t what you think. There\u2019s a way to get people back from the lift. But not as themselves. Trust me, I learned the hard way. Once they\u2019re back you can\u2019t reverse it. I\u2019m sorry about your man. But he\u2019s gone forever. Don\u2019t dig into the other way, to be gone forever is luckier than that alternative.\u201d She still wouldn\u2019t look up from the floor.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean...\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it. I said in the note that there are things I\u2019d rather not discuss and I need you to respect that or I won\u2019t be speaking to you at all. Now move on and ask what you need to ask.\u201d Prudence cut me off, I decided not to push the topic further, and moved on to some other things I needed to know.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with Terri\u2019s kids? They seem sweet and normal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose little demon creatures are anything but normal.\u201d She answered, wincing slightly at the though of them. \u201cWhen she went into labour Terri never made it to a hospital. They were the first children ever to be born inside the building and with everything that goes on it\u2019s like something\u2019s rubbed off on them. They\u2019re average children in the daytime, but they never sleep, ever. Poor Terri hasn\u2019t had a days rest since they were born. They also really love to steal birds and rats they find the cats playing with and torment them. Really annoys the cats.\u201d \n\nAs she finished speaking a small hairless cat strutted out from behind an armchair across the room, meowing softly. It brushed its head up against Prue\u2019s exposed legs, leaving scorch marks where it touched. She didn\u2019t react, she reached down and stroked the top of its head, smiling as it purred. \n\n\u201cAnd those?\u201d I asked, eyes stuck to her now badly burned legs. \n\nShe chuckled, pulled out a box and lit a cigarette, tapping the top layer of ash into a small silver dish in front of her. She offered me one and I took it gladly. \n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve always been my good friends. I couldn\u2019t leave the building without bringing a part of home with me. This little guy is Damon. He\u2019s seen some things.\u201d She gushed, not taking her eyes off the cat. \n\n\u201cBut where did they come from, why are they everywhere?\u201d I asked, watching in disbelief as her burns subsided. It seemed impossible, but I looked at my arms where I had picked up the cat the night before and there was no evidence it had ever happened. They didn\u2019t even appear sunburnt. \n\n\u201cNo one really knows. They started to appear after the fire, a few years after I\u2019d moved in. It was rumoured that they were the pets of the residents that burned, and that was why they had no fur. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nI interrupted.\n\n\u201cI met one of those neighbours last night. She said her name was Natalia. She almost killed my best friend. You\u2019re crazy if you think your note was enough of a warning!\u201d I ranted emotionally.\n\n\u201cLook, girl. If I had made a song and dance about warning you, then you\u2019d have thought me crazy and challenged the rules. You\u2019d have been dead already. Be grateful you got anything. I didn\u2019t. I had to work it all out. Your generation are so spoiled.\u201d She tutted in frustration at me. I was angry, but she was probably right. An elderly lady telling me rat like creatures would kill my boyfriend in a lift would probably have got some laughs from me a few days ago. I stayed quiet and waited for her to calm down, after a while she sighed and started again.\n\n\u201cI think the cats are the neighbours that burned. They\u2019ve never meant any harm and they hiss and run from the imposters that roam the building. Besides, there\u2019s no way there were that many cats living on one floor. \n\nThe imposter people don\u2019t even match up with the residents that died in the fire, none of them look like, or claim to have the same name as the dead. They just claim to live in their flats. I\u2019ve met Natalia before, she left a bad scar on Bernie\u2019s leg from an incident we had, nasty girl. \n\nBefore the fire there was cctv and there was a recording saved of about 15 people marching into the flats and up to that floor about half an hour before the fire started. It was the only evidence found. CCTV wasn\u2019t great in the eighties so they were never identified. And the flames melted the relevant cameras so nothing ever came of it. \n\nI think the people that entered that night are the ones that ask for sugar. I don\u2019t know any more than that but if you avoid them like I said you don\u2019t need to know more. They hate the cats. I hope your friend survives, but I\u2019ve seen what those people can do so maybe she was better off dead.\u201d Prue carried on stroking Damon. I watched the skin of her fingers melt and twist as they made contact with him.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to your husband?\u201d \n\nI asked the question so fast I didn\u2019t have time to consider that this was a topic she had explicitly said she didn\u2019t want to discuss in the note. But I had to know. \n\nShe scowled at me. \u201cI said I didn\u2019t want to talk about that.\u201d She hissed.\n\n\u201cI just lost the love of my life. I need some answers.\u201d I begged.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to Bernie won\u2019t help you. I know you\u2019d think any deaths in that building would be down to the quirks but this wasn\u2019t. For the most part anyway.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that we had lived there for 35 years, Bernie knew the rules, we knew how to take care of ourselves and have a happy life there. It was our home.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that\u2019s Mrs Hemmings, I\u2019m sorry\u201d I interjected.\n\n\u201cBernie had dementia. It started about 6 months before he died and he deteriorated very rapidly. Towards the end he started wandering, the doctors said it was common, but in our position it was incredibly dangerous. More times than I can count I pulled him away from the lift just in time.\n\nAlong with wandering he was forgetting the rules. He let that smug awful window cleaner in 3 times, thank lord for the big metal pipe I kept by the balcony door, chased him out a treat. Not that anything stops him from coming back. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re already acquainted. \n\nAfter all the dangerous situations Bernie was in, by the end he made the smallest and most fatal of errors. \n\nHe left a bowl of food out for Damon at 10am. I was out shopping with Terri and a few of the girls from the committee and when I came back I found one of those awful creatures...\u201d \n\nPrudence started to cry. I put my hand on her shoulder in an attempt to comfort her, after all, I truly knew how she felt. \n\n\u201cIt was eating him.\u201d She sniffed and steadied herself to continue, moving my hand. \u201cI chased the creature away with the same metal pipe I had the window cleaner and pushed Bernie off the balcony. He was heavy but I didn\u2019t want anyone to know what really killed him. It\u2019s teeth..\u201d she shivered \u201c...they made such an awful noise. It reminded me of -\u201c\n\n\u201cLyla.\u201d I finished her sentence. I hadn\u2019t meant to. I was so invested in her story I couldn\u2019t help it. \n\n\u201cI gather you spoke with Ian then.\u201d She said sounding resigned. \u201cI never meant to hurt that little girl. I loved her so much.\u201d Tears rolled down her wrinkled cheeks. Damon, who was now sat next to her on the sofa, shuffled closer as if to cuddle her. \n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you ever been curious about getting her back?\u201d I asked, my mind turning back to the methods hinted at by both Prue and the postman. \u201cI miss Jamie so much. I\u2019d do anything to get him back.\u201d\n\nHer face filled with a look of horror and shame. \u201cOf course I have.\u201d She answered, \u201cwhich is exactly why I\u2019m telling you not to.\u201d \n\nBut I couldn\u2019t let it go. \n\n\u201cSurely anything must be better than gone forever?\u201d I pestered. I wish I hadn\u2019t.\n\nPrudence, frustrated, stood up and gestured for me to follow, she lead me outside to the back garden of the bungalow. At the back was a large shed, the kind people used for a man cave or a summer house. It was pretty, the sun shone down on it lighting up the few cobwebs in the corners and making them twinkle. \n\nMrs Hemmings was careful to look into both neighbouring gardens to ensure there was no one around before she unlocked the door to the shed. We stepped inside and the first thing to hit me was the smell, it was putrid, like rotting meat. I looked at the floor and covered my nose with my hands, staring back at me was a pool of blood.\n\nI followed the blood with my eyes as Prudence locked us in the shed. Then after I made it past the animal bones I finally saw it.\n\nJust like postman Ian had described.\n\nOne of the creatures was watching me, from a heavy duty metal dog cage in the corner of the shed. It looked reinforced but still the metal had chew marks. Their jaws had to be strong to cause that.\n\nThat didn\u2019t surprise me looking at it, it\u2019s rodent like nose and beady, yet somehow human like  eyes were nothing compared to the two very visible rows of jagged sharp teeth that lined each gum. Despite its small stature, it was terrifying. \n\nPrudence opened a drawer in a dusty cupboard across the room and pulled out a can of dog food, she poured the contents into the bowl  and passed the bowl through the feeding hatch. The cage had a safety feature meaning the animal couldn\u2019t access the food until the hatch was locked from the outside. I was grateful for this.\n\nPrue turned to me and spoke. She brushed one of the two strands of hair framing her face behind her ear. Gesturing to the hideous creature she said;\n\n\u201cKat, I would like to introduce you to my granddaughter, Lyla.\u201d\n\nHow the conversation went on : https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/cjintp\/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app"},"244":{"title":"I have an unusual job.

She didn\u2019t flinch, which meant she thought I had a lot to offer. \n\nPretty little thing, she was. Nearly thirty years old, though I\u2019d estimate the age of her modified chest to be about three. Her good looks stemmed mainly from the fact that she\u2019d clearly avoided a lifetime of hard work. I probably would have been equally attractive twenty-five years ago had my twin passions been vanity and stupidity.\n\nThis gal was taken care of.\n\nHer expression glazed for just a moment. I noticed.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she offered timidly, \u201cit\u2019s nothing like that.\u201d She looked up at me with wide eyes that had been conditioned to elicit sympathy. I noticed. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026\u201d she bit her lip. \u201cIt\u2019s just that Raymond\u2019s been gone a month \u2013 but I don\u2019t think that he\u2019s *gone* gone, you know? I want to know if I should put him behind me, or\u2026\u201d She shed a tear. \u201cIt started out small. His favorite sweater would be hanging in the closet, but the next morning, it was lying on the bedroom floor. Not a big deal, you know?\u201d She looked around conspiratorially, despite the fact that no one was in the brightly lit sun porch besides the two of us. \n\nAs if sensing my thought, Sophocles rubbed up against my skirt. I reached down and scratched his ear without turning away from my client. She stared right back at me, looking over the swirling vapor dancing from the teapot\u2019s spout. \n\n\u201cBut then,\u201d she breathed, flushing slightly pink, \u201cI would be, ah, in an intimate moment-\u201d\n\n\u201cMasturbating, or fucking?\u201d I asked bluntly.\n\nHer pink face quickly turned crimson. \u201cUm, the first one. I\u2019d hear a sudden banging on my bedroom door. It would go away whenever I stopped\u2026 what I was doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat makes you think it\u2019s your dead husband?\u201d I pressed her, crushing my cigarette and lighting a new one.\n\nShe gazed down at the table. \u201cHe would *always* interrupt me. Even if it wasn\u2019t\u2026 about anything naughty.\u201d She looked up at me in desperation. \u201cIt just *feels* like him. Does that make any sense?\u201d She bit her lip again. I noticed. \u201cBut the worst thing was last night. That\u2019s what made me decide that it was time to talk with a\u2026 *professional.*\u201d\n\nGod, her little pauses and cute blushing were irritating. I really wanted to slap her. \n\n\u201cExplain,\u201d I ordered cavalierly before taking in that first drag.\n\nA long pull of the cigarette really makes people like her worth it. What was her name? Cindy? She seemed like a Cindy. But the Cindys of the world always scatter from my mind for *just* a few seconds during that first sensual puff. In those moments, I feel so *capable.*\n\n\u201cLast night-\u201d\n\nI coughed. Reality set back in. \u201cListen, Cindy-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Anne-Samantha.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou must have jilled off thousands of times in your life-\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 \u2018jilled\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, are you a Jack from the waist down?\u201d\n\nShe laid a dainty little hand right on her mouth. \u201cOh\u2026 my, no. I\u2019m all Jill, I suppose.\u201d\n\nI grunted. \u201cSo what\u2019s so different about jilling off now?\u201d\n\nHer eyes got wide again, but I had learned long ago to suppress the slap-urge. \u201cWhen I\u2019m alone in bed, I hear breathing. *Only* when I\u2019m alone. It\u2019s unmistakable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, how hard are you working?\u201d I asked pointedly.\n\nShe dropped the hand from her face. \u201cThe breathing is coming from the other side of the room.\u201d\n\nI gave her an unblinking, fixed stare. She returned it.\n\nI finally turned away when a lump of ash fell from my cigarette onto the table. \u201cHere,\u201d I offered, pouring a cup of tea from the pot. I rested my hand on the painted grapefruit and lavender design to hold it steady. \u201cDrink this.\u201d\n\nShe took it obediently, blew on it, then took a sip and winced. \u201cToo hot?\u201d I asked sharply.\n\n\u201cToo bitter,\u201d she responded coolly.\n\n\u201cToo bad,\u201d I finished. \u201cDrink the whole cup if you want to see what\u2019s on the other side.\u201d\n\nShe sipped as I spoke. \u201cYou\u2019ve told me that Raymond\u2019s been gone a month. You\u2019re brokenhearted, but you can\u2019t move on if he\u2019s still here. The shock was terrible, wasn\u2019t it? A hit-and-run while he was crossing the street right in front of your own home. The worst moments of your life were sprinting through the house, knowing what was outside before you saw it. The hope was the worst, because you *knew* that your husband\u2019s broken body would be lying in the street. But the smallest part of you hoped that it wasn\u2019t true, and that *hope* made it hurt so much more. You found him in a gory heap just beyond your front yard, and the future you\u2019d imagined drained away like blood through your fingers. And it was in that exact moment, kneeling in the middle of the street at 7:13 p. m., that you realized your life had been permanently changed to a different path of someone else\u2019s choosing.\u201d I took an aggressive puff of the cigarette and pressed forward. \u201cThe sun set while you held his already-cooling hand, and you realized that this would be the first sunset you\u2019d spend knowing he was dead, and that you would end every day with this thought on your mind from now on.\u201d\n\nShe blanched. \u201cI never told you that it was at sunset. I never even said it was a car accident.\u201d\n\nI narrowed my eyes at her. \u201cThe guilt was more than you expected, because part of you had actually cared about Raymond. Yes, he was old, and *boring,* my God, you would never let him forget it. But he\u2019d felt just so fucking fragile when you crushed his spine with the car that the anger didn\u2019t seem to make sense in the moment.\u201d I blew smoke through my nostrils. \u201cHe knew it was you, Cindy. You pulled the car into the driveway and rinsed off the blood so fast that no one even thought to check it for evidence. But *he* knew, and as he lay dying, unable to speak through shattered lungs, he stared at you without hate, malice, or vengeance. It was simple confusion, Cindy. Raymond never considered that you did it for the cash. His dying thought was wondering how he\u2019d somehow been a bad husband, and he felt guilty for not knowing why.\u201d\n\nHer eyes were shimmering with tears that I believed were genuine, but I didn\u2019t give a shit.\n\nHer cup of tea was empty. \n\n\u201cI was so careful,\u201d she whispered in a pitch that was just below the \u2018only dogs can hear it\u2019 threshold. \n\nI rolled my eyes. \u201cNo you weren\u2019t, Sweetie. People are just stupid, and that\u2019s the only reason you\u2019ve gotten away with everything so far. Really, putting $619,138 cash in a briefcase is just *asking* for trouble.\u201d\n\nHer jaw hung in shock. \u201cHow could you possibly have known?\u201d\n\nI blew one last long stream of smoke from the cigarette. \u201cIf I were in your shoes, Sweetie, I\u2019d be much more worried about how much poisonous oleander you just had with your tea.\u201d\n\nShe slammed her hands on the table and grabbed the edges so hard that the empty cup rattled in its saucer. *\u201cWhat did you do to me?\u201d* \n\nI pulled the cigarette butt from my lips and quashed it in her empty cup. \u201cMake peace with whatever god or devil awaits your heart,\u201d I answered flatly. Then I turned to look across the sun porch at the ghost only I could see.\n\nRaymond was a disgusting mess. His shattered spine had no hope of holding his torso rigid, so every limp limb flopped at unholy angles. A fountain of black blood oozed from his white lips and nose. His intestines protruded from his stomach like ground beef squeezed between grimy fingers, and the coils hung to the ground like sausage links.\n\nHe stared at his young widow. \n\nOr, I should say, the one eye that hadn\u2019t popped to jelly was staring.\n\nI really think that Cindy would have been unnerved if she\u2019d known he was there. \n\nInstead, she focused on me. \u201cHow long\u2026 when will it start?\u201d She asked in utter petrification. \n\n\u201cIn just a second, Sweetie,\u201d I quipped casually, lighting up another cigarette.\n\nRaymond grunted. He wasn\u2019t much for talking, what with the lolling tongue dangling impotently where his missing jaw should have been.\n\n\u201cOh, and one last thing, Sugar.\u201d I leaned forward and gently rested my palms on the tabletop. \u201cRaymond wants to let you know that dying really, *really* fucking hurts.\u201d \n\nShe froze. Behind her, despite lacking a mouth, I could swear that Raymond was smiling.\n\nThe convulsing started then, but it didn\u2019t stop for a long time. \n\nDo you have any idea how far mouth foam can spray when a dying woman just won\u2019t stop thrashing?\n\nI almost felt bad for her when I realized how hard she was trying to cry. \n\nThat\u2019s a really fucking difficult task, though, when your throat is closing up. \n\nThat\u2019s when Raymond sauntered over to her jittering body, knelt down, and gently grazed his dead fingertips across her cheek. He looked passionately into her eyes, and for just a moment, I think she looked back.\n\nThen she was gone. \n\nThe ghost-corpse took in the sight for a few moments before I interrupted him with a forced clearing of my throat.\n\n\u201cA-*hem.*\u201d He glanced up at me with his lone functioning eye. It was damp. \u201cI *do* appreciate your clear instructions on how to locate the briefcase. If everything is as promised, the bill will be settled.\u201d\n\nHe grunted and waved his limp, floppy arm at the body of his dead wife. \n\n\u201cHer? I\u2019ll leave her in the backyard of your house. I snuck an oleander plant into the garden during one of my nightly visits. They\u2019re not uncommon here in Alabama, and they will explain her \u2018accidental\u2019 death nicely.\u201d I wrinkled my nose. \u201cAnd I have to say, I\u2019ll be grateful to stop sneaking into your house each night to spook this murderous little witch.

If I stop watching, I can't save her.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/gtdol4\/i_found_a_disturbing_yoga_stream_if_i_stop\/","flair":null,"author":"relicular","selftext":"She called it *Yoga for One*.\n\nI found her stream a month ago, during a rare confluence of self-disdain and spare time that collided into something resembling motivation. Tucked between the kickboxing classes and the home-gym meatheads was her thumbnail.\n\nIt caught my eye. It was a simple shot of her face, so near to the camera that I could count the freckles. Her teeth a little too large for her mouth and her nose ever so slightly crooked.\n\nI\u2019ve never been the type of guy to consider yoga, but I tuned in, and in a matter of seconds, I was entranced.\n\nThe girl was in her living room, a haphazard mise-en-scene \u2013 the floor speckled with sad little plants and stacks of magazines. She posed with her hands on the floor and her hips thrust in the air. Her butt perched in the center of the screen.\n\nI decided to stay a while.\n\nI had no yoga mat, so I laid out a towel. It was difficult to follow along \u2013 she talked, a *lot*, and only a fraction of it was about the routine. \u201cPress your heels together and bend your head to your feet, breathing deeply. My feet smell like peaches and cream today. Makes me want to gobble them up. I love summer peaches, I love biting into them and feeling the juice erupt in my mouth, it reminds me of the time when \u2013 \u201d\n\nAnd I fell into the meditative quagmire woven by her words, inhaling the scent of my own socks, failing to notice she\u2019d moved into a different pose.\n\nAfter a while, my muscles trembled with the effort of supporting my soft body in these unfamiliar positions, so I called it a day. It was then that I noticed it.\n\n*Subscribers: 1*\n\nThat was me. I was the only one watching. I felt an inexplicable flood of guilt when I closed the browser, like I was abandoning her.\n\nI checked back into her channel the next few afternoons. It was the strangest thing. She was *always* streaming. She was either unaware of my presence, or apathetic to it. Her ramblings, so freewheeling that they approached random word association, didn\u2019t seem to change whether I was there or not \u2013 she was often mid-sentence when I logged in. She was flirty in a way that made it clear she wasn\u2019t trying to be, charmingly raw in her tendency to fumble instructions.\n\nCuriosity overwhelmed me. I yearned to discover more about this fascinating creature. Her movements drew me in, like she was grasping at me through the screen. I marveled at the feeling of being her silent voyeur.\n\nI developed more comfort with the basic poses, though I still couldn\u2019t get my hands anywhere near my toes. Too soon, she notched up the level of difficulty. She eased herself into the splits. Each leg outstretched, her toes pointed at perfect right angles. I tried my best to replicate the pose, my groin protesting the pressure. Each day, she pushed a little farther. She curved her spine sharply behind her, a graceful arc. She lifted her back leg high into the air at an angle that seemed to wrench her hip out of place.\n\nI forced my body into the closest approximations of her geometry that my tendons would allow, my teeth gritted against the sharp warnings issued by my nerves. At night I dreamed that she was breaking my joints, cracking my limbs into the clean shapes that she maintained so effortlessly.\n\nOne day she twisted her arms so far behind her that I felt sympathetic pain, and folded herself up so that her bent legs swooped around her shoulders, touching her toes behind her neck. She smiled at the camera, demurely, politely. \u201cYou want to see me bend into a pretzel, don\u2019t you?\u201d she asked.\n\nThat was the first time she addressed me.\n\nI would forget to eat. I\u2019d wake up on the couch, having dozed off, and she would be murmuring about pomegranates while her forehead brushed her knees. Did she sleep? Did she eat? I saw no evidence of it.\n\nEvery time I moved, my body ached with the memory of being stretched to its limit. I was spending ten, twelve, fourteen hours a day on her stream. She spoke to me frequently. \u201cI know you\u2019ve been watching me. I think you like watching me. How far do you want me to twist for you?\u201d\n\nThe fluid shifting of her body into vertices and curves and delicate polygons was hypnotizing. I was getting lost in the light of a flickering flame as it swirled into different patterns. I was working myself into something more pliable, molding myself into something like her image.\n\nIt's difficult to pinpoint the moment she went too far. It was more like the creep of quicksand than any one single point.\n\nShe would lie on her back and lift herself on the palms and soles of her feet, her torso thrusting at the ceiling like she was something from the Exorcist. She would inch her hands and feet closer together, folding her body backwards on itself until she was nearly split in half. And then she would skitter forward until the whites of her eyes flooded the screen, scaring me so much that I jumped. And she would laugh, as if she had made a joke.\n\nShe would twist her head around like an owl, and thrust it between her thighs. Always blinking at the screen. Always smiling like we were sharing some inside secret, like I was in on the sly conspiracy.\n\nShe said, \u201cYou like this, don\u2019t you, Mr. Smith? Am I your foldable pocket toy?\u201d\n\nSmith is a very common last name. There was a nonzero chance she\u2019d just guessed correctly. But this freaked me out enough to slam the laptop shut, shattering the image of her toothy smile.\n\nI tried to resume normal life. But I had almost nothing to fill my time except television and social media and filling out applications for jobs I\u2019d never want to work. A strange sensation tickled at me, like something was wrong, like I was forgetting something. And powerful waves of guilt, the same guilt I\u2019d felt when I closed her stream the first day I\u2019d found her.\n\nI tried not to. I really, really tried to stay away. But the urge overwhelmed me, so I returned.\n\nFor the first time, she wasn\u2019t onscreen when I logged in. I peered closer at the scene, seeing the familiar yoga mat on the ground, the coffee table, the magazines. There was a soft noise coming from just off-screen, a muffled noise, irregular and halting. A human voice. I turned the volume all the way up, and I couldn\u2019t tell if it was laughter or crying.\n\nFeeling sick, I closed the stream.\n\nThis brings us to yesterday.\n\nI had spent countless hours thinking about her, wondering what she was doing, whether she was still telling stories to her invisible visitor. I logged in.\n\nHer eyes filled the webcam\u2019s field of vision, so suddenly that I scrambled backwards. And that sound \u2013 echoing around the walls of her apartment and mine, and it was now clear that it was a sound of misery.\n\nHer moan was wordless, and as her face backed away, I saw why. Her bare foot was stuffed halfway in her mouth, her jaw nearly unhinged to accommodate it, the ball wedged between her teeth. Tears were streaming down her face, pooling around the corners of her stretched lips.\n\nHer arms were folded behind her head and her other leg was tucked under the first. She was struggling, and I realized that she was stuck.\n\nShe was trapped in that position, a twisted ball of limbs and strained joints, unable to speak.\n\nI stared slackjawed at the screen, and her eyes met mine, seeming to blink in recognition. The force of her sobs crescendoed. In relief? I wasn\u2019t sure.\n\nI had no idea what to do. I didn\u2019t know her name or where she lived \u2013 I didn\u2019t even know for sure that she was in the same country. I sat, frozen, for long moments, watching the twitching of her limbs as she tried to wrench herself out of the cage her body made. Then it struck me: I could type.\n\n*Can you type your address?*\n\nThe messaged pinged its arrival at her computer. Our first real communication.\n\nShe shook her head almost imperceptibly, with the slight range of motion her position allowed.\n\nI tried again: *Can you type with your nose?*\n\nHer eyes flickered across the page as she read my words. With great effort she rocked herself over, landing face-first on the keyboard. *sivioshgeusoh*, she typed.\n\nMy heart pounding, I said, *try again*.\n\nI watched as she managed to prop herself precariously on one shoulder. Her body was convulsing with the force of her sobs. Eventually, she leaned forward, carefully, delicately, and pressed the tip of her nose to the keys. *3*.\n\nYes! That was it! *That\u2019s great. Give me another number.*\n\nWe traded for long, suspenseful minutes, her giving me one number or letter at a time, me writing them down and encouraging her as best I could. *You\u2019re doing great. I\u2019m here with you. Help is on the way.*\n\nShe had cobbled together a number and a street. It had taken us nearly an hour to get to this point. She had just finished typing *apt12* when she stopped, trembling with the effort of keeping herself upright, and we met eyes again through the camera, hers shining with pain and fear. And then she collapsed.\n\nShe rolled out of sight. Panicking, I sent her dozens of frantic messages: *What city? What state? Stay with me. I\u2019m here. Where are you? I need more.*\n\nIt became clear that no more was coming. Her sobs stilled, her breath quieted.\n\nI searched the address and found every city in the country where the address she\u2019d given me existed. I called every police station in every jurisdiction within range. It took a *lot* of explanation, but after hours of work there was nothing I could do but sit and wait nervously by the phone and stare at the empty apartment framed within my laptop screen.\n\nAll I could do was type.\n\n*I\u2019m here with you.*\n\n*You\u2019ll be safe.*\n\n*This will be over soon.*\n\n*You\u2019re not alone.*\n\nThe ringing of the phone nearly sent me out of my skin. It was one in the morning.\n\n\u201cDid you find her?\u201d I asked desperately, scanning the scene for any sign of activity. \u201cTell me she\u2019s all right!\u201d\n\nThe voice on the other end of the line sighed, a deep sigh, of sadness or frustration I couldn\u2019t say. \u201cWe found her,\u201d he said, his words gentle but guarded. \u201cStuck in that position, as you described. She\u2019s\u2026 she\u2019s not okay. She died of dehydration.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe \u2013 what? No. That\u2019s not possible. I just spoke to her!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you saw, son. I truly don\u2019t. But the girl we found has been dead for a month.\u201d\n\n[*x*](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relicularity\/)"},"246":{"title":"Because You Are My Baby","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/ai41d3\/because_you_are_my_baby\/","flair":null,"author":"Dopabeane","selftext":"My mother had the most beautiful teeth.\n\nHer teeth are my first memory. I remember them: long and white and bared in a ferocious grin, shining under the full moon as she told me a story. Not a fairy tale or picture book, but *my* the story. The story of how I\u2019d come to her\u2026or rather, how she\u2019d come to me. \n\nWhen I was very small \u2013 too small to remember anything at all \u2013 my mother stole me from a man, and took me to live in the forest.  She stole me not as an act of love, but as an act of revenge. Though I was desperate to know, she never told me what needed revenging.\n\nOne night, I finally asked, \u201cWhy won\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause you are my baby,\u201d she whispered in her low, wet voice. She stroked my face with long fingers. Her teeth glittered under the stars, rich and pale as polished ivory. \u201cMy baby will never hear, or see, or know the cruelties that haunt me.\u201d \n\nCruelty was not the only thing my mother knew that I did not, although it *was* the only thing she refused to teach me. My mother tried very hard to teach me everything else she knew. Unfortunately, I was a very poor pupil indeed.\n\nMy mother was a remarkable huntress. She felled elk and bear effortlessly. Sometimes she slid into the lake without so much as a ripple, and returned hours later with a monstrous fish clamped in her jaws.\n\nBecause hunting came so easily to her, Mother expected me to learn quickly. \u201cMen hunt,\u201d she hissed. \u201cThey have always hunted. So shall you.\u201d\n\nBut I could not hunt. Not like her. My small, soft fingers were no match for her lethal claws. My clumsy little body \u2013 somehow so susceptible to both the heat and the cold \u2013 trailed after her whiplike predator\u2019s form. Mother caught deer and foxes with her beautiful teeth, striking from the shadows like a snake. By contrast, my dull teeth could not even crush rabbit bones.\n\nI persevered, but did not improve. One night, while Mother snaked through the shadows, communing with trees and evading the dark things prowling the night, I curled up and wept. \n\nShe found me that way, weak and weeping. I covered my eyes and held my breath. I knew it was useless \u2013 Mother could hear my heartbeat from the other side of the hill, so she surely knew I was crying \u2013 but that small scrap of pride was all I had.\n\nMother stood there for a long while. Then she crept forward and covered me with fresh leaves before lying beside me. \u201cI will feed you, always,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBecause you are my baby.\u201d\n\nIn addition to hunting, my mother was a phenomenal creator of shelters. Sometimes she lived within the earth, snaking through loam and tree roots like treasure-hoarding dragons of old.\n\nSometimes she lived in the trees. Many nights I watched in awe as her bones elongated and tore through her rough skin, stretching upward to twist among the branches like an ancient spider god. I would wait patiently, sometimes for hours, as Mother communed with the spirits buried in the roots.\n\nAnd sometimes she lived in the shadows, creeping through the darkness to flush out food and threat alike. \n\nSo, Mother tried to teach me to dig burrows. But I could not dig like her. I was too small and too soft, and far too frightened of the bugs and moles that tunneled through the earth.\n\nSo she tried to teach me to live among the tree branches, to rest and listen as the redwoods murmured the long, strange histories of the earth. But my bones could not stretch like Mother\u2019s. I could not twist my arms to match the branches. My skin could not interlock with the treebark, and my blood was too sluggish to melt into the sap.\n\nSo Mother tried to teach me to live in the shadows. But the darkness terrified me. Every night, I hid and wept, imagining the legs of centipedes crawling across my skin. All the night creatures reveled in my fear; owls swooped down to taunt me and bats torpedoed toward me, giggling in their shrill, squeaking voices until mother slapped them out of the sky.\n\nFinally Mother realized the futility of these lessons. So she dug a deep burrow just for me. She lined it with leaves and slurped the worms and roaches from the walls. When she finished, I burst into tears.\n\n\u201cWhy do you weep?\u201d she rasped.\n\n\u201cBecause you do everything for me.\u201d I knew the laws of nature. I knew the laws of forest creatures and their young. Young that were weak were killed in the nest. Young that could not learn to fend for themselves were abandoned to die. I was weak and soft and coated in terrible, ugly scars. \u201cWhy do you do everything for me?\u201d\n\nMother snaked forward, long, large hands sinking into the earth. She curled around me and pulled me close. \u201cBecause you are my baby.\u201d\n\nMother did not always live in the burrow with me. She roamed the mountains. She burrowed with moles, slithered with snakes, grazed with elk, hunted with wolves, stood with trees. \n\nWhen I was very small, I thought she ate the forest. But it was not that simple; she protected it, and in return it sustained her. \u201cMy heart,\u201d she told me one rainy night, \u201cis the forest, so this is how it must be.\u201d\n\nAs I grew older, I developed rudimentary survival skills. I shied away from hunting big game \u2013 elk and deer, bears and boar \u2013 because I did not protect the forest. I gave it nothing; I only took, so I took as little as I could. I trapped rabbits, fished the streams, and ate wild berries. I dared take nothing else.\n\nOnce I could reliably feed myself, Mother stayed away for long stretches. Hours, then days, and finally weeks. I missed her terribly, with a deep, panicky ache.\n\nI confronted her about it one balmy spring evening. \u201cYou leave me more and more,\u201d I accused. \u201cSoon you\u2019ll leave me forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever,\u201d she murmured. A breeze twined around us, raising gooseflesh on my skin and rippling her long white hair. \u201cI will never leave you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you do!\u201d I screamed. \u201cYou already do!\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore you came, I lived among the trees, listening to their warnings. I slept in the warm earth as worms and centipedes nibbled my skin. I spent many of your lifetimes within the forest, little one \u2013 so many lives at a time that I forgot my own name. I do not leave you. I have left the forest for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t come here,\u201d I sobbed. \u201cYou took me!\u201d\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I will never leave you. When you think I\u2019ve left, silence yourself and listen. Listen for me the way I listen for the trees, the animals, and the stars. If you are silent and you are sincere, you will hear me.\u201d\n\nAnd then she left.\n\nFury and jealousy seared my heart like a wildfire. She insulted me, she humiliated me, and after all that she *left* me. Left me for the centipedes and the wolves and the stupid, chittering bats.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need you!\u201d I screamed. An owl hooted angrily in response. \u201cI don\u2019t need you at all!\u201d\n\nThen I ran for my burrow. As it the earthen door materialized before me, nodding with flowers and wild grasses, anger swelled inside me. It possessed me, this wild ball of misery borne of my own endless fear and inadequacy. And it spoke to me.\n*Why should you return to the burrow?* it asked. Why indeed? It wasn\u2019t mine. It was Mother\u2019s. The entire forest belonged to Mother. Without her, the forest would have consumed me long ago.\n\nSo I turned away from the burrow and kept running. *I will find the end of the forest,* I decided. *I will leave it once and for all.*\n\nI ran for days, in the process treating the forest with contempt. I stripped the trees of their leaves to make nightly beds. I threw rocks at birds and rabbits. I uprooted bushes and stripped entire groves of their berries, eating until I threw up from sheer excess. Then I ate again. Not out of hunger, not out of any need, but out of malice.\n\nAnd one day \u2013 long after spring ceded to summer in a verdant explosion of heat and greenery \u2013 I heard voices.\n\nI froze immediately. The only voice I knew was Mother\u2019s \u2013 wet and low, an earthy, rib-shaking whisper. These voices were nothing like Mother\u2019s. They were high and somehow infantile, with strange, shrill notes.\n\nThese voices\u2026they were like *mine.*\n\nTrembling, I dropped low and crept through the underbrush. Sun-warmed leaves brushed against my face, smooth but painfully crisp; the sun was taking its toll on them. I snaked over the ground, pretending I was Mother, slipping through the forest like an invisible snake.\n\nI reached a break in the trees and peered through.\n\nIn a small clearing were four creatures. They had pink skin and wore heavy clothing that looked suffocating. There hands were small and soft. Their faces were smooth and babylike, somehow half-formed: wide eyed and rounded, with soft noses and plump flesh.\n\nI touched my face \u2013 flat and smooth - and looked down at myself: mudstreaked, deeply tanned, and marked with a hideous mass of scars, but still *soft.* Hairless, small, weak. There was no mistaking it. These things in the woods \u2013 these overdressed, half-formed beings with small teeth and no claws and overlarge eyes \u2013 were like me.\n\nThey were men.\n\nI stood up, propelled by panicky excitement, and strode forward. All at once, they froze.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d one whispered. He lifted something in his arms and pointed it at me. It was long and strange to me. Inorganic, not alive, with a wooden handle and a gleaming tube.\n\nJust then, I realized something: the forest was silent. A few birds chirped and sang, and a few bugs emitted their persistent drone. But the vast majority \u2013 birds, insects, trees \u2013 were silent. No rabbits, no deer, certainly no bears. These things \u2013 these creatures like me, these *men* - had silenced the earth.\n\nThey\u2019d stolen the forest from itself. \n\nWe stared at each other for a long time as ever-growing summer heat filled the clearing like an invisible pool.\n\n\u201cMother,\u201d I whispered. \u201cMother, please help me.\u201d\n\nShe did not. So I turned and ran.\n\nThe men immediately pursued. I could hear them: yelling, crushing the undergrowth, stamping on blossoms and bugs, snapping branches as they ran. The forest\u2019s deathly silence was worse than any cry.\n\n\u201cThere it is!\u201d one of them screamed. A second later, the forest exploded: a deafening *boom* shook the trees and ate through the air as pain erupted on my shoulder. I didn\u2019t dare stop or look. I pressed on, running and crying as the men came after me.\n\nThe forest seemed to punish me for my earlier cruelty. Brambles scratched my legs. Stones cut my feet. Branches swiped at my face, leaving deep, stinging runnels. I thanked the forest for its kindness. I thanked it for punishing me, rather than stopping me. \n\nThe men gasped and wailed amongst themselves. \u201cWhat the hell is it?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. *I don\u2019t know!*\u201d \u201cIs it a\u2026a kid?\u201d \u201cLook at its face. Look at its fucking face! That isn\u2019t a kid!\u201d\n\nSomething suddenly filled my ears, drowning the sounds of the men and the forest. A deep, musical rushing, like birdsong transformed into a turbulent river.\n\nAnd then Mother came, erupting from the trees like a great beast of old. But that\u2019s what she was, after all. A great beast, surely a daemon of the ancient world.\n\nShe pounced upon the men, batting them the way a housecat bats its toys. She clamped one between her claws, squeezing until his head separated and went rolling across the ground.\n\nOne by one Mother caught and tore them, shredding them the way she shredded leaves for my bedding. Blood streaked the forest, turning the dirt to mud and dripping from the trees like sluggish rain. \n\nMother dug her claws into the skull of the last survivor and cracked it open like a fruit. Blood and grey brain glistened in the sunlight. The man screamed, and screamed, and screamed.\n\nMother leaned down and extended her tongue. It curled outward, pale and orange-gold like sunrise on a cold, clear morning, and delicately slurped his brains. Curl by curl, like so many worms from my burrow walls.\n\nBy the time he stopped screaming, the forest had returned to its loud, familiar glory: murmuring trees, singing birds, skittering insects, grazing deer. \n\nI smiled and ran to Mother. She reared up and screamed, \u201c*See what you\u2019ve done!*\u201d\n\nTerror paralyzed me. I looked helplessly at her \u2013 blazing eyes, contorted face runneled with earth and wildflowers, sunbleached bone and pale, spongy rot. My mother, my beautiful daemon mother who claimed me out of revenge and raised me out of obligation, staring at me like I was a man.\n\n\u201cWhen you stone a bird, my heart stops! When you break a branch, my bones snap! When you selfishly strip the shrubs of their fruit, of their very birthright, my skin blisters! When you hurt the forest,\u201d she roared, \u201c*my heart bleeds!*\u201d\n\nI fell to my knees and hid my face. Mother rushed forward on her many limbs and wrapped long fingers around my throat. She lifted me up, dangling me over the forest floor. \u201cI killed men for you! Now more will come! They will trample! They will cut! They will burn! They will kill! They will kill the bears and the cougars and the wolves, for they will blame the predators for what I have done for you! Do you see?\u201d She shook me. The carnage below seemed to swing beneath me, a tapestry of blood-soaked earth and ruined corpses. \u201c*Do you see?*\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Mother,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI see.\u201d\n\nShe dropped me. I hit the ground with such force it knocked the wind out of me. Mother pulled back and busied herself with one of the corpses. I looked up, shaking. Birds watched from the trees, quick and curious and full of condemnation. I averted my eyes as tears spilled.\n\nMother returned to me. She extended an arm and opened her hand. Upon her large palm were four eyes and a large, glistening heart. I stared at them blankly, then looked up at her.\n\n\u201cFour eyes,\u201d she said. \u201cOne from each man. And the heart of the one that shot you. Eat.\u201d\n\nMy lip quivered. I couldn\u2019t tear my eyes away from the gore in my mother\u2019s hand. A heart and eyes. Raw and plump, alive just minutes ago.\n\n\u201cMother,\u201d I said. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you of me?\u201d she asked. \u201cOr are you of man?\u201d\n\nThe forest became painfully silent. The animals, the trees, and the insects, all waiting with bated breath.\n\n\u201cI am of you, Mother.\u201d I plucked the first eye from her palm. It was round and curiously firm, with a sort of firm, watery texture I associated with half-rotten fruits. The pink, wormy optic nerve dangled. For a terrible moment I thought I would vomit.\n\nThen I raised it to my lips and bit in.\n\nThe eyes were awful, the heart even worse: thick and almost impossible to chew. Mother had to tear it for me, slicing it into manageable pieces with her beautiful teeth. \n\nWhen I finished, Mother picked me up and, holding me tightly, streaked back to the burrow as night fell.\n\nThat night, I became ill. I shook and shivered and hallucinated for days. My mind bled with images of dangling eyes and glistening hearts and skulls cracked apart like pomegranates. Mother lay with my all the while, soothing me with ancient songs like birdsong turned to rivers, and cooling me with her damp, earthy breath.\n\nFinally the fever broke. I sat up, gasping as the last vestiges of my nightmare drifted away.\n\nMother sat across the burrow, hunched over tiredly. \u201cYou are well,\u201d she said. \u201cI am glad, for I must leave.\u201d\n\nI blinked tiredly. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cMen,\u201d she said. \n\n\u201cBut you killed them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are more,\u201d she said. \u201cThey creep into the forest, searching for their dead brethren. They are cutting the trees and crushing the flowers and killing the bears, my little one. If I don\u2019t stop them, they will even come for you. I have to stop them. My heart is the forest, and so are you. I must protect both.\u201d\n\nA lump rose in my throat. Shame like I\u2019d never known enveloped me. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are my baby. Babies must learn. By learning, they grow.\u201d\n\n\u201cMother,\u201d I said. \u201cAm I truly of man?\u201d\n\nMother closed her eyes. For a long time, she did not speak. Then she drew a deep breath. \u201cI took you from a cruel man. Listen. I will tell you now of the cruelties I endured.\u201d\n\nI listened, enraptured and horrified, as she spun her sorry tale.\n\nMother was once a young, beautiful human woman.\n\n\u201cSurely not more beautiful than you are now,\u201d I objected.\n\n\u201cListen!\u201d she said.\n\nMother was alone in the world. She had no family or friends. She once had a family, but they harmed her greatly so she ran away. She lived in the forest, in a small, ragged tent. She ate wild berries, fished the lake, and boiled water to drink.\n\nLaws are strange things. Though Mother hurt nothing and no one, she was breaking the law by living in the forest. She was found, and caught, and imprisoned. Separated from the trees and the birds, Mother faded quickly. Though she was only jailed for a short while, it nearly killed her. The day she was released was the best day of her life\u2026\n\nOr so she thought.\n\nNo sooner had Mother gathered her meager belongings and exited the jail than a guard came up beside her. \u201cWhere are you headed to?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019ll take you wherever you want to go.\u201d\n\nMother was ecstatic. \u201cTake me back to the forest,\u201d she said. The guard obliged, driving her toward the woods. Except he stopped too soon. He stopped at a house. His house, it turned out.\n\nThe guard was a terrible man. He trapped Mother. He hurt her, tortured her, abused her in every way. He cut her open, he burned her, he snapped her bones. \n\nAnd he put a baby in her. Mother was so broken that he missed all signs of impending childbirth. When I came, Mother died.\n\n\u201cHe dumped me in a vat of acid,\u201d Mother told me, \u201cand scattered my liquid remains among the trees. But then I heard you.\u201d Mother smiled faintly. Crumbles of dirt and root fell from her face. \u201cI heard your cry. Your need for me.\u201d\n\nI do not understand what Mother said next; it is difficult to translate. But the closest I can come is this. Everyone sings a song to those they love. Most aren\u2019t able to hear these songs. If you can\u2019t hear, it can\u2019t help you. But if you can hear it, a song is the most powerful thing in the world. It kills. It calls. It consumes. It destroys. It strengthens.\n\nAnd sometimes, it resurrects.\n\n\u201cWhen I reformed and breathed again, I stole you from your father,\u201d Mother said. \u201cThen I brought you here, because you are my baby.\u201d\n\nI wept silently, because I didn\u2019t know what to say.\n\n\u201cI must go,\u201d she said. \u201cThe trees and the animals need me now. So remember, little one. When you are silent and you are sincere, you will hear me.\u201d\n\nThen she whipped around \u2013 like a wolf, a snake, and hawk combined \u2013 and left.\n\nShe did not return.\n\nAt first, I thought nothing of it. I had made a terrible mess; I had summoned men. I had caused the forest to bleed. Mother had a great deal of work ahead of her.\n\nBut summer slowly bled into fall, and still Mother did not return. When the first snow came \u2013 dry and cold, skittering across the landscape like powder \u2013 I knew something was wrong.\n\nThe snows deepened. The forest drifted into its winter sleep, cloaked in ice and fog. Every night, I made myself silent. I mustered all the sincerity I could. And I listened for my mother\u2019s voice.\n\nIt didn\u2019t come.\n\nI grew thin and sick. My skin burned even as I shivered. My chest grew congested, my throat so sore I couldn\u2019t sleep. My breath came in sharp, pained wheezes.  Soon I became too weak to leave the burrow. I crawled to the doorway and ate snow. For sustenance, I slurped worms from the earthen walls. \n\nIt was not enough, and I knew it.\n\nOnly then \u2013 in the quiet and peace and fear of approaching death \u2013 did I become truly silent. Only then did I hear the voice of my mother.\n\nI heard her in my dreams: the low, rushing voice like music made into water. *I am coming,* she said. *I am coming, because you are my baby.*\n\nI smiled, and slept. \n\nNext thing I knew, I was cold. Cold and wet and shivering, but *awake.*I shot up and screamed as my skin brushed the thick, flower-matted hide of my mother. I spun around, smiling, and froze.\n\nMother lay beside me, panting. Blood seeped from a hundred wounds, crusting her hair. The exposed bones in her face were crushed and concave, leaking gore and blood. Without opening her eyes, she smiled. \u201cI heard you. I heard your song.\u201d\n\nTears blurred my vision. My chest began to hitch. I couldn\u2019t draw breath; it was like I was sick again, drowning in pus and trapped fluid. Only I wasn\u2019t dying this time.\n\nMy mother was.\n\n\u201cThen stay,\u201d I said. \u201cYou have to stay, because you can hear my song.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cYou needed to see me again. But you do not need me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need you. Mama, *I need you.*\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI killed all who would harm you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what about the forest? The forest will kill me without you!\u201d\n\nShe chuckled. Her breath came, terribly fast and increasingly weak. \u201cYou are of me. Remember. You are of me. You are my baby.\u201d\n\nMy mother \u2013 my beautiful, ancient mother \u2013 drew a shallow breath, and lay still.\n\nI lay beside her for many days. Then, when she began to stink, I left. A hiker eventually found me. A stupid, solitary hiker with a soft heart, a great deal of patience, and no fear.\n\nWhen I learned to speak the words of men, the authorities lost no time in telling me that Mother was not really my mother. \n\nThey discovered my identity (at least in a manner of speaking) through DNA. My real mother, they say, was a vagrant. A Jane Doe who lived in a tent in the national park. She was alone and defenseless, two things that attract human monsters. After a brief stint in jail for loitering, my mother ended up kidnapped, imprisoned, and tortured by an as-yet unidentified assailant who eventually tried unsuccessfully to dissolve her in acid. They think he attempted to dissolve my body, too. That\u2019s why I am covered in scars. It is why I frightened those hunters so long ago: the acid burns make me look like a monster to men.\n\nSince my real mother apparently died long ago, they decided that Mother \u2013 whoever she was \u2013 was nothing but a crazy, homeless child abuser.\n\nBut I know better.\n\nEven so, I adapted. I had no choice. I am of my mother, but I live among men. That\u2019s what animals must do; their young learn, grow, and adapt. If they don\u2019t, they die. \n\nBut I am not adapting anymore. At least, I am not adapting to live among men. My mouth is changing. Changing in ways that are terrible to people, but wonderful to me. It\u2019s my teeth, you see.\n\nI am growing my mother\u2019s beautiful teeth.\n\nLooking at my teeth in the mirror was frightening and electrifying. Joy and terror ran through my veins in equal measure. It had to mean something. So I fell silent. I became sincere. I listened.\n\nAnd I heard.\n\nI heard the voice of my mother: low and rushing, like birdsong turned to a wild river. She tells me I do not belong with men, because I am her heart, and her heart is the forest. She tells me I must return.\n\nAnd she tells me she is waiting for me, because I am her baby.\n"},"247":{"title":"My job is watching a woman trapped in a room. Final Part.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/bue2kk\/my_job_is_watching_a_woman_trapped_in_a_room\/","flair":null,"author":"Verastahl","selftext":"[Part One](https:\/\/redd.it\/brco33)\n**** \n[Part Two](https:\/\/redd.it\/brsj8v)\n**** \n[Part Three](https:\/\/redd.it\/bsg2az)\n**** \n[Part Four](https:\/\/redd.it\/btkvkl)\n**** \n\n\nI spent the next five days watching Rachel die.\n\nFrom the outside, just watching the monitor, it didn\u2019t seem that different than what I had been watching for the past three years.  Rachel slept, she watched T.V., she read, and she painted.  But there were signs if you were looking for them.  She seemed tired and tense, and she had taken to sleeping more.  And occasionally, just every once in a while, she would glance up at the camera\u2014at me.  It was then that I could see the fear and sadness in her eyes.\n\nInside\u2026well, inside I felt like a burned out house collapsing in on itself.  At first I refused to watch, to do anything they wanted me to do.  Solomon didn\u2019t get mad at me, but just shrugged.  He said while cooperation was preferred and could go a long way toward making my stay with them more comfortable, it wasn\u2019t required.  \n\nIf he was right, Solomon said with a thin smile, things would play out as they were meant to, regardless of what I wanted or thought I chose.  Either way, he added, the video was about to start back playing and would not stop for another five days.  Whether I wanted to spend that time getting to see her again was entirely up to me.\n\nI tried to not watch, but a part of me knew from the start I was going to.  Maybe I would find some clue that they were lying about her being dead.  Or Rachel could give me some advice or warning about what I needed to do next.  I didn\u2019t know.  What I did know is that I couldn\u2019t miss the chance to see her again.  And despite knowing in my heart that she was dead and everything on the video had happened a long time ago, I still felt that by watching I was with her somehow.  \n\nShe had been taken away from everything she knew when she was barely grown, trapped for years just for being special.  Experimented on.  Treated like property.  Kept from ever having friends or family or a life.  And yet through all that, she was still beautiful.  Not just on the outside, but on the inside too.  I had spent years watching her, getting to know her in a thousand tiny ways that so few people ever truly know each other.  I had seen her kindness and grace in her actions, even when she was fighting against the people holding her.  I had watched her strength when she woke up day after day in her prison and never gave up.  And I saw the beauty of her soul in her paintings, full of swirling colors and\u2026what was the word\u2026wonder.  She was able to paint these things she saw with such care and love, despite living in a world that had abandoned her so completely.\n\nWell I wasn\u2019t abandoning her.  I would watch every bit of the video I could manage.  Try to burn into my memory every frame of her I saw.  Not for them and their stupid project.  But for me.  And for her.  I may not have much left to do in my life before they lock me away somewhere or kill me, but I could do this one last thing.\n\nRachel wouldn\u2019t die alone.\n\n****\n\nI watched nearly all of it, stopping only to eat quickly and use the bathroom until the last two days.  I would ask the guards to pause it, but they would only shake their heads and say Solomon said it had to play normally until it was finished.  By the fourth day, I was in a stupor.  I had already dozed some the first three days, but when I woke up on the fourth day, I could tell a few hours had passed.  There were two trays of food on the bed, one breakfast and another lunch.  I looked back at the screen in a panic, worrying I had missed something, but Rachel seemed to be just waking up too.  I noticed her putting her hand to her stomach as she got out of bed and felt my own stomach twist.  She was already hurting.  Rachel glanced at the camera and tried to smile before moving to set up a new canvas for painting.  \n\nThis was the second of three paintings she did in those last days.  The first had been the inside of an old-fashioned movie theater from the viewpoint of someone sitting in a back row.  On the movie screen was just the image of a sledgehammer propped against a brick wall.  I didn\u2019t understand what it meant, and I found myself scanning the picture for some message or other clue.  Eventually I found what might be one, though I didn\u2019t understand it either.\n\nRachel must have come to understand they knew what she was doing with the paintings and didn\u2019t want to stop her, because these last three she set up much closer to the camera.  I was still squinting and studying the painting closely when I realized the flipped up seats in the next row up had brass number plates along the front edge of the seats.  Though they were upside down from the viewpoint of the painting, the angle was good enough that once I noticed them I was able to read them.  \n\n**2\u202643\u202626\u202689**\n\nI didn\u2019t understand any of it, but I committed it all to memory, focusing all my attention on the painting until she finally took it away.  Even that early on I could tell painting was taking a lot out of her now, and like I had for so long, I found myself talking to her, telling her to go rest before I remembered her body in the next room.  I almost stopped then, but no.  Maybe she couldn\u2019t tell I was talking to her, or maybe she could.  Either way, me talking to her couldn\u2019t hurt, and it made me feel a little less lonely and sad as I watched her.\n\nThe second painting, the one she started after I woke up from falling asleep for a few hours, was stranger than the rest.  It looked like it was in a room with curved walls made of tree roots, and in the center of the room was a little table made out of the same stuff.  Some of the roots around the room were a deep red, but other parts, including the table thing, looked burned and black.  I looked closer and saw that I could see a person\u2019s shadow over the table\u2014hands holding some long oval-shaped bundle.\n\nI studied it for a long time, going over it again and again in my mind after she took it away.  I couldn\u2019t make sense of it.  Of any of it.  I wasn\u2019t smart enough, and I was failing her.\n\nRachel slept for a long time after that painting.  Then she got up on the fifth day, her last day, and immediately started working again.  This time she was painting faster, and while I saw her wince occasionally, she never lost her look of determination as she slashed lines and colors across the canvas.  When she was done, Rachel picked up the painting and turned it toward the camera, giving me a small, tired smile as she was blocked from view.\n\nIt was looking out from the front porch of a house somewhere.  It was out in the country, and the morning view of the yard and the land beyond were wonderful, but closer-up the painting was of two hands.  Holding onto each other tightly, their interlocked fingers seemed to glow red and orange in the light of the rising sun.  I found myself crying as I looked at it.  \n\nPart of it was because I didn\u2019t know what it meant, and I felt a growing sense of desperation at the thought that Rachel\u2019s last works might be wasted on me.  Part was because I knew it had been five days, and I could sense I was close to the end.  To her end.\n\nBut there was something more to it than all that too.  The last painting\u2026even with everything else in my head and my heart pulling me down\u2026gave me hope.  Hope of what, I didn\u2019t know.  But I started to think that maybe the only message Rachel had for me in that last painting was that somehow, somewhere, everything would be okay.\n\nOutside the edge of the painting I could see motion in the room.  People hurriedly coming in with some kind of medical equipment.  And then the monitor went black.\n\n****\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done well, Thomas.  Very, very well.  For the last five days of video, we had charted one thousand and forty-seven microvariations in Rachel\u2019s behavior that we believed might correspond to your behavior, your reactions, and your emotional states while watching the video.  Like before, the two of you remained in sync as though you were in the same room.  It really is remarkable.\u201d\n\nI sat staring at Solomon.  I listened to what he said, but I didn\u2019t care.  I just wanted it over.  Whatever this was, I just wanted it over.\n\nClearing his throat, he went on.  \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve decided to move the implant from Rachel\u2019s body to your own.  That\u2019s one of the many reasons we\u2019ve preserved her so.  The foreign body was still showing signs of life all this time, but just barely, and we were afraid to attempt removal.  Our hope is that, given your connection to Rachel, it will accept you.  Perhaps even thrive in you more than it ever did our girl.\u201d\n\nI was suddenly on my feet, and it was only the raising of Solomon\u2019s gun that stopped me from attacking him.  \u201cDon\u2019t you fucking talk about her like that.  Like any of you gave a shit about her.  I\u2019ll fucking kill you.\u201d\n\nSolomon\u2019s face darkened slightly as his lips thinned.  \u201cNo, you won\u2019t.  But if idle threats make you feel better, go ahead.  It will only make things harder, not easier.\u201d\n\nFeeling a stab of panicked fear, I sat back down.  \u201cWhat is this thing you\u2019re going to put in me?\u201d\n\nThe man looked at me for several seconds before responding.  \u201cI\u2019m tempted not to tell you after your stupid\u2014and frankly, hurtful\u2014outburst.  But I\u2019ll be the bigger person.\u201d  Letting out a small sigh, he went on.  \u201cThomas, somewhere there is a tree.  A very special tree.  We suspect it is the same tree that Rachel painted for you that time, though we cannot say for sure, as we have never been able to find it.  It is either hidden away very well or it is able to hide itself from those it wishes.\u201d\n\nI just looked at him, trying to kill him by just wanting it to be so.  \u201cIn any case, we have the next best thing.  An ancient clipping from the tree.  Secured at great cost and sacrifice, and studied for a long time without much success.  We have, however, in recent years been given\u2026advice, that this clipping could be grown in the right soil.  We thought that soil was Rachel, but while it did develop further inside of her, she died before the necessary growth was finished.\u201d\n\nLeaning forward, he smiled at me.  \u201cWe have it on fairly good authority, however, that you might succeed where she failed.\u201d\n\n****\n\nI fought them when they came, but it didn\u2019t matter.  I woke up some time later with a dull ache in my chest and a small, already healing scar on my upper stomach.  I didn\u2019t really feel that different other than the little bit of pain, but I knew that would change with time.  Maybe I had more time than Rachel, or maybe I had less.  It didn\u2019t matter.  I just\u2026\n\n*Wait, what was that?*\n\nThere was some kind of soft voice\u2026coming from where?  It wasn\u2019t in the room.  It was in my head.  I felt a thrill of excitement.  Maybe this was Rachel\u2019s voice.  She had somehow stayed in the tree thing they had put inside me?\n\nBut no.  I had never heard Rachel\u2019s voice, but I sensed this wasn\u2019t it.  This voice was too delicate to really be heard or understood, and it reminded me of music coming from a distant room that you felt in the back of your mind without realizing it.  It was a\u2026a melody, a kind of song.  But it wasn\u2019t Rachel\u2019s song.  I realized with a shiver that it was the song of the thing inside of me.\n\nAt first I was afraid, but that didn\u2019t last long.  It wasn\u2019t trying to hurt me.  It was trapped here just like I was.  *But*, it started to sing, *it was time for us to be free.*\n\nI stood up and walked to the door, and as I did so, the lights went out.  The door in front of me clicked, and when I reached out and turned the knob in the dark, it opened easily.  How was this possible?  And if it could do this, why hadn\u2019t it helped Rachel get out?  There was no answer, but there was also no time.  I could already hear boots around the corner as the glow from flashlights began to light up the far end of the hall.  \n\nThey would drag me back in there.  Chain me up or take this thing back out of me before we could get away.  If I was ever going to get out, it had to be now.  The voice was singing again, pushing me to go further into the dark, to run until we were safe.\n\nSo I listened and I ran.\n\n****\n\nEvery door unlocked for me, every turn kept me barely out of sight.  The people looking for me were barking orders over a radio, asking someone what was the hold up on the generator kicking on.  Whatever the response, the hallways stayed dark as I drifted through them blind but not falling, lost but not being found.  \n\nWhen I reached the final door, I opened it into a bright afternoon.  My lungs burned a little at the first fresh, unrecycled air I had breathed in a week.  Blinking, I waited for the voice to tell me where to go, but it had fallen silent.  I closed the door as panic began to rise in my chest.  All this and I would get caught because I didn\u2019t know where to go.  I was outside a plain brown building in the middle of nowhere.  There was a road going off to the right, and to the left there was\u2026\n\n*Rachel\u2019s forest, from her first painting to me.*\n\nI knew it was the same forest immediately, and not just because of it matching the painting so closely.  I had some strange sense that felt like a kind of magnetism, or how birds know which way to fly.  Looking around for a second, I felt like I was being pulled when I looked again at those woods.  This was right.  Somehow, I knew this was the way I needed to go.\n\nSo I went.\n\nI had made it to the edge of the forest when I heard the noise of men coming outside the building.  I thought about hiding, but I knew it was a bad idea.  They would just catch me, and I felt a drive to go deeper into the woods.  I plunged ahead, running at close to a reckless speed but never tripping or stumbling as I went.  I would occasionally hear a noise behind me as they spread out to search, but the sounds grew fainter as I ran.  I almost thought I had lost them for good when I heard a short cough that was quickly muffled off to my left.  Someone had gotten close without me knowing it. \n\nPanicking, I looked for any places I could hide.  There were only bushes and trees and\u2026over there.  A well.  Not just *a* well, but Rachel\u2019s well, with the same worn, grey stone walls capped with a weathered wooden lid.  I felt a moment of happy recognition, but then it faded away.  How did that help?  They\u2019d check the well if they found it, and I didn\u2019t have any way to get down in it without getting hurt or stuck.  Then an idea stuck me.\n\nCrouching low and staying to the brush, I moved to the well and gingerly pushed on the lid.  At first it resisted, but when I pushed a bit harder, the wooden circle slid aside enough that you could clearly see someone moved it.  Glancing around, I eased back into the bushes as I heard soft footfalls approaching.\n\n\u201cWe need to check this out.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think he went down the well?  Better hope not.  He probably broke his neck if he did, and then its our asses.\u201d\n\nI could see the two men approaching.  Both of them were wearing dark body armor and carried assault rifles.  The older of the two shrugged back at the other one.  \u201cBetter that than he was hiding in there and we *didn\u2019t* check.\u201d\n\nLooking irritated, the younger man nodded.  \u201cI\u2019ll look.\u201d  He went over to the well and shoved the wooden lid aside, causing it to clatter to the ground.  Hitting a button on his rifle, a flashlight sprang to life on the barrel.  He started to shine it down into the well as the other continued to look in every direction.  I was worried he would see me if I moved, but I couldn\u2019t wait.  I just had to stay calm.  Think slow and move fast.\n\nI kept expecting to hear them yell, or feel something or someone strike me in the back, but nothing came.  As the afternoon light began to dim, I saw the trees thinning ahead.  I was approaching a road.  It looked like a normal, public road too, with several cars passing one way or the other as I walked out of the forest and up the hill to the asphalt.\n\nThe idea of hitchhiking, especially this close to where they held me, was frightening, but I saw little choice.  I was wearing sweatpants and a t-shirt they had given me and my own shoes, but I had no money or ID or phone.  My only chance was to get far enough away that I could try and get help.\n\nI jumped slightly at the hiss of hydraulic brakes as a large semi rolled to a stop next to me.  The passenger window rolled down and an older man with white hair and a greying mustache leaned over and peered down at me.  \n\n\u201cYou look lost, son.  You need a ride?\u201d\n\nI looked down at the door of the truck.  It had a logo that said \u201cMartinez and Sons Construction and Hauling\u201d  Below it was a cartoon man hitting a wall with a sledgehammer.  Looking back up, I smiled at him.\n\n\u201cYes sir, I do.\u201d\n\n****\nI woke up five hours later as we pulled into a truck stop somewhere in Nevada.  I had planned on staying awake the entire trip, but that had only lasted a few minutes before exhaustion overtook me.  I glanced over at Oliver Martinez and he gave me a toothy grin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired, but you were plumb tuckered out.  I\u2019ve got to fuel up, shower and get some grub.  I\u2019m going on to California after that.  If you want to ride further, just be back here in an hour.  Sound good?\u201d\n\nI nodded and thanked him again for the ride as I got out.  I felt groggy from sleeping, but otherwise okay.  I just needed to decide whether this was a good spot to ask for help or if I should ride with Martinez further.  He seemed like a very nice guy, and he would probably try to help if he could, but I wanted to avoid putting more people in danger if I could help it.  Looking around, I saw we were in a fairly nice little town.  I decided I would go look around for a few minutes and then decide what to do.\n\nI was only three blocks down the street when I saw the flickering lights in the distance.  It was a movie theater.  As I got closer, I felt my chest tightening.  It was the one from Rachel\u2019s painting.\n\n****\n\n\u201cHey there.  Welcome to the Phoenix.\u201d\n\nThe guy standing at the candy counter of the theater looked a little younger than me, and while he seemed friendly enough, he also looked slightly concerned.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re here for the horror double-feature, I\u2019m afraid the second movie is about thirty minutes in.  I can give you a half-rate if you want to see it though.\u201d\n\nI shook my head and tried to not look as strange and crazy as I felt.  \u201cNo, that\u2019s okay.  I\u2026well, I recognized this place from a picture a friend of mine painted.  So I came in to ask if you knew anything about her.\u201d\n\nHe raised his eyebrows and shrugged.  \u201cOkay, weird.\u201d  He smiled and added, \u201cWeird but interesting.  Who is she?\u201d\n\nI swallowed.  \u201cHer name is\u2026well, it was, Rachel Donovan.\u201d\n\nI expected him to look surprised or excited or angry, but I could see right away the name meant nothing to him.  Shaking his head, he shrugged again.  \u201cSorry, that doesn\u2019t ring a bell.  I\u2019d say you could ask the owner, but he\u2019s on vacation this week.\u201d\n\nNodding, I searched my mind for something else to ask, some way to make this place matter the way her other paintings had.  \u201cIs there anything unique about this place then?  Its history or something?\u201d\n\nThe man grinned.  \u201cBuddy, you\u2019re clearly not from here.  This place is super boring.  Not just the theater, but the whole town.\u201d  Frowning in thought, he added.  \u201cThe only thing I know about the history of this place is that there used to be a house here that burned down.  This was like in the 1920s or 30s when this wasn\u2019t even a part of town.  Couldn\u2019t tell you the first thing about it beyond that, but I still bet it\u2019s the most interesting thing that\u2019s ever happened here.\u201d\n\nI let out a disappointed sigh.  \u201cOkay.  Well, thanks.\u201d  I turned to leave when the guy called out again.\n\n\u201cHey man, sorry I couldn\u2019t help more.  If you come back, I\u2019ll get you a discount on a movie.  Half-off.  If I\u2019m not working, tell them Marshall said it was okay.\u201d\n\nI waved and tried to smile as I headed for the door with a heavy heart.  Why did you lead me here, Rachel?  What\u2019s here that will help?\n\nI was outside again, staring up at the theater\u2019s bright blinking signs as though they were going to give me some kind of secret signal, when I noticed movement out of the corner of my eye.  There was an alley that ran along side the theater and went behind it to\u2026something.  Whatever was back there, the light of a distant security lamp cast shadows along the wall of the alley, and those shadows were moving.\n\nInstead of feeling afraid, I felt excited as I started down the alley.  Rachel had led me here, and I just had to trust that there was a reason for it.  Keep looking until I\u2026\n\nThe shadows were made by leaves blowing in some wind I couldn\u2019t feel.  As I got to the far end of the alley, I saw there was a small back yard behind the theater surrounded by a chain link fence, and on the other side of that fence was the tree from Rachel\u2019s painting, with its deep red twisting bark and foam of green leaves waving to and fro in the night air.\n\nI felt a surge of warmth in my chest as the distant singing began again.  This was the place.  The special tree that could not be found unless it wanted you to find it.  It sat at the edge of a small overgrown lot surrounded on all sides by buildings and yards, somehow forgotten when whatever this land had once been was divided up, and despite its location, I had a strong sense that I was the first to see it in a very long time.\n\nClimbing the fence, I felt a jagged wire dig into my leg and rip my pants as I fell over the top.  I was bleeding a little, but I hardly noticed.  I could smell the tree now, and it was a rich, good smell unlike any I had smelled before.  Reaching out to it, I felt the singing grow louder as I touched it.  I felt stronger and less afraid then, and when I saw the light opening up at its roots, I didn\u2019t tremble, I smiled.\n\nThere was a hidden tunnel under the tree.  A tunnel filled with sweet-smelling air that was like the tree smell but also different.  And the tunnel wasn\u2019t dark\u2014no, not at all.  It glowed with its own golden light that called to me, urged me forward.  Rain was beginning to fall as I looked around the dark lot.  I had the thought that I was leaving this world behind.\n\nAnd I found I didn\u2019t mind that much at all.\n\nThe tunnel had continued to grow, slanting down gently and tall enough that I walked in without stooping.  The roots of the tree went on and on, woven through the dirt walls as I went deeper.  I looked back and saw the tunnel had closed behind me, but I wasn\u2019t surprised.  The way forward was the only way that mattered.\n\nI walked for what might have been hours, but I never felt tired or hungry.  And I never worried I was lost, though I had no idea where I was or where I was going.  Still, I felt a surge of happiness and excitement when I turned a corner and saw something in the tunnel ahead.  As I got closer I realized it was a brick wall, but just as I began to think I had found a dead end, the wall faded away, revealing a dark room.\n\nI paused at the edge of the tunnel, looking out at the floor of what looked like a basement.  It was empty, but in the light from the tree I could make out something scratched into the floor.  It was the number two.  I felt my pulse quicken as I thought back to Rachel\u2019s painting with the theater seats, and then I stepped out into the room.\n\nIt was the empty basement of a house, and as I went up the stairs and opened the door, I saw that the rest of the house was empty as well.  No lights were on, but bright sunlight poured in through every window and in the distance I could hear what sounded like small waves crashing on a beach.  I wanted to go out and see where I was, but I forced myself to check the house first for any people or clues.  But there were none.  The house was utterly bare of any sign of people other than the number scratched into the floor below.\n\nMy nose tingled with salty air as I stepped outside.  The house was near the beach on what I soon figured out was a small, deserted island, and I realized with little surprise that I recognized the house from Rachel\u2019s painting.  As I stepped off the porch, I saw no signs of people, but I wasn\u2019t entirely alone.  Because sitting some distance from the house, was the tree.  \n\nI knew it couldn\u2019t be the same tree as in the abandoned lot, but at the same time I knew that it was.  Or at least a different part of the same tree that made the tunnels and appeared in my old world and whatever place this was.  \n\nBecause I had started having that thought as soon as I stepped out of the house.  I didn\u2019t think this was my world.  Not exactly.  I could see a larger island some distance away, and it might have people on it.  Hotels and cars and planes.  Or it might not, as those things might not exist here.  Either way, my newfound intuition was growing stronger, and I could tell that the\u2026what was it called?  The con\u2026no, the texture of things was different somehow, if only a little.  Not bad or scary, just different.\n\nStill, after a couple of hours exploring the island and checking the house, I began to feel terribly lonely, even with the tree nearby.  I decided to go back into the tunnel and keep going.  The basement wall faded away as I walked up to it, and I entered the tunnels again.\n\nIt was only a short time later that I found my second version of the house.  Much like the first, the wall faded away into a basement, but this one was far from empty.  It was a workshop of some kind, full of tools I wasn\u2019t familiar with.  I glanced down and saw \u201c43\u201d scratched onto the floor.  Who was doing that?  And why?\n\nI was going to explore the house, more carefully this time, as it looked like there were people here, but then I froze.  Propped against the brick wall, next to a small stack of boards, was a sledgehammer.  Trying to be quiet, I crept over and picked it up before heading back into the tunnel.\n\n****\n\nWhen I was little, before Daddy died, he had loved to hunt.  I never went with him and didn\u2019t remember much of what he hunted, but I do know he had an old hound he\u2019d had since before I was born.  The dog had only loved him\u2014well, him and being on the trail of something.  When Rocker (his name was Rockerfeller) got a scent, it was like he was in a trance.  He would go and go, this way and that, and to look at him, it looked like he was having a fit\u2014both lost and certain at the same time.  But whatever Rocker knew or didn\u2019t know, he always found what he was looking for. \n\nI felt like Rocker now.  I was moving faster and faster as I went down this turn and that.  I felt like I was on the trail of something or traveling on memories I didn\u2019t have.  Gripping the sledgehammer tightly, I could hear the rising hum of the distant music in my head as I turned the last corner, and then it fell silent.\n\nThere was another brick wall, and as I approached, it fell away.\n\nIt was another basement room, but this one was much smaller.  It contained a table, a clothes chest, and an old metal bed that had been broken apart.  At the far brick wall, a woman was using one of the metal legs from the bed to attack the wall and whatever lay behind it.  I felt my head began to swim as I looked at her from behind, and as she turned to look at me, eyes wide with surprise and fear, I felt the sledgehammer slip from my grip as I stumbled back against the now solid wall.  I could barely breathe at all, but I managed to get out a single word.\n\n\u201cRachel?\u201d\n\nThe woman looked at me, her expression less fearful but still guarded.  She had the bed leg partially raised in warning.  [\u201cYeah?  Do I know you?\u201d](https:\/\/redd.it\/8uj33q)\n\n****\n \n**** \n\n**** \n\n**** \n\n\n\n\nIt was her, but it wasn\u2019t, much like the tree on the island.  This Rachel looked a few years older, and while she looked stressed and confused at the moment, her eyes didn\u2019t seem weighted down by the same quiet sadness I had come to recognize watching the other Rachel for all that time.  Still, I didn\u2019t know how to answer her question and not sound creepy or crazy.  I stared at her for a second, floundering, when she asked another.\n\n\u201cYou came out of the tree tunnel, right?\u201d\n\nI nodded, grateful for something I could answer easily.\n\nStudying me, she said.  \u201cWhere did you come from?  Before the tunnel I mean.\u201d\n\nI flushed as I tried to think of the right words.  \u201cUm, well, I came from Texas.  Originally I mean.\u201d\n\nShe grinned at me for a second before catching herself and trying to look serious again.  \u201cYeah, okay.  But like\u2026do you know how the tree works?  How did you find out about the tunnel?  How did you get here?\u201d\n\nSighing, I rubbed my head and just started into it.\n\n\u201cLook, I know this will sound crazy, but I had a job watching a woman trapped in a room, and that woman was you, or another version of you, and she asked me for help, and I couldn\u2019t help her and then they took me, and I found out she had been dead for a long time but could see me in the future and then they put something from the tree in me that had been in her that killed her and then I escaped and then I figured out where to go to find the tree from things she had painted and I somehow knew how to go in the tunnels to find different spots, and I\u2019m pretty sure the tunnels lead to different worlds and I got this sledgehammer and then I\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cHold up.  God damn.  Take a breath.  You\u2019re going to pass out.\u201d  She was smiling again, and this time she didn\u2019t try to hide it.  She looked over what was left of the bed to where the sledgehammer was laying on the floor.  \u201cAnd did you say sledgehammer?\u201d\n\n****\n\n**Whack**\n\n\u201cSo yeah, I believe you.\u201d\n\n**Whack**\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in those tunnels too.  My ex-boyfriend tricked me into moving here so he could tie me to the tree in his place.\u201d\n\n**Whack** \n\n\u201cWell, not tie me to the tree literally.  Take his place as\u2026what?  The tree\u2019s buddy or something?  I don\u2019t really know.  It\u2019s all pretty fucked up and I don\u2019t understand all of it.\u201d\n**Whack**\n\n\u201cBut what I do understand is that the fucker walled me up in here.  At first, I thought I could just pry loose some bricks over time, but nope.  He put a layer of concrete on the outside this time.  Good ol\u2019 Phil.  Or Justin.  Or whatever.  I mainly think of him as Fuckface now.\u201d\n\n**Whack**\n\n\u201cThis is taking forever.\u201d\n\nI stepped up and put my hand on the sledgehammer.  \u201cLet me do it for a bit.  We can take turns.\u201d  We had cleared away even more brick than she had already managed, but the concrete wall was only starting to show small cracks.  I wanted to just keep looking at her, have her talk to me, but I knew she was tired.  She nodded reluctantly and let go of the hammer.  Before I swung, I looked back at her.  \u201cHow long have you been in here like this?\u201d\n\n**Whack** \n\nRachel scowled.  \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say for sure, but I think about eight months.\u201d\n\nI let the hammer drop down again as my eyes widened.  \u201cHow did you survive all that time?\u201d\n\nHer scowl deepened.  \u201cIt\u2019s the tree.  It won\u2019t let me die.  I just dip into the tunnel every day for a bit and I never get that hungry or thirsty.\u201d\n\nA thought occurred to me then.  \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just escape through the tunnels?\u201d\n\nShe quickly shook her head.  \u201cNo, thank you.  I\u2019ve had enough of seeing other worlds.  Some of them aren\u2019t so nice.  And I don\u2019t want to be more tied to the tree than I already am.  I just want out of here, into my own world, and then I can try and figure out how to get free of my connection to the tree for good.\u201d  Rachel shrugged.  \u201cI would have done it eventually with the stupid bed parts, but who knows how long it would have taken?\u201d  She smiled again.  \u201cI\u2019m very happy you came to help and brought a sledgehammer with you.\u201d\n\nReturning her smile, I nodded as I lifted the hammer again.  \u201cMe too.\u201d\n\n**Whack**\n\n****\n\nWe were both wringing with sweat when we crawled through the hole we\u2019d made in the outer wall.  Rachel told me that she thought her ex-boyfriend was long gone, but she couldn\u2019t be sure, so we had to be careful.  Grabbing the sledgehammer from inside the room, we made our way toward the stairs.\n\nThe house was decorated but quiet, and we saw no sign of anyone as we walked to the front door and opened it.  Outside, the sun was coming up on a new day, and as we walked out onto the porch, I jumped a little as Rachel took my hand and gave it a squeeze.  I looked over at her.  \n\nI hadn\u2019t been able to help the other Rachel, but maybe that had never been the point at all.  Because I thought now she had been able to see more than just other places or the future.  She had been able to see into other worlds and possibilities. \n\nLike this one, where another version of her was trapped and needed help.  A place where I wouldn\u2019t be hunted and she could be free.  In the end, even when she knew she was dying, Rachel had been determined to help us be together and happy.\n\nThe morning sun painted beautiful colors on Rachel\u2019s face, and looking into her eyes I saw how much she was like the woman I had watched and cared about and tried to save.  The woman who, in the end, had saved me instead.  I wanted to tell Rachel so many things, ask her so many questions, but all that could come later.  Squeezing her hand back, I walked with her away from the house.\n\n[For now, this was enough.](https:\/\/redd.it\/bue253)\n\n****\n\n[You have a delivery scheduled.](https:\/\/redd.it\/cbn7uj)\n\n[The Ghost Tree](https:\/\/redd.it\/kfvzse)"},"248":{"title":"We\u2019ve been stuck in construction traffic for 8 hours now.

The last guy who got out was shot in the legs and then run over by a tank.\n\nWe set out yesterday from Gainesville, Florida, where Lauren had recently graduated from law school. We were moving to my home state of Maine, to start a permanent life together. The drive was beautiful most of the way, and Lauren and I spent a lot of time on speaker phone with each other to comment on it. A couple of times we passed through rain, and once a really wild thunderstorm that lit up the whole sky for miles. Then, about 8 hours ago, we hit a traffic jam on I-95 just outside of Lewiston, Maine.\n\nI took a look at the navigation thing on my phone, but it didn\u2019t show any red areas of heavy delay. It also had some trouble showing my exact location, though, so I lit a cigarette and figured it would just be a few minutes.\n\nAfter about fifteen minutes, I called Lauren. \u201cHow\u2019s it going back there?\u201d I asked. In the background, I could hear the cats going nuts.\n\n\u201cNot great,\u201d said Lauren. \u201cDo you hear Hankie and Hattie howling? They started up as soon as we stopped. What's going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cMust be an accident that just happened. My phone usually gives a heads up if there\u2019s planned construction or something.\u201d I heard one of the cats hiss while the other one yowled.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so tired,\u201d said Lauren.\n\n\u201cI know, me too. Let\u2019s stop and get something to eat once we\u2019re through, yeah?\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright. Love you. Sorry about the cats.\u201d\n\n\u201cLove you,\u201d said Lauren.\n\nI hung up and tried to get something on the radio. I have a base model 2006 Toyota Tundra, so no AUX jack, and the CD player had broken years ago. During the entire trip, I had been at the mercy of radio stations, and for the most part, they didn\u2019t do much for me other than create a general atmosphere of annoyance.\n\nNow, though, I couldn't even keep the radio on. What wasn't warbling static was some kind of distorted robotic voice reading off a list of numbers and random words strung together. Across the whole radio band, same thing. I couldn't take it so I shut it off.\n\nI picked my phone back up and went to check Twitter. All I got was that game where you have to jump the dinosaur over cacti faster and faster and then it gets dark out and the birds come. No internet. Finally, Twitter did half-load, so there was *some* intermittent reception there, barely.\n\nAfter a half hour had passed, I started to get antsy, and so did everyone else. People were sticking their heads out the window to try to see what was going on, but it was no use. The line of cars seemed endless. A few people got out of their vehicles to try to get a better look. I got out too and started walking to Lauren\u2019s car.\n\nWhen I was halfway there, a voice cut into the air. It sounded like someone shouting through a bullhorn. \u201cReturn immediately to your vehicles! No one is permitted to be outside! This is your only warning. If you do not heed it, there will be severe consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cWha da *fuck* is goin\u2019 on?!\u201d some guy shouted in a thick Boston accent; he was standing a few car lengths in front of me. An instant later, he was down on the ground, not moving. I didn\u2019t see what happened exactly, but that was enough to make me to hustle back to my truck.\n\nI tried calling Lauren again. When she answered all that I could hear were broken flashes of the cats screaming and Lauren sounding scared and begging to know what was happening.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, not sure that she could hear it. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re searching for a criminal or something. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Then we were disconnected.\n\nA minute later, an ambulance was wailing its way down the right hand shoulder. It stopped just past my truck, and two EMTs jumped out of the back. They closed the doors behind them, but I saw that there was somebody else in there. Somebody dressed in riot gear, holding a big gun.\n\nThe EMTs dragged the guy with the Boston accent by the arms over to the ambulance. They opened the doors and sort of tossed him in, and then followed behind. I saw the riot gear person again for a second, and then the doors slammed shut and the ambulance sped off down the shoulder out of sight.\n\nSomebody four cars ahead of me got the idea to follow the ambulance out of there. I watched as a red Hyundai Sonata with a New Jersey license plate tore into the shoulder lane and sped after the ambulance.\n\nI tried calling Lauren to ask her if she thought we should try it too. It was a ballsy move for sure, but she had sounded at the end of her rope stuck in there with our wailing cats, so I thought she might be willing to give it a shot. This time, the call didn\u2019t even go through.\n\nI was getting ready to try calling again when I heard this loud blast. A puff of smoke blossomed somewhere up ahead, and all of a sudden, there were chunks of a car flying through the air. A red car. Very likely a red Hyundai Sonata.\n\nAs I watched a flaming tire roll to a stop against the highway divider, I decided not to replicate New Jersey\u2019s maneuver.\n\nI heard the blast of a horn behind me, and looked in the rearview to see that Lauren had her arm out the window, moving her hand around in a circle. Finally, it hit me that she was telling me to roll down my window, so that\u2019s what I did.\n\n\u201cCan you hear me?\u201d she shouted.\n\n\u201cI can!\u201d I could even hear the cats. They sounded really freaked out.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening?!\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know baby! I think we\u2019re in some kind of military lockdown maybe! I think we have to just sit tight here.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you throw me a bottle?\u201d asked Lauren.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cA bottle! Like Gatorade or something. I know that you\u2019ve probably got ten of them in your front seat.\n\nIt was true. Not ten exactly, but close enough. I just threw all of my trash on the seat of my truck until it started overflowing, whereas Lauren kept her car clean. \u201cWhat are you going to do with the bottle?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNot something I want to shout out for the whole world to hear!\u201d said Lauren. \u201cLet\u2019s just say we\u2019ve been here a while and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re coming to a rest stop soon enough.\u201d\n\nFinally, I understood. I reached over and grabbed a bottle. I chucked it out the window, but it was a bad throw, and bounced off the hood of Lauren\u2019s Honda. I tried again, and this time she caught it. She rolled up her window and in the rearview mirror I watched her fuss around as she presumably tried to pee into the thing.\n\nThis was when the fleet of massive trucks started rolling in, on the southbound side of the highway divide. Some of them had cranes sitting on long flat beds, and others had big chunks of some kind of metal material. Soon, the southbound side was jammed up with these giant trucks and their haul. Then they started to get to work.\n\n\u201cWhat are they doing?!\u201d asked Lauren. She\u2019d opened her window back up. \u201cAre they\u2026 building a fucking *wall*?!\u201d\n\nThat is exactly what it looked like they were doing. One crane would take a massive chunk of material, and lift it into place either next to, or on top of, another chunk.\n\n\u201cYes! They\u2019re walling us in!\u201d I shouted. I checked my phone for the thousandth time. I had a bar, and used it to call 911.\n\nA lady answered. \u201cWhat is the address for this emergency?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026 uh\u2026 I-95 northbound, just before Lewiston, Maine. I forget the exit number we were coming up on. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay. What is the emergency?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2026 we\u2019re in this weird traffic jam\u2026 and\u2026 people are dying here. Cars are exploding. They\u2019re building a wall around us. They\u2019re trapping us here. I know that sounds crazy\u2026.\u201d\n\nThere was a long silence on the other end. I thought maybe we\u2019d been disconnected. But then I heard her voice again, crystal clear.\n\n\u201cSir, I am going to need you to remain calm and stay in your vehicle. And if you would, roll down your window. Not the driver\u2019s side, the passenger\u2019s side.\u201d\n\n\u201cW\u2026 what?\u201d I asked. Then I heard the tapping at my window. There was a lady cop standing there, holding a cell phone up to her ear. My heart jumped up into my throat, and my instinct was to slam my foot on the gas pedal, but there was nowhere to go. I rolled down the window.\n\n\u201cYou reported an emergency?\u201d asked the cop. \u201cEverything looks okay to me. We don\u2019t discourage anyone from calling emergency services if they truly think that there might be an emergency situation occurring, but everything appears to be perfectly fine here. I will give you the benefit of the doubt this time, but remember that we also very strongly frown upon fraudulent 911 calls. You could be charged for that, sir. It\u2019s no joke.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d I said, trying to hold it together. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that. I *did* think that something bad was going on, but now I see that everything is okay. Thanks for checking in.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no problem at all, sir,\u201d said the cop, smiling. \u201cAnd remember: *stay in your vehicle*.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I said, trying to smile, though I\u2019m sure my face looked like a sweaty pretzel instead.\n\nThe cop nodded and then walked off down the line of cars. I waited a few minutes, and then called out to Lauren.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re fucked!\u201d I said. \u201cI called 911 and that cop that was just here? She\u2019s the one who picked up. She said everything\u2019s fine\u2026 but it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\n\u201cFuck!\u201d said Lauren. \u201cWhat do we do?!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when the guy jumped out of his car and made a break for the wooded area to the right of the highway. And that\u2019s when they shot him in the legs. I heard him cry out and watched him hit the ground. I heard a loud continuous rumble, interspersed with snaps from the woods. Then I saw the tank. It didn\u2019t so much emerge from the woods as it destroyed the woods in its wake. Beyond it, I saw another enormous wall. We were walled-in from two sides\u2026 and my guess was that we were walled-in from four sides.\n\nThe tank crushed the man like he was a particularly small ant.\n\n\\*\n\nThey are working on the roof now. It's almost done. Once the roof is on, I have a feeling that I won't get any reception at all. Before that happens, I'm hoping for one more spike so that I can get this post out.\n\nI don't know if this is on the news or not. I thought it was just a traffic jam, so that's probably how they're playing it off. They probably have rerouted traffic around us by now.\n\nI don't know what this is. But there are now dozens of heavily armed people in riot gear going from car to car. Sometimes they drag somebody out, and carry them screaming off to what remains of the wooded area, where they disappear from sight.\n\nThey're almost at my truck now. I hope they skip me, and Lauren. Oh God. I'm going to tell her that I love her.\n\nIf this reaches you, I don't know what you can do, but please try to help us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/bxoscy\/we_were_stuck_in_construction_traffic_for_8_hours\/)\n\n[Part 3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/byqo1k\/we_were_stuck_in_construction_traffic_for_8_hours\/)"},"249":{"title":"The Chernobyl disaster was a coverup of something terrifying","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/bz0dl9\/the_chernobyl_disaster_was_a_coverup_of_something\/","flair":"Series","author":"DELTA129","selftext":"Narrations:  \n\n\n[Mr. Creeps](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pylxyu24g1g)  \n\n[The Dark Somnium](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_rDRRXlCdC4)  \n\n**TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO KEEP DMing ME ID THE STORY IS TRUE**: Please see the description and nature of the subreddit where it is posted.\n  \n\n\n  \nYou probably heard about tourism in the Chernobyl exclusion zone. I\u2019ve been there myself several times. And it\u2019s nothing like what you see in games or horror movies. There are no ghosts, mutants or radioactive anomalies and death isn\u2019t waiting for you at every corner. Actually, I think it\u2019s one of the most peaceful and prettiest places on Earth. An example of strength of nature and how it can reverse the damage that we caused it.\n\nThus, when my friend Alexei decided to go there, he knew who to contact. He's a physics student and right now he\u2019s doing some kind of research on nuclear fallout and he said that he wanted to get some direct measurements and samples. But we both knew that it\u2019s just an excuse to go on an \u201cadventure\u201d. We visited the old powerplant, the abandoned city Pripyat and the surrounding exclusion zone. It was nice, but I would probably just bore you with more details. That part is not important anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe were driving on some dirt roads in a forest east of Pripyat when we found it. An old, rusty fence and a chained gate that blocked any further passage. There was a big sign with a radiation hazard symbol and captioned: \u201cRestricted area. Authorized personnel only\u201d.\n\nThere was a pair of massive metal blast doors in the side an artificially-looking hill not far behind the fence, with a large, white \u201cO-13\u201d painted on it and \u201cNO ENTRY\u201d sprayed on top.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think it is?\u201d Alex asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, looks like some kind of bunker,\u201d I replied. \u201cAnd it looks like it has been closed for some time,\u201d I added after taking a closer look at the doors. The both halves were welded shut in the center. Alex took his samples and readings, but we were too puzzled to leave just yet.\n\n\u201cDo you think we can get in?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWell not this way for sure. Even if it wasn\u2019t welded sealed, I\u2019m sure we have no way of unlocking it.\u201d Alex replied while examining the massive door.\n\n\u201cIt looks like an underground bunker. They must have had a way to pump air inside and I don\u2019t think this is it. There has to be another way to get in.\u201d I said.\n\nWe circled the main entrance to try find other means of entry. The day was already coming to an end and it was slowly getting darker. As we were searching, a thought crossed my mind.\n\nWhy would they weld the doors? What\u2019s so important inside that they went this far to keep people away?\n\n\u201cLook, there\u2019s something there,\u201d Alex pulled me away from my thoughts.\n\nIt was a concrete block a couple of meters large with what looked like vents on the sides. As I looked into the vents, I noticed that they were also sealed with heavy-looking steel hatches and no clear way to open them. However, there was also a somewhat smaller door labeled \u201cService tunnel\u201d with a large wheel on the outside.\n\n\u201cShould I open it?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m really wonder what this is. Anyway, we don\u2019t have to go in. At least we\u2019ll see if the door still works.\n\nAt first, the wheel wouldn\u2019t turn because of all the rust and dirt, but eventually it budged. The door unlocked. I pulled and it slowly started opening. It was very heavy and took a lot of force.\n\nBehind the door, there was a small platform and a tight vertical tunnel with a ladder. What caught my attention was that there was an identical locking mechanism on the inside. That meant that they could lock the door from both sides. But why? We were lucky, because if they had locked it from the inside too, there would be no way to get in.\n\nI stepped inside and shined my phone light down the shaft. It wasn\u2019t strong enough to hit the bottom. The air was damp and old and there was something that I couldn\u2019t identify. A very faint, chemical-like smell. There was no radiation nor signs of any other hazards.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me. This is so cool. We have to come back here and check it out later.\u201d Alex said.\n\nI couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\nIt was almost dark now, so we resealed the door and called it a day. But we promised ourselves to return.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI immediately tried to do some research when I got home, unfortunately with no success. I even tried to call Pavel, a friend of mine who knew the area better than me. Actually, it was him who brought me there for the first time. He couldn\u2019t help me either, but promised to ask around. I told him about our plan and asked if he wouldn\u2019t go with us, but unfortunately, he was out of the country for a while.\n\nA week later, we packed our gear and went on with it. We brought some rope, heavy flashlights, glowsticks, Geiger counters, waterproof protective clothes, an oxygen meter and a small emergency scuba tank just in case. And yeah, we\u2019re not stupid so we told our relatives and friends about our trip and when we\u2019re expecting to return.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe closed the door behind us as we descended down the access shaft. We couldn\u2019t know what\u2019s down there and we didn\u2019t want to cause a radiation leak or something like that. We eventually dropped down into a concrete tunnel which enclosed the air vents and some smaller pipes. There was obviously no power and thus no lights. Good thing we brought our own.\n\nWe followed the tunnel and reached another door, but this time it was a regular one, not the heavy bunker-type. We went through and entered a room with 4 large air pumps and some electrical equipment and controls. The ventilation shafts split here into two larger ones that ran straight into ground and two smaller ones that went straight across the room where there was another set of doors.\n\nBehind the doors, there was a large hall with numerous boxes, crates and other cargo just laying around. There also was a security checkpoint. Behind the checkpoint, we found the main door that we have seen from the outside. Just next to it, there was some heavy lifting equipment. We returned through the checkpoint and taken a look at a set of elevators. There was a simple map with the layout of the facility floor by floor. We were on floor 0, main entry hall. There were another 4 floors below us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFloor -1: Offices, security and recreation\n\nFloor -2: Secure laboratories\n\nFloor -3: Accelerator, Cleanroom decontamination chamber\n\nFloor -4: Experiment site\n\nThe map was titled \u201cObject-13\u201d. It wasn\u2019t a military bunker. This was a research site.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe took a set of stairs, since the elevators were of no use without power. An unsettling thought brushed my mind as we were descending. They probably were moving some supplies, and then left them there and took the equipment to the main door. Were they trying to get out?\n\nI stepped on another stair step but something rolled away under my foot, lost my balance and fell on my back. My pack luckily absorbed the impact. I looked under my feet to see what caused my fall. Empty bullet casings.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the sole reason why I felt odd about this place. As soon as we got down to level -1, I noticed that every single door was open. Every single one. There was a canteen and a kitchen right at the beginning of a long rectangular corridor. Various offices surrounded the corridor. There was the regular stuff \u2013 paperwork, old computers, personal belongings, all right there where they left it. Did they leave in a hurry?\n\n\u201cDimitri!\u201d Alex called from, the canteen on the opposite side of the corridor.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d was all I could say when I followed him to the canteen.\n\nThere was food still neatly served on the tables. But it wasn\u2019t spoilt. It wasn\u2019t fresh either, but it wasn\u2019t decaying, as a 30-year-old meal should.\n\n\u201cHow is this possible?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe it was irradiated or something. But it\u2019s not anymore, I checked that. I really don\u2019t know man,\u201d he answered, as puzzled as I was.\n\nOh, why didn\u2019t we just turn back and leave? Now that I\u2019m writing this, there were so many red flags already. Something really wrong happened down there. But I guess we were too excited and curious. But it was at this point that my excitement started to fade and be replaced with an eerie feeling.\n\nNevertheless, we continued and descended down to level -2. The stairwell ended here, and to go deeper, we would have to cross the entire floor to reach an another one on the opposite side. There was a security checkpoint and a large blast door that we had to pass through to reach the labs. Again, every door was wide open. However, the things that people left here weren\u2019t neatly placed where they should have been. It was a mess everywhere. There were all kinds of rooms with all kinds of equipment that I didn\u2019t understand. Occasionally, there were more empty bullet casings on the ground. There still was the one central rectangular corridor as above, but the rooms around it were like a little maze.\n\nAlmost at the other side of the floor, we found the head scientist\u2019s office. As I said, everywhere it was a mess, but I found a logbook on the desk. There was only a handful of pages, the rest torn out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5. October 1984:** Today we successfully managed to translocate several atoms without changes in any physical properties. It\u2019s going to be a long road until we can transport solid objects, but we\u2019re going some good work here.\n\n**17. January 1985:** We\u2019ve managed to transport an apple today. However, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that the pattern of red and green skin on top was slightly different. But it was still the same apple, with the same structure, shape, everything. We also tried to transport some electronics. They were unharmed and in working order. I think that we still have a lot to perfect and learn about this technology, but we cannot slow down now. The country is relying on us.\n\n**21. February 1985:** After the animal trials, we translocated our first human today. He is alive and healthy, a brave hero of our nation. We have proven that this technology works now, but the practicality is still very limited due to the fixed translocation ratio. We still cannot \u201csend\u201d matter. Only exchange the positions of two equally massive objects. I have proposed a new type of device, that could possibly achieve one-way translocation of just a single object, but it would need an immense amount of energy.\n\n**1. May 1985:** Our superiors accepted my proposal. They are going to build a new, much bigger translocator here, in the power plant, so we can use a nuclear reactor as a direct power source. There is one more thing. We\u2019ve now translocated dozens of test subjects. Each one is alive and well, but sometimes they are a little bit, well, different. They sometimes claim that various events in the past happened differently than they really did. Sometimes they claim to know people who don\u2019t exist, or more alarming, they know people who they are not supposed to know. The following was written below with a pencil by hand: \u201cTest subject 28 was speaking an unknown language and couldn\u2019t understand any real language after the experiment.\u201d\n\nThere was a lot of missing pages afterwards.\n\n**25. April 1986:** We are going to try to change our approach. It\u2019s been more than a year, and we\u2019re still unsuccessful in eliminating the translocation symmetry anomaly. We still event don\u2019t know what is causing it, but we are not going to make any progress this way. Today, we are going to try to access the conduit reality instead.  Even though Unit 2 - the one we built in the power plant - is still new, we are going to use it for this experiment. Who knows what wonders are waiting for us on the other side?\n\nThere was one last page in the logbook. On it, it was just a single phrase, written again and again:\n\n# \u201cWE LET THEM IN\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cAlex, I think we should go,\u201d I called.\n\n\u201cMan, come take a look at this,\u201d he answered.\n\nI stepped out of the lab and back into the hallway.\n\nThere were \u2026 clothes all over the corridor. Well what was left of them. They were torn to shreds. No bodies, no blood, just strips of cloth and an occasional shoe or a watch.  I looked up and stared down the dark corridor in front of us. I just stood there for a while.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was, I don't know ... as if something torn all these people to shreds, and then cleaned it all up. Except the clothes and other non-organic material.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA wave of pure, instinctive dread washed over me. I couldn\u2019t move. I didn\u2019t even breathe.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just get out of here.\u201d Alex said.\n\nWe turned around and walked away. Slowly at first, but we quickened our pace. Our footsteps echoed across the underground structure.\n\n\u201cI just want to be out of here man. We shouldn\u2019t have done this\u201d Alex said. I didn\u2019t tell him about the logbook, but\u2026\n\nMy thoughts were cut short after a sudden realization.\n\nHis voice didn\u2019t echo. It was just our footsteps.\n\nI think he realized too, because we both stopped and listened.\n\nNothing. Just silence.\n\nI stepped forward.\n\n*Clack.*\n\nI took another step.\n\n*Clack.*\n\nThere was this door just in front of us and I forced myself to try something. I closed it behind us as we passed it and placed a glass beaker that I found on the ground on top.\n\nI took a step forward.\n\nSilence\n\nIt was just echo after all, I thought.\n\nWe walked away, carefully at first, but then we once again quickened our pace. We turned around a corner, and then it happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Crash*\n\nThe glass shattered.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSomeone\n\nor some thing\n\n&#x200B;\n\njust opened the door.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe dropped all our gear except our lights and ran as fast as we could. I didn\u2019t even know I could run this fast. I always tried to be a tough guy but I was never so scared in my life.\n\nOur footsteps didn\u2019t echo anymore. Or better said, they weren\u2019t in sync with ours anymore. Something was running after us. Each second it was getting closer. And closer.\n\nAs soon as we reached the security checkpoint, we started closing the door. The rusty joint of the door squealed in protest, but we pulled with all our strength. We almost had it closed, when we heard a loud, guttural and unnatural growl.\n\nThe door slammed shut and I threw the wheel to the \u2018locked\u2019 position. My heart was pounding so hard that it was all I heard for a while.\n\nNo, wait, it wasn\u2019t my heart. It was that thing, pounding on the locked blast door.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe were running again. We reached the stairwell and run up, taking 2-3 steps at once.\n\nWe finally reached the air pump room. The ascent really exhausted us and even though I was scared shitless, I felt like I would pass out if I took another step forward. Besides, we locked it down there.\n\nAlex sat down and leaned his back on one of the large vertical vents with a bang.\n\n*Bang. Bang. Bang\u2026*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh fuck.\n\nWe locked it down there.\n\nBut we forgot the vents.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlex and I looked at each other, our eyes met, and then\u2026 the vent burst and he was gone. I only heard him scream as he was dragged back down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel terrible for doing this, but I just ran, I climbed the service shaft and locked the service door shut when I was finally out of this hell.\n\nAs soon as I had phone service again, my phone started beeping with loads and loads of missed calls and messages from Pavel.\n\n\u201cHey Dimitri, I found this guy, he says he knows what \u2018O-13\u2019 is. Please pick up as soon as you can, he says it\u2019s dangerous and you should stay out of it.\n\n\u201cThis guy is calling me now, he sounds serious, please call me back at once\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on but he\u2019s going there, please I hope you get this before you go down. Stay safe friend.\u201d\n\nThere was also one message from an unknown number:\n\n\u201cDimitri, this is Anatoliy Moroz, I know what you found and I\u2019m on my way from Kiev now. DO NOT GO DOWN THERE. If you already did and you manage to get out, lock the door that you used to get in and make sure it stays locked. I will try to call you when I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo here I am, writing this while I wait. I do this to make sure that no one else repeats our mistake, since I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll live long to tell anyone personally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just can\u2019t leave Alex behind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have to go back.\n\n# [Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/c090ig\/the_chernobyl_disaster_was_a_coverup_of_something\/)"},"250":{"title":"My job is watching a woman trapped in a room.

I rolled back to the desk and sat there, trying to stop from shaking, trying to make myself take a breath.  Think about it slow.  The first thing was, should I hit a button?\n\nThe red button was for an emergency.  If she *was* a prisoner or something, and she was trying to escape, they might think that was an emergency.  But no one had been hurt that I knew of.  And I think Mr. Solomon meant save that for something that was like a police or ambulance emergency, not something like this.  But what about the green button?\n\nThis was definitely something \u201cnoteworthy\u201d.  Not only that she was asking for help, but that she was asking *me* for help.  \n\nI made myself stop for a moment.  I couldn\u2019t know for sure she was asking me.  I had gone to school with several boys named Thomas.  It was a common name.  But the chances of her painting that name when I was working here?  I didn\u2019t want to be silly, but I wasn\u2019t trying to be too\u2026what\u2019s that word.  Mom used to say it when she read her angel books.  Skeptics.  I didn\u2019t want to be a skeptic either.  I had to believe it was probably meant for me.  And that was something they would want to know.\n\nBut should I hit the green button?  My hands were drifting toward the metal box on the desk, but I hesitated.  I didn\u2019t like breaking rules, and I was scared of what would happen if I broke these.  If they really were holding her prisoner, then they were probably very bad people.  But I didn\u2019t know that.  Maybe they were good and *she* was bad.  But I just\u2026\n\nI looked back at the monitor for the first time since reading the words.  Rachel was already moving the paintings back off the sofa, as though she knew the message had been received.  A canvas in each hand, she glanced up at the camera as she moved across the room, and it felt like she was looking right at me.  My chest tightened as my hands moved away from the buttons.  \n\nNo.  I didn\u2019t think she was bad.  I had watched her for years.  I felt like I knew her, would know if she was bad.  Strange as it seemed, in a way she was my friend.  And I was going to try and help her.\n\n**** \n\nI spent the rest of my shift trying to act normal and think of what to do.  I knew whoever else was watching might have noticed the paintings or seen how I acted, but I couldn\u2019t worry about that.  I would try to play it cool and try to think how I could help her.\n\nThe only people I had actually met connected to this job were a couple of people when I filled out the papers and then Mr. Solomon when he showed me the model room and told me the job.  I had no way of contacting any of them except through the buttons.  My checks were deposited electronically and I had never run into anyone else who worked at the surveillance room.\n\nThat thought made me stop a second.  I had always thought it was weird that I never ran into someone when I was coming or going\u2014the person I was taking over for or the person who was taking over for me.  I had always figured there must be other people, other surveillance rooms even, and they just scheduled us so we didn\u2019t run into each other.  And I still thought there were others.\n\nPart of why I thought that was because it seemed like I wasn\u2019t the only person who used my surveillance room.  The water cooler, the toilet paper, the soap, they all seemed go down faster than I think I was using it by myself.  If that was true, maybe I could figure out who they were, and maybe they would be safer to talk to than whoever it was that I worked for.\n\nI got off work at eight that night, and instead of grabbing some food and going home, I drove my car around the block and then parked down the street from the building where I worked.  Nothing had changed while I drove around for a minute\u2014no new cars had parked or anything\u2014and if I was right, they didn\u2019t send anyone to replace me until they were sure I was gone anyhow.  \n\nSo I sat and waited.\n\nI was tired and the street was pretty empty and boring, but I was too excited and scared to fall sleep.  Every time a car passed or someone walked down the sidewalk, I tensed.  I kept imagining a SUV or van pulling up behind me.  Men getting out and pulling me from my car, taking me somewhere like where they had Rachel to kill or torture me.  Half a dozen times I almost cranked up and drove away, but every time I would think of her alone in that room.  She had no one but me to help her, and I had to try.\n\nTwo hours later, a fat balding man parked and started heading for the building.  As soon as I saw he was able to unlock the door and enter, I opened my car door to go talk to him.  Then I stopped.  I needed to be smart.  I didn\u2019t know where they were, but I was sure there were hidden cameras in the locker room and outside the building.  If I go running in there and confront that guy, they\u2019ll know for sure that I\u2019m up to something.\n\nSighing with frustration, I shut the door back and waited until his shift was over.  I considered tailing him like in the movies, but I was scared I would just lose him or he would call someone for help.  So I waited until he was walking back to his car after a six hour shift, hopefully far enough away that the cameras wouldn\u2019t see.  And then I met the man I came to know as Charles Jefferies.\n\n**** \n\n\u201cHey\u2026Hey, man, can I talk to you for a minute?\u201d   His back was to me and he just waved his hand absently without looking up.\n\n\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t have any money.  Have a good\u2026\u201d  He froze as he glanced back at me while talking.  \u201cOh God.  No.  No.  You need to get out of here, kid.  We aren\u2019t allowed to talk.\u201d  I could tell he was scared, but I couldn\u2019t risk letting him go yet, not after all this.  I stepped up and pushed the door back shut as he was trying to get into his car.\n\n\u201cSo you know who I am?\u201d  I tried to not sound mean, but I could hear how mad I was in my voice.\n\nHe yanked at the door again, but I was still holding it, and I was stronger than he was.  After a second, weaker tug, he turned around, his face strained and tired-looking.  \u201cYeah, I know who you are.  You work here just like me.  And I\u2019m telling you, we aren\u2019t supposed to be talking.  We aren\u2019t supposed to meet, ever.\u201d\n\nI frowned.  \u201cMr. Solomon never told me that.  He never said it was one of the rules.\u201d\n\nThe man shook his head.  \u201cMr. Solomon.  Yeah.  Well there are plenty of rules they don\u2019t tell you.  I bet they didn\u2019t tell you what you were going to be watching before you started, did they?\u201d  When I just lowered my eyes, he went on.  \u201cYeah, me either.  I\u2019ve been at this job for ten years.  I\u2019ve seen other people come and go, usually because they broke one those rules they never mentioned.  The only reason I\u2019m still here is because I keep my head down and my mouth shut.\u201d  He wagged a finger at me.  \u201cYou should do the same, if it\u2019s not already too late.\u201d\n\nI felt my stomach curling into a cold knot.  \u201cToo late?\u201d\n\nThe man rubbed his face.  \u201cKid, do you think they don\u2019t know we\u2019re talking?  Do you think anything happens that they don\u2019t know about?\u201d  He looked back toward the building, a look of sadness and fear in his eyes.  \u201cHell, for all I know, you\u2019ve already killed us both.\u201d  Shaking his head, he pushed me back and started opening the door.  \u201cEither way, I\u2019m done risking it.  You need to stop asking questions and just do your job.  It\u2019s a lot healthier.\u201d\n\nWith that, he got into his car and shut the door.  I didn\u2019t try to stop him this time.  Even though I had already been worried about what he was telling me, hearing it confirmed was paralyzing.  What exactly was my plan?  He probably didn\u2019t know any more than I did, and even if he did, what could I do with anything he told me?\n\nI walked back to my car with a heavy heart.  I was still afraid, but more than that, I was sad and ashamed.  I wanted to help Rachel, but I wasn\u2019t sure how.  I wasn\u2019t giving up, but as I drove back to my apartment, I couldn\u2019t think of what I should do next.  This wasn\u2019t a movie.  I wasn\u2019t a hero.  And the only ideas I had left were to either go to the police, who might be controlled by whoever I worked for, or try to get proof of her being held prisoner myself.\n\nAs I parked my car and walked into my apartment building, I made a decision.  Unless I thought of something better overnight, I would do both ideas.  Tomorrow I would break the rule about carrying anything in.  I\u2019d use my phone to record a video of the surveillance room, of Rachel and how she was trapped somewhere, and of me telling everything else I knew.  And I would email it to every newspaper, website, and internet channel I could think of.  I\u2019d then go to the police and give them a copy too if I could make it that long without getting caught.  Maybe if I did all that, even if they got me, someone would help Rachel.\n\nI was filled with worry and dread at the idea of being hurt or killed.  A part of me kept saying I should just do as I was told and hope that it all went away.  But I couldn\u2019t live with myself if I did that.  Even if I messed up, I felt like I had to try.  I was so preoccupied that I didn\u2019t hear the person coming up behind me as I unlocked my apartment door.\n\n\u201cThomas?\u201d\n\nI turned around and felt my legs weaken as I stumbled back against my door.  I had to be dreaming or crazy.  I grabbed the door knob for support as I looked at the woman in front of me.  It couldn\u2019t be her, but somehow it was.\n\n[\u201cRachel?\u201d](https:\/\/redd.it\/9ndww5)\n\n****\n\n[Part Three](https:\/\/redd.it\/bsg2az)"},"251":{"title":"They paid me $5000 to go through hell","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/fjma9t\/they_paid_me_5000_to_go_through_hell\/","flair":null,"author":"Jaksim","selftext":"It was the advertisement\u2019s outright simplicity that caught my attention.\n\n\u201cRevolutionize science! Earn $5000! Call us now!\u201d\n\nI wish I could say I didn\u2019t know why I called them. I wish I could say it was some act of God or deception that drove me into their waiting arms. But that would be a lie. The truth is I called them because I needed the money. Because I had gotten laid off at the publishing company I worked at and I was having trouble finding steady work. Because I was months behind on rent and facing my second eviction notice. Because I didn\u2019t want to be a failure.\n\nI called them for selfish reasons.\n\nWho are they? I\u2019m not exactly sure. In retrospect, their obvious obfuscation of their identity should have been a red flag to me. But at the time, their request seemed too interesting, their reward too vital, for me to risk losing the chance to help them. My best guess is that they\u2019re a group of private researchers that are funded by some super-corporation. They must be. Otherwise, there was no way they would have been able to pay for the machine.\nThey showed me the machine the first time I met with them. It was kept in a cavernous room in the basement of a five-story office building. It was a work in progress at that time \u2013 they were still connecting pipes and soldering wires. But even in an unfinished state, it looked truly magnificent.\n\n\u201cHave you ever heard of a sensory deprivation chamber?\u201d\n\nI had. In fact, I had actually been inside one before, when I was in college. Back then, I was on a real hippy-dippy spiritual journey. You know, meditating a lot, experimenting with psychedelic drugs. Primarily magic mushrooms. At some point along that journey, I felt motivated to spend an hour of my life (and sixty dollars of my student loans) inside a sensory deprivation chamber at a local spa.\nYour standard sensory deprivation chamber is a large metal tank filled with about a foot of salt water. You step in and float in the water, then someone (a spa attendant, in my case) closes off the tank so it\u2019s completely dark. With your vision obscured and your body suspended in the water, it\u2019s supposed to feel like you no longer have your two primary senses. Depending on who you ask, this is supposed to be relaxing, enhance your creative process, allow you to reach higher consciousness, hallucinate, or maybe gain magic powers.\n\nMy experience with the chamber in college was fairly lackluster. I remember that the water was too frigid and the salt made my skin itch. It was difficult to concentrate on meditating or channeling my inner chakra or whatever the spa had promised. Truthfully, I did always wonder what it would have been like to get in one of those things while tripping on some magic mushrooms, but I never had the opportunity.\nThis sensory deprivation chamber didn\u2019t look anything like the one I used in college. This chamber looked like a vivisected suit of medieval armor strewn across a large metal table. Thousands of tubes and wires connected to the metal body, which was about three times larger than my own body. The head or \u201chelmet\u201d of the chamber was collosal and round with a big brass pipe running out of its crown into the tiled-floor beneath it. On the walls surrounding the chamber were fifty or sixty computer screens, twenty or so server boxes, and various iterations of medical equipment that I couldn\u2019t name if I tried. \n\nIt dawns on me now that the utility bills and computers alone for the machine must have been many tens of times higher than the measly $5000 they offered me, not to mention the salaries of the dozens of labcoat-clad scientists manning those computer screens. Again, perhaps this should have raised alarm bells, but I ignored it with the focused ignorance of a man who was on the brink of homelessness.\nThe man who showed me the machine told me his name was Dr. Monason. He was a wrinkled, balding man with a clean shave and focused eyes of blue. When I saw him, he was always clad in blue scrubs and a clean white labcoat. \n\nDr. Monason was the primary liaison for my involvement on this project. He explained the machine\u2019s purpose, brought me the necessary waivers, and answered all my questions.\n\nQuestions like, \u201cSo what exactly am I supposed to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want you to remain in our sensory deprivation chamber for three days.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sure my expression betrayed my sense of shock. \n\n\u201cThree days? Is that \u2013 I mean will \u2013 Will that kill me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou probably would still be alive after three days in pure isolation, though you would likely become gravely ill and suffering from immense dehydration. Regardless, the machine will hydrate, feed, and otherwise sustain you during the experiment. So there is no risk of bodily harm.\u201d\n\nDr. Monason went on to explain how the machine worked.\n\n\u201cIn your standard deprivation chamber, the occupant is deprived of their sense of sight, feeling, and, to a lesser extent, hearing. This deprivation, this process of shutting the outside world out from the occupant\u2019s mind, decreases the burden on their brain. Thus, the occupant\u2019s mind is free to wander more freely \u2013 free to think more creatively, to undergo a deeper state of thinking, to meditate, and so on.\n\n\u201cBut there is a problem with standard sensory deprivation chambers. Although the brain is freed from most external stimuli, the visual and auditory, the brain will continue to be burdened by internal stimuli. That is to say that the brain is still very aware of its own carrier \u2013 the human body. The brain will still react to the hunger and thirst of the vessel that carries it. It will still process both the need to and the action of urination and defecation. These internal interruptions go on and on, but the point is that standard sensory deprivation chambers cannot truly be said to deprive the occupant of their senses.\n\n\u201cThis machine is not your standard sensory deprivation chamber.\u201d\n\nEven a cursory glance at the machine made clear what the doctor meant. \n\n\u201cThe inside of the exoskeleton portion of the machine is lined with a soft rubber that will acclimate to maintain the exact temperature of human skin. The tubes and wires control and regulate a wide variety of bodily functions. Through these tubes, the body is automatically fed and hydrated. The unsavory functions of the body are handled with a catheter and another series of tubes. A respirator automates breathing and regulates saliva production.\n\n\u201cEven the body\u2019s natural sense of touch is completely removed while in the machine. This IV cord injects a numbing solution into the bloodstream that completely shuts off all feeling. The numbing agent is the most critical asset of our sensory deprivation process.\u201d\n\nThe list went on and on. It became clear that they had truly accounted for everything.\n\nEven for me. I was one of hundreds of applicants to be part of the experiment. For the first time in my life, I was the first round draft pick. The scientists explained to me that I had been chosen for three reasons.\n\nNumber one: I had no prior history of mental or physical illness that would make my experience in the chamber subject to \u201cintervening variables.\u201d Their words, not mine.\n\nNumber two: My height and weight were close matches for the machine\u2019s original shape. \n\n\u201cAlthough the legs will have to be lengthened ever so slightly, you are by far the closest match to our initial design.\u201d\n\nAnd number three, the most critical: There was nothing happening outside of that chamber that would lead to an early termination of the experiment. I had no significant other, no job, no living family members \u2013 not even a houseplant to take care of. They could breathe easy knowing that I would remain peacefully within their contraption for the entire length of the experiment.\n\nNumber three was important to the scientists. They had specifically designed the machine to allow for three full days of isolation. If the machine\u2019s process had to be interrupted early, it would take them a month to reset the machine and run the experiment again. \n\nUnfortunately, reason number three also meant there was nobody to come looking for me.\n\nThe intake process was long and detailed. I signed what felt like hundreds of liability waivers. I listened to warning after warning about the potential side effects.\n\n\u201cAlthough it is apparent that you have a clean bill of health, you should be aware the isolation process may be taxing on you. Our preliminary research suggests that disassociation, audio and visual hallucinations, depression, time dilation, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, and other neuroses are potential effects. However, we believe such effects to be unlikely.\u201d\n\nThey had given me several weeks to prepare for the experiment. My only requirement during that time was that I didn\u2019t substantially change my bodyweight or somehow develop bipolar disorder. Somehow, I managed. I spent those few weeks living normally \u2013 watching movies, applying for jobs, getting rejected for those jobs, and reading a few books.\n\nWhen the day came, I was nervous despite Dr. Monason\u2019s efforts to prepare me.\n\n\u201cThe process will come in stages. At first, you may endure a mild state of stress. We anticipate that soon after, you will drift into a moderate state of euphoria for the remainder of the process. You will be signaled a few minutes before the experiment is over by a short audio queue. This way, you will emerge from your state of sensory deprivation slowly and be able to re-acclimate without any risk of shock.\u201d\n\nHe played the audio queue for me, which was a short musical clip of bells ringing. \nThen, with little ceremony or deliberation, I was asked to asked to remove my clothing and climb inside the machine.\n\nAs I lay down inside the exoskeleton, I felt the warm rubber against my bare skin. Even with the chamber still open, I was confined on all sides by the metal shell of the machine. Slowly, the researchers began to attach a score of medical devices to my body. I felt strangely calm through every prick of an IV and uncomfortable insertion of a tube.\nBut, as a respirator was placed on my face, I began to feel a foreboding sense of unease. As I felt my body being constricted and held in place a single thought filled my mind.\n\nOh God what have I done.\n\nThe researchers pushed the helmet of the exoskeleton inward on either side of my head, sealing off my ears. The world went quiet. A bead of sweat began to trickle down my sides. Then I heard a voice, seemingly broadcast from inside my own head.\n\u201cHello. This is Dr. Monason. I am speaking to you via a small speaker contained within the helmet of the exoskeleton. Your vital signs indicate that you are beginning to panic. This is to be expected. Please do your best to relax while we finish preparing you. I promise that the process will become pleasurable soon enough.\u201d\n\nSomehow telling me to relax just made me more anxious. Before I could react, I felt the machine close around my body. Already the numbing agent that was being piped into my bloodstream was starting to take away control of my extremities. I tried to push against the machine but found that my arms wouldn\u2019t budge. I tried to scream but the respirator held my tongue firmly in place. I was unable to move, unable to do anything.\n\nExcept watch.\n\nI could still watch as researchers scrambled around me to check vitals and prepare the exoskeleton to finish closing. I could still watch as a giant analog timer appeared on a tv screen above me and began to broadcast a time.\n\n00:00:01:00 Until Deprivation Begins.\n\nI tried again to scream. I tried again to plead to be let out. I found myself unable to feel any part of my body. I strained my eyes to try and get someone\u2019s attention but no one seemed to be looking at me.\n\n00:00:00:30 Until Deprivation Begins.\n\nHad my tear ducts been operating, I would have begun crying.  Without nothing else to do, I began to pray that this was a bad dream. To pray that I was home in bed and not in this chamber.\n\n00:00:00:05 Until Deprivation Begins.\n\nThe last thing I saw was the face of Dr. Monason leaning over me. Waving to me. Saying something I couldn\u2019t quite understand. Closing the exoskeleton\u2019s face over my own.\n\n00:00:00:00 Until Deprivation Begins.\n\nAnd then everything went dark.\n\n\nIf I had been in control of my own breathing, I would have begun hyperventilating immediately. \n\nI had never felt such a profound sense of darkness as in that moment. Unable to see even my own body, it was as if I had been extinguished from existence. My eyes swam in every direction in search of a single iota of light but found none.\n\nAfter a moment\u2019s consideration, I realized that I had now been in the machine for some time. I had no reference point for exactly how long. Without outside stimuli of any kind, my only mechanism of telling time was by counting individual seconds in my head.\n\nYet time ticked on. I found myself alternating between obsessing about my imprisonment and finding myself adrift in my thoughts. \n\nI began to consider the state of my life. My recent unemployment. My lack of close friends. I felt a wave of depression come over me. Was my life really so meaningless that I could be snuffed out of existence for three days and no one could possibly care?\n\nI pondered the source of my isolation. I looked back to times I could have tried harder at my job. Images of friendships that I had let fall apart out of introversion and stagnation cascaded through my mind. \nAnd then I came across a thought in my head that, were my body not numbed to the point of immobility, would have made me burst out into laughter.\n\nI felt lonely.\n\nWell, of course, I felt lonely. I was, at that moment, the most alone human being there had ever been. Surely there were researchers only a few feet from my terrestrial body, but my mind had been isolated completely. I was as alone as someone could be.\n\nI let my mind continue to wander. It felt as though I had been in the chamber for hours at this point. Although I had planned to spend this time planning some sort of creative endeavor \u2013 the great American novel, perhaps \u2013 I found my mind repeatedly coming back to my current predicament. \n\nObsessively, I thought about my body and the container that currently housed it. The numbing medicine must have been truly quite something. I couldn\u2019t feel the slightest wisp of breath passing through my nasal cavities or the rumble of my stomach.\n\nIt was then that a pair of intertwining thoughts collided in my mind.\n\nA: Could I be dead?\n\nB: No, of course not. That would be ridiculous. \n\nI knew how I had ended up here \u2013 I knew that I had signed up to engage in an experiment that would put me in this exact predicament. But I must admit, I no longer felt very alive. Without my body or the surrounding world as a reference point, it felt as though I had no assurance that I still existed. My thoughts began dueling with one another.\n\nA: Surely I\u2019m not dead. This is exactly what the experiment was supposed to do.\n\nB: If you\u2019re not dead then why can\u2019t you feel anything? Why can\u2019t you feel your breath or saliva or ANYTHING?\n\nA: But I know I\u2019m not dead because I\u2019m thinking right now.\n\nB: What does that mean?\n\nA: You know? I think, therefore I am.\n\nI think, therefore I am. A smarter man could have told you who said that. But I was left with just that proclamation, from an unknown source, as the only assurance that I was alive. As long as I was thinking, I was still alive.\n\nI began to picture myself floating through a void in space. The image was clear in front of my eyes. My body lay flat, my arms stiff, as I rocketed past stars and unfamiliar planets. I watched my body weave past asteroids and through planetary rings. I felt the warmth of the sun on my body and the cold ice of the frozen planets on my skin.\n\nExcept I didn\u2019t really feel those things. I had to remind myself of that. I was starting to imagine feelings that weren\u2019t really there. I wasn\u2019t sure how much I should try to avoid these feelings or just embrace them for the duration of the experiment. Just another question to ponder, I suppose.\n\nThere came a time when I realized that I had been in sensory deprivation for a long time. Since I had not been counting, it was impossible to know how long. It felt like it had been days already.\n\nHad it been days already?\n\nThat was a worrying thought. In a timeless void, three days stretched on like an endless millennium. \n\nThey had assured me that I would only be inside the machine for three days. But how could I know for sure? Once I was inside, I had no way of getting out. They could keep me for as long as they wanted to. Maybe that was their plan all along. \n\nA: How could they get away with that? \n\nB: Who knows what all those liability waivers I signed said. I stopped reading them after the third or fourth one. Maybe I agreed to this. \n\nA: You\u2019re being crazy.\n\nB: I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being crazy or not. I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve been in here.\n\nA: So count!\n\nThat was right. I had one way to tell how long I had been inside the machine. Counting.\n\nOne.\n\nTwo.\n\nThree.\n\nFour.\n\nFive.\n\nAnd on and on. I counted to 60. That was a minute. And then I counted another minute. And another and another and another. I just kept going and going. I never lost focus on the task at hand.\nThen I hit 1000 minutes. Technically, 1000 minutes was only a little more than 16 and a half hours. Certainly not the three-day period I was supposed to be inside the machine. \n\nBut that was 16 and a half hours on top of all the time I had already spent thinking about my life and dreaming about floating through space. Surely I had spent longer thinking to myself than I had counting.\n\nI tried to guess how long I had been in the machine. It felt like it had been more than three days. I just kept trying to tell myself that I would be let out of the machine soon.\n\nI let my mind drift off again. \n\nMy body was once again floating through space. I watched it drift farther and farther out into an endless void of darkness. The planets and suns shrunk into oblivion until I was truly, deeply alone. \nIn the black abyss, a creeping feeling of cold began to set in. Its biting sting spread up my legs and torso to my face. My naked skin turned a pale blue and begun to harden into a crystalline husk. As my body drifted farther into darkness, I watched the surface of my stomach crack and chip. \n\nSlowly, chunks of my body began to break off and float into the darkness. With each expelled scrap of flesh, a new wave of pain cascaded through my body. I found myself trying to grab onto my frozen body and put it back together, but my arms and legs were so cold that I could not budge. I tried to scream but my tongue had swelled so large that it filled my crumbling, frigid mouth.\nAll at once, my body exploded into an array of jagged, bloody shards of ice. The pain was indescribable.\n\nThen I was, again, alone in the darkness. Bodiless. Without lungs to expel the panicked breaths I was so desperate to create. I had to keep telling myself \u2013 it wasn\u2019t real. I\u2019m still alive. My body is still here, somewhere.\n\nA: But god, didn\u2019t it feel real?\n\nB: But it wasn\u2019t real.\n\nA: Real or not, didn\u2019t it hurt?\n\nB: Yes.\n\nA: Are you scared?\n\nB: Yes.\n\n. . .\n\nA: Wait. Do you hear that?\n\nI listened through ears that were a million miles away. A voice \u2013 not mine own \u2013 burst into my head. Its bristly accent was familiar.\n\n\u201cHello! This is Dr. Monason. I\u2019m contacting you again via the small speakers contained within the helmet of the exoskeleton. I am proud to announce that you have successfully completed three days within the machine.\u201d\n\nI felt my alarm melt quickly into relief. I tried to smile, to little avail.\n\n\u201cAt this juncture, we would like to update you as to the status of our experiment. The data we\u2019re getting from your brain scans is proving incredibly useful. The medical implications are numerous. We have contacted our institutional review board and obtained permission to extend the experiment indefinitely. This is, of course, in accordance with the liability waivers that you\u2019ve signed previously. The machine should be able to keep you alive for a few more weeks until your body becomes unable to support it any further. Do not worry, $5000 will nonetheless be credited into your account. Thank you for your contribution. Your sacrifice will save lives.\u201d\n\nI tried to scream. I tried to flail my arms in protest and push back against the doctor\u2019s words but my screams were silent and my arms no longer part of me.\n\nI felt a deep, echoing hole of dread grow inside me. Yet I would never truly feel anything again.\n\nI would die in this chamber. It would take days. And those days would feel like months. And those months would be torture. \n\nI again saw myself floating in an immeasurable darkness. There were no stars or planets. There was only my body. Unequivocally alone. Arguably alive, but inevitably dead.\n\nI stopped counting the seconds and just let myself float.\n\n--\n\nMy mind wandered again, this time for much longer. I dreamt of my childhood and of a future I would never get to lead. I made an imaginary bucket list and felt remorse for the boxes I had not yet checked. I held conversations in my head between old friends and lovers. \n\nAnd sometimes, I didn\u2019t think at all. Sometimes I disappeared from existence altogether.\n\nBut then I felt it. I felt something. I couldn\u2019t tell what it was at first. It had been so long since I felt something that I couldn\u2019t tell if I was imagining it or not.\n\nIt was my big toe. My big toe on my right foot. Somehow, someway, it still had feeling. Not a lot of feeling \u2013 it felt like when you sit on your hand and it becomes almost, but not quite, numb. Like it was being massaged by a set of pins and needles.\n\nI moved the toe around, the little that I could, to try to understand how this feeling had come back.\n\nThen I felt it \u2013 a tiny prick. The slightest droplet of pain against my big toe. Something sharp.\n\nAn IV needle.\n\nIt must have become dislodged somehow. Maybe one of those labcoat-wearing schmucks tripped over it or something. All I knew was that I could feel again. I suddenly felt like I had been born again. Like I had died and risen from the ashes.\n\nThis needle must have been one of the needles that was supposed to deliver the numbing chemical into my body. Somehow, it got dislodged and now I had just a little feeling in my toe. Unfortunately, my big toe was hardly the vestige of my body most suited to orchestrate my grand escape. \n\nBut still, I felt immeasurable happiness. Because I had a secret weapon on my side. \n\nTime. There\u2019s an old adage that goes \u201cIf you give a monkey a typewriter and infinite time, he will eventually write the complete works of Shakespeare\u201d. Similarly, with a partially numb big toe and infinite time to think, I could craft my grand escape.\n\nMy big toe was too weak to push open the exoskeleton. Despite my straining, I was unable to reach any other cords to pull them out. All I could reach was the IV needle that had already been pulled out.\nAnd with that IV needle, I hatched my plan. I scraped my toe across it. It stung, but I knew it would do the trick. I knew that I had forced those stupid scientists\u2019 hands. My efforts had made a cut in my toe-skin. And now I knew I was going to be okay.\n\nThey only had two options. Let me bleed out, in which case I would at least be free from this hell, or let me out of the chamber, at least long enough to reattach the IV. Either way, my plan was foolproof. Either way, I was going to be free, at least for a moment.\n\nIt only took them a few minutes to notice what I had done.\n\n--\n\n\u201cThis is Dr. Monason again, communicating via the tiny speaker in the helmet of the exoskeleton. It seems you have managed to injure yourself inside the exoskeleton. After some discussion, we have elected to pause the experiment and correct the error. Stand by \u2013 the exoskeleton will be opening shortly.\u201d\n\nThe light that soon flooded my eyes all but blinded me. As the machine opened, I bathed in the sounds of its electronic thunks and whirs and the conversation of the men around me. The quick tug as needles and tube were removed from me felt better than any touch I had ever experienced.\n\nThey let me out. I was free.\n\nMy body was numb for hours. The medicine prevented me from making any movements, at all. During that time, the scientists left me in the exoskeleton as they went over data and bandaged my big toe. I tried to listen to everything they were saying but found myself unable to concentrate. The bright lights above me burned my eyes, which had grown accustomed to perfect darkness.\n\nAs the drugs slowly left my body, a dull ache developed in my joints. After a while, my body was hauled out of the exoskeleton by a team of the labcoats. I felt a dressing gown slip on over my head. I was plopped into a wheelchair. Still unable to move, I listened to the roll of metal wheels as they pushed that chair deeper and deeper into their lab.\n\n--\n\n\u201cExplain again about when you were floating through space. What was the sensation like?\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease let me go!\u201d\n\n \u201cI can\u2019t. You know that. The data we were getting from you is too important. Lives are at stake. And besides that, we can\u2019t risk you going to the police. You will be going back in the machine.\u201d\n\nThis conversation had been going on for about an hour in the tiny interrogation room set up somewhere in the research group\u2019s massive underground lab. Although I had regained enough feeling to speak, I still found movement quite difficult. It was clear that as soon as I outlived my usefulness to the lab coats I was going to be placed back inside the machine until my bodily demise. The data that the scientists had gained so far was so useful that they had no problem holding me against my will.\n\nAs I sat in that tiny metal room, tied to cold folding chair, clad only in a thin dressing gown, I considered my fate. For $5000 I had sold away the rest of my life. My only respite now was that I could delay going back in the machine for as long as I resisted Dr. Monason\u2019s questioning. But I knew I was just delaying the inevitable.\n\nI stared down at my big toe, now wrapped in a bandage. Somehow it had not dawned on me that, even if I got out of the machine, the scientists were unlikely to let me out of the building alive. Not after they decided to imprison me until I died, anyway.\n\n\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t answer the questions?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe data we intend to receive from those questions is critical and could save lives. But if we cannot illicit it, then the information received from the exoskeleton will be sufficient. If you won\u2019t answer, we will return you to the machine now.\u201d\n\nSo it didn\u2019t matter. I was already doomed. I might as well delay for as long as I could.\n\n\u201cFine. Ask me what you want to ask me.\u201d\n\nI answered hundreds of questions, most of them multiple times. It took hours. The scientists barely listened to my words. There was a recorder placed in the room with me. I\u2019m sure someone would dig through my answers later, but for now the conversation seemed to be mostly for posterity\u2019s sake.\n\nAt some point though, I realized something. The drugs had completely left my body. I could, theoretically, move again. For now, I was tied to a chair. But they couldn\u2019t keep me tied up if they wanted me to go back into the machine.\n\nAnd from that thought, I came up with a plan. I knew I would only have a few seconds. I knew I couldn\u2019t run immediately, or they would catch me. I would have to convince them I was resigned to my fate.\nWhen the questioning concluded, I found myself being hauled back into the chamber containing the exoskeleton. Perhaps assuming that I would flee otherwise, the scientists kept me tied up during transit.\n\nBut the ties came off when it was time to put me in the machine. They stripped off my night gown and lifted me inside the machine. I let my body go limp as they did \u2013 feigning the same numbness that had, until recently, restricted my movement. As I laid down in the rubber interior of the exoskeleton, Dr. Monason spoke to me through a loudspeaker in the ceiling. \n\n\u201cI am sorry we have to part again. Your answers will be invaluable for future research. I know it may seem now like we are villains. But the research we\u2019re obtaining is invaluable. It will save lives someday. You are doing a valuable service to the world.\u201d\n\nAs his speech ended, his researchers again approached to fill my body with needles and tubes. I was eager to make my escape but I held tight. They would have to believe I was unable to move.\n\nI felt pinpricks in my right arm. I was already being loaded up with the numbing agent. My time was going to be short. As some of the labcoats approached me on my left side to insert another IV, I launched myself upward so I was standing inside the machine. Surprised by my sudden motion, the scientists on my left recoiled. I felt a sharp pain in my right arm as the IVs and tubes held tight against the strain of my sudden motion.\n\nThe room exploded into panic. Men rushed at me from all sides. I felt my body moving as if on its own volition. My left arm reached towards my right and ripped a series of cords and needles out of my body. Blood sprayed onto the machine. My right arm fell loosely to my side.\n\nI propelled myself out of the machine and onto the floor, naked as the day I was born. The numbing agent had disabled my right arm, but most of my body was fine. I sprinted towards the door through which I had entered the lab, what now seemed like a millennium ago. I did not dare turn back to see if I was being chased. All I could do was run.\n\nAs I pushed the door open, I saw a long hallway that led to a set of alternating staircases. Staircases that I had walked up and down several times while preparing for the experiment. Stairs that I had always assumed I would one day walk up for the last time. \n\nI pushed my body as hard as I could. I ran with my right arm dangling limp beside me until I reached the stairs. Behind me, the angered yells of men and the thud of their footsteps remained consistent. I knew that if they caught me, it was game over. \n\nWhen I reached the stairs, I practically jumped up the entire first flight. As I turned to climb the next flight, I saw that only two men had kept pace with me. Suddenly, I was filled with hope. Perhaps I could outrun them all. Then I would go to the police and get the chance to put this whole operation under the microscope. As soon as I got to the top of that second flight of stairs and through the exit doors, I would be free.\n\nMy hopes were dashed as soon as I reached the top of the stairs. At least fifteen men guarded the building\u2019s exit. Clearly my escape had been a contingency for which the facility was prepared. As the men approached behind me and in front of me, I knew there was only one way I could go.\n\nThe alternating staircases continued past the first floor. All the way up to the roof.\n\nI kept running. Staircase after staircase. My aching body protesting each step. My dead arm banging against stair railings and walls as I made my way up those stairs. The sounds of angry men filling my ears as I took step after step after step.\n\nSoon I was on the last staircase. A ladder, hanging from the ceiling, led up to a hatch on the roof of the building. This was it. I was going to see the outside world again. I didn\u2019t know where I was going to go once I got up there, but I knew I was free.\n\nI jumped onto the ladder and pulled myself up, about six feet into the air. When I reached the top I pushed on the hatch. It was heavy and barely budged. I strained against the hatch for a moment, then felt a tight grip on my ankle.\n\nOne of the men had caught up. He had wrapped his cold hand around my leg and was beginning to yank me off the ladder. I turned slightly and saw it was Dr. Monason. His eyes were red and as large as saucers. It was like looking into the eyes of the devil himself. \n\nI reacted purely out of instinct. My grip on the ladder tightened and I swung my free foot at the doctor\u2019s face. As my heel collided with his jaw, sending teeth and blood flying in all directions, I couldn\u2019t help but smile at the feeling. It hurt like you wouldn\u2019t believe, but it felt damned good to feel something. \n\nDr. Monason relaxed his grip. I pushed upwards again and the hatch gave way. I clambered upwards onto the flat roof of the building. A thin layer of gravel covered the rooftop. The sharp stones poked at my bare feet, but I kept moving. I ran to the edge of the roof and looked out into the city. \n\nA beautiful horizon of skyscrapers and stars filled my view. I felt the cold breeze against my bare skin. The voices of the men behind me barely registered as I climbed onto the edge of the roof.\nI must have been a sight to the people walking by on the sidewalk below. A naked man standing on the edge of a building staring at the horizon as if he had never seen one before. \n\n\u201cPlease come down from there. You don\u2019t have to go back in the machine. We just need you to come down.\u201d \n\nIt was Dr. Monason again. His voice was hard to understand now that he was short a few teeth. I turned away from the horizon to look at him. He was surrounded on all sides by other men in labcoats.\n\nI knew at that moment that I had no real choices left. Could I believe Dr. Monason that he wouldn\u2019t put me back in the machine? Probably not. But I had no chance to escape at this point. There were too many of them for me to get away.\n\nJust as one of the researchers reached out to grab me, I took a step backward.\n\nAs my body tumbled down to the earth below, I found myself laughing. It was just like when I was in the machine. My body was floating once again. The cold air numbed my body and, once again, I couldn\u2019t feel a thing. \n\nJust before I struck the ground, I heard the sound of church bells ringing out. Hallelujah. I figured I must be on my way to heaven.\n\n--\n\nNo heaven came. Instead, I found myself in complete darkness. Feeling nothing, seeing nothing, simply ruminating on my previous actions. \n\nIs this what death is like?\n\nIn answer to my question, I heard a familiar voice.\n\n\u201cHello. This is Dr. Monason. I am speaking to you once again via a small speaker contained within the helmet of the exoskeleton. You have successfully completed your three days within the exoskeleton.\u201d\n\nHad I not still been pumped full of numbing drugs, I would have wept. \n\n\u201cWe are currently in the process of opening the machine. At that point, we will perform a physical assessment. I\u2019m sure you are anxious to leave. I can assure you we will move as quickly as possible to make that happen. Thank you so much for your assistance with this project. It has been invaluable.\u201d\n\nThree days. I had been in that machine for exactly three days. \n\nIt didn\u2019t click for me until they were pulling me out of the machine. There was no bandage on my big toe, no needle near my foot on which I could have cut myself. \n\nThe facility was nothing but accommodating in the hours after the experiment terminated. They provided me with a comfortable place to rest while the remainder of the drugs left my system. Although they asked questions about my experience, they were not hostile when I refused to speak. The researchers were happy to answer my questions about the experience. Happy to tell me it was all in my head.\n\nIn the days following the experiment, Dr. Monason made sure that I was provided with any mental health resources that I requested. He connected me with a therapist that I have been seeing for several weeks. The therapist has prescribed me an antidepressant, which I take twice a day. I have returned to my normal life. My rent is paid. I\u2019m seeing someone new. I got a new job at another book publishing company. \n\nIt\u2019s like all my fantasies have come true.\n\nBut no matter how long I talk to the therapist and no matter how many pills I take, I can\u2019t get the machine out of my head. I can\u2019t stop thinking about how those three days seemed to extend indefinitely.\n\nA: But you\u2019re out of the machine. Your three days are up!\n\nB: Yes, but\u2026\n\nA: But what?\n\nB: I was out of the machine once before. \n\nA: But that wasn\u2019t real.\n\nB: But it felt real. \n\nA: Does this feel real?\n\nB: . . . I don\u2019t know anymore.\n\nCould three days feel . . . even longer? Could I imagine a therapist, a job, a better life?  I don\u2019t know.\n\nSometimes I close my eyes and I become too afraid to open them, because I\u2019m worried that when I do, I will see only darkness. I\u2019m scared I will find myself still floating, motionless, amongst those imaginary stars. \n\n\n [J.L.](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Jlaughlinhorror)"},"252":{"title":"The previous tenant of my new flat left a survival guide.

Looking at it. At her.\n\nPrudence had a facial expression filled with guilt and now I knew the truth I could see it. The creature was exactly how Ian had described, except with wavy ginger hair and a sadness in its beady eyes. \n\nThis abomination was Lyla. This was how Prudence had bought her back, and this was the only way I would ever see Jamie again, a risk I wasn\u2019t going to take. After days of disbelief the reality finally hit me like a ton of bricks. Jamie was dead and he wasn\u2019t coming back.\n\n\u201cWhy did you do this?\u201d I asked, my voice shaking with horror.\n\nPrudence scowled at me, trying to mask her shame.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want this. If you think this was my aim then you\u2019re sicker than I am. I just wanted my granddaughter back. \n\nWhen she died a part of me died. My son blamed me, his wife blamed me and although he never said it, I could see in Bernie\u2019s eyes that he did too. \n\nI\u2019d pushed for her to stay, I wanted to spend more time with her. I got cocky about my ability to cope with the strange occurrences in the flats. I know what you must be thinking. But I swear I didn\u2019t know about the sleepwalking until it was too late.\n\nWe had moved into the flat not long after my son left home to move in with his girlfriend. He\u2019s the youngest of three and was the last to fly the nest, so we downsized for the two of us. He never knew what we were facing in that flat, or the dangers that he sent his little girl into. \n\nWhen it happened it was a few years after the fire and the troubles with the creatures. We\u2019d struck the deal with the things in the lift and the neighbours of the burned flats had become a fixture just like the other quirks. I really thought she would be safe.\u201d\n\nPrudence paused to gaze longingly at the mutated little girl in the cage, the creature just twitched. In return it barred its 4 rows of teeth and made a gentle hiss.\n\n\u201cBut how did you do this!?\u201d I stopped her with more urgency this time, looking at rat-Lyla in disbelief. I had to get answers out of her fast. I didn\u2019t want to spend anymore time than was absolutely necessary in this shed. \n\n\u201cThe gardener helped me.\u201d She answered, her voice trembling. \n\n\u201cWho the fuck is the gardener?\u201d I grew more impatient with every new confusion she threw at me. The last thing I needed was something new and potentially malevolent in the mix. \n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mention him in my note because he\u2019s been gone for over 20 years, he\u2019ll be of no concern to you so don\u2019t worry. His damage is in the past now...\n\nAround the time Lyla went missing the council granted planning permission for the tower block next door. But before that was built the land it sits on acted as a communal garden for ours and the neighbouring tower block on the other side. It had a regular gardener named Derek who you would often see tending the flowerbeds out front. \n\nDerek was one of the first people I met when I moved in.\n\nLike I said, I had to work it all out myself and the first time the window cleaner came to the balcony I naturally reached to let him in and offer a cup of tea.\n\nAs my hand applied pressure to the handle to open the balcony door, there was a knock at the front door. I made a gesture to the cleaner to indicate that I would only be a minute and answered. \n\nThere was Derek. He stopped me and told me not to let the man in, that I would be making a huge mistake.\n\nI thought he sounded crazy, and I told him so, after a while of arguing I got up to reboil the kettle and let the man in and Derek grabbed my hands and shouted at me to look at the man outside.\n\nWhen I turned to look, there was no man outside, but a monster. He was tall and impossibly thin, flesh and bones but somehow thinner than bones with greying skin stretched over them. He had eyes that seemed to be so deep set they went on forever, like the blackest cave you can imagine. Saliva dripped from his mouth and landed on my balcony floor, some sliding down the glass panel of the door. \n\nI opened my mouth to scream, but as I did, Derek let go of my hands and the monster was gone. In its place was that smug, friendly man, begging for a drink while he cleans the windows. \n\nIt took me a minute to process it, but I know what I\u2019d seen. That was the real window cleaner. I never intentionally opened or tried to open the door for him again. \n\nThat day Derek didn\u2019t stay long. He didn\u2019t tell me what the window cleaner is, or why he visits every few days. He didn\u2019t explain anything about the weird things that go on. As much as Derek was a part of the strange happenings he was like one that had been carved from light.\n\nHe said that he\u2019d always be around when I needed him, that it was his job to look after the residents just like the flowerbeds. \n\nOver the years he appeared a few times. He was instrumental in striking a deal with the creatures. When the neighbours died in the fire he created a special display for them in the garden, and made sure that nothing planted was poisonous to the cats as soon as they arrived. He also stopped an imposter from killing Bernie at our front door.\n\nHe seemed like such a good thing for the residents. Always there to help. Offer some gentle advice or a creative solution. Someone to be trusted.\n\nHe changed when they granted planning permission for the other block though. He knew his garden would be dug up to lay foundations and his uses redundant. He became grumpy and bitter over time but no one payed enough attention to notice. Especially not when my tragedy struck.\n\nWhen Lyla died I was devastated. Derek appeared to me as I sat on a bench in the garden crying. He offered to help me, to use the garden to get her back. I snapped at him. I told him it was his fault and that he should have been there when it happened to stop them. \n\nHe worked so hard on the agreement with the creatures, he spent a lot of time with them. Lyla broke the rule and he had to allow them to do what had been agreed, he said. He couldn\u2019t have stopped them. But he wanted to help make things right. \n\nI understood why he hadn\u2019t intervened. But I couldn\u2019t accept it, I lashed out at him. I\u2019m embarrassed to say I actually slapped the poor man along with stamping on his freshly planted flowerbed. I was angry and grieving. \n\nI quickly burned myself out and collapsed into a blubbering heap on the floor. Derek attempted to comfort me but his mind was on his garden.\n\nHe said he was sorry for my loss but I shouldn\u2019t have attacked the flowerbed. That he\u2019d always been nice to me and I should be kinder in return.\n\nI snapped and told him that it didn\u2019t matter because it was all about to be bulldozed in the next few days anyway.\n\nI should have taken more note of the way he twitched as I said that. He snapped.\n\nHe said that he knew I was angry. But there was no need to take it out on him, if I was that desperate to get Lyla back he knew a way. But it was dangerous. \n\nI begged. Anything I said. I would do anything. \n\nHe told me it was simple and that all I had to do was enter the lift and offer the creatures some food whilst repeating the phrase *revertetur mortuis* during their frenzied hours. \n\nHe said that there was no guarantee they wouldn\u2019t be crunching on my bones before I even got the first word out but that if I succeeded I would have Lyla back. \n\nOf course, it was successful. There wasn\u2019t a creature in sight as I performed the ritual as instructed. \n\nI thought nothing happened at first. She didn\u2019t appear straight away, but a few days later I found her running round inside my house, she\u2019d taken a chunk out of Damon\u2019s ear with her teeth. I tried to kill her at first, but just as I was about to finalise it I saw in her eyes who she was. \n\nI tried to look for Derek but by that point the workmen had started. Nothing was left of his garden, and nothing was left of Derek. No one\u2019s seen him since. You see, Kat, nothing in that building is totally harmless. You have to be on your guard at all times.\n\nI\u2019ve kept her like this ever since. You may think I\u2019m crazy but I couldn\u2019t kill my own granddaughter. I\u2019m not a monster.\u201d\n\nPrue sighed and ushered me back out of the shed, she locked the door behind us, closing the padlock on her most hideous secret. \n\nI was exhausted. It was a lot of information to take in and as a result of the information I\u2019d received, real grief for my boyfriend was finally settling in. Every hope I had was dashed. I know many of you tried to tell me in the comments that he was gone but I wanted you to be wrong so bad. \n\nI couldn\u2019t bear to look at Prudence Hemmings for another moment. I made my excuses and left, morosely riding the bus back to the tower block I had once been so excited to live in. \n\nIt was mid afternoon by time I got home. The choice between the stairs and lift didn\u2019t strike much enthusiasm into me but I opted for the stairs, and after what I\u2019m sure ended up being 11 flights, I made it the 6 flights up the stairs to my flat. \n\nI laid on our mattress on the floor and sobbed for Jamie. I sobbed so hard my throat went dry and hurt and my stomach cramped with each gasping breath. I sobbed myself to sleep. My body and mind must have given up fighting the need to rest and shut down.\n\nWhen I woke up it was late, about 10pm. I wrote as much of my update as I could for you guys, hit post and just sat at the dining table with my head in my hands. \n\nMy whole life had fallen to shit and I knew it. \n\nI thought about so many things, questioned why they were happening to me. I searched social media for updates on Georgia but there were none. Jamie wasn\u2019t super close with his family but I knew it wasn\u2019t long before they\u2019d start to worry. Everything I considered just snowballed in my mind.\n\nThe loneliness in dealing with this situation was killing me. \n\nI decided to do something I usually wouldn\u2019t. I went downstairs and I knocked on the door of flat 26. \n\nTerri answered. Her perfectly bobbed hair was a little unkempt and out of place, she had huge bags under her eyes and I could smell wine on her breath. \n\n\u201cAre you ok Kat?\u201d She looked concerned. I found it ironic that she looked so disheveled I had forgotten it was me who came for help.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not... I\u2019m sorry... I know I don\u2019t know you ..I ... just...\u201d I could barely speak.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Prue called me. She told me everything. I\u2019m sorry about your boyfriend, it\u2019s a shame I never got to meet him.\u201d Terri stared back at me with the same expression a mother would, warm and understanding. \u201cWould you like a cup of tea, maybe something stronger?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love a coffee please.\u201d I answered meekly, making way way into the living room, her sofa was comfy, it reminded me of being back home at my parents before any of this started. \n\nTerri trotted out to the kitchen, stumbling slightly. I could see the kitchen counter from the sofa, and the empty bottle of wine that accounted for her stumbling. \n\nAs she boiled the kettle there was a huge crash from somewhere inside the flat. I jumped, feeling startled. Terri coughed in a meagre attempt to conceal the noise.\n\n\u201cExcuse me for just a moment please.\u201d She muttered apprehensively as she walked out of the living area and into the hallway containing the bedrooms. \n\nI heard another crash, giggling and some inaudible shouting. After a while things went quiet and Terri came back into the living room. \n\n\u201cSorry about that, kids you know.\u201d She announced, brushing off the noises. I\u2019d almost forgotten about Eddie and Ellie. It was late already and by the resigned expression on Terri\u2019s face indicated that this was how all her nights began. \n\nI nodded. I couldn\u2019t muster up much more of a response. I think she could see that I just needed to sit there. She got up to finish making and then set the cup of tea in front of me with 2 digestive biscuits. I hadn\u2019t eaten properly in days and I really needed the sugar. \n\nIt turned out me and Terri get along really well. We have similar taste in movies, music and food despite the age gap. We spoke for about an hour about random, normal stuff. It was nice to get a break from the madness. I got used to the crashing around from the twins. I even laughed a few times. I\u2019d forgotten what that felt like these past few days.\n\nThe break didn\u2019t last long. The next noise that we heard was louder than the first. It was quickly followed by two small children, running into the living room diving into their mothers arms. \n\nI was taken aback for a moment. Eddie and Ellie were dressed in pyjamas, and were still the cute children that I had met in the hallway, but something was different. Their brown puppy dog eyes had become deep voids, like what I\u2019d imagined when Prue described the window cleaners true form. And at the ends of their fingers were long sharp claws protruding from where nails should be. \n\nI didn\u2019t have time to recoil in terror at their new looks, Terri clutched them and asked what was wrong. They wailed and buried the voids where their eyes should be into their mothers shoulders. Despite their terrifying exterior, these were two very scared little kids. \n\nIt had been a very long day and I thought my nightmare was over but it was only just beginning. Ellie mumbled into Terri\u2019s shoulder, in that high pitched voice kids do when they\u2019re scared.\n\n\u201cMummy, were sorry, we didn\u2019t mean to let them in. We were just teasing...\u201d\n\n\u201cShhh they\u2019re coming!\u201d Hissed Eddie, in the same distressed high pitched tone. \n\n\u201cWho\u2019s... what have you done?\u201d Terri asked, colour drained from her face.\n\nThe kids didn\u2019t get a chance to reply. Terri\u2019s face turned paler than I thought possible. I looked up and standing in the living room doorway were about 10 people, all incredibly average looking. \n\nThey were almost expressionless, they didn\u2019t look angry or pleased to see us. They were dressed in non descriptive clothes. I imagined trying to describe them to one of those artists that draws pictures for the police and I genuinely don\u2019t think even one of them had a distinguishing feature. \n\nThat\u2019s why it took me a while to spot her in the crowd, even though she had been glaring at me the entire time. \n\nNatalia.\n\nHow our confrontation went: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/cjzfky\/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app"},"253":{"title":"My job is to watch a woman trapped in a room.

I like it.  My name is actually Melanie though.\u201d\n\nI felt my face reddening.  Of course her name wasn\u2019t actually Rachel.  That was just something I made up in my head.  Still, my embarrassment couldn\u2019t keep up with my confusion and joy.  \u201cIs it really you?\u201d\n\nShe nodded.  \u201cYeah, it\u2019s me.\u201d\n\nRachel\u2026Melanie grunted as I stepped forward and started hugging her.  Laughing, she hugged me back for a moment, but then she whispered in my ear.  \u201cThomas, we need to talk, and not out here.  Can we go inside?\u201d\n\nI broke away and nodded, wiping at my eyes as I tried to finish unlocking the door with a shaking hand.  My heart was pounding and I still felt like I was in a strange and wonderful dream, but when we had gotten inside and sat down on my living room sofa, I forced myself to focus on the biggest question I had.\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\nMelanie had still been smiling as we sat down, but now she looked worried and sad.  \u201cThomas, that\u2019s what I\u2019m here to tell you.  Things aren\u2019t like you think they are.  They never have been.\u201d\n\nI frowned, a new line of fear cutting through my happy haze.  \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\nShe held the bridge of her nose for a moment, looking down like she was trying to figure out how to say\u2026whatever it was she had to say.  \u201cThomas\u2026you\u2019re part of a psychological experiment.  I\u2019ve been a part of it for longer than you have as one of the actors, and I still don\u2019t know all the details.  I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s run by some government agency, and I know they\u2019re investing a lot of money and time into it, but for what reasons\u2026that I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d\n\nI realized I was wringing my hands.  No, that wasn\u2019t right.  It couldn\u2019t be right.  This was some kind of trick.\n\nMelanie went on.  \u201cWhat I do know is that you\u2019re being watched as a long-term subject.  They have constructed this whole scenario where you do a secret job watching someone\u2026me\u2026who looks like they might be trapped.  They give you instructions and a way of making choices.  You\u2019ve got buttons or something you can choose between, right?\u201d\n\nI nodded weakly, my tongue thick in my throat.  \u201cYeah.  A red one.   And a green one.\u201d\n\nShe sighed and nodded.  \u201cI think they\u2019re testing how much you\u2019ll obey.  What choices you\u2019ll make based off of your morals, your intelligence, and your fear.  It\u2019s interesting, or at least I thought so when I first joined up six years ago.  They\u2019ve never officially given me many details, just the overall gist.  But people talk.  The other actors and me, sometimes we hear things, and we gossip.\u201d  She smiled sadly.  \u201cThat\u2019s what caused me to start feeling bad.\u201d\n\nI interrupted.  \u201cOther actors?\u201d\n\nMelanie\u2019s eyes widened.  \u201cOh shit, yeah.  Sorry.  I think they still call him Mr. Solomon?  And there are others too.\u201d  When I just stared at her, she went on.  \u201cAnyway, for a long time it was just the normal job, right?  I spend six hours a day acting like I\u2019m this trapped girl, mainly faking painting or watching t.v.  You know, boring stuff\u2026\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but interrupt again, hating the hurt trembling in my voice.  \u201cYou fake the painting?  You aren\u2019t really painting those wonderful pictures?\u201d\n\nNow Melanie looked embarassed.  \u201cNo, sorry.  I can\u2019t paint a bit.  I\u2019m a pretty good singer though.\u201d  She tried to smile, but faltered.  Reaching forward, she touched my arm.  \u201cThat\u2019s why they always have the paintings turned where you can\u2019t see them.  They\u2019re already done beforehand.  All you ever see is some blank canvases and\u2026well, when they *want* me to show you something.\u201d  Her expression darkened as she went on.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I had to break the rules and contact you.  When they started doing this hidden message, mind game bullshit, I got worried.  Worried you would take it too serious.  That you could get hurt, or even hurt yourself.  As soon as you left your shift tonight, I talked to one of the guys in the video department.  He told me about how you had reacted.  Showed me how you were still parked down the street from the building.  I drove over\u2014the bedroom set is in a building outside of town.  I saw you sitting in your car, and I almost approached you then, but I was scared of getting caught and fired.  So I parked and waited until I could follow you somewhere else and let you know I was okay.\u201d\n\nShe blinked back tears.  \u201cI\u2019m ashamed to say I almost left a couple of times.  I don\u2019t want to lose this job, and I tried to tell myself you would be okay after a day or two.  I could get them to change the script enough that you felt like I was okay and wouldn\u2019t worry too much.\u201d\n\nI felt an angry heat growing in my chest.  \u201cWell, that\u2019s nice of you.\u201d\n\nShe looked up, her eyes red.  \u201cI know.  I\u2019m a shit.  I\u2019m so sorry.  I was being selfish and cowardly, but I didn\u2019t actually leave.  And then when I saw Charlie leaving the building, saw you running over to talk to him, I knew they were escalating it even further.\u201d\n\n\u201cCharlie?\u201d\n\nMelanie rolled her eyes in frustration.  \u201cShit, yeah.  Sorry.  Charlie Jefferies.  He\u2019s another actor.  In an earlier version of the experiment he actually played Mr. Solomon, but they decided he wasn\u2019t scary enough, so now he\u2019s usually in one of the suits.  He\u2019s actually done that for your version a lot, you just can\u2019t recognize him under all that get-up they wear.\u201d\n\nI kept curling and uncurling my hands on my lap.  It was all too much.  I felt like a pinball going between anger and relief and embarassment and confusion.  \u201cSo all that stuff he told me?  That was all just to scare me?  See how I\u2019d react?\u201d\n\nShe nodded as she sniffled and wiped her nose with the back of her hand.  \u201cYes.  I\u2019m sorry.  That\u2019s why I knew I couldn\u2019t wait any longer to tell you.  I could see how worried and scared you were going back to your car.\u201d\n\nI pulled my arm back from her touch.  \u201cWell, thanks I guess.  At least you stopped me before I went to the police and looked like a joke in front of them too.\u201d  I just wanted her gone, her sympathetic, pitying eyes off of me.  \u201cThanks for stopping by and letting me in on it.\u201d  I tried to make my voice sound hard and unfeeling, but it came out watery instead.  Standing up, I turned away from her so she couldn\u2019t see as I started to cry.  \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2026uh\u2026I need time to think about everything.  It\u2019s\u2026a lot.\u201d\n\nA moment passed and then her hand was on my shoulder.  \u201cThomas, you don\u2019t have anything to be embarrassed about.  They are very good at what they do.  All you did was what you thought was right.  Because you\u2019re a good man.\u201d  I shrugged.\n\n\u201cI thought that you were in trouble and I wanted to help.\u201d\n\nShe gently turned me toward her, and when I looked up, she smiled and sniffed again.  \u201cI know, but you need to realize, most people wouldn\u2019t have tried to help.  Not when it meant giving up their job or risking themselves like that.  Not for a stranger.\u201d\n\nI wiped at my face as I looked away.  \u201cWell, I still feel dumb, but I\u2019m glad it\u2019s not real.  I\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay.  That we both are.\u201d  I paused and caught her eye again.  \u201cWe are, aren\u2019t we?  Safe, I mean.\u201d\n\nShe hesitated before nodding.  \u201cYeah, I think so.  Like I said, they have a lot invested in whatever this is, and the fact that they\u2019re willing to go as far as they have with you makes me wonder, but I\u2019ve never seen any signs of anyone getting hurt.  I think the worst that could happen is one or both of us gets fired.\u201d\n\nI felt my face getting red again.  \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about that.  I\u2019m going to quit tomorrow.  I\u2019ll finally get to hit their damn buttons.  Maybe both of them.\u201d  I started to smile, but then I saw the look on Melanie\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cThomas, please don\u2019t do that.  I don\u2019t think they would hurt us, but if you up and quit, they\u2019ll figure out I\u2019ve talked to you.  I don\u2019t think they watch us all the time, but I don\u2019t know what they can find out.  You know, tracking cellphones, spy satellites, whatever.  I\u2019m taking a big risk just being here, and I don\u2019t want them catching on.\u201d\n\nI took a step back from her.  \u201cSo you want to keep getting paid to trick people like me.\u201d\n\nShe reached out and grabbed my right hand.  I had been clenching it unconsciously, and it relaxed at her touch.  \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to.  But I wasn\u2019t expecting this.  How the experiment has changed, getting to actually meet you\u2026I can\u2019t do it long-term, but another month or two to save up money?  Now that you\u2019re in on it and won\u2019t be scared or hurt by it any more?\u201d  She smiled.  \u201cThat I can do.  That we can *both* do.  We can keep going like normal, take some more of their money, and then one of us can quit.  The next month, the other one can.  How does that sound?\u201d\n\nI shrugged uncertainly.  It made some sense, and once I had calmed down, it would probably make more.  She gave my hand a squeeze.\n\n\u201cAnd when this is all over, I want to get to know you better.  I know I\u2019ve been playing a role, but for the most part, that\u2019s been me you\u2019ve been watching all this time.  I think it\u2019s only fair I get to see more of you too.\u201d  She blushed.  \u201cAssuming you\u2019re interested in that.\u201d\n\nI felt my hand growing clammy in hers as my stomach fluttered.  \u201cWell, I mean\u2026yeah.  Yeah, I would really like that.\u201d  Swallowing, I added, \u201cHow long do we have to wait to see each other again?\u201d\n\nMelanie grinned at me.  \u201cWork another month or so.  Save what you can.  And then quit.  I\u2019ll wait another two or three weeks, and then I\u2019ll do the same.  And then\u2026\u201d  She looked up at the ceiling as she pondered it for a moment, and I was struck again by how beautiful she was, even if she was a little different in person than I had imagined.  \u201d\u2026three months from tonight we\u2019ll meet right here.  I\u2019ll come over and we can start getting to know each other better.  How\u2019s that sound?\u201d\n\nReturning her smile, I nodded.  \u201cThat sounds great.\u201d  \n\n****\n\nWhen she left a couple of minutes later, part of me hated to see her go, but another part was relieved.  I was so exhausted, and while I was so happy she was okay and we had finally met, I felt like the burned up wire in an old lightbulb.  I needed time alone.  Time to think and calm down, and most of all, time to rest.\n\nI didn\u2019t really even remember falling asleep, and when I woke up, I realized my alarm had been buzzing for over thirty minutes.  I jumped up and raced to get to my shift at work.  As she had been leaving, Melanie had stressed again how we needed to act completely the same.  That meant not freaking out, but it also meant not acting like everything was okay either.  If I suddenly showed no signs of being worried about her, that would tip them off too.  I promised and she left after a brief hug and kiss.  Remembering that now, through the haze of my tiredness the night before, it felt like a dream.\n\nStill, I went into the surveillance room with a much lighter heart.  I didn\u2019t have to worry or feel guilty any more about not helping her, and there was some satisfaction in finally pulling one over on the people that had tricked me for so long.  Besides, in three months I would be done with this place and get to see Ra\u2026Melanie again.  In person, at least.\n\nBecause I got to watch her on the video feed as soon as I came into work.  She was asleep when I first got there, and I found myself wondering if she was as tired as I still felt.  When she woke up later and started reading a book, I found myself beginning to smile and had to stop myself.  I should still be worried acting, not smiling like I had a crush.  I had to do better so Melanie didn\u2019t get in trouble.\n\nAn hour or so later she started working on another of \u201cher\u201d paintings.  Watching her work, I was amazed at how real it all looked.  It was hard to see everything from my angle, but I would have sworn she had paint on those brushes and was really painting whatever was on the canvas.  I found myself feeling proud of her.  She really was a great actress.  Not only didn\u2019t I see her giving any clues that we had met or talked, but she really did seem different in the room than she had in my apartment.  I supposed that was what she had meant by \u201cplaying a role\u201d. \n\nI was almost at the end of my shift, and while I hated to leave her, I had to admit that I was ready for some more sleep.  Trying to guard my reactions all day had been exhausting, and I was dreading the next few weeks.  But then I realized she was done painting.  I expected her to just go and do something else, but instead she picked up the canvas at its edges and carefully walked it over to the sofa.  Her body was blocking it at first, but then she stepped aside.\n\nIt was a painting of a massive tree.  The bark was a dark red, with a huge twisting trunk that broke off into a dozen branches.  Those branches were covered in leaves that were so deep green they almost reminded me of storm clouds more than the top of a tree.  Like all the paintings, I felt touched by it, even now that Melanie had told me she didn\u2019t paint them.  The images themselves, combined with the colors and the small details\u2026they really were amazing.  \n\nJust like this one.  If you looked close enough, you could see that there were several small blackbirds in the branches of the tree.  It was funny, but they almost looked like they were\u2026\n\nIt almost looked like they were made out of words.\n\nI felt my heart start to hammer and I forced myself to stay calm.  No point in being silly.  I knew it was all a game now, and I just had to play my part a little while longer.  Still, the worried me would want to know what the words said, so I might as well try to read them.  I squinted, following the birds right to left and top to bottom.\n\n**That**\n&nbsp;\n\n**girl**\n&nbsp;\n\n**isn\u2019t**\n&nbsp;\n\n**me**\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI looked away from the painting to see Rachel staring up at me.  She looked terrified.\n\n[*Oh no.*](https:\/\/redd.it\/9ndww5)\n\n****\n\n[Part Four](https:\/\/redd.it\/btkvkl)"},"254":{"title":"The Monster Under your Bed isn't Always there to Scare You","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/7xhpsm\/the_monster_under_your_bed_isnt_always_there_to\/","flair":null,"author":"lifeisstrangemetoo","selftext":"I was lying alone in my room when I heard the voice, deep and crackly, coming from beneath my bed.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d the voice called out.\n\nI told myself I was just imagining it. \n\n\u201cHey kid,\u201d the voice repeated.\n\nI drew my knees up to my chest and ducked my head under the blanket, trying to shut out the voice and the cold wind that drifted in through the window, ruffling the curtains.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the monster underneath your bed,\u201d the voice replied.\n\n\u201cYou mean you\u2019re real?\u201d I asked. \n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d the monster said. \u201cOf course I\u2019m real.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you have a name?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cOf course I have a name.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh... well what is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cFrank.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrank?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d the monster said. \u201cIs there something wrong with that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. I mean, I don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not very monster-ly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell my parents didn\u2019t want me to be a monster.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?

I wanted to ask him what he meant, but I fell silent as I heard a rustling coming from the closet. The door creaked open, and I could hear soft footsteps padding towards me across the bedroom floor. I didn\u2019t dare peek out of the blanket. The footsteps stopped, and I could hear heavy breathing next to me. I squeezed my eyes tight.\n\nThe warm sanctuary of the blanket disappeared as it was yanked off me.\n\nI hugged my arms around my knees and prepared for the worst. A scream shattered the night air, followed by the sound of breaking glass. I opened my eyes a crack to see a knife lying on the carpet next to my bed, blade glinting in the moonlight.\n\nMy parents rushed into the room and asked me what had happened, but I didn\u2019t know what to say, only that someone had been hiding in my closet and they\u2019d jumped out the window. \n\nMy parents called 911, and the police came right away. They picked up a man called Gary Thompson sprinting through the streets a couple blocks away. He was covered in blood and broken glass. They found Gary\u2019s car abandoned on our property, and inside they found duct tape, knives, barbiturates and a video camera. \n\nFrom what I heard Gary\u2019s lawyer employed an insanity defense, and Gary is currently incarcerated in a state mental facility for the criminally insane. \n\nI never heard from Frank the monster again, but the officer who arrested Gary told me that he sleeps on the floor of the facility.\n\nHe tells the doctors that he\u2019s terrified of Frank, the monster under his bed.\n\n[x](http:\/\/davidmaloneystories.com)"},"255":{"title":"I found an extremely bizarre internet survey","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/8kalgj\/i_found_an_extremely_bizarre_internet_survey\/","flair":null,"author":"Mr_Outlaw_","selftext":"Nobody knows what rock bottom truly is until they've hit it. \n\nBeing abruptly fired from a job you've worked at for the past ten years, and then catching your girl cheating on you with your replacement really makes a man think. \n\nHell, *my student loans aren't even paid off yet*.\n\nWhat a shitshow this life is. \n\nAfter a rather boozy night that consisted of sending out about four dozen resumes and horrendously written cover letters, I passed out. \n\nWhen I woke up the next morning, I decided to at least *try* and make some money at home while waiting for an interview. \n\nAt that moment, I thought that the best way to go about it was completing those internet surveys that yielded 5 dollar subway gift cards and other shit like that after about an hour of answering questions. I mean, I didn't have any other marketable skills that could've yielded immediate income. \n\nIt was either that or wasting the day away playing computer games. At least I wouldn't have to pay for food. \n\nI did these surveys for about 5 hours before nearly passing out. It was way more excruciating then I'd originally anticipated. At the end of those 5 hours, I'd accumulated about $45 in cash and gift cards. \n\n$9 an hour. Not like I was making much more than that before. I was about to close my laptop up for the day and head to a bar in an attempt drown out my melancholy when I first saw it. \n\nIt shouldn't even have been noticeable... but for one reason or another, it was. At the bottom corner of the website that I was on, existed a tiny, singular advertisement. Maybe it was the simplicity that got me. Plain black letters in a tacky font that read \"Surveys for cash\" overlapped a completely white background. \n\nAt least they were direct with the message. *One more couldn't hurt*, I thought. Might as well scrape together a little bit more booze money before heading out.  \n\nI sat back down, clicked on the picture link and prepared myself to grind through some more painstaking inquires. The first few questions were simple enough. I guess they weren't really questions, but more data collection. My name, age and occupation. I thought it was kind of weird that they also asked my height and weight, but it wasn't unheard of. \n\nThe first **real** question was a different story though. I must have stared at it, eyes wide and mouth agape, for god knows how long. \n\n*What the actual hell?*\n\nIn plain English, this is what popped up on my screen: \"How strong is your urge to currently look behind you?\" \n\nThere were five options below, ranging from \"Not at all\" to \"overwhelming\". \n\nThere was no feasible reason why I should've been afraid at that moment. *But I was*. I tightened my breathing, trying to make out any subtle noises behind me. There were none. After maybe about five minutes, I worked up the courage to look. There was nothing. I sighed in relief and scoffed at myself at the same time. \n\nThis must have been some kind of joke. However, I decided to entertain it, answering \"neutral\" and clicking onto the next question. This is what it read: \"Why would you look behind you?\" \n\nI smirked. *Funny*, before simply typing in a \"I don't know\" in the response box and once again clicking next. This was the 3rd question: \"You're on a plane. Apart from you, there is only one other passenger, who is sitting somewhere behind you. At some point, you get up to go to the washroom, and find that the man is gone. You check to see if he is in the only bathroom on the plane, but he isn't. What do you do?\"\n\nAgain, I must have stupidly stared at it for nearly ten minutes. Was this some kind of obscure personality test? I mean, it must have been, right? *Right?* \n\nI put the same answer that I used for the last question: \"I don't know.\" It was true. I didn't know. How was I *supposed to* answer this shit? \n\nI click next again, now more intrigued than anything. The 4th question went like this: \"You wake up in woods unfamiliar to you. It's nighttime, and the moonlight provides you with only slight visibility. About thirty feet away from you, there is a small, dimly illuminated cabin. The door is open, and a smiling woman is motioning for you to come in. Do you go? Explain why.\" \n\nThis question wasn't necessarily weirder than the last one, so my conjecture that this was some kind of odd personality test was still feasible. I actually make an attempt to answer this one, something along the lines of going into the cabin because there's simply nowhere else to go. \n\nOnce again, I click next. Probably shouldn't have. \n\nThe questions started getting *fucked up*. They weren't too gory or explicit, not anything like that. They were just stranger. Weirder. More psychologically disturbing. If you're wondering why the hell I kept going, I can't really give you an explicit answer to that. I just felt like I *had to*. It was an esoteric, creeping sensation that I can't quite explain away. But I could never shake it. So I just went on. \n\nSome of the questions that stood out were:\n\n\"Suppose that you wake up one night to find an elevator in your house. During every midnight after that, it opens up for five minutes, revealing an exact copy of yourself that gets progressively more injured as time goes on. Do you keep living like this? Or do you enter the elevator once and end it all?\"\n\nAnd:\n\n\"You're in a hotel room but are awoken by a rapid knocking at your window. You peek through the blinds, seeing what appears to be a man missing both his eyes. He puts his mouth to the glass and tells you to kill the woman in the bathroom immediately. Do you listen to him?\" \n\nThis was one of my least favorites:\n\n\"You are watching home videos with your mother. One of the tapes include footage of her being murdered by a masked intruder. Your mother simply laughs at this footage without saying anything. In your opinion, is this a cause for concern?\" \n\nIn addition to this insanity-inducing shit, there were some rather disconcerting events happening in *real life* as well. I received a knock at the door about thirty minutes in. I looked through my peephole to find a guy standing there, frantically shaking his head and mouthing \"no\" while making direct eye contact with me. He looked terrified. Obviously, I didn't open up. \n\nI received about ten phone calls from somebody named \"the auditor\" on my caller ID. They left a message every time, but each one was just a recording that consisted of somebody saying numbers through heavy static. Actually, it sounded more like *screaming* now that I think about it.\n\nAbout an hour into this thing, and I was on the verge of a mental breakdown. I was petrified of looking behind me, even though there was no indication that anything should've been there. I heard some soft scratching coming from my vent at one point, so I moved my couch over it. \n\nEventually, I reached what appeared to be the end of the survey. However, it wasn't a question. It was simply a statement. \n\n\"Don't let them in. They're not to be trusted.\" \n\nAlmost as if it were on cue, I heard more knocking at my door about five seconds after reading this. As slowly and silently as I could, I moved over and looked through the peephole once again. It was a different person than the one I'd seen earlier. She was a woman, looking to be in her mid twenties. She was wearing a thick blazer, despite it being around 90 Fahrenheit outside. She was also wearing sunglasses, so I could never really tell where she was actually looking. She eventually took a piece of paper out of her pocket and slipped it under the door. \n\nI look down and read it. \n\n\"It's lying. Leave your apartment immediately.\" \n\nIt's been about half an hour since. I can't bring myself to look at the computer screen nor at the woman outside. She's still there. I can see the shadows of her feet from underneath my door. I heard my bedroom window open a few minutes ago, but I've since jammed the door shut with a chair. I can hear some kind of distorted muttering coming from behind it now. \n\nMaybe rock bottom wasn't so bad. \n\n*But what the fuck am I supposed to do here?* "},"256":{"title":"I\u2019ve been squatting in a condemned high rise. These are the rules I follow to stay safe.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/xyx284\/ive_been_squatting_in_a_condemned_high_rise_these\/","flair":"Child Abuse","author":"ChristianWallis","selftext":"I\u2019m not homeless.\n\nI have a home. I just don\u2019t own it. But it\u2019s mine and I work to keep it. Every city has its fair share of abandoned buildings to squat in, but usually you gotta deal with either cops or shitty neighbours. The Annedale High Rise has neither. Police stay away, so do the locals. As a stranger from out of town I stumbled across the place on my first night in the city and thought it a little strange that a 28 story tower block had been left to rot. Every window black. Every light in the courtyard smashed. No cars in the lot. No booth for a guard. Not even barbed wire on the fence. Barely half-a-mile from a playground filled with shouting drunken teenagers but none of them strayed in the direction of Annedale. No fires or music or bottles hurtling through the air. It was silent.\n\nInside, I found that the lobby had been torn to shit. Double doors ripped open and left that way for what looked like years. Easy access for the curious, but I was the only one there. Most of the first story had collapsed. Waterlogged ceiling tiles turned to mulch by shitty British weather. I know water is invasive, but it had practically fucking colonised the place so bad algae was growing up the walls. Even the elevator shaft was flooded. My own reflection looking back at me as I peered through brackish water and caught a glimpse of the old rusted carriage just a few feet below. I couldn\u2019t help but think about standing on top of it, waist high, and reaching down to pull open the emergency hatch. Only natural to wonder what was down there. Little metal box soaking in pitch black water for years and years. I thought about pressing the button, calling it up and seeing the elevator rise in spite of all logic. An image I still think of from time to time.\n\nMeanwhile the empty shaft loomed above, cables whistling in the wind. I\u2019ve learned not to linger by it. If you look up you\u2019ll sometimes see something ducking out of the way, pulling its head through the doors before you get a good look. It finds it awfully funny, even tries to make a game out of it, like peekaboo. Play too much though and it starts to pop up elsewhere. Any open door becomes an invitation. Sent more than a few people running for their lives in the middle of the night, but bad news for them. That thing is more than free to leave this place if it\u2019s part of a game.\n\nIf you ask about Annedale most people just shrug or laugh. Kids\u2019ll talk about it same way they talk about any haunted house. Difference is no one dares anyone to go up there. No one uses it to get pissed or high. No one sneaks into the basement to have a risky little fuck. No one hides their stashes there. It has all the hallmarks of your classic urban legend, only people *actually* stay away. They\u2019ll laugh and joke and tell scary stories, but they treat the soil its on like it houses a radioactive leak. And the council, I\u2019m surprised they haven\u2019t knocked it down but they, out of everyone in the city, have the most to lose by talking about it.\n\nThey built it in the mid fifties as government housing. Only a lot of the young mothers who moved in there found their children\u2019s health taking a turn for the worse. Started with newborns. Babies that wouldn\u2019t wake after a peaceful night\u2019s sleep. The kinda deaths that got written off as either negligence or abuse, screaming teenage girls hauled off to prison on the words of doctors who didn\u2019t give a shit. It\u2019s always the mother\u2019s fault in some people\u2019s eyes, and these girls had no one to stand up for them. Two in the first year, four in the next, and they kept on coming for every year until it closed.\n\nWasn\u2019t until 1982 that someone traced the source of deaths to tainted water storage on the roof. Toxic metals leeching into the supply. Not enough to kill an adult, but bad news for anyone with weak immune systems. Thirty eight women had been imprisoned by then. Another twenty three had killed themselves before they could be sentenced. And those are just the ones accounted for. Not all the deaths were from the water. Annedale has a way of being bad for any child\u2019s health, no matter the circumstance.\n\nMore than a few toddlers starved to death as their parents rotted in the tub from an overdose. Even more were lost when they found their parent\u2019s stash, little bodies wracked with agonising fits as their panicked mothers screamed for help. One tripped down the elevator shaft because the doors opened as if the carriage was right there. And those are the ones who were found. Plenty more went missing, written off as runaways. In the end Annedale\u2019s reputation as a cursed place got so bad the only way out was to shut the whole thing down. Board it up. Erase it from the records. Pretend it never happened and just forget.\n\nBut Annedale kept on killing even after the doors were officially shut. If anything it only got nastier. Talked to one cop who told me he found a guy dead from sepsis on the sixth floor couple years after the place was shut down. No one could fucking believe it. They reckon this guy scratched himself on a nail and caught gangrene like it was the 1800s. Never went to the hospital. Just laid there and died slowly and painfully as the infection spread, but not before he took every last bit of furniture in the room and shoved it against the door. Strange enough on its own, but it was the flag he\u2019d made out of his own clothes that freaked everyone out. He\u2019d scrawled *HELP* on it, like he wanted to get someone\u2019s attention down below even though the lock was on his side. He could\u2019ve left anytime he wanted.\n\nCop I spoke to said he was there when they kicked the door down. Still remembers the look in dead man\u2019s eyes. He was glaring at the door two days after he\u2019d passed, white knuckled fists gripping a blanket that smelled sickly sweet from all that infection.\n\nThere were others too. Lots of people falling, many of them without a good reason. Got so bad they bricked the roof door but by the time I arrived someone had cleared it all away with a sledge hammer. I still don\u2019t hang out up there. Not after I first went up and saw pale fingers gripping the ledge, like someone was hanging off it and holding on for dear life. I reckon a lotta people see something like that and think a person needs their help. They go rushing over to offer a hand. But when I saw it something about those grimy nails set alarm bells off in my head. Fingers looked all wrong. So I took my coat off and used a broom handle to move it closer to the ledge. Sure enough those ugly hands snatched at the coat and ripped it outta my hands, sending it hurtling to the parking lot below. I\u2019ve thought about taking a closer look from time to time, but I got a thing about heights and could never bring myself to investigate it much further.\n\nYou\u2019d think I\u2019d leave, but it\u2019s my home. I own it as much as it owns me. People even refer to me as the caretaker now like they forgot I wasn\u2019t always here. Police treat me the same, can you believe that? Any reports of a break in and they call me on my number to go take a look, like I\u2019m some sort of official. Only other guy who was here as long as me was the philosopher. I don\u2019t know his name, just call him that because of the books he left behind. He came here back when the block was still just a place to live and he stuck around for a few years after its closure. Lots of notebooks in his flat. Thousands of pages talking about child sacrifice made to gods who don\u2019t like being named, along with pictures of strange things frozen in ice and medical photos that look fake.\n\nAt first I thought he came to document the curse. He has dozens of books just recording all the strange things he saw, like birds with too many wings or milk that turned to clotted blood in the bottle. But after going through every thing he owned I found letters to a wife who\u2019d died in childbirth. He kept her death certificate way at the back of an old looking box filled with the letters he\u2019d kept writing her long after the date.\n\nAnother box, just a row over, had the letters she\u2019d written back. Awful things scrawled on random scraps, shit and blood for ink. He dated them himself and sometimes wrote notes about how they came to him.\n\n*Delivered by a rat that was cannibalised in front of me.*\n\n*Pulled by my dentist from a cavity in my mouth.*\n\n*Written in the web of a spider with thirteen legs.*\n\nAnyway, he gives away the real reason he moved to Annedale in one of the letters. Says that Annedale was the key to helping her, that he was weeks away from figuring out how to open the door. Told his wife he\u2019d bring her back. Told her he knew how. I\u2019ve never figured out where he went next or what happened to him, but his apartment was locked when I found it and likely would\u2019ve stayed that way if the key hadn\u2019t turned up in my inside pocket on the first morning. Now I live in his old place. It\u2019s safe in there. He\u2019s written things on the wall that keep everything well behaved. Symbols that I don\u2019t understand but which are easy to trace so that\u2019s what I do. I go over them every couple of months and so far they\u2019ve kept me safe and sane.\n\nBecause you do need protection in Annedale. I don\u2019t know when in its history the curse went from something mundane to something very real and very dark. It wasn\u2019t all just bad luck or poverty, not by the end and certainly not anymore. You can\u2019t just go strolling around Annedale, certainly not at night. It\u2019s dangerous. For one thing, it attracts a constant rotation of the deeply unwell who are likely to attack on sight, if you\u2019re luckly. They usually turn up dead in the halls come morning, although sometimes it\u2019s just bits of them that I come across. Strips of skin floating on the brackish water that floods the basement stairwell, or bloodied fingernails embedded in the ceiling plaster. Weirdest one was a single tooth in a lightbulb, bloody gum still attached to the root, the glass all around it somehow intact.\n\nMany of them come here with business, something a little like the philosopher\u2019s. Rituals. Bargains. Things like that. It\u2019s not a good idea to interrupt them, or to give them even the slightest hint you might be a problem. Every night I lock my door and wait for Annedale\u2019s business to finish and come morning I do a sweep, floor by floor, and clean up whatever\u2019s left of the tower block\u2019s strange pilgrims.\n\nMost of the rituals don\u2019t look real to me. In fact, I reckon a lotta people who come here just end up as victims of something or someone else. There are a *lot* of reasons to stay out of Annedale at night, and most of its visitors strike me as a little na\u00efve. Most of what I see looks like it got stolen from a bad death metal album. I once found a book called \u201cSatanism and Witchcraft in the 21st Century\u201d. It\u2019s hard to imagine that the secret inner workings of the universe can be found in something with an ISBN number and 3000 Amazon reviews. Of course, not all attempts at exploiting Annedale\u2019s energy are so hackneyed. I had one guy turn up at my door and pay me three grand in cash just to show him the darkest corner in the building. I wasn\u2019t sure what he meant at first. Thought he meant light and shadow.\n\n\u201cSort of,\u201d he replied when I explained this to him. \u201cDarkness like that can be part of it. But I\u2019m looking for a corner, has to be a right angle or more acute. Ideally, more acute. You understand that term right?\u201d\n\nHe\u2019d seemed arrogant and that last sentence confirmed as much. Good looking guy in his late twenties, nice suit. Looked like the stereotypical banker. Acted like one too.\n\n\u201cPlenty of places like that,\u201d I said. \u201cLots of funny rooms in Annedale. People trying to make the most of limited space. Sometimes the walls meet at tight angles, sure. But I don\u2019t know what you mean about dark. There\u2019s the basement. It\u2019s flooded. Can\u2019t think of anywhere darker than that.\u201d\n\nHe bit his lip and hesitated for a second or two, as if he was actually contemplating it.\n\n\u201cNot a bad suggestion actually, but no, too difficult to reach. And I don\u2019t just mean dark as in the absence of light. I mean dark like under the bed. Dark like that one chip in a wall that leads to a hollow space between the bricks and as a child you can\u2019t help but wonder what lives there. Somewhere that just inexplicably feels\u2026 like it\u2019s not got as much of God\u2019s attention on it as everywhere else.\u201d\n\nI thought about this for a second. His words were vague but damn if I didn\u2019t know what he meant.\n\n\u201cA corner?\u201d I asked. \u201cHas to be an acute corner?\u201d\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\u201cI think I know the place,\u201d I said and he smiled like real creep.\n\nI took him to a flat on the eighth floor. It was rundown like everywhere else but there was still enough of its old furniture lying around. You can pull open random drawers in there and still see the cutlery people once used. There\u2019s even an old analogue TV on an old stand. You can perch on what\u2019s left of the sofa and stare at that TV and get the feeling you knew the people who lived there once. Run your thumb over the dials on the toaster, the handle of the fridge, or the yellowing plastic of a light switch, and feel an aching loss that creeps up on you out of nowhere.\n\nLook up and you\u2019ll see that the light fixture has been torn out of the ceiling, like someone had tried swinging from it.\n\nNot a big place, by the way. Three rooms. A bedroom with a double bed all rumpled up. A living room slash kitchen. And a tiny little spare room that looked like it once would have been used for storage, or a washing machine maybe, *if* you were single and childless. A slither of space, a triangle carved out of whatever room was left over when other more important walls had been put up. That sofa I mentioned, the TV, they were all placed so whoever was sat down could always keep an eye on that room and its contents.\n\nYou see they\u2019d put a cot inside and it\u2019s still there, bluebottle flies circling overhead. You can\u2019t see inside the cot, not unless you went in and actually pulled the blankets out but it\u2019s been decades and no one has managed it yet. It\u2019s dark behind those old blankets, a heavy shadow that dissuades a closer look, like there\u2019s something in there no one needs to see and it\u2019s spent a long time sat there eating what little light there was. Even with a window in that room, daylight doesn\u2019t really filter down.\n\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d the businessman said when he saw it. He gazed around the flat one detail at a time, his head pausing for a moment and a smile creeping across his face as he laid his eyes on the broken light fixture. And the cot, the sight of it, the flies that still circled above faded Winnie the Pooh blankets, it made the breath catch in his throat.\n\n\u201cOh this is\u2026 *yes* this is good,\u201d he told me. \u201cDark like under the bed. You\u2019ve earned that money. I could have had a dozen men sweep this place and they wouldn\u2019t have understood the brief as well as you have.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I replied even if that wasn\u2019t really how I felt.\n\nQuietly the man sat down and began to unpack his leather satchel. No pentagrams to be found, although he did unpack seven strange looking candles. He caught me looking at them and smiled.\n\n\u201cHome made,\u201d he said. \u201cEach one shaped by my hands. I\u2019m not a good artist, but it\u2019s the effort that counts. Took forever to rend the wax. Of course that was the easy part. The hard part was getting the fat to make it. Did you know there can be a surprisingly high level of security around a hospital\u2019s medical waste department?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d I replied as he took out some flimsy bits of wood and a few small nails. He oh so carefully began to nail the splinters of wood together into what looked like random shapes.\n\n\u201cOh well,\u201d he sighed after a few quiet moments, his fingers nimbly gripping the tiny hammer as he tapped away. Already he\u2019d put together at least six of the strange little wooden polygons, and with each new one I felt a strange sensation. \u201cWould you like to stay and watch?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d I answered.\n\nHe stopped tapping and smiled once more.\n\n\u201cOh you\u2019re clever,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the correct answer, by the way. And if I\u2019m to respect it, I should inform you that now is the safest time to leave.\u201d\n\nI made my way to the exit just as he lit the first candles, but not before I looked towards the cot one last time. I was surprised to see a hollow blackness that extended beyond the doorway, like a curtain had been draped across it, only there was depth to it that drew the eye. The businessman paid it no attention, but after a few more seconds he eventually looked up at me expectantly.\n\n\u201cCan I ask what is it you want?\u201d I said. \u201cEveryone who comes here, I don\u2019t get the sense it ever works out for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for a new kind of afterlife,\u201d he replied.\n\n\u201cDo you need one?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all need one,\u201d he said with a wry chuckle. \u201cBut only those of us willing to take a few risks will get a better deal. Everyone else\u2026\u201d He grimaced. \u201cIt\u2019s worth the bother. But look who I\u2019m speaking to.\u201d\n\nHe looked to the darkness that enveloped the doorway. Shapes could be seen floating past.\n\n\u201cYou should leave now,\u201d he said.\n\nI pulled the door shut and, noticing that the sun was rapidly setting, ran to my apartment where I knew the walls would keep me safe.\n\nWhen I returned the next day the man\u2019s satchel was still where I\u2019d last seen it, propped against one arm of the sofa. The candles had burned down to the very end of the wicks and left a lingering smell that\u2019s still there all these years later. And of the man himself, well in the room with the cot\u2014which still has bluebottle flies orbiting overhead\u2014there is now a shadow burned into the wall. It\u2019s blurry and diffused, but vaguely recognisable as a man on his knees, his head pressed to the floor in a gesture of supplication.\n\nI\u2019ve known it to occasionally move, to turn its head and look towards me at which my point my temples throb, my ears pop, and a darkness begins to encroach upon the edges of my vision. I never exactly considered that flat to be Disneyland before, but now I avoid it like the plague.\n\nStill, it could be worse. Not every ritual ends so cleanly and at times I\u2019ve had to personally intervene, something I hate bitterly. If people want to go poking around in the universe\u2019s undercarriage that\u2019s their business. It\u2019s one thing if I\u2019ve got to sweep what\u2019s left of them up afterwards but at least that\u2019s a one and done job. Sometimes it isn\u2019t so clean. One guy turned up and told me he\u2019d be a new \u201cresident\u201d, my neighbour, and we\u2019d get to know each other. A bumbling old man with an upper class accent and the look of a professor who was down on his luck. He set up in the room next to mine and no matter how little I spoke to him, he never really got the hint and kept trying to act like a good friend. Few times I did initiate conversation it was to tell him the place he\u2019d chosen didn\u2019t have much in the way of protection. He pointed to some funny little rashes and told me *they* were his protection.\n\nOver the next few weeks I\u2019d bump into him from time to time, always on his hands and knees, scraping some dank corner or mouldy pile of bumpy growths. He collected fungi, told me on the first day, and I\u2019d often see him wiping his samples onto petri dishes that he whispered quiet words to whenever he thought I wasn\u2019t around. I don\u2019t think he was sane, but he probably wasn\u2019t completely barmy because he lived long enough to get a sense of Annedale and only come out in the day. Meanwhile his apartment filled up with a growing collection of chittering terrariums and pickle jars, their specimens hidden by murky fluids. All over, he planted and cultivated strange mushrooms and moulds. Encouraged them to soak up the darkness of Annedale and set them to grow in the rife conditions he\u2019d cultivated.\n\nTowards the end his living room had mushrooms growing out the walls. Plaster crumbling beneath microbial armies until there was only concrete and rebar, and even then mould continued to grow and thrive. A few times I peered in and found him feeding meat to the frilly growths that exploded out of the old furniture. During this time the symbols on our shared wall would often grow hot, and I found myself having to replace them on a nearly daily basis as he tinkered away on the other side. I asked him once or twice to tone it down.\n\n\u201cThis is important work,\u201d he growled, an unseen darkness creeping into his voice. \u201cI\u2019m not some ditzy crackhead trying to summon the Baphomet! I\u2019m not looking to get *high*. This is science. Progress! That is what I am working towards.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah well your progress is trying to eat its way into my flat. Can you ask it to stop?\u201d\n\nHe stopped, froze in mid gesture like I\u2019d said something either profoundly stupid or insightful, or likely a bit of both. He looked at the rashes on his arms that had, by now, started to sprout some of their own strange fruit. When he finally spoke again it was sly, like a lecherous old man propositioning a nurse.\n\n\u201cThis fungi,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had samples of it in the university for thirty years! Can you imagine? They never even realised what they had until I found it and unlocked its potential. Now I\u2019ve finally found the source and I can do things no one else thought possible. This entire time my thesis has depended upon the idea that the fungus has\u2026 a capacity for information processing way beyond anything we\u2019ve considered before. And your idea is a good one, you know? Asking it just might be an option\u2026\u201d\n\nHe scuttled off without another word and for the next few days he set about the building like a furious little honey bee in Spring. Poking and prodding, setting trap after trap and cleaning them vigorously of any rats or mice he caught. When I did my morning sweeps I\u2019d find him hovering over Annedale\u2019s latest victims, scraping what was left of them into transparent bags for his own purposes.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind me,\u201d he\u2019d mutter. \u201cIt\u2019s worthless to you, but these poor souls could help me achieve great things.\u201d\n\nThis persisted for another month. He no longer scraped mould or mushrooms off old apartments. He became interested only in meat, and by the time it came to an end I can say confidently that I have never smelled anything worse than the prickly musty odour that wafter out from under his locked door. It became so bad that I began to wonder if I might have to ask for police help and have him removed when, finally, he simply disappeared from Annedale\u2019s halls. One morning he was there, annoyingly shooing me out of the way as he lowered jars into the flooded basement, and then the next he was gone and Annedale\u2019s halls were silent once more.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t mean he had moved out. Far from it, actually.\n\nIt took two days before I decided to just go ahead and break his door down. I kicked at it with a short sharp blow only to find my leg immediately disappeared through wood that had the texture of sodden cardboard. I freed my foot and tried a different tactic, grabbing the handle and pulling so hard that it simply *popped* right out of the rancid wooden frame. Free to move, the door swung open with an eerie creak and fetid air, hot and damp, blew out of the room.\n\nInside I found that the man\u2019s specimens had gone wild. Terrariums had shattered, their contents spilling outwards. Frogs as large as footballs glared at me from behind furry fronds, and insects with human eyes scuttled away before the amphibians could snatch them up. In one corner rats had built a hive out of old cardboard, their backs covered with fungal growths that resembled human fingers and other appendages. In another corner something that looked a little like a black rubber sheet slapped furiously at passing vermin and it took me a few seconds to realise it was a slime mould. When it finally caught something it dragged the strange creature squealing into the dark corner where it grew and constricted around its meal like a fist. I stared at it horrified until one by one black orbs unveiled itself from within the strange mass and I realised it had eyes to stare right back at me.\n\nIt was a cacophony of God awful terror, so gripping that it kept me from hearing the muffled noise of a human struggling to speak. Eventually it did reach my ears and I used my torch to light up the far wall without having to actually step inside.\n\nI found the scientist half-grown into the wall. Algae and moss coated him head-to-toe so that he was no longer recognisable, but I had to assume it could be no one else. Wide eyes glared at me with terror and pain as nasty little critters nibbled away at what was left of his shins, meanwhile strange tendrils probed at his ears and head, never resting for a moment. He kept trying to speak, but the algal growths kept driving their way into his mouth until, one-by-one, they pushed too far and something snapped. His eyes went wider still, his squeals became hysterical, and his jaw slowly slid further down his chest until it hit the floor with a sodden thump.\n\n\u201cFinally made contact?\u201d I asked. \u201cAn awful idea if I\u2019ve heard one. What would a mushroom have to say even in the best of circumstances? Let alone one that was grown in the ruins of Annedale? I can only assume you never got around to telling it to stay off my wall, did you? No you probably had your own reason or doing all of this and that\u2019s what took priority.\u201d\n\nThat made me wonder what it was he\u2019d asked for. As the thought entered my head I took a quick look around and tried to see if anything particular stood out to me. Something was growing on the sofa that looked strangely human-shaped. It might have been just my imagination, but in the dark it seemed to turn towards me. Meanwhile the scientist continued to shiver in agony, his eyes focused on me and begging for help.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do,\u201d I said before slamming the door. Something about that strange pile on the sofa had deeply unsettled me.\n\nI put the word out, asked for a gun, but got a crossbow instead a few days later. A nervous looking sixteen year old boy ferried it to my door. I was surprised he\u2019d entered the building, but who knows who\u2019d ordered him to do so. I\u2019ve acquired a strange sort of respect amongst the locals and it comes in handy. This boy looked like he would have stamped on my head and robbed me blind any other day, but when he spoke to me he did so with more respect than I ever imagined I deserved. I thanked him, took the crossbow, spent an afternoon practicing with it, and then used it to kill the scientist the next morning.\n\nTook a few hits, but in the end one thumped into his forehead and shut down his whimpered moans. I didn\u2019t see anything on the sofa this time, at least not anything human-shaped, which I was thankful for. After that it was a simple case of calling the police and beginning a long chain of events that ended with half-a-dozen men in hazmat suits spraying the room with noxious chemicals. For a while there I\u2019d been worried that they\u2019d find a corpse and ask questions, but by the time anyone actually entered the room there was nothing left of the scientist save a splotch on the floor.\n\nI never did figure out exactly what it was he was after, although it is not uncommon for my morning sweep to turn up a body (or part of) covered in fungal growths. And I have been known to occasionally catch glimpses of a strange person lowering themselves into the floodwater of the elevator shaft. Of course I might just be making connections that aren\u2019t really there. All sorts of things live in that water. The entire level is flooded and if something was down there, it\u2019d have free reign over quite a large space.\n\nIt's a strange world down there. I should know on account of one visitor who gave me a very bad time. I\u2019ll call him the fisherman since he came to Annedale because of the flooded basement. Saw a photo that\u2019s been circulating around for a while now, if you know where to look. God knows who took it and how, but it shows the flooded stairwell leading to the basement and beneath the brackish surface is a hand that\u2019s all out of proportion. Fingers splayed with perfect symmetry like a starfish, it is reaching up out of the depths and resting gently on the third step below the water.\n\nWhen I first met him he was sitting happily with his feet over the edge of the flooded shaft, water up to his knees, with a rod and line set up beside him. It was quite a surprise at first, seeing him there with a little fly-fishing hat. A chubby but healthy looking man in his forties with an egg mayo sandwich in one hand and a phone playing candy crush in the other. I called out to him as I approached because, in my experience, startling someone in Annedale is bad for your health no matter how sane the visitor appears.\n\nHe looked up when I caught his attention and smiled amiably.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d he waved with his sandwich. \u201cYou\u2019re the caretaker?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes I am,\u201d I answered. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust a tourist,\u201d he smiled. \u201cCare to join me?\u201d\n\nThe sun had risen only moments ago.\n\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t here when it was dark, were you?\u201d I asked more than a little suspicious.\n\n\u201cOh no you\u2019ve only just caught me, been here barely ten minutes before you showed up. I was told you\u2019d be willing to help in exchange for a small fee.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat sort of help?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cOh just give me a nudge if any of the lines start moving,\u201d he said while pointing to a rod he\u2019d set up beside the basement stairs. The door was propped open and the line led down into the darkness below, water gently lapping just out of sight. Another line had been set up in a corner of the lobby where the floor had been torn away revealing a hole straight down into the basement. \u201cI can\u2019t keep an eye on them all at once, you see. I have bells ready but, well, two heads are better than one.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it exactly you\u2019re hoping to catch down there?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cAre you familiar with the primordial ocean?\u201d he said. \u201cThe abyssal waters that God split into light and dark, all that? It\u2019s not a physical location, per se, but it does connect to certain bodies of water depending on the time and place. Last recorded manifestation was in a glass of old whiskey underneath a forgotten bar in Mexico City. Some poor fellow knocked it over and didn\u2019t notice until the following day when half the bar was suddenly underwater. Quickly rectified but some of the things swimming in that water were something else, and all from at the bottom of a glass no wider than my wrist. Imagine what we can do with this!?\u201d he said while gesturing at water by his feet.\n\n\u201cYou think there could be fish alive down there?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cAt least,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019d be willing to pay for any reliable information, of course. Do you have any idea what might be down there?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot really,\u201d I shrugged. \u201cBut I\u2019d guess it wants to be left alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmmm you might be right there,\u201d he said while looking at his other rods. \u201cI didn\u2019t exactly put down any old lure, you know?\u201d\n\nHe reached into his pocket and took out a strange tuft of fur and ivory, holding it up for me to squint at.\n\n\u201cA tooth from a man who drowned in the sea. A drone collected it off a shipwreck near the Norwegian coast. The fur is actually red algae that was found growing on his bones. I have plenty of these and, well, other things that might appeal to what\u2019s on the other side. My research was thorough and expensive. Come on, take a seat. Flat fee, one thousand, just sit here until the sun starts to set.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just have to sit?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cAnd let me know if you hear or see anything.\u201d\n\nI groaned and sat beside him, folding my legs instead of letting them dangle in the water below. Despite my reticence, we stayed like that for several hours. He\u2019d brought lots of food, good homemade stuff, along with plenty of cold beer. We sat there and spoke very little, but we did eat and drink a tremendous amount. Not the kind of thing I do normally, but I was being paid to be there, and I didn\u2019t really have anywhere else to be. It was, all in told, a very pleasant afternoon.\n\nUntil I fell asleep.\n\nWhen I awoke it was with a terrible gasp. My chest was tight like something had been sitting on it, and judging from the terrible giggling and scampering feet I heard running off into the darkness, it might not have been *just* a feeling. Already panic was setting in as my eyes darted to the open doors and saw that the moon was out and had been for hours. I fumbled for my torch and turning it on saw that there was no sign of the fisherman. All his stuff had been left behind yet all that remained of him was his hat that still floated on the water. Even as I watched, a smooth glistening shape curled beneath the water and plucked it off the surface.\n\nI recoiled and crawled away from it as fast as I could. This was bad, I knew deep in my heart I\u2019d never been as at risk I was in that moment. The open doors that led outside were tempting, but just beside them were the stairs that led downwards and I swore I could hear something approaching. I couldn\u2019t help but picture the fungal man I\u2019d seen in the scientist\u2019s flat. Then again, that basement was huge and who knows what lay down there.\n\nI decided to go for the stairs. The entire time my heart was in my chest. I had never been caught outside my room at night, not since my first night when I\u2019d slept in the lobby with my coat pulled over me. You don\u2019t get lucky twice, not with Annedale, so I knew had to be careful. I had to be quiet. My only hope was to go unnoticed. I took to stealth, climbing each floor in perfect silence, hiding in well known spots at the slightest hint of footsteps, human or otherwise.\n\nAnnedale comes alive at night. Whispered mutterings from strange children who descend from air vents, living there for God knows how long. Other times I saw apparitions including one, a toddler, the sight of whom made my stomach growl with an insatiable hunger that hurt just to contemplate. She stared at me with pleading eyes as I slunk away from her open door. I might have been tempted to help her were it not for the sight of the moon peering through her translucent image.\n\nAnd yet, despite all this, I somehow made it to the fourteenth floor alive. Only it was there right at the final hurdle, so close to safety, that I came across something out of my worst nightmare.\n\nA woman stood outside my apartment door. Silent. Pale. Dirt covered fingernails. It was all too often I\u2019d open my door and find muddy impressions on the floor made by a woman\u2019s bare feet. Now I knew who left them every night. I couldn\u2019t see her face from where I hid, but something about her seemed profoundly familiar.\n\nWhen she finally turned towards me I remembered. I recognised her, even though most of her face was missing. It was the philosopher\u2019s wife. He had succeeded, it seemed. But I couldn\u2019t imagine at what God awful price, because the woman who stared at me had clearly weathered some years in the grave. It was only the poor lighting and her long hair that had covered up just how bad a state she was in. A lipless grin stared back at me below sunken cheekbones and hollow eye sockets. And yet, I could tell that in another life she had been beautiful which only made the sight all the more gut-wrenching.\n\n\u201cMy darling,\u201d she whispered, and there was something about her voice that I found hard to stay sane in the face of. I don\u2019t know why. Over a decade in that place and I\u2019d borne witness to living nightmares, but it was *this* walking corpse that pushed me to my limits. The inescapable feeling of loss weighed me down and without realising it I found myself taking steps towards her even as my knees buckled. By the time I reached her I was crawling until I could clutch her grimy icy leg, and that was the last thing I remember before I woke up in my bed the following morning.\n\nEverything seemed normal, so completely mundane that I could\u2019ve written the whole thing off as a bad nightmare. But there were footprints leading from my bed to the door. And later on I found the fisherman\u2019s things much as he left them, although when I finally reeled his lines in I found the lures gone and replaced with bits and pieces of the man who\u2019d first set them up. I threw it all into the water below and decided it would be best to forget him.\n\nEvery now and again, of course, I can\u2019t help but check my peephole at night. I never did before that, but now I do. I see her every single time. She looks sad. Hurts me to think of her out there. It ought to be terrifying but it\u2019s more like someone\u2019s ripped out my stomach and heart and let all my insides fall out the bottom.\n\nEach time I see her I wonder what exactly was it he did to bring her back?\n\nHe leaves only one hint. A final letter, I think. It\u2019s not like he dated them. In it he says he would give everything to have her in his arms once more. Not only his life, but everything he\u2019s already lived. Every sunset. Every good dream. Every nightmare. Every victory. Every loss. Every little memory that makes him who he is, he\u2019d give it all just to save her.\n\nSometimes I wonder about him, figuring we\u2019d probably be about the same age. I\u2019d like to think back and imagine what it would have been like for the two of us to meet as young men, but for some reason whenever I try to remember what my life was like before I came to this city, before I woke up with that coat pulled over me\u2026 well, I don\u2019t know\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s just hard, that\u2019s all.\n\nIt's almost like there's nothing there. Like something reached in and took all the years away. I guess it's just one of those things I'm better off not dwelling on."},"257":{"title":"I'm a Search and Rescue Officer for the US Forest Service, I have some stories to tell (Part 2!)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3ijnt6\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/","flair":"Series","author":"searchandrescuewoods","selftext":"First post: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3iex1h\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/\n\nSo I logged back on tonight and was blown away by the staggering amount of interest this seems to have generated. First off, I'll address a few things that you guys have brought up:\n\n* There's been an overwhelming amount of people mentioning the similarity between some of my stories and those of David Paulides. I assure you I'm not trying to rip him off in any way, I've got nothing but respect for the guy. He's actually what inspired me to write this, because I can verify a lot of the things he talks about. We do have a lot of these strange missing persons cases, and most of the time they aren't solved. Either that, or we find them in places they have no business being. I personally haven't been on many calls like that, but I'll share a few that I've seen, and a story my friend told me that relates to this.\n\n* There was a lot of feedback about the stairs, so I'll touch on that briefly here, and I'll also include a story. \nThey come in a variety of shapes, sizes, styles, and conditions. Some are pretty dilapidated, just ruins, but others are brand new. I saw one set that looked like they came from a lighthouse: they were metal and spiral, almost old-fashioned. \nThe stairs don't go up infinitely, or farther than I can see, but some sets are taller than others. Like I said before, just imagine the stairs in your house, as if someone cut-and-pasted them in the middle of nowhere. I don't have any pictures, it's never really occurred to me to try again after the first time, and I don't really feel like risking my job over it. I'll try again in the future, but I can't really promise anything.\n\n* A few people expressed confusion about the guy who ran into the man with no face. Just to clarify, when the climber ascended and reached the top of this peak, he saw another man in a parka and ski pants. This was the man with no face. Sorry about the confusing wording of that story, I'll try to avoid that in the future.\n\nAlright, on to the new stories:\n\n* As far as missing persons go, I'd say about half the calls I get are related to that. The others are rescue calls; people who fall down cliffs and hurt themselves, get injured by fire (you wouldn't believe how often this happens, mostly drunk kids), get bitten or stung by animals or insects. We're a tight team, and we have veterans who are excellent at finding signs of lost people. That's what makes these cases where we never find any trace of them so frustrating. One in particular was upsetting for all of us, because we *did* find a trace of them, but it just led to more questions than answers.\nAn older man had been hiking alone on a well-established trail, but his wife called to say that he hadn't come home when he should have. Apparently he had a history of seizures, and she was worried that he hadn't taken his medication and had suffered one out on the trail. Before you ask, I have no idea why he thought it was okay to go out alone, or why she didn't go with him. I don't ask about that kind of thing because past a certain point, it really doesn't matter. Someone is missing, and it's my job to find them. We went out in a standard search formation, and it wasn't long before one of our vets found signs that the guy had gone off the trail. We grouped up and followed him, spreading out in a fan to make sure we were covering as much ground as possible. Suddenly, a call comes over the radio telling us to all head back to the vets location, and we come right away, because this usually means the missing person is injured, and we need a full team to help get them out safely. \nWe meet back up, and the vet is just standing at the base of a tree with his hands on the sides of his head. I ask my buddy what's going on, and he points up into the branches of this tree. I almost couldn't believe what I was seeing, but there's a walking stick dangling from a branch at least thirty feet off the ground. The little strap thing on the handle has been looped around the branch, and it's just hanging there. There's no way the guy could have tossed it up that far, and we don't see any other signs that he's still in the area. We call up into the tree, but it's obvious no one's in it. We're all just sort of left scratching our heads. We keep searching for the guy, but we never find him. We even bring our canines out, but they lose his scent long before this tree. Eventually, the search is called off, because there are other calls we have to attend to, and past a certain point there's not much we can do. The guy's wife called us every day for *months*, asking if we'd found her husband, and it was heartbreaking to hear her get more and more hopeless each time.\nI'm not sure why this call in particular was so upsetting, but I think it was just the sheer improbability of it. That and the questions that were raised. How the hell had this guy's cane ended up there? Did someone kill him and toss that up there as some weird trophy? We did our best to find him, but it was almost like a taunt. We still talk about that one from time to time.\n\n* Missing kids are the most heart-breaking. Doesn't matter what circumstances they go missing under, it's never easy, and we always, *always* dread the ones we find deceased. It's not common, but it does happen. David Paulides talks a lot about kids SAR teams find in places they shouldn't be, or couldn't be. I can honestly say I've heard about this kind of thing happening more than I've seen it, but I'll share one of the ones that I think about a lot that I witnessed personally.\nA mother and her three kids were out for a picnic in an area of the park that has a small lake. One is six, one is five, and the other is about three. She's watching them all really closely, and according to her, she never lets them out of her sight at any time. She never saw anyone else in the area either, which is important.\nShe packs their stuff up and they start to head back to the parking area. Now, this lake is only about two miles into the woods, and it's on a *very* clearly established trail. It's almost impossible to get lost getting from the parking area to it, unless you're deliberately going off the path like an imbecile. Her kids are walking in front of her, when she hears what sounds like someone coming up the path behind her. She turns around, and in the four or so seconds she's not looking, her five-year-old son vanishes. She figures he's stepped off the trail to pee or something, and she asks her other two where he went. They both tell her that 'a big man with a scary face' came out of the woods next to them, took the kid's hand, and led him into the trees. The two remaining kids don't seem upset, in fact she says later that it seems like they've been drugged. They're sort of spacey and fuzzy. So of course, she freaks out, starts looking frantically in the area for her kid. She's screaming his name, and she says at one point she thinks she heard him answer her. Now obviously she can't go blindly running into the woods, she's got the other two kids, so she calls the police and they send us out immediately. We respond, and we start the search for him.Over the course of this search, which spans *miles*, we never find a single trace of the kid. Canines can't pick up any scent, we don't find any clothing or broken bushes or literally anything that would signify a child being there. Of course there's suspicion about the mother for a while, but it's pretty clear that she's completely destroyed by the whole thing. We looked for this kid for weeks, with a lot of volunteer help.  But eventually, the search peters out, and we have to move on. \nThe volunteers keep searching, though, and one day we get a call on the radio letting us know that a body has been found and needs to be recovered. They tell us the location, and none of us can believe it. We figure it has to be a different kid. But we go out there, about 15 miles from the site where he vanished, and sure enough, we find the body of the kid we've been looking for. \nI have been trying to figure out how this kid got where he did ever since we found him, and I've never come up with an answer. A volunteer just happened to be in the area, because he figured he might as well look in places no one else would think to on the off chance the body had been dumped. He comes to the base of a tall, rocky slope, and half-way up, he sees something. He looks through his binoculars and sure enough, it's the body of a little boy, stuffed in a little opening in the rock. He recognizes the color of the kid's shirt, so he knows right away that it's the missing boy. That's when he calls it in, and we're dispatched.\nIt took us almost an hour to get his body down, and none of us could believe what we were seeing. Not only was this kid 15 miles from where he'd started, there was no possible way he could have gotten up there on his own. This slope is treacherous, and it's hard even for us with our climbing gear. A five-year-old boy had no way of getting up there, of that I'm certain.\nNot only that, but the kid doesn't have a scratch on him. His shoes are gone, but his feet aren't damaged or dirty. So it wasn't as if an animal dragged him up there. And from what we can tell, he hasn't been dead that long. He'd been out there over a month by that point, and it looked like he'd only been dead for, at most, a day or two. The whole thing was unbelievably strange, and was one of the most disconcerting calls I've ever been on. \nWe found out later that the coroner determined the kid had died from exposure. He'd frozen to death, probably late at night two days before we found him. There were no suspects, and no answers. To date, it's one of the weirdest things I've ever seen.\n\n* One of my first jobs as a trainee was a search op for a four-year-old kid that had gotten separated from his mom. This was one of those cases where we knew we were gonna find him because the dogs were on a strong scent trail, and we saw clear signs that he was in the area. We ended up finding him in a berry patch about half a mile from where he'd been last seen. Kid wasn't even aware that he'd wandered that far. One of the vets brought him back, which I was glad for because I'm really not good with kids, and I find it hard to talk to them and keep them company. \nAs my trainer and I are headed back, she decides to take me on a detour to show me one of the hot spots where we tend to find missing people. It's a natural dip in the land near a popular trail, and people will usually move downhill because it's easier. We hike out there, it's a few miles away, and we get there in about an hour or so. As we're walking around the area and she's pointing out places she's found people in the past, I see something in the distance. Now, this area we're in is about eight miles from the main parking area, though there's back roads you can take to get closer if you don't want to hike that far. But we're on state-protected land, which means there can't be any kind of commercial or residential development out here. The most you'll ever see is a fire tower or makeshift shelter that homeless people think they can get away with building. But I can see from here that whatever this thing is has straight edges, and if there's one thing you learn quickly, it's that nature rarely makes straight lines. I point it out, but she doesn't say anything. She just hangs back and lets me wander over and check it out. I get within about twenty feet of it, and all the hair on the back of my neck stands up.\nIt's a staircase. In the middle of the fucking woods. In the proper context, it would literally be the most benign thing ever. It's just a normal staircase, with beige carpet, and about ten steps tall. But instead of being in a house, where it obviously should be, it's out here in the middle of the woods. The sides aren't carpeted, obviously, and I can see the wood it's made of. It's almost like a video game glitch, where the house has failed to load completely and the stairs are the only thing visible. \nI stand there, and it's like my brain is working overtime to try and make sense of what I'm seeing. My trainer comes and stands next to me, and she just stands there casually, looking at it as if it's the least interesting thing in the world. I ask her what the fuck this thing is doing here, and she just chuckles.\n'Get used to it, rookie. You're gonna see a lot of them.' I start to move closer, but she grabs my arm. Hard.\n'I wouldn't do that.' She says. Her voice is casual, but her grip is tight, and I just stand there looking at her. 'You're gonna see them all the time, but don't go near them. Don't touch them, don't go up them. Just ignore them.' I start to ask her about it, but something in the way she's looking at me tells me that it's best if I don't. We end up moving on, and the subject doesn't come up again for the rest of my training.\nShe was right, though. I'd say about every fifth call I go on, I end up running across a set of stairs. Sometimes they're relatively close to the path, maybe within two or three miles. Sometimes they're twenty, thirty miles out, literally in the middle of nowhere, and I only find them during the broadest searches or training weekends. They're usually in good condition, but sometimes it looks like they've been out there for miles. All different kinds, all different sizes. The biggest I ever saw looked like they came out of a turn-of-the-century mansion, and were at least ten feet wide, with steps leading up at least fifteen or twenty feet.\nI've tried talking about it with people, but they just give me the same response my trainer did. 'It's normal. Don't worry about it, they're not a big deal, but don't go close to them or up them.' When trainees ask me about it now, I give them the same response. I don't really know what else to tell them. I'm really hoping someday I get a better answer, but it hasn't happened yet.\n\n* This is another one that was less spooky and more sad. A young man went missing late in winter, when realistically no one should be going that far out onto the trails. We close a lot of them, but some remain open year round, unless there's a shit-load of snow. We did an op for him, but we had about six feet of snow on the ground (it was an unusually heavy snow year), and we knew it wasn't likely that we'd find him until spring when the thaw came. Sure enough, when the first big thaw came, a hiker reported a body a little ways off the main trail. We found him at the base of a tree, in a pile of melted snow. I knew right away what had happened, and it scared the living shit out of me. Most of you who ski or snowboard, or spend any amount of time on a mountain, will probably have guessed too. When snow falls, it doesn't collect as thick in the areas beneath the branches. It happens most with fir trees, because they have a sort of closed umbrella shape. So what you end up with is a space around the base of a tree that's filled with a mixture of loose, powdery snow, air, and branches. They're called tree wells, and they're not immediately obvious if you don't know what you're looking for. We put up signs in the welcome center, big ones, letting people know how dangerous they are, but every year that we get an unusual amount of snow, at least one person doesn't read them, or doesn't take the warning seriously, and we find out about it in spring. \nMy best guess is that this young man was hiking and got tired, or maybe a cramp from walking in the deep snow. He went to go sit at the base of the tree, not knowing that there was a tree well, and fell in. He got stuck with his feet up, and the surrounding snow caved in around him. Unable to free himself, he suffocated. It's called snow immersion suffocation, and it doesn't usually happen except in really deep snow. But if you get stuck in a weird position, like this guy did, even six feet of snow can be lethal.\nWhat scared me the most was imagining how he must have struggled. Upside down, in the freezing cold, he didn't die quickly. The snow would have formed a dense, heavy pile on top of him, and it would have been literally impossible to get out. As it got harder to breathe, he would have known what was happening. I can't even imagine what he was thinking in his last moments.\n\n* A lot of my less outdoorsy friends want to know if I've ever seen the Goatman while I've been out on calls. Unfortunately, or I guess fortunately, I've never had anything quite like that happen. I guess the closest was the whole 'black-eyed man' thing, but I didn't see anything. However, there was one call where I had something kind of similar happen, but I'm not sure I'm willing to chalk it up to the Goatman.\nWe'd gotten a report that an older woman had fainted along one of the trails, and needed assistance getting back down to the main area.\nWe hike up to where she's at, and her husband is just beside himself. He runs, well, I guess more jogs, to us, and tells us that he was a little ways off the trail looking at something when his wife starts screaming behind him. He runs back to her and she's passed out on the trail. We get her on a backboard, and as we're getting her down to the welcome center, she comes to and starts screaming again. I calm her down and ask her what happened. I can't remember verbatim what she said, but essentially, what happened was this:\nShe'd been waiting for her husband when she started hearing this really strange sound. She said it sounded sort of like a cat, but it was off somehow, and she couldn't quite figure out why. She went a little ahead to try and hear it better, and it sounded like it was coming closer. She said the closer it got, the more uneasy she was, until she finally figured out what was wrong. I do remember this next part, because it was so weird that I don't think I could forget it if I tried.\n\"It wasn't a cat. It was a man, saying the word 'meow' over and over. Just 'meow, meow, meow'. But it wasn't a man, it couldn't have been, because I've never heard a man make his voice buzz like that. I thought my hearing aid was going out, but it wasn't, I adjusted it and it still sounded all buzzy. It was awful. He was coming closer, but I couldn't see him. And the closer he got the more scared I was, and the last thing I remember was a shape coming out of the trees. I guess that's when I fainted.\" \nNow, obviously I'm a little perplexed as to why a guy would be out in the fucking woods chanting 'meow, meow' at people. So once we get down the mountain, I tell my superior that I'm gonna go search the area to see if I can find anything. He gives me the go ahead, and I grab a radio and hike back to where she fainted. I don't see anyone, so I keep going about a mile more, and I when I head back I go off the trail, to see if I can figure out where she saw him coming from. It's almost sunset by this point, and I don't have any desire to be out at night alone, so I just sort of write it off and make a mental note to check it out again tomorrow. But as I'm headed back, I start to hear something in the distance. I stop, and I call out for anyone in the immediate area to identify themselves. The sound didn't come closer or get louder, but it sounded exactly like a man saying 'meow, meow' in this really odd monotone. As comical as it makes it sound, it was almost like that guy on South Park with the electrolarynx, Ned. I go off the trail in the direction I think it's coming from, but I never seem to get closer. It's almost like it's coming from all directions. Eventually, it just sort of fades out, and I ended up going back to the welcome center. \nI didn't get any further reports like that, and even though I went back to that area, I never heard that exact sound again. I suppose it could have been some stupid kid out there fucking with people, but even I have to admit it was weird. \n\nSo this kind of turned into a massive wall of text, and for that I apologize. I wanted to get to the stories my friend told me, and he does have some good ones, so I'll post those tomorrow evening. I also have a few more of my own I think you guys will like. I'm sorry to keep you all in suspense again, hopefully the stories here make up for it and help you get through the next 24 hours until I can post again!\n\nEDIT: Since it seems like all of you would like to hear more, tomorrow I'll write up as many stories as I can and do a massive post. I'll include my friend's stories, and I'll see if I can't get ahold of a few more people who might have interesting things to talk about. I just wasn't sure how people felt about big huge walls of text, but if you're all okay with it, I'll post lots of stories!\n\n**EDIT: Part 3 is up: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3iocju\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/**"},"258":{"title":"The Grim Reaper's scythe isn't to harvest you.

No monstrous visage discovered yet has been as terrifying as the infinite potential for horror which exists before the mask is removed. \n\nThat is why we humans, in our naive misunderstanding of the universal order, are gripped by the mortal fear of death. We think it the final frontier - the greatest imaginable unknown from whose penumbral shores no traveler may return. And so we cling desperately onto even the most dreary and anguished lives, suffering any known evil over our release into the beyond. \n\nBut death is not to be feared, because death is very well understood. We have witnessed it, caused it, measured and recorded it to the last dying spasm of neuronal flickering. Even as I lay dying, it seemed silly to me that I should be afraid of the emptiness which reason promised to expect. \n\nWhile I was alive I wouldn't experience death, so there was no reason to be afraid now. When I was dead, I wouldn't be capable of experiencing anything, so fear still had no cause. That thought brought me great comfort as I felt the last erratic struggle from my heart against the inevitable conclusion I approached. It wasn't until I was finally drifting off to sleep that a final intrusive doubt bubbled in my brain:\n\n*What if it isn't death which is to be feared? What if it is what lies beyond?*\n\nAnd so troubled did I slip beyond mortal understanding, stepping into a world as far forsaken by reason as I was now from life. I was still in the hospital room, but the bustle of nurses and the beeping machines lost their opacity as though I was mired in swiftly descending dusk. It seemed as though every sound was an echo of what it once was; every sight a reflection. With each passing moment, the world was becoming less real...\n\nBut all that sight and sound - all that being - it wasn't simply disappearing. It was *transforming* into a figure beside me. The less real my room became, the more real the figure was, until presently it existed in such sharp actuality that nothing beside it seemed real at all. \n\nHis cloak was black. Not the *color* black, but its essence. It was as though seeing a tiger after a lifetime of looking at a child's crude drawing and thinking that's all a tiger was. Reality flowed around his scythe like a brush through water colors, and I could see each elementary particle and time itself sunder across its blade. \n\nSurely this, I thought. This is why we were taught without words to fear death. I clutched at my hospital blanket to cower from the intensity of the Reaper's presence, but the once soft cotton now flowed like translucent mist through my hands. I knew in that moment that nothing could hide me from the specter's grasp, for he was the only real thing in this world. \n\n**You're late.**\n\nThey weren't words. My head ached from the strain of this knowledge as my lateness was burned into my awareness, imparted like an inescapable law of physics as unequivocal as gravity. \n\n**We don't have time for the usual speech. Hurry now.**\n\nI felt myself swept up around him like dirt in a hurricane. Before I knew what was happening, we were outside the hospital, moving at such a frenzied pace that the world around me blurred into a dizzying tunnel of flashing light. \n\n**If you're lucky, IT will have gotten bored of waiting for you.**\n\nI had too many questions, all fighting for attention in the forefront of my brain without any making their way out. \n\n**You're quiet. I admire that. Usually people ask too much.**\n\n\"What's the point?\" I asked. My voice felt flat and dead compared to his overwhelming substance. \"How can I try to comprehend something so beyond mortal knowledge?\"\n\n**You can't. But it's still human nature to ask.**\n\nWe weren't slowing. If anything, our pace was increasing. I wasn't running, or flying, or anything of that nature. It was more like the rest of the world was moving around us while we stood still. A vague darkness and a heavy damp smell made me guess that we'd gone underground, but I couldn't say for sure. \n\n\"One question then,\" I asked. \"What else is here besides you?\" \n\n**And that is why questions are pointless. Death is not a place, or a person. It's all there is.**\n\nTroubling thought, but made more so by the growing howl which began reverberating the rocks around me. We still seemed to be descending into the Earth, and the air was growing warmer and denser now. The sound continued to mount as though the world itself was suffering. \n\n\"Then what is IT?\"\n\n**What I'm here to protect you from.**\n\nThe rocks split from a flash of his scythe, and the ground opened further into a sprawling cavern dominated by a subterranean lake. \n\n\"But I thought you said you were all there is.\"\n\n**No, I said Death was all there is.**\n\nWe weren't moving any longer. Light glinted off the scythe from some unseen source and streamed into the lake like a tributary. Once inside, the light didn't reflect or dissipate, but swirled and danced like luminescent oil. \n\n\"I thought you were Death.\"\n\n**Death is not a person.**\n\nThe light was taking a life of its own inside the water. The still surface began to churn with the enigmatic energy. It took my scattered mind a long while to realize that *I* was the energy flowing into the lake. I still felt tangled up with the figure, but we now existed as a beam of light boiling into the water. \n\nI knew I wouldn't understand, but that didn't stop me from feeling frustrated. If Death is all there is, then what is IT? What was waiting for me? The water pressed in around me and I couldn't speak, although I could still draw breath somehow. \n\n**IT is here.**\n\nSomething was in the water around me. Hands grabbed me by the legs and began dragging me downward. I was amazed to even discover I had limbs again. They felt so alien to me that it was almost as though this body was not my own. Light flashed from the scythe - then again. The hands let go, and the howling rose once more. The Reaper was fighting something, although I couldn't make any sense of the battle except for the madness of thrashing water.\n\nThe howling Earth reached its crescendo, and the *screams* made the water around me convulse and contract like living fluid. Had the Reaper cut it? Was I safe? I began to explore my new body in the water, but just when I thought I was beginning to gain control the hands clutched me once more. I lurched downward, struggling in vain against their implacable grip. \n\n\"What is here?\" I tried to shout against the suffocating liquid. \"What is happening?\" \n\nBut I couldn't sense the Reaper's presence any longer. The heat was unbearable, but the cold depths the hands were dragging me toward was even worse. I became aware of a blinding light at the bottom of the lake, and though I struggled, the hands dragged me inexorably onward. \n\n**I'm sorry. I couldn't fight IT off.** It seemed to be coming from so far away now. **We will try again next time.** \n\nThe pressure - the heat - the noise - the hands dragging me into the blinding light. I closed my eyes and screamed. I was free from the water now, but I just kept screaming. I couldn't bear to look at IT - whatever had stolen me. Whatever was Death but wasn't - whatever even the Reaper could not defeat. \n\nThen words spoke. Real, human words from a real human mouth. My senses were so distraught that I couldn't make sense of them, but I'm guessing they were something like: \n\n\"Congratulations! He's a healthy baby boy.\" \n\nMost people can't remember the day they die, or the day they were born. I happen to remember both, and I know that [they are the same](http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sirtobiaswade).

My twin sister, Chel, begged me to rush with her the summer before our freshman year approached, but I think she knew deep-down I was a lost cause. I was a band geek in high school, and a band geek I intended to remain.\n\nDon't get me wrong - this isn't some \"not like other girls\" bullshit. I was happy for Chel. I even got trashed on celebratory wine coolers with her when she pledged her sorority. We just had different interests. As long as she was happy, that\u2019s all that mattered, and I know she felt the same about me.\n\nHow did I miss that she was so deeply unhappy?\n\nShe threw herself off the bell tower in the center of campus less than 3 weeks before the end of the spring semester. I hadn\u2019t seen her in a couple of days; I was holed up at the library pulling double all-nighters to finish my final paper for Greek and Roman Mythology. I woke up in the early afternoon on a Sunday to 10 missed calls from mom and a text from Chel. \n\n*love u forever Lou. i\u2019m so sorry.*\n\n2:55 a.m. Witnesses say she jumped at 3:02.\n\nI skipped finals, took incompletes in all of my classes, and headed home to be with my mom. Alex, our best friend from high school, offered to bail on the rest of the semester too, but I didn\u2019t want him to lose his scholarship. Still, he made the 2-hour drive home every weekend to hang with me. We didn't talk much; it still hurt too much to remember the good times, and I didn't care much about the present. But it was better than drinking alone, and Alex was generous with sharing his weed.\n\nMy mom insisted I get back into the swing of things this Fall. I decided just to do a half-time course load, mostly focused on finishing up my classes from last semester. I moved into a solo room in the dorms that\u2019s more the size of a closet than a real livable space. I didn\u2019t mind being alone. I kind of preferred it that way.\n\nAlex, though, thought that the solitude was bad for me. Or at least that\u2019s what he claimed when he dragged me along to a Greek party last weekend. Chel was popular among the guys in his fraternity, he said, and they\u2019d all been asking about me. Worried. I really didn\u2019t want to go, but Alex wouldn\u2019t let up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what Michelle would want, Louise.\u201d \n\nAsshole. Even if he was right.\n\nThat\u2019s how I found myself last Saturday in the passenger seat of Alex\u2019s BMW, driving out in the middle of bumfuck nowhere. I quickly realized I had no idea where the hell we were or where we were headed. I\u2019d never gone to a frat party with Chel - navigating a sea of sweaty dudes who smell like PBR isn\u2019t my ideal night out - but I was pretty sure most frat houses weren\u2019t 45 minutes from campus, tucked away off a dirt road that didn\u2019t even have a name on Google Maps.\n\nI picked at a fraying thread on the hem of my sweater, one of Chel\u2019s. It was bright green and haphazardly cropped at the waist in a homemade chop job. It wasn\u2019t my style at all, and I never would have worn it before Chel...before she was gone. But that night, wearing it gave me confidence, like she was there with me.\n\n\u201cSo....what\u2019s the deal with this party anyway? Or are you driving me out to the middle of nowhere to murder me?\u201d \n\nAlex rolled his eyes and fished a piece of black cardstock out of the mess of napkins on his center console. The paper was heavy, expensive, with gold-embossed letters glittering in a scrolling font:\n\n*You Are Cordially Invited*  \n*The Sisters of House Omega welcome you to our Fall semester Culling.*  \n*Attendance is mandatory.*  \n*Only the true of heart will remain until dawn.*  \n*Will that be you, Alex?*\n\n\u201cDid all the guys in the house get one of these?\u201d I turned the paper over, where an address and time was listed. County Road 5. Midnight.\n\n\u201cYeah, \u2018bout a week ago? We\u2019re still trying to figure out who\u2019s hosting.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not this Omega sorority?\u201d\n\nAlex laughed at me, not unkindly. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing, Louise.\u201d\n\nI frowned. A party in the middle of nowhere, hosted by nobody? I was already starting to regret abandoning my resolve to live the semester as a hermit.\n\n\u201cNone of this is creeping you out? What does it mean by \u2018Culling,\u2019 anyway?\u201d \n\n\u201cAh, it\u2019s just for dramatics. See who can stick it out all night, ya know? Maybe there\u2019ll be a prize. And you know what?\u201d He grinned and slapped me on the thigh. I slapped him back. \u201cWe\u2019re not gonna pussy out. We\u2019ll be the winners, last ones standing, just like old times. You with me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI turn into a pumpkin after 2.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m serious, Lou.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo am I, *Alexander.*\u201d He knew I hated being called Lou. Chel always called me Lou. \u201cBesides, are they even going to let me in? I didn\u2019t get one of these.\u201d I shook the invitation in his face. \n\nI was starting to have a really bad feeling. If I\u2019d known about all this weirdness beforehand, I would\u2019ve already been in bed. Tossing and turning on my lumpy twin mattress, brainstorming ways to beg Professor Dickson for yet another extension on my first paper, sounded better than stumbling into the plot of *Texas Chainsaw Massacre*.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Louise, if it\u2019s lame, we\u2019ll bail. And they\u2019ll definitely let you in. I mean, you look just like her, they\u2019ll -\u201d\n\n\u201cFeel sorry for me?\u201d\n\nI took grim satisfaction seeing the smile slip off his face. \n\n\u201cNo, absolutely not.\u201d His lips pulled down into a frown and I looked away. \u201cLouise,\u201d his large hand grasped my fingers gently. His voice had gone soft.  \u201cI just mean that everybody loved Chel, and they\u2019ll love you too. Just like she did.\u201d \n\nI looked out the window and blinked hard once, twice, before clearing my throat. \n\n\u201cFine. But the *second* I\u2019m ready to leave, we\u2019re leaving, prize be damned.\u201d\n\nAlex squeezed my hand and let go. \u201cDeal.\u201d\n\nWe continued the drive in silence. Alex drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and I scanned the empty fields on the side of the road. We\u2019d pulled off on the county road over 10 minutes ago; we\u2019d almost missed the turn-off, which was only marked by a small, weathered wood sign, embossed with a gold Omega symbol. There was still no sign of a party.\n\n\u201cAlex\u2026\u201d\n\nAlex shifted in the driver\u2019s seat and hunched over the steering wheel, squinting into the darkness.\n\n\u201cYeah...it\u2019s uh...I feel like we should have seen it by now.\u201d\n\nHe laughed, high-pitched and thready. I continued unraveling the loose thread on the hem of Chel\u2019s sweater.\n\nThe BMW crested a large hill, and I let out a breath I hadn\u2019t known I was holding. A large, white farmhouse stood in the valley below us, a fleet of Land Rovers and Mercedes parked haphazardly in the grass out front.  Alex laughed - much more genuinely, this time - and patted my knee as he parked next to a Lexus.\n\n\u201cRelax, it\u2019s gonna be fun.\u201d\n\nI mustered up a smile but didn\u2019t say anything. Alex grinned and hopped out of the car. I peered up at the house. The facade was bright and cheery, freshly painted with bright blue shutters flanking the windows, the front door a bubbly yellow. The interior, glimpsed through the open blinds, looked warm and inviting, and I could already feel the bass beat of a shitty pop song vibrating softly in my chest. It all looked pretty innocuous. Maybe I could have a good time. For Alex. \n\n*For Chel.*\n\nThe loud clunk of the passenger door opening startled me. Alex arched his eyebrow, forearm braced on the roof of the car.\n\n\u201cAre you coming, or were you planning to wait in the car all night?\u201d\n\nI rolled my eyes and unbuckled. I socked him on the arm as I climbed out of the car.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s have some fun or whatever.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t need to worry about getting in the door. There was nobody checking invitations. We were greeted by a loud cheer of \u201cAlex!\u201d when we entered the living room, the party well underway.\n\nA few guys ran up, thumping Alex on the back and nodding my way in polite acknowledgement. I was suddenly enveloped in a bear hug by a man whose name I couldn\u2019t remember, overwhelmed by a cloud of Axe and sour beer-breath.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so glad you could make it, Lou. We miss Chel so much.\u201d\n\nA chorus of drunk voices chimed in, booming in the small space of the foyer.\n\n\u201cCHEL!\u201d\n\nSour-breath let me go to pump his fist in the air, and the boys all started chanting Chel\u2019s name. I couldn\u2019t decide whether I was endeared or disgusted. Alex flushed and elbowed one of his brothers in the ribs. I was about to give him shit when another, much more slender arm wrapped around my shoulders.\n\n\u201cOh, Louise! I didn\u2019t know you were going to be here.\u201d \n\nAnna, the president of Chel\u2019s sorority, had to crouch down to hug me. Her words were slurred, her movements languid and clumsy, but her big brown eyes were clear and focused when she pulled back. Anna had always liked Chel, took her under her wing when she first started pledging, and she\u2019d always made me feel welcome in the house. So it was out of the ordinary that she looked concerned, rather than pleased, to see me.\n\n\u201cUh...yeah. Alex said it would be cool?\u201d I glared in Alex\u2019s direction. He just shrugged.\n\nAnna\u2019s brow furrowed, but before she could answer, another voice chimed in, rich and melodic.\n\n\u201cOh? I didn\u2019t realize this was Alex\u2019s party.\u201d\n\nAnna froze, and her eyes widened. Slowly, she turned to face three of the most beautiful women I had ever seen in my entire life. Despite their striking appearance, I don\u2019t know that I could describe any of them now; it\u2019s all kind of fuzzy in my memory, but I do know that they were supermodel tall, willowy, with bright eyes that seemed to stare right through you. One of the women - sparkling green eyes boring into mine - spoke again in the same resonant tone.\n\n\u201cAnna? Who\u2019s your party-crasher friend?\u201d\n\nShe smiled when she said it, and her tone betrayed no ill will, but I still shrank back behind Anna instinctually. I looked around again for Alex, but he had wandered off already. That set off distant alarm bells in my head, after all his promises that we would stick together, but I couldn\u2019t focus on anything but the woman in front of me. Anna grabbed my hand and squeezed it tightly.\n\n\u201cOh, uh...this is, you remember Chel, the girl I told you about? This is her sister, Louise, and...well, I  think Alex just thought...\u201d\n\nAnother of the three women, grey eyes this time, stepped around Anna in one smooth motion, interrupting her rambling. She grabbed my hand out of Anna\u2019s and clasped it between both of her own. Her skin was cool, almost cold, but her grip was soft. I thought I was just rocking a stupid crush at the time, but the world seemed to tilt off center when she bent down to meet me at eye-level, voice whisper-soft yet strong enough to carry over the house music thumping through the floorboards.\n\n\u201cDarling, I\u2019m so sorry about your sister, but I\u2019m really not sure this party is your scene.\u201d\n\nAnna looked downright panicked by this point, falling all over herself to apologize to the trio. I scanned the crowd and, aside from Alex and a couple of his fraternity brothers, I only saw one other person at the party who looked familiar, a girl from Chel and Anna\u2019s sorority - Beth? Stacy? - who I knew almost nothing about. Chel had never introduced me to her. A distant part of me registered that I should be embarrassed, or, that if Anna was panicking, maybe I should be too. Instead, I felt a strange sense of calm, content to follow wherever that voice might lead me.\n\n\u201cOf course, I didn\u2019t mean to cause any trouble\u2026\u201d\n\nThe third woman stepped forward and rested a graceful hand lightly on my shoulder. Bright blue eyes danced kindly. I couldn\u2019t look away.\n\n\u201cNo trouble at all, sweetheart, just let me walk you to your car.\u201d\n\nAnna looked on helplessly as the two women guided me slowly to the door. A tiny splinter of logic somehow managed to pierce the haze that had settled over my brain.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a car. Alex drove me.\u201d\n\nGrey-eyes and blue-eyes looked at each other for a few minutes, seeming to have a silent conversation. Blue-eyes finally sighed and turned back to me. \n\n\u201cWell then, I guess there\u2019s nothing for it. Want to keep me company in the kitchen?\u201d\n\nI could feel the dopey grin splitting my face, but I couldn\u2019t do anything to stop it. I nodded a bit too enthusiastically to be cool. Blue-eyes laughed; it sounded like bells. My mind sunk deeper into the fog.\n\nIt didn\u2019t even cross my mind to go find Alex. I forgot about Anna\u2019s frantic worry from just moments before. I let blue-eyes take my hand and lead me further into the house. I felt safe while I was with her. A peace I hadn\u2019t felt since Chel\u2019s death washed over me.\n\nThe next day, as the memories came back to me in flashes, I would realize how... *off* everything was. The whole house had this shimmery glow about it, like something out of a dream.  Alex\u2019s fraternity brothers and the handful of girls from Chel\u2019s sorority drank from seemingly bottomless red Solo cups and danced feverishly in the living room, pressed tightly together in a writhing mass; the rest of the partygoers did shot after shot in the kitchen, a never ending supply of vodka and tequila flowing freely, poured generously by the mysterious Sisters of House Omega. The Sisters themselves, each as stunningly gorgeous as the last, stood around the party\u2019s periphery, laughing easily at the revelry without actually partaking in any of it themselves. All the while, those piercing eyes swept over the party with a calculated, unsettling intensity. \n\nHindsight, of course, is 20\/20. At the time, I was too swept up myself, too enraptured by ocean blue eyes, to notice anything odd.\n\nI wish I could remember her name. Blue-eyes. In spite of everything that happened, I still find myself yearning to know more about her. She pulled me into a cozy bench seat in the corner of the kitchen, away from the worst of the noise. She tucked a stray hair behind my ear with long, graceful fingers, and the whole world fell away. She asked me to tell her all about myself. So I did.\n\nI poured my heart out. I told her about what it was like coming out in high school in a small town in the Midwest, and how supportive Chel always was, even when Alex wigged out and didn\u2019t talk to me for a month. I told her about my dreams of becoming a songwriter and making a break for the coast, about how that dream died with Chel because I couldn\u2019t imagine anybody else singing my songs but her. I told her about all of my hopes and my desires, about my guilt at moving on to live a life that Chel and I had always planned to live together. I told her about my deepest fear: that I don\u2019t know who I am without my twin sister, my other half. That maybe without Chel, I\u2019m nothing at all. \n\nLooking back on it, I can\u2019t remember what blue-eyes actually said to me throughout all of this. She certainly didn\u2019t give away anything about herself, who she was, where she came from - not even her name. But I remember this overwhelming sense of comfort, of her telling me, maybe not in so many words, that I was *somebody*; I was important, I mattered. Even though she didn\u2019t - couldn\u2019t have - known me, somehow she *did*, and she loved me. She held me as I laughed and cried, and it felt like she was laughing and crying with me, feeling everything I felt just as deeply. \n\nThe next part gets even fuzzier. At some point, blue-eyes took my hand and invited me upstairs. Usually this is the part where I lose my cool, especially with a woman so gut-wrenchingly beautiful, but the nerves never came. I felt like I was floating all the way up the stairs, to her room, to the edge of her twin bed. When she finally kissed me and pressed me back into soft sheets, galaxies exploded behind my closed eyes.\n\nIt didn\u2019t go any farther than that, but it was somehow the most intimate experience of my life. I have no idea how long we stayed there, arms around each other, lips sliding together softly, sweetly. At some point, she pulled away to give me another of those deep, searching looks.. She opened her mouth as if to speak when, somewhere in the house, a clock started to chime midnight. \n\nHer head snapped toward the door. She ducked her head and sighed.\n\n\u201cWait here, Lou.\u201d\n\nI nodded; it wasn\u2019t a question. There was nowhere else I wanted to be. With one last press of her lips to mine, she was gone.\n\nI flopped back onto the bed, idly wondering how long she would be gone and what we might get up to when she got back. Before I could follow that train of thought too far, a high-pitched, harsh shriek rent the night, painfully loud even over the pounding baseline from downstairs. More inhuman, screeching voices soon joined in.\n\nI shot up in bed just as the dance music cut out with the painfully grating sound of feedback from the speakers. There was a series of terrible, thundering crashes, and a chorus of panicked screams sounded from the partygoers below.\n\nThe peaceful veil clouding my thoughts lifted in an instant. It finally caught up to me how *wrong* the situation was. I didn\u2019t even really remember coming upstairs, and I hadn\u2019t seen Alex in hours\u2026\n\n*Shit, Alex is down there.*\n\nI ran to the door, but it wouldn\u2019t budge. Distantly, I thought I could hear Alex screaming my name, scared and in pain, and I started slamming my body into the door, calling out for him until my voice was shredded. I looked around frantically for my phone, but it wasn\u2019t anywhere in the room. I couldn\u2019t remember where I had left it. Footsteps pounded down the hallway outside, a terrified scream coming closer, abruptly silenced when something slammed into the other side of the bedroom door with a wet, heavy thud. I stumbled back until my knees hit the edge of the bed. \n\nI sobbed and made a break for the windows instead. I was just about to take my chances jumping from the second story when a small TV in the corner of the room switched on, static buzzing at the highest volume. Half-wild, I thought briefly of chucking the whole TV through the windowpane before the blurred pixels started to resolve into a familiar face.\n\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d\n\nThere on the TV, impossibly, was Chel. My escape plan was quickly abandoned. I reached out to the screen with shaking fingers, as though I could reach through the cold glass and touch her face. \n\nThe scene on the TV started to play. I couldn\u2019t look away.\n\nChel was at a party in what I recognized as the basement of Alex\u2019s fraternity house. She was trashed, drink sloshing over the rim of her cup onto her sweater. The sweater I was wearing that night. Alex stepped into frame, laughing, and poured more liquor into her cup.\n\n\u201cEasy, Chel, you\u2019re going to lose the rest of your drink!\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t have that!\u201d whooped a frat brother in the background. Alex turned and shot him a glare.\n\n\u201cWhen are the other girls gonna get here?\u201d Chel\u2019s voice was slurred, mumbling. \u201cIs Lou still coming?\u201d\n\nA chorus of giggles sounded from the small handful of girls in the background. I recognized Beth\/Stacy as one of the onlookers. Alex looked back at the crowd and swallowed. He smiled wanly at Chel.\n\n\u201cYeah, Chel, she\u2019s on her way. Listen - how about we play a game while we wait for her?\u201d\n\nMy stomach felt like stone, bile clawing up the back of my throat. Distantly, I could still hear the rampage continuing in the house around me. Wails of pain and fear, shrieks of rage and triumph, and under it all, a thick, fleshy ripping sound. \n\n\u201cA game?\u201d Chel looked at Alex with unfocused eyes, brow furrowed. Something was seriously wrong. Chel never got that drunk.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019ll be fun!\u201d The men were circling up around Chel on the TV. The hair on my arms and neck stood up. Somebody in the real world was pounding on the door to the room, begging for help, but they sounded distorted and far away, like my head was in a fishbowl. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Alex, I don\u2019t feel so good.\u201d Chel swayed on her feet. Alex was practically holding her upright. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK, Chel, just one quick game and then we\u2019re done, OK?\u201d \n\nAlex was smoothing Chel\u2019s hair away from her face, almost tenderly. The ugly, sinister anticipation in my gut was building. Chel and Alex always had a bit of a thing, but this didn\u2019t seem like their usual flirting; it was a mockery of the sweet way Alex usually treated Chel. His eyes were filled with an odd mix of determination and regret, lust and anxiety.\n\nThe Chel on the TV was too far gone to have any of those same misgivings. Chel was always too trusting of people, quick to see the good in everyone. She smiled broadly and dropped her head onto Alex\u2019s shoulder, wrapping her arms around him in a loose hug. Alex\u2019s frat brothers were circling like sharks. I wrapped my arms around my own waist and fell to my knees, tears streaming down my face.\n\n\u201cSpin the Chel!\u201d somebody yelled. Chel looked up, confused, and Alex grimaced and spun her quickly in a circle. She stumbled into the arms of another fraternity brother. She tried to push at him, but her movements were slow and weak. The guy forcibly kissed her, and then shoved her back toward Alex, who did the same. This continued, Chel tossed about like a ragdoll, sobbing my name in fear and confusion. She looked so lost, so *young*. I quit watching as soon as more hands started grabbing at her, pulling at her clothes. It wasn\u2019t hard to guess what happened next.\n\nI covered my ears and hunched in on myself on the floor, screaming, begging for it all to stop. \n\nI don\u2019t know how long I stayed there. I didn\u2019t even notice that everything had gone quiet until I heard the click of the bedroom door opening behind me. It was loud as a gunshot in the sudden silence. I stood up slowly and moved toward the door in a daze.\n\nI stepped forward and barely registered the sick squelch of the rug under my feet. Red soaked the floor and the bottom 18 inches of the wallpaper, splattered in wide strokes on the upper walls and ceiling. A pile of gore that had once been a person slumped at the top of the stairs. A river of blood ran down the center of the staircase, thick and dark, flowing like a grisly red carpet to the open front door.\n\nI stepped around mangled limbs and stringy viscera as I made my way carefully down the stairs. My mind was completely numb to the carnage; the sound of Chel\u2019s helpless tears still filled my ears. Two steps from the front door, a faint voice gurgled to my left.\n\n\u201cLou\u2026\u201d\n\nPart of me wanted to ignore him. To just walk back out into the night, down County Road 5, back to my tiny, uncomfortable bed in my shitty dorm room, where I would fall asleep and this would all have been a nightmare. \n\n\u201cPlease*,* Lou.\u201d\n\nMovements rigid, I forced myself to turn toward the living room. My breath hitched in spite of my detachment.\n\nThere, on the floor in the middle of a sea of shredded bodies, was what was left of Alex. His blond hair was tinged pink with blood. One of his eyes dangled loosely from its socket; both legs were missing below the knees. He dragged himself toward me with his right arm, nails cracking against the hardwood floor. His left arm, flesh ripped down to bone and sinew, reached out for me, pleading.\n\nI didn\u2019t move. I couldn\u2019t. This was Alex - my best friend since kindergarten, Chel\u2019s prom date, my first and last kiss with a man. This was *Alex*. The man who threw my sister to the wolves. Who raped her. \n\nThe reason Chel was dead. \n\n\u201cDid Chel say *please*, Alex? \n\nAlex choked on a bloody sob. I could see the guilt and shame awash in his one good eye.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t s\u2019posed...go that far.\u201d He coughed; blood spewed in a chunky froth across the hardwood. \u201c*Please*, Lou, \u2018m sorry.\u201d\n\nGroaning in agony, Alex inched closer to me. I remained still, body frozen with indecision.\n\n\u201cShall we spare him?\u201d\n\nIce trickled down my spine. The voice belonged to blue-eyes, there was no doubt, but it was different; a sonorous, echoing whisper, sighing on the wind like it came from everywhere at once.\n\nA long-fingered hand settled on my shoulder. In the corner of my vision, I saw shiny curved, black talons resting near my collarbone. Just around the corners of the living room entryway, beyond my line of sight, I could make out the shadows of huge wings. Feathers rustled, claws tapped and clicked on the hardwood floor, impatient. Alex looked toward the noise, face twisted in fright. Blue-eyes squeezed my shoulder gently.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, child. You weren\u2019t supposed to be here. But we wanted you to understand.\u201d\n\nAlex looked at me again, pleading. He opened his mouth to speak, but I beat him to it.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s all yours.\u201d\n\nAs whatever monsters lurked in the shadows began to advance, the hand on my shoulder turned me away and steered me toward the door. Smooth, black feathers filled my peripheral vision, a large wing curled around my frame to block the sights and muffle the sounds of my former best friend\u2019s demise. I stepped into the cool night air and closed my eyes. Lips brushed tenderly across my temple. \n\n\u201cBe at peace, dear one.\u201d\n\nEverything went black.\n\nI woke up late last Sunday morning, back in the dorms, tucked safely into my bed. For a couple of hours, I almost convinced myself I had dreamed the whole thing. Every trace of the House Omega party has been scrubbed from existence - all of my text messages with Alex about it were gone, none of the sleek, black invitations remained. I thought briefly, hopefully, that maybe it had all just been a grief-induced nightmare.\n\nUntil the news broke that Alex\u2019s entire fraternity and a handful of Chel\u2019s sorority sisters had disappeared into the ether overnight.\n\nThe police have no leads. I know they won\u2019t find any. I drove back out to County Road 5 a few days ago, after half a week of fielding concerned phone calls from my mom. There\u2019s nothing there; just an empty field with an abandoned, decrepit farmhouse rotting in the prairie sun.\n\nAlex\u2019s mom has been calling me, too. To see if I\u2019ve heard from him, if I have any clue what happened. I haven\u2019t told her the truth. I\u2019ve decided that I won\u2019t. Sometimes lies are kinder. She doesn\u2019t need to know what kind of monster her son was, what kind of monster he was killed by.\n\nI spent most of the day today at the cemetery. I sat cross-legged in front of Chel\u2019s headstone, tracing the letters of her name and thinking of everything I should have seen earlier, everything I missed. A shadow fell over me, breaking my reverie. \n\n\u201cMind if I join you?\u201d\n\nI squinted up into the afternoon sun. It was Anna. With everything else that had been going on, I had almost forgotten that she had even been there that night. I guess I had subconsciously catalogued her as one of missing. Apparently, officially speaking, she was never at the party either.\n\nShe helped fill in some of the gaps.\n\n\u201cChel came to me, right after it happened,\u201d Anna said, voice tight. She sat down beside me in the grass, close enough our thighs were touching. \u201cI was furious, ready to call campus police, but she begged me not to. The boys, and some of our so-called sisters, had taken video of the whole thing, she said, and threatened to expose her if she got \u2018too sensitive\u2019 about it. I promised her I wouldn\u2019t call. I wish every night that I had anyway.\n\nI had decided I would connect her with campus resources instead, you know? Support groups for survivors, counselors, that kind of thing. I convinced myself it was good enough. But before I could make it happen she..\u201d Anna choked on the words. She cleared her throat and breathed out harshly through her nose. \u201cWell, I was too late. I would apologize to you, but an apology isn\u2019t good enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have nothing to apologize for, Anna. You tried to help her.\u201d I squeezed her hand. She squeezed mine back.\n\n\u201cStill, I felt like I had to do *something*.\u201d Anna stared at Chel\u2019s headstone, eyes hard. \u201cPeople like the men and women who hurt your sister, they think they\u2019re invincible. Untouchable. And they\u2019re not entirely wrong these days. With enough money, you can get away with anything, right?\u201d She laughed, dry and humorless. \u201cSo I knew I had to reach out to a higher authority.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\n\nAnna smiled grimly. \u201cMy family worships the old gods.\u201d I shivered at that, a chill dancing across my skin. \u201cI called upon a long-forgotten sisterhood, ancient and hungry. If I could deliver them the guilty parties, they promised they could deliver justice.\u201d Her expression softened as she finally looked at me. \u201cYou were never supposed to be there, though. Oh, honey, I am so, so sorry.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t tell her it was okay, because it really isn't. But I appreciated her apology nonetheless. I nodded and squeezed her hand again, blinking back tears.\n\n\u201cSo...what now?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe deed is done.\u201d Anna stood up and dusted the grass off of the back of her leggings. \u201cThey\u2019ll have moved on.\u201d Anna looked at me, long and hard, and bit her lip. She nodded to herself, and reached into her purse. \u201cThey did ask me to make one last delivery, though.\u201d\n\nAnna pulled out a very familiar piece of black cardstock, embossed with gilded lettering. She handed it to me. I took it with a trembling hand.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no pressure, and no expiration date,\u201d Anna said. She started to go, but turned back one last time with a sad, sweet smile. \u201cI really am sorry, Lou. For everything. Chel was the best of us.\u201d\n\nI waited until her figure faded into the distance to look down at the paper in my hands. It was a new invitation, to me, this time:\n\n*Louise Teller*  \n*True of heart and strong of will,*  \n*The Sisters of House Omega invite you into our fold.*  \n*A black candle to summon us; a white candle to turn us away.*  \n*We will heed your call.*\n\nI thought of Chel, crying and confused, stumbling in a dark basement. I thought of Chel, the last time I\u2019d seen her in life, head thrown back and laughing. I thought of Chel, cold and still in the ground beneath me. I crumpled the invitation in my fist.\n\nIt\u2019s quiet tonight; not even a breeze rustles the dying leaves. And yet, a soft wind is disturbing the flame of the black candle I\u2019ve placed in front of my open window. A low, sweet voice floats on the breeze, speaking an old language, and feathers flutter in the dark just past my line of vision.\n\nI was never the type to join a sorority. But I think there might be something to this whole sisterhood thing after all."},"260":{"title":"My Husband Brought Home a Fake Daughter","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/bblq6d\/my_husband_brought_home_a_fake_daughter\/","flair":null,"author":"lifeisstrangemetoo","selftext":"*This is not my child.*\n\nThat was all I could think. \n\n\u201cHoney?\u201d said my husband. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is this?\u201d I said, staring at the little girl I\u2019d never seen before, standing in my house, dressed in my daughter\u2019s clothes. \u201cWhere is Liza?\u201d\n\nMy husband gave me a worried look, and the girl-who-was-not-Liza looked positively terrified. \n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d said my husband. \u201cAre you feeling all right?\u201d\n\n*Why was he evading my question? Why couldn\u2019t he just answer?* I took a deep breath, tried to remain calm.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be all right,\u201d I said, \u201cas soon as you tell me where my daughter is.\u201d\n\nMy husband frowned, and the little girl\u2019s eyes welled up with moisture. My husband placed a protective hand over her shoulder, and leaned down to whisper in her ear. \n\n\u201cGo on upstairs, honey,\u201d he said. \u201cMommy\u2019s not feeling well.\u201d\n\nThe girl wasted no time in doing what he said. She clutched her schoolbooks to her chest and barreled past me, rushing up the stairs. I heard the door of my daughter\u2019s room slam. The look on my husband\u2019s face was a mix of pity and restrained anger.\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been taking your medication,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t try to deny it, I can see it in your eyes.\u201d\n\nI waved my hand in a dismissive gesture. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need them,\u201d I said. \u201cThey make my mind all fuzzy.\u201d\n\nThe anger on my husband\u2019s face became less restrained. Well-etched frown lines beneath his lips deepened. \n\n\u201cDo you remember what happened the last time you said that?\u201d he asked. \n\n\u201cI...\u201d\n\nThe suggestion was enough. A swarm of shattered and confused images flooded my mind, like the wave of nausea that comes before vomit. My husband screaming, covered in blood.\n\n*Look what you made me do!* he was shrieking. *Look what you made me do!*\n\nI felt the floor tilt beneath me, and before I knew what had happened, I found myself falling backwards into my husbands arms. Hot tears were streaming down my cheeks, and my body convulsed with violent sobs.\n\nMy husband gently brushed my hair and whispered in my ear.\n\n\u201cShhh,\u201d he cooed. \u201cIt\u2019s not real, honey. I promise that it\u2019s not real.\u201d\n\nI silently nodded my assent. I let him carry me up to our bedroom and lay me gently down on the bed. He walked over to the dresser where he kept the cocktail of drugs that I took every day to maintain my sanity. I swallowed them gratefully. \n\nSoon my mind was going fuzzy, I could feel myself becoming a pliable zombie that could be told anything, made to do anything. \n\nOf course I knew that it was wrong, that that girl was not Liza. I knew that it wasn\u2019t me who had been driven insane by our daughter\u2019s death, but my husband. I knew he had kidnapped that girl when she was a toddler, and brainwashed her into believing she was Liza.\n\nBut, most importantly, I knew that if I didn\u2019t take my pills, if I shattered his precariously built illusion, that he would kill the girl and start all over again.\n\nJust like he did the last time.\n\n[x](http:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/lifeisstrangemetoo)"},"261":{"title":"The previous tenant of my new flat left a survival guide.

Once the postman had left and I was alone with my thoughts they just continued to get louder. \n\nI thought about Natalia and the cult. About the kids and their nighttime antics. About the committee meeting. Jamie and how much I missed him, Georgia and my burning guilt and Mr Prentice, who was finally making those aforementioned animal noises.\n\nMost of all I thought about the note left for me on move in day. How it had changed everything. My whole life was different now, I was alone and it felt like my new home was attacking from every angle. \n\nI re read the note a few times over my coffee. I worried about my rent, it was tight but manageable. School is currently out in the uk but as a training teacher assigned to a school I still get paid a small amount through the summer. The rent is low and with a second summer job I can just about make it without Jamie. \n\nIt sounds strange. But it felt nice to worry about something normal for a minute; even if I should have been worrying about my survival and the many entities currently trying to kill me. \n\nI didn\u2019t get to stew for too long, I had to get ready for the committee meeting. After the events of the night before and my growing mistrust of prudence it was imperative that I got the neighbours on side if I was going to achieve anything like my goals of eradicating the imposter\/cultist neighbours. \n\nThe meeting was at noon in flat 31, there was a poster on a communal notice board by the entrance that I was glad to spot, Terri hadn\u2019t mentioned the time when we met and all our meetings since had been a bit hectic to discuss it. The poster promised tea and cakes and my stomach rumbled at the thought, I hadn\u2019t eaten properly in days.  \n\nAt 11.55 I left the flat, and wandered out into the corridor. I\u2019d never seen so many neighbours. Mr Prentice, however, was still making that awful noise and I watched in disbelief as every single person in the corridor walked past his door as if it was silent. \n\nI did my usual deliberation on whether to take the stairs or lift but yet again the stairs won. I still couldn\u2019t bear being where Jamie died and all these extra flights were keeping me fit.\n\nFlat 31 belonged to an older lady named Molly Thompson and her husband Eric. She had a blue rinsed head of curls attached to her head and had gone to the effort to make homemade batten-burg cake. Other neighbours had bought along baked goods as well. It reminded me of a school fair.\n\nThe flat itself was decorated for the 70s, with plenty of china cat ornaments littered around. I sat down on a dusty plastic garden chair, one of many that Molly seemed to have acquired and laid out for the residents pouring in. I hadn\u2019t seen community spirit like this in my life. \n\nI smiled as I saw Terri, Eddie and Ellie wander in. It was nice to see some familiar faces. I had noticed people looking at me, wondering who I was. It probably wasn\u2019t often they got new neighbours. Eddie came running up to me, swung his arms round me and sat down in the rickety garden chair next to mine. It was so sweet. Terri smiled at me and took a seat the other side of mine, Ellie sat next to her brother. The brown puppy dog eyes were back. No claws.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you came!\u201d Terri said to me, loud enough to hear over the voices of the other neighbours. \u201cI really want you to see the good side of the block. We don\u2019t bite really!\u201d She laughed nervously as she realised the irony of her statement. \n\n\u201cTerri I need help, we need to stop those people from coming back again and from terrorising people. The block can\u2019t go on like this.\u201d I wanted to make the purpose of my attendance clear to her, it was time for things to change. \n\n\u201cBut if you don\u2019t let them in then they don\u2019t bother you. I\u2019ve spoken to the kids, they know not to do it again, that those people are dangerous.\u201d She paused for a moment and sighed. \u201cAlthough them running away didn\u2019t help, the kids think they\u2019re indestructible now. They\u2019ve been telling me all morning that they\u2019re going to kill the bad guys.\u201d \n\nShe looked so resigned. But it was true, they did run away from the twins. Maybe there was something in that, I knew they could die I just had to work out how. But as the thought crossed my mind and I looked at Eddie and Ellie, I couldn\u2019t imagine taking the risk.\n\nI could\u2019ve flat out gone back and asked Prudence. But to be honest I didn\u2019t want anything to do with her. She gave me such a bad feeling. I was doubting everything she told me.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you can keep them away. We can\u2019t all live in fear. Yours aren\u2019t the only kids in this building.\u201d I knew this from surveying the room. \u201cBut I bet not all the kids here are as ... special ... as yours. What if another family burns to death because their kids were hyper one night.\u201d\n\nI could see this struck a chord with Terri. She looked at me with glassy eyes as if on the verge of tears. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. Molly\u2019s the chairwoman and she can be a little strict but you can bring it up under any other business.\u201d She spoke with a lump in her throat. \u201cHere you go by the way.\u201d She handed me a piece of printed paper. \n\nAny other business felt a bit lacklustre but it would do. As long as it got discussed. \n\nI turned my attention the the piece of paper, it was the agenda for the meeting. For something written so formally it appeared farcical. It seemed other flats and floors had different but equally strange issues to mine. \n\nThere were only 6 items on the agenda for the meeting with AOB as the 7th. They were as follows. \n\n*1. Welcome and introductions with apologies for absence.*\n\n*2. Replacing of the flickering lights on floor 11, it seems to incite vicious behaviour from the pets and elderly of that floor.*\n\n*3. Serving a formal residents letter of concern to the man who doesn\u2019t move from the bottom of the stairwell on floor 5.*\n\n*4. Finances - budgets for general maintenance and the annual barbecue.*\n\n*5. The stairs with no grip leading up to floor 14 at the very top and the health and safety hazards this presents.*\n\n*6. Soundproofing of Mr Prentice\u2019s flat, number 48.*\n\nI was comforted to know that I wasn\u2019t alone in dealing with all these strange occurrences. I was also chilled to the core to know for certain that it was the entire building that was more than a bit odd. \n\nWhat really struck me as odd is that when I thought about it, I had seen that man on floor 5 when going down the stairs. But I\u2019d never noticed that it had been every time, or that he had never moved, until this moment. \n\nThe meeting begun with a loud and dissatisfying clink. \n\nBy this point the tiny, 70s themed flat was packed. Garden chairs had all ran out and people were standing. Molly Thompson stood up from her floral patterned arm chair and bashed a teaspoon against the outside of her cup. \n\nShe reminded me of a very strict, disciplinarian school teacher I had worked with during my university placement. She commanded quiet in the room. \n\n\u201cI think we should get started everyone!\u201d She shrilled, her voice growing louder with every word until the crowd came to a silent hum.\n\n\u201cRight, firstly, we are not going to skip the introductions today. Apologies have been given by Jo and Steph of flat 2 and yet again by Mr Prentice. We have a new face in the room as I\u2019m sure many of you have noticed.\u201d She gestured to me and looked in my direction but didn\u2019t really make any eye contact. She was just talking about me as I sat in the room. Eventually she addressed me directly. \n\n\u201cStand up dear, introduce yourself. We\u2019re pleased to have you here.\u201d\n\nI was deeply uncomfortable. I could feel some sort of panic coming on. I never liked standing in crowds very much. But I stood up anyway. \n\n\u201cErmm, hi. My name is Kat. I live in flat number 42, I moved in with my boyfriend Jamie but he was killed in the lift by the weird rat creatures you people have living here. The people that claim to live in the burned out flats won\u2019t leave me alone and one in particular seems to want me dead. Oh, and that window cleaner outside my flat makes me want to scoop my own eyes out with a spoon every time he knocks on the door. Nice to meet you all.\u201d The crowd had gasped a little.\n\nI sat down. Instantly mortified, I don\u2019t know what happened, the normality and structure of the meeting overwhelmed me. There\u2019s something about a sense of order and normality amongst chaos. It does something to your brain, and for me, for the first time in this whole journey, it sent me into a meltdown. \n\nI sobbed as I hit the chair, both in pure mental exhaustion and disappointment that I had blown my chance at building any sort of army against Natalia. Terri rubbed my shoulder. Molly broke the awkward silence that had blanketed the room. \n\n\u201cNice to meet you Katherine, I understand life in this building can be a little overwhelming. We did ask the previous occupant to let us intervene when you moved in but she was insistent. In hindsight we may need to review our policies on new tenants. I am so very sorry for the loss of your partner. The lift is a most unfortunate situation.\u201d\n\nShe had been in positions of power in her life for certain, she responded professionally but coldly, there was no feeling in her condolences. She came off like a corrupt politician digging themselves out of a hole. She did decide to skip the introductions after my outburst.\n\nI also hate it when I\u2019m called Katherine. My parents named me Katie and I shorten it to Kat. Her presuming it was Katherine added to her school teacher demeanour. \n\nShe carried on with the proceedings pretty swiftly and interesting characters present at the meeting started to emerge. \n\nMy favourite was a large middle aged Caribbean woman named Precious St Fluer who would not accept Molly\u2019s claims that there was not enough in the budget to replace the lighting on floor 11.  \n\nShe got up and lifted her shirt to reveal a large deep bite mark across her stomach caused by her dog after a long episode of the lights flickering. When that didn\u2019t change Molly\u2019s answer she lifted her trouser leg to reveal a smaller, but still noteworthy bite mark on her leg, from her elderly mother who lives with her. Molly didn\u2019t budge.\n\nIt took what felt like an eternity to get to any other business. If I weren\u2019t so focused on my goal I would have enjoyed hearing about the quirks of the other floors, maybe tried to engage a little, but I just couldn\u2019t concentrate. \n\nWhen the chairwoman asked if anyone had any other business she scanned the room quickly. I stood up from my chair and she locked in on me with her eyes. \n\nMy hands were shaking and I could feel a cold sweat forming all over my body.\n\n\u201cKatherine, what can we help you with dear?\u201d She asked in a patronising tone. \n\n\u201cI want help in getting rid of the people pretending to be from the burned out flats. I can\u2019t be the only person that doesn\u2019t like living in fear.\u201d I stated boldly, trying not to break down again.\n\n\u201cDear we have had this discussion multiple times and it\u2019s been taken off the agenda. I am aware you\u2019re new here but there is nothing we can do about certain problems within this building and for this particular issue we would appreciate you not letting them into your home and ignoring them like the rest of us.\u201d She snapped back. \n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not good enough! Terri\u2019s kids answered the door last night, they\u2019re children, it\u2019s easily done, what if someone else\u2019s child does it and aren\u2019t so lucky to survive. One burned my friend so bad a few nights ago that she\u2019s still unconscious in hospital.\u201d This I knew from social media. \n\nA few people called out in agreement with me from the crowd. \n\n\u201cThe only one who has ever been able to deal with them is Prudence. And that difficult woman never revealed her methods. Don\u2019t think we didn\u2019t try. You\u2019re suggesting a suicide mission. You\u2019d do well to remember you are new here.\u201d Molly hissed through her teeth. \n\nDid she have to mention I was new so many times. It was grating on me. \n\n\u201cWell I\u2019m willing!\u201d Shouted Precious. She seemed stronger than the rest in her earlier rant. I was glad to have her on side. \n\nWhere she came forward, a few others followed. Soon I had 5 people plus myself willing to form a sub committee to get rid of the cultists. Molly didn\u2019t like it but she agreed to let us do it.\n\nThere was me, Precious and Terri along with lady named Shanti who lived a few doors from me. \n\nA man named Anton and his friend Leo from floor 8 made up the group. To be honest they just seemed keen to get involved with any kind of battle. Leo was the loud one, Anton was mostly silent. \n\nI invited them to my flat after Molly swiftly adjourned the meeting. Inviting anyone into my home made me anxious now. I found myself studying each of their faces to ensure they\u2019re weren\u2019t too average and I hadn\u2019t invited the wrong people in. I was fairly certain I hadn\u2019t. Eddie and Ellie settled in front of my tv in the bedroom so they didn\u2019t hear our conversation. They may only be kids but I felt safer with them there. \n\nWe discussed for hours how we could bring the imposter people into one place and kill them all. \n\nLeo was particularly creative, he came up with weird and whacky ways to end them; from locking them in a room and blasting with fire extinguishers until they freeze, to herding them into the lift between 1.11 and 3.33 am.\n\nThe whole time I waited nervously for a knock on the door, for them to come for us. But they didn\u2019t. We got time to plan. But despite the time it never really took off, no idea seemed feasible. \n\nI shared everything I knew. My conversation with Prue, the night before in Terri\u2019s flat... everything. Precious listened to my tales intently before speaking.\n\n\u201cDerek would have helped us. He was a great man, he used to turn up at my door in the dead of the night just as those lights started and take my dog for a walk.\u201d She spoke of the gardener with a fondness. \n\n\u201cPrudence told me about Derek. She said he\u2019s been gone since the garden was demolished.\u201d I replied flatly. \n\n\u201cIt was awful when he left. That woman that used to live here was nasty to him. I watched out my window as she tore up the garden. I know she was grieving for that little girl but I know Derek only ever wanted to help.\u201d Shanti spoke up from the corner. She had been pretty quiet the whole time. \u201cHe was the whole reason we don\u2019t have those awful creatures from the lift all over our homes anymore. My brother was killed by one before the agreement. He was 4 years old.\u201d\n\nI twitched as she told her story. Shanti has such sad eyes and speaking about her brother only filled them further with sadness.\n\n\u201cThis is another thing I don\u2019t understand. Why have any agreement, if you managed to kill most of them, why not all?\u201d I asked, feeling anger over Jamie burn through my throat as I spoke. \n\nPrecious laughed. Terri shot her a look from across the room. \n\n\u201cNo ones told you the whole story have they?\u201d Shanti asked, a single tear running down her face. \n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d This was driving me insane, nothing was simple, how could I trust anyone. \n\n\u201cWhen Prudence and some of the others killed the creatures they killed a large group of them in one hit. They had started to work out that food scraps and pet food were attracting them and they gathered all the pet food in the tower block into one empty flat on the floor the fire had happened. They creatures came in droves just like expected and they set the flat alight. Again.\n\n\u201cThe flat was burned to ash on top of preexisting ash. Nothing could survive that.\u201d Shanti was interrupted after this by Leo. \n\n\u201cAnd then 3 giant rat motherfuckers literally rose from the ashes, triple as smart and strong and fucked shit up!\u201d He said, a look of excitement on his face. \n\nShanti rolled her eyes and continued. \u201cSo all Prudence did was cause a quite literally bigger problem. She didn\u2019t kill them, all she did was help them evolve.\n\n\u201cThere was only three of them but they learned to sneak attack. More people died than during the original infestation. They were more intelligent but not in the way it comes across when the agreements spoken about. We couldn\u2019t speak to or reason with them.\u201d\n\nTerri was looking at the floor. \n\n\u201cOnly Derek was able to do that, he spoke to them like he spoke to the garden. He made it safe for everyone again, I wasn\u2019t there. I was too young but there we were told he didn\u2019t even have to use words. They understood just a series of movements and eye contact. \n\n\u201cDerek explained the rule with the lift. He told us it was a gesture of goodwill. The creatures needed a home and seemed attracted to the building and we would let them live there and stop killing their kind if they would stop killing ours. But to show them some respect we would allow them a small time frame where unleash their instinctual nature. But only if someone came to them.\n\n\u201cThere are only 2 left now. Prudence killed the other during what happened with her granddaughter. But that only made them 2 stronger. Like they absorbed the 3rd.\u201d \n\nI tried to take in all the information I was receiving but I couldn\u2019t. It was too much. \n\n\u201cDerek isn\u2019t coming back, it\u2019s been years, this is pointless!\u201d Terri finally erupted. Precious laughed again.\n\n\u201cHow do you know?! You speak to dear old Prue all the time, know something we don\u2019t?\u201d Precious spoke sarcastically but I think she meant what she said. It was becoming clear that Prudence Hemmings wasn\u2019t too popular in this building. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t speak to her all the time! We just keep in contact, she was always nice to me!\u201d Terri tried weakly to defend herself.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re naive and a pushover! She used you because no one else would give her the time of day!\u201d Precious was about to launch into a full rant on Terri. I was glad Eddie and Ellie were in the other room and couldn\u2019t hear. I wondered if she\u2019d seen them at night. \n\nI decided to stop the rant. This was becoming counter productive and we were getting nowhere with our plans. I interjected and told them all I needed them to leave so that I could sleep. Partly true, although I knew I couldn\u2019t sleep. I had other things to do. \n\nThey all filed out of my flat, Terri and the kids were the last to leave. She gave me a hug as she left and told me to get a proper nights rest, telling me she was always there for a cuppa and a chat. It was sweet. I felt sorry for Terri. The kids hugged me too as they left. \n\nI know she spoke to Prue, but I was certain that it really was entirely innocent. \n\nI sat in the empty flat disheartened that my assembling of an army had turned into a bickering shit show with no real suggestions on how to kill the imposter neighbours. \n\nI felt totally alone. I couldn\u2019t trust Prue or Ian or pretty much anything I thought I knew. Maybe Prue didn\u2019t even kill those neighbours. They only told me half truths about the creatures after all. \n\nI was left alone with my thoughts again. And after a few hours, a good one finally struck me, but I needed supplies.\n\nI left the building and went to the nearest shop to gather the items I needed. For what I needed and the time of night I had to travel to a 24 hour supermarket. It took half hour each way on the bus. But I stayed focused. My bags were heavy and awkward on the way back to the block but if it paid off this was going to be worth it. \n\nI trudged up the stairs. It took me 2 trips and 24 flights of stairs instead of 14 to get everything in my flat and organise myself. \n\nIt only took 16 and a large gym bag that was much easier to carry on the way back down, thankfully. \n\nI passed the man on floor 5 twice. Now I\u2019d noticed him, he made my skin crawl a little. \n\nI walked through the downstairs corridor, diverting away from the main entrance and passing all the ground floor flats to the door at the back of the building.\n\nThe door at the back lead to a small concrete area with a grass strip along the side and a bench decorated with a memorial plaque. This was the blocks outside space. As is typical in the city the whole bench was covered in graffiti. The memorial was unreadable. \n\nI got to work. I dug the strip of grass, turning soil with my new equipment. I had never been green fingered and to be honest the shrubs I had bought had been so heavy I had grown to resent them a little. I worked for an hour and a half. I was sweating and night had come, it was pitch black and I was using my phone torch to see. \n\nI had almost given up until I got up from my crouching position to stretch my knees. I reached my arms out, put down my shovel and took a seat on the bench. \n\nI hadn\u2019t seen him arrive but the man was already sat there. He wore a flat cap and a jacket, despite it being the middle of summer and a beautiful night. He just smiled warmly at the shrubs for a moment without a word. Eventually he spoke. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve missed this place. Names Derek.\u201d\n\nOur journey: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/clvga9\/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app"},"262":{"title":"I was in prison for 15 years. There was a skinwalker in there with us.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/e1eyok\/i_was_in_prison_for_15_years_there_was_a\/","flair":null,"author":"None","selftext":"A little background first. I was serving a 15-year sentence in a penitentiary in southern Arizona. What I was in there for isn't important. During my stay there, there were countless things that happened that no one could explain, and even more that no one wanted to know more about. \n\nIt all started with a prison legend. Supposedly, years ago something awful and unexplainable happened in the prison. Every morning we'd be woken up, and expected to stand near the front of our cells while guards visually confirmed we were present and accounted for. Apparently about a year before I got sent there, the most brutal and unexplainable thing happened during one of these routines. A man who had a cell to himself looked very off during this check. When a guard pulled over another guard to help him check it out, they found it wasn't actually the prisoner they were expecting at  all. It was a totally different man. This man, was wearing the skin of the other man over him. Loosely fitting, draped over him, apparently looked like a real monster. The scariest things were though, was the guy wearing the skin was NOT an inmate. They had no idea how he even got into prison, let alone a cell. Whats worse is that they couldn't even figure out who the hell he was. He wasn't documented anywhere. And whats worse than that? They never even found the body of the man of the skin he was wearing.\n\nPretty grisely stuff, I know. And I realize that's not the go-to definition of a skinwalker, but that's what the prison called him. The Skinwalker. Didn't help that the guy never talked apparently. Anyway, thats what started the whole skinwalker superstition around the yard. Apparently the guy got shipped to a different spot about a month after it happened, and just about everyone in genpop felt all the better for it. I heard about the story on the second day of my stay. Hell of a story to hear to place in your home for the forseeable future.\n\nNow onto the real shit though. Sure, that guy was The Skinwalker, but all he did in the long run was get an old lifer Navajo inmate to tell everyone about actual skinwalkers. It seemed like a lot of the prison culture actually revolved around them. \n\nNow, apparently, skinwalkers are tricky to point out on the spot, but if you manage to survive around one for more than a minute or two, almost everyone can tell the mannerisms are all off. They can mimic human speech but not replicate it. They twitch manically. They have an unnatural gait while walking. But apparently they got better with experience. The old Navajo guy - his name was Carl - said that he was sure there was an actual one among the prisoners. Slowly picking us off over the years. He called it \"The Grandmaster Skinwalker\" at one point. Apparently he thought it had human mannerisms down so well that you might not even be able to tell if it was your cellmate for a day or two. It had to be good he posited one night. He would expect a skinwalker to jump at any opprtunity for a kill. But this one realized it had a revolving door of people to kill coming to it, and masterfully bided its time, as Carl thought, for years.\n\nA lot of guys found humor in it. A lot more were really on edge about it. Every once in a while in prison, people snap. Sometimes you'll find your cellmate swinging in front of your bunk, strung up around the neck by his pant leg. Sometimes you just can't take it anymore. But in our yard, people tended to snap in a very special way. It wouldn't be an outburst at dinner, or a silent suicide in the night. Guys would just stop talking. Hunch over and shuffle around. Any friendships they had would be mostly out the window. They would turn into a loner during rec time, they would let their hair hang in front if their face. \n\nNo one liked to talk about it. Like if they did, it would happen to them next. I felt the same way. I didn't know if it was a skinwalker, or just people going crazy. But I didn't want to find out. It wasn't clockwork or anything, but every time someone snapped in this way, it wasn't more than a couple weeks before they were \"shipped off\" or \"transferred\" to God knows where without anyone else knowing beforehand.\n\nThen there was the nighttime occurances. Short, loud bursts of sound echoed through my cell block during all hours of the night on a regular basis. It sounded like a mix between a pigs dying squeels and nails on a chalkboard. Just another thing no one liked to talk about. Even scarier were the shadows and footsteps. The block was dimly illumanted in the night by a few lights hanging from the ceiling outside the cells. I myself saw shadows flit across my walls on a regular occasion, when there were definitely no guards near my cell. One time near the end of my sentence, I woke up, looked at my back wall and found a perfect silohuette of a person standing there, but when I looked, my bunkmate was asleep, and no one was outside my cell.\n\nAnd the footsteps. Everyone hated the fuckin footsteps. They were the scariest part. In the night, sometimes, more rarely than the shadows, you would hear ungodly fast footsteps. They sounded like wet feet slapping on tile floor. Whatver caused them would fly from one end of the block to the other in a dead sprint. Whatever it was, it was inhumanely fast. If you happened to be awake before it started, by the time you heard the footsteps on one side of your cell and whipped your head around to see the thing run by, it sounded like it was 3 cells past you. Everyone hated the footsteps. I agreed, I thought they were the worst.\n\nI was released from that place about a month ago, and I have more stories than I can count. I swear it was nearly my turn. About a week before I was discharged, my cellmate, and a good friend of mine \"snapped\". In the same kinda way. I didn't sleep for an entire week. Well I did sleep of course but never for more than a few minutes at a time. Never turned my back on the guy. The scariest thing? I woke up one night to him somehow snaking his body through the bars of our cell. For reference, I couldn't get anything past my shoulder through them. The worst part though, he was coming back in to our cell. \n\nOn the day of my release I didn't say a word to him. Just left. He seemed fine with it, so, so was I. I had made it through, 15 years of prison fights, gang disputes and for all I know, skinwalker abductions. I left through the front gates, a free man. As I walked along the fence for the rec yard, I spotted my cellmate, standing off on his own, like he had for the last week or so. I shook my head, not even really sure if it was him anymore. I took one last look over the yard, this time from the other side of the fence. I wish I hadn't.\n\nThere, standing off on his own, on the other side of the yard, was Carl. Slouched over, eyeing the other inmates, and twitching manically."},"263":{"title":"My son asked me to check the closet for monsters.

It was a little after midnight, I think. I went to check on him to see what was wrong and sat by his bedside.\n\n\nHe was wide awake and asked me to check the closet for monsters, which wasn\u2019t surprising given the circumstances.\n\n\nHe\u2019s still just a little kid, and without even taking into account all the crap he\u2019s been put through thanks to my shitty marriage, moving into an unfamiliar, barely furnished home must be a lot to take in for someone his age.\n\n\nAnd you know how they say that your brain always stays half-awake when you\u2019re sleeping in a new environment, right?\n\n\nThat\u2019s all pretty much what went through my mind in a flash as soon as my son spoke.\n\n\nIt was no big deal. It was all normal, I thought.\n\n\nBut something else almost immediately clicked inside my brain, before I even got to look at where my son had pointed to while he made his innocent request.\n\n\nSomething was wrong.\n\n\nI turned my head and looked, and it took everything I had in me to not give in to fear and terror, all for the sake of my son.\n\n\nWhen you become a parent you have to protect your children no matter what, always putting yourself in harm\u2019s way if necessary and spare them any and all kinds of things that might hurt them.\n\n\nThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t freak out. I couldn\u2019t, not when we had barely just started our new life. I had to protect him, and at that point in time as I sat on his bed I only knew one thing:\n\n\nWe had to leave the room.\n\n\nWe had to leave the house *immediately*.\n\n\n\u201cAlright champ, of course\u201d I said, faking bravery.\n\n\nThen I made a request of my own as I lowered my voice and got closer to him:\n\n\n\u201cHey, how about you step outside for a minute? If there\u2019s a monster in there, I\u2019ll have to kick its *BUTT* all over your room!\u201d\n\n\nHe chuckled and said \u201c*okay*\u201d.\n\n\nI made sure to put some extra emphasis on the word \u201c*butt*\u201d because it\u2019s something that always cracks him up when I say it. Fortunately he got stuck on that and not the fact that I was indirectly admitting to the possibility of there actually being a monster.\n\n\nAs soon as he left the room my mind raced as it started to put together the best and most efficient route to take him out of the house while picking my car keys and phone on our way out.\n\n\nWhen I heard the closet doors slowly creaking open behind me I knew it was time to go.\n\n\nI jumped out of the bed, exited the room and grabbed my son. We were out of the door and inside the car and moving in under a minute.\n\n\nI told him I couldn\u2019t sleep so we were going out for some ice-cream to celebrate. He was a little taken aback and asked \u201c*celebrate what*\u201d, to which I replied \u201c*just us two together, I love you buddy.*\u201d\n\n\nIt was by no means a lie, but I just had to make sure that he was alright and wouldn\u2019t think of anything else as we literally fled our new home.\n\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the house was a new environment for the two of us. I\u2019d been there a couple of times before, cleaned it all up by myself and assembled what little furniture we had, so I knew for a fact what belonged where and what didn\u2019t.\n\n\nAnd I know his room didn\u2019t have a closet."},"264":{"title":"I saw something on the evening news that I can't explain","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/9418eh\/i_saw_something_on_the_evening_news_that_i_cant\/","flair":null,"author":"OQS","selftext":"My work friends and I were out at our favourite pub last night. Not a really fancy place but, you know, cheap beer and close enough to home that I don't have to drive. The night started out normally enough, the four of us crammed into a small table off in the corner, mostly talking shop and shitting on our boss. Being this was the middle of the week there weren't too many other people around, maybe around eight or nine others in the whole place. Everybody just kinda keeping to themselves, sorta people you'd expect to see in a pub on a Wednesday.\n\nAnyway, from where I'm sitting I have a pretty good view of the TV behind the bar. Jessie the bartender is kinda lazily flipping through channels and passes by our local news channel. There's a brief burst of orange and red on the screen which I register as a fire happening somewhere, which then disappears as Jessie switches over to the next channel. Something about the image looks oddly familiar though.\n\n\"Hey Jess, can you switch that back?\" I call out to her.\n\nThe news comes back on, and suddenly I recognize the building in the frame. It's *my* building, and it's burning.\n\n\"Holy shit,\" I say, loudly enough that a few people follow my gaze to the television. \"That's my apartment!\"\n\nThe crowd in the bar falls kinda quiet, everybody staring up at the screen now. The screen shows a wide shot of the outside of my building. The camera must be set up on the north end of the block because I recognize a lot of shops on the ground floor - property management, dry cleaner, convenience mart, etc. The top left corner of the building is aflame. It's not a huge fire by any means, but it looks like a few units between the top four floors or so have already been engulfed by the flames. \n\n\"Jesus, man,\" one of my coworkers says. \"That, uh...that sucks.\" There's an uncomfortable murmur of agreement that passes around the table. I mean, I don't blame them, I wouldn't know what to say in this situation either. \"Yup,\" I agree, just as awkwardly. Thankfully, my apartment is only about half way up and located on the west side of the building. I  cross my fingers, hoping my stuff will be okay.\n\nThe camera cuts to a reporter on the scene. He's standing a little further away; looking at the shops in the background I can tell he's across the street on the north-west corner of the building. \"Fire fighters are expected on the scene any moment,\" he's saying, \"and hopefully they'll be able to contain this horrible inferno before it spreads any further. As I was saying before, it's very fortunate that everyone was able to evacuate the building before things got too bad, or who knows what tragic events may have unfolded.\"\n\n\"He's really laying it on thick,\" my other coworkers jokes. I chuckle a bit. All things considered, at the moment it really didn't seem all that bad.\n\nBut then, a few moments later: \"Uh...hang on,\" the reporter on TV says, \"We're getting some updated information. It seems...hang on one moment, while we readjust the camera.\" The previously locked down camera starts to shift, the angle focusing on an area of the building about half way up the west side. All the lights in the building are out except for one. I feel a weird creeping sensation as I start counting the windows from the bottom.\n\nFive up, two over. That's my place. *I swore I turned that light out,* I think at first. Then I see it.\n\nThere's a...person, standing in my window. The camera is zoomed out too far to make out any features, but it definitely looks like a man and it's definitely standing in my apartment. I watch petrified as the camera zooms in closer, the reporter babbling on about \"the overlooked, ill fated soul still trapped in the blazing such and such.\" As the image gets closer, I start to make out more details.\n\nThe person is...dancing. Or something. I don't really know how to describe it, but he's moving around a lot, and everything he's doing has this bizarre rhythmic quality to it. He starts waving his arms in the air, back and forth, back and forth, and then he's waving them up and down at his sides. Then he's banging both fists on the glass. Then he's waving his arms over his head again, back and forth. Everything he's doing is to the exact same tempo. 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4. He starts jumping up and down, waving his arms over his head like he's trying to get someone's attention from a long distance, but everything is to the exact same rhythm. Over and over again. 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n\"What in the fuck,\" I say, my voice a hoarse whisper. And then the camera gets a little closer, and finally we can make out the person's features. \n\nIt looks almost exactly like me. It's wearing the exact same clothes that I'm wearing now, clothes I changed into moments before leaving the apartment earlier. Its face looks almost exactly like mine as well, except for its eyes. Its eyes are far too big for a normal person. It also has this almost comical look of horror on its face...I don't even know how to describe it. Imagine if someone were pretending to look scared, but as a joke. It would have almost seemed funny if the circumstances were different, but instead it was just extremely unnerving.\n\nNo one in the bar is talking now. Everyone is fixed on the TV. The \"person\" is still swaying and waving around, beating its hands on the glass or jumping in circles. I almost don't hear the reporter mention the fact that firefighters have rushed into the building and are now heading for my floor. *Oh god,* I think, without really understanding what was happening. *Please don't go in there.*\n\nI stare transfixed at the screen. From this angle you can just barely see the top of my front door through the window, not too far behind where this creature is flailing around. Right now it is holding it's face in his hands and shaking it's head from side to side as if saying no. Suddenly the door behind it bursts open as, presumably, the firefighters have entered my apartment. \n\nThe creature stops moving. For a second, I see its expression change. The comical look of horror is gone, replaced by a huge smile filled with enormous, pointed teeth. Then the lights go out.\n\nWe all just sat there, staring at the screen as the camera slowly zoomed out from the now dark window. No one says anything as we all quietly pay our bill and leave. I went directly to my sister's place across town and asked to stay with her. I told her there was a fire at my apartment and that's it. When I tried to find footage from the news online later that night, it seemed like they had edited that last part out.\n\nI don't know if any of you on this subreddit know what that thing was, but I hope they didn't put out that fire. I hope they let the whole fucking place burn to the ground."},"265":{"title":"Mr. Lakavote","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/82183q\/mr_lakavote\/","flair":null,"author":"nocturnalnanny","selftext":"I\u2019m not sure if this will help anyone, but if my story saves even one person from the nightmares I now endure, I will consider it a win. I have borrowed a phone that was smuggled in here, and the orderly, that now monitors every move I make will be coming shortly, so I must be brief. \n\nA few days ago, I was laying in bed scrolling through Reddit, like I always do to make myself sleepy, when I came across this story that sent shivers up my spine. \n\nAfter I was done reading, I thought to myself, \u201cwow, that was terrifying,\u201d and then scrolled to the next one. Big mistake. \n\nTwenty minutes later, I heard a scratching noise coming from my bedroom door and I froze. Confused, as I live alone, I turned on the lamp next to me and looked towards my bedroom door. \n \n*silence.*\n\nAfter a moment, I decided it was my mind playing tricks on me. After all, I was reading scary stories in the dark. Probably not the best thing to do before bed, but hey, who doesn\u2019t love a good spine-chilling story before they close their eyes. \n\nI went back to scrolling through r\/nosleep when again, I heard a long scratch on the door. I slowly got out of bed and tip-toed over to the noise. Grabbing the door handle, I gently opened it and peeked into my living room, only to find it vacant.\n\nI quietly closed the door and turned to walk back towards my bed, when my closet door flew open! Now, I don\u2019t know about you guys, but when it comes to fight or flight reaction, I seem to choose the option that leaves you frozen in place with your eyes closed. A defense mechanism instilled in me from childhood and stories of the boogeyman. \n\nAfter a moment, I decided to open my eyes and cautiously look towards my closet. I physically heard the clock that was placed on my night stand stop ticking, and that\u2019s when I met him. \n\nHe was almost 8 feet tall, standing on long spiny looking legs, with impossibly long arms that seemed to stretch on forever. What I could see of his body looked to be covered in deep dark cracks. He was wearing a long hooded cloak that touched the floor, as black as midnight on a moonless night, that slightly revealed his ruby red eyes. \n\nWh- who are you? I said with a shaky voice.\n\nHe never physically moved his mouth, but I heard him speak into my soul with the most sinister voice, \u201cI am Mr. Lakavote and I am here to right your wrong.\u201d\n\nPetrified, frozen in place, I tried to ask him what wrong I had done, but before I could finish he was right in front of me. His breath smelled of rotting flesh and death itself as he breathed down my face. \n\nHe reached out and ran his long boney fingers across my cheek, and instantly I knew what he could do. I felt my eyes being ripped from my head and the burning sensation that followed. I began to scream, but no sound came out. I was stuck in my own personal hell as darkness surrounded me. Alone and afraid. I wanted to die. I wanted the agony to end.\n\nAgain, I heard his voice as if it were my own thoughts, \u201cI am the keeper of votesss, you know what you did. You will right your wrong or I will take your eyesssss, along with your eternal soul. You have 24 hoursss.\u201d \n\nJust as fast as he had appeared, Mr. Lakavote had vanished. \n\nI did not sleep the rest of the night. I had visions of the horror, I had just endured that left me sweating and cold at the same time. Had I dreamt the whole thing? Could my mind even make up something so sinister and evil? And the pain, oh Lord the pain I felt, I have never experienced anything close to that kind of suffering in my entire life.   \n\nThe next morning, pacing my apartment, I tried my hardest to think of what I had done wrong. Did I forget to vote in our recent election? Had I missed an employee poll at work? What the hell had I not voted on that was so important that my soul depended on it? \n\nTrying to clear my head, I decided to open Reddit, as it always seemed to make me feel better and relaxed. While I was scrolling, I passed the story I had read the night before. The one that had made the hair on the back of my neck stand. \n\nThat\u2019s when it clicked. I had scrolled to the next one before I gave that story the upvote it deserved. Instantaneously, I clicked on the up arrow and waited, hoping with every part of my being that, that was the answer. Was I playing a guessing game with my life? \n\nI waited the whole day, I didn\u2019t eat, I didn\u2019t move, I barely even breathed. I thought about writing to my family and sorting my goodbyes out but, I felt too incredibly empty to conjure up the words. No one would believe me anyways. \n\nAs the sun slowly set, I decided I might as well wait in my room and hope that I had redeemed myself, or possibly chance losing my eyes and my soul. The thought of that alone made me vomit into the trash can next to my bed and tremble violently with deep, petrifying terror. \n\nWhen my 24 hour mark finally came, I closed my eyes, held my breath, and waited. Prayed. Begged, that my soul would be saved and all would be forgiven. \n\n*silence*\n\nThen, I heard the breathing, I smelled the rotting flesh, I felt all the hair on my body raise. When I finally opened my eyes, I felt a chill that froze me to the bone, as if I was sitting inside a freezer meant for the dead. There he was, right in front of me. His eyes had turned to sapphires as he stared into my soul. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let it happen again\u201d, he bellowed in a voice that to this day still haunts my dreams. Then he was gone. \n\nI know some of you won\u2019t believe me. Hell, I\u2019m not even sure if I believe myself. As the doctor here says, \u201cit\u2019s all in my head\u201d. But, for the love of your eyeballs and your soul... do ***NOT*** forget to vote while you are reading stories on Reddit, or you too will have the \u201cpleasure\u201d of meeting Mr. Lakavote for yourself. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"266":{"title":"The previous tenant of my new flat left a survival guide.

I felt no pain at all from the burn on my face, everything was numb. The relief of eradicating the imposter neighbours and the joy at finding a friend in Derek was hacked away in an instant. Just like every leaf from my shrubs. Why would she do this? What had I ever done to her? \n\nEvery question possible crossed my mind. I could feel the frustration bubbling inside me, everything about this place just threw up question after question and for every answer I got, there were ten new questions waiting to be asked. At that moment in time though, only one was truly important. \n\nHow did Prudence know? \n\nI thought about Terri and her telephone conversations. I didn\u2019t want to think that the sweet lady I thought Terri had turned out to be would do that, but it did cross my mind. I thought of Ian the postman, I\u2019d had bad vibes from him for a while, maybe he\u2019d seen Derek coming up the stairs while on his rounds that morning.\n\nI stood there frozen pondering all these things until I saw Prudence collapse onto the memorial bench sobbing, head in her hands. She was surrounded by the remains of my attempt at a garden with the shears laid out on the floor. \n\nThe stairs were kind to me on the way down, it took 4 flights to make it to the bottom. I ran down the corridor and out the back entrance of the block, no idea what I was going to say. \n\n\u201cPrudence!\u201d Was all I could manage. Nice one, Kat.\n\nShe sat bolt upright before turning and standing quicker than I thought it possible for an old lady. \n\n\u201cYou evil, stupid little girl! Do you have any idea what you\u2019ve done?!\u201d She screamed, so much animation in her face that the spaces between her wrinkles pulsated like veins on an angry weightlifter. \n\n\u201cMe?! You think I\u2019m evil! You left that shitty note hidden, missing everything I need to know and got my boyfriend killed! And what you\u2019re doing to your own -\u201c I screamed, tears beginning to roll, before she interrupted me. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare talk about her!\u201d Her voice cracked and she broke down again, this time falling to her knees, twigs and leaves sticking to the bottom of her dress. \n\nI didn\u2019t know what else to do. So I sat down on the floor. I knew that it was probably a bad idea, this woman couldn\u2019t be trusted and I hadn\u2019t forgotten that, but seeing an old lady crying on the cement floor still made me feel awful.\n\n\u201cHow did you know about the garden?\u201d I asked her calmly, trying to change my approach. \n\nShe shoved a crumpled up piece of paper into my hand, she didn\u2019t look at me, her eyes remained on the floor. \n\n*Dear Prudence,*\n\n*I couldn\u2019t exist knowing what I\u2019d done.*\n\n*I should never have told you about it.*\n\n*The last two won\u2019t grow stronger, she was never theirs to begin with. But I have to end her suffering.*\n\n*I\u2019m sorry.*\n\n*Derek*\n\nI knew what he had done as soon as I finished the note. Lyla, or what was left of her, was gone for good. Of all the creatures only Jamie\u2019s killers from the lift remained. That\u2019s how Derek had spent the few hours I\u2019d slept between our encounters. \n\n\u201cThis is all your fault.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cMy whole family are gone because of you.\u201d\n\nThat hurt a lot. I trembled as I tried to speak but I always really hated confrontation and I could feel myself starting to glitch. \n\n\u201cH..how can you say that! I saw... her and she was trapped in a tiny cage eating dog food and small animals. Your family died in that lift. Just like my Jamie.\u201d I may have struggled to get my words out, but I wasn\u2019t about to let Prudence Hemmings blame me for her decisions. Lyla was better off dead than what she was, however awful that may sound. \n\n\u201cWhat happened to your face?\u201d Prudence growled at me. \u201cTake you to visit floor number 9? He did this to her in the first place, not me! And now he\u2019s disfigured you!\u201d She was spinning things. I could feel throbbing as she mentioned my face, I really should have had medical attention. \n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t his fault! You messed him up and he did that to her because of you! You told me that yourself.\u201d I tried ferociously to defend Derek but something inside me still felt uncomfortable about what he had done. I couldn\u2019t help it, Lyla was an innocent little girl who shouldn\u2019t have been punished for Prue\u2019s mistakes. This whole thing was such a mess.\n\n\u201cI was grieving! And then I had her back for all those years, and then I lost Bernie, and then my home and now I have to grieve for her all over again.\u201d Prudence continued to cry, but softer. I looked around at the chaos she created and up at the block my boyfriend had died in and rolled my eyes in disbelief that she could be so selfish. She continued.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you about Lyla. She was a beautiful little girl. As I mentioned before, I have two other older children, they\u2019ve had many other grandchildren, however I hadn\u2019t spoken to my eldest two in years even before what happened with Lyla. \n\n\u201cLyla was my first opportunity to get to know one of my grandchildren. Bernie adored her too, always reading her stories and sneaking her sweets. \n\n\u201cI begged my son to allow her to stay. My children were all incredibly ungrateful, they had it easy growing up and still resented me. I gave them a good, strict upbringing but they didn\u2019t appreciate it. They said I was a cruel mother. Lyla\u2019s dad was the only one I spoke to, but our relationship still wasn\u2019t that of a typical loving mother and son. But she was a second chance. \n\n\u201cIt was a miracle when he agreed. I was more shocked he had convinced his wife to allow it. That awful harlot of a woman never liked me, although I didn\u2019t like her either. \n\n\u201cThey refused to speak to me after everything, I haven\u2019t heard from them since. They had more grandchildren I\u2019ll never meet. I knew at the time my relationships with any of my children were over for good. So when Derek gave me a solution I took it.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t entirely truthful when we first spoke. I said I hadn\u2019t wanted this, but I was desperate. There was never a way to bring her back safely. Derek explained what she would become to me. He was initially trying to put me off even trying to get her back. I knew exactly what I was getting myself into. \n\nBut I couldn\u2019t pass up the idea of my beautiful little Lyla, needing her grandma forever. I suppose I was too ashamed to admit it before. But why should I be ashamed?\n\n\u201cMy altercation with Derek happened after she was back, when he tried to kill her the first time. Spouting the same things on that note, what kind of monster wants to kill a little girl? That\u2019s why I trashed the garden. He said he wasn\u2019t coping with the news of the new block when he suggested it, that he shouldn\u2019t have told me it was even possible and she had to die. I hid her until the bulldozers came in. \n\n\u201cWhen he disappeared I thought I was safe to spend the rest of my life with her. \n\n\u201cBernie hated me. Spending time with Lyla was all I lived for, I grew to love her how she was.\u201d\n\nI felt sick. Listening to Prudence talk bought up so many repressed feelings about Jamie. I hadn\u2019t had time to grieve or process anything, I missed him terribly. My old life and my old future felt a million miles away.\n\nI was relieved to know that Derek hadn\u2019t tricked Prudence, or even intended to create rat-Lyla. He was truly good.\n\n\u201cBut she didn\u2019t get to have a life. You lived for her but she wasn\u2019t really living. How could a sane person do that to their own flesh and blood?\u201d I retorted.\n\n\u201cYou have no idea. This place can make you do irrational things! But she had a life! She had me. It\u2019s all she needed.\u201d She was certainly right about the building and irrational actions, the pain intensifying on my face throbbed in agreement. But I was still convinced she had lost it Dr Frankenstein style where rat-Lyla was concerned. \n\nShe had stopped crying. Her rage levels were rising again. I tried to tell her that it wasn\u2019t really the child she\u2019d known, but she seemed to have grown an entirely new attachment to the creature that replaced what she lost. \n\nEvery rational argument I gave was met with increasing levels of screaming. She got less coherent as she went on. The argument was going nowhere, we went back and forth for what felt like forever.\n\nAfter a while she started to get closer to me. We had both stood up by this point and despite her haggard and frail appearance, Prudence was truly frightening. She looked unhinged. \n\nHer words were no longer going in, I was overwhelmed and had too many thoughts rushing through my mind to process her ranting. I took a few steps back clearing a small distance between us. \n\nBy this point, out of the corner of my eye, I could see neighbours in windows of the block, watching the altercation outside, Prue\u2019s screaming had bought a lot of attention. It was bright and I couldn\u2019t see well but I turned to scan the windows and did recognise Eddie and Ellie watching from their bedroom, trying to wave at me. \n\nThey frantically waved and pointed, I tried waving back and gesturing to them, but they kept pointing at me.... why were they pointing?\n\nThen I heard it, the garden shears scraping against the ground as Prudence picked them up and charged towards me. \u201cYou ignorant little bitch! You aren\u2019t even listening. You\u2019re don\u2019t deserve my home! You killed her!\u201d\n\nThe twins had been telling me to turn around, I shouldn\u2019t have taken my eyes off her. \n\nLuckily, unlike my earlier shock when I had first seen her, I didn\u2019t freeze. My fight or flight instincts kicked in and I ran faster than I ever have before. I burst back into the building and heard neighbours on the bottom floor lock their doors in a symphony of bolts clicking. \n\nI couldn\u2019t blame them. Prudence wasn\u2019t far behind me and I wouldn\u2019t want to take her on in her current state if given a choice. But it didn\u2019t stop me pounding on their doors begging someone to call the police, although something told me that in this building that wasn\u2019t going to happen. I ran up the stairs, still being followed by her. \n\nBy the second floor most were still locked but a few had come out of their homes, armed with a variety of heavy objects. Even in a crisis, I couldn\u2019t fault the community spirit here. I ran another flight of stairs that became two but still lead me to floor 3 and then to the back of the corridor. I pounded on Terri\u2019s door.\n\nMy heart was racing but when I turned Prue was nowhere to be seen. I was hoping the people who came out on floor 2 had stopped her but something was odd. I hadn\u2019t heard any commotion. This wasn\u2019t the end of it.\n\nEddie and Ellie hugged me tight as Terri let me in and bolted the door shut quickly behind me. I told her about what had happened. She couldn\u2019t believe what Prue had done. It turned out no one knew about Lyla. \n\nI was edgy for the first hour. But Prue had disappeared. Terri helped to clean up my burn and put some cold compress on it. She offered to take me to the hospital, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nI was too shaken up from what had just happened, I couldn\u2019t face trying to explain how I\u2019d sustained my injuries and I still hadn\u2019t reported Jamie missing. He still hadn\u2019t had any messages from his family, and work had given up calling, but his friends had started. They were harassing me non stop but I had been too distracted to come up with a decent lie.\n\nIt had been a week since I moved in and it wouldn\u2019t be long until people realised something was seriously wrong. My conversations with my family had been short, with me insisting they didn\u2019t visit until we were \u201cunpacked and set up\u201d. \n\nOn top of a murderous old lady and an untold amount of abnormal issues the real world problems were starting to creep up on me. \n\nI sat with Terri for hours, drinking tea and chatting to her. It started to get dark and Eddie and Ellie came into the living room after playing in their room for a while. The voids replaced the big, brown puppy dog eyes again and their claws looked especially sharp, but to me they were still adorable. \n\nTheir transformation prompted me to head back to my flat, it was late. I needed to work out what to do next and how to dig myself out of this giant hole. I couldn\u2019t just keep planting gardens. I needed to do this myself. \n\nI wandered up the stairs, they went on for a while, but nothing too horrific. I passed the man on floor 5, nodding politely and continuing my ascent. I wondered if he\u2019d received the letter of concern yet, he was a little unsettling. \n\nWhen I got to my floor Mr Prentice was making his animal noises again. I smiled, which hurt my face. After all the madness I was starting to find the seemingly benign horrors of this building oddly comforting. \n\nI reached my flat and turned the key in the door before bolting myself in like Terri had. \n\nI could feel something wasn\u2019t right the moment I entered. The flat was in chaos, which was nothing new because we had only moved in a week ago and I had been too preoccupied to unpack. But things were out of place, the organised chaos wasn\u2019t how I\u2019d left it. \n\nThen she strolled out of my kitchen. Prudence Hemmings. She was carrying a large carving knife in her left hand this time, she had prepared for her attack. She smiled at me and lifted her right hand, jingling a set of keys that she had entered with. \n\nI turned to unbolt the door but she grabbed me from behind before I could turn the handle to open it and held the knife to my throat. \n\n\u201cI will kill you for what you\u2019ve done.\u201d She whispered into my ear. \n\nWithout a second thought I leaned forward just a tad and swung my head back as hard as I could. I couldn\u2019t believe that it worked but I must have broken her nose. Prudence dropped the knife and clutched her face, blood streaming between her fingers. \n\nI went to grab the knife but she was closer and doing the same thing. I had no other option but to run again. I grabbed the door handle and turned it to exit the flat as she tried to stab me. I was mostly out the door, but her arm was close enough to reach my side, and I felt the knife pierce the side of my torso.\n\nI was in searing pain but I didn\u2019t stop running. As I stepped outside my flat I could still hear Mr Prentice\u2019s noises flooding the entire hallway. It gave me an idea. \n\nI ran towards his door, Prudence stabbing at me frantically with blood gushing from her nose. A few got me as I stopped outside flat 48, the pain was awful and I could feel myself starting to drift out of consciousness, I was losing a lot of blood. \n\nI would give my last breath to end Prue. So running on nothing but adrenaline I knocked hard on flat 48, and shouted.\n\n\u201cMr Prentice, can you help me?\u201d\n\nIt was a shot in the dark, I didn\u2019t know what would happen but I had to try something.\n\nShe had stopped stabbing at me, she was enjoying watching me bleed out slowly from the wounds she had already inflicted.\n\nI was incredibly weak, and I lost consciousness not long after that, but before I did I heard heavy clunking from the inside of flat 48, chain locks being released and bolts being undone. I watched with blurry vision as a large creature, that I can only describe as a cross between a bull and a wolf, charged out of the flat and trampled the old witch to death. I heard hear bones crunch just as slipped away. \n\nI woke up in the hospital a day later. My parents were there as were the police, apparently I had been found just outside the tower block with my handbag missing, by a neighbour who had been watching from a window as it happened. \n\nThe police told me that the person had seen the mugging out of their window. They had seen two men approach me and Jamie, splash something in my face, attack us, and when he tried to fight back, they bundled my boyfriend into a car, which the police had been searching for to no avail. He was officially missing. \n\nI was baffled, but grateful that Jamie\u2019s disappearance wouldn\u2019t be blamed on me. I went along with it and made out that he had ghosted work to enjoy our first week living together. \n\nI had been stabbed 4 times but thankfully in all the right places, if there is such a thing as the right place to be stabbed. I lost a lot of blood but I was going to be fine. They were all shallow. They assumed my burns were chemical and happened during the mugging too. \n\nThe police promised to keep us updated but they still can\u2019t find the car. They never will. I wish the story the police had been told were true, it left some hope for Jamie. \n\nMy parents weren\u2019t keen on me returning to the flat after what happened, they said the area was too rough, and that I was living proof it wasn\u2019t safe. They offered to collect my stuff for me. I insisted though, told them that I wanted to see how I felt and they couldn\u2019t force me not to.\n\nI was released from the hospital two days after I woke up in there. When I arrived at the flats, it was strange. It felt like home. Despite everything, something about this place drew me to it. \n\nI took the lift for the first time since Jamie had died. I had to, I wasn\u2019t recovered enough to conquer too many stairs just yet, and I couldn\u2019t guarantee they\u2019d be kind to me. I smiled at the lack of a button 9 and winced at the thought of the creatures. \n\nAs I reached my corridor I saw Mr Prentice walking along with his newspaper and milk in a bag. He turned to me and smiled.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d come back. It\u2019s nice to see you\u2019re up and walking.\u201d He made small talk as if I hadn\u2019t seen him literally trample a woman to death a couple of days prior. The whole experience had been so disorienting that I started to wonder if I really had been mugged and had dreamed the note and everything that\u2019s happened since. Then he said something that confirmed everything was real. \n\n\u201cI never liked that woman. But you\u2019ve got a real friend in the lady downstairs.\u201d He winked at me and turned the key in his door. \n\nI got into mine and sat down on the second hand sofa. I felt empty but relieved. With Prue and the imposter Qneighbours all gone the only threat left were the creatures in the lift, who were only a threat between 1.11 and 3.33.\n\nMaybe I could start to live a semi peaceful life in this place. \n\nTerri knocked on the door, my handbag, that I had left at hers before Prue attacked in my flat, on her arm. Mr Prentice was right, she was a good friend. \n\nI thanked her for what she\u2019d done and for what she\u2019d told the police. She said it was pure luck that she found me, she had been walking up to return the bag and found me and Prue sprawled out on the floor. I asked what happened to Prue\u2019s body and she just pointed in the direction of flat 48. \n\n\u201cHe was eating it.\u201d She said.\n\nIt\u2019s been a few days now and I\u2019ve decided to stay. I can\u2019t imagine going back to complete normality after everything I\u2019ve been through and I\u2019ve grown quite attached to some of the buildings quirks. \n\nI tried replanting the garden with the help of the twins. I ripped a few stitches doing it and Derek never came. I think he\u2019s gone for good.\n\nI\u2019m ready to fully embrace life here. The last few days have been hard but there\u2019s some time to breathe. Along with the time to breathe, came the time to grieve and I\u2019ve been grieving badly for Jamie.  \n\nThis leads me to the last thing I have to tell you. \n\nLast night I laid in bed, plagued with thoughts of Prue and everything that had happened, but what I couldn\u2019t get to leave my mind was how much happiness it bought her to have Lyla back. It infected every part of my thoughts. I know you all warned me not to, but I did it. I repeated the ritual. \n\nI haven\u2019t caught him yet, but I\u2019ve heard the scratching.

Low, monotonic, unwavering. \n\nIn front of me was my mother, crucified haphazardly upon a ramshackle wooden cross. Rivets were driven through each palm - with rope fastenings in place around her ankles and shoulders to keep her in position. \n\nHer eyes, red and cracked from exposure, pulled open by tape, to reveal pupils dilated with fear. \n\nHer mouth was sewn shut. Muffling her tired pleas.\n\n\u201cThis is hardly an existence,\u201d the voice licked.\n\nI surveyed my surroundings. I was in a small, square room, with metal walls no larger than my studio apartment. The roof, however, was missing, replaced by an empty void that seemed to stretch endlessly into the darkness above.\n\nAbout five feet in front of me was my mother. Writhing weakly against her restraints. Five feet behind her, an impossibly tall ladder stretching into the abyss. \n\n\u201cWhat are you waiting for? As if you care,\u201d the voice prompted.\n\nWho was talking? Where was this voice coming from? Its warm presence swaddled me like a warm blanket.\n\nIn one swift surge, the gravity of the situation dawned on me. I didn\u2019t know where I was. I didn\u2019t like being lost. \n\nI felt the kick of adrenaline into my bloodstream. My heart, beating against my ribcage. My hands, clammy. I clenched them repeatedly. Open, closed. Open, closed. \n\nI needed to get out of here. \n\n\u201cEnd her.\u201d\n\nMy gaze dashed to my right hand side to find a surgical stand stocked full of pain-inflicting paraphernalia. \n\nA knife. A rope. A pistol. Razor blades, full needles, strange pills and powder. \n\nAn arsenal fit to maim, disfigure, destroy.\n\nI reached for the razor blade. I could cut the stitching on my mother\u2019s mouth - garner some insight into what the fuck was going on. \n\nMy mother always knew what was going on. \n\nWith the razor blade in hand, I walked gingerly up to my mother - whose eyes lit up as I approached. \n\nAnd through all the pain, tears and stitches, as I drew closer, she smiled. \n\nI held up my left hand to coddle my mother\u2019s face, with the razor blade still pinched in my right. \n\nAnd as she nuzzled her face into my palm, I cracked. I wept harder than I\u2019d ever wept before. Full-bodied, wracking sobs crashed over me. \n\nBecause it didn\u2019t matter how bad anything got. It didn\u2019t matter how broken the situation, or how broken the person. \n\nMy mother was just happy I was there. \n\nI steadied myself and lifted up my right hand, trembling as I drew closer to her face - ready to pick away at the stitches to the best of my ability. \n\nThe first few snapped, then the next, until all the stitches had been split and I had liberated her mouth from its cage. \n\nI exhaled raggedly, leaning back to look deeply into my mother\u2019s eyes. \n\n\u201cM-Mum?\u201d\n\nBut as tears fell down her cheeks, through her warm, loving smile, she uttered one word. \n\n\u201cClimb.\u201d\n\nI peered past her towards the ladder, then looked back towards her for reassurance. It took a slow, simple nod to realise that this was what I had to do. \n\nAnd as I walked slowly towards the ladder, she murmured one last thing. \n\n\u201cI love you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you too, mum.\u201d\n\nI never said that enough.\n\nThen, with razor blade still in hand, I climbed. I climbed with determination. I climbed for what seemed like hours. \n\nI climbed past broken rungs, and even when I was tired, I kept on climbing. \n\nI cried as I climbed, but I pushed through, with snot dribbling down my chin and tears clouding my vision. \n\nI reminisced as I climbed. I climbed through good memories, I climbed through bad memories. I climbed through the time when I had the flu and my mother came around to do my laundry, and I climbed through the time my girlfriend cheated on me. \n\nI climbed because I was sick of this dark room. I climbed to make my mother proud. \n\nAnd as I climbed, the darkness subsided, opening itself up to light. \n\nI could see the where the ladder ended now. I could see my way out. \n\nAs I placed my hand on the last rung of the ladder and pulled myself up over the edge, I was overcome by brightness. \n\nThe light subsided, and as I got my bearings, I found myself on my back in my bathtub, still clutching the razorblade. \n\nUrgent knocking on my bathroom door roused me from my daze.\n\n\u201cAre you alright in there? Your sister called. We\u2019re worried about you.\u201d\n\nIt was my mother\u2019s voice.\n\nI got up out of the bathtub, and placed the razorblade back on the shelf, walking towards the door. And as I flung it open, she looked at me. She looked at me and she knew. \n\nShe held me in her arms and we sobbed. \n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know how to live without you,\u201d she whimpered.\n\nMy climb had just begun."},"268":{"title":"The previous tenant of my new flat left a survival guide.

The way her skin melted off her face, the smell of her hair burning and the sound that she made. \n\nI didn\u2019t have time to count but there were more than I originally thought. I figured these must have been the 15 people Prudence talked about, entering the flats that burned before it happened. I already knew that Natalia was one of them. \n\nEddie and Ellie clutched Terri\u2019s skirt, trembling with fear. I wanted to help protect them, but I still couldn\u2019t help but tremble a little myself every time I caught a glimpse of those hollow voids where their eyes were. \n\n\u201cHi Terri, the kids said we could borrow some sugar?\u201d She asked menacingly, grinning at the frightened family stood next to me. After a moment or two of intense staring Natalia finally addressed me. She appeared to be the spokesperson for the group. \u201cHow\u2019s your friend doing? It was a shame we had to end our visit. I was enjoying her company.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t speak about her! She\u2019s got nothing to do with you, you sick bitch!\u201d I screamed at her, I couldn\u2019t bare looking at her face again. \u201cYou don\u2019t scare me with all your freak friends. I\u2019m not going to let you hurt this lady or her kids!\u201d\n\nNatalia chuckled. I gulped. \n\nI may talk a good game but I am no hero. Mere days ago I was just a young girl excited to move in with her boyfriend and now here I am. My boyfriend\u2019s dead, my flat is like living in my own personal horror movie and I\u2019m standing up challenging demonic flame neighbours to defend demonic looking children. \n\nBut when I said she didn\u2019t scare me, I meant it. Something inside me was eradicating any fear of these people, I just wanted to protect the residents. Life really does throw curveballs. \n\n\u201cI know you aren\u2019t scared. I saw it in your eyes when you stuck that big knife in my throat. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\n\n\u201cMy brothers and sisters are not freaks. You\u2019re the freaks! Thinking that your lives have meaning. We watch you people go about your day to day lives and your mundane routines and nothing really changes. Your lives are pointless and disposable.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we set the fire, all those years ago.\u201d  She chuckled throughout her words. There was an animation in them like she was a psychotic cartoon character, finally catching its prey after 138 episodes of chasing. \n\n\u201cThose people weren\u2019t disposable...\u201d Terri mumbled, barely a decibel higher than a whisper.\n\n\u201cWhat was that Terri? Did you have something to say.\u201d Natalia went from psychotic cartoon to school bully. She made my skin crawl.\n\n\u201cI was only a child, but those people were friends of my parents, they were good people.\u201d Terri said with slightly more confidence. \n\nNone of the other people had moved. They just stood there staring. \n\n\u201cWhy would you burn people alive? What can you possibly gain?\u201d I interjected, taking a slight step between Natalia and Terri and the kids. I could see she was getting ready to go for them and I couldn\u2019t let it happen. \n\n\u201cWe were living with the great leader, Michael. All of us. Living in the righteous manner that he had directed us to live\u201d She gestured to the people around her. The name Michael appeared to inspire some sort of emotion in the group. \n\n\u201cMichaels brother Jonathan lived here, on the floor we burned. He let us hang out there sometimes, but he didn\u2019t live the righteous way that we did. He didn\u2019t like our beliefs, but he took us in when we lost the place we were staying because of the growth of the group. Him and Michael rarely saw eye to eye. They argued passionately. \n\n\u201cOur group never believed in living within the constraints of societal norms and we were up at all hours, we came and went as we pleased, embracing freedoms and listened to music as we did introspective work.\u201d \n\nTerri shoved the kids further behind her and snapped, infuriated. \n\n\u201cYou were a group of entitled, bratty hippies following some middle aged, mentally ill twat. Listen to yourself! The stereotypical cultish drivel coming out of your mouth right now!\u201d Terri cried. I was shocked at her outburst. Although I couldn\u2019t have agreed more. It did sound like cultish drivel. It made me so angry that this was what an entire floor of people died over. \n\nAs Terri ended her rant the curtains hanging on the window behind her burst into flames. I jumped and felt my heart skip a beat. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t insult us. I\u2019m sick of hearing simple minded people call us a cult.\u201d Came from the back row. An average looking man with dark hair and jeans had piped up, smiling and watching the curtains burn. He had done that. They were all capable of what Natalia had done to Georgia at the very least.\n\nFor the first time since the people had entered Terri\u2019s flat my nerves of steel had wavered. I realised that we were only alive because they were allowing it so far. We were in big trouble.\n\nTerri swiftly shut up and Natalia continued her story.\n\n\u201cMichael was the true leader. Not like all the fakes you hear of in the news. The people you\u2019re talking about. He was teaching us to build a world of peace and harmony. But he didn\u2019t deny that in order to do that you had to eradicate the non believers. He taught us to embrace the bad in us. To harness it so that we could do extraordinary things.\u201d She smiled wickedly as her hands glowed hot coals as she spoke. \n\nIt may have sounded like cultish drivel but Michael being a total faker wouldn\u2019t explain their powers. \n\n\u201cThings went wrong when someone went to the police after Michael and Jonathan had a terrible argument one night. When the police arrived Jonathan told us to go. \n\nThe group had been planning to leave this building anyway. We\u2019d had nothing but interruption and trouble in our time here, this place is weird. But we had nowhere immediate to go. The police already disliked us after overcrowding the last property. We didn\u2019t need any more attention. \n\n\u201cMichael was furious. We brainstormed in a field for hours who could have done it. I personally suspected the next door neighbour, Mavis. The woman was so nosey, always knocking and asking us to keep noise down, interrupting our spiritual sessions. \n\n\u201cMichael couldn\u2019t make a certain judgement on the person who had done it. All we thought we were sure of was that they had to be on the same floor. So he instructed us to go back that night and eradicate the whole floor and every non believer who lived there. \n\n\u201cAs you know, we obliged.\u201d This incited sick laughter from the crowd. I waited, forcing myself to let her finish. Buying time. \n\n\u201cWe took pleasure in their screams, in watching every man woman and child go up in flames through their front door windows. It was the first time we\u2019d unleashed all that energy and we felt so powerful!\n\n\u201cBut then as we left the burning hallway behind us and entered the stairwell, this building found a way to fuck us over one more time. \n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t give you a number on the amount of times we tried to run down those stairs, leave our glorious victory behind us and return to Michael. It didn\u2019t matter how many times we tried. \n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t make it past that floor, the stairs wouldn\u2019t let us. It didn\u2019t take long before the fire reached the stairwell we were trapped in, burning us all, along with the non believers. We died just in time for the fire engine to arrive. \n\n\u201cWe may have been dead but we didn\u2019t disappear. We couldn\u2019t leave the building, we were stuck just wandering it, in and out of the burned flats and hallways but not allowed anywhere else unless we were asked. It was awful. We didn\u2019t try to cause any trouble at first. We waited for Micheal to come and find us, instruct us. \n\n\u201cTwo months passed and he hadn\u2019t come. Instead came confirmation. A newspaper put through the door of the building. Headline news. \n\n\u201c*Tower block resident Bernie Hemmings information vital to imprisonment of local cult leader on drug charges.*\u201d\n\nI gasped. I couldn\u2019t believe I hadn\u2019t found that when I was researching Prue. But I suppose local news wasn\u2019t so heavily online back then. Natalia saw my shocked expression and grinned wider than before.\n\n\u201cThe old bat didn\u2019t tell you that then?\u201d She asked, although it wasn\u2019t really a question. \u201cThat her stupid husband is the whole reason we\u2019re here!\u201d \n\n\u201cWe started to really cause issues then. Did anything within our power to fuck the whole building over. But it didn\u2019t take them long to work out that we had to be asked to come in. \n\n\u201cWe only stopped when Prue worked out a way we could die a second time, and that we wound come back again. She killed two of our group. She was the only person that could stop us. We couldn\u2019t do shit with her around. We stopped and reached a stalemate. Then she moved out. We were going to honour that stalemate. Until you stabbed me. Prue\u2019s gone. It\u2019s fair game in here now.\u201d\n\nAs Natalia got angrier a member of her group started getting agitated, they all soon followed like a hive mind, working as one, the stillness became chaotic, with all of them moving and making noise. \n\nI didn\u2019t notice at first when one started walking towards Terri and the kids, but I noticed when it got near.\n\nIt was a teen girl, slender and pretty, but still unsettlingly average. As she got within a metre of the family Ellie suddenly went rigid. The claws that replaced her fingernails grew longer and sharper, with jagged edges from growing so fast. The voids deepened, if that was even possible. \n\nShe opened her mouth to reveal rows of sharp teeth, blood caked where the tooth meets the gum where they had grown too quickly as well. Ellie jumped. She reached out towards the girl and slashed her face with the claws, leaving deep gouges across her eyes.  She clung on to the girl using her claws as wall pegs keeping herself at eye level. \n\nEddie controlled the crowd. His own claws grew and he ran towards them, sending them scattering out of the flat, random bursts of flames erupted everywhere. Lighting up the whole room. \n\nShit had hit the fan. The two demon children were successfully fending off a group of 15 dead superhuman cultists. Natalia ran from them too, but kept her eyes locked on mine as she did. As she ran from the flat she spoke to me. \n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t over!\u201d She screamed, and I knew that it wasn\u2019t. \n\nI stayed on Terri\u2019s sofa that night, we organised all the burned items in the house and threw things out before we crashed out in the early hours. The kids claws retracted and they returned to their earlier state. Causing mischief in the hallways. They were too young to really understand.\n\nI didn\u2019t sleep much. Nothing new. \n\nWhen I woke up Terri was still asleep. I didn\u2019t want to disturb her so I walked back to my flat, desperate to avoid anything strange on my way. The stairs must have noticed, because they didn\u2019t skip on my way up. \n\nI hadn\u2019t checked the time when I left Terri\u2019s but I reached my door at the same time as a familiar face. Postman Ian was stood there, dropping letters on my doorstep. \n\n\u201cHey, love!\u201d He shouted as he noticed me. \n\n\u201cI need to talk, can you come inside, just five minutes? Please?\u201d I practically begged him at the doorstep.\n\nI told him everything that had happened the night before. How Natalia was out for revenge and I was the object of her rage. I begged him to tell me how to kill them, but he claimed he didn\u2019t know. He said if kept my doors locked and didn\u2019t let them in then I\u2019d be fine. \n\nHe looked shirty as I mentioned killing them. Didn\u2019t even suggest asking Prudence how to do it. Something was telling me there wasn\u2019t much point.  He seemed so disingenuous.\n\nI wanted to trust him. So badly I wanted to trust him. I had been so vulnerable with him over Jamie.\n\nBut if Prudence Hemmings could forget to mention what Bernie had done, and conveniently never pass on the method to kill these awful people, leaving them around to terrorise her friends and neighbours... then could she be a liar too. Could I really trust Ian? \n\nWhen he provided no answers and no real help something inside me told me that I needed to get him out of my flat. I needed to rethink. Start working things out on my own. I made excuses to Ian and sent him on his rounds. \n\nPrudence left me these rules, but she left so much out. How do I know I wasn\u2019t always a pawn in some sick game. Her fantasy life as a puppet master, setting me up to fail. She\u2019s kept her granddaughter in a cage for years. Maybe she enjoys suffering. \n\nI wasn\u2019t going to give up easily though. Natalia wasn\u2019t going to win. \n\nI decided then and there that I needed to attend the committee meeting today and start building an army against Natalia. I didn\u2019t need Prue\u2019s help or her methods. With enough manpower I could do it myself. \n\nThis was war.\n\nThe next steps : https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/ckw07c\/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app"},"269":{"title":"My job is watching a woman trapped in a room.

If Melanie was somehow a fake, that meant they must have sent her.  And if they sent her, that meant they knew.  They knew about the messages in her painting.  They knew about me asking questions.  And they knew I didn\u2019t hit a button during any of it.\n\nI felt panic and fear crawling up my chest, making it hard to breathe.  Standing up, I started pacing, periodically glancing back at the monitor to see if Rachel could help me, tell me what I needed to do next.  But she had laid down on her bed.  It was hard to tell for sure with her back to the camera, but I think she was crying.\n\nNo, I needed to fix this.  Get her out of there.  And if I didn\u2019t have a better plan, I\u2019d just have to go with the one I already had.  \n\nFeeling the hard eye of the ceiling camera on me, I went to the door and stepped back into the locker room.  My phone was in my locker, and after messing up the combination the first time, I got the door open and got it out.  Gripping it tightly, I tried to hold it by my side casually, but I knew there was little point.  If they knew everything, I wasn\u2019t going to be able to hide anything.  I just had to try and be fast, get some kind of message out to people that could help Rachel before they got to me.\n\nI opened the camera on the phone as I re-entered the surveillance room and hit record.  It made a small beeping noise and once I was sure it was recording, I turned the camera on myself.\n\n\u201cMy name\u2026my name is Tommy.  Thomas Calhoun.  And my job is watching a woman trapped in a room.  This is not a joke or a movie or\u2026whatever.  This is real.  For three years my job is to sit in this room\u2026\u201d  I moved the camera slowly around the room, taking in the door to the bathroom, the water cooler, the desk with the monitors, keyboard, and button box, \u201c\u2026and watch a video feed of a woman locked up in a bedroom somewhere.\u201d  I stepped closer to the desk and made sure the monitor showing Rachel was clear and in focus.  \u201cI didn\u2019t know this woman was a prisoner at first\u2026or I tricked myself into thinking she wasn\u2019t because the money was good.  Either way, I know she is now.  She is in danger and so am I.\u201d\n\nAfter lingering on video of her for a few more seconds to make sure every detail could be seen, I turned the camera back on myself.  I had to hurry, or the video might be too big to send quickly.  I was trying to stay calm, but I felt myself tearing up as I went on, and I did my best to keep my words clear.  \u201cPlease help her.  I don\u2019t know where she is.  I don\u2019t know who has her, because I don\u2019t know who I really work for.  But they are bad people and she is not safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll I know is that I work at a building at [redacted] right outside of San Antonio.  (Per Nosleep rules, to be clear this address is not real.) I only know the names of two other people connected to this place.  The man who hired me, Mr. Solomon.  And a man who might have a job like mine\u2026Charlie Jeffers\u2026no, Jefferies I think.  I don\u2019t know if they are real people\u2026I mean, I don\u2019t know if that is their real names.  Please.  I\u2019m not crazy.  I know how this sounds.  Just come here, see the room.  Figure out where she is and help her.  And\u2026\u201d\n\nI heard the muffled sound of the outer door opening into the locker room and I frantically fumbled with the phone to stop the recording.  How do I send?  Oh no, how do I\u2026there it is.  I hit the button to share, and felt a new panic rising.  Who should I send it to?  I had only a handful of contacts, and I just selected them all.  Maybe at least one of them would take it seriously and get help.  As I heard the door to the surveillance room opening behind me, I hit send.\n\n**Not connected to data service or WiFi.  Please send again when connected.**\n\n*What?  No no no no\u2026*\n\nI turned to see Mr. Solomon entering the room.  He was flanked by two large men in dark suits that looked like bodyguards or something.  Raising a finger, he wagged it at me.  \n\n\u201cNo service in here, Thomas.  But then you should never need service in here, so long as you followed the rules.\u201d\n\n****\n\nThey took me easily.  I tried to make it to the bathroom and close the door, but the two guards stopped me and pulled me down.  They put the\u2026what do you call them?  Zipties on my hands and feet and pulled a black bag over my head.  Then I was being carried out of the room and it felt like they must have put me in the back of a van that was pulled right up to the building.  I was laying on what felt like thin, weird smelling carpet that covered a hard metal layer underneath.\n\nI heard someone get into the van with me, and I asked where we were going.  If they would just take me and let Rachel go.  There was a short laugh overhead and then Mr. Solomon\u2019s voice as he told me that he would explain everything when we got where we were going.  For now, he said, I needed to relax.  It was a long drive and I would need the rest.  \n\nI went to say more, but then I felt a sharp pain in my neck.  They had stabbed me, or\u2026no, they injected me with something.  I was feeling so strange now, but I had to stay awake.  I had to try and get away, I had to\u2026\n\n****\n\n\u201cHello again, Thomas.\u201d\n\nI blinked as I began looking around.  My mouth was dry and my head hurt, but otherwise I felt okay.  I wasn\u2019t tied up any more--Instead I was laying back on a padded table like I\u2019d seen when I went to the doctor.\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t a doctor\u2019s office.  The room was large, and aside from the padded table, it held a small bed, a desk with a computer monitor on it, and a couple of chairs.  Sitting in one of those chairs was Mr. Solomon.\n\nI raised up slowly, blinking at him.  \u201cWhere is she?  Is Rachel okay?\u201d\n\nThe man smiled.  \u201cYou really are something, Thomas.  Trying to be the hero, even if you don\u2019t quite know how.  I respect that.\u201d  Licking his lips, he leaned forward slightly.  \u201cIn fact, I respect that so much that I\u2019ve decided to start our new relationship with as much honesty as I\u2019m allowed.  Some of my colleagues disagree with this approach, but you know what?  Fuck them.  This is my project, and I think you deserve to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d  Looking more serious, he stood up, lifting the gun he had been holding casually in his lap.  \u201cBut before we get into the details, would you like to see Rachel?\u201d\n\nI slid off the table and nodded as I caught myself from falling.  My legs were still wobbly from whatever they had given me, but I barely noticed.  \u201cYes, please.  Let me see her.  The real her.\u201d\n\nMr. Solomon gave a small laugh and gestured toward a nearby door.  \u201cYes, reality is always best.  She\u2019s just there in the next room.\u201d  \n\nI stumbled my way forward, my legs getting better as I walked, and when I grabbed the doorknob, it turned easily.  I expected the door to lead to her bedroom, but instead it opened into another room a lot like the one I had been in, though the stuff in it was different.  Strange machines filled the walls, and in the back of the room was a large\u2026aquarium?  I didn\u2019t know.  It was a big cylinder taller than I was, and it was filled with some kind of gray liquid.   There was a shape in that liquid,\n\n\u201cGo ahead, Thomas.  Feel free to go have a good look.  You\u2019ve earned it.\u201d  I felt my stomach clenching tighter at Mr. Solomon\u2019s words and the meanness in them.  My legs felt heavy again now, but it wasn\u2019t from the drugs this time.\n\nShuffling forward, I could see the shape was a person.  *Oh no*  Or at least a body, because it was clear from just looking at it that the person was dead.  It was very well-preserved, but I could see how the skin hung wrong and looked bloated in spots.  *Oh God, no no no*  Its hair, which had been floating like seaweed in front of its face, drifted away as I reached the glass, and I could see Rachel staring out at me.\n\n\u201cMurderer!\u201d  I turned on Solomon and started to run toward him when he shot me.  Suddenly I was on the ground convulsing as he stepped closer.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Thomas.  It won\u2019t kill you.  Just make you unable to move much for a bit.\u201d  I heard more footfalls as my body began to still.  \u201cGet him up, take him back to the other room.\u201d\n\nI could barely feel anything as I was carried back to the padded table and propped up into a sitting position.  This time I was strapped down, but I guessed it was more so I didn\u2019t fall off, because I couldn\u2019t move anything other than my head, and even that just a little.  I could hardly see at all for crying, but I recognized the blurry shape of Solomon sitting back down in front of me.\n\n\u201cBefore you ask\u2026well, when you are able to ask anything again, yes, that is Rachel.  Not a fake Rachel, not a dummy, and not some kind of trick.  As I said, the time for tricks is past.  Now is the time for truth.\u201d\n\nFrowning slightly, he went on.  \u201cThomas, I understand that showing you that, showing you her body that way, might seem very cruel.  You may hate me for it right now.  I would understand it if you did.  But you called me a murderer, and at least in this specific context, I think that is unfair, because I didn\u2019t kill Rachel.  In truth, I\u2019ve been with this aspect of the project for only seven years.\u201d\n\nHe gestured back to the door behind him.  \u201cAnd Rachel has been dead for over eight.\u201d\n\nI felt my eyes widen as though they belonged to someone else\u2019s body.  It was more lies.  More tricks.  All of it.  Oh God, it had to be.\n\n\u201cDo you know what remote viewing is?\u201d  He rolled his eyes.  \u201cSorry, right, you can\u2019t talk right now.  I\u2019ll just assume you don\u2019t.  Remote viewing is a broad term for the ability to see things that are far away from you physically, to know things you shouldn\u2019t be able to know through your normal five senses.  Some describe it as a psychic ability, though there are several schools of thought as to how and why it works.\u201d\n\nHis eyes fixed on mine intently.  \u201cBecause it does work, Thomas.  Various governments and private organizations have studied it for a very long time, and while publicly it is always ridiculed as pseudoscience and foolish superstition, the reality is that some people have the innate ability\u2026that means it comes naturally\u2026to somehow see other places.\u201d\n\n\u201cRachel was one of those people.  She came into the program when she was seventeen, having been identified via a front-facing screening process that was ran as a psychological test that paid subjects well at a time when Rachel was looking to make some money.  Three months after being identified as a good candidate, she was taken, and after the initial adjustment period, she became a largely compliant asset that quickly rose to the top of our talent pool.\u201d\n\nSolomon folded his hands on his knee.  \u201cI know you cared for her, Thomas, so I think this is worth sharing.  Rachel was never treated badly, other than her confinement and the occasional test that was mildly unpleasant.  No, we all treasured her.  She was enormously talented, not just as a remote viewer, but as an artist.  That\u2019s how she would convey what she saw, you understand.  She would enter into an almost trancelike state when she painted, and when she was done, she would have given us a painting of images and words that provided\u2026well, it was very valuable information.\u201d  He chuckled.  \u201cIf you ever wondered, that\u2019s why there was always such care that the paintings were never shown to the camera.\u201d\n\nPicking at his pants, he went on.  \u201cRachel was so talented, that she was selected for a new program that we thought might greatly enhance or alter her ability.  We introduced something\u2026foreign\u2026into her body.  At first, nothing seemed to change.  If anything, the accuracy of her remote viewing was declining, which was a problem for us and for her.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut then we realized that we were reading the new paintings wrong.  She was able to see more clearly than ever--she just was no longer bound to only current events.  Now her sight transcended time.\u201d  He paused, and I realized he was enjoying telling the story.  The bastard was having a good time, pausing to make it more dramatic.  I would fucking kill him.  \u201cWhile this made some of her paintings less immediately useful, they became much more valuable as we were able to decipher them.  For a time, it looked as though everything was working better than we had ever hoped.\u201d\n\nHis lips thinned.  \u201cAnd then, one day, she showed a painting to the camera.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt said, \u2018Please help me Thomas\u2019.  This immediately sent up all kinds of red flags.  She knew not to show paintings to the camera, and now she was trying to communicate with someone?  We didn\u2019t disrupt her routine, but an intensive investigation began into who she was talking to.  Was it one of her handlers?  One of the technicians?  Someone from her past life?  But nothing checked out.\u201d\n\nLeaning back in his chair, a look of pride grew on Solomon\u2019s face as he continued.  \u201cI was the one that first suggested the idea that she was, intentionally or not, knowingly or not, seeing and talking to someone in the future.  I was still an outside consultant at the time, but by that point we had more strange behaviors from her, including the second message painting, \u2018That girl isn\u2019t me\u2019.  My theory made some sense, but it very quickly ran into a greater obstacle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe introduction of the foreign material had not been as seamless as we had hoped, despite her having been stable for almost three years since it was implanted.  Whether it was due to her increasing emotional upset and stress, or simply the passage of time, she suddenly began to deteriorate.  Her work became more erratic and hard to understand as her body began to decline.  We were monitoring her health closely, but it didn\u2019t matter.  Five days after she painted \u2018That girl isn\u2019t me\u2019, she suddenly went into cardiac arrest and died.  Somewhat inexplicably, we were unable to resuscitate her.\u201d\n\nThe man sighed.  \u201cThis was a great loss.  And it required adjustments of my theory.  Based on everything we knew, it still made sense that she was talking to someone.  Someone with access to the camera feed, and very likely someone named Thomas.  If Thomas was viewing that camera footage in the future, as I believed, then he must be working for us in the future.\u201d  He gave me a thin smile.  \u201cAnd whether you believe that the future is set in stone or not, I\u2019m all for giving it a helping hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeven years ago I began the Thomas Project.  Over the course of that time I have overseen the screening and hiring of forty-three men named Thomas at several different sites, all with one very specific job.  To watch the videos of Rachel from just before her implant to the time of her death.\u201d\n\nI tried to speak, but my mouth still wouldn\u2019t work.  I wanted to say he was lying, that it didn\u2019t make sense, that it *was* another trick\u2026but I think I wanted to hear it more for myself.  Because I didn\u2019t think he was lying.  I didn\u2019t think it was a trick.  And I thought I was starting to understand.\n\n\u201cThe point wasn\u2019t really them watching the videos, of course.  It was how they *reacted* to watching the videos.  What they did, and how that matched up with what Rachel had done in response in the past.\u201d\n\n\u201cThirteen percent quit after the first day.  Thirty-eight percent hit either the red or the green button after the first message asking for help and saying their name.  Twenty-two percent attempted to contact the authorities before reaching the stage where \u2018Melanie\u2019 was introduced.\u201d  He shook his head slightly.  \u201cI wish I could take credit for her introduction, but it wasn\u2019t my suggestion.  We assumed from the \u2018that girl isn\u2019t me\u2019 message that there was a double of Rachel introduced to you at some point, perhaps to kill you or dissuade you or find out what you knew.  But it took a few tries until we felt it was well-refined, and as I\u2019ve pointed out, only twenty-seven percent made it that far.  And all of them failed the next test.\u201d  He pointed at me.\n\n\u201cHer name.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see, the girl you\u2019ve been watching, that talented, wonderful girl whose body is preserved in the next room?  Her name was Rachel Donovan.  I had always wondered if Rachel was merely seeing you, or if there was some kind of connection between the two of you.  When you called \u2018Melanie\u2019 Rachel, I knew that we had finally found the right Thomas--the distant point of light that our Rachel was looking at across space and time.\u201d\n\nI swallowed thickly and found I could feel my tongue, if only a little.  Slurring badly, I pushed out a single word.\n\n\u201cW-why?\u201d\n\nSolomon looked surprised.  \u201cI\u2019d have thought that\u2019d be clear by now.  You\u2019re our only remaining link to one of our greatest treasures.  Perhaps you have a similar ability, or it may be that she forged the link purely though her own talent and will.  But either way, you are important and you have more work to do.\u201d  He stood up and moved over to the table where he turned on the monitor.  As it came to life, I saw it was a frozen image of Rachel\u2019s room--a tape paused where I had left off watching.  Turning back to me, the man looked solemn.\n\n[\u201cYou have to watch the rest of it.  Because Rachel painted you more pictures before she died, and we have to know what they mean.\u201d](https:\/\/redd.it\/9ndww5)\n\n**** \n\n[Final Part](https:\/\/redd.it\/bue2kk)"},"270":{"title":"They told me I was nothing but a dog","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/a1xyn9\/they_told_me_i_was_nothing_but_a_dog\/","flair":null,"author":"Dopabeane","selftext":"My father named me Laika because when I was born, my grandfather told him to treat me like a bad dog. To Father, *Laika* was synonymous with *dog*. He used the name to remind me of my place in the hierarchy: lesser. Beneath. Inferior.\n\nNothing but a dog. \n\nMy father meant to humiliate and degrade me with such a name, but he honored me instead.\n\nYou see, Laika was a stray dog from Moscow. On 3 November 1957, the Soviet Union put her on Sputnik 2 and launched her into space. She was the very first animal to orbit Earth.\n\nThe Soviets knew how to put a rocket into space, but they didn\u2019t know how to bring it back. This made Laika\u2019s mission a death sentence. Shortly after reaching orbit, the interior of Sputnik 2 became catastrophically hot \u2013 far too hot for mammals to tolerate. Mere hours after launch, Laika died an agonizing death. She perished the same way she\u2019d lived: lesser, beneath, inferior. Abandoned. Unloved.\n\nNothing but a dog.\n\nI spent many hours imagining her terror, pain, and loneliness. How would it feel, spending my last hours hurtling through divine darkness in a metal bucket?\n\nWhat must it be like to not understand what I was seeing, or why it was suddenly so loud and so hot?\n\nWhat must it be like to not understand why \u2013 after being plucked from cruel streets and dropped into a bustling world of kindness \u2013 I was now alone? Perhaps I would think I\u2019d been a bad dog. Perhaps I\u2019d think this was my punishment.\n\nPunishment is my mother tongue. I know what it was like to be punished for transgressions I cannot remember or understand, to be hurt so badly my heart rate triples and my mind flies out the window and soars into the stars, retracing Laika\u2019s doomed flight while my husk squirms and weeps on the floor of a dirty house sixty-eight miles below. \n\nEven so, I adapted to punishment. As I said, it eventually becomes a language. Given enough time, anyone can learn a language.\n\nWhat I could not adapt to was fear. \n\nAs a child, I was afraid of everything. You see, in the deepest, most forgotten parts of the world, there are things that most people cannot believe and even fewer would understand. Old ways, old things, old truths. \n\nAnd old monsters.\n\nMonsters like my father and my grandfather. \n\nHow can I describe this in a way you will believe? Maybe I can\u2019t. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t try. So instead, I will describe my grandfather.\n\nHe was called Paval. By the time I turned nine, he had gone through six bodies. By this, I mean he inhabited them. Using a variant of blood magic perfected by my forebears across many centuries, he leapt from body to body.\n\nHe was not a spirit; he had a corporeal body of his own, a twisted, monstrous thing covered in scars and hard, glittering skin, a body that could shrink to the size of a garden snake or expand to the size of a house.\n\nBut for all its marvels, this body was weak; sunlight burnt its eyes and blistered its flesh. So it entered other bodies, like a hand inside a puppet, and wore them until they rotted away. I will never forget the sight of him \u2013 of many hims \u2013 in different bodies as flesh degraded and fell away in wet, discolored strings. Or the way his eyes \u2013 hard, round yellow eyes \u2013 glinted deep within their stolen sockets.\n\nGrandfather preferred the bodies of men, but sometimes chose women or children. Once, he even wore the body of my mother. I was very young then \u2013 perhaps three \u2013 and the sight of her familiar form standing before the fire sent me into such transports of joy that I bawled from sheer ecstasy.\n\nThen she turned around, and in her bruised sockets I saw my grandfather\u2019s eyes: flat, glittering yellow. Like rotted gold.\n\nI reared back, screaming.\n\nMy father, who had been stroking a pair of old baby shoes, looked at me with contempt so deep it scorched my heart. \u201cShut up, dog!\u201d\n\nI cringed. This was a mistake; his contempt exploded into disgust. He shot out of his chair and stomped upon me. Dirty, squirmy pain exploded across my abdomen. I hobbled away, whimpering, and hid under the stairs.\n\nI lay there alone for many hours. Eventually my mind left my body and soared into the sky, a reverse dive into a sea of stars. I drifted away, dreaming of diamond-colored constellations and red nebulae. At my side was a curly-tailed dog with a striped face. My namesake. \n\nLaika.\n\nWhen I woke, I *felt* her: furry and warm, chest rising and falling under my hand. I opened my eyes. For just an instant I saw her in the shadows. Then she shrank away, sinking into the ground. I tried to grab her, but the floor swallowed her. My fingers closed on cold, hard floorboards. \n\nI covered my eyes and wept.\n\nSeveral months later, Grandfather-Within-Mother gave birth to a child. A baby boy with yellow eyes and my father\u2019s curly black hair. Mere minutes after the birth, Father picked up the baby and took him outside. He returned an hour later, empty-handed.\n\nSpurred by horror, I immediately ran out into the night. The cold was brutal, at once invigorating and exhausting. I searched until I found the baby, whimpering weakly beside a snowdrift. He was still covered in birth blood.\n\nI named him Alexander and brought him home.\n\nWhen I walked in, Father immediately slapped me. I reeled back as stars rocketed across my vision. \u201cNever,\u201d he hissed, contempt dripping from every syllable, \u201cnever disobey again. Give him to me now.\u201d He reached for Alexander, but Grandfather stopped him.\n\nI looked up, and swallowed a whimper. Grandfather stared back at me through my mother\u2019s rotting face. The mouth \u2013 puffy and discolored, with an oddly detached look \u2013 quirked into a smile. \u201cNo. Let the dog keep her pup. We have other concerns.\u201d \n\nThey certainly did; they worked together, and they worked constantly. Father kidnapped victims, and Grandfather used them. Whenever Father brought a new victim to the cabin, Grandfather used his hands \u2013 long, hideous things marked with scars and covered in strange, glittering flesh \u2013 to tear out the victim\u2019s tongue and crush their feet. \n\nThen he would wait until nightfall \u2013 because remember, sunlight burned Grandfather\u2019s eyes and blistered his skin - and carry them to his Chapel.\n\nHis Chapel was an ancient stone structure at the base of a wooded hill. Within the chapel were three red windows and six rough-hewn pews. At the end of each pew sat desiccated corpses, facing the altar like sentries.\n\nI hated Grandfather\u2019s chapel; the very air weighed upon me whenever I entered, crushing my heart and poisoning my lungs. The worst part was the fear: electric and paralyzing, inescapable.\n\nLuckily, I was just a dog, and dogs do not spend much time inside chapels. But dogs hear screams. Even screams from far away, echoing down forested mountains long into the night. \n\nGrandfather did not often leave his Chapel, but when he did it was always in the wee hours of the morning. I know this because my father and I were required to hold vigil until he walked through our door. Whenever Grandfather came back from his Chapel, he looked human again: smooth skin, wide smile, good proportions. Sometimes he looked a bit like Father. Sometimes he looked like his victim.\n\nIt was as incomprehensible to me as outer space would have been to Laika. \n\nThe stream of Grandfather\u2019s victims never ended. Vagrants, the elderly, the travelers, orphans fleeing violence. There were so many.\n\nSo, so many.\n\nIf it weren\u2019t for Alexander, I would have withered into nothing. He was more than a brother to me; for all intents and purposes, he was my son. Neither Father nor Grandfather cared for him. They didn\u2019t even feed or clothe him; I had to feed and dress him with what little I had. \n\nDespite my best efforts, he never learned to speak. That isn\u2019t to say he couldn\u2019t communicate \u2013 he could, with gestures and facial expressions and nonsense syllables \u2013 but language eluded him. But it was all right. He grew into a sweet, curious boy with freckles and long, delicate hands. Over time, his terrible yellow eyes mellowed into a clear, bright green. He was my life. He was my heart.\n\nBut he wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nOne night, as a little girl\u2019s screams came shrieking down the mountain from Grandfather\u2019s Chapel, I finally went to my father.\n\nI lay prostrate at his feet, which is how he taught me to approach him. The wooden floor was rough and painfully cold under my fingers. \u201cWhy, Father? Why do you do this?\u201d\n\nHe sat in his chair, watching the fire. In his hands he held a pair of white baby shoes. \u201cBecause your Grandfather and I must live, little dog.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill I have to do this to live?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I don\u2019t want to live.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand,\u201d he said. His grip tightened on the shoes. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d\n\nI choked back a sob and waited for the dismissal; I could not come to him without crawling, and I could not leave until he told me so.\n\nInstead, he said, \u201cStand up, Laika.\u201d\n\nHearing my name was like being doused in ice water. He never used it; by that point, in fact, I\u2019d almost forgotten I had a name.\n\n\u201cI said, stand up, Laika.\u201d\n\nIt was a struggle to obey; fear made my bones rubbery and my muscles weak. \n\nFather held out the baby shoes. \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d\n\n\u201cShoes.\u201d My voice quavered. \u201cOld baby shoes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose shoes,\u201d Father said, \u201cbelonged my sister, Alexandra. I loved her more than anything. More than life. More than my parents. More than your mother. More than you. She was my heart.\u201d\n\nI watched him. The firelight threw his face into relief, creating crevasses out of wrinkles. His curly black hair shifted like smoke, and his long, sharp nose looked strange and monstrous. Paralytic electricity swarmed my skin, so much like the Chapel that I could have wept.\n\n\u201cOn my twelfth birthday,\u201d Father said, \u201cyour grandfather boiled a pot of oil and called Alexandra to him. She and I were going to pick wildflowers later, so she was dressed in her finest clothes: a blue dress and white shoes. These shoes.\u201d \n\nFather did not speak for a very long while.\n\n\u201cShe was my heart,\u201d he finally repeated. \u201cWhen my heart broke, I broke. It made me like Grandfather. Someday, I will be just like him. I will live forever. You will, too.\u201d \n\nThat night, I had a nightmare of a little girl with sunken yellow eyes melting into blisters as my mother\u2019s rotted body doused her with boiling oil. \n\nI woke screaming.\n\nMoonlight streamed through the window, drenching my room in celestial silver. My heart thumped so wildly that I could see my nightshirt moving. It wanted to escape. I wanted it to escape, to, because without it I would die, and when I was dead I could sail the stars with the other Laika.\n\nSmall, warm hands touched my face. I turned, expecting Alexander. Instead I saw my nightmare. \n\nGreat inflamed blisters bubbled and burst, sending rivulets of pus down her tiny, raw face. The skin around its mouth had burned away, leaving neat rows of milk teeth fully exposed. Burned scalp and dull bone glinted through black, curly hair. A blue dress clung to her body. Oil dripped from the hem, soaking my blanket.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d she whispered.\n\nAlexander stirred between us.\n\n\u201cGet out,\u201d I whispered.\n\nThe girl\u2019s blistered chin quivered. \u201cBut you made me come here. Please let me sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I whispered, because I did not know what else to say.\n\nThe girl burrowed under my blanket. I watched, aghast, as she threw a bony, burnt arm across Alexander and drifted to sleep.  \n\nThat night, I did not sail the stars with Laika. Instead I sat awake, watching the apparition with mingled excitement and fear.\n\nJust before dawn, my door creaked open. I tried to shield the girl as my father stepped into the room. \n\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d he asked sharply.\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d I whined. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe girl shifted, and \u2013 incredibly \u2013 began to shrink. Her body flattened into nothing, leaving her dress crumpled on the floor. That sank away, too, leaving the cold, empty floor in its wake.\n\n\u201c*What was that?*\u201d Father screamed.\n\n\u201cI saw it in my sleep \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201c*Her!*\u201d Father roared. \u201c*Her*, not *it*!\u201d\n\n\u201cI s-saw her in my sleep,\u201d I stammered helplessly. \u201cWhen I woke, she was here.\u201d\n\nSweat gleamed on Father\u2019s skin, reminding me of stars. \u201cGet dressed. You must see your grandfather immediately.\u201d\n\nI fell to my hands and knees and crawled to him. \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cStand up. Bring the boy.\u201d\n\nAlexander wept angrily when I picked him up. I ignored him and followed Father into the dark forest. The full glory of early spring bathed the landscape: pale beams of light shafted through the canopy, cutting the thick shadows with gold. Vermin crept through the undergrowth, and deer watched from a distance. The forest was always full of animals; Grandfather was no danger to the birds or beasts, after all.\n\nSoon the Chapel came into view: an ancient little church with a black spire, red windows, and frost-encrusted stones. \n\nFather ushered us inside. The moment I crossed the threshold, my skin began to crawl. Dread and fear swept over me. Alexander burst into tears.\n\nFather shoved me toward the altar. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the sentry corpses twitching. Chests rose and fell in jagged, senseless rhythms. One especially tall corpse with long copper hair turned as I passed.\n\nI covered Alexander\u2019s eyes and stopped at the altar.\n\nShadows thickened and writhed against the back wall. Back in the pews, bones clattered and dried joints creaked.\n\nSomething blinked in the darkness behind the altar: great, flat eyes like golden moons, shining in the cold shadows. \n\nGrandfather.\n\n\u201cThe dog,\u201d Grandfather intoned, \u201cand her pup.\u201d He snarled: a deep, bone-shaking rumble like that of a tiger. Teeth glinted in the shadows, a shining ivory arc wider than Father\u2019s entire head.\n\n\u201cPaval,\u201d Father said urgently. \u201cShe had a nightmare. When she woke, it followed her out of the dream. It came alive. I saw it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Grandfather murmured. \u201c*Oh.*\u201d\n\n\u201cOur little dog has talent after all,\u201d said Father.\n\n\u201cAll good and well,\u201d said Grandfather, \u201c*if* she loves her pup. Do you love your pup, dog?\u201d He reared up from the shadows, twisted and sinewy and utterly inhuman. \u201cDo you love him? Or do you feel *obligated* to him?\u201d\n\nI opened my mouth to answer. Instead, I burst into tears.\n\nGrandfather laughed, a low roar that shook dust from the rafters overhead. \u201cA weak bitch indeed. Our hope is in the boy, Mikhail. It was always in the boy. That is why we made him. Now go.\u201d Those great yellow eyes flicked to the pews. \u201cI do not like to tempt my sentries. Not when they are hungry as they are.\u201d\n\nFear and disbelief battled across Father\u2019s weathered face. \u201cDo you not understand what I\u2019ve told you? She creates life from thoughts.\u201d\n\n\u201cA poor substitute for what we require. Leave, Mikhail.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut \u2013 \u201d\n\nGrandfather rocketed out of the shadows, a rippling mass of glittering skin and malformed limbs, and knocked Father to the stones.\n\nThe corpse-sentries uttered a deep sigh and continued to twitch.\n\n\u201cNever,\u201d Grandfather snarled. Sunlight poured through the crimson windows, imbuing him strange hide with a red glow. He looked like the sky. A starry piece of outer space. \u201cNever defy me.\u201d \n\nI waited breathlessly for Grandfather\u2019s eyes to burst and his skin to sizzle \u2013 he was, after all, exposed to daylight \u2013 but it did not.\n\nMany moments later, Grandfather struck Father across the face and whipped back into the darkness.\n\nWe left. Father did not speak again until the cottage came into sight. Then he grabbed me and dragged me off the path.\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d he growled. \u201cListen well. I can protect you from him. And\u2026\u201d He looked down at Alexander, eyes blazing with disgust. \u201cWhen the time comes, I can protect you from *him*, too.  But only if you help me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy should I need protection? He\u2019s small, and loves me as a mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you remember the story of Alexandra?\u201d Father asked.\n\nI nodded.\n\n\u201cYour story is coming. Only Alexander will be me, and you will be Alexandra.\u201d\n\nMy heart fell to the cold earth. I carefully pressed Alexander\u2019s head into my shoulder, shielding his face from Father. \n\n\u201cListen, dog. When next you dream of my sister \u2013\u201d His voice broke; he pulled away and ran his fingers through his hair. Tears shone in his eyes, which were huge and miserable over his quivering mouth. \u201cWhen she comes again, bring her to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, Father.\u201d I had never seen him weep before; the sight was frightening and curiously thrilling. \u201cI will.\u201d\n\nFather nodded curtly, then left. I nearly followed, but thought better of it. Instead, I stayed in the forest with Alexander.\n\nAs the morning brightened and birdsong swelled to a symphony, I set Alexander upon the narrow path. He ran forward, humming a tune of his own composition. Shadow and sunlight dappled his skin, turning him into a woodland sprite. The trees were in full bloom: petals drifted down like snow, carpeting the earth in glistening white.\n\nAlexander pulled ahead. After a while, I couldn\u2019t hear or see him; he\u2019d drifted away, slipping into the deep shadows.\n\nPanic overtook me. \u201cAlexander! *Alexander!*\u201d I rushed ahead, grimacing against the pain in my chest. My heart thumped wildly, so hard I could see my shirt move; it wanted to escape again. \u201c*Alexander!*\u201d\n\nHe darted from between the trees. I halted, overcome with relief so powerful it took my breath away. Petals covered his head and shoulders. As I watched, one drifted down and settled on his nose. Wide green eyes glimmered above it, bright as the promise of spring.\n\nFor the first time in my life, my heart was so full that I wept.\n \nThat night, Alexandra came to me again, blistered flesh dripping down her face. Her eyes had melted away, leaving raw, swollen masses of flesh in her melted sockets.\n\nRemembering my instructions, I sat up. \u201cFather,\u201d I quavered. Alexandra reached for me blindly, ruined hands closing on shadows. \u201cFather!\u201d\n\nFather burst into my room, gasping. \u201cAlexandra!\u201d He shot forward, arms extended as if to sweep her up.\n\nShe turned.\n\nFather froze.\n\nAlexandra tottered toward him. \u201cMikhail,\u201d she whined. \u201cMikhail, my eyes hurt.\u201d\n\nFather collapsed and covered his eyes as Alexandra approached. She left a trail of pus and oil, shining like a tiny river in the moonlight.\n\n\u201cMikhail, my hands hurt.\u201d\n\nFather wheezed miserably.\n\n\u201cMikhail, my skin is on fire and drips away.\u201d She stopped before him and crouched. Father whimpered and whined like a beaten dog, twisting away from her hands. \n\nShe set her small hand on his cheek. Father squalled and writhed, but couldn\u2019t break away from her. \u201cMikhail,\u201d she wept. \u201cYou are just like him now.\u201d She jerked and began to shrink, to sink, disappearing into the floor. The moment her hand fell away, Father leapt to his feet and ran.\n\nAfter that, he did not ask to see Alexandra.\n\nThis is good, because I did not see her in my dreams after that. I only saw Laika. I spent most nights drifting among the stars with that dear, doomed dog at my side. Imagined or not, the sights were glorious: incomprehensibly beautiful star formations, planets, great multicolored expanses of celestial mists.\n\n\nSometimes I woke, bleary and incoherent, and felt her fur against my skin. But by the time I opened my eyes, there was nothing.\n\nOne winter morning, I woke very early. My stomach growled immediately, and no wonder; Father hadn\u2019t fed me for days. I\u2019d fed Alexander with table scraps and tree bark. \n\nThat, I decided, would change today.\n\nI crept into the kitchen. There wasn\u2019t much; there never was. But I scraped together what little I could, and turned around.\n\nMy grandfather sat at the table, great golden eyes shimmering in his terrible face. \u201cLittle bitch. What have you done to your father? He no longer hunts. He no longer eats. He no longer obeys.\u201d \n\nI felt like I was back in his chapel: crushed by darkness, heavy with dread, on the verge of panic.\n\n\u201cYour ability,\u201d said Grandfather, \u201chas not been seen on this earth for a thousand years or more.\u201d\n\nOf course the ability wasn\u2019t of earth; I\u2019d no doubt come across it while sailing through space and breathing stardust. \u201cIt\u2019s just nightmares.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. You take the dark things of the world \u2013 the fear, the hate, the pain - and channel them into physical form. And that is just the beginning. You will be able to do anything. You will make bodies. Permanent, perfect bodies for me\u2026and for you.\u201d\n\nThe relish in his voice made me sick.\n\nHe said, \u201cOur women have always been weak and talentless. I thought the same of you, little bitch.\u201d\n\nTears pricked my eyes and my bones thrummed as if struggling to break through flesh and run away. But it was no use; destiny had already bloomed between my grandfather and I, heavy and foul with the promise of despair. \n\nGrandfather whispered, \u201cListen closely, for you will only hear this once: *I was wrong.*\u201d\n\nHe left. I ran to the window and watched him hurtle through the trees as sunrise threatened. Back to his Chapel. \n\nI waited until the sun was up. Then I ran to my room, bundled Alexander in every bit of clothing I could find, and left.\n\nWe followed the path for many miles. Our home was hours and hours from the nearest town; we wouldn\u2019t reach it until long past nightfall. I could only hope that Grandfather wouldn\u2019t notice our absence until the following day. It wasn\u2019t an unlikely hope; Grandfather spent most of his time in the Chapel.\n\nThe second this thought crossed my mind, a glittering dark shape leapt out of the trees and knocked Alexander from my arms.\n\nI caught a blur of twisted limbs and nightmarish hands, of great yellow eyes like flattened moons. Alexander screamed as a torrent of blood splattered across the snow. It sank quickly, melting red canyons through the pristine white.\n\nGrandfather at me, narrow sides heaving. Then he leaned down and tore out Alexander\u2019s throat.\n\nI screamed. Birds took flight and mammals ran through the undergrowth. The piercing note echoed off the mountains. The pain within it should have ended the world, but there was no one to hear and no one to care.\n\nGrandfather grinned. Alexander\u2019s blood and sinews clung to his teeth.\n\nI broke. \n\nI felt it; the crushing weight of sorrow, the almost physical sensation of my spirit tearing and bleeding out into my guts.\n\nI fell to my knees and cradled Alexander\u2019s head for hours.\n\nMy father finally found us around nightfall. He had a heel of bread and an oily chicken leg. He pressed them both into my hands, then left. \n\nI tore the bread into pieces and dropped them, one by one, into Alexander\u2019s mouth. When he did not wake, I burst into tears and hurled the chicken leg into the woods.\n\nThe moon rose into the cruel, dark sky. Stars glimmered through the bare branches over head, creating a breathtaking fractal pattern.\n\nI flopped down beside Alexander, pulling him to my body. He was cold. Terribly cold. I held him anyway, keeping my eyes trained on the stars. My mind detached with great difficulty, like it was trapped in tar.\n\nFinally, it wrenched itself free and sailed upward, disappearing into a silvery sea of sky and stars, rocketing ever higher until I saw the Earth spinning below.\n\nLaika\u2019s rocket zoomed past. I reached out and caught one of the metal bars near the nose. I could sense Laika within: her terror vibrated through the craft and leached into my bloodstream.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Laika. I\u2019m here. When you land, I will help you out and we will play together.\u201d\n\nHer fear diminished, and so did her pain. So did mine. Together we sailed the stars, looking upon the Earth and marveling at the incomprehensible beauty around us.\n\nI woke cold, sore, and in more pain than I can describe.\n\nI sat up. Alexander\u2019s stiff body broke away from mine. I reached for him blindly. A thin scrim of ice covered his eyes. The wound in his throat was an open horror, one I couldn\u2019t look at for long.\n\nI drew my knees to my chin and wept. \n\nAfter a while, something warm bumped my hand. A wet nose touched my palm. I knew what I would see long before I opened my eyes.\n\nLaika\u2019s striped face and dear curly tail made me smile, even through my tears. Stars glimmered through her fur, gently pulsing pinpricks of light.\n\n \u201cWhat is this?\u201d Grandfather\u2019s voice echoed through the trees.\n\nRage flowed through my blood, exquisitely corrosive. Hate, I learned then, is pleasurable; it is fury and it is the basis of power. \n\nGrandfather erupted from the darkness, scaled skin shimmering like a river under the moon. \u201cYou waste your talent,\u201d he sneered, \u201con a mutt. Not even your own pup! No matter. I will correct you.\u201d\n\nLaika reared up and leapt, snout piercing one of Grandfather\u2019s flat moon eyes. He screamed and shook his head back and forth. Laika fell to the snow, twisting, and quickly righted herself. Then she bit his foot. Her teeth sank through that impenetrable, immortal hide like butter. \n\nLaika was not large enough or strong enough to kill him, but she tore holes in him the way a match scorches holes in paper. Soon Grandfather was on his knees, mere feet from Alexander\u2019s corpse.\n\nLaika came to me, panting, and collapsed in my lap. She bled from a thousand wounds: some small, some undoubtedly mortal.\n\n\u201cGood dog.\u201d My voice broke. I stroked her gently, willing those wounds to close. I was a monster. I\u2019d used Laika just like the others had; calling her down on false pretenses, filling her with hope, before throwing her into the void. \u201cGood girl. Good, good girl.\u201d\n\nI looked up as Grandfather\u2019s good eye slid to my dead brother. Something dark bloomed there: a wicked, corrupted hope. He curled in on himself, twisted body shrinking to a withered husk, and slid down Alexander\u2019s throat. \n\nI screamed as Alexander\u2019s body twitched and juddered. Then he sat up, bones creaking and frozen sinews cracking.\n\nHe smiled. His eyes shone like molten gold in a forge. \n\nLaika attacked again. Alexander\u2019s face curled into a snarl as she bit and tore his skin, exhibiting an energy at odds with her awful wounds.\n\nI watched, helpless and hopeless and hurting, wishing I could detach and fly into the stars once more. Except there would be nothing there for me now; I\u2019d called Laika down from the stars and doomed her.\n\nThe snow crunched behind me. I whirled around. Father stood there, watching me with contempt. In his hands was a sleek, gleaming shotgun.\n\nRelief and horror engulfed me. This was the end. My mind would detach, forever this time. The fear would finally end.\n\nLaika bit down on Grandfather-within-Alexander, who hit her. She whined, but held fast.\n\nFather stalked past me and cocked the gun.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d I screamed. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt her! *Don\u2019t hurt her!*\u201d\n\nFather pointed the gun at Alexander\u2019s head and fired. Blood and viscera and dark, glittering flesh exploded across the snow.\n\nFather fired again, then reloaded, and fired again and again. Alexander\u2019s head evaporated into red mist. Finally his body lurched, and Grandfather \u2013 small, bleeding, scaled Grandfather \u2013 slithered out of his throat.\n\nLaika caught and held him. Father pressed the barrel of the gun against his good eye and pulled the trigger as the sun broke over the mountains.\n\nFather stepped back. I reached for him, drunk on hope and gratitude, but he recoiled from me. In his weathered face, I saw despair and rage\u2026\n\nAnd contempt.\n\nHe kept his eyes trained on mine as he placed the gun in his mouth.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d I screamed.\n\nHe pulled the trigger. Half his head evaporated, leaving a glistening mass like a fleshy geode. His body stumbled forward a step, then crumpled to the snow. \n\nIt took a very long time for the sun to burn Grandfather down to dirty oil.  Laika held on until the last scrap of skin melted. Then she stumbled to me and collapsed. \n\nI stroked her until her body shrank and sank into the ground, leaving nothing but a scattering of tiny, dim orbs: the stars I\u2019d seen in her fur. I touched one. It was pleasantly hot. I gathered them up and slipped them into my pocket. I went to Alexander\u2019s body \u2013 ravaged beyond description, broken in ways that did not see entirely real \u2013 and sat with him until nightfall. Then I stood and walked away.\n\nAnd life went on.\n\nAt first, I brought them back from my nightmares  \u2013 Alexander, Father, Grandfather, even Alexandra \u2013 but I quickly taught myself to starve and eventually kill my ability. It is not a good power; it is born of rage, despair, selfishness, and fear. \n\nAnd I cannot tolerate fear.\n\nBesides, dogs do not have such awful powers. It is good to be a dog, because they are not necromancers. They are not monsters. They are nothing more or less than the simplest and most loving of creatures.\n\nThat is why I will always be Laika the dog.\n"},"271":{"title":"A Conversation with a Stranger on the Bus","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/beyjh1\/a_conversation_with_a_stranger_on_the_bus\/","flair":null,"author":"flard","selftext":"\u201cHuh?\u201d I asked, pulling off one side of my headphones.\n\n*\u201cI said I like your boots,\u201d* the man repeated.\n\n\u201cOh, thank you.\u201d\n\n*\u201cI had a bunch of pairs exactly like \u2018em for years and years\u2014a good workin boot, ya know?\u201d*\n\n\u201cThey definitely are, I use them every day on the job.\u201d\n\n*\u201cWhere\u2019s that at?\u201d*\n\n\u201cTurner Construction.\u201d\n\n*\u201cAh, yes, yes.

It seemed almost too simple, too easy. But here he was.\n\nDerek had a kindly face, wrinkles around his eyes and cheeks only added to the softness of his expression. His white hair poking out from beneath his flat cap stood out in the dark night.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lovely little patch you\u2019ve planted. I can look after it if you like, I used to maintain the last garden here.\u201d He said, breaking the silence that had followed since his initial words. \n\n\u201cI know who you are. We need you.\u201d Was all I could manage, the mental exhaustion and fatigue from the whole experience had built up, but his arrival was like finishing a bad day working at school. I felt like I could relax again, even if only a little. \n\n\u201cWhats your name darling?\u201d He asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Kat. I live in flat 42 now.\u201d His face lit up as I confirmed my flat number. \n\n\u201cPrudence has gone?\u201d He asked.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s gone. But the whole place is a mess, so many things are happening and the residents are suffering.\u201d I answered. \n\nWe chatted for what felt like hours. Outside with nothing but moonlight. He told me how he used to consider the building part of the garden, a place for him to maintain, the residents just like the plants he looks after. \n\nI explained my whole experience since moving in. I told him about Jamie and I sobbed. Derek held me as I cried and made me feel safe, something I had forgotten the feeling of since receiving Prue\u2019s note. He didn\u2019t interrupt, he just listened.\n\nI told him about Natalia and the cultists, the problems they had been causing. He was particularly heartbroken when he heard that they had used Eddie and Ellie for entry. He had gone before they were born, but remembered Terri as a child and how sweet she was, he was pleased when I told her what a sweet adult she had become. \n\nMy claims that Prudence was the only person who knew how to kill the imposter neighbours were met with a skeptical expression which gave me some hope.\n\nDerek listened to my entire tale with barely a word. When I finished he stood up and asked me to follow him. I was confused, but I did as I was told. \n\nHe walked me to the entrance of the lift. I lifted my arm to check the time on my watch. We had been outside for quite some time and the idea of the creatures being inside made my heart pound and my stomach turn. \n\n\u201cYou are safe. It\u2019s 12.32am, there\u2019s no need to worry or to check your watch.\u201d And with that he pressed the \u201ccall lift\u201d button. Despite his insistence that I was safe my stomach continued to do gymnastics.\n\nIt felt like forever before the lift finally made the clunking sound that meant it had reached the bottom. I felt my whole body shaking violently as the doors opened, I don\u2019t know what I expected to see, we were in the safe time zone but every time I looked at the life I pictured Jamie\u2019s dead, crunched up body. \n\n\u201cStep inside.\u201d He said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t. Please don\u2019t make me.\u201d I begged\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t let anything happen to you. But you need to see something.\u201d There was such sincerity in his eyes as he spoke. I had never trusted someone so completely so quickly, but every fibre of my being told me this man was entirely good. \n\nI stepped inside the lift.\n\nDerek stepped in behind me, placing a comforting hand on my shoulder as I hyperventilated. He gently turned me to face the panel of buttons that control where the lift stops.\n\n\u201cWhat is wrong with this panel? Do you see it?\u201d He asked cryptically. \n\nI studied the panel. Read all the numbers, counting them. I couldn\u2019t see anything wrong. I tried. I really tried, but nothing seemed out of place at all. Everything you expected to find was there and nothing more. I shook my head, barely regaining my composure.\n\n\u201cCan you take us to floor 9 please?\u201d He smiled slightly as he made the request. \n\nI looked back to the panel to press the button, but floor 9 didn\u2019t exist. I was so confused, I had counted the numbers, I was sure of it. Derek must have made it disappear. But the panel didn\u2019t look any different to before. I can\u2019t explain it, looking at it, I would have sworn blind nothing was wrong with it even once I knew, but floor 9 didn\u2019t exist. Derek could see my frustration. It was like the building was now playing tricks on me. \n\nHe walked me out of the lift and sat me down on the bottom of the stairs before he finally began to speak.\n\n\u201cThe building is like a living organism. It can seal off parts of the world, and it can open up others you never could have imagined. When those awful people burned that whole floor of residents I was devastated.\n\n\u201cSome wonderful people lived in those flats, both of the usual and unusual variety. But those people had no limit to their cruelty. Whole families burned alive, it was a tragedy that made me so angry. \n\n\u201cI felt so guilty when it happened. I can predict what some of our more tricky residents are going to do and make sure I\u2019m there to help. But those people were nothing to do with this place. I couldn\u2019t see what they were planning, so I couldn\u2019t stop it.\u201d\n\nAt this point I noticed one of the hairless cats had sat between us, Derek looked at it with tears brimming in his eyes, he stroked it and it moved on to his lap. Dereks fingers didn\u2019t burn at all. He continued.\n\n\u201cWhen it happened the building used its defence mechanisms and sealed off the entirety of the floor. It stopped the fire from spreading and kept the perpetrators there, to die by their own hands.\n\n\u201cThe building only allowed the floor to be unsealed once they were dead. \n\n\u201cIt took about a week before those awful people turned up again. Asking for sugar at people\u2019s doors, the first few let them in. It was so difficult, so many residents burned alive that I was having to use their remains for my garden just to hide the dead. The entire community were terrified and grieving for those that died. \n\n\u201cNo matter how hard I tried I still couldn\u2019t predict them, or see them, so I took Prudence, who at the time seemed a perfectly reasonable woman, to the burned out floor.\n\n\u201cFloor 9, however, had been sealed again. There was no button in the lift, and it always skipped on the stairs. Only no one had noticed. This building really is a magnificent creature.\u201d\n\nI stared at him in amazement through the whole story, I was exhausted but my brain was working in overdrive to process what he was telling me. I had started to stroke the cat too, my fingers did burn, but I didn\u2019t flinch, I found it\u2019s company comforting. He carried on. \n\n\u201cI went back later that night and took the stairs again, alone this time. I think my intentions were clear and the stairs allowed me access to floor 9 for the first time since just after the fire. \n\n\u201cI bought Prudence to the floor within the hour. The stairs had stopped skipping floor 9 for me, although I later learned that when Prudence had tried alone she was not allowed access.\n\n\u201cWe explored the floor, walking amongst the remnants of our dead friends belongings. Eventually, we came across one of the soulless arsonists, roaming the halls. It appears that\u2019s where they spend their time when they aren\u2019t out terrorising the residents trying to claim more victims. \n\n\u201cHe was disturbed and disoriented to see anyone not like them on that floor. He twitched a little and spat out the sugar line as if it was an automatic response, I almost felt sorry for him. He claimed to come from flat 66. More were approaching behind him. \n\n\u201cPrudence was terrified, she was starting to sweat profusely and back away from the man, but it didn\u2019t cool her down, he was burning her slowly. I felt nothing; See, the stranger things in life just don\u2019t seem to affect me, I\u2019ve never known why. Sometimes I even just know how to deal with them, like it\u2019s programmed into me. On this new playing field, in their domain. I knew what to do. \n\n\u201cI grabbed the man and ran him down to flat 66, 4 doors from where we were standing. I threw him into the flat and waited. The other arsonists were approaching.\n\n\u201cThe man tried to exit the flat, that was doorless after the wooden doors all burned to cinders in the fire. But as he reached to door something stopped him. He couldn\u2019t leave, no matter how hard he tried, or how much he screamed. \n\n\u201cPrudence lit up, she grabbed hold of one that had tried to kill her friend, Molly. She remembered the flat number she had claimed to be from and repeated my actions, with a lot more sweating and some winces of pain. It worked again. \n\n\u201cPrudence wanted to go after the rest, but as they got closer I could see the blisters forming on parts of her body, I dragged her out of the hallway and back into the stairwell. We ran. \n\n\u201cShe begged me to take her back, kept telling me that the stairs wouldn\u2019t let her, that it was too dangerous. The residents had started to learn not to let them in and we had no casualties at all after we trapped the first two. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a problem I was intending to deal with, but it was around that time that we first learned the council would be building that monstrosity over the top of my garden.\u201d He gestured to the window that just showed some of the neighbouring tower block.\n\n\u201cThis left me not at my best, my intuition was failing me when a few months after that, I allowed Prudence and Molly to heard the creatures from the lift to floor 9. It\u2019s one of my biggest regrets. I should never have walked them up there. But I didn\u2019t know she was going to burn them all. She didn\u2019t give me a chance to reason. \n\n\u201cI became mistrusting of everyone and distracted. Not long after I went away for a long while. So I guess the arsonists remained and now they\u2019re threatening you.\n\n\u201cTomorrow I will go. I will fix the mess I left behind. I am so sorry it\u2019s affected you so badly, I\u2019d love to meet these twins. They sound incredibly brave.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are.\u201d I finally interrupted, \u201cAnd I want to be there tomorrow. I want to lock Natalia away for good.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t allow it. You\u2019ll be attacked.\u201d He cut me off entirely. I let it drop instantly but in the back of my mind I knew I would be there, no matter what. \n\nI went to sleep that night with my mind reeling. I wondered where Derek slept and if he even needed to. \n\nThe next morning I left my flat early, passed the man on floor 5, and sat at waited on the steps at floor 8. I tested it of course, and just like anticipated, ascending any higher took me straight to floor 10. Or 11 depending on if you hit a skip. So I returned to floor 8, and I waited.\n\nDerek hadn\u2019t indicated what time he was coming. But I was ready. I would wait all day and night if I had to. But luckily I didn\u2019t.\n\nDerek was climbing the stairs at around 11am, I had already been there for 3 hours but it had been worth it. He looked particularly unimpressed to see me. His face still looked kind though, even with the sour expression. \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stop you can I?\u201d He sighed, sounding resigned in his tone. \n\n\u201cNot for anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to promise to stay back. If you get your girl approaches you can do what you need to do, but you have to stay back.\u201d He pleaded.\n\nI nodded and stood up. We ascended the stairs and for the very first time in my new life here I saw the big plastic sign saying 9. The floor that didn\u2019t exist. \n\nAs we pushed through the door it was like entering an entirely new world. Everything was black. Burned to carbon. You could smell nothing but charcoal. Literally nothing but empty shells of homes and flakes of what used to be sentimental objects remained. It was devastating to witness. \n\nIf you\u2019ve ever visited a mass grave site you\u2019ll understand partly how I was feeling. It was sickening, to think of all the lives needlessly lost. But I didn\u2019t get time to think.\n\nNatalia walked towards me. Flying down the hallway. \n\n\u201cHow the fuck did you get here?!\u201d She screamed. Her eyes were wide and angry, I started to feel hotter already. \n\nDerek grabbed my arm and pulled me next to him. Making sure to keep a tight hold of my arm. \n\n\u201cWhere do you live?\u201d Derek asked her, I started to back away as the sweat dropped from my brow. I desperately wanted to shout out the number, but I couldn\u2019t. I was so hot, I wasn\u2019t functioning properly, everything became so overwhelming I couldn\u2019t remember what Georgia had said, what flat Natalia had claimed to come from.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not that stupid. I saw what happened to them.\u201d She gestured over her shoulder to what must have been flat number 66, where a man laid on the floor, breathing but looking broken. Just existing in that room. Prudence had been creative with the truth yet again. She didn\u2019t kill them, you can\u2019t kill them. \n\nWhat had Georgia said? I racked my brains as I felt the skin on my face start to sting. I imagined her melting away, it was happening to me. I was next. \n\nAnd then, as my hair started to singe at the ends, it came to me. \n\n\u201c71!\u201d I screamed as loud as I could. I could barely see as Derek grabbed her and ran towards me with her. She was clawing at his eyes and face screaming at him to let go. But he didn\u2019t burn. He just kept hold of her. When he approached flat 71 he beckoned me over. \n\n\u201cYou do it. Then get off of this floor.\u201d He was blunt but reasonable, I complied. \n\nI pushed hard. There was nothing but anger in her eyes, she pushed my face hard with her hand as I got her to cross the boundary into flat 71. I felt my skin sizzle and blister. My whole face was in agony, but I didn\u2019t stop pushing.\n\nWatching Natalia try to fight her way out of a door that didn\u2019t exist was both satisfying and humorous. The others had started to approach at the sound of the commotion. I lingered, hoping to watch her suffer but derek shot me one look and I knew. It was time to go, \n\nI ran out the corridor and back into the stairwell. I stopped for longer than I probably should have. But I knew I might not get to see that 9 again and it would be worth it. I waited for Derek on floor 9s stairwell. I couldn\u2019t help but imagine the cultists burning to death the first time around. \n\nI could hear angry screams faintly from inside the corridor, they made me worry about Derek but I knew that really I didn\u2019t need to. It took a while, but he eventually left the corridor and joined me in the stairwell. \n\nHe didn\u2019t say anything, he just looked at me and the third degree burns across my face. He didn\u2019t need to speak, I knew he\u2019d fixed the problem. \n\nWe walked silently back down the stairs towards my flat. I looked back up at floor 9, knowing the building would seal it off for good. It took a few floors to reach floor 7 and I invited Derek in for a cup of tea. He rejected it, saying he wanted to go visit some old friends.\n\nDespite my injuries I couldn\u2019t help but smile, something I\u2019d done was going to help these residents. I stood at my door and watched Derek walk away, pleased that there was some true good in this building. \n\nAfter a few steps down the hallway, Derek started to fade, almost like a cgi ghost in a movie, every step he became more transparent. I felt my stomach turn again, like it had outside the lift. I ran out to follow him. I called after him but by the time I had reached where he\u2019d been he was gone. I walked the entire corridor to the window at the back. I looked out the window into the small concrete heavy garden and hoped to see him sat on the memorial bench.\n\nI didn\u2019t see him, instead I saw Prudence. Hacking at my tiny planted patch with shears.\n\nHow it ends: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/cmykhy\/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app"},"273":{"title":"Buying a weighted blanket from Amazon was the worst decision I\u2019ve ever made.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/dv6c4p\/buying_a_weighted_blanket_from_amazon_was_the\/","flair":null,"author":"barkoholic","selftext":"You\u2019ve heard of them. They started as a tool to help calm autistic people and people with anxiety and insomnia. Over the past few years they\u2019ve grown into a popular household item, and with good reason. They\u2019re comforting. \n\nWe\u2019d pay just about anything for some comfort. Do you ever notice how that\u2019s most of what we spend our money on now, us single guys? Why do we constantly crave to be comforted?\n\nMy life wasn\u2019t particularly uncomfortable. Not then. I had finally gotten back track with reality after the disappearance of my wife and kids two years ago. I\u2019d sold our little house in the suburbs, gotten a cheap apartment close to my job, attended all the therapy appointments the police and caseworkers recommended, and gone back to work. I still couldn\u2019t sleep for more than an hour or two a night, even with the medications they gave me, but that was okay. The worst of it was over. Shock and grief can only last so long. \n\nI got one anyway; ordered the thing off Amazon. In queen size, like all my bedding, even though my queen no longer slept in it. \n\nIt arrived ridiculously late. I\u2019m a Prime member, and I selected the free two day shipping. But it at least had gotten there, so I didn\u2019t send a complaint, despite the state it was in after its long journey - not in the familiar smiley cardboard box, but in a shapeless lump haphazardly placed halfway on my front doorstep, halfway in the parking lot. It had been clumsily wrapped in brown paper and tied with a string, and possibly kicked the whole way here, from the look of it. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a quaint, rustic thing,\u201d I announced (to nobody in particular) as I dragged it into my apartment. \u201cA present from grandma, back home, uh, on the ranch!\u201d \n\nBut even talking to myself couldn\u2019t convince me. It looked like a bomb, delivered straight off the set of an action movie. The package was beaten up, stained, and the rough jute string was frayed and nearly falling apart. It looked singed in several places, too. It took me two hours, three gin and tonics, and a hearty microwave dinner to work up enough courage (or suicidal depression) to actually open the thing. \n\nThe blanket was bundled into a poorly-folded cube, held together by another length of the same string that had bound the paper. I wasn\u2019t impressed with its packaging, but the blanket itself looked alright - plush, quilted blue microfiber with thick seams - and felt like it was the right weight. It smelled normal; you know that clean but vaguely chemical-ish odor new blankets have. \n\nI checked the tag, wondering if I ought to clean it, but the ink was smeared and blurry. It seemed risky to throw it in the washing machine without knowing the correct settings to use, so I just threw it over my duvet and went about my business. \n\nAt around midnight I decided to give it a try. I had nothing left to lose; I\u2019d spent hundreds of dollars on my bed over the past few months; the newest and best quality memory-foam adjustable cooling mattress, thousand count Egyptian cotton sheets, customizable-filling pillows, and none of it had brought me a single good night\u2019s sleep. Honestly I expected the same to happen that night, but it was fun to pretend. \n\nI slid between the cool sheets and pulled the blankets up over me. The new blanket was a bit lumpy, but I knew from reading reviews that this was normal due to shipping, and would smooth out over time. The weight was immediately noticeable, and to my surprise, I felt...comforted. \n\nWhen I closed my eyes, I imagined my youngest two had crawled into bed with us, and were laying on top of me, suppressing giggles as they tried not to wake me up. An artfully folded section of the blanket at my back became the familiar bulk of my wife beside me, and when I opened my eyes again it was ten in the morning and I was late for work. \n\nI\u2019ve never been so thrilled to receive a write-up. \n\nThat weird chemical smell didn\u2019t really fade, though, and gradually it became more noticeable. By the end of the week I could smell (or imagined I could) the strange, neutral odor on my skin, even after a shower. By the end of the month, it had become unbearable. \n\nI took it to a dry cleaners, thinking that I\u2019d been lazy because I was so enamored over my renewed relationship with sleep. I was ready for the elderly Korean woman behind the counter to judge me over the stink. I had my excuses rehearsed; work was crazy, I\u2019d had it in my car and forgotten, and I\u2019d had Indian food for lunch and forgotten the leftovers in my car over the weekend, which had amplified the smell. \n\nBut I didn\u2019t have a chance to recite this story. She only waved a handheld metal detector over my blanket and said, \u201cFilling wrong. Can\u2019t clean. Try spray with Fabreeze! You can get on Amazon!\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t imagine what about the filling could be wrong, and I told her so. Sure it was still a bit clumpy from shipping, but Amazon had listed the filler as polypropylene, and all the reviews recommended dry-cleaning. \n\n\u201cMetal,\u201d she explained, then shooed me out the door with twenty pounds of smelly quilt in my arms. \n\nAnother month of beautiful, comfortable sleep went by before I couldn\u2019t live with the smell anymore. People had begun to comment on it at work. Megan, my manager, had tactfully suggested I check my laundry machine to see if maybe a rat had gotten in there and died or something. That was my last straw. \n\nI came home determined to get rid of the blanket and buy a new one. But you know what happens when you lose your entire world, with no answers? You start to cling to things. You hoard them. Because you can\u2019t lose the comfort they bring you. \n\nI tried six dry cleaners before I found one who spoke enough English (through a heavy Boston accent; but you can\u2019t have everything) to explain it to me. \n\n\u201cSometimes they fill these with glass beads,\u201d he said. \u201cThe factories that make the beads, they\u2018ll lose a screw or some metal filings in the batch, and it all goes into the blanket. Machines in factories, you get me? Yeah, so what you can do is cut the seam a little and dump the balls into a bucket or the bathtub or something. Throw the blanket in the wash, hang it up to dry. Then you just pour \u2018em back in and sew it up.\u201d\n\nI told him I didn\u2019t know how to sew. \n\n\u201cYou can get a funnel off Amazon for a few bucks,\u201d he said, and shrugged at me in a particularly apathetic sort of way before turning back to a pile of stained panties. \n\nI did exactly that. They took a week to ship it, which was annoying, but it was a bank holiday that Monday so the delay made sense. \n\nArmed with my funnel and a bucket, I pulled the edge of the blanket over the bed and cut a tiny hole into the seam near the corner. I expected the beads to come pouring out in a clattery flood as soon as I dropped the corner into the bucket. Instead there was a single, loud thump as a lump of something metallic hit the plastic. \n\nI peered into it and saw a gold circle. A wedding ring with a fingerprint carved into it, and an inscription on the inside that I couldn\u2019t see because a chunk of meat and bone were still inside it, but I knew what it said. It said \u201cto love\u2019s eternal glory\u201d. It was my fingerprint on the band. \n\nMy mind went blank and I lost control of my legs, forcing me to sit heavily on the edge of my bed. The motion tugged the blanket over another few inches, and more of the filling came out. This wasn\u2019t a flood, it was more of a...heave, like the blanket was vomiting up pieces of crumbling, dry flesh and bone. Like a cyst being squeezed, thick clumps of horribly recognizable stuff squirted out into the bucket. My oldest son\u2019s teeth clattered loudly against the sides, and I saw flashes of silvery fillings from the cavities caused by gum disease he\u2019d inherited from his mom. \n\nThere was a scrap of almost-bleached-white Hello Kitty band-aid wrapped around a tiny knuckle joint, and I remembered how my daughter had scraped her finger knocking loudly on her brother\u2019s splintered bedroom door, and how she\u2019d smiled through her tears when she saw the special, fun band-aid her daddy had put over the scratch. \n\nI\u2019d been sleeping for two months beneath the heavy weight of a thousand mummified pieces of my wife and children\u2019s bodies. \n\nThe cops couldn\u2019t trace the package, even though they tried. The security cameras in my apartment complex showed an unmarked brown van with no license plate, which dumped the package directly from the window onto my front step. There was nothing to track. \n\nAmazon\u2019s lawyers provided evidence proving they\u2019d packed and shipped the correct (boxed and labeled) blanket. Let me be fair to them; I must say that they offered me a prompt refund. \n\nIn store credit. \n\nBut I won\u2019t be buying anything off Amazon ever again. I\u2019ve gotten rid of my Echo; that was the first thing I threw out, along with all my new bedding, and I canceled my Prime membership. Just for good measure, I threw out my smartphone and smartwatch as well. Amazon and smart technology are convenient and that\u2019s great, but it\u2019s not worth the risk if things like this can happen. \n\nIt\u2019s the only possible explanation, after all - how else could they have found the bodies?"},"274":{"title":"Has anyone heard of the Left\/Right Game?

After all, why would it? I wasn\u2019t a regular contributor to this site, nor a seasoned veteran of the paranormal. I was just a man who missed his friend, seeking a few words of wisdom from an online message board, open to the idea that it wouldn\u2019t lead anywhere.\n \nSuffice to say I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong.\n\nOver the past two months, the incredible advice I\u2019ve received from this forum, and the amazing leads you\u2019ve sent my way, have opened up entire worlds of possibility. It\u2019s thanks to all of you that I\u2019m where I am now; sitting in a rental car on a quiet street in Phoenix, Arizona, posting the last of Alice\u2019s records.\n \nI realise I\u2019ve written more than usual for my part. Apologies for this. If you want to skip straight to Alice\u2019s section, that\u2019s fine.\n \nOtherwise, please consider this the prologue to the epilogue.\n \nIt\u2019s very, very early in the morning over here, with only the gravest of the graveyard shift out on the streets. By all rights I should be in bed, and not wasting petrol on an aimless drive through the city. The ritual helps me think however, and I\u2019d recently been given a lot to think about, courtesy of a young woman at a local bar.\n \nShe was a forum member, who\u2019d contacted me over Direct Message. When we met up earlier in the night, it was clear she\u2019d done a great deal of research; charting every mirror shop in Phoenix in an attempt to reconstruct the route Alice took on February 7th 2017.\n \nWe spoke for quite a while; about the game, about Alice, and about life in general. Once closing time rolled around, she handed me a printout of the most likely route, with all the key locations circled. Then, in the final minutes before we parted ways, she nervously asked me two questions. The first put me in a rather sour mood.  The second provided the fuel for my 3am drive.\n \nQuestion One; Are you sure she wants you to find her?\n \nI\u2019ve been hearing the same query from a few of you recently, especially since Part 9 was posted. People commenting that Alice made a clear choice when she left Rob behind in the silent city. That I was searching for someone who wasn\u2019t seeking return.\n \nI\u2019d like to take a moment to respond to this, as I responded to it earlier tonight. To be clear, the Alice I know wouldn't do that. She was planning to come back, she\u2019d told us as much. I\u2019m not going to waste your time with my theories, but we\u2019ve seen what the road can do to people's minds, how it can carry them away against their better judgement. I understand why it's being asked but if those sorts of questions are all you have to offer, I\u2019d kindly ask you find another way to help.\n \nQuestion Two was less clear cut; what are you going to do now?\n \nIt\u2019s something you guys have also been asking me, but that was the first time I\u2019d heard the question out loud. In the awkward silence that followed it became obvious to her, and in some ways to me, that I didn\u2019t yet have an answer.\n \nI decided to take a drive while I figured it out\u2026 I\u2019ve been in my car for the rest of the night,\n \nAfter an hour of aimless meandering, I realised I was close to one of the marked locations; the alleyway where Alice first entered the underpass, the point at which she first disappeared into the road. Turning into the side street, just after a large intersection, I was briefly relieved to see no sign of the tunnel. The part of me that still hoped this game was a fiction swelled at the sudden lack of evidence. My reaction was short lived of course, as I quickly realised that the tunnel wouldn't have shown itself to me anyway. Even if the game were real, I\u2019d hardly been sticking to the rules on my way here.\n \nThere was no denying that the place resembled Alice\u2019s descriptions however, and with a long time to go until I\u2019d feel remotely tired, I decided to work my way back along the route, retracing Alice\u2019s steps towards Rob Guthard\u2019s street.\n \nOK so I have to admit at this point, I suffered from a momentary lapse in intelligence. In a fog of distraction, residual jetlag and general dullardry, I drove for longer than I\u2019d care to admit under the misconception that I *wasn\u2019t* playing the game. I thought this because I was heading in the opposite direction, and had started my run with a right hand turn, when the rules explicitly state that you begin by turning left. Of course, as I\u2019m sure all of you would have realised immediately, that didn\u2019t mean I was out of the game, it just meant I started playing with my first left turn, one road later.\n \nAlice was always the smart one.\n \nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that, due to this fairly mindless oversight, I wasn\u2019t exactly looking out for the Woman in Grey as I drove past what should have been her corner. There wasn\u2019t a mirror shop this time of course, that\u2019s only the 34th turn when you\u2019re coming the other way, in fact I\u2019m not sure which of the many passing streets it was. It is strange though, as I think back through my journey, I feel like I would have noticed her. The streets were practically deserted, so much so that any pedestrians stood out immediately. I know I should\u2019ve been looking more closely but, if you asked my honest opinion\u2026 I don't think she was there at all.\n \nThe moment I realised this, I felt it again; the faint perverse, hope that I\u2019d been misled, that the entire story was nothing more than a twisted, elaborate fabrication.\n \nIt wasn\u2019t long until I passed an old mirror shop and, 34 turns later, arrived on what must have been Alice\u2019s starting street. It was an inner-city neighbourhood whose residents were all fast asleep. From the moment I realised that the game was in play, I\u2019d been thinking less and less about this particular road, and more about the one directly after it, resting just beyond the crossroads. I\u2019d come halfway across the world on the strength of Alice\u2019s account, but I\u2019d seen no first hand proof of the Left\/Right Game. If the whole thing was a hoax, then the next road should just be another street. If it was real, then I\u2019d know soon enough.\n \nI crawled up to the junction with my heart in my throat. With every inch of road that passed under my tyres, I found myself hoping more and more that it wouldn\u2019t be true. Let someone be playing a prank on me, let the logs be counterfeit... let Alice be anywhere else but on that road.\n \nI took the corner in a wide arc, parking myself in the centre of the crossroads, my headlights facing down the next turn.\n \nAhead of me was a quiet residential street; lines of neatly parked cars, rows of well-kept yards and squarely drawn windows. Yet at its centre, in utter defiance of the modest surroundings, the road sank into a deep and dimly lit corridor, cutting beneath the street, and disappearing into complete darkness.\n \nI\u2019d always known it was true.\n \nIn the presence of grim confirmation, the question I was asked earlier that night started to ring in my ears, as if echoing out of the tunnel itself. After an entire night\u2019s driving, after two full months of searching, I still didn\u2019t have a response.\n \nIn the end I just left the engine running, as if turning it off would somehow be a sign of retreat, and decided to type up the notes you\u2019re reading now. I thought maybe the process of putting it all down on paper would bring me clarity, and leave me with either a note of farewell or a note of apology to Alice, for not having what it took to find her.\n \nAnd now\u2026 here I am; still undecided, still writing, still sitting in this rental car on a quiet street in Phoenix, Arizona.\n \nThough perhaps the street\u2019s not as quiet as I thought.\n \nI\u2019ve just looked back to the previous road, down the street where Alice began her journey. As I type this very paragraph, I can see a figure standing on the sidewalk, just outside one of the houses. It isn\u2019t the woman in grey this time.\n \nThough it\u2019s almost too dark to make out, I can tell the figure is an older male, well built and imposing, the rugged features of his weathered face half lit by moonlight. I\u2019ve never seen this person before, yet he bears a striking resemblance to another man; a man whose description has been well recorded within the pages of Alice\u2019s logs.\n\nHe watches me in silence, staring through the window of my still running car.\n\nI wonder if he can help.\n \n[Part 1](https:\/\/redd.it\/7asz8x)\n \n[Part 2](https:\/\/redd.it\/7bkk41)\n \n[Part 3](https:\/\/redd.it\/7cf4h8)\n \n[Part 4](https:\/\/redd.it\/7dmuvp)\n \n[Part 5](https:\/\/redd.it\/7fdu9c)\n \n[Part 6](https:\/\/redd.it\/7h9jzb)\n \n[Part 7](https:\/\/redd.it\/7jabqd)\n \n[Part 8](https:\/\/redd.it\/7loh1l)\n \n[Part 9](https:\/\/redd.it\/7q3x6e)\n \n*****\n \nThe Left\/Right Game [DRAFT 1] 20\/02\/2017\n \nThe Left\/Right Game was once nothing more than a 9-page document, peeking out of a yellow envelope, resting quietly on my desk.\n \nI remember reading it on my lunch break.\n \nI remember it made me laugh.\n \nThe submission had arrived with the first post, quietly making its way around the office, treated by everyone as a short-lived novelty of little journalistic value. The story was easy to dismiss, appearing all too similar to the rambling ghost stories and blurry UFO sightings that filled our mailbox on a daily basis, and which most of the senior staff had learned to instinctively ignore. Doomed by association, the document was quickly passed over, my desk merely a pit stop on its way to the rejection pile.\n \nI was curious however and, after an uneventful few months in my new role, I had no compunctions about fishing from the scrap heap. Placing the envelope in my satchel, alongside a misfit crowd of similar rejects, I slipped away to a local coffee shop, reading it in an armchair by the window.\n \nSomewhere around page three, between the description of the game\u2019s rules and the exhaustive list of \u201cRequired Skills\u201d, my mouth started to curl into an irrepressible smile.\n \nThey\u2019d been gloriously wrong about this one. It wasn\u2019t some paranoid diatribe, nor a sensationalist plea for attention. Within those pages lay an introductory glimpse of a man\u2019s passionate obsession. As I read on, something about his earnest eccentricity, incredible thoroughness, and unquestioning confidence made it impossible to put down. When I turned the final page, reading the last of Rob Guthard\u2019s charming and refreshingly well formatted submission, I knew that this was the story I wanted to tell.\n \nLater that day, I found myself in the editor\u2019s office making a case for it. They didn\u2019t quite see what I saw, but I was intent to win them over regardless. I told them the story would be characterful, colourful, thought-provoking and, at the very least, that I wouldn\u2019t be gone long.\n \nIt\u2019s been twelve days since then; ten since I first entered the Wrangler in Phoenix, Arizona, five since I commandeered it myself, leaving Rob behind in the silent city. I haven\u2019t updated much recently, save for a regular set of notes made for my own benefit. In all honesty, after I finished writing up my account of the city, I was struck by an overpowering sense of needlessness. There was no one left to receive these logs, no friends to proofread, no editor to hand them to. It seemed pointless to maintain the same prosaic format as before.\n \nI still largely agree with this assessment. It\u2019s only due to a set of exceptional circumstances that I\u2019ve chosen to type up the following account in full.\n \nWhoever this reaches, I want to thank you for reading up to now.\n \nI\u2019m quite sure this will be my final instalment.\n \n*****\n \nThe moon has broken, and in my entire life, I\u2019ve never witnessed an evening so still.\n \nThe air is cool and quiet, and the Wrangler cuts cleanly through it as I glide down a stretch of even tarmac. The scene is defined by calm and absence. Not a cloud in the sky, not a solitary whisper of breeze, not a single blade of grass stirring on the dark green banks beside me.\n \nYet even on a night as peaceful as this, I can\u2019t help but feel far away from home. The city had served as a turning point in that regard. Before we reached those titanic monoliths, the landscapes we passed through generally resembled the world I once knew. A few obvious exceptions aside, there was nothing about the environments that looked truly divorced from reality. That\u2019s all changed now. The aberrant aspects of this new world are unignorable, constantly hanging at the corner of my eye, passively injecting a sense of wonder and disconcertion into the otherwise silent night.\n \nA few days ago the moon started to crack like old porcelain. I hardly noticed at first, my eyes fixed on the road as it loomed above me, quietly splintering into three jagged pieces. As of tonight, the empty space between each fragment has significantly increased. If I focus on the sky for a little while, I can almost see them falling away from each other, charting infinite and lonesome trajectories through a barren cosmos, against a backdrop of foreign constellations.\n \nThe stars themselves fall further than they should. The night sky travels down past the horizon and continues below it, wrapping underneath the grassy bank. It\u2019s as if the road, and the narrow plains on either side, are suspended in the middle of a vast abyss; a platform in the middle of open space.\n \nAt least that\u2019s what I thought it was at first. It didn\u2019t take long before I noticed the broken moon was appearing twice in the sky, both above and below me. A pair of orbiting satellites; identical and in perfect alignment. That\u2019s when I realised that there were no stars below me. I was merely staring across a flat surface so flawlessly mirror-like as to cast a perfect reflection of the heavens above.\n \nI was driving through the centre of a lake.\n \nThe water is impossibly still. Since leaving the shoreline proper yesterday night, I\u2019ve seen neither a wave, nor a ripple across its placid surface. It\u2019s also undeniably vast, reaching beyond the horizon in every direction and continuing further still. Without being sure how I know, I\u2019m aware that the waters carry on for an unspeakable distance, that I would sooner reach the stars themselves before setting foot on its opposite shore.\n \nI lean over and switch gears. The act of driving the Wrangler was a daunting one at first, but after the first two days I\u2019ve managed to make do. An old scarf wrapped tightly around the steering wheel serves as a makeshift handle, allowing me to navigate corners one handed. I don\u2019t have an elegant solution for the gearshift, but I\u2019ve quickly grown used to the process. If I\u2019ve learned anything from the road, it\u2019s that grace is the first casualty in the fight for survival. Adaptability, no matter how clumsy, outlasts it at every turn.\n \nA few minutes later, the Wrangler pulls up to a spacious verge. A large circle of land surrounded entirely by dark waters. At the far end, the grass seems to fall away, dropping sharply into the lake with a dead stop. The road continues of course, but it's the only thing that does. With nothing on either side, it forms a narrow bridge of perfectly flat asphalt, raised on a bed of mud and rock.  \n \nI press my boot onto the brake pedal, easing the Wrangler to a steady halt at the centre of the clearing. For the first time today, I open the car door and climb out of my seat. The dull tap of asphalt shifts to a soft rustling as I make my way over to the lakeside.\n \nThere\u2019s something on the shore, a barely discernible object, almost entirely concealed by a shock of verdant undergrowth. It\u2019s a miracle I\u2019d managed to spy it from the road, though perhaps something about the stark uniformity of the landscape had made it stand out. \n\nAs I advance towards the water, and the object draws near, its indeterminate form solidifies in my mind.\n \nIt\u2019s a human arm, reaching out from the water and onto the bank. I crouch down to examine the few pertinent details. The fingers are still embedded firmly into the soil. The thumbnail is broken, coloured by a peeling coat of faded varnish. There\u2019s a pallid, emaciated quality to the skin, spreading down the arm until it disappears beneath a thick, woollen sleeve. At the point it meets the surface, the water soaks into the fabric, turning it black from the original grey.\n \nWith a sad exhalation, I rise to my feet and lean over the water\u2019s edge.\n \nThe body of Marjorie Guthard lies against the silt, her cheek resting on the lake bed, her wide bewildered eyes staring out into the open lake. She\u2019s been almost perfectly preserved. Save for the striking tautness of her skin and its mottled, grey pallor, she looks exactly like the woman I saw on the 34th turn, who\u2019d tried to repel me from the road, who\u2019d spoken of a lake drinking her wounds clean.\n \nIt seems her ramblings weren\u2019t completely void of fact. It\u2019s clear to see that Marjorie has been exsanguinated, so completely in fact that the only evidence that blood ever flowed through her veins, is a large dark stain across her shredded blouse.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take long before the perpetrator makes itself known.\n \nAs I stare into the water, a steady stream of formless whispers sink up through the depths of the lake. The softly spoken murmurings drift up to my ears, taking root in the back of my mind and instantly blooming into a flurry of deeply persuasive promises.\n \nI find myself entirely transfixed by the still water, as a myriad of generous offerings unfold in throughout my consciousness. The whispers suggest an end to the phantom pains in my absent arm, perhaps even a completely restored limb, stronger than it had been before. Furthermore, it shows me a glimpse of its incomprehensible span, its furthest bank reaching across countless worlds, its deepest point lying below everything. I\u2019m offered total knowledge of every league, every fathom, every inconceivable shore.\n \nMy hand reaches down as the whispers continue, every bargain steeped in sweet beneficence. A moment later, my outstretched fingers brush against the soft grass, and wrap around Marjorie\u2019s exposed arm.\n \nDigging my heels into the ground, I lean myself backwards and pull. The water ripples and splashes as I drag Marjorie\u2019s lifeless body slowly onto the bank. I feel the voices in my mind grow louder, erupting in anger as I back away from the lake.\n \nThe promises had been convincing, each quiet solicitation undeniably persuasive. But after seeing Marjorie\u2019s wretched fate and the look of eternal betrayal in her vacant eyes, I found myself aware of a subtle undercurrent behind every syllable, a sense of desperation and timeless hunger emanating from beneath the lake\u2019s surface. I already have a clear understanding of what would have happened if I\u2019d lost myself to those waters. I suspect it\u2019s no coincidence, that of the countless shores it showed me, all of them appeared to be deserted.\n\nMarjorie wouldn\u2019t have stood a chance. She\u2019d left the forest alone, grievously wounded and without a vehicle. She\u2019d walked the whole way here, bleeding endlessly, the road\u2019s rejuvenating power battling every moment against her body\u2019s natural inclination to die. I suspect the road\u2019s influence wasn\u2019t strong enough, and when a whispering voice promised, ever so sweetly to mend her, she would have been in no position to refuse. \n \nHer other sleeve brushes against dry land, her body leaving the water for the first time in decades. I keep pulling until my boots hit asphalt, laying her down on the grass just beside the Wrangler.\n\nAfter a moment of sober vigil, I walk to the back of the car and fetch Rob\u2019s foldable spade.\n \nA long few hours follow. I\u2019ve never dug someone\u2019s grave before, and my injury is hardly conducive to the task. My fleece tied around my waist, pearls of sweat running down my brow, I manage to slowly chip away at the damp earth. Five hours later, my back cramping, my hand raw from gripping the shovel, I attempt to lower Marjorie into the rough pit with some semblance of grace, her legs dropping limply into the soft soil despite my best efforts.\n\nIt takes over an hour to shovel the soil back. It\u2019s a sobering and ugly task. As a layer of dirt covers her face, I realise this will be the last time a living person lays their eyes on Marjorie Guthard. Burying her suddenly feels disrespectful, as if it\u2019s an act I don\u2019t have the right to perform. \n\nOnce it\u2019s done, I drop onto my knees, a dull ache in my muscles as I smooth out the disturbed ground with the back of the shovel.\n\n**MARJORIE:** You.\n\nEven before I turn to face her, I can hear a scowl in her voice. There\u2019s an odious depth to that one acrid syllable, a potent witch\u2019s brew of contempt and accusation that feels like it\u2019s been festering in her drowned lungs for decades.\n\nReluctantly, I rise to my feet and turn around, finding myself face to face with the woman I just buried. She looks different now, her clothes are dry, her skin clear, with nothing to be seen of the deep, dark gash in her blouse.\n\n**AS:** Marjorie.\n\nUnlike the empty vessel below us, the woman in front of me is by no means at peace. She shakes and wretches with the same indignant fury I witnessed when we first met. When she speaks, her words shudder under the weight of her own turbulent emotions.\n\n**MARJORIE:**  I chased you. I ran to you. I\u2026 I gave him up for you.\n\n**AS:** I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m sorry Marjorie, I don\u2019t know what you mean. Tell me what you mean.\n\n**MARJOIRE** The things I saw, things so beautiful. And I saw her, walking alone through the new worlds. I gave everything up for you!!\n\nI don\u2019t know quite what to say. It\u2019s pointless to ask her what she means, to try and understand her frenetic ramblings. In the end, I can only try to speak her language.\n\n**AS:** Marjorie I\u2026 I didn\u2019t mean you to.\n\nMarjorie\u2019s trembling breaths burst into a despairing fit of laughter.\n\n**MARJORIE:** Oh\u2026 oh yes you did. Yes you did. And now\u2026 now you\u2019re here.\n\nMarjorie\u2019s wild and volatile demeanour shifts once more, her laughter degrading further into a desperate crying panic.\n\n**MARJORIE:** And what do I do now? What- What do I do?!\n\nMarjorie cringes with the terror of the self-imposed question, placing her head in her hands and repeating it over and over again. As I watch her wrestle with despair, I\u2019m struck by an idea I\u2019ve never before considered. The disconcerting notion that, in death, we are not transported to a set destination by some ethereal attendant. That in fact, nothing is decided for us. Perhaps the manner in which we spend our afterlife is down to us, a decision we have to make ourselves.\n\nMarjorie is standing over her own lifeless body, still lost, still entirely unmoored. \n\nThere's no sign of boundless paradise, inescapable damnation or everlasting nothingness, and the common thread they share, a final release from the weight of our own agency, is similarly absent. Perhaps we never get that freedom, perhaps we continue like we always do, accompanied by all our imperfections, uncertainty and discontent. \n\nPerhaps we must choose our eternity.\n\nAfter all my time on the road, that\u2019s possibly the most terrifying notion I\u2019ve encountered. \n\n**AS:** He never stopped looking you know.\n\nMarjorie snaps out of her wretched despair, instantly aware of who I\u2019m referring to, staring up at me with an expression I\u2019ve never seen her wear before. \n\n**AS:** I saw him, walking on the road. He didn\u2019t stop. He was never going to stop. I think he was looking for you Marjorie, he still is. \n\nMarjorie stares through me. For the first time since we met on that quiet Phoenician corner, I can see the faint spark of something other than misery and rage across her tear stained face.\n\nI hold her gaze for a moment more, before pulling my phone from my pocket. In a single sweep of my contacts, I delete every number except for one. A number I pulled from the Nokia during our second night on the road. A number that connects to a lost wanderer of the road.\n\n**AS:** I don\u2019t know if this can help but\u2026 stranger things have happened.\n\nAs she stares up into my eyes, I feel like we\u2019re finally meeting for the first time. Without a word, Marjorie reaches out a quivering hand and takes the phone from my outstretched fingers. \n\nBefore I can say anything more, Marjorie Guthard is gone.\n\nA few moments later, a refreshing breeze lands against my cheek, a soft zephyr, cooling my still warm face. It\u2019s a welcome sensation, and the first movement I\u2019ve witnessed in the air since I set out onto the lake. Wiping the sweat from my forehead, I stare quietly along the bridge, the breeze picking up around me.\n\nIt\u2019s a subtle wind at first, brushing stray hairs across my forehead, chilling the perspiration on my neck. Yet as I reach my hand out, and feel the air slip between my fingers, I\u2019m witness to a steady rise in both strength and magnitude.\n\nThe sound of the wind grows from a whisper to a howl, Seconds later, the hanging sleeves of my fleece begin to stream sideways. My hair lifts from my back, billowing in the throes of a developing gale. \n\nI back up against the Wrangler\u2019s hood as the air finally erupts into a roaring, cacophonous cyclone. My hand reflexively seeks the sturdy frame of the Wrangler, my fingers wrapping around the grille, my arm tensing as the unrelenting wind threatens to drag me from the road.\n\nSquinting through the violent tempest, I focus on a single point in space, just above the threshold of the bridge.  In the midst of the storm, a jagged line of white hot light bursts out of the ether, tearing through the night\u2019s fabric, a crackling fissure that widens and yawns, forcing apart the curtains of reality as they frenetically struggle to recombine. \n\nStaring through the shuddering fracture, I\u2019m subjected to the briefest glimpse of a boundless, and impossible vista. It is a faraway place in both distance and time. An achingly beautiful and gloriously terrifying dreamscape, enduring on the majestic shores of infinity. Every moment there spans a millennium and unfolds in countless directions at once. Every passing shadow holds a darkness beyond measure, their edges burned by the glare of a waking sun which looks across every conceivable world with a hollow, rancorous intent.\n\nIn the midst of this maddening landscape, a singular entity approaches, gliding towards the portal with the clear intent to pass through. As it breaches the shuddering gateway, and the wind dies down around it, I stare up at its grand celestial form.\n\nThe being is unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen; composed entirely from electric arcs of brilliant, magnesic light which burst from a volatile and blinding central core. It sounds like a lightning storm, its plasmatic tendrils snapping and crackling, bursting chaotically through the night air before collapsing in on themselves. As they fall back into the creature\u2019s centre, they emit pale clouds of vaporous fractals that fade softly into the air.\n \nSomehow, even as my eyes barely adjust to the stark light, I realise that the entity usually burns much brighter. It's dampened its glow for my benefit, so that it can appear before me without scorching my eyes from their sockets.\n\n**AS:** It\u2019s you\u2026 isn\u2019t it. You\u2019re the voice I\u2019ve been hearing. You\u2019re the one who brought me here.\n \nThe bristling maelstrom of light hangs in the air, crackling and shifting, its transient limbs strobing with chaotic incandescence. Part of me wants to hide, part of me wants to run, but neither are an option anymore. Releasing my hand from the Wrangler\u2019s grille I take a single step forward, standing on my own and staring up into the entity\u2019s smouldering core.\n\n**AS:** Can I get an interview?\n\nThe creature doesn\u2019t react. In the following silence, I feel it observing me. When it finally responds, its voice ruptures the night, echoing through my skull.\n\n**VOICE:** There is little time, but you may ask what questions you have.\n\nEach reverberating syllable forms a string of literal shockwaves in the surrounding lake, emanating outwards from the being in a perfect circle. I watch the waves roll into the distance, showing no sign of ever diminishing, and I think about what question to ask first.\n\nIn the end, it comes to me quickly; a promise is a promise after all.\n\n**AS:** What happened to Marjorie? Why did she do what she did?\n\nThe being pauses, as if considering its response. When it does reply, it speaks with a calm sobriety.\n\n**VOICE:** She glimpsed an echo of the future, dreamed of the road, of the things that it passes through.\n\n**AS:** Like whatever\u2019s through there?\n\nI gesture through the gateway, which is now almost entirely blocked from view by the creature\u2019s spiralling form.\n\n**VOICE:** She dreamed of untold frontiers. She saw a lone woman walking them. Over time, the fulfilment of that vision became everything to her.\n \n**AS:** But it wasn\u2019t her\u2026 she thought she was seeing her own future\u2026 but it was-\n \n**VOICE:** It was you.\n\nThose three words, as they burst into the open air, casting three narrow waves across the boundless water, hit me with a deep and heavy force. Unbeknownst to myself, decades before I was even born, Marjorie had been driven insane by dreams of maddening grandeur, of a life of boundless possibility and true significance. She had given everything up to chase a shadow\u2026 a shadow that eventually turned out to be mine.\n\nI hadn\u2019t just pulled Rob into this game, I was the reason for everything. I was the cause for the tragedy that befell his entire family, \n \n**AS:** She didn\u2019t just dream those sights. You influenced her. You let her see them\u2026 the same way you made Rob see me in Aokigahara. You pushed and you prodded wherever you needed so that I\u2019d end up here. Are you the reason Bobby got the rules in the first place?\n \n**VOICE:** Yes.\n \n**AS:** But\u2026 why? You toyed with so many lives across\u2026 across decades. Why me? Why does it matter that I travel the road?\n \n**VOICE:** Because across all humanity, across every conceivable permutation, you are the one who makes it the furthest.\n \nIt speaks plainly, as if the statement were a foregone conclusion. Yet its words strike me into silence.\n\nThe creature continues.\n\n**VOICE:** I\u2019ve watched you work your way here, through skill and through tenacity\u2026 and undeniably through luck. You were brought here because of these qualities, and they will carry you further along the road than any other.\n \n**AS:** Then why didn\u2019t you just bring me here? All that influence and you didn\u2019t lift a finger\u2026 after everything that happened-\n \n**VOICE:** Events transpired as they needed to.\n \n**AS:** As they\u2026 needed to?! People died! Marjorie. Bobby. Ace. Apollo. Eve. Lilith. Everyone. They\u2019re all gone. Do you not care at all?\n\nIn response to my words, the entity remains silent for longer than usual.\n \n**VOICE:** I care more than you know. There are things greater than your understanding, forces that exist beyond the realms of your comprehension that you would consider a threat to everything you hold dear. My actions were guided by a higher standard of knowledge. Your protests are predicated on false understanding.\n \n**AS:** You\u2019re saying I don\u2019t understand death?\n \n**VOICE:** You don\u2019t.\n \n**AS:** ... That still doesn\u2019t make it right.\n \n**VOICE:** Regardless, my influence is necessary. That which is necessary must be.\n\n**AS:** What even are you?\n \n**VOICE::** I cannot answer that question in any way you\u2019d understand.\n \n**AS:** That's not good enough.\n\nThe creature doesn\u2019t respond, as if it doesn\u2019t feel it needs to. So far it\u2019s returned my every argument with impenetrable certainty. From the domain it occupies, knowing what it knows, my arguments must seem entirely facile. Even if it did feel the need to justify itself, after seeing the place it hails from, I wonder if there\u2019s any way I could ever comprehend its motives.\n\nStill, that doesn\u2019t mean my arguments are invalid, and the creature\u2019s lofty dispassion does little more than stoke my desire to oppose it.\n\n**AS:** And what if I don\u2019t want any part of this?\n\n**VOICE:** You are travelling the aberrant strand; a singularly stable flaw in the fabric of reality. As it carries you further from the world you know, you will be freed from the influence of the old laws. You have already noticed the effects in those who settled the road, those who were lost to it and in yourself; energy without consumption, knowledge without requisite experience. You are shedding entropy, and causality and in time you will reach realms of understanding you cannot currently fathom. You will find answers to questions you never thought to ask. You will discover absolute truth. For this reason, you will carry on.\n\n**AS:** That\u2019s the only reason?\n\n**VOICE:** Do you need another?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t come across as a question, but rather another blunt statement of fact. I understand the effect it\u2019s speaking of. Ever since the city, I\u2019ve been encountering vague notions and fragmented ideas that occur to me randomly and without announcement. New avenues of thought leading to revelations that would otherwise lie beyond my mortal reach.\n\nI\u2019ve started to comprehend things I could barely have conceived of back home, and though the onset of these notions had been terrifying at first, they grow less so with every passing day.\n\n**AS:** No\u2026 no, I don\u2019t trust you. I don\u2019t-\n\n**VOICE:** Your trust is immaterial. You will travel the road regardless.\n\nThe creature\u2019s already stark glow starts to intensify.\n \n**VOICE:** I\u2019ve watched you, on every turn \u2026 across every moment of your journey.\n\nOne of the creature\u2019s countless protrusions lashes out at the empty air, forming another harsh, glowing fissure. It wrenches itself open in a few stilted jolts, a transparent, almost crystalline membrane stretched across the gap. Through it, I can see myself, in the centre of a cornfield, examining a block of C4 explosive.\n\nIt\u2019s as if I\u2019m staring into the past through a jagged shard of one-way glass.\n\n**VOICE:** I\u2019ve watched you questioning.\n\nThough we can\u2019t be seen through the aperture, I see the glasslike membrane shake with the force of the creature\u2019s voice. As the window collapses, I can see the rows of corn thrown into a frenzy.\n\nA second arc lashes out at the sky, forming a second aperture. This time I\u2019m expecting the sight before me. I see myself, crying in the forest\u2026 a silent radio by my side.\n\n**VOICE:** I\u2019ve watched you struggle.\n\nThe second window closes. The creature has made its point.\n\n**VOICE:** I\u2019ve watched you fight\u2026 to make your way here.\n\n**VOICE:** You will not turn around. \n\n**AS:** You make it sound like I don\u2019t have a choice.\n \n**VOICE:** You do have a choice Alice, but you have already made it.\n\nAs much as I\u2019ve grown to detest the creature\u2019s presumption, in that moment, I know it\u2019s right.\n\nWhat it\u2019s saying is true. I\u2019ve done things I never would have imagined in order to get where I am now. In fact, if this being hadn\u2019t arrived at all, I\u2019d already be heading out over the bridge. \n\nI\u2019m not proud of what drives me; that same, ugly impulse that led me to refuse Rob\u2019s offer of return, that made it so easy to leave him behind in the silent city. But there\u2019s no denying the impulse is there. It\u2019s been with me the whole time, long before I ever arrived in Phoenix, Arizona\u2026 and it\u2019s buried deeper than I\u2019ve ever wanted to admit.\n\n**AS:** Can I\u2026 do I get to say goodbye?\n \nThe entity says nothing. It hangs in the air, flickering and coursing with rupturing bolts of light. The next thing I hear is a faint mechanical hum emanating from the Wrangler behind me. Turning around, I pace briskly back to the car, opening the door and reaching into the passenger seat. My notebook is booting up, seemingly of its own accord.\n \nPicking up the laptop, I lift the lid as I march back towards the bridge. I stare up at the silent being before me. When I look down to the laptop, my email client is already displayed on the screen.\n \n**AS:** How\u2026 how long do I have?\n\n**VOICE:** Long enough.\n \nThe entity begins to regress, its arcs diminishing as the being at its core turns away. Its message has been delivered. There is nothing more to discuss. \n\nAs it passes through the gateway, into an unknowable world far removed from my own, I call out after it.\n \n**AS:** I\u2019m still not certain I trust you.\n \nThe being focusses on me once more, as the fracture begins to close. A final set of waves pass across the surface of the lake as it solemnly replies. \n \n**VOICE:** \u2026 I remember.\n \nA moment later, the being is gone.\n \nI stand motionless in the middle of the road, the entity\u2019s final remarks washing over me, its curious choice of words echoing in my head. In the renewed silence, the faint stirrings of an overwhelming and terrible revelation start to form in my mind.\n\nIt could have simply said that it knew of my mistrust, that it heard the overtones in my voice, saw the disdain across my face or otherwise sensed it in the space between us. Instead, the being spoke as if my current feelings were a memory, dwelling somewhere within its depths.\n\nIt was undeniable that my time on the road was changing me, but in all this time I\u2019d never truly considered how those changes might evolve as my journey continues. \n\nI\u2019d never thought about what I might gain, what I might lose\u2026 or about what I might inevitably become.\n\nA short while passes before I lower my eyes from the empty space above the bridge, to the screen of my notebook. Lowering myself down, I cross my legs and rest my back against the Wrangler.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been reading from the beginning, you\u2019ve finally caught up with me.\n\nI hope you\u2019ll allow me a few personal messages.\n\nTo Rob. I hope you\u2019re able to read this someday, and I am so, so sorry for everything I\u2019ve done; for everything I may do. I hope you understand that I didn\u2019t know, and that none of this was your fault. You did the best you could, and the days I spent with you were the most significant of my life. It was an honour to know you and I hope that, among these pages, you find the answers, and the peace, that you deserve.\n\nTo my mum and dad, I\u2019m sorry I won\u2019t be sending this to you. In the end, I was carried along this road by a profound selfishness, and I just can\u2019t bring myself to face you. I can\u2019t imagine the pain I\u2019ll be putting you through, and I won't try to justify my actions. All I can say is that I love you and I\u2019m sorry that my last act towards you was one of cowardice.\n\nAnd finally to you; the person to whom this message will be addressed. I\u2019m sorry. I always thought I\u2019d see you again someday, that the roads I took would eventually lead me home. That doesn\u2019t look so likely now. Though I could say a lot to you, I\u2019m not going to.\n\nBut I wish we could have been friends for longer.\n\nIt feels like a lifetime since I first arrived at Rob Guthard\u2019s quiet street. I remember the uncertainty as I waited for him to open his door, with no concievable idea what was about to transpire. \n\nLike so many other things, that\u2019s now changed. Despite being in an entirely new world, further from home than anyone\u2019s ever been, I know exactly what\u2019s going to happen next.\n\nI\u2019m going to take a drive. Take a left, then the next possible road on the right, then the next possible left. I will repeat the process ad infinitum, until I wind up somewhere new. \n\nAnd from there I\u2019ll keep driving, beyond worlds, beyond time, beyond the bounds of my imagining. To a place where the lake runs dry, where the broken moon drifts away, and the stars disappear in the rear view.\n\nTo a place where everything has fallen away, and the road is all there is."},"275":{"title":"My friend and I made \u201cghost pornography\u201d for fun.

It started off with sexy cosplay, then I photographed Suicide Girls style, and finally, when I had people up to pay enough, solo porn.\n\nI used to live in a crappy kitchenette, but once I was successful enough, I was able to afford a nicer place. Things got better when I moved in with my new roommate, but also weirder.\n\nI\u2019m not using our real names or our artistic names here because I\u2019m scared as fuck.\n\nMy new roommie, Savannah, was a cheerful and sweet girl. Her perky personality had flocked plenty of followers and fans, way more than I had myself, and she was making some good money; for instance, she was a homeowner at 22.\n\nHer place was huge, and she decided to rent her extra room for an attractive price, as long as the other resident was fine with her vast collection of sex toys being displayed in the living room.\n\nI thought that was hilarious and we immediately hit it off, so the other resident became me. The fact that we were both nude models helped our friendship, but to be fair I had met some other girls in my field before, and most of them were a stick in the mud.\n\nSavannah was nice, tidy and amazingly respectful of my personal space. She didn\u2019t act like she owned the place, even though she literally did. I had spent a good few months before things started to go south.\n\n\u201cSo, Ayla\u201d, Savannah approached me over breakfast. \u201cWould you be willing to collab with me? I have a request for a private two-girl job and I thought it made sense to invite you first since it will be so much easier to arrange our schedules.\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t doing much, just my nightly streaming, my regular sets and my sets for patreons. I asked more about the job.\n\n\u201cWell\u201d, she laughed. \u201cI have to tell you it\u2019s one of a kind. It\u2019s nothing dehumanizing or anything, but it\u2019s weird as fuck. This guy\u2026 he jerks off to shadows. He wants us to pretend we\u2019re fucking them.\u201d\n\n\u201cFucking the shadows?!\u201d I asked, and laughed loudly. She confirmed, laughing too. It was insane, but relatively harmless, like when some guy paid me 5 grand to legally bind me to not show my feet to any other man but him for a whole year. So I only take my socks off to shower and it\u2019s been months since I don\u2019t go to the beach.\n\nWhen Savannah told me how much the client was willing to pay for such a thing, I was immediately in.\n\n\u201cIt will be so embarrassing, but kinda fun, right?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYeah, and with that I can finally stop taking private requests and focus on other things\u201d, Savannah replied, happily. She\u2019s sort of a do-it-all artist \u2013 model, photographer, painter and so on.\n\nA few more e-mail exchanges with [shadowfucker@\\[redacted\\].com](mailto:shadowfucker@[redacted].com) and he had approved of me and discussed the details with Savannah. He wanted two videos a week \u2013 on Mondays and Thursdays, and each should be at least 30 minutes long.\n\nA very reasonable request, considering that, with my share of what he was paying, I could drop everything else and still live comfortably.\n\nHe would send us the equipment before the first week, then outfits every two weeks.\n\nI was the one to receive the large box from UPS, as Savannah wasn\u2019t home. I knew she had a P. O. box to avoid disclosing her real address, but this one came straight to our place.\n\nWeird, but considering how big this client was, I could understand her making an exception for him, and didn\u2019t say anything about it.\n\nLater that day, we opened the box. It contained some light strobes, a few large but hollow wooden and metal objects, eight sets of costumes \u2013 wigs included \u2013, a photograph and a small package marked *otherworldly condoms*.\n\n\u201cWow, imagine being this lunatic!\u201d Savannah grabbed the little package laughing, then opened one of them.\n\nThey looked nothing like regular condoms; they were more like those plastic bags you use to freeze stuff, but the material was so much thinner and slightly iridescent.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably something he made up to make it more realistic, right?\u201d I asked, then read the instructions aloud. \u201cWhen having sex with the shadows, make sure to protect your whole groin with otherworldly condoms. They can unfold to thrice its size.\u201d\n\nThe outfits were actually cute and we spent some time deciding when we were going to use each of them; the client had perfectly guessed our sizes.\n\nThen the photograph finally caught my attention.\n\nIt showed the right way to arrange the equipment on the room, but funnily enough, the room depicted was incredibly alike to Savannah\u2019s studio \u2013 our third bedroom. Unlike me, she didn\u2019t often film\/shoot in her own bedroom, preferring to use a mostly neutral room where she could set up scenarios or just take cleaner pics and videos.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but feel that the picture had been taken exactly in her studio \u2013 *at the very place we lived.*\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe day of our first video came \u2013 a Monday. It didn\u2019t take us more than 15 minutes to set up the whole equipment on the studio exactly like the picture showed. The objects projected large shadows on the room, and the lights were set to slowly move on their own, so our interaction with the shadows was like the strangest sexy dance \u2013 but at least we weren\u2019t standing still for half an hour pretending to fondle the same empty spot.\n\nDespite thinking that it was wacky, Savannah was a professional and she diligently used the otherworldly condoms as requested. I used them as well, and for 35 minutes, we pretended to fuck shadows.\n\nI felt utterly ridiculous, but being used to doing solo videos, I pretty much knew how to do it. The color of the lights and the outfits really helped set a soothing mood that made it all less shameful.\n\nSavannah then turned off the cameras and looked at me.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t awful, was it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was okay\u201d, I agreed. I could make a fool of myself for some good money.\n\n\u201cDo you want to shoot a second one and end this week early?\u201d\n\nBefore I could reply, her phone buzzed loudly.\n\n*From: <Unknown Number>: Remember, shoot twice a week. Separately.*\n\nWe stared at each other in confusion.\n\n\u201cMaybe there\u2019s a mic hidden in the equipment?\u201d I suggested. \n\nWe searched the whole room but found nothing.\n\nI didn\u2019t think much about it. Rich people are controlling. They know things, always. The client knew when we were going to film the first video, and of course he figured we would consider doing everything on the same day instead of having to disassemble the set and reassembling it again.\n\nI went about my day, and nothing strange happened. Savannah seemed much more alive because now she had time for her hobbies, and I was doing well enough to start sending my family some money, something I had wanted to do for a long time.\n\nWe were to send him the first video on the day we recorded the second and so on. On Thursday, Savannah told me the client loved our first video, and looked forward to the next. To get us a little more comfortable with our weird thing, we had some wine and put on jazz music.\n\nThis time things went smoothly, but I kept hearing some humming while we pretended to fuck the shadows. I was sure it wasn\u2019t coming from the music.\n\nI asked Savannah and she didn\u2019t hear anything. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re a bit drunk? Slow down on the wine next time, home girl!\u201d\n\nFor our video number 3, I was completely sober and asked Savannah to do it without music. She agreed, and in the total silence, I still heard the humming.\n\nIt was a humming that wasn\u2019t there before, and it didn\u2019t come from the light strobes either. I was so focused on it and intrigued that my face looked really unsexy and Savannah\u2019s editor called to ask if there was an issue.\n\n\u201cShe just keeps listening to some humming. Yeah, I\u2019ll tell her to see a doctor. Think you can mostly show her from behind? Cool, you\u2019re an angel!\u201d\n\nSavannah looked more worried about me than anything else, so I promised to see a doctor. Maybe something was wrong with my ear \u2013 even though something only felt off while we filmed the videos; at least now I could afford some high-quality healthcare.\n\nBetween the filming of videos 3 and 4, I got my ears checked, but they were perfectly normal. Savannah reiterated that it was totally cool if I wanted to give up on this freaky fetish-video thing and she would get another girl for that, no hard feelings.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t feel like the videos were the problem. There was just this weird *thing* I couldn\u2019t quite understand.\n\nOn video 4, Savannah was tipsy and seemed to be really enjoying herself. I felt a little guilty that she was clearly overcompensating for the fact that I was worried and gloomy on the previous video.\n\nThe humming evolved to whispers. And for the first time, I heard \u2013 no, it was more like understanding for the context, with the intuitive side of my brain \u2013 a few words.\n\n*\u201cI actually like this.\u201d*\n\nAt last that\u2019s what I foretold that the whispers said. It probably sounded more like *sfslsosls dlsowllss swowllls*.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nOnce again, I didn\u2019t tell anyone. I was almost convinced that I was actually being crazy. It was just an eerie feeling because I was stripping to and groping empty spaces twice a week.\n\nOn the Friday after recording video 4, we got a new box with outfits. There was another photograph, instructing us to rearrange the lights and boxes to, I imagine, create different shapes with the shadows.\n\nI couldn\u2019t restrain myself this time.\n\n\u201cSavannah, don\u2019t you think this pic looks exactly like your studio?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that helps a lot, right?\u201d she smiled, and then slowly realized what I meant, her smile withering. She grabbed the photo from my hand. \u201cOh, now that you said it, it\u2019s quite alike. But of course no one broke into the house, right? I think that\u2019s a standard room.\u201d\n\nBut she sounded shaken.\n\nI think that\u2019s the reason why she completely forgot the otherworldly condom.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nWe made the preparations as usual; changed the setting as the photo instructed, dressed up, put on our wigs and make-up. \n\nThe whispering immediately started, and for a moment I got lost in it, trying to understand. A buzzing sound, then another.\n\n*\u201cThere\u2019s food today.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cIt tastes good.\u201d*\n\nThen Savannah screamed.\n\nI didn\u2019t realize she wasn\u2019t wearing the otherworldly condom either \u2013 not until I saw her groin covered by the blackest of blacks, then her legs disappearing into the darkness of the shadows.\n\nLike she was involved by long and thick pieces of deep-black fabric, her torso and head disappeared too. She didn\u2019t seem to be in pain, but in shock \u2013 everything was so quick and uncanny.\n\nI reached out for her, but there was nothing there.\n\nMy hands grasped thin air.\n\nI immediately turned off the light strobes, turned on the normal lights and moved all the boxes around. They were still hollow as ever and Savannah was nowhere to be found.\n\nI then searched the whole house fruitlessly. \n\nIt\u2019s ludicrous to say that, but shadow-people took my friend.\n\nI sat on the floor and cried, worried about Savannah and about what I would tell the police about her disappearance.\n\nI was a mess, and decided to cancel my live-streaming that night for personal reasons.\n\nAs soon as I opened the browser, an e-mail notification popped on my screen.\n\n*From: <*[*shadowfucker@\\[redacted\\].com*](mailto:shadowfucker@[redacted].com)*>*\n\n*It\u2019s not your fault that your friend neglected my one rule.*\n\n*I like you, Ayla.

I\u2019ll deal with everything regarding Savannah as well.*\n\n*Find me a new second girl for the videos, the cash and outfits will keep coming.

There's no way I can respond to each of you individually, so I'm just going to address some common things again, and then move on to the stories. I'm going to write as many as I can think of, in addition to my friend's stories, and I will probably not update again until I get a chance to answer some questions that I myself have for my superiors.\n\nAlright, so the common questions I found you all had:\n\n* I am not comfortable talking about where exactly I work, unfortunately. In all reality some of the things I've mentioned here could get me in a lot of trouble or fired, so it's best if I just don't discuss too much. I will say that I'm in the United States, and in an area that is comprised of a great deal of wilderness. We're talking hundreds of miles of thick forest, with a mountain range and a few lakes.\n\n* There is still a great amount of interest in the stairs, and luckily for you guys my friend has a story that I think you'll all be very interested in. I'll go into that more at the end of this update. As for whether or not I have ever thought of asking my superiors about them, I have, but again, I don't want to risk my job. However, one of my former superiors no longer works as an SAR officer, and it's possible that he may be willing to talk to me about it. I'll be speaking to him later in the week, and I will let you all know what comes of that.\n\n* As far as advice on becoming an SAR officer goes, I think the best advice I can give is to contact your local Forest Service office and see if they offer and training courses, or what the qualifications are. I've been doing this for years, and I started out as a volunteer helping on SAR operations. It's a great job, despite the occasional tragic situations, and I wouldn't want to do anything else. \n\nAlright, let's move on to the stories:\n\n* The first happened on a case that I went out on right after I got out of training, and was still pretty new to everything. Before I took this job, I was a volunteer, so I had a basic idea of what to expect, but on those calls you're mostly dealing with finding lost people after vets have found signs of them. As an SAR officer, you go out for all kinds of cases, from animal bites to heart attacks. \nThis case got called in early in the morning, from a young couple who were up on one of the trails that goes by the lake. The husband was completely hysterical, and we couldn't really figure out what was going on. We could hear the woman screaming in the background, and he was begging us to come up there right away. When we get there, we see him holding his wife, and shes got something in her arms. She's screaming these awful, almost animal-like screams, and he's sobbing. He sees us and he screams at us to help them, to please get an ambulance up there. Now obviously we can't just drive an ambulance up the walking path, so we ask him if his wife needs help, or if she can walk on her own. He's still hysterical, but he manages to tell us that it's not his wife that needs help. I go over while one of the vets tries to calm him down, and I ask the wife what's going on. She's rocking, holding something, and just shrieking, over and over. I crouch down and see that whatever she's holding, it's covering her with blood. That's when I notice the sling on her front and my heart sinks. I ask her to tell me what's going on, and I sort of pry her arms gently open so I can see what she's holding. It's her baby, obviously dead. His head is caved in on one side, and he's covered in scratches. Now, I've seen dead bodies before, but something about this whole situation hits me hard. I have to take a second to compose myself, and I get up and go get one of the other vets, who's standing by. I tell him that it's a dead kid, and he sort of pats my shoulder and tells me he'll deal with it.\nIt took us over an hour to get this woman to let us see her kid. Every time we try to take him from her, she flips out and tells us we can't have him, that he'll be okay if we just leave her alone and let her help him. But eventually, one of the vets manages to calm her down, and she gives us the body. We took it back to the med area, but when the EMTs showed up, they told us that there was never any hope of saving the kid. He'd died instantly from the trauma to his head.\nI was good buddies with one of the nurses who met them at the hospital, and she told me later what had happened. Turns out the couple had been walking with the baby in the sling, and they stopped because the kid was fussing. The dad takes the kid and is holding him, looking out over this little gully by the path. The mom comes to stand next to him, but she ends up stepping on a loose patch of soil, and she trips. She falls into the dad, who drops the kid, who ends up falling about twenty feet down this little gully onto the rocks at the bottom. The dad climbed down and recovered the kid, but he'd fallen right on his head, and was dead by the time he got there. The baby was only about fifteen months old. It was a total freak accident, a series of events that coalesced into the worst possible outcome. Probably one of the more awful calls I've been on.\n\n* I haven't seen a lot of animal bites in my time as an SAR officer, mostly because there aren't that many animals that come around the area. While there are bears in the area, they tend to stay pretty far away from people, and sightings are highly unusual. Most of the animals you'll see are small ones, like coyotes, raccoons, or skunks. What we do see frequently, though, are moose. And let me tell you, moose are nasty fuckers. They'll chase after anything for any reason, and god help you if you get in between a female and its baby. One of the more amusing calls was of a guy who'd gotten chased down by an absolutely massive male moose, and was stuck up a tree. Took us almost an hour to get him down, and when he was finally on solid ground again, he looks at me and says: 'God damn. Them fuckers is big up close.' I guess that's not really a scary story, but we still laugh about that one.\n\n* I honestly don't know how I'd forgotten this story, but it is, by far, the scariest thing that's happened to me. I guess maybe I've tried so long to forget about it that it just didn't come to mind right away. As someone who spends literally all of their time in the woods, you don't ever want to let yourself get scared of being alone, or out in the middle of nowhere. That's why when you have experiences like this, you tend to just forget about them and move on. This is, to date, the only thing that's ever made me really seriously consider if this job is the right one for me. I don't really like talking about it much, but I'll do the best I can to remember it all.\nAs I recall, this took place right at the end of spring. It was a typical lost-child call: a four-year-old girl had wandered away from her family's campsite, and had been missing for about two hours. Her parents were completely despondent, and told us what most parents do; my kid would never wander away, she's so good about staying close, she's never done anything like this before. We assure the parents that we'll do everything we can to find her, and we spread out in a standard search formation. I was partnered with one of my good buddies, and we were sort of casually holding conversation while we hiked. I know it sounds callous, but you do sort of become desensitized when you've done this long enough. It becomes the norm, and I think to a certain extent you have to learn to desensitize yourself in order to work this job. \nWe search for a good two hours, going well beyond where we think she'd be, and we come out of a small valley when something makes us both stop in unison. We freeze and look at each other, and there's almost a sensation like a plane depressurizing. My ears pop, and I have this odd sensation of having dropped about ten feet. I start to ask my buddy if he felt that, but before I can, we hear the loudest sound I've ever heard in my life. It's almost like a freight train passing directly by us, but it's coming from every direction at once, including above and below us. He screams something to me, but I can't hear him over this deafening roar. Understandably freaked out, we look all around us, trying to find the source of the sound, but neither of us sees anything. Of course, my first thought is a landslide, but we're not near any cliffs, and even if we were, it would have hit us by now. The sound goes on and on, and we're trying to yell to each other, but even standing close together we can't hear anything but this sound. Then, as suddenly as it starts, it stops, like someone threw a switch and cut it off. We stand there for a second, perfectly still, and slowly the normal sounds of the woods come back. He asks me what the fuck just happened, but I just kind of shrug, and we stand there looking at each other for a minute. I get on the radio and ask if anyone else just heard the end of the fucking world, but no one else hears it, even though we're all within shouting distance of each other. My buddy and I just sort of shrug it off and keep going.\nAbout an hour later, we all check up on the radios, and no one's found the little girl. Most of the time, we won't search when it gets dark, but because we don't have any kind of lead on her, a few of us decide to keep going, including me and my buddy. We keep close together, and we're calling out for her every couple of minutes. At this point, I'm hoping beyond hope that we find her, because while I may not like kids, the idea of them being out all alone in the dark is awful. The woods can be intimidating to kids in the daylight; at night, well, it's a whole different beast. But we're not seeing any signs of her, or getting any responses, and around midnight, we decide to turn around and head back to the rendezvous point. \nWe're about halfway back when my buddy stops and shines his light to the right of us, into a really thick deadfall, or group of dead trees. I ask him if he's heard a response, but he just tells me to be quiet a second and listen. I do, and in the distance, I can hear what sounds like a kid crying. We both call the girl's name and listen for any kind of response, but it's just this really faint crying.\nWe head in the direction of this deadfall and go around it, calling her name over and over. As we get closer to the crying, I start getting this weird feeling in my gut, and I tell my buddy that something isn't right. He tells me he feels the same way, but we can't figure out what it is. We stop where we are, and call the girl's name again. And at the same time, we both figure it out. \nThe crying is on a loop. It's the same little hitching sob, then wail, then quiet hiccup, repeated over and over. It's exactly the same every time, and without saying another word, we both take off running. It's the only time I've ever lost my composure like that, but something about it was so incredibly wrong, and neither of us wanted to stay out there anymore. \nWhen we got back to the rendezvous, we asked if anyone else had heard anything strange, but no one else knew what we were talking about. I know it sounds sort of anti-climactic, but that call fucked me up for a long time. As for the little girl, we never found a trace of her. We keep an eye out for her, and all the other people who we've never found, but frankly I doubt we'll ever find anything. \n\nOf the missing persons calls I've gone out on, only a handful have ever resulted in a complete disappearance, meaning no trace of the person and no body ever found. But sometimes, finding a body just leads to more questions than answers. Here are some of the bodies we've found that have become infamous in our team:\n\n* A teenage boy who's remains were recovered almost a year after he vanished. We found the top of his skull, two finger bones, and his camera almost forty miles from where he was last seen. The camera, sadly, was destroyed.\n\n* The pelvis of an older man who had vanished a month earlier. That was all we found. \n\n* The lower jaw and right foot of a two-year-old boy on the highest peak of a ridge in the southern part of the park. \n\n* The body of a ten-year-old girl with Down's Syndrome, almost twenty miles from where she'd vanished. She had died of exposure three weeks after going missing, and all of her clothes were intact except for her shoes and jacket. There were berries and cooked meat in her stomach when they did the autopsy. The coroner said it appeared as if someone had been taking care of her. There were no suspects ever identified.\n\n* The frozen body of a one-year-old baby, found a week after vanishing in the hollow trunk of a tree ten miles from the area he was seen last. There was fresh milk found in his stomach, but his tongue was gone.\n\n* A single vertebra and right kneecap of a three-year-old girl, found in the snow almost twenty miles from the campground her family had been at the previous summer.\n\nNow on to  a couple of the stories my friend told me. I mentioned that you were all interested in the stairs, and you're in luck: he's had a closer encounter with them. Though he doesn't have any explanation for them, he does have a bit more experience with them than I do. \n\n* My buddy has been an SAR officer for about seven years, he started when he was a junior in college, and he had a very similar experience when he first encountered the stairs. His trainer told him almost the same thing mine did, which was to never go near, touch, or ascend them. For the first year, he did just that, but apparently his curiosity got the better of him, and on one call he broke away from the line and went to go check a set of them out.\nHe said they were about ten miles from the path where a teenage girl had vanished, and the dogs were following a scent. He was on his own, lagging behind the main group, when he saw a set of stairs off to his left. They looked like they were from a new house, because the carpeting was pristine and white. He said that as he got closer, he didn't feel any different, or hear any weird noises. He was expecting something to happen, like bleeding from his ears or collapsing, but he got right up next to them and didn't feel anything. The only thing, he said, that was odd was that there was absolutely no debris on the steps. No dirt, leaves, dust, anything. And there didn't appear to be any signs of animal or insect activity in the immediate area, which he found strange. It was less like things were avoiding them, and more like they just happened to be in a relatively barren part of the forest. He touched the stairs, and didn't feel anything except that sort of sticky feeling you get from new carpet. Making sure his radio was on, he slowly climbed the stairs; he said it was terrifying, because the way they'd been stigmatized, he wasn't really sure what was going to happen to him. He joked that half of him expected to be teleported to some other dimension and the other half was watching for a UFO to come swooping down. But he got to the top with little event, and he stood there looking around. But, he said, the longer he stood on the top step, the more he felt like he was doing something very, very wrong. He described it as the feeling you'd get if you were in a part of a government building you have no business being in. As if someone was going to come and arrest you, or shoot you in the back of the head, at any second. He tried to brush it off, but the feeling got stronger and stronger, and that's when he realized that he couldn't hear anything anymore. The sounds of the forest were gone, and he couldn't hear his own breathing. It was like some kind of weird, awful tinnitus, but more oppressive. He climbed back down and rejoined the search, and didn't mention what he'd done.  \nBut, he said, the weirdest part came after. His trainer was waiting back at the welcome center after the search ended for the day, and he cornered my buddy before he could leave. He said his trainer had this look of intense anger, and he asked what was wrong.\n'You went up them, didn't you.' My buddy said it wasn't phrased as a question. He asked how his trainer knew. The trainer just shook his head.\n'Because we didn't find her. The dogs lost her scent.'\nMy buddy asked what that had to do with anything. The trainer asked how long he'd been on the stairs, and my buddy said no more than a minute. The trainer gave him this really awful, almost dead-eyed look, and told him that if he ever went up another set of stairs again, he'd be fired. Immediately. The trainer walked away, and I guess he's never answered any of the questions my buddy has asked him about it since.\n\nMy buddy has been involved in a lot of missing persons cases where there's never been a trace of them found. I mentioned David Paulides, and my buddy said he can confirm that those stories are, for the most part, accurate. He said that most of the time, if the person isn't found right away, they're either never found, or they're found weeks, months, or years later, in places they can't possibly have gotten to. One story he told me really stood out that involved a five-year-old boy with a severe mental disability.\n\n* The little boy vanished from a picnic area in the late fall. In addition to the mental disability, he was also physically handicapped, and his parents explained over and over that he simply could not have vanished. It was impossible. Someone had to have taken him. My buddy said they searched for this kid for weeks, going miles out of the accepted range, but it was like he'd never been there. The dogs couldn't pick up his scent anywhere, not even in the picnic area where he'd apparently vanished from. Suspicion fell on the parents, but it was pretty clear that they were devastated, and hadn't done anything sinister to their kid. The search was concluded about a month later, and my buddy said everyone had pretty much forgotten it by later in the winter. \nHe was out on a training op in the snow, on one of the higher peaks, when he came across something in the snow. He said he saw it from far away at first, and when he got closer, he realized it was a shirt, frozen and sticking part way out of the powder. He recognized it as belonging to the kid, because it had a distinctive pattern. About twenty yards away, he found the kid's body, laying partially buried in the snow. My buddy said there was no way the kid had been dead for any more than a few days, even though he'd been missing for almost three months. The kid was curled around something, and when my buddy brushed off the snow to see what it was, he said he almost couldn't believe what he was seeing. It was a big chunk of ice, that had been carved crudely to look sort of like a person. The kid was holding it so tight that it had frostbitten his chest and hands, which my buddy could tell even with the decay that had taken place. He radioed the rest of the crew, and they took the body off the mountain. \nNow, he recapped all of this for me, and to put it simply, there was no way this kid could have both survived for almost three months on his own, or have gotten to this peak. There was no physical way this child could have walked almost fifty miles and ended up on the top of a god damn mountain. To top it off, there was nothing in the kid's stomach or colon. Nothing, not even water. It was like, my buddy said, the kid had been taken off the face of the earth, put in suspended animation, and dropped on this mountain months later, only to die of exposure. He's never really gotten over that one.\n\nThe last story I'll share from him was one that took place relatively recently, only a few months ago. \n\n* They were out doing a recon for mountain lions, because there had been several reports of sightings in the last couple of days. One of our jobs is to scout out the areas where these animals are seen to ensure that if they are in the area, we can warn people and close off those trails. He was out on his own in a very heavily forested part of the park toward dusk when he heard what sounded like a woman screaming in the distance. Now, as most of you know, when a mountain lion screams, it sounds almost exactly like a woman being brutally murdered. It's unsettling, but far from abnormal. My buddy radioed back and let ops know that he'd heard one, and that he was going to keep going to see if he could figure out where its territory started. \nHe heard the mountain lion scream a couple more times, always from the same spot, and determined the approximate area of the mountain lion's territory. He was about to head back when he heard another scream, this time within only a few yards of him. Of course, he freaks out and starts heading back at a much faster pace, because the last thing he wants is to run into a god damn mountain lion and get mauled to death. As he got back on the path and started heading back, the screaming followed him, and he broke into a jog. When he was about a mile from ops, the screaming stopped, and he turned around to see if it was following him.\nIt was almost night by this point, but he said in the distance, just before the path rounded a corner, he could see what looked like a male figure. He called out to them, warning them that the paths were closed, and that he needed to come back to the welcome center. The figure just stood there, and my buddy started to walk over. When he was about ten yards away, the figure took, as he described, 'and impossibly long step' toward him and let out the same scream my buddy had been hearing. My buddy didn't even say anything, he just turned and sprinted back to ops, never looking behind him. By the time he got back, the screaming had moved back into the woods. He didn't mention it to anyone else, just said that there was a mountain lion in the area and that they would need to close those paths until the animal could be located and moved. \n\nI'm going to end this entry here, since it's turned into a huge wall of text. I'm going to be heading out on a yearly training op tomorrow morning, so I'll be gone until early next week. I'll be meeting with a  lot of former trainers and buddies who work in other areas of the park, and I'll be asking around about any stories they'd like to share. I'm so glad you guys have been interested in my stories, and once I'm back from this op, I'll continue to share them!\n\n**EDIT: Part 4 is up: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3jadum\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/**"},"277":{"title":"I found the bunker of a prepper family who went missing three years ago","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/11txaos\/i_found_the_bunker_of_a_prepper_family_who_went\/","flair":null,"author":"ChristianWallis","selftext":"Dr Daniel Vance was a smart man. Too smart for his own good, maybe. Forty years old, a lecturer in fluid dynamics with a mind made of shapes and numbers. No one knows why but one day, on a whim, he crunched the numbers on the apocalypse and came to a troubling conclusion. He didn\u2019t share exactly what it was he\u2019d deduced, but given that he immediately quit his job and liquidated his many assets, it\u2019s fair to say it wasn\u2019t positive. Swept up in the wake of this tremendous upheaval was his wife, a twenty-four year old PhD student who had grown infatuated with Daniel some time before. She loved the strange bear of a man who could just as easily build a log cabin as he could explain the idiosyncrasies of an asteroid\u2019s orbit. Speaking to Daniel always left you with the profound impression he was right, so when he told her what he wanted to do, she agreed.\n\nFifteen years and five children later, the Vances were living in the distant woods just beyond my hometown. They were enigmatic, richer than the Pope, and extremely serious about their prepper lifestyle. But they were also funny, easygoing, and incredibly compelling to speak to. Larger than life survivalists who swept into town with bizarre requests that thrilled local businesses. Vast quantities of cement, iron, lead, and steel were all shipped through the remote mountains so that the Vances could build their shelter. The advanced methods they used to keep it secret were legendary. Daniel had once spent six months earning the licence necessary to drive HGVs up to his compound so that no one else would lay eyes on it. And on one occasion when a company had refused his request for GPS tracker-free vehicles, he bought them out wholesale so that they had no choice.\n\nSo when they stopped appearing in town during the pandemic, when requests for food and goods stopped and all contact was dropped, most attributed it to lockdown. They had a bunker and had spent their entire lives training to be self-sufficient in the face of civilisation\u2019s collapse. Even Alexander, the youngest at just three, was already collecting firewood as a chore, and learning what local plants were edible. Most of us just assumed that if anyone could ride out Covid without breaking a sweat, it would be the Vances.\n\nThe reality turned out to be something else.\n\nWhen the worst came to light, we discovered that Daniel had used the pandemic as an excuse for a dry-run. The family intended to spend six months in lockdown and essentially beta test their fallout bunker. Three months in and the Sheriff received a distress call on the radio. Coordinates were provided by the hushed voice of a sobbing child that most assume was Alexander, even though that\u2019s never been proven.\n\nThe police arrived and found the bunker still sealed. It took hours for emergency responders to cut into the door, all the while efforts were made to contact the family within but to no avail. Once inside, police were left dumbfounded. There was no one to be rescued. No bodies. No survivors. There was evidence the door\u2019s locking mechanism had failed and trapped the Vances inside with no way out, but if so where had they gone? \n\nBeds and cots lay everywhere with mouldering yellow sheets, buckets close to hand with stains all around them. Some doors were barred, others smashed to pieces. There was even evidence of makeshift quarantines and, in places, what looked like violence. The police, usually a fantastic source of gossip, were not forthcoming until the town demanded answers and the Sheriff was forced to offer only the barest of outlines. \n\n*An outbreak of a waterborne illness had struck the Vances down not long after they were locked inside and unable to seek help. Rumours of contagion were overstated, fuelled by the unrelated rise of Covid. Whatever contaminant had killed the Vances, it was non-organic in nature. No need to panic. The Vances loved-ones had been notified. The bunker was going to be demolished, and we could all put this terrible tragedy behind us.*\n\nOf course we still had questions. A thousand of them. Why hadn\u2019t the family called for help? They had radios, computers, smartphones too. They were survivalists, not Amish. And where *were* they? What had happened to their bodies? Why hadn\u2019t they simply left? We shouted these and more at the town meeting but the police simply refused to comment. For most of us the excitement lasted another week or two until we realised we weren\u2019t getting answers any time soon. Besides, the pandemic was in full swing and most of us had other things to worry about. The tragic story eventually faded until it was just one of those awful things in the town\u2019s history that we didn\u2019t talk about. I was as guilty as anyone else of just forgetting about it.\n\nI certainly never expected to find the bunker out there in the woods, faded police tape still on the open door that hung wide open with scorch marks around the lock. It stood out in the woods like someone had cut a hole right in the fabric of reality, the darkness so deep and black it almost ached to look at. The sight of it made my heart drop into my stomach. It radiated pain. Does that make sense? I think some part of my lizard brain picked out details that wouldn\u2019t become apparent to me until I got closer, like the bloody finger streaks that stained the handle from where someone had scrabbled furiously at the lock without success. And the tiny viewing window had been smashed with a hammer that still lay nearby. I needed only to glimpse it to imagine the family taking turns to stand there and scream into the woods desperate for rescue. \n\nUnder any other circumstances, I would have run.\n\nBut I\u2019d gone there looking for my dog, and my light revealed a few wet paw prints making their way down the dusty concrete tunnel. Half Bernese and half collie, Ripley is the sort of dog who trembles in my arms when a storm buffets the windows and needs his paws held when we brush him. I love him. I do not have much of a family, or a wife, or even many friends. But I have Ripley, and I could no more have turned around and gone home to an empty apartment where I would have to sob my grief away than I could flap my arms and fly. He was my dog and I\u2019d raised him since he was a puppy, and I wasn\u2019t going to leave him out in those woods.\n\nI went in after him.\n\nI didn\u2019t know what to expect, but I knew it wouldn\u2019t be good. Whatever the police had found, they\u2019d not only kept most of the morbid details to themselves, they had also lied. The bunker was not demolished, or even sealed off. In fact, looking at the occasional blue latex glove tossed aside and the one or two broken police-issue flashlights, it seemed like the last people inside had been in a hurry to get out. Given this was where seven people had presumably died, I assumed it was *someone\u2019s* job to clean it all up. But the corridor looked largely untouched. Just a few metres in and manic writing started to cover the walls, the desperate scrawls of a lone survivor left there to be rediscovered like cave paintings. Most were deliberations on how to get out. Diagrams. Blueprints. Equations and formulae. All focused on the door and the circuits responsible for its faulty lock. I instinctively assumed they belonged to Daniel and that he\u2019d been the last to die. What a God awful fate for a man to outlive his children. And yet it got worse. Slowly the writing changed from equations and plans to a desperate scrawl. The same few phrases repeated over and over. \n\n*Five doors. Five. Not six. Six. Didn\u2019t make it. Didn\u2019t make it. Six doors. Six.*\n\nIt seemed like the kind of thing you\u2019d find in an asylum. A psychotic rambling punctuated only by six paragraphs right at the end. Each letter was impeccably neat, and each small paragraph was topped with a beautifully drawn Christian cross.  \n\n*Elliott Vance aged fifteen. A gifted guitarist. He liked boys even though he thought I did not know. I loved him with everything I had. He would have made a great man.*\n\n*Alicia Vance aged fourteen. She liked to paint and to shoot. She had her mother\u2019s mean streak. It would have served her well in the future.*\n\n*Elijah Vance aged eight. The smartest of us all\u2026*\n\nThese were Daniel\u2019s memorials to his family, and seeing the words lit up by my torch was a haunting insight into the overwhelming despair he\u2019d endured. He must have realised he wouldn\u2019t get the chance to speak at his family\u2019s funerals or to write their obituaries. This was his last desperate way of making sure the world might one day know them as he did - as real people.\n\nThe words marked the end of the tunnel, standing adjacent to a trapdoor in the ground. It was not open but the tunnel came to a dead end immediately afterwards and Ripley\u2019s prints disappeared at the hatch. I feared he might be in danger, but still I stopped and looked at the bunker door twenty metres behind me. The once gloomy forest looked so bright, even on this cloudy day, the air dotted with rain. A part of me felt like I was leaving the whole world behind as I began to climb the ladder down.\n\nI entered a large circular living space that was packed with furniture and little nooks and crannies. The walls were covered with folding beds and tables and every inch was multifunctional. A dining space could become a sitting space, which in turn might be where someone slept, or even exercised. It all depended on what particular bit of furniture you unfolded or unclipped or unfurled. Seven people in close quarters, nowhere near enough privacy, it made sense they went with this cluttered overlapping use of space. But it was still a large room, bigger than most studio apartments. And there were a few corridors that led deeper into the Earth telling me the bunker had unseen depths. \n\nI looked for some sign of my dog and soon found his trail, but this far from the rainy copse Ripley\u2019s prints were starting to fade. After barely a few metres they petered out vaguely in the direction of a nearby door. I wanted to follow but stopped myself from rushing onwards. It was unlikely Ripley was getting out any other way, and I\u2019d do us no good getting hurt myself. I decided to take a look around and quickly spotted a dinner table. \n\nIf I needed proof the police had not bothered with a clean up, this was it. The plates were still out, the food rotten to a strange blackened husk. A child\u2019s hat lay across one place-setting, the once-creamy fleece turned a sickly green and yellow. The chairs had their backs reinforced with wooden beams fitted with long grooves so that something the width of a nail could slide into them. And on each of the cushions were foul smelling stains that looked oddly like an ass print. I touched one with gloved hands and the material crackled audibly. Whatever it was, similar stains were on the cutlery and plates, and there were even handprints of it placed firmly on the tablecloth. At first I thought it was blood, but that wasn\u2019t quite right. It was too contained to be from leaking blood. On the back of one of the chairs a stain tapered exactly where a woman\u2019s waist would be like a near perfect silhouette. I shivered as I remembered that Miranda Vance had always been a slim woman and wondered how she had left her imprint on the grey fabric.\n\nUsing my torch, I saw that these stains repeated in the oddest of places. Yes, there were some on beds and blankets and even patches of plain floor exactly like you might expect in a room full of sick people. But why did one stain on the floor bear such a strong resemblance to a child huddled in the foetal position? And why was the same stuff all over the tv remote, and on books on shelves, and board games too. Everything from sofa cushions to DVD boxes to piles of dirty laundry were covered in the same dried brownish material that gave off a foul coppery miasma.\n\nI found the jigsaw particularly baffling. Someone had set up another table with four chairs, all modified with the same back support as those by the dinner table. And a jigsaw had been lain out with four separate piles, but only one was depleted. The rest looked largely untouched, almost like someone had portioned out pieces for three other people who had absolutely no interest in going along with it. Maybe Daniel had tried to keep up morale while the family were sick? God help me, if that were true I couldn\u2019t help but imagine the poor man sat there with his loved ones close to death, desperately trying to encourage them to click their own pieces into place while they faded in and out of consciousness.\n\nSomething about that room emanated madness, and the longer I stayed down there flicking the bright disk of light of my torch from one detail to another, the more I wanted to leave. One door had wooden beams nailed across it. One sofa had been partially disassembled. Multiple beds had been burned. And all the light bulbs had been removed and put in a box on the kitchen counter top. Looking up at the ceiling, I finally had some insight into why the police were so confident the Vances had not survived despite never finding their bodies. Someone had jammed a human finger into one of the empty sockets, almost like they\u2019d expected it to glow with the flick of a switch.\n\nWhat was it about this place that had caused the police to leave and never return? Not to even take that finger and test it for signs of illness, or even just to confirm who it belonged to?\n\nI decided it was time to hurry up and find my dog. People had died in that place, and while I\u2019m not superstitious, I can\u2019t be the only sceptic who has done the calculations in his head and realised it costs nothing to be respectful of ghosts. That bunker was cramped, terrifying, and the air stank so bad I started to worry I\u2019d get sick myself. It served no one any good to linger. But I\u2019d be damned if I\u2019d just walk away and leave Ripley to rot down there. It\u2019s not like he could climb a ladder and get out on his own (even if I wasn\u2019t entirely sure how he\u2019d gotten down there in the first place).\n\nSummoning what little bravery I had left I called out and broke the silence, something which felt like a terrible taboo in that God awful place, like screaming in a graveyard.\n\n\u201cRipley!\u201d \n\nI waited and hoped to hell I\u2019d hear the pitter patter of his paws, but for the longest of moments there was only the kind of silence that makes you wonder if someone or something in the darkness is holding its breath trying to look like just another patch of nothing. Biding its time until you finally turn around and show it your back\u2026\n\nThe TV came on with a blurt of white noise that was so loud and so sudden I cried, threw my arms up, and nearly fell backwards onto a rolled-out sleeping bag that looked like it had spent a week in the sewer. By the time I realised what had caused the noise, I could already hear a tinny rendition of Daniel Vance\u2019s voice.\n\n*\u2026I realise the issue here. I need to emphasise just how little I understand anything that\u2019s\u2026*\n\nI frowned at the screen as I approached. It showed a greenish infrared view of the bunker with Daniel upfront, and the dinner table behind him. It was grainy and hard to see, but I could clearly tell that his family were sitting in those chairs. \n\n*\u2026Miranda was first to fall ill. Looking back it makes perfect sense. Miranda often went into storage to fetch food for cooking and we found it behind one of the refrigerators. So that\u2019s\u2013ah shit..*\n\nOne of the figures in the background slumped onto the table with a loud *clank* and sent a plate spinning off onto the ground.\n\n*Shit shit shit*, Daniel muttered as he got up and grabbed the woman by the shoulders and sat her upright. *Miranda never did like my cooking!* He snorted a laugh as he fussed with something at the back of the chair. *The rods are much better than tape. All those hours spent taping them upright to the chairs. Never worked. But the rods\u2026 they fit right into the spine and with a little modification I can just slot them into the chairs. That way everyone is able to join in for dinner. I\u2019m working on something similar for family game night.* \n\nDaniel wandered over to the camera and with a grin he lifted it from the tripod and scanned the dinner table. What I saw nearly made me drop my torch. \n\nHis family were long dead. Gaunt faces. Missing noses. Lips that had receded to reveal awful grins. These were corpses, plain as day, even when viewed through such a low resolution image. The only thing that made them seem remotely alive was the way their eyes still reflected the infrared back so that they glowed in the dark. And yet Daniel seemed oblivious to it all. He tousled Elliot\u2019s hair. Kissed his wife on the cheek. Run a hand across one young girl\u2019s shoulder. He even picked the young Alexander up from his high chair and I assume he coddled him. I don\u2019t know for sure because I looked away, unwilling to see the poor boy up close.\n\nEyes averted from the screen, I couldn\u2019t help but pan my torch across to that same dinner table and shiver as I finally realised what all those stains were. Not quite blood. But close. *Liquefying flesh.* Left alone for months, Daniel had not put his family\u2019s bodies to rest. Instead he had moved them around from place to place and puppeted them, living life as if nothing had really changed. Looking at where those stains had settled I saw a clear pattern emerge. He had put them to bed. He had set them dinner. He had propped them up to watch TV, or gave them their favourite books. They even sat there as lifeless husks while Daniel waited for them complete a fucking jigsaw. The idea horrified me to my core.\n\n*\u2026back to work. It\u2019s obviously not part of the original designs. No room on the other side, not on the blueprints. Elliot didn\u2019t believe me and why would he? I made every inch of this place, but I did not install that door in storage on the bottom level. I checked the cameras and some of the photos I took during the build and the wall is just blank. But the door is there now and it must lead somewhere. I don\u2019t know when or why it opens, but it does and the next time I\u2019ll be ready. Because I have to know what\u2019s on the other side, and why it did this to us. Alone down here, often all asleep at once. Anything could have slit our throats and been done with it. But it didn\u2019t. It took its time and I have to know why!* \n\n*It took our radios and computers and phones. One by one. None of us noticing until it was far too late. I kept telling the kids they needed to take better care of their things, and even as they complained I just assumed the phones were lying behind some shelf. Where else could they go in a locked bunker? But it wasn\u2019t the children at all. Looking back there are so many signs\u2026 who kept taking away the lights? Who kept draining the batteries in our torches? How long did we live with it before we finally realised we weren\u2019t alone? Was it here every step of the way?* \n\n*A door out of nothing that leads to nowhere, at least most of the time. Because I know for a fact it does not always open onto a blank wall. There is something behind it. I can hear it shuffling around in there, wet breath rattling in its lungs, a horrible sound I hear roaming these halls when it thinks I\u2019m asleep\u2026*\n\nI listened to Daniel, fascinated by this strangely compelling rant, when movement caught my eye. An infrared camera running in the dark, its image a roiling mess of uniform noise. What was it I\u2019d seen? I paused the tape and rewound. Squinting, I saw two pinpricks of light in the darkness just over Daniel\u2019s shoulder. Slowly, the image resolved itself in my mind. I knew what I was seeing and it turned my blood to ice.\n\nMiranda Vance had turned her head, and her lifeless eyes glowed as she fixed them on the back of Daniel\u2019s head.\n\n*\u2026not even any point leaving at this stage. I\u2019m no doctor, but that door is giving off enough radiation to\u2026 well, to kill a family of seven. If none of us had touched it\u2026 Being in the same room is risky, but not lethal. But given how sick we\u2019ve become, it\u2019s pretty obvious our curiosity got the better of us, one by one, and we all got too close. Or maybe not. Maybe that thing on the other side came through and did this. I don\u2019t even kn\u2026 wait\u2026 what was that?*\n\nDaniel turned and the camera stopped recording. The image it froze on was of a lone man, bright as a star in the camera\u2019s lens, facing off against unknowable darkness broken only by six pairs of white, glowing eyes.\n\nI became painfully aware of my position relative to the table and I had the painful premonition that if I turned, those chairs would not be empty. I would see the Vances, all of them, Daniel as well, waiting for me. Heads turned. Bodies left to rot for years in the dark. Behind me something shifted. It breathed. Loud. Quick. I knew what it was. *I knew*. It came at me so fast that when I felt something hot and wet touch my hand I screamed, only for the presence to suddenly recoil. But then, without hesitation, it leapt at me and bore me to the ground.\n\nI wept as Ripley licked my face. He was shivering and, worst of all, silent which was not normal. He was not a quiet dog, not when greeting me and not when excited like he was now. But whatever he\u2019d seen down here, he clung to me and dug his paws into my shoulders like he wanted to be cradled over the shoulder, something he has been too big to do for years. \n\n\u201cOh you fucking idiot,\u201d I cooed in a soft whisper and even in the dark I could feel his tail wagging. Joking aside, I felt nothing but relief at finding him. \u201cLet\u2019s get the hell out of here.\u201d\n\nI picked him up, straining a little under the weight but refusing to give into tired muscles, and made for the ladder. It wasn\u2019t easy climbing the three or four rungs to the hatch, but I managed it and gave the hatch a shove. First one hand, then two. Again and again, with everything I had, but still that hatch refused to budge.\n\n\u201cShit!\u201d I cried while pounding at it with my fists, but all I achieved was a sore wrist. The hatch had jammed when, somehow, the handle had been snapped clean off. Now I\u2019d need a pair of pliers or something to cut through the metal bar locking it shut. My fingers couldn\u2019t move it, nor could I brute force the hatch open. The metal bar was an inch thick and, at the very least, I\u2019d need some tools to get at it from this side. \n\n*At least it\u2019s fixable*, I thought as I climbed back down and caught my breath. On one wall I noticed a simple diagram of the bunker made in chalk. It had three floors. The bottom was storage\u2013Daniel had mentioned that before, and I noticed that he had drawn through it with a large red X\u2013and the top floor was labelled *Quarters*, where I stood now. But the middle floor was labelled workshops and it was there I realised that I\u2019d find what I needed.\n\nThere was one door that opened onto a concrete stairwell and, standing at the top, I shone my light down the spiralling guard rails unsure of what it was I hoped to see. There were only harsh shadows and the sense of something foul rising up on the air. A smell that tickled my throat and burned a little in my lungs. Had the police even gone down this far? Had they seen what I\u2019d seen on that TV and just left? Somehow I thought it was unlikely that had been enough to send the entire Sheriff\u2019s department running, so was it something else that had done it. Something that had been enough to terrify dozens of armed men. Something that was almost definitely down there. \n\n*The door\u2026*\n\nI went down quietly. At first I considered leaving Ripley behind, but after losing him the first time I decided I\u2019d rather risk it just to know that he was right next to me. Besides, he was being quieter than I was, and I didn\u2019t feel much like going down those stairs on my own. He accompanied me with only the quiet click clack of his paws on concrete, a sound I found deeply comforting as I barely managed to keep my torch from shaking in my hand and my breathing steady.\n\nDown one floor and I found the workshop exactly as you might expect. A large space filled with generators and fuel and water tanks and boilers and heaters and pretty much anything and everything that you\u2019d need to survive but which you couldn\u2019t put outside due to fallout. Wires pipes and tubes ran from one end of the room to the other and even years later, most of the machinery still hummed in the pitch black emptiness, an idea I found deeply unsettling. Taking one look at that strange tangle of harsh shapes and industrial figures looming out of the walls and floor, I shivered and looked around, quickly finding a small area Daniel had cordoned off for his own use. About a fifth of the total floor space, there was a large workbench and some seriously high end machining equipment, all very well used. Lathes. Buzzsaws. Drills. Belt sanders. Welding torches. Everything a man needed to do-it-himself.\n\nAnd Daniel had been busy.\n\nI\u2019m not sure exactly what it was he\u2019d been working, but there was an arm on the bench. It sat atop a pile of papers that had slowly turned brown over the years until the whole thing looked like it had been soaked in tobacco spit. On the whiteboard was a faded but still visible diagram of what looked to me like a ball-and-socket joint. I thought of the tape, of Daniel\u2019s little mechanism to keep his family upright, and then looked at the arm and suppressed a momentary gag reflex. I don\u2019t know if Dan had been working on posable limbs, or just a way to put the decomposing remains back together after they\u2019d started to fall apart, but the size of the arm suggested a pre-teen child, and he\u2019d left it out on the surface like it was a disassembled clock. It was also missing a finger. *Just how fucking crazy was he?* I wondered as I pinched my nose with one hand and began overturning boxes looking for a hefty pair of pliers, or maybe a hacksaw. Ripley backed away from the noise, but once I made sure he wasn\u2019t going anywhere I carried on grabbing and pulling at box after box hoping I\u2019d find what I was looking for. Anything to break that fucking metal bar.\n\nIn the end I managed to get a pair of bolt cutters, a crowbar, and a heavy duty pair of pliers. One went in my pocket, one went down the back of my jeans, and the other was clutched in my fist, too large to be tucked away in my clothes. The bolt cutters felt hefty in my hand which was a bit of comfort, but that feeling didn\u2019t last long.\n\nSomething moved in the darkness, out there in the twisted jungle of shadows cast by all those pipes and wires that ran from one machine to the next. A figure moved. Thin, but unmistakably human in its outline. I couldn\u2019t help but remember what I\u2019d seen on that tape. Surely it couldn\u2019t have been real? Maybe Daniel had rigged something up. Some fishing wire and a motor, maybe? The idea that those bodies had been moving on their own\u2026 I couldn\u2019t be sure of that, could I? It was a frightening idea, one my mind had latched onto out of sheer panic. That was all\u2026\n\nAnd then I saw them. A pair of white pin-pricks reflecting back at me from the depths of that cluttered room. Ripley, already behind me, head nuzzled into my leg, pushed even closer against me and let out a barely audible whine under his breath. The behaviour of a dog who was terrified, close to pissing himself with fear.\n\n*Just a bit of metal*, I told myself as the light shook so violently in my hand I struggled to see straight. *Just two shiny bits of metal\u2026*\n\nThey blinked and began to come towards me. If I had any doubts left, they were dispersed by the sight of a pale white hand emerging into the light.\n\nI ran straight to the stairs and went to climb them, but only one or two steps in and I saw something gripping the handrail on the top floor. A mouldy clump of flesh only just recognisable as a fist, the flesh withered until the fingers were basically bone. Without meaning to, I brought my light up out of habit and I saw the bloated face of a hairless corpse glaring down at me. I couldn\u2019t even tell you if it had been a teenage girl or the sixty-year-old Daniel, either way I instinctively turned and found another body shambling towards me out of the workshop. I was trapped. Nowhere to go. By the feel of warm fluid on the back of my leg I could tell Ripley had finally pissed himself. An adult dog, tail between his legs, shivering like a puppy and desperate to be picked up. God I needed him to just stay together for a little longer. I couldn\u2019t take him in my arms, but I couldn\u2019t leave him behind either\u2026\n\nWith nowhere to go I ran down and entered storage. There was the temptation to stop once I hit the bottom. Down here the air was thicker and the sounds of my breathing were muted, somehow distant. But I only had to look back up to see three pairs of eyes glaring down at me, so without giving any of it much further thought I barreled down the corridor and stumbled onto a door at random. Opening it, I saw what looked like your standard storage room, only most of the shelves had been overturned and the food left to rot on the floor. One or two shelving units were still upright though, and their shelves were covered in tall opaque boxes that made them a fantastic hiding spot. That, I decided, would have to be where I crouched down and turned off my light.\n\nI was already inside when I realised that wasn\u2019t all that was in there\u2026\n\nThe door *almost* looked normal. I could see why Daniel must have been confused by it because it looked a little bit like all the other doors down there, but it was different too. It was too tall and too wide, about a foot and a half off the ground, and the metal rusted in its entirety like it had aged out of sync with everything else down there. All around the jamb was a profusion of wet soppy moss like the kind you find hanging off trees in a swamp, and every few seconds the door would leak something strange and oily, like the kind of thing you find in a parking lot on a rainy day. Of course that wasn\u2019t too strange in itself, but the leak was horizontal, defying gravity so that every few seconds a large glob of the stuff would whip across the room and *slap* into the wall opposite creating a puddle about the size of a man that defied all reason.\n\nRemembering Daniel\u2019s words about radiation, I instinctively inched away from this puddle and the door on the opposite wall, backing myself into the darkest quietest corner I could while I pulled Ripley behind me and hoped to hell he wouldn\u2019t give me away. Once I was in there I turned off my light and waited.\n\nI must have taken longer than I\u2019d thought to hide spot because it was barely two seconds later when a few figures entered the room. It was pitch black after I\u2019d turned off my torch, but they made enough noise to let me know that at least two of them had stumbled in after me. I stayed there, unable to see anything, not sure if they were heading straight for me or just getting ready to leave, forced to hold out and let luck decide my fate. When I finally heard something scrape against the wall barely two feet from where I stood, I gave up and switched my light on, desperate to know what was coming for me.\n\nThe sound had been terribly misleading. \n\nDaniel Vance was no more than six inches from my face.\n\n\u201cGet out,\u201d he hissed from a toothless and cracked mouth. A living corpse just like the others, somehow a flash of intelligence remained in those wide, terrified eyes. \n\nAnd then I heard it. The creaking of a door. And without even thinking I turned the light and saw it on the wall. I saw *it* open, and behind the strange steel there was more than just plain old concrete. Much more. I saw a raging gullet of flesh. A ringed tube of pulsing muscle lined with teeth the size of hands. A spiralling descent into madness. Hot foetid air washed into the room, buffeting me and the rotting corpses, all of us paralysed by what we were seeing, even if for most of the figures beside Daniel and myself, they didn\u2019t have eyes to see with.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck\u2026?\u201d I muttered, unable to take my eyes from the flesh tube beyond that doorway.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s coming,\u201d Daniel whispered as he grabbed me with one fist and hurled me out of the room. I hit the floor and skidded along a slick fluid left by the Vance\u2019s footprints, the smell of which turned my stomach. Perhaps the worst detail was that it was cold. I don\u2019t know why, I\u2019d just expected whatever oozed them off them to be feverishly hot. But it wasn\u2019t. It soaked my shirt like I\u2019d fallen into a muddy puddle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\nThis voice wasn\u2019t Daniel\u2019s. I couldn\u2019t say for sure, but it sounded like a child\u2019s whisper. One by one the bodies shuffled over to the open door and knelt before it. I don\u2019t know why but I got the impression the others had lost pretty much everything left of their minds, but Daniel remained aware. He looked back at me once more and spoke before he pressed his head to the floor in supplication with the others.\n\n\u201cThe only thing we did wrong was being *here* for it to torture. It didn\u2019t need a reason, just an opportunity. Leave. It won\u2019t let us go. It won\u2019t even let us die. And if it catches you, it won\u2019t let *you* go either.\u201d\n\nHis forehead kissed the dirt. \n\nAnd then something reached through the door and gripped his head in its palm the way you or I might pick up an apple.\n\nIn full panic, I ran over and grabbed my dog and the bolt cutters and I ran like my legs were pistons, machines whose signals of exhaustion and fatigue could not slow me down, or cause me to fall. I had to move. I had to leave. The hand that had grabbed Daniel\u2026 the sight of it flushed my mind clean like some kind of enema. It hurt to see the image replay in my mind but there was nothing else in my head echoing around except the sight of fingers with one too many knuckles, and nails as large as a smartphone.\n\nI reached the top floor and nearly collapsed from breathlessness, but I wouldn\u2019t let myself stay down for long. I crawled over to the ladder and climbed up and immediately went to work trying to cut the metal lock. It was hell with just one hand, the other clinging to the torch that I kept frantically pointing at the door behind me, and it wasn\u2019t long before I fumbled one too many times and dropped my only source of light.\n\n\u201cNo no no no\u2026\u201d I mewed. But there was no time to look for it. I had to get out and I had to get out fast! I couldn\u2019t see but I was sure I could hear something climbing up those stairs. Not the steady *thump thump* of human feet. No this was different. This was a rapid pitter patter of a spider, maybe. Something with hundreds of feet or hands, or God knows what, skittering along the floor and walls and ceiling, pulling itself along with a body whose mere shape would offend God.\n\nUsing all my strength I leaned hard on the bolt cutters and, at last, the bolt gave. I threw the hatch open and got just enough ambient light to see Ripley hovering at the bottom of the ladder, growling ineffectually at the doorway. I crouched down, scooped him up, and fled up the ladder so quickly that my muscles turned to jelly at the top and I fell over onto hands and knees. But still, I was out. The long corridor covered in writing was ahead of me, and at the very end a doorway capped now by the tired blue light of a full moon.\n\nRipley needed no encouragement. He whipped down the corridor with canine speed and I followed at a broken and stumbling crawl, eventually shouldering past the open door and collapsing onto the forest floor.\n\nFor a few seconds I drifted in and out of consciousness, but when I looked up and saw the canopy overhead moving\u2013the branches backlit by a full moon\u2013I snapped awake and glared down at something gripping my ankle. The hand had reached out of the dark and seized me and was slowly dragging me back into the Earth below. Whatever it was, most of its body lurked out of sight in the shadows behind the doorway, but the hand that crushed my leg was the size of my torso with an arm that looked like it belonged to a mole rat.\n\nI struck it with my own fist. I dug my nails in. I cried and kicked and screamed, but nothing could stop it. From behind the door, something like a face grinned and leered at me with joy. It was taking its time, sure enough, pulling me in so slowly that it gave my mind all the time in the world to appreciate the nightmare that awaited me. I think if, in that moment, you\u2019d given me a gun, I would\u2019ve shot myself because God help me I couldn\u2019t escape the look in Daniel\u2019s eyes, how he\u2019d knelt to worship this thing like a man who knew that hope or pride or joy or anything with even a hint of goodness to it was so far out of reach for him it might as well be a dream. How long was this thing going to keep them down there? How long did it intend to keep *me!?*\n\nI wept like a child, feeling like my mind was slowly cracking as I tried everything to stop that fucking pulling me into the shadows. I kicked at the earth. I dug into it using my hands looking for a root or a pipe or anything to hold onto. Nothing, *nothing*, I did would slow it down.\n\nI was no more than a foot from the doorway when Ripley reappeared.\n\nA dog afraid of hoovers and plastic bags and doors that move on their own. A dog who once got stared down by a particularly feisty rabbit who stopped mid chase and turned around, baffling the predator on its tail. A dog you couldn\u2019t even watch scary movies around\u2026\n\nAnd he lunged at that arm like he was a wolf, like he\u2019d always been one. And while he didn\u2019t quite break the skin, the pressure was enough to make the thing\u2019s grip weaken and I slid my leg out. Unable to stand, I knelt and grabbed the dog and pulled as hard as I could and now that fucking thing bled at last as the pressure of the jaws and the sliding teeth ripped into its flesh. Together, at last, Ripley and I were let go and sent rolling backwards head over hells.\n\nI wasted no time waiting or looking or processing. I heaved the dog to my chest and crawled until I passed out, making it maybe half a kilometre away. Only when I could no longer see the door did I let myself fall to the ground face first and gave up consciousness.\n\n\\-\n\nThe doctors said I had pneumonia, which I suppose made some kind of sense. I might have even believed them were it not for the Sheriff\u2019s visit, asking strange questions of me as I lay in bed about what I may or may not have seen. I dismissed them to the best of my ability. I wasn\u2019t interested in chasing that particular nightmare down, figuring out if it had been real or not, at least not while I lay there half-drowning in my own infection. To be fair, I had at least some sympathy for why the police had done so little to seal that place off. I have, on occasion, thought about going and doing the job myself, but to this day I still have nightmares about being pulled into the dark beyond that door. Not just the bunker door, the one I narrowly avoided at the end, but the one *below*. What I saw was a kind of madness, I\u2019m sure of it, and I often think of Daniel\u2019s words. \n\n*It didn\u2019t need a reason, just an opportunity*.\n\nSomehow, the Vances were that opportunity. Maybe they built their bunker on a leyline, or a weak spot between dimensions, or the site of former Satanic rituals. I\u2019m not sure it even matters. They went into the dark thinking it\u2019d be a safe place to wait out the world\u2019s troubles, but something had been down there waiting for them, waiting for a chance to get at a family of seven people, to lock them in and deprive them of escape and slowly take from them everything it could.\n\nI\u2019ve moved since then. Couldn\u2019t help it. It wasn\u2019t just the memories you see. It was the short-wave radio I kept in my basement. Something my father passed onto me when I was just a boy. God I\u2019d forgotten about it\u2026 at least until I woke up one day to the sound of it blaring white noise down in the dark.\n\nAnd buried in that sound was the faint whispering of a man, his voice barely recognisable, but unmistakably *his*.\n\n*\u2026let them go let them go let them go let them go let them go let them go\u2026*"},"278":{"title":"When I was a kid, my dad kept a second family in our basement.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/it8166\/when_i_was_a_kid_my_dad_kept_a_second_family_in\/","flair":"Child Abuse","author":"hercreation","selftext":"Growing up, I thought everyone had a second family in their basement. In retrospect, I understand how ridiculous that sounds\u2026 but it was all I\u2019d ever known.\n\nI knew that every night, my dad tented the leftovers from dinner with foil, got up without a word, and carried the plate to the basement. I\u2019d listen from my room as he lumbered down the creaking steps, held my breath to hear the muffled mumblings of his greeting.\n\nI knew that every morning, he\u2019d make the trip downstairs to see his second family off before work, then kiss me on the top of my head and ruffle my hair as he walked out.\n\nI knew that each Christmas, he\u2019d bring a sack of brightly wrapped packages downstairs in a Santa suit.\n\nI knew that my dad had a second family in the basement, and it seemed so normal that I thought *everyone* else did too.\n\nI\u2019ll never forget the first time I asked my mom about them. I was young \u2013 maybe five \u2013 when I finally found the words to ask: \u201cMommy, why can\u2019t I play with the people in the basement?\u201d\n\nMy mom was the human embodiment of frenetic energy, an organic perpetual motion machine. Always pacing, or cleaning, or stirring a pot. Always with a lit cigarette tucked between her yellowing fingers.\n\nI\u2019ll never forget that, as that question hung in the air, she finally *stopped* for the first time. Her stillness was unsettling in a way I can\u2019t quite explain.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about them,\u201d she rushed, chasing the hurried statement with a lengthy drag off her cigarette. She blew a plume of smoke out the opened window before leaning down to meet me at face level, her bloodshot eyes mere inches from my own. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to play with the kids, but the kids need Daddy.\u201d\n\nShe paused again, the haunting image of her at a standstill etching itself into my mind permanently. Finally, she muttered, \u201cDaddy needs them too.\u201d\n\nThat night, I heard my mom shrieking at my dad in their bedroom. I was surprised that they didn\u2019t know that I knew, more shocked \u2013 frightened, even \u2013 to find that they didn\u2019t *want* me to know. Most of all, they didn\u2019t want me to tell anyone at school \u2013 anyone at all, really.\n\nAfter that night, everything was different. My dad only tented the leftovers after dinner, only brought the food downstairs after I\u2019d gone to bed. He stopped visiting them in the mornings altogether. My mom started acting differently, too. I\u2019d always noticed that she was\u2026 distant from my dad; had always noticed how she bristled under his touch, how she stole away to the other side of the room whenever he entered. But it got worse after that\u2026 as a kid, I felt deeply guilty. I felt like I\u2019d ruined my parents\u2019 marriage.\n\nBut I was just a kid, and I was curious. My mom meant to dissuade me from asking more questions, but she accidentally gave away something that made me even *more* curious \u2013 the downstairs family had kids, maybe kids my own age to play with.\n\nI wanted \u2013 *needed* to know about them, in the way that little kids *need* to understand all of the strangeness of this chaotic world, *need* to make sense of the nonsense that surrounds us daily. The nonsense that we become acclimated to as adults but struggle with endlessly as children, like a puzzle or a riddle or a word problem on a math test about buying eighty watermelons.\n\nAnother change following that critical night: the basement door was fitted with sturdy lock. Even still, I needed to know\u2026 there\u2019s something horribly dreadful about finding out that a second basement family is abnormal, something more horrible still about not knowing who or *why.* By the time I was seven, I made up my mind to get to the bottom of it.\n\nTo avoid getting in trouble, I could only investigate when three conditions were met: I was home from school, my dad was still at work, and my mom wasn\u2019t around to catch me. These circumstances rarely overlapped, but the first time I came home from school to find that my dad\u2019s car wasn\u2019t in the garage and my mom\u2019s endless movement had driven her to the point of exhaustion, I threw off my shoes and crept to the basement door, quiet in my sock feet.\n\nAnd then, I knocked.\n\nIt was a quiet knock, for fear of waking my mom from her nap, but it was a knock, nonetheless. It was more than just a knock, too, it was an initiation, an invitation, a confrontation of my life\u2019s greatest \u2013 and most terrifying \u2013 mystery.\n\nI jumped when a gentle knock returned from the other side. It was almost immediate\u2026 like the person on the other side had been *waiting* for me. The thought froze me in place for a moment, but I knew I didn\u2019t any have time to waste.\n\nMy mouth felt suddenly of sandpaper and chalk, but I leaned into the door to whisper, \u201chi.\u201d\n\n\u201cHi.\u201d\n\nIt was a little girl, her voice sweet yet timid. Like testing the keys on a piano for the first time.\n\n\u201cI-I\u2019m Ricky. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\nA long pause.\n\n\u201cLila. My brother\u2019s is Isaac, but he doesn\u2019t talk so good. But he\u2019s still little. Mommy says he\u2019ll start talking when he\u2019s ready.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s three of you down there?\u201d\n\n\u201cMhmm,\u201d she replied simply, as if the entire situation felt as wholly normal for her as it had for me, on the opposite side of the basement door. \u201cDaddy comes to visit sometimes, though, so I guess there\u2019s four.\u201d\n\nMy eyes widened as a flurry of questions began to sprout in my mind, but I heard my mom start to stir in her room. I sped down the hallway and into the playroom. I busied my hands with my toys, but my mind was somewhere else\u2026 the sprouts of questions continued to grow rapidly, soon overtaking my thoughts like an unruly patch of weeds.\n\nAnd like weeds, the questions were stubborn; hard to \u2013 *impossible* to get rid of. The roots of the situation and its implication unraveled, stretched through my whole body. Fear planted itself firmly in my belly as I was forced to confront the possibility that I didn\u2019t really know my dad, didn\u2019t really know my own family at all. If my dad was Lila\u2019s dad, too, what did that mean for me? For my family?\n\nAnd why wasn\u2019t she allowed to come out of the basement?\n\nOver the next couple years, I stole away to the basement door in those rare moments of freedom. I got to know Lila, got to like her and eventually even to love her \u2013 she was my best friend. As a kid, I was pretty lonely; my classmates shied away from me for reasons I couldn\u2019t quite understand, like something about me was inherently repellant to my peers. I only had one friend at school.\n\nAnd at home, I had Lila.\n\nAs we spoke more, a never-ending stream of back and forth questioning crammed into the briefest moments of time, we both came to understand the differences between us, between our lives and our circumstances. The differences that at first felt so *normal* grew bigger and sharper and scarier than either of us could comprehend.\n\nThe unfairness of it all became impossible to ignore.\n\nLila lamented that she wasn\u2019t allowed to go to school, that she couldn\u2019t go outside to play or make friends or ride bikes around the cul-de-sac in the summer until the streetlamps flickered on and the cicadas started to scream. She even longed for the things I loathed most\u2013 homework, rinsing off my dishes after dinner, tidying up my room each Sunday morning.\n\nShe said she\u2019d lived in that basement all of her life, was probably even *born* down there. She couldn\u2019t remember anything different before being locked up in the cold and musty room.\n\nI\u2019m ashamed to admit this, but, eventually\u2026 I couldn\u2019t manage the guilt I felt for living the life Lila never had, *could* never have in my mind. I was so young, so na\u00efve\u2026 I didn\u2019t know how to manage the situation anymore, so I did the only thing I could think of.\n\nI stopped trying.\n\nI stopped visiting Lila. No more secret, whispered exchanges; no more quick knocks on the door just to let her know that I was there, that anyone at all was there for her. Days and weeks and months and years trickled by with Lila never quite leaving my thoughts, but with her existence instead\u2026 *compartmentalized*.\n\nConfined to the basement of my own mind.\n\nAt home, it was harder to keep thoughts of her locked away. When my dad brought her dinner hours past my bedtime, I\u2019d lay awake warm in my bed. Sometimes I\u2019d hear her scream. Sometimes I\u2019d hear the tray clatter to the floor, the plate fracturing on impact. Sometimes I\u2019d hear her crying \u2013 awful, painful sobs \u2013 while I assembled new Lego sets in the playroom.\n\nSometimes she\u2026 she would call out my name. I\u2019ll never forgive myself for this \u2013 I hate myself for it, and I *deserve* to \u2013 but I ignored her every time.\n\nWorst of all, though, was when she started knocking.\n\nI was finishing up my science homework for the day when the first knock came.\n\nA quiet knock\u2026 but a knock, nonetheless. An initiation, an invitation, a *confrontation*.\n\nMy blood ran cold as I realized where it was coming from; *who* it was coming from.\n\nI hopped on my bike and didn\u2019t come home until dinner was on the table.\n\nThat night, I heard my dad scream back at Lila for the first time. Yelled for her to *knock it off* with all the knocking. He took care of her, of her little brother and her mom, and that he could only do that if she stayed in the basement, if she stayed quiet.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t persuaded, though, and her knocking only grew more frequent, and *louder*. I was about ten years old by then, so I had a little more freedom\u2026 all the freedom in the world, compared to Lila. I avoided my house at all costs, only returning in the evenings, where I\u2019d be greeted immediately by the knocking.\n\nBy then, it was less knocking and more ramming the total weight of her body into the door. My mother took to vacuuming the house obsessively just to cover up the noise. She wouldn\u2019t even look my dad in the eye anymore. I imagined the bruises blooming on Lila\u2019s shoulder, up and down the length of her arm. If it hurt her, she didn\u2019t let on.\n\nShe didn\u2019t stop.\n\nSleep became a distant memory, leaving me dazed and irritable and confused and \u2013 most of all \u2013 terrified. I began showing up at my schoolfriend\u2019s \u2013 now my *only* friend\u2019s \u2013 house unannounced just to escape Lila\u2019s knocking.\n\nHis parents clearly didn\u2019t like me, and tensions rose between the two of us kids, escalating to a boiling point that ended in a fight. I slugged him in the gut, and he returned with the words that broke me \u2013 broke *everything*.\n\nA blow far more powerful than he could\u2019ve delivered with small hands balled up into fists.\n\n\u201cMy mom says you\u2019re a *bastard*, that your mom\u2019s a *whore!*\u201d\n\nI had to look up the words in my dictionary when I got home.\n\nI had to gather the courage to, once again, ask a difficult question: \u201cMom\u2026 am I a bastard?\u201d\n\nI had to watch my mom lose her momentum, to *stop* again.\n\nI had to watch what little light she had left in her go out.\n\nI had to sit there as she left the room, had to sit there spilling hot tears as the knocking kicked up again, each powerful thrust against the door wracking my mind, a painful reminder that Lila was coming for me.\n\nBut, my mom came back, and she returned with an old newspaper clipping in her hands, worn at the edges. She held it to her chest as she finally \u2013 *finally* \u2013 told me the truth about Lila, about Dad\u2019s second family in the basement.\n\nI was young, but I needed to know. My mom knew it, too.\n\nThrough choking sobs, she told me about my dad\u2019s old family, the one he\u2019d had and *made* before he met her. The horrible mistake they\u2019d made, the one that gave her the best thing she\u2019d ever had in her life but took away three others. About how my dad\u2019s old wife was already skating on thin ice, her cries for help that went unanswered, how when she found out about what my mom and my dad were doing that what little was left beneath her shattered.\n\nAbout how they couldn\u2019t have known, but about the guilt she carried regardless \u2013 \u201clike a heavy backpack, mom?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sweetie. But I can never put it down.\u201d\n\nThat Lila was dead; and Isaac, too. That their mom had done *that* to them, and then did it to herself too. My dad found them in the basement when he got home from work. That he\u2019d never forgiven himself, and my mom never had either. That when they reappeared back in the basement like nothing had happened, even after their bodies were taken and buried all those years ago, they couldn\u2019t think of anything to do but to give them as normal of a life as possible.\n\nYet another difficult question: \u201cbut\u2026 why do they have to stay in the basement?\u201d\n\nI found out later that evening, when my dad came home from work and unlocked the door. Lila came out of the shadows, and I flinched instinctively as I saw her face for the first time, saw the gaping hole in her face where her left eye should have been. Isaac was little like Lila said, but the oozing wound to his jaw would have made it nearly impossible for him to speak if he had the chance to grow up.\n\nI was scared at first, but I put on my brave face and took Lila by the hand. I played with Lila and Isaac for the first time; shared my toys with them, laughed with them. I didn\u2019t meet their mom that day, but I would, years later. Once she and Lila and Isaac knew what became of them, she struggled to cope. She doesn\u2019t come out often, but I treat her with kindness when she does. The woman I know her as now couldn\u2019t imagine doing what she did.\n\nMy dad\u2019s second family still stayed inside, but they were no longer confined to the shadows of the basement after that day. They became less of my dad\u2019s *second* family as we all became one larger family that laughed and played and loved together.\n\nI don\u2019t live in that house anymore\u2026 I\u2019m an adult now, with an enormous appreciation for all of the freedom and opportunities available to me that I once took for granted. I know my family is far from normal \u2013 even horrible and horrifying in many ways that I helped to perpetuate as a kid \u2013 but it\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever known. I love them\u2026 all of them.\n\nI still visit whenever I can, for birthdays and for Christmas and for summer vacations. And whenever I do visit, I take a moment to be grateful for the fact that when I knock on the front door, [Lila opens it](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/hercreation\/).\n\n[X](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/thecrypticcompendium\/)"},"279":{"title":"The homeless in my neighborhood don't just want change","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/vzyocc\/the_homeless_in_my_neighborhood_dont_just_want\/","flair":null,"author":"MrFrontenac","selftext":" Two whole years ago my wife Angie and I decided it was finally time to buy a house. We knew it was anything but a buyer\u2019s market, but we were sick of paying triple what a mortgage would be in rent every month.\n\nI\u2019m sure this story is familiar to some of you and we went through every stage of disbelief, anger and finally apathy after every competitive offer we put together was blown out of the water by a multinational investment corporation. \n\nI\u2019m not mad about the process anymore although it left me questioning where society was headed. \n\nHOW IS THIS LEGAL!! I WENT TO SCHOOL. I PAID OFF DEBT. I GOT A GOOD JOB. I DID EVERYTHING RIGHT TO STILL GET PRICED OUT THE FUCKING CITY I GREW UP IN!!! \n\nPerhaps some anger remains. But after setting our sights on the city\u2019s less desirable neighborhoods we finally got our home. \n\nOn June 1st we moved into a 4,500 square foot colonial. \n\nIt had hardwood floors that patinated like leather and the frosted plaster trim gave the ceilings the look of a wedding cake. The basement was a different story. It wasn\u2019t just unfinished; it was a dank hole in the ground and scribbled on the walls were strange spirals and crude faces.\n\n\u201cKids.\u201d The realtor had said like she knew who drew the markings. \u201cFixing up the basement would be quite the value builder!\u201d \n\nSo, sure, the kitchen had composite counters and the basement needed a sign above the entrance that read, \u201cAbandon all hope ye who enter here\u201d but we had a home. And a damn big one at that.\n\nThe catch was that it was a stone\u2019s throw from the freeway and that the area was known for its crime more than anything else. Angie said it was just a steppingstone, we\u2019d bank a year\u2019s worth of mortgage, hope the housing market keeps rocketing and move again in a year. \n\nThere were some flaws in her plan, mainly money, but I didn\u2019t say anything. I figured we\u2019d both adjust to like it there. \n\nThe first few weeks went smooth and me and the wife got to unpacking and introducing ourselves to the neighbors. Maybe it was the threat of crime and that there was comfort and purpose in knowing who you lived next to, but whatever it was our neighbors were incredibly friendly. \n\nWe felt at home quick and while there were some shocks, we made games out of them to take the fear away. \n\nWith the pops that permeated the night we had the game where we guessed whether the sound was fireworks or gunshots. When we passed large turds one of us would point and we played \n\nhuman or dog. \n\nUnfortunately, after just a couple weeks at this game we became experts at differentiating between these. Gunshots carry the sharp crack of the sound barrier being broken while fireworks go boom or pop. As for the poop let\u2019s just say that we hadn\u2019t seen any dogs large enough to lay landmines around town.\n\nThere was a homeless problem there for sure, but they minded their own business. Our neighbors seemed to see right through them. They\u2019d act as if they were ghosts. Like they weren\u2019t even there. Hell, everyone did. \n\nI\u2019d smile and say hello in passing. The least I could do was treat them like human beings.\n\nOne night after a movie I was at the sink washing the popcorn bowl. The window above looks out to our backyard which was heavily wooded for a city lot. When it was dark out, I could only see a sliver of what was outside beyond the reflection of myself in the glass. \n\nI frowned at the shadow of a tall dark stump. I don\u2019t remember a tree there. I swayed on my feet to see past my reflection. \n\nIn between the bushes, nearly out of sight, a man was standing still, staring back at me. My heart leaped and I dropped the bowl where it crashed in the sink. \n\n\u201cYou okay in there, honey?\u201d Angie shouted from the living room. \n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d I kept my eyes on the man and said nothing to Angie not wanting to alarm her. \u201cI\u2019m gonna take the trash out.\u201d\n\n\u201cOk.\u201d \n\nI walked by the trash without touching it and opened the back door. \n\n\u201cHello?\u201d Outside the wind was blowing hard and the branches of the buckthorn the man stood behind were waving wildly as if to warn me.  \n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I stepped forward to try and show I wasn\u2019t scared but it was the tepid step of prey like I was better planting my weight to run.\n\nThe man said nothing.\n\nI took another step forward more confidently this time but jumped when my movement activated the motion light. \n\nI composed myself and yelled. \u201cThis is private property! If you don\u2019t leave I\u2019m calling the police!\u201d \n\nNow this was the emptiest of threats and everybody in the neighborhood knew it. The cops made a point to show up an hour late if at all. \n\nThe man walked forward a few paces to where I could see him better. He was very tall and wore a heavy wool overcoat that stretched all the way to his ankles.  \n\nHe kept walking towards me, my brain was shouting but I froze in fear.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n\nHe stopped just in front of me. A white scar starred across his black skin just below the chin. He was at least six-foot-six but the coat that ran the entire length of his body made him gigantic. His face was recently shaven and gaunt.\n\nHe held out his fist at arm\u2019s length and when he uncurled his fingers, cupped in his enormous palm was a pill.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any drugs.\u201d I said.\n\nHis face didn\u2019t change any. There was no want or question in his eyes. \n\n\u201cYou want me to take it?\u201d I pointed at his hand but still his expression was static.\n\nI reached out and gently plucked the pill from his palm. I held it between my forefinger and thumb. It was just a pill capsule, whatever had been inside had been emptied.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I asked again.\n\nHe opened his mouth revealing the severed stump of a tongue and then he widened the enormous whites of his eyes. He began to mouth something but being tongueless I couldn\u2019t tell what. But my blood cooled because I felt certain it was some kind of curse.\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d I murmured. \u201cPlease leave.\u201d\n\nHe turned and stepped into the night and I watched the bushes sway in his wake as if he were a giant parting his way through the woods. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe next day was Saturday and I was determined to find out if anyone knew about this tall man. I walked to the strip mall and asked some of the homeless in the area, but as soon as I began to describe him, they all looked at the ground and shook their heads. \n\nThe pattern was repeated with every other homeless person I tried to talk to. On my way home, I stopped by two men working on a car at the end of a driveway.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d I started over to them. \u201cThis may sound a little crazy, but do you know of a tall fella around here that wears a giant coat?\u201d They both started laughing. \u201cSorry to waste your time.\u201d I turned to go.\n\n\u201cNo, no.\u201d One of them was waving me back. \u201cYou talking about a really big motherfucker?\u201d The man raised his hand to signify. \u201cYay high? Black coat? Nasty scars?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d I nodded.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s Tall Frank. What you wanna about him? You see him in your recycling?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, why?\u201d\n\n\u201cTall Frank\u2019s a can man. He makes his living that way.\u201d\n\nI nodded. \u201cHe was acting weird in my backyard last night.\u201d\n\n\u201cWeird how? Was he just looking like his weird self ?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. He was staring at me from outside. When I went out he tried to say something. Or mouth something.\u201d\n\nBoth of their brows rose. \u201cYou saying that Tall Frank tried to communicate with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d \n\nThey both looked at each other. \u201cTall Frank talks to nobody. And by talks I mean\u2026 communicating in any kinda way.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe cut his own throat to never talk again.\u201d The other chimed in. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just a rumor. Tall Frank showed up in this neighborhood twenty years ago. No one knows where he came from and the man can\u2019t tell ya. Yeah, people put all kinds of legend to those scars. Some say it was dog that bit him. But I never seen no dog that\u2019ll slice your tongue out.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t communicate with anyone how come he has the name Tall Frank?\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm. Well that\u2019s what my mama would call him.\u201d He leaned closer to me. \u201cShe used to tell me to watch my tongue or Tall Frank\u2019ll take it!\u201d He chuckled to himself.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think he wanted with me?\u201d\n\nThey both shrugged. \u201cNo clue. But you be sure to tell us when you find out.\u201d \n\nThey bent back to their work and I thanked them and went on far less assured than when I\u2019d first set out.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe next several days there was no sign of Tall Frank, but I began to fall ill. It was a headache at first, but soon I had heart palpitations and body aches that I almost let take me to the emergency room. \n\nI assured myself that there was no such thing as curses. Why was I letting one strange encounter with a homeless man dominate my every thought? Angie was working late recently and when I had the house to myself at night, I would stand at the kitchen window and stare into the backyard. \n\nI was obsessed and it wasn\u2019t long before I saw him again. I was wrapped in a blanket filling the teapot at the sink when I saw him standing in the same place as before.\n\nI dropped the pot and ran to the back door. \n\n\u201cHey!\u201d My head felt light and I was in that same kind of drunken state where your fear hardly speaks to you. I scampered through the backyard over to him. \u201cWhat do you want with me?\u201d\n\nTall Frank was staring at me. He gestured with his scarred neck for me to follow. \n\nI looked down at my bare feet, but he was already walking. \n\n\u201cHey! Just leave us alone!\u201d \n\nI stepped cautiously after him. When I got past the bushes where I could see the alley I saw him standing near the trashcans.\n\nI ran after him. \u201cYou! I don\u2019t ever want to see you back here again!\u201d With our difference in size and the blanket wrapped around my shoulders I\u2019m sure I looked to him like some angry hobbit. \n\nHe certainly didn\u2019t act intimated and I can\u2019t blame him. Tall Frank crossed the alley and sat on a crumbling retaining wall. He gently tapped the stone next to him for me to sit. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not fucking sitting.\u201d\n\nHe reached into his breast pocket and paused before pulling out an envelope. Then he put the letter in his other hand and reached in again and pulled out another. \n\n\u201cWhat are those?\u201d\n\nHe extended the envelopes to me, his long arm nearly stretched the entire alley. I approached the letters cautiously snatching them and stepping back. \n\n\u201cWhat are these?\u201d I muttered already distracted. They had both been opened and I took the papers out of one of the envelopes.\n\nIt was a handwritten letter on college ruled paper. All the ink was smeared like it\u2019d been dunked in water, but I could still read it albeit slowly. When I was done reading, I let my arm fall down to my side and stared at Tall Frank in disbelief. \n\nAngie had a lover. \n\nI looked at the other envelope and hardly had to read it to figure it out.\n\nThe letterhead read: Atlantic Life Insurance. \n\nA policy had been opened in my name for a quarter of a million dollars. \n\nI stumbled over to the retaining wall and sat. \n\n\u201cThe pills.\u201d I thought about the empty capsule he\u2019d shown me that I tossed aside. It was my emergency Albuterol. It had to be. A quick WebMD search showed that an overdose started with symptoms of headaches and heart palpations. \n\n\u201cAngie is trying to kill me?\u201d\n\nSuddenly I realized Tall Frank\u2019s arm was around me and he was patting my shoulder paternally. \n\nWe sat there in silence for a long time. \n\n\u201cThe things you can learn from people\u2019s recycling.\u201d I said.\n\nTall Frank nodded and we watched the upstairs light turn on and my wife appeared in the window. She twisted something in her fingers and then tapped it into a mug.\n\nA minute later I heard the back door open. \n\n\u201cHoney are you out here?\u201d Angie called. \u201cI made you some tea!\u201d\n\nI guess the homeless around her don\u2019t always want change.

We see a lot of strange and disgusting things, but what I saw last week has me questioning both my job and reality","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/dlhqu6\/ive_been_a_search_and_rescue_diver_for_12_years\/","flair":"Series","author":"travisliebert","selftext":"I\u2019ve been involved with water search and rescue for twelve years now. I\u2019ve seen a lot of upsetting and even unexplainable things in my time, but those pale in comparison to what I saw recently. Water search and rescue is often a depressing job. When someone gets lost in a forest, they can still be found alive days later. But when we get a call, it\u2019s almost always body recovery. People don\u2019t last long in the water.\n\nI can\u2019t tell you exactly where, but I live in a northern territory known for its water sports. Fishing, kayaking, diving - whatever it is, our waters probably have a solid reputation for it. Despite that, this area isn\u2019t some kind of resort. The waters here are cold and oftentimes vicious. Search and rescue operations here can be grueling and not many stick with it. There are a few older guys who have been doing it longer than me, but I\u2019m one of the most experienced around.\n\nLike I said before, this job is more body recovery than anything, especially here. We save more live moose from the water than live humans. And when we get a call about a missing child\u2026well we\u2019d be better off just giving our condolences. That\u2019s just how the waters are here. Our small town has one of the highest drowning rates in the country. But we look anyway, and usually we find a body.\n\nI\u2019ve considered quitting many times in my career. Most people quit after their first recovery. In training, we try to emphasize just how much water can distort a corpse, but nothing can prepare you for the harsh reality. It\u2019s not uncommon for us to find bodies bloated beyond recognition. Sometimes they barely even seem human. A lot of divers don\u2019t last long after seeing something like that. But I continued to do it after all these years. I figured if I didn\u2019t then no one would.\n\nHowever, the things I saw last week have made me reconsider that decision.\n\nI got the call around 11 A.M. A father had taken his ten-year-old son fly fishing. At one point, the father managed to stab a hook all the way through his finger. He went back up to his truck to get a first-aid kit. The boy was gone when he returned a few minutes later.\n\nWhen I first heard the story, I hung my head in silence for a moment. It had been raining heavily for almost a month now, and the waters were running faster than ever. To make things worse, it was unusually cold for the season. A number of people had gone missing in recent weeks. Many of them had yet to be found. I had little hope of finding the boy alive.\n\nMe and a couple of other divers were at the site where the boy went missing within an hour, and a larger search and rescue team located a few towns over was headed our way. We talked with the father and even searched the forest for a bit, hoping that he had just wandered off. But eventually we realized that we would have to begin searching in the river.\n\nThe moment I got in the water I knew the boy was gone. The current was worse than it had ever been, and even I had difficulty navigating the icy river. We looked for hours in the surrounding areas, and even expanded our search once the larger team had arrived. The boy was nowhere to be found.\n\nI was surprised. I hadn\u2019t expected to find him alive, but I had at least anticipated finding a body. However, there was no trace of him. The sun got low and the air grew colder. We were considering calling it off as nightfall approached and resuming the search the next day when I discovered something.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of creek beds around the river. Many of them have dried up as a result of encroaching vegetation or manmade efforts to divert the water. We usually don\u2019t pay any attention to them. However, with all of the recent rain, I noticed that one of the larger creek beds had begun flowing again. A surprising amount of water crashed through it, easily enough to carry a young boy.\n\nThe creek ran directly across a bend in the river, connecting it at two points. I followed it and realized that the boy could be located outside of our initial search area. As I approached where the creek reconnected with the main river, I felt a sinking feeling in my gut.\n\nThere\u2019s a place in the river where not even search and rescue divers are supposed to go. It\u2019s known as Badwater. This area lies on one half of the river and runs for about 100 yards. It\u2019s near a densely vegetated area, so we don\u2019t often have to worry about people swimming there. But a lot of disappearances occur in the surrounding waters. Despite that, I\u2019ve been warned not to dive there since I began doing search and rescue. Supposedly the undercurrent is so strong that even the most experienced swimmer would be swept away in an instant. \u201cDon\u2019t go near Badwater.\u201d It was a mantra of the older divers.\n\nThe creek ended exactly in the center of the Badwater region. As I reached it, I stopped and chewed my lip thoughtfully. If I went back and reported this to the other divers, they would tell me to let it go. They wouldn\u2019t let me dive there. But deep down I felt like the boy\u2019s body must be tangled up in some weeds nearby. If only I could find it. I hated the idea of that kid being stuck down there, slowly bloating and rotting away while his parents sat at home wondering where their boy had gone.\n\nBadwater didn\u2019t seem to be that bad. I\u2019d seen rougher waters before, but I knew looks could be deceiving. Just below the surface it could be flowing faster than I ever imagined. And I\u2019d be swept away in an instant. Besides, I wasn\u2019t supposed to dive alone. I almost turned back, but something made me stay. I stared into the river for a moment, thinking about the boy. Then I put on my gear and dropped into the icy waters.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was that the current actually seemed pretty weak. As a matter of fact, it was weaker than the rest of the river. The water was extremely deep there, and I could see only blackness below as I dove. I kicked deeper and deeper, thinking that the current might pick up lower down, but the opposite seemed to be true. The water was almost completely still.\n\nI went even deeper until finally green shapes began to materialize in front of me. I thought I\u2019d finally reached a bed of weeds. But, as I kicked lower, the truth came into full view. I felt vomit come up at the sight, an odd and dangerous sensation when you\u2019re wearing a scuba mask.\n\nCountless arms stuck up from the ground below. I thought I had come upon a trove of bodies, but the disgusting reality became even more apparent only a moment later. The arms grew directly into the ground. They even had roots that spread out from the base. It was as if someone had cut off hundreds of arms at the shoulder and planted them there. They were green, and I watched as they clutched at the water around them. They varied in size and seemingly age. Grotesque baby hands sprouted near the bottom, and they opened and closed their fists hungrily.\n\nIt was then that I saw the boy. His eyes stared sightlessly ahead as those grotesque arms pulled his dead body downward. It seemed they had just gotten ahold of him. The arms yanked at him, burying him in the surrounding sediment. They pushed and writhed and squirmed until he was securely buried up to the chest. I stared in mesmerized horror.\n\nThat was when the other bodies came into focus. There must have been at least four more, all in varying stages of decay. Some were bloated beyond recognition, only bulky, white masses that protruded loosely from the riverbed. I once again felt vomit rising in my throat and swallowed it back down. The fucking hands were feeding off the bodies, using them as fertilizer.\n\nThe moment I clambered out of the water I tore my mask off and retched. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about those disgusting bodies, those grasping hands. They were like some sort of carnivorous plant, yet they were so humanoid. I vomited again at the thought.\n\nI frantically ran back to our base camp and pulled one of the other divers aside. Moose was the most experienced person on our team. He\u2019d been diving for over twenty years ever since moving here. I told him about what I saw. When I  finished, he stared at me in cold silence.\n\n\u201cI told you never to go near Badwater.\u201d His voice contained an iciness that even his thick Louisiana accent couldn\u2019t conceal.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re concerned about?\u201d I was incredulous.\n\nHe placed a hand on my shoulder and squeezed tightly. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone else about this. If the others find out you went into Badwater\u2026\u201d He trailed off and thought for a moment. \u201cWell, it won\u2019t be good.\u201d He shook his head like a disappointed father.\n\n\u201cBut what about those things?\u201d I tried to keep my voice down, hoping no one would hear us. \u201cHow many people have died because of those fucking things?\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up.\u201d Moose said. \u201cWe have an agreement. There\u2019s a reason they only grow in Badwater. Don\u2019t fuck this up.\u201d\n\nI started to say something, but the words caught in my throat. He was keeping something from me.\n\nHe sighed and I saw something like sadness behind his eyes. \u201cSometimes you have to decide between lesser and greater evils. Even the best possible decisions can still keep you up at night.\u201d He went silent for a moment and only stared at me. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone about this. Maybe one day you\u2019ll understand.\u201d\n\nHe walked away after that and called off the day\u2019s search. Despite what I\u2019d told him, we continued to search for the next two days. By the third day we called it off completely and gave our condolences to the family.\n\nI don\u2019t know what the fuck is happening. Moose has been acting different towards me ever since. There\u2019s an iciness to him, but every now and then he\u2019ll shoot me a knowing glance, like we\u2019re in on some secret together. I\u2019ve noticed the other older divers acting strangely too. What did he mean by agreement? What the fuck were those arm things? I\u2019m considering quitting and moving away from here. I can\u2019t live with the knowledge that those things are down there, slowly feeding off the body of a young boy among countless [others](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/travisliebert).\n\n[Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/dmg9c8\/ive_been_a_search_and_rescue_diver_for_12_years\/)"},"281":{"title":"I died for six minutes in 2003.

It happened on an ordinary afternoon, at the point in my daily routine when I walked home from the bus stop. In the four blocks between the corner where I hopped off the bus and my front door, I started to feel nauseous.\n\nIt came on suddenly, without warning. I\u2019d felt just fine all day, ate a lunch of bosco sticks and marinara sauce, something I\u2019d eaten hundreds of times throughout high school. Before I had an opportunity to consider alternative causes, I broke out in a cold sweat.\n\nThen I felt the curious flutter in my chest.\n\nMy heart slipped into what I later learned was an episode of ventricular fibrillation.\n\nI became breathless and collapsed. What happened next has been told to me after the fact. I apparently sprawled in the road, where a woman driving a hatchback nearly crushed my skull beneath her tires. Instead, she screeched to a halt, tried to rouse me, then dialled emergency services when she failed to do so.\n\nEMS arrived to discover my heart had stopped beating. I was dead, technically. They transported my body to the hospital, and somewhere along the way managed to shock my ticker back to life. Thus began a harrowing weeks-long journey through the American healthcare system that led eventually to an ablation, pacemaker, and mountains of debt my family\u2019s still dealing with.\n\nBut my heart\u2019s alright.\n\nAnd thank f\\*\\*k it is, because what I learned that day has taught me never to thank God for anything.\n\nBecause for those six minutes, as my lifeless body traveled across the city accompanied by two paramedics working tirelessly to revive me, my soul transcended our world to visit the hereafter. During my visit, I learned things about our universe that I wish I hadn\u2019t. Perhaps in sharing my story, I might help our species prepare for what comes after we expire.\n\nIt began with light. Blinding, white, pervasive. It bathed me, calmed me. It was everything they tell you about. Beatific, welcoming, the stuff of spiritual experiences.\n\nI had the distinct feeling of ascent, like the light was lifting me skyward. I passed through several sets of gates, which my dizzied consciousness hardly registered. Upon reflection, I don\u2019t believe they were physical in any sense, and yet I recall the feeling of admittance, as if they might\u2019ve prevented me from rising had they remained closed.\n\nIn any event, I arrived in a place without dimension, a place beyond reality. It only made sense while I occupied it. I don\u2019t believe a corporeal being can make sense of the astral plane, something about its intangible existence defies translation.\n\nSo what I came away with were more impressions than images. I was not alone. Several life forces enclosed me upon my arrival. At first, because of my Christian upbringing, I believed them to be angels. In my incorporeal form, I made the spiritually-equivalent gesture of opening my arms, anticipating their embrace.\n\nInstead, I felt myself shackled by their powers, like a collared dog. Humiliation and terror came over me. These were not the ethereal beings I\u2019d been led to believe await us. These were cruel, unsympathetic overlords by whom I was fettered.\n\nWhy? I thought, my soul wailing like a petulant child.\n\nSomething like laughter returned, but it was cold, mocking. Thoughts floated into my consciousness like birds winging in and out of sight. They delivered some horrifying truths about existence that I\u2019ll do my best to relay to you now:\n\nOur universe, like many others running parallel to it, contains a pittance of the total energy in existence. It is a farm, used to produce souls, which only arise in the precise conditions found in our cosmos. When you hear scientists talk about the improbability of the existence of our goldilocks universe, it\u2019s because they don\u2019t actually come into being spontaneously.\n\nThey\u2019re designed. And the hands that craft them are not benevolent gods, but rapacious beings with little care for the creatures they create.\n\nOur ultimate purpose, I learned in the custody of the spirits that shackled me, was to ripen until we were ready to serve them on their higher plane.\n\nThe Big Bang gave birth to the universe to give rise to life to eventuate in humanity, a sufficiently conscious organism that may be harvested for use as slaves on a higher plane, where time and space dissolve into an eternity we spend in servitude.\n\nSix minutes in \u201cheaven\u201d felt like a lifetime, which I spent amusing what I perceived to be a childlike spirit with a penchant for psychologically distressing manipulation. It batted me around like a cat with a caught mouse, reveling in the pain it produced. Physical discomforts we imagine hell inflicting upon us pale in comparison to the torture of soul pain. Loss of a loved one comes closest, that piercing, emotional damage resulting from trauma.\n\nWhen it became clear my time had not yet expired on Earth and I was to return, I was told not to reveal their existence to the rest of my kind. My reward, they communicated to me, would be a marginally improved station among the slave population. Alternatively, if I managed to convince others of their existence, new horrors would await me when I returned.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine anything worse than what I experienced, subsumed beneath an ineffable grief and torment.\n\nFor weeks, I tried to explain to anyone who would listen what I experienced. Everyone told me I\u2019d suffered a very serious and traumatic experience for a young man, that the event left scars on my psyche as well as my heart.\n\nI gave up trying to convince them.\n\nI slowly began to convince myself that what they\u2019d told me was true. I\u2019d simply imagined it. A death dream, as it were. The mind reckoning with its own imminent demise, trying to make sense of the experience.\n\nThen I met someone who claimed to have met God.\n\nThis was a few years later, when the author of a nonfiction book recounting their near death experience visited my hometown. (I won\u2019t reveal the author\u2019s name as I don\u2019t want to invite a lawsuit, which I\u2019m sure he\u2019d launch against me if he read that I\u2019d besmirched him.) I attended a reading and afterward confronted him about his tale.\u00a0\n\nI looked him in the eye and asked if he really met God \u2013 something I\u2019m sure he\u2019s dealt with hundreds of times. He smiled and nodded, assuring me that yes, God is real and is filled with love. On a lark, I decided to tell him that I knew the truth, that slavery awaits us all.\n\nA flicker in his gaze betrayed his knowledge of the fact. He really had died and visited the afterlife, but lied about it in his book.\n\nBecause he knew.\n\nHe knew the truth of heaven, the horrible place our souls are bound [for](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/JulianVoss\/)."},"282":{"title":"A Talking Crow Taught me to Fly","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/8qs8jv\/a_talking_crow_taught_me_to_fly\/","flair":null,"author":"lifeisstrangemetoo","selftext":"I used to look out the rusted iron bars of my window and dream about being a bird.\n\nThe chain that shackled me to my bed was just long enough to reach the windowsill, and so every night after my father would visit my room I would lie awake and wait for the first rays of light to creep over the horizon, then walk over to my window to listen to the morning\u2019s first few notes of birdsong.\n\nTheir melodies were so beautiful, I knew that they must have been singing about places far away and wonderful, about sailing on the wind through endless blue skies, looking down at the treetops that dotted the land below.\n\nThen, one morning as I lay in bed, something impossible happened. I had fallen asleep the night before, and would have missed my morning birdsong but for a tapping on my window. I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes and sat up to see a crow sitting outside on the sill, tapping my window with his beak.\n\nI crept over to the window and smiled at the bird.\n\n\u201cHello, Mr. Crow,\u201d\u00a0I said.\n\n\u201cHello little girl,\u201d\u00a0said the crow.\n\nI stood there dumbfounded for a moment, not knowing what to say. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, I forced myself to speak.\n\n\u201cYou know how to talk?\u201d\u00a0I said.\n\n\u201cAll birds know how to talk,\u201d\u00a0he replied. \u201cIt\u2019s just that not all humans know how to listen.\u201d\n\nI pushed my window open a crack until it hit against the bars. The bird cocked its head in curiosity.\n\n\u201cWhy are you in a cage?\u201d\u00a0it asked.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s my destiny,\u201d\u00a0I said. \u201cIt\u2019s always been this way.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look rather thin,\u201d\u00a0replied the crow. \u201cWould you like something to eat?\u201d\n\nMy stomach gave a weak growl.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d\u00a0I said. \u201cThat would be wonderful.\u201d\n\nWithout another word the crow took flight. A few minutes later he returned with a small branch of figs. The crow watched me as I greedily devoured the fruit. After I had finished he stared at me for a moment before speaking again.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know they put people in cages,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cDo you think they mistook you for a bird?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so Mr. Crow,\u201d\u00a0I said.\n\nWe whiled away the rest of that day talking. The crow told me all about what it was like to fly, how there was no better feeling in the world. He told me about the far away lands he had visited when he was a young bird and could still make the journey north with the changing of the seasons. Finally, evening came and the crow said that he had to go. The next morning he was back, however, with two more branches of figs.\n\nI thanked him for his generosity, and we talked another day away. That day he even sang me a song. He didn\u2019t have a voice for singing, but I thought his song was beautiful anyway.\n\nWe passed the entire fall that way, and the bird\u2019s visits became the only bright spot in my life. He brought me not only figs, but cherries and walnuts too\\-\\-anything small enough for him to carry.\n\nSoon, however, winter came, and with it the frosts that destroyed the figs and cherries that the crow had used to bring me. His gifts became fewer and fewer, and I could tell from his tired voice that he was flying farther and farther away to get them.\n\nOne morning, when the first snows of winter had fallen, the crow asked me a question.\n\n\u201cWhat would you do to leave this place?\u201d\u00a0he asked, cocking his head to the side.\n\nI thought for a moment, but I wasn\u2019t sure how to answer. Finally, I told the truth.\n\n\u201cI would do anything to leave this place,\u201d\u00a0I said. \u201cAnything at all.\u201d\n\nThe crow solemnly nodded and said, \u201cThe frost isn\u2019t the only thing that winter brings.\u201d\n\nHe flapped his wings once and jumped from the windowsill, and I didn\u2019t see him for three days. I began to fall into a deep depression. Every morning I would still listen to the birdsong, but it sounded forlorn and empty without my friend there to listen with me.\n\nThe morning after the third day my crow friend returned. It was so beautiful that day; the sun had come out from behind the clouds to melt the snow\\-\\-one of the last green days before winter came in earnest. As the shadow passed over the valley in which we lived, I first mistook it for a storm cloud, but then I heard the sound. It was loud enough to crack the sky, but it wasn\u2019t thunder\\-\\-it was birds.\n\nThousands upon thousands of them descended on our house. A whirling storm of beating wings and shrieking caws, they crashed into the walls and windows, pecking at them with wild ferocity. The house shook under their assault, and their calls were so loud that I didn\u2019t even hear the windows breaking.\n\nThey were not so loud, however, that I could not hear my father scream. It was over in a matter of minutes, and the key to my shackles slipped under the door. I rushed over and picked it up with trembling hands, sliding it into the metal cuff around my ankle and turning it.\n\nThe cuff came loose with a heavy click, and for the first time I was free.\n\nThe key to the door slipped under the jamb as well, and I opened the door to the rest of the house. The place had been all but destroyed. There was splintered wood and broken glass everywhere, and in the center of the living room was what remained of my father\\-\\-a pile of bloodstained feathers.\n\nThe birds had all flown off, but Mr. Crow sat on top of the living room fireplace, regarding me with a curious look.\n\n\u201cNow you can fly free, little girl,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cNo more cages for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, Mr. Crow,\u201d\u00a0I said. \u201cWill you come with me?\u201d\n\nMr. Crow shook his head.\n\n\u201cI am an old bird,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cAnd my journey is coming to a close. But yours is just beginning.\u201d\n\nMr. Crow flapped his wings and took flight, and I never saw him again. As I stepped out of the front door my bare feet touched the grass for the very first time, and I could smell the flowers on the breeze as it drifted over me.\n\nAt that moment, though my feet were firmly on the ground, my heart was soaring through endless blue sky, far above the world that I had left behind.\n\nI still wake up every morning to hear the birds sing, and when the first few notes break the silence of the early dawn, I think of Mr. Crow and smile.\n\n[x](http:\/\/facebook.com\/lifeisstrangemetoo)"},"283":{"title":"I\u2019m a Firewatcher.

Upon moving in to my station, I found the following pages typed on my desk. I am not the author of the following. I am transcribing exactly what I found, dated 1989:**\n\n---------------\n\n----\n\nI\u2019ve been located here for 185 days, according to my calendar. I\u2019m stationed up in the northwest of the United States with two other guys\u2014Clark and Thomas. \n\n185 days. That\u2019s five days longer than our stint here should\u2019ve been. Normally, they rotate us out every 180 days. We were supposed to be picked up by Helicopter 5 days ago.\n\nI started writing this logbook, journal, whatever, because we\u2019re overdue for evac. Or so we think. Maybe we messed up the calendar somehow.\n\nOur main radio stopped working on day 179.\n\n\u201cGet up! There\u2019s smoke.\u201d\n\nBleary-eyed, I saw Clark standing over my bunk. I could see the orange slits of light reflecting on his torso, signaling to me it was the early morning.\n\n\u201cTeddy! Smoke!\u201d\n\n\u201cSmoke? Huh?\u201d I said, still half-delirious.\n\n\u201cYes, smoke. A really small stream of it maybe a mile southeast.\u201d His eyes were wide and brighter than the sunlight on his uniform.\n\nI pulled myself out of the bottom bunk and headed towards the window. I didn\u2019t even need my binoculars to see the small sliver of smoke creating a shadow in the early sun\u2019s light. In 185 days, it\u2019s only the second time we\u2019ve seen a potential fire.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know what a fire watchtower looks like, it\u2019s basically a wooden cabin elevated about 100 feet in the air. Ours has a staircase that wraps around the structure beneath the cabin. I\u2019m pretty sure other towers use ladders, but that\u2019s beside the point.\n\nClark and I bunk up in the watch tower. We have a little kitchen, our bunk bed, and a 360-degree view of nothing but woods. Thomas sleeps in a tiny little cabin at the base of our tower, which is also where our main office is. \u2018Office\u2019 may be too loose of a term. It\u2019s one desk and a typewriter used for typing out reports of what we see out here.\n\nI rubbed my eyes and looked over to Clark, \u201calright, let\u2019s go check it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo way, Teddy. No way,\u201d he replied immediately.\n\nClark has been afraid to go past the outhouse since day 180 passed. He\u2019s afraid a helicopter will come, and he\u2019ll miss his chance to be rescued.\n\n\u2018Rescued\u2019 Clark would say. But are we in danger? Did we miscalculate the number of days we\u2019ve been out here? We still have plenty of food. Did they forget about us? Has the apocalypse come and gone and we don\u2019t know because we\u2019ve been isolated?\n\n\u201cOkay, fine,\u201d I agreed, \u201cRadio down to Thomas and let him know. He should be up.\u201d\n\nOur main radio back to base isn\u2019t getting a sign of life from anywhere. And if it isn\u2019t receiving from anywhere, we assume we aren\u2019t being heard from anywhere. Luckily, we still have our own walkie-talkies to communicate with each other.\n\nClark took out his walkie.\n\n\u201cTom, there\u2019s some smoke about a mile southeast. Can you go check it out?\u201d\n\nA few seconds passed before Thomas responded.\n\n\u201cAfter I finish wiping my ass I\u2019ll be on my way. Unless you wanna help me with that Clarky.\u201d\n\nThomas, the oldest of us, is always picking on Clark, the youngest. He doesn\u2019t really dislike Clark. He is just easy to pick on. He\u2019s a twenty-three-year-old college dropout. I think he studied accounting or finance or something on his parents\u2019 dime. I don\u2019t think he left college to be a professional firewatcher. No, I think he left to come out in the wilderness, be alone, and take a retrospective look at his life to decide what he really wants.\n\nYou only sign up for 180 days of isolation if you\u2019re crazy, or if you want to get away from something. I\u2019m not sure which category Thomas falls is. He\u2019s a cryptic, brute of a man. His picture is probably in the dictionary next to \u201clumberjack.\u201d He\u2019s pretty quiet unless he has a joke to tell or something important to say. Either way, when he opens his mouth, I listen.\n\nAs for me, it\u2019s not important why I\u2019m out here.\n\n\u201cHeaded out now,\u201d Thomas radioed. \n\nClark and I watched Thomas start his trek into the tree line until we could no longer see him.\n\nClark cocked his head towards mine.\n\n\u201cTeddy,\u201d he said to me, \u201cThomas has been acting... different. Weird.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t expect him to be so blunt. But I had noticed. I knew Clark had noticed, but this was the first time we spoke about it.\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to be bothered that we are stuck out here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t *know* if we are stuck out here. We could\u2019ve scratched off the dates wrong. You know\u2014we thought we didn\u2019t scratch the day off yet but we really did, so we accidentally scratch the next day too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess,\u201d Clark said softly. I knew what he was going to say next.\n\n\u201cAt night though\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShut it, Clark.\u201d\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon Teddy! It\u2019s fucked up. He\u2019s fine during the day and then just, just changes. Does he have some type\u2019a illness? It happened so sudden!\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe he does! So what if the guy goes out at night to stare at trees?\u201d\n\n\u201cTrees? Stare at trees?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know you\u2019ve seen it. He goes out near the tree line and stands there for a while looking out. Sometimes hours. Maybe he does have a screw loose, and maybe he shouldn\u2019t be out here. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best idea to bring it up to him when we are trapped here with him, especially if he *is* insane.\u201d\n\nSilence fell between us before Clark responded.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know he stares out at the forest,\u201d he said to me in a soft voice and eyes wider than when he woke me up this morning.\n\n\u201cOh\u2014wait, what? What were you going to say?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt\u2014At night,\u201d he stammered, \u201che comes up the stairs.\u201d\n\nI looked over to our half-open door leading out to the staircase, letting a cool breeze in.\n\n\u201cWh\u2014what do you\u2014what?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe comes up the stairs, and, and just, looks at us. Stares at us.\u201d\n\n------------\n\nThomas left to go check out the smoke about an hour ago. It seems to have vanished, so I figure he handled it. \n\nClark spends his days using our walkie talkies, trying every station possible to alert anyone nearby.\n\nI just watch the forest.\n\n---------------\n\nIt\u2019s 11:30 PM. Thomas isn\u2019t back. He left at about 7 AM. He hasn\u2019t answered his radio.\n\nTomorrow will be day 186. We do not know if Thomas is okay, and one of us will most likely have to check the woods tomorrow\u2014and since Clark is chicken-shit, it'll end up being me.\n\nMore disturbing though, is something Clark told me a few minutes ago\u2014the reason I went back to the office to type this.\n\nI was leaned back in my swivel chair, spinning slowly, making sure there were no lights or fires in the dark expanse of trees, and wondering where Thomas was. He must\u2019ve been hurt. Even if he was lost, he\u2019d reply on his walkie. We always answer our walkies. They\u2019re with us at all times, even when we are shitting or showering.\n\nClark stopped my chair mid-spin and mid-thought. Before I could protest, he spoke.\n\n\u201cListen. I need to tell you something I\u2019ve been thinking about recently. It\u2019s eating away at me.\u201d\n\nI wondered if it had to do with Thomas.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m all ears.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to sound crazy,\u201d he warned.\n\n\u201cI bet I\u2019ve heard crazier.\u201d\n\nHe took a long, yet stuttered inhale, then spoke. \u201cI don\u2019t remember coming out here.\u201d\n\nMy facial expression didn\u2019t change, and it looked like he was waiting for a reaction, so he repeated.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember coming out here. Do you? Do you remember applying for this job? Do you remember being interviewed? Or being flown out here?\u201d\n\nAt first, I was almost amused. \n\nThen as he asked those questions, I froze.\n\nI didn\u2019t remember.\n\nHe continued, \u201cYou know how I said I decided to leave college? Well, now that I\u2019m thinking about it harder, I don\u2019t know if I did. I mean I must have, right? To be out here? I must have. But all I can remember is my last day of class for the semester, and then I was here. I don\u2019t remember anything between coming home after class and meeting you and Thomas.\u201d\n\nI was listening, but it probably didn\u2019t show. I was still motionless.\n\nI couldn\u2019t remember.

As the years have gone by and I\u2019ve grown up, I\u2019ve realized that the story cannot possibly be true, yet I can\u2019t shake the feeling that it is.\n\nIt happened in Tokyo, in the subway station. I was standing with my father when I saw the demon, a monstrously tall and furry creature with leathery black wings and a snout like an anteater. I must have stared at him for close to ten minutes before he finally spoke, in a soft mutter that was clearly intended for his ears only.\n\n\u201cThis human is creeping me out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt almost looks like it\u2019s looking right at me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am looking right at you,\u201d I said.\n\nThe demon nearly jumped out of his skin. \u201cYou can see me?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cYes. Can\u2019t everybody?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot unless they\u2019re in the fifth dimension.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I in the fifth dimension?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYour mind must have slipped over here by mistake. What were you thinking about before you saw me?\u201d\n\nI thought for a moment, and then grinned.\n\n\u201cTrains.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, well trains are the link between our dimensions. I guess your mind must have just wandered over here. Either that or you\u2019re going crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope I\u2019m not going crazy,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cBeing crazy is a good thing in the fifth dimension,\u201d the demon replied.\n\nI laughed.\n\n\u201cDo you have subway lines in the fifth dimension?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he said. \u201cHow else would we get to work?\u201d\n\n\u201dYou\u2019ve got wings!\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYes, but who wants to fly? Taking the train is so much faster, and if I fly to work I\u2019m all sweaty when I get there.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what do you use your wings for?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cI put them over my head when it rains.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan I see?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d the demon said. My hair blew back as he swooped his enormous wings over his head.\n\nI laughed again.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re funny,\u201d I said.\n\nThe demon laughed too, but then his expression changed.\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou seem sad.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes.\u201d the demon replied, not looking at me but at something behind me. \u201cSay, would you like to see a magic trick?\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nThe demon reached up and tugged a big rainbow handkerchief out of his snout. He must have pulled out twenty feet before he ran out.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s funny.\u201d I laughed, but I stopped when I realized I wasn\u2019t holding my dad\u2019s hand anymore.\n\nI looked around and saw the subway station had disappeared, replaced by flowing green meadows that were full of old trains.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see the subway station anymore,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d said the demon. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s better to see what isn\u2019t there instead of what is.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes when I\u2019m bored or sad, my mind slips off to the third dimension, and I see people like you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d I laughed. \u201cCan you go to other dimensions, too?\u201d\n\nBut the demon didn\u2019t answer, he was looking up at the sky.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s starting to rain,\u201d he said, whooshing his wings up over his head.\n\nWarm droplets of rain hit my face. \n\n\u201cCan I get under your wings with you?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNot now,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go home.\u201d\n\nThe world began to shimmer and flow together like different shades of green and golden paint, spinning around faster and faster in circles. I started to feel a little sick, and I closed my eyes. The world stopped spinning, but warm droplets of water still fell on my face.\n\nI opened my eyes and saw my mom crying over me, but I didn\u2019t see my dad.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s dad?\u201d I asked her. \u201cDid he bring me home?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, darling,\u201d she said, although she didn\u2019t look at me when she said it. \u201cHe brought you home and then he had to go away.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d I replied. \u201cWhen will he be back?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said.\n\nMy dad never did come back, and it was years before I found out the truth: he had killed himself that day. That morning he had written a note to my mother explaining that he intended to bring me along and step in front of the train with me. My mother found it when she got home from work and called the police, but it was too late to stop my father. The witnesses say that just before he jumped I pulled away from his hand and ran off, fainting right after. But one of the witnesses, a little boy around my age, said that he saw something take my hand and lead me away from the speeding train.\n\nHe said it was a monstrously tall and furry creature, with leathery black wings and an anteater\u2019s snout.\n\n[x](http:\/\/Facebook.com\/lifeisstrangemetoo)"},"285":{"title":"I work at NASA. We made alien contact yesterday.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/c1wxxu\/i_work_at_nasa_we_made_alien_contact_yesterday\/","flair":"Series","author":"None","selftext":"Part 2 - https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/c521t1\/i_work_at_nasa_we_made_alien_contact_last_week\/\n\nI can't tell you who I am, and I can't tell you the name of the program, but what I can tell you is that if what they say is true, we're in trouble.\n\nNow, we didn't make contact in the way you would think we would. We didn't beam out an episode of The Office towards Andromeda and hear back from alien critics. And we definitely didn't meet them face to face. We found another way to communicate. Something, apparently ancient humans had figured out as well.\n\nThere are countless dilapidated ancient structures around the world, and some of them, not all, but some, were communication arrays. At least a handful on each continent. I'm sure you'll be able to think of a few after I describe what we did.\n\nWe've been working on this technology for a while. There has been a long standing theory that sound has a much larger part in the universe than just being random vibrations. That the universe is simply a bunch of vibrations and sound, and if you find a way to manipulate those vibrations properly, you could do things that seem impossible. We proved that yesterday. \n\nBy creating an extremely, extremely, EXTREMELY, precise echo chamber, and playing certain frequencies into it, at precisely the right volumes, and the exact right timings, we broke some sort of barrier.\n\nNothing really happened, visually at least. We had run countless tests like these with tiny, minute differences, and this one seemed pretty mundane. There was a slight unnatural thrumming, the glass between us and the echo chamber shook in regular intervals as if we were playing a bass heavy song too loudly. The first thing that tipped us off that something was happening was that once we turned the speakers off, the thrumming didn't stop. My three coworkers and I could all feel this thrumming in out chests still, kind of like being next to a very loud drum. We talked for a moment, before we all fell silent.\n\nThere was something else now. It wasn't a voice. It was, some sort of, intellegent vibration. I can't explain it. It was like a voice was inside my chest, but it wasn't speaking, I could just feel what it was saying. My cohorts and I debated on the exact wording afterwards, but we all agreed on the overall messages each time. \n\nLike I said, they weren't really talking, so I'll do my best to phrase it in ways that get across what they said, in the way they \"said\" it. \n\n\"Wooooaaaahhh, you guys are back?\" Is what I felt in my chest. My colleagues and I stared at each other in utter confusion. One of the spoke up. \"Hello?\" He asked hesitantly. There was a silence for a moment, before the thrumming spoke back. \"I think I have it set right now, say that again?\"\n\n\"Hello?\" I repeated back to it in place of the other scientist. \n\n\"Yep, there it is.\" He said quickly. \"You guys figured it out again! That's crazy!\" It exclaimed. This wasn't what I was thinking the first human\/alien conversation was going to go. I wasn't even sure that this was first contact at this point though. \"Who is this? What is this?\" I asked loudly into the open air of our control room.\n\n\"I'm not sure if I'm allowed to give you details like who we are, but, what this is, is the ultimate form of communication in our universe. Your ancestors figured it out briefly too.\" With some quick deduction on how it was wording things, I think each of us figured out what we were talking to was alien in origin around the same time.\n\n\"Where are you from?\" I asked. \"You have to be close.\" Hell, with the way we were talking back and forth, they had to be REALLY close. It takes communications to Mars a few minutes to get there, just because that's as fast as light is. If we were talking this quickly back and forth they basically had to be on Earth.\n\n\"I guess you wouldn't know. We didn't tell your ancestors. We didn't think they'd get it. Let me do some math real quick.\" It was about a minute before it spoke again. \"What you see as your observable universe, thats not the whole universe. Not even close. Multiply that by about 15, and thats about how far we are away. And theres a lot past that.\" \n\nWe all looked at each other. It was speaking utter bullshit to us now. That was impossible, we'd never be able to communicate, ever. Physically impossible. We explained that to the chest-voice, and we were met by an equal level of confusion. \"Why are you still using light as a yardstick?\" It asked incredulously. Suddenly, its voice grew slightly dire. \"You're still not advanced enough. You don't even know.\" \n\n\"Know what?\" One of my friends asked.\n\n\"You are dead center in the Life Abyss. There is no life on any planet around you, for more than ten of your observable universes around you in any direction. Its a universal mystery how you're even alive.\" It spoke grimly. Never in my life had I felt smaller, more insignificant and more alone. It continued. \n\n\"And there is a reason for that.\""},"286":{"title":"I just graduated from medical school, and my new hospital has some very strange rules","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/dj5fgp\/i_just_graduated_from_medical_school_and_my_new\/","flair":null,"author":"ByfelsDisciple","selftext":"You probably think that all doctors are filthy rich, because I sure as hell did in the beginning. Eight years and a fistful of premature gray hairs later, I\u2019m just a few hundred thousand dollars poorer than \u201cbroke.\u201d That would matter if I had a family to provide for, but the long hours in med school have led to an end of my last relationship and a countdown on the shelf life of my ovaries. \n\nI was in a \u201ctake what I can get and be grateful\u201d situation. \n\nSo when St. Francis Hospital in Charleston, West Virginia offered me a position, I packed my sad life into three bags and sought opportunity in the hills of Appalachia. Nineteen of us started in July, and thirteen have since dropped out. \n\nI like to think of myself as the rat that wouldn\u2019t drown.\n\nSome people broke inside after watching children die because they weren\u2019t good enough doctors quite yet (everyone has to be a rookie at some point). It\u2019s doubly hard when you have to inform the dead child\u2019s parents, who then beg you to tell them different news, or scream that they want to die and just please kill them with whatever drug takes away the pain.\n\nBut most of my incoming class couldn\u2019t handle the chief of medicine. \n\nDr. Vivian Scritt is, without a doubt, the biggest bitch I\u2019ve ever met. \n\nNow I know why.\n\n\u201cNineteen of you start today, and we\u2019ve got a pool going with bets on how long each of you will last,\u201d she told us on Day One. \u201cDon\u2019t feel any pressure, folks. I\u2019ve talked with each of you in private, and my expectations are very low.\u201d \n\nShe peered condescendingly over her thin spectacles, snorted, then turned around to walk away. \n\n\u201cYou should know when to follow me and when to stay away, because I\u2019m not going to waste time explaining what you should figure out on your own.\u201d\n\nWe gawked at one another, all feeling weak and small, then scampered after her. \n\nI was last in line, and felt out of place taking even that much.   \n \n\u201cYou should have the list of expectations for St. Francis,\u201d Dr. Scritt explained as she walked on, not bothering to look at us as she talked. \u201cI printed eighteen sets of rules so that you would have to challenge one another for them, knowing that one of you would be left behind.\u201d\n\nAn icy cold settled in the pit of my stomach as I saw everyone look down at a list of rules that only I did not have. \n\n\u201cIf you cannot follow these rules, there will be no place for you in this hospital. It most likely means that you are unsuited to be a doctor, and should consider a profession that demands a weaker mental aptitude.\u201d At that, she turned around to face us all. \u201cAnd if you think that I\u2019m the type to give second chances after a mistake, you\u2019re woefully underprepared for the world of medicine.\u201d She stopped and looked at each of us in turn, apparently expecting a response that no one dared to offer.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d she shot out in exasperation, \u201cwhy are you standing here? People are dying. Get to work!\u201d\n\n*\n\nNo one wanted to show me their list of rules, so I had to wait until one of my classmates died.\n\nIt took nearly a week. \n\nI was working at 3:00 a. m. because I had only been on the clock for ten hours. I was rushing into another room so that a patient wouldn\u2019t know I was Googling his symptoms (doctors do this FAR more than you realize) when I saw Myron by himself in an O. R. \n\nI stopped immediately. \u201cMyron?\u201d I squeaked. \u201cWhat the hell is that?\u201d \n\nHis arms were working furiously, but his back was turned toward me, so I couldn\u2019t see what he was doing.\n\nSomething felt wrong. \n\nMyron was the pick of our litter. He\u2019d been top ten in his class at John Hopkins, and he would remind us of that fact in exchange for answering the questions that we were too terrified to ask Dr. Scritt.\n\nSlowly, I approached Myron, not wanted to startle him. \u201cWe\u2019re really busy right now, is there something you need help with?\u201d\n\nHe showed no outward signs that he had heard me. Instead, he kept pumping away furiously at the task at hand. \n\nWhen I was five steps from him, I could see drops of blood flying over his shoulder. \n\nWhich made no sense, since he had been alone in the room.\n\n\u201cMyron?\u201d I whispered, barely loudly enough to hear my own words.\n\nI slowly crept around his left side, finally bringing the scene into full view.\n\nMyron\u2019s abdomen was split from sternum to pelvis. His esophagus spilled out, and his stomach sat on the table. A nest of quivering small intestine led from the bottom of his stomach back into his shredded torso. \n\nMyron showed no outward signs of pain.\n\nHe was too busy working.\n\nHe clutched his own stomach tightly in his left hand, the folds squirting through his fingers like unbaked bread. His right hand was working furiously with a scalpel, sawing his organ into ribbons. Rivers of sweat poured down his forehead with the intensity of the effort.\n\nI tried to scream, but it only came out as a moan.\n\nThat was enough to get Myron to notice me.\n\nSlowly, he raised his head. Slowly, he smiled.\n\nIt was not a happy smile.\n\nWith eye contact locked on me, he licked his lips, angrily stabbed a piece of his stomach, and lifted it to his mouth.\n\nHe bit.\n\nHe chewed.\n\nThen he lunged.\n\nBut most people don\u2019t know how to move with their innards splayed out for all the world to see, and this was his downfall. Myron\u2019s tattered guts caught on the corner of the table, and he fell to the floor. \n\nFinally, he screamed. \n\nI had learned very early in my medical career that compartmentalization is indispensible. That instinct took over my brain in the moment, and I acted clinically.\n\nMyron was still grasping his scalpel with his right hand. I kicked it \u2013 hard \u2013 and it flew out of his hands.\n\nHe stared at me and screeched.\n\nWith his entrails still wrapped around the table, I figured my best option was retreat. I moved to the back of the room as a doctor and a janitor burst in. \n\nAnd in possibly the most shocking moment of the night, I realized that they were *not* shocked. \n\nMyron was anesthetized, subdued, and extracted within a minute of their arrival. \n\nFor a moment, I was alone with a pool of blood and diced stomach lining. \n\nAnd something else.\n\nA sheet of paper lay on the floor, its corner just touching the edge of the creeping blood. \n\nMyron had dropped his list of rules. \n\nThe practical part of my brain continued to drive me. I snatched the paper from the ground, then quickly exited the room, taking care to avoid the puddle.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to leave any bloody footprints in my wake. \n\nI knew that I had to read the list as soon as I was able to find thirty uninterrupted seconds to myself. Three hours later, I had my opportunity and ducked into a janitor\u2019s closet. With a shaking, *exhausted* hand, I pulled the chain on a bare bulb, tried to ignore the noxious smell of leaking ammonia, and read.\n\n-------------\n\n**St. Francis Hospital Rules \u2013 Guidelines for new doctors**\n\n1 \u2013 Never, under any circumstances, share your copy of the rules with anyone else.\n\n2 \u2013 If any other doctor displays erratic behavior, leave the area immediately. Do not make eye contact.\n\n3 \u2013 If any other doctor is approached or detained by someone in a janitor\u2019s uniform, do not interfere. Never ask about that former doctor again. \n\n4 \u2013 Never touch any seemingly abandoned Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups. Those are Dr. Scritt\u2019s favorite candy.\n\n5 \u2013 Any child that dies in St. Francis hospital MUST be cremated within 120 minutes of official time of death. If you suspect this rule has been broken, alert Dr. Scritt, and the hospital will be evacuated. \n\n6 \u2013 There is no Children\u2019s Burn Unit at St. Francis hospital. If you find yourself there, continue walking until you return to familiar territory. This usually requires traveling in a straight line down the central hallway for 47 minutes. You will not reach a wall during that interval.\n\n7 \u2013 This rule is on a need-to-know basis.\n\n8 \u2013 A small quantity of sulfuric acid is kept in every room. This is ONLY intended for use on patients with severed spinal cords. If they attack, a hypodermic injection of H2SO4 into the cranium is the only way to subdue the subject. \n\n9 \u2013 The morgue must house at least 13 cadavers at all times.\n\n10 \u2013 If find yourself on the hospital roof with no memory of how you got there, you have only two choices. Either wait for an extraction team to find you, or jump four stories to the sidewalk on Court Street.\n\n11 \u2013 If you see Room 1913, do not look directly at the numbers. Do not open the door. This is, by far, the most important rule.\n\n---------------\n\nMy heart stopped when the door opened.\n\nDr. Scritt was staring at me. What little emotion shined through her exterior seemed to be surprise.\n\nWe both stood, frozen, for five seconds of agonized silence. \n\n\u201cDr. Afelis,\u201d she drawled gravely, \u201cI\u2019m shocked.\u201d She stared down at the bloodstained list of rules in my hand.\n\nI reached for words. *Any* words, because literally any response would make me look less guilty than I did in that moment, staring up at my boss\u2019s boss\u2019s boss and saying literally nothing in my defense as she weighed my soul with her eyes.\n\nAnd I said nothing. \n\n\u201cYou took a list that wasn\u2019t yours, and were nowhere to be found after your coworker experienced such an *unnatural* incident.\u201d Dr. Scritt huffed through her nose. \u201cIt seems that *you\u2019re* willing to do the unthinkable in the name of getting what you need. And *Myron* couldn\u2019t\u2019 even follow the most important rule.\u201d She clenched her teeth. \u201cI had a four-year streak of predicting which incoming doctors will break the soonest. This will *ruin* my chances in the office pool.\u201d\n\nThe ghost of a smile graced her lips before she turned to leave. \n\n\u201cGet to work, doctor. You\u2019ve got three hours left on your shift, and those symptoms aren\u2019t going to Google themselves.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t realize that I\u2019d been holding my breath until I heard my own gasp for air.\n\nShaking, I slowly emerged from the janitor\u2019s closet. I quickly stuffed the list of rules back into my pocket, reflecting on the fact that I had just achieved what *might* be considered an actual win.\n\nPerhaps, just maybe, I would keep my head above water at St. Francis after all. \n\nI turned to head down the hall when I stopped in my tracks. \n\nEverything was unfamiliar. What the hell had happened?\n\nI glanced all around. The design of the hallway was familiar, but everything was *off.* I could hear people talking in the rooms, but the immediate vicinity was devoid of all people but myself.\n\nNothing made sense.\n\nThen I looked up.\n\nAnd I\u2019ll be honest, I peed just a little when I read the sign.\n\n*ST.

It was a remarkable feat of engineering, this little beast; designed with such care that even the equipment on the hull could withstand more water pressure than the sea could muster up at any achievable depth. It was my Pegasus. My Trojan Horse; my very own *Apollo 11* - and inside this matrix of layered syntactic foam I would follow the ballasts to the gratuitous and unexplored depths of Higgin\u2019s Maw. \n\n\nI began the separation sequence, and the deep-diver fell away from the escort and dipped beneath the surface of the Pacific with silence and grace and a few knots of speed, and then I was consumed in a whole new world - albeit one I\u2019d frequented - that of the sea. Schools of fish swam on by me, and when their cloud passed through a sunbeam it glinted silver, and beneath them swam rays that rolled their wings to the beat of the current, and out in the rocks crawled the crustaceans and sat the plant life that spruced up all the white-washed stones there like holiday ornaments. But I had an appointment to keep, and the oxygen tank was a demanding clock, so I dove right on past the old reef and out into the open waters where the seabed couldn\u2019t be seen for many, many miles yet. \n\n\n*\u201dThe Maw,\u201d Reuben had said. \u201cFifty thousand feet below the surface, Booker. Fifty* thousand. *Do you know what that means?\u201d*\n\n\n*\u201dMeans its a whole hell of a lot deeper down than the Challenger Abyss.\u201d*\n\n\n*He\u2019d nodded at that. \u201cAre you ready to make history?\u201d*\n\n\nWas I? I thought I was. I\u2019d prepared for this lonely dive and nothing else, for some years now. It was the culmination of a lifetime of work and study in the field, and so tight was its grip on my mind that I often dreamt of it in my sleep; of what I\u2019d find at the bottom, and what it would mean. *And what monstrous things might take offense to my presence there.*\n\n\nNo. *No.* I shoved that thought aside. *Tuscany* was all the protection I needed in that regard; it offered technology on the bleeding edge in lieu of a heavy hull, and that was enough to withstand enough water pressure to crush bones beneath skin and inches of steel. What animal had jaws more powerful than the ocean itself at fathom?\n\n\nSo I hit the thrusters, and down I went, like a bullet to the pitch. I eyed the depth meter as much as I did the sea. One hundred feet. Two hundred. Sharks and turtles and uncountable fish swept past me. Three hundred feet. Five hundred feet. Seven hundred. A thousand. Twelve-fifty - *the inversed height of the Empire State building.* Fifteen hundred. Sixteen. \n\n\nThe water began to blur and grain up and darken as the sunlight struggled to push on through. Two thousand. Twenty five. Three thousand. Thirty two - *where the light no longer shines.* \n\n\nAnd soon all the light I had to spill glow to the path ahead and down, were the lights of the *Tuscany.*\n\n\nI continued the descent for hours. The pressure meter ticked up in spasmic bursts, but up it went, up, up, up, soon ticking past the point where the weight of the sea would\u2019ve crushed the steel of another vessel. One mile down. One point three. One point six - *where even Sperm Whales hit their lowest dive.* I could now claim with confidence that no mammal on earth was as deep down at that very moment as myself. And still I dove. Two miles. Two point one. Two point two. \n\n\nThe water was as black as space now, except for where the lights of the *Tuscany* pierced through it, and the thickness of the fluid made it look like ink or oil or some kind of alien sludge that smeared up against the reinforced windows and slimed its way across the hull. Things were tight down here, despite the vastness of it all, yet still I dove. \n\n\nThirteen thousand feet. *The Abyssal zone. Pressure stands at 11,000 psi.* I saw an Angler float by, and it was startled by the sheer volume of light spread by the *Tuscany* that dwarfed its own bioluminescent glow. It swam away, and I dove further. Fifteen thousand feet. Three miles. Three point one. \n\n\n*Now things get interesting.*\n\n\nMankind had visited these depths almost infrequently enough to count the expeditions on a single pair of hands. I was now ranked among an illustrious few explorers, and although I wasn\u2019t the first to hit these marks, I\u2019d hit the deepest one yet before this journey was over. I was determined and I was capable. So I checked the depth chart. *Sixteen thousand, two hundred eighty one point four feet.* Nearly halfway to the world record. The *Tuscany* continued its dive.\n\n\nTwenty thousand feet down. *The Hadal zone. Pressure here is eleven hundred times what it is at the surface.* Twenty two thousand feet. Twenty six. Twenty nine thousand - *The height of Mount Everest.* Thirty. Thirty point five. Thirty one - *the same distance from the surface as a commercial airliner at the peak of its flight.* \n\n\nThe Challenger Deep, what had previously been the lowest recorded place on the seabed, sat at roughly 36,000 feet below the surface, in the depths of the Mariana Trench. No light from the sun had ever come close, and to the best accounts life existed there, but only sparsely, and the pressure is unspeakable. \n\n\nBut I was going somewhere vastly deeper, even, than that. \n\n\n*\u201dAll we know is we found a canyon,\u201d Reuben had said. \u201cDwarfs the Grand - sitting dead center in the Pacific seabed. \u2018Bout twelve hundred kilometers west of Hawaii, and another nine hundred south, and, near as we can figure, some fifty thousand feet straight on down.\u201d*\n\n\nThirty six thousand feet. I was now tied for the world record. \n\n\n\u201c*Fifty thousand feet?! Why the hell are we just now seeing it?\u201d*\n\n\nThirty six five. I did it. My heartbeat swept up to a faster rhythm. I was officially a world record holder; no human being in recorded history had been as deep below the surface as I was at that very moment. \n\n\n*\u201cNew seabed scanning technology helped. Gave us a more detailed topographical map of the hydrosphere than we\u2019ve ever had before, and once we got back the results, we took a look, and there it was. Just waiting for us. Inviting us down.\u201d*\n\n\nThirty seven. \n\n\n*\u201dSo what\u2019s down there?*\n\n\nThirty seven three.\n\n\n*\u201dHell, Doctor. If we knew that we wouldn\u2019t be sending you, would we?\u201d* \n\n\nThirty seven nine.\n\n\n*\u201dI suppose not.\u201d*\n\n\nThirty eight.\n\n\nThirty eight five. \n\n\n---\n\n\n*The awful spirits of the deep*\n\n*Hold their communion there;*\n\n*And there are those for whom we weep,*\n\n*The young, the bright, the fair.*\n\n\nHiggin\u2019s Maw, according to the best information available to me at the time of departure, is a pit, roughly a full kilometer across. It begins at approximately forty six thousand feet below the surface and is estimated to bottom out at Higgin\u2019s Deep, a small valley that sits at its base, some five thousand additional feet below that. The Maw is the largest and deepest such formation in the hydrosphere, and yet its dimensions and location are the only things concretely known about it. That, of course, is where myself, and where the *Tuscany,* come in.\n\n\nForty three thousand feet down. I hit the floodlights underneath the *Tuscany,* and the glow washed over an alien landscape that likely hadn\u2019t seen light in over a billion years. There were mountains here - *mountains* - ones that rivaled the Alps, and wild arches and plateaus that stretched far off to a murky horizon before being shrouded by seawater. \n\n\nI even saw *life* down here in the depths. A squid-like thing of simply monstrous size swam on by my boat. It stopped for a moment, and during that moment I thought it might take offense to me, but after looking hard at the *Tuscany* and brushing a tentacle down the port side it swam off in search of other things. \n\n\n\u201cAtta girl.\u201d\n\n\nI descended further. \n\n\nForty four thousand feet. Forty five. \n\n\nAnd then, all of a sudden, there it was. *The Maw.*\n\n\nMy mouth hung by the jaw as the sheer scope of the beast came into view. It was a breathtaking sight to behold; a monstrously large and equally dark hole in the crust of the earth that plummeted to inconceivable fathoms. I descended a bit further - forty five five, forty six thousand feet - and *Tuscany* fell into its yawn. Somehow things were even blacker in the depths of the thing, even though sunlight had long since been blotted out. \n\n\nForty six five. Forty seven. Forty seven two.\n\n\nI began to become aware of a low current pulling me downward. It wasn\u2019t particularly powerful, but it was unexpected and it was therefore alarming. And yet I couldn\u2019t bear to pull myself back up. Not yet - *I\u2019ll turn around if it gets bad* - so down I went, deeper and deeper and deeper still into the cavern. \n\n\nForty eight thousand feet. Forty eight five. Forty nine. Forty nine one. \n\n\nAnd then I saw it. A glow. \n\n\nI squinted and dimmed my lights to confirm the intuition. *What in the name of God\u2026?* It was there indeed, a dim reddish-purple, then green, then purple again, and then blue, floating on a mist of current some few thousand feet down. I resumed the dive to chase it. Forty nine five. Forty nine seven. Forty nine nine. The glow, whatever it was, was getting deeper, and wider, and brighter. Soon it filled up the whole path down and ahead. I dimmed the *Tuscany\u2019s* under-lights to their lowest setting, and by fifty thousand feet I could see that the glow was coming from somewhere not directly beneath me, but off to the left and around a wide corner. \n\n\n*This cave isn\u2019t a straight pit.* And sure enough, the hole bottomed out here, and then opened up to its left. \n\n\n*Holy God. Holy* God.\n\n\nIt was a cavern chamber, at least a full kilometer up and deep and side to side and across, and only the enormity of its radius maintained the darkness of it despite the presence of thousands of floating bioluminescent pods that pulsed purple and green and blue and red and dimmed in the interim. I took the *Tuscany* in deeper, and her cameras whirred to life. \n\n\n---\n\n\n*Calmly the wearied seamen rest*\n\n*Beneath their own blue sea.*\n\n*The ocean solitudes are blest,*\n\n*For there is purity.*\n\n\nThe cavern became darker still when the pods faded into the water behind the ship. But there were more things to be seen here than rocks. *Tuscany,* about a quarter hour after entering the chamber, soon floated on by a bizarrely rope-like plant of utterly impossible size; one that appeared to stretch nearly across the height of the cave and grew wider at the base, although the bottom of it was shrouded in blackness. I took the submarine in for a closer inspection, and hit her lights to their fullest setting. \n\n\n*Clack.* \n\n\nMy heartbeat slammed. There were suction cups on it. Each one as big as the *Tuscany* herself, and they writhed and pulsed across and down the full length of what was now very clearly a *tentacle.* In a panic I shoved *Tuscany* back and away from the thing, but when I tried to turn her around, the base of the hull collided with the beast and stuck fast to one of the cups. I gunned the thrusters and could hear a wet tearing sound as the machine ripped itself free from the cup\u2019s grasp. \n\n\nBut then the tentacle came to life. It whipped and whirled and smacked around the cavern, and pressed itself to the roof, and then it fell down, deep beyond where the darkness blanketed the floor. \n\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, baby.\u201d I hit the thrusters again, and *Tuscany* rocketed off the way it came, through the darkness and off towards the pods, whose glow I hoped would afford me an opportunity to shut the lights off the ship and make my escape. \n\n\nIf I were so lucky. \n\n\nBut very soon I began to hear and *feel* the movement of something unspeakably *titanic* rolling across the floor of the chamber. It rumbled and thundered, and shuddered and shook, and soon clouds of dirt and rock flew up out of the black pitch and blanketed the view forward and I could hear boulders smack against the ceiling of the cave before sinking again to where they'd been. \n\n\n*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!*\n\n\n\u201cF-fuck!!\u201d The sound had erupted across the entire breadth of the cave at once. My eardrums nearly burst and likely would have, had it not been for muffling of the explosion provided by the walls of the *Tuscany.* The submarine shook, too, but she held up her integrity well enough to for me to fly on past the floating pods, some of which were now knocked about on their sides and rolling, and back towards the yawning mouth of the tunnel that would take me back out into the open deep s-\n\n\n*SMACK!!*\n\n\nThe *Tuscany* buckled and rolled with an impact. The Tentacle, I realized, had shot up from the ground and hit the bottom of the ship between her ballasts, but luckily it knocked her with force up towards the tunnel. I rolled *Tuscany* with the hit and managed to regain some control, and I boosted the thrusters into the turn and up again, now back into the Maw. Then I began to climb. \n\n\nFifty two thousand feet. Fifty one five. Fifty one. \n\n\n*\u201dSo what\u2019s down there?*\n\n\n\u201cCome on, baby. Come on. Don\u2019t you fail me now. Don\u2019t you *fucking* fail me now.\u201d\n\n\n*\u201dHell, Doctor. If we knew that we wouldn\u2019t be sending you, would we?\u201d* \n\n\nFifty point five. Fifty. Forty nine nine. Forty nine six. *Tuscany* ascended with panicked speed, and all the while she did it I could feel the rumbling of the Tentacle\u2019s pursuit in the walls of the Pit. It smashed its way on through the tunnel, and whipped and thrashed, but *Tuscany* was too quick a runner. *Forty seven five. Forty seven. Forty six eight. Forty six four. Forty six thousand feet and climbing high.* \n\n\n*\u201dI suppose not.\u201d*\n\n\n*Tuscany* burst out of the Maw and was about to rocket straight on back up to the surface, but then the Tentacle flew out beside her nearly smashed in her front window. I bent the controls to the edge of their set-casing, and *Tuscany* tanked to the left and up a bit and missed the ground by inches. I hit the lights again to navigate the labyrinth of rocks as I struggled to remount the climb. \n\n\nBut in the light of the ship I saw it; these weren\u2019t rocks after all - *they were other ships.* Massive vessels, Imperial warships from ages past, bent and crooked and broken at the bottom of the sea, pulled down here by whatever it was that now threw its back to my devouring. \n\n\nThe Tentacle smashed along behind me. Mainmasts and battlements and flat-decks and rusted iron and wooden boat hulls were splintered up and tossed to the winds of the sea, never again to reconvene. I took *Tuscany* through this nautical graveyard with far, far too much speed for my safety. Under ship towers we went, and through cannon mounts and past the blades of dead engines and around upended rudders. \n\n\nThe cacophony of my flight and the destructive path set by my hunter awoke the life in the place. Fish washed out of holes, and cabins, and captain\u2019s quarters and deep-deck stair flights and soon joined me in my effort to escape. \n\n\nBut it seemed there was no escape to be found here. The entire ground for countless miles shook and rumbled with seismic force. It was thunderously loud, and it picked up speed and violence with time. *Tuscany* finally flew up to miss a splintered crow's nest atop the mast by less than a foot, and finally used that directed momentum to put away distance between the seabed and herself with as many knots of speed as her thrusters would allow without bursting from the effort. The depth chart began to rise. \n\n\n*Forty five nine. Forty five two. Forty five thousand feet. Forty four eight.*\n\n\n\u201cCome on, you motherf-\u201d\n\n\n*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!*\n\n\nThe water itself seemed to shift with the sound. And then, out of nowhere, *Tuscany* was no longer the only thing spilling light to the Abyss; an orange glow flashed across the sea and for an instant illuminated nearly the entirety of its vastness. Then it blinked, and then flicked on again and stayed active. I shut off *Tuscany\u2019s* lights to preserve every molecule of power for the ascent. \n\n\n*Forty four two. Forty four. Forty three seven.*\n\n\nBeside me in the glow I could make out other creatures retreating, too. Ones of spectacular size, again, that mankind had never catalogued and that I, sadly, would not have time at all to study. There were city-bus sized manta ray shaped things, wrapped up in clouded wisps of transparent jelly, and even that squid the size of a building, all flying upwards in a mass panic. I led the charge. \n\n\n*Forty three one. Forty two eight. Forty two three. Forty two.*\n\n\n*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!*\n\n\nI looked behind me and down through the rear window. The Maw had moved. It was alive. *God almighty. I was in the Leviathan\u2019s throat. I was in its fucking throat!* I saw its Tentacle tongue lash out of the Maw and collect enough fish to feed a small town. *Tuscany* rocketed ever upwards as the Leviathan whipped even larger Tentacles behind it and gained speed with the force of a hurricane. \n\n\n*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!*\n\n\nThe Leviathan opened its Maw yet again and spewed forth its tentacle tongue, and with it it whipped up several Olympic swimming pools\u2019 worth of water into a gale-force maelstrom. The Mammoth Squid was caught in its fury, I saw, and then it vanished into the pit forever when the Maw snapped shut with a thunderous, echoing *snap.* \n\n\n*Tuscany,* meanwhile, continued to rocket upwards, and managed to escape the whirlpool by a foot. \n\n\n*Thirty nine five. Thirty nine. Thirty eight seven. Thirty eight two. Thirty eight thousand feet, and climbing.*\n\n\nBut the Leviathan pursued me relentlessly, riding on the flood of its own current. Its tentacles - each dozens of feet across and a mile long, beat the water back and tried to gain speed for their host. \n\n\n*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!*\n\n\n*Thirty seven five. Thirty seven. Thirty six four.* \n\n\n*Tuscany* had proved her worth with speed, and the pressure gauge now fell in jumps. It remained in the red and would for some time, but it was falling steadily, even as the depth chart rose. \n\n\n*Twenty nine thousand feet. Twenty eight three. Twenty seven five.*\n\n\n*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!*\n\n\nBut the Leviathan hadn't given up the chase. Not yet. I could *feel* it doubling its efforts. The displaced water rocked the *Tuscany* and she buckled and rolled in the synthetic current. Then I heard the Maw open up behind me and the water begin to whip and swirl itself into a frenzy by the oceanload. I punched the thrusters to breaking point. \n\n\n\u201cCome *on!!*\u201d The encasing syntactic foam was pressed to its limits; the reinforced glass began to chip every so very slightly, but the chips broke into cracks and those cracks began to crawl across the width of the windows. I checked the gauges. Twenty thousand feet. Nineteen eight. Nineteen four. Nineteen three. The ascent was slowing. *Come on, baby. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Please God. Be with me now. Be w-*\n\n\n*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!!!!*\n\n\nIn the orange glow of the Levianthan\u2019s eyes I could see how quickly the water was slipping by *Tuscany* and getting swept up into the maelstrom. The submarine began to sway port to starboard and shudder and shake. *Seventeen four. Seventeen thousand. Sixteen nine. Sixteen three. Sixteen one. Sixteen thousand.*\n\n\nI watched the gauge with a nauseating desperation. \n\n\n*Fifteen nine five. Fifteen nine two.*\n\n\nI could feel her slowing to a crawl. *Come on. Come on. Come on!*\n\n\n*Fifteen nine two five. Fifteen nine four. Fifteen nine six. \n\n\n\u201cShit!!\u201d And that was it; *Tuscany* was caught, and no sooner did the depth chart begin to slip then did I feel the whole submarine lose all sense of control and tumble backwards and around. I was thrown out of my seat and smacked my nose against the roof of the pilot sphere. Blood exploded, and it drenched my shirt and sprayed the glass and the entirety of the control set. \n\n\nI grabbed my face and began to apply pressure to slow the blood loss, but *Tuscany* again flipped ballast over ballast to starboard in the whirlpool and spilled me into the hatch ladder. I felt my shoulder dislocate and my kneecap smack into the bottom rung. My head swam, and still *Tuscany* tumbled backwards. The cracks on the windows spread faster. \n\n\n*Sixteen three. Sixteen four.*\n\n\nI could *smell* the inside of the Maw though the hull of the ship. \n\n\nBut then, all at once and not a moment too soon, I got an idea. It wasn\u2019t a particularly good one, but hell if it wasn\u2019t better than nothing - I managed to limp and tumble my way to the controls and grip the handles as the ship rolled. *Wait for it. Wait for it. Wait\u2026*\n\n\n*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!!!!*\n\n\n*Now!* The sound of the roar was so close every last control surface in the sphere rattled in its case. My eardrums rattled, too, but then I flared up the thrusters again, full blast and at an angle, and the *Tuscany* shuddered and flipped and shook and, with fortune, fell straight out of the maelstrom with inches to spare. I felt the edge of the Leviathan\u2019s Maw graze the starboard side, and the impact again sent me into the roof while the ship rolled end over end over end again. I smacked my ribs up on a dip in the alcove and fell back down into the seat, head first, and then out onto the floor. \n\n\n*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!*\n\n\nI managed to right myself with my good arm and get my bearings. I was free, but only just; the *Tuscany* banked and tumbled again and rolled, slower now in the absence of the whirlpool\u2019s flood current, but not yet in control of its pull. I tried to steer away, but it was useless; the ship flipped around the back of the Leviathan\u2019s titanic Maw and up over its head as the beast flew on by underneath me like a freight train. And for the first time since catching the monster\u2019s eye I began to fully appreciate the magnitude of its size. \n\n\nIt\u2019s back was an endless, snake like and sharp-finned spine the size of a minor mountain range, and only quick maneuvering moved *Tuscany* away from the jagged back fins that chugged up towards me and sliced open the sea itself. They missed me by feet, and the blast of the current they\u2019d swept up sent the submarine reeling backwards, off a bit further and into relative safety. \n\n\n*GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGHHHHH!!!!!!!*\n\n\nI quickly dimmed the lights to their lowest setting and caught my breath, as the full form of the Leviathan washed on past me. It stretched far away into the abyss below, for well over a mile, and dragging away behind it were thousands upon thousands of tentacles, a forest of the things, each the size of a six lane highway and tipped with razor sharp hooks and a flurry of wing-fins. It took a full three minutes for the beast to pass by me fully. And then it curved around in the other direction, and swam off in search of other things to devour. \n\n\n*Gggggggrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuuuuuggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!*\n\n\nThe form soon slipped away into a shadow. And then it was gone. \n\n\n---\n\n\nI surfaced hours later, having allowing the battered *Tuscany* to take its time with the journey. She was solely responsible for my escape - my quick thinking be damned. *A marvel of engineering indeed.* \n\n\nOnce I did break the surface I disbursed a distress beacon and then promptly collapsed from exhaustion. Evidently, I was picked up by the Coast Guard some hours after that, a few hundred miles southwest of Hawaii, and pulled from the near-wreckage of my submarine and taken to a hospital on the mainland. It was there that I woke up a full day later. \n\n\nAs I recovered I heard some isolated chatter of tremendous seismic activity near where I\u2019d been, and how the whole ocean floor had changed and moved and shifted form. But I couldn't care less. I told the bastards what I knew. And on top of that, they have the *Tuscany* and they have all the recorded evidence, and you now have this written account. What everyone does with this information now, is entirely up to them. \n\n\nAll I know is that I won't be doing any more diving any time soon. I\u2019ve come to a realization: that mankind has more than enough space to expand throughout and live upon and thrive in above and near the surface, and on land, and in the skies and soon, hopefully, out there amongst the stars. \n\n\nBut there are things in the sea that hold ownership of the deep. And perhaps it's best to leave it that way.

It\u2019s called Lucky\u2019s, which is a little ironic because if you\u2019ve ended up here you\u2019re anything but. If you stay too long the dust settles. Working at Lucky\u2019s you never see the same licence plates twice, or faces for that matter. I\u2019ve lost count of the amount of times the answer to my \u201cWhere you heading?\u201d has been \u201cAnywhere but back.\u201d The lights flicker more often than not, and the jukebox sometimes spits out songs that aren't on the index cards, but the coffee\u2019s hot, and most people who try them say the pancakes are the best they\u2019ll ever have, and I\u2019m inclined to agree. \n\nThe embroidered name tag on my uniform reads Isabella, but that ain\u2019t even close to my real name. It was my mom's. Lucky\u2019s has been here a long time. I wear it because I like hearing her name said by other people. It\u2019s like she\u2019s still here, still coming up in conversation. Like she might walk through the door any second and isn\u2019t buried in the cemetery just past the strip club. \n\nLucky\u2019s is also always open. Always. Working long shifts serving drifters and truckers and runaways, those who have become impermanent out on the highways, you get to know how to read people pretty quick. When you move around that much, always on the road, you leave parts of yourself behind sometimes, lost between the miles. Sometimes, people are just driving because there\u2019s nothing else left to do. Working at Lucky\u2019s I\u2019ve seen all sorts of lost things. \n\nI once saw a man hit a deer with his truck and pull over to bury it in the red dirt, digging as the sun went down, tears a steady flow down his face as he fought the ground to cover up what he had done. I once had a man I recognised from the news leave me a blood stained $20 as a tip, sad-eyed in a denim jacket that barely hid the gun taped to his ribs. I once saw a one-armed girl no more than sixteen stand up on the roof of her car and sing, until a coyote came and sat in front of the hood, howling along. I once saw two women fistfight in the parking lot in the night outside, until one was spitting blood and teeth and then they kissed in the blue lights of the police car that happened to pass them by, faces lit up red and shining. \n\nI\u2019ve seen the highway on fire, lines of flames between tires as the asphalt set itself alight in the heat. I\u2019ve seen roadside baptisms, preacher pulled up with a van and a kiddie pool. I\u2019ve seen things walking out in the desert just beyond reach of the neon sign for the motel that don\u2019t look quite like people, shifting out in the blue night. I met a woman who showed me a photograph of the place she was buried. I often meet people who you talk with a while until their faces start to flicker, can\u2019t quite hold up the pretence that long. I\u2019ve met people who have to be invited inside, before they can cross the threshold. I\u2019ve met some lovely members of a sacrificial cult who tipped well and were oh so polite, even when they asked me if I\u2019d consider letting them harvest me. \n\nBut this is a story about - well, you read the title. \n\nIt was a Friday and I was working a night shift. I prefer nights, because when I drive home I can pretend for a while that I\u2019m going to follow the taillights of the car in front until I leave everything in my rearview mirror, until it gets light and the desert changes to ocean, like if I rolled my windows all the way down I\u2019d taste salt on the air. That, and I\u2019m one of the only waitresses, shall we say, qualified, to deal with the night customers. Besides, tips are always better when the moon is out. We only have three true regulars in Lucky\u2019s, and only two had showed so far. \n\nRose-Marie, our first and most frequent regular, was sat by the window in her brown fur coat, always drawn about her shoulders come rain or shine. Not that it ever rained here. Her hair was long and white down her back, like the moon through a glass. She waved over to me, gracing me with a wink that made her crows feet deepen, all the more beautiful for it. Rose-Marie liked whiskey in her tea. Sometimes, she fed cake crumbs to the voodoo dolls she carried in her pockets. She was also a chronic insomniac and liked the company of Lucky\u2019s when sleep was hiding from her. \n\nShe continued to shuffle through the deck of cards she had already set up on the table top. I watched her thumbs flipping over two jokers. Rose-Marie liked to divine the future, when she had the time. She used a frayed pack of hotel playing cards, and if she was in a good mood she\u2019d read your coffee grounds. I didn\u2019t ask her too much, because those coffee grounds had a startling way of coming true. \n\nTable 6 was empty, and spotless as usual. It was the only table without a salt shaker, and the only one I never placed cutlery on. Only one person ever sat there.\n\nOur second regular, Jones, was sat in his usual booth, dregs of his black coffee held tight between his hands, badge resting on the table. He had his eyes closed, head bent down like he was repenting, steam curling off the lip of the mug and wrapping round his fingers. Jones was my favourite of our customers, not that I\u2019d ever tell him. I walked past the booth and slid a bowl of sugar packets along the tabletop until it hit the mug with a soft clink. He jumped, reaching for his holster out of habit, until his eyes focused and he saw me.\n\nHe smiled, embarrassed, and it changed his face, dragging him back to life. When he smiled it was like a storm in a drought, made you want to stand and watch, and maybe stay out in it just a while longer. I wanted to put my hands over his where they had resumed their place on the mug, to feel the second hand heat through his palms. \n\nSometimes I can sense the sad in people just by the feel of their skin. They carry it around with them, bone deep, trying to hide it from the world. But sometimes you can lift it from them for a minute or two, if you have enough kindness spare. It doesn\u2019t take much, most times. Jones was too young to be that sad. And yet. \n\n\u201cTired today?\u201d I gestured with the coffee pot to his half empty cup. Everyone knew about the little girl he\u2019d pulled from the dumpsters outside the swimming pool last week. She was the fifth one missing in three months. I could tell from the shadows like purple thumb prints beneath his eyes he\u2019d been dreaming about her. She\u2019d been found without her shoes on. He\u2019d carried her to the ambulance in her socks, pink with little daisies on \u2018em, small in his arms like she was asleep.  \n\nLou the fry cook had cried when I\u2019d told him that the other day. I really liked Lou. He was almost too big to fit through the service door, and had a tattoo of his dog just below the one of the angel of death on his shoulder. Lou sheds a tear for most things. The dead racoons we\u2019re always finding by the backdoor with their hands missing. Whenever there\u2019s a new missing poster plastered over the cracked glass of the phone booth in the parking lot. Every time he hears I Will Forever Hate Roses when it decides to pop up on the jukebox. Big guy, bigger heart. \n\n\u201cAlways tired,\u201d Jones said as I poured. Another girl had gone missing yesterday. As I poured, I made sure to brush his thumb where it rested on the cup handle with the inside of my wrist, lifting out that sadness as far as I could. He smiled up at me, shy, and I smiled back before I could stop myself. \n\nI walked on to the next booth, two truckers with faces that had seen too much sun. One was showing the other the photos of his new baby in his wallet. He had tobacco stained teeth, a scab on his cheek and wind-chapped lips - and his smile was the most beautiful damn thing as he talked about his kid, lit up like christmas morning. He showed me too as I refilled his coffee, and I stayed and talked to them a while. \n\nThe other trucker, with gold back teeth, told me how he\u2019d used to drive pigs, but couldn't handle the guilt when he handed them over to the slaughterhouse. Said he\u2019d look right into their pink faces through the slats and their eyes looked right back, bright and pleading like they knew what he\u2019d done. Said he still dreamt about them. Now he drove freezers of seafood, specialty deliveries for fancy hotels. He\u2019d never seen the ocean. \n\nLou slammed the bell from the depths of the kitchen and I got back to work, taking orders from a woman with a Labrador who ordered hot dogs for them both, and three teenage boys in their blood-stained varsity jackets in the corner, who had ten dollars between them and asked for as many waffles as they could get. \n\nThey often came in on full moons, leaving their bikes chained up in the parking lot. They were always hunting something, with their baseball bats, backpacks filled with bullets and their daddies\u2019 guns, but they were nice kids so I always gave them extra scoops of ice-cream. Besides, I knew they needed the energy, because when they were hunting they had to run fast. Real fast. There used to be four of them. \n\nI cleared the table from the two women at the next booth on my way back. They looked to be twins, both dressed in long silk skirts and hiking boots, red hair piled up messy on top of their heads. \n\nNeither acknowledged me, not out of rudeness but because they were too preoccupied, packing up their bags, overspilling with maps and notebooks. I spied a roll of duct tape and a bottle of vodka in there too, along with some stakes and crucifixes. They were deep in conversation, waving their hands and I caught a little of it as I stacked their empty glasses, lipsticked round the rims. \n\n\u201cI know where I buried him Sylvia-,\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know jackshit! We dug for hours, and-\u201d\n\nMy mom always taught me eavesdropping was rude, so I left them to it and headed into the kitchen. But I got the sense that wherever they had left, whoever he was, he certainly wasn\u2019t there no more. I felt like telling them, but like my mom said, it\u2019s not polite to listen to other people\u2019s conversations. You never know what you\u2019ll wish you hadn\u2019t heard. \n\nLou was dancing to the radio, swaying his hips to Sugar Hill as Dolly sang down the wires. He waved at me with the spatula he was using as a microphone. \n\nCarlos handed me a plate of pancakes. \n\nCarlos had worked here so long he\u2019d known my Mom, and was the only one who new my real name. He sometimes came with me on the weekends to change the flowers on her grave. He always brought her desert flowers, growing from the same earth she was. Carlos was also the only one who knew the recipe for the Lucky\u2019s pancakes, and the only one that could cook them right. On days when he wasn\u2019t working, we had no pancakes. Simple as. That was just the way it went. I\u2019d learnt that the hard way, but that\u2019s another story. \n\nAlong with the pancakes, came a warning. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s back.\u201d He gestured through the doors. \u201cTable 6.\u201d \n\nOur final regular had showed. It had been a while since he\u2019d been around. I hadn\u2019t even seen him come in, but that wasn\u2019t unusual. He moved in mysterious ways. I raised an eyebrow. Shit. Carlos raised one back. Oh shit. He tossed me the salt with a grimace, and I filled the pockets of my apron. Lou banged around in one of the staff lockers for a moment, until he emerged triumphant, waving a bible that had definitely seen better days. He placed in on the counter next to the syrup jugs and flipped to a random page. \n\nWe leant over his huge shoulders to read what it said. \u201cKeep far from a false charge, and do not kill the innocent and righteous, for I will not acquit the wicked.\u201d Lou shrugged and patted me on the shoulder.\n\nI don\u2019t get paid enough for this shit. \n\nI took the pancakes to table 6, which had been empty the last time I\u2019d looked. It was now very much occupied. The man sat at table 6 was smiling as I walked over. If you could call it a smile. It was more like rictus, lips straining deep red at the corners of his face. His eyes kept darting from side to side, too fast to count, like his pupils couldn't make up their mind where they should be. His hands shook as I got closer, hovering like flies on a carcass.  \n\nI tried to lean as far away from him as I could as I placed the plate on the tabletop, but as I pulled my hands away he darted his neck out fast, whipping his head up and tilting his face towards me. He sniffed in, hard, eyelids fluttering. He giggled, shrill like it was stuck on the roof of his mouth. I recoiled, trying to hide the urge I had to run back to the kitchen. There\u2019s something about hearing a grown man giggle that makes the skin crawl. \n\n\u201cCan I get you anything?\u201d I asked, faking bright. \n\n\u201cI\u2019d take your name.\u201d He gripped one of the pancakes in his fist, turning it to mush. \n\nI tapped the name tag on my uniform. He shook his head, grinning, shoulders almost vibrating with this strange fluid roll as his smile slipped for a second, front teeth jutting suddenly, tongue sharply poking out. Filth was caked under his nails, red like the dirt on the sides of the road. Then he was smiling again, swaying slowly from side to side, feral, in his hunting jacket. His hair hung in greasy strings around his ears, like blonde rattails, and they swung with him, back and forth. \n\n\u201cIsabella, Isabella, Isabella. It don\u2019t suit.\u201d He suddenly slammed his hand up to his face, shovelling the crushed pancake into the gaping hole of his wide mouth. I jerked back, the movement was so sudden. I shoved my hands into my apron, reaching for the salt, and his eyes narrowed. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that,\u201d came a voice from behind me. It rolled across my shoulders, deep, to the bone. Mr Prince. \n\nI turned to face our third regular, relief mixing with fear in a swirling pit in my chest. Kinda like that feeling you get at a fairground in midsummer, when you\u2019ve been on a carousel too long, and part of you knows you need to get off, but the other part doesn\u2019t want to leave because you know as soon as you stand still you\u2019re gonna be sick. Mr. Prince had that effect on people. \n\nMr. Prince was dressed, as always, in his black pinstripe. His stetson was darker than the night outside, and his boots shone like they were wet. If you didn\u2019t notice the upside down crucifixes embroidered daintily onto his custom lapels, you\u2019d think he was just a man with money, maybe mixed up in something a little shady, like oil, or pharmaceuticals. He was handsome by the way of his jaw, with his bone white smile, but his black sunglasses were balanced on the bridge of his nose, silver rimmed and gleaming, hiding his eyes as usual. When he spoke it was a drawl, dragged up from the depths of the South. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for my\u2026 acquaintance. He\u2019s a little\u2026\u201d Mr Prince glanced at the man sat at table 6 as he panted with his tongue hung out, like a dog. \u201c\u2026over excited.\u201d Mr Prince sat down and the lights above the booth flickered. He tilted his hat back on his head and the jukebox coughed and skipped, and suddenly Robert Johnson was on and singing about that damn crossroad again. Mr Prince popped a Marlboro Red between his teeth, and pushed the window open a sliver with the knuckles of his left hand. The silver pentagram ring on his wedding finger clacked against the glass.  \n\nMr. Prince smiled, the way snakes do when they\u2019re watching you from the grass on their bellies. The cigarette was now smoking between his teeth, although he hadn\u2019t moved. \n\n\u201cBesides, Leroy ain\u2019t the type for salt. He\u2019s just a man.\u201d He looked him up and down and his top lip curled. \u201cBarely.\u201d He turned to Leroy. \u201cI see you started on my pancakes. But what\u2019s the point of good food if it ain\u2019t for sharing.\u201d Leroy giggled that strange high sound that made me want to run, and shook a little. Everything about Leroy made me nervous, fight or flight getting ready to flood my system. \n\nMr Prince handed Leroy a menu. \u201cOrder whatever you want.\u201d He leant forward and the lights flickered.\n\nLeroy ordered four cheeseburgers, and glass of milk. \u201cWell, if that\u2019s all!\u201d I managed. I could feel Leroy\u2019s eyes clinging to my back as I left. Rose-Marie waved me over before I could get back to the safety of the kitchen. \n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about him, darlin\u2019.\u201d She crossed herself, and tapped the card on top of the pile. The Jack of Spades. It had its eyes scratched out. But not by Rose-Marie. It looked like it had been printed that way for years. \u201cWe won\u2019t be seeing him again.\u201d She wasn\u2019t talking about Mr. Prince. She cupped my cheek and I leant into it, her hand rough with age, but warm. I could tell she thought I looked tired. She paid for her tea and toast, and walked out into the warm night waiting outside the doors.  \n\nI finally made it back into the kitchen and was immediately attacked. Cold water doused me in the face and I threw up my arms on instinct, trying to protect my hair. Lou aggressively squirted me in the face with the spray bottle we also kept in the staff locker, the kind you use for tending house plants. Ours was filled with holy water. \n\n\u201cLou! Jesus fuckin\u2019 Christ, get off I\u2019m-\u201c I sputtered, and he sprayed me again. I spat holy water out, dripping down the front of my dress and wiped it from my eyes, makeup running a little. I grabbed the bottle from his hands. \u201cI think I\u2019m good.\u201d I wasn\u2019t really mad though, better safe than sorry, especially when it comes to possession. \n\n\u201cSorry! Just checkin\u2019.\u201d Lou sheepishly handed me a dish towel. \u201cAlready did me \u2019n\u2019 Carlos.\u201d He looked down at his shoes, awkward. He was a foot taller than me and a decade older, and I hid my smile because he was twisting the toe of his boot back and forth like a little kid been kept after class.\n\nCarlos kept his eyes firmly fixed on his hands as he started flipping patties, but I could sense him holding back a laugh, desperately clenching his teeth. I narrowed my eyes and aimed the spray bottle at him. \u201cMaybe you need some more,\u201d I threatened. Lou snorted and then Carlos was laughing and I was too, and that heavy feeling that had hovered over us since Mr. Prince had walked in lifted. \n\nSometimes when things get too dark, all you can do is laugh. Mom always said that when shit gets rough, you can either choose to laugh or cry. I never saw my mother cry.\n\nIt was coming up on 3 in the morning as I took the burgers back to table 6. Leroy visibly drooled and clapped his hands as I walked over. I put the plate in front of him as quick as I could but as I pulled back, his head darted forward and he licked the inside of my wrist. His tongue was long and wet against my pulse. I recoiled like I\u2019d been bitten and he laughed, shrill and manic. \n\n\u201cYou taste better than they will,\u201d he said, grinning and gesturing to the burgers. Mr. Prince watched this unfold, calm and unreadable like the sky before summer lighting burns down a tree. I frantically wiped my arm on my apron, but I could still feel that tongue on my skin as if I\u2019d left my hand in his mouth. I fought off the tears that suddenly burned at the corners of my eyes, because something told me Leroy would enjoy them just a little too much. I shuddered, and cleared Mr. Prince\u2019s plate.\n\n\u201cTell Carlos the pancakes were\u2026 good as hell,\u201d he said, from behind his sunglasses. Then he chuckled, low and raspy, as if something he\u2019d said was funny. He popped another Marlbro between his teeth and it started to glow, as Leroy shovelled meat down his throat. I tried not to gag as I watched it clog beneath his long nails.\n\nI walked by Jones on my way back. He waved me over, eyes creased with worry. He ran a hand over his face, as if he was trying to wipe all the bad things away.\n\n\u201cIs he botherin\u2019 you?\u201d He gestured over to Leroy who was rocking back and forth drinking his milk. Jones suddenly looked so tired, uniform creased as his face, looking fifty instead of his twenty two.\n\u201cNothing I can\u2019t handle,\u201d I shook my head and thought about Rose-Marie. \u201cWe won\u2019t be seeing him again.\u201d \n\nIt felt like hours waiting for Leroy to finish. I took the order of a man with a butterfly tattooed on his neck, and some truckers pouring Jim Beam into their coffee. They asked me for an extra cup which they placed at the empty seat on their table, for absent friends, they said. I cleaned down the counter top, restocked the sugar packets, and took out the trash, ignoring the man in the rabbit mask that often waits out by the dumpsters. As long as you don\u2019t look at him, he doesn\u2019t bother you. I refilled coffee cups, and took the orders of the large group of biker girls that came in, leather clad and road weary. \n\nAt 3:03am, Mr. Prince stood. Leroy had licked his plate clean and was sitting still, staring up at him with his teeth bared in a smile, hands gripping the table top so hard his knuckles were going white as milk. Mr. Prince handed me a roll of bills wrapped in black plastic that I knew better than to count. He tipped his hat. \n\n\u201cSee Leroy. We all gotta pay eventually,\u201d he said. He leaned in and spoke softly. \u201cFor I will not acquit the wicked,\u201d he smiled. He held out his hand to Leroy, palm flat, waiting. Leroy\u2019s hands shook as he reached into his hunting jacket and pulled out a pair of shoes. A child\u2019s shoes, small enough that both could fit in one hand. Little pink sneakers, dirty, with brown stains on the toes that I knew could only be one thing. Mr Prince considered them a moment, under the lights, and shook his head. \n\nHe seemed like he was sorry, before he handed them to me. \u201cFor your man over there. Tell him to dig deeper where they looked last.\u201d  He nodded to Jones, who was watching us, his badge gripped in his hand. But Jones knew better than to come over. \n\nMr. Prince turned to Leroy and grinned around his cigarette. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a ways to go, the road we\u2019re takin\u2019. They say it\u2019s paved with good intentions.\u201d He chuckled, and I felt sick to my stomach. He took Leroy\u2019s hand, like a child, and they walked out into the night, warm and waiting. The doors swung shut behind them, even though nobody had touched them. The jukebox sputtered, and Chris Rea was on, singing about that road again. \n\nI placed the shoes on the table by Jone\u2019s empty coffee cup, and passed on the message. He sat still for a long time after, just watching them on the table top, trying not to cry or scream or punch a hole in the plaster. All I could do was refill his coffee, because when someone is trying to hold themselves together like that, there\u2019s nothing left to say. \n\nMy shift ended, and I drove myself home, following the taillights in front of me. I knew when I woke up it would be dark, and it would be time for my next shift, but for now, I just drove, dreaming about the ocean and watching the sun come up, like it always does, despite everything."},"289":{"title":"I\u2019ve Been Flying for almost Thirty Hours and The Flight Attendants Won\u2019t Stop Crying [Part 3]","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/dmyq8g\/ive_been_flying_for_almost_thirty_hours_and_the\/","flair":"Series","author":"Worchester_St","selftext":"[Read Part 1 Here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/dlk100\/ive_been_flying_for_almost_thirty_hours_and_the\/?st=k269q0gn&sh=f6440917)\n\n[Read Part 2 Here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/dm86h5\/ive_been_flying_for_almost_thirty_hours_and_the\/?st=k269q1qh&sh=b655a8d9)\n\nAfter another dozen hours or so, I opened the bathroom door. The lights in the cabin were back to normal and I couldn\u2019t smell any sulfur. \n\nI cautiously made my way back to my seat and almost cried when the grinning crying flight attendant came by offering a meal. That crappy airline food was the most delicious thing I\u2019d ever eaten. \n\nWhen I\u2019d finished, my mind immediately turned to Mary. What had happened to her?\n\nI crept down the aisle towards first class, trying to keep a low profile. Surprisingly, the flight attendants were nowhere to be seen. They\u2019d almost seemed to ignore me, almost as if they wanted me to find her.\n\nShe had a row to herself and was staring down at her phone in the window seat. I slid into the aisle and shook her arm. \n\n\u201cMary!\u201d I hissed.\n\nShe pulled out her headphones and stared at me with a surprised expression. \u201cYeah? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you ok?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat did that thing do to you? What did they do to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, remind me how I know you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean? We just-\u201d I realized with sinking horror that she had no idea who I was. I fought back tears. \u201cMary, how long have you been on this flight?\u201d\n\nShe checked the watch on her wrist. \u201cWell it\u2019s 4:03 AM so a few hours at least.\u201d She stared at me the same way you\u2019d look at a person claiming they were the second coming of Christ. Her tone was low and reassuring. \u201cHey, don\u2019t worry so much. Look on the bright side; we\u2019ll be landing in about an hour.\u201d\n\nI felt an iron grip on my arm and looked up to see two flight attendants. \u201cSir, this area is for first-class passengers only.\u201d \n\nThey were still crying and grinning, but just with tears this time. I could still see streaks of blood staining the front of their uniforms though. \n\nI was escorted back to my seat where I spent the next several days. Attendants continued to stop by with food, I would use the bathroom, and soon was going absolutely crazy with the monotony. \n\nIn retrospect, those few days weren\u2019t so bad. There\u2019s a lot of content on the internet after all, even with crappy plane WiFi. No, it didn\u2019t get really bad until around ten days later when the WiFi failed.\n\nIt was sometime a week later that I lost control and began screaming for a flight attendant. They didn\u2019t come for several minutes, but eventually one did.\n\n\u201cJust...just let me see the Captain,\u201d I asked.\n\nThe flight attendant bent low and spoke with that same customer-service voice: \u201cI\u2019m sorry sir, the captain has made his decision regarding you quite clear. You didn\u2019t answer his call, and will, therefore, wait.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long?\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite a while I\u2019m afraid. Don\u2019t worry though sir, we\u2019ll be landing in about an hour.\u201d She straightened and walked away.\n\nI started making notches on various parts of the seatback to keep track of different things. One notch for each time I used the bathroom, one for each meal, one for every time I watched a given movie, that sort of thing. \n\nIt was hell. I watched every movie in the seatback a dozen times over. If I ever acted out badly enough, I would be escorted back to my seat by one or more flight attendants. Any attempt at conversation with other passengers was met with confusion by them followed by a quick escort back to my seat.\n\nI\u2019d guess it was on or around day thirty that, in a moment of panic and psychosis, I broke my laptop and phone, screaming at the top of my lungs. No one around me reacted in any way. \n\nTwo months later, I stunk. The muscles in my legs were tight and cramped constantly. I finally concluded that suicide was my only option after my hundred-and-twenty-eight rewatch of Thor Ragnarok. \n\nI got to my feet and limped towards the emergency exit. I knew normally the pressure inside the airplane forced the doors closed, but I figured that nothing about my situation was normal. If this didn\u2019t work, I\u2019d find some other more painful way to go. \n\nI grabbed at the handle and swung it up. To my shock, the door opened easily, though no wind of any kind whipped around the cabin. It remained the standard slightly-too-cold temperature that it\u2019d been for the past who-knew how long. \n\nThe open door called to me, a black portal out of the plane. I stared at it for a long moment, almost too long. An attendant\u2019s hand grabbed my shoulder, pulling me away. In a fit of anger and strength that surprised me, I wrenched away and jumped out of the plane. \n\nThe wind whipping past my face was almost magical, a new sensation after so many months of the same. The ocean below me grew closer and larger, and I realized that suddenly, I didn\u2019t want to die after all. \n\nIt grew larger and larger and larger until it seemed that all I could see was darkness and waves.\n\nI impacted the surface of the water so fast and hard that my entire body jerked around in the seat. I pulled my hand back, sucking at my bruised knuckle. I\u2019d hit it on the seat in front of me.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I whispered. Then shouted. \u201cNO! NO! NO!\u201d\n\nA flight attendant ran down the aisle, kneeling beside me. \u201cAre you OK sir?\u201d\n\nI clenched my hands into fists, almost swinging at her. But then I realized. \n\nShe wasn\u2019t grinning.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t crying. \n\nTo be honest she looked a little scared of me.\n\nI reached my right hand down to my pocket where I could feel my now-unbroken phone. \n\n4:04 AM.\n\n\u201cSir, if you can calm down we\u2019ll be landing in about an hour.\u201d\n\nMy mouth tasted like ash. \u201cThank you,\u201d I managed. \u201cI will.\u201d\n\nI stared unblinking at my phone. It now displayed 4:05 AM.\n\nThen I looked out my window and began to cry at the sight of city lights below me. \n\nWe did land in about an hour. I can\u2019t even begin to explain why or how, but I\u2019m currently sitting in an airport cafe typing this out. I\u2019m free. I\u2019m out.\n\nAnd I\u2019m never going flying again.\n\n---------------------------\n\n---------------------------\n\n\nEDIT: I sure hope the bartender here at the airport just has a naturally wide grin.\n\n---------------------------\n\n---------------------------\n\n\n[Want more?](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WorchesterStreet\/comments\/gbpc8t\/a_huge_storm_swept_through_my_town_a_week_ago_it\/)"},"290":{"title":"When we turn 18, we get the name of our soulmate.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/nmax25\/when_we_turn_18_we_get_the_name_of_our_soulmate\/","flair":"Series","author":"thewackwaffle","selftext":"[Part I](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/nmax25\/when_we_turn_18_we_get_the_name_of_our_soulmate\/) || [Part II](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/nqtu23\/when_we_turn_18_we_get_the_name_of_our_soulmate\/) || [Final](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/nvzhya\/when_we_turn_18_we_get_the_name_of_our_soulmate\/)\n\nI was young when I realized that the place I lived was special.\n\nI didn\u2019t realize it at first, since I had lived there my whole life. I thought it was normal for a city to not allow pets. I grew up never hearing the sounds of barking dogs, or hissing cats. No one that lived inside the city border was allowed to have them.\n\nI thought it was normal for cities to have mandatory blood testing every week, with no explanation or seemingly any reason.\n\nI thought it was normal for cities to not have any jails.\n\nI thought it was normal for cities to give their citizens soulmates.\n\nI never really understood how it worked. All that we were told was that there were the Matchmakers, who were responsible for making the matches, and sending out the tiny slips of paper that determined each citizen\u2019s love life, and future. No one ever saw the Matchmakers. No one knew how they were recruited, no one knew how they worked. All anyone knew was that it worked.\n\nWhere I lived, there has never been a filing for divorce. The Matchmakers are never wrong.\n\nEach citizen received their paper on their 18th birthday. Inside the piece of paper, there was nothing except a name. The name of your supposed soulmate. There was no telling how you would come across this person, no when or how. All anyone knew was that it would eventually happen. We were allowed to tell other people, allowed to ask around, try and seek out people that had the same name as the one on the paper, but it didn\u2019t matter. It couldn\u2019t be forced.\n\nOf course, literal eternal love and happiness does not come without rules. Every citizen had to follow the Rules. They weren\u2019t too strange, and seemed like a small price to pay for what you were getting in return. Most of the rules were simple. To name a few, there was no going outside, under any circumstances, after 2am. No pets, blood tests, etc. There were also rules that we weren\u2019t allowed to know until we were older.\n\nWe got the new rules on our 18th birthday, the same day we got our Matchmaker paper. We called them Slips.\n\nAs I got older, I realized that our city was special, and that other cities didn\u2019t have what we had, but I didn't care. Life was good, life seemed simple. Our city was like a little paradise. It was happy. It was without issue.\n\n||\n\nIt was the night before my 18th birthday, and I couldn\u2019t sleep. This was to be expected, since knowing that the next morning, you would know the name of your literal *soulmate* was enough to keep anyone up late.\n\nUsually, I wouldn\u2019t have believed in such things like soulmates, especially as I got older, but it was hard to argue with evidence. My parents had gotten married in their late 20s, and have stayed happily married ever since, both of their names matching what was on their Slips. My older sister Katlin got her Slip last year, and though she\u2019s been through her fair share of failed relationships, she\u2019s currently in a happy one with some guy named Roger. I don\u2019t think I need to tell you the name that was on her Slip.\n\nI wished Katlin still lived with us. We used to share a room, but ever since she moved out, it feels empty with just me in it. By some miracle, I eventually fell asleep, my brain finally exhausted after hours of wondering what tomorrow was going to bring.\n\nI woke up the next morning, my arm groping for my alarm to turn it off, just like any other day. It wasn\u2019t until I sleepily sat up that I realised that today wasn\u2019t like any other day.\n\nI swung my legs out of bed, my heart pounding in my chest as I tried to compose myself. I wanted to pull on a shirt and shorts as fast as possible, rush to the kitchen to get the envelope I knew would be addressed to me, but I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t want to be one of those people who\u2019s entire lives suddenly revolved around trying to find their soulmate. I needed to be calm.\n\nTaking a few even breaths, I slowly put on a shirt and some basketball shorts, before opening my door. Chatter, and the smell of waffles hit my senses instantly as I stepped out of my room. Turning the corner, I stopped, grinning.\n\n\u201cKatlin!\u201d I said, unable to contain my excitement at seeing her. Reaching her in a few short steps, I wrapped my arms around her in a hug, to which she enthusiastically returned. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I said, pulling myself away to look at her.\n\n\u201cAw, you seriously thought I would miss your birthday? Get real.\u201d She said, matching my grin as she looked at me. \u201c*Damn* you got tall.\u201d She said, looking at me. \u201cHe got it from his old man.\u201d My dad chimed in, and Katlin rolled her eyes. Besides my height, I got a lot from my dad. I got his warm brown eyes, and I got his wavy, dirty blonde hair that I had always kept medium-length. I looked so much like my dad that my mom always chimed in saying how I got her nose and smile.\n\n\u201cHappy birthday hon.\u201d My mom said from the counter, giving me a soft smile. \u201cThese are almost done, and we\u2019ll go out for your birthday dinner later tonight.\u201d She said, gesturing at the waffles, and I smiled. \u201cBirthday waffles for the birthday boy.\u201d My dad chimed in, putting an arm around my mom, and the simple movement made me remember something I forgot in the midst of the excitement. \u201cIs it- is it here?\u201d I asked them, trying to keep my voice even.\n\nMy sister nodded, understanding what I was talking about. \u201cOn the front table.\u201d My legs felt like rubber as I walked the few steps into the hallway, instantly seeing the stark white envelope on the table. I picked it up.\n\n*| Deliver to: Theodore Shillings |*\n\nI walked back to the kitchen, all eyes on me as I turned the envelope over, trying to act calm, act normal.\n\nI opened the envelope, pulling out two pieces of paper. One of them, I knew would be the new rules. The other one, was my Slip. I looked at the bigger paper first.\n\n*To people(s) registered as 18 years as older, the following rules will come into effect.*\n\n1. *Under no circumstances is anyone 18 years or older permitted in city waters. This includes all local rivers within city limits.*\n2. *Under no circumstances will anyone 18 years or older be allowed to watch the television on the 14th of every month.*\n3. *Under no circumstances is anyone 18 years or older permitted to use faucets after 12am. This includes sinks, bathtubs, and showers.*\n4. *Under no circumstances is anyone 18 years or older permitted to use any kind of elevator after 9pm.*\n5. *Under no circumstances is anyone 18 years or older permitted to share their rules with people(s) under the age of 18.*\n\nAnd that was it. I honestly expected more, but was relieved there wasn\u2019t too many that I would have to memorize. They were weird, sure, but nothing that I wouldn\u2019t be able to do. After re- reading the new Rules, I put the paper down, heart hammering as I took my slip. Wanting to get it over with, I opened it, to which a single name was printed.\n\n*Avery*\n\nI read, and re-read the name several times. Avery. Avery. *Avery.*\n\nI racked my brain for people I knew named Avery. There was a girl in my history class, and maybe one who I had pre calc with a few years ago? Before I could wonder further, Katlin\u2019s voice cut me off. \u201cWhat\u2019s the name?\u201d She said, to which I handed it to her. It passed from her, to my mother, then my father. \u201cAvery. Nice name.\u201d My dad said, handing my Slip back to me. Chatter resumed between my parents and Katlin, while my mind was whirring.\n\nSome things made more sense now, like why I never saw adults kayaking in the river like I saw them do in other cities. I had told myself for a long time that once I got my Slip, that I wouldn\u2019t focus too much on it, but my mind kept coming back to the name that was burned into my mind. *Avery*.\n\nI still had to go to school, and got ready while Katlin went out to reconnect with some high school friends. I ignored my texts asking what the name on my Slip was, preferring to have that conversation in person.\n\nMy friends were waiting for me at the bus stop eagerly. There was Jennifer, who was usually pretty quiet, and who I\u2019d known since preschool. There was Joseph, who was a bit of a daredevil and a jock who I\u2019d met during my freshman year. Lastly, there was Charles and Sophia, twins who were never separated, and who I\u2019d bonded with sophomore year over our love for horror movies. Looking at us as a group looked weird, but we worked, and had fun with each other.\n\nI was bombarded with the same question as I got close to them.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s name did you get?\u201d\n\n\u201cAvery.\u201d I said, the first time I had actually said the name. It sounded nice, coming out of my mouth, It sounded right. My friends nodded, followed by a moment of silence that meant that they were all trying to think of Avery\u2019s that we knew.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there a chick in your history class named Avery?\u201d Joseph offered, and I nodded. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m trying not to think about it too much, I don\u2019t wanna become one of those people who become obsessed with it.\u201d I said, although the name was really all I could think about.\n\nMy friends dropped it after that, all except Joseph. He would chime in every few minutes, rattling off girls that he knew, all with the name Avery. He was still talking about it as the bus came, and as we walked up to the school. He really didn\u2019t have an \u201coff\u201d button, which meant that I was left to try and tune him out, nodding my head in agreement every few minutes.\n\nAs the school day went on, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if each Avery I came across was my soulmate. Somehow though, none of the girls I came across felt right.\n\nEverything else aside, the school day went pretty smoothly. People wished me happy birthday in the halls, occasionally asking who I got on my Slip.\n\nAfter school, I still had time before I had to head home and start working on homework, so as usual, I met outside the school with my friends. The day had gotten progressively hotter as it went on, and by the time school was let out, it had reached the point of uncomfort. Most of my friends were already waiting for me, and as I got closer they were already in conversation.\n\n\u201c-balls hot man, we should go claim a spot by the river before it gets too crowded.\u201d Joseph was saying, to which my other friends nodded in agreement. The river he was referring to was the biggest in the city, almost cutting it in half. It was a popular hangout spot, and my friends and I had been going there for ages. But now,  my throat felt tight. None of my friends had turned 18 yet, since I had an extra year of preschool when I was a kid. They didn\u2019t know the new rules.\n\nOne of the rules said I wasn\u2019t allowed to tell them. Did that mean I also couldn\u2019t hint at it?\n\n\u201cEr, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m feeling the river today.\u201d I said, trying to sound as nonchalant as possible.\n\n\u201cAre you crazy? It\u2019s like, 90 degrees out here.\u201d Jennifer said, raising her eyebrows. Not wanting to act suspicious, I decided that I would go, but I wouldn't go in. Under any circumstances.\n\n\u201cAlright let\u2019s go, but I can\u2019t stay long, I have my birthday dinner with Katlin and my parents.\u201d I said, to which Joseph pumped his fist.\n\nRelieved that none of them seemed to suspect anything, we set off towards the river.\n\nThere were a couple other families there, with kids playing in the shallow water and the parents sitting safely on the edge.\n\nI took a few, even breaths to remind myself that I was fine, and that I would stay on the shore. Jennifer and Joseph were the first to the river, instantly pulling up their jeans and taking off their socks and shoes as they dipped them into the river, sighing with the relief that the cool water provided from the hot weather.\n\nI desperately wanted to be there with them, swimming in the river and enjoying the nice weather, but the rules were very clear. I sighed, sitting down a few feet away from the water, my legs out in front of me, watching as my friends splashed each other with the water. I just had to hold out until they had their birthdays, and then I wouldn\u2019t have to make excuses. I could handle a few more months. \u201cOi! Come on birthday boy, get in the water!\u201d Charles yelled, splashing water in my direction as he was ankle deep in it, a few feet away from where it dropped off into deeper waters. I smiled, shaking my head as I adjusted my legs to make myself more comfortable. \u201cNah, I\u2019ll be the one to drive you guys to the hospital when you get hypothermia.\u201d I yelled back, to which I could see his eyes roll from here.\n\n\u201cAw, we can\u2019t have that!\u201d Joseph called, wading back to where I was. \u201cI command the birthday boy to get hypothermia with the rest of us!\u201d Joseph said, smirking as he approached me. I felt a trickle of unease as he approached me. I stood up to move away, but just then he swooped down and picked me up over his shoulder. Joseph played for the football team, and I always admired his strength, but this was the first time I was afraid of it. \u201cJoseph, stop! Put me down!\u201d I yelled, panic rising in my voice, struggling to escape his arms as he was carrying me to the water.\n\nMy heart pounded wildly in my chest, as a rising fear crept up my throat. He outmatched me in size and strength, and my struggles were fruitless. \u201cI\u2019m serious Joseph, put me the fuck down!\u201d I yelled, to which he gave a little laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re always so serious Theo, loosen up! Live a little!\u201d He replied, and I could see he was in the water now, wading further in. I looked at my friends, wide eyed, but they were giggling like it was a joke.\n\nThey had no idea.\n\nAs he got closer to the drop off, I struggled harder, hitting him on the shoulders. I wasn't weak by any standards, but Joseph was built like an ox, almost all muscle. Fear closed my throat so tightly, I couldn't breathe. \u201c Come on, everyone in the water!\" He said, motioning with his head to my friends, who obliged, standing on the edge of the drop. \"Alright on three, we\u2019ll all jump in together.\u201d He put his hands on my waist, and I knew what was coming. \u201cOne\u2026. two\u2026..\u201d He started, rocking back and forth. \u201cJoseph, stop! STOP!\u201d I yelled, punching him harder, but it didn\u2019t make any difference.\n\n\u201cThree!\u201d\n\nI heard the splashes of my friends jumping in, just as I was launched a few feet into the air.\n\nI didn't know what to expect.\n\nI shut my eyes tightly as images rapidly flashed through my mind. I saw myself at my ninth birthday party, saw myself applauding at Kaitlin's graduation. Rapid images throughout my life flashed before me.\n\nWas my life flashing before my eyes?\n\nIt felt like an eternity before I hit the water.\n\nNothing could have prepared me for what happened next.\n\nI hit the water hard, the cold water stinging every part of my body. The wind knocked out of me, but since nothing else happened immediately, I thought, fleetingly, that I was fine.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nIt felt like a giant vacuum was at the bottom of the river, sucking me towards it. I thrashed in the water, desperately trying anything to prevent myself from getting sucked deeper. I had been swimming in the deep part of the river before, and one summer my friends and I actually measured how deep it was, and I knew well enough that I was being pulled far beyond that. I was running out of air, and my panicked state wasn't helping the situation.\n\nWhatever was down there started to pull me faster, as if whatever it was could sense my desperation. My chest felt tight, as I could no longer hold my breath. My body started to go limp when suddenly- I was falling.\n\nI was no longer in water, and I took a gasp of breath, sputtering out the water that had managed to get in my mouth from my surprise. I was so relieved to be breathing again, that it took me a minute to realize I was falling rapidly through the air. Darkness surrounded me, and through my confused, dazed state I couldn't make out what was around me. A few seconds later, for the second time during the day, my body hit water again, hard.\n\nOnce again, I had the wind knocked out of me, and I could feel myself sinking. I couldn't move, I couldn't breathe.\n\nI didn't have the energy to panic. My eyes closed. I didn't know what I was supposed to think about. I didn't want my last thoughts before death to be wasted.\n\nIt was during these last thoughts that suddenly, something pulled me away from them.\n\nLiterally.\n\nI could feel something grabbing the back of my shirt, pulling me upwards, towards the surface. Confusion swept me as a moment later, I felt myself being heaved out of the water, and being roughly set down, on something hard, something solid. I gasped, coughing and sputtering as water dripped off of me.\n\nI shakily pushed myself onto my hands and knees, trying to get my breathing under control, my thoughts moving at the speed of light. I felt oddly light-headed, my body drained and exhausted. I wanted to look around for my savior, but I couldn't. My vision had started to go black, as my exhausted body finally collapsed.\n\n||\n\nSomeone was shaking me awake. My first, fleeting thought that it was my mom, telling me I was going to be late for school. Then I remembered. It was just a dream. I told myself. Just a dream. You'll open your eyes and mom is going to wish you a happy birthday, tell you you're going to be late for school-\n\nSomeone shook me harder. I opened my eyes. It was not my mom.\n\nIt was a boy, who looked around my age with dark, messy hair and who was looking at me with two dark blue concerned eyes, who looked relieved as I opened my eyes. \"Good. You're awake. Come on, we need to move.\" He said quickly, looking behind him. Confusion clouded my mind. \"Who- who are you? And where am I?\" I said, trying to keep the fear out of my voice. The boy looked back at me. \"My name is Avery. I can explain everything later, but we really have to go.\"\n\nMy breath caught in my throat. Avery. Avery. Avery.\n\nOh, shit."},"291":{"title":"The terrifying note addressed to my six-year-old son","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/63m9pe\/the_terrifying_note_addressed_to_my_sixyearold_son\/","flair":"Series","author":"Creeping_dread","selftext":"My wife and I are beside ourselves right now. This is the type of thing you see in the movies, but now it\u2019s happening to us.\n\nYesterday evening, a little after six, my wife and I were in the kitchen cooking dinner when my six-year-old (almost 7) son Kyle walked in from the back patio. He was holding a folded piece of paper in his hand and had a strange look on his face. My son is constantly drawing (and loves to read and write) so this usually wouldn\u2019t have stood out to me at all, but he\u2019d just come in from hitting the baseball off the tee and really had no reason to be holding a piece of paper. \n\nMy son is the type of kid who wears his emotions on his sleeve. When I asked to see the piece of paper, I could tell he didn\u2019t really want to give it to me because he flashed his typical *I\u2019m gonna be in trouble if I do* face. I insisted, and he finally handed it over. Here\u2019s what it said:\n\n>Dear Kyle,\n\n>I know this note may sound scary,\n\n>(your daddy will think it is),\n\n>but grownups don\u2019t know \n\n>how friendships can grow\n\n>when kids are just left to be kids.\n\n>And what a kid you\u2019ve become, Kyle!\n\n>You\u2019re growing as fast as a weed.\n\n>Last night off the tee\n\n>you stroked it for three\n\n>and your team took a two-run lead!\n\n>Yes, I\u2019ve been watching (a while now, its true).\n\n>I think we would make perfect friends.\n\n>You\u2019re a kid through and through,\n\n>And I am one too,\n\n>even if just for pretends.\n\n>The problem, I fear, is your parents.\n\n>(I doubt they would let us hang out).\n\n>One is just rude,\n\n>the other a prude,\n\n>church-going, pure, holy, devout.\n\n>I\u2019ve got an idea\n\n>(can you tell my hand\u2019s shaking?)\n\n>for me and you getting together!\n\n>Tomorrow at three,\n\n>you can come and see me\n\n>at the address attached to this letter.\n\n>But please (pretty please!)\n\n>don\u2019t tell your dad!\n\n>Your mom and he won\u2019t understand.\n\n>Just come by yourself,\n\n>I\u2019ll be dressed as an elf!\n\n>And we can even hold hands!\n\n>Would you like that?\n\n>(You will! You really will Kyle!)\n\n>We will have (my oh my) so much fun!\n\n>So I\u2019ll see you at three,\n\n>by the sycamore tree,\n\n>where our two kindred souls become one!\n\nThere was an address scribbled at the bottom of the page.\n\n>3 Orange Circle.\n\nI knew immediately it wasn\u2019t a prank. \n\nCarrie, my wife, is the youth group leader at our church. And Kyle did just have a tee ball game last night. Orange Circle is only one street over from our street, and I'm pretty sure lot 3 is the corner lot on the culdesac, which has an empty house with a large sycamore tree in the backyard. \n\nWas this sicko really watching Kyle\u2019s game? What would have happened I hadn\u2019t seen him with the letter?\n\nI shouted for my wife to come read it. When she did, she flipped out, and ran for the phone to call the police. \n\nI flipped the note over, and on the back was some more text. I couldn\u2019t read it at first, but quickly realized it was written backwards, I\u2019m guessing so Kyle couldn\u2019t have read it. To read it, I had to hold it up in front of a mirror:\n\n>And now (just in case)\n\n>if your Dad\u2019s reading this,\n\n>it\u2019s time to tell him a story.\n\n>If your mom flaps her hole\n\n>Or your dad tells a soul,\n\n>I\u2019m afraid things might get rather gory. \n\n>On the 10th of July, \n\n>1995,\n\n>A woman named Susie went missing,\n\n>Susie, you see,\n\n>(unlike you and me)\n\n>wasn\u2019t careful about who she\u2019d been kissing.\n\n>I kept her a while (but old things get so boring!)\n\n>and in time I had gotten my fill.\n\n>I threw her away\n\n>and to my great dismay\n\n>the hunger I felt plagued me still.\n\n>I tried to bury it deep down inside\n\n>(where nothing down there can escape).\n\n>But lately it seems\n\n>I see Kyle in my dreams\n\n>And that hunger can no longer hide.\n\n>Now that you know what I\u2019m capable of\n\n>(more than both of you can comprehend),\n\n> if one word is spoken,\n\n>then children get broken,\n\n>and Susie will have a new friend.\n\nThe police arrived in a half hour and we showed them the note. They told us to stay inside and lock the doors for the remainder of the night. The man had obviously been in our (fenced-in) back yard, which made me sick to my stomach and had me cursing myself for not installing the security camera I\u2019d gotten for Christmas. \n\nNothing happened last night, thank God.\n\nThis morning, I got a call from the detective assigned to our case. He\u2019d reviewed the list of missing persons cases from 1995 and something had turned up. \n\nSuzanne Kerrington went missing July 10th, 1995, just as the note said. The last person to see her alive was a friend who saw her at the 24-hour gym they attended together. Susie had said she\u2019d met someone new and wanted to get a quick workout in before getting ready for their second date. Susie was never seen again and the man was never identified. \n\nAnd, maybe the worst part, was Suzanne's address. \n\n3 Orange Circle. \n\nI'm supposed to meet with the detective later this evening. \n\nWhat should we do?\n\nUPDATE: The detective just called back. They're sending an unmarked patrol car with two plainclothes officers to 3 Orange Circle at 3 p.m. today. Kyle's teachers have been notified and he's safe at school and won't be going to recess today. I'll update tomorrow with any news.\n\n[Update 1](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/63uu1m\/the_terrifying_note_addressed_to_my_sixyearold\/)\n\n***\n\n[Download the FREE audiobook!](https:\/\/gumroad.com\/l\/RRPSp)\n"},"292":{"title":"Under The Back Porch","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/8zb8k9\/under_the_back_porch\/","flair":null,"author":"theoddcatlady","selftext":"As a kid I lived with neglectful parents at best. At worst dad would turn his screams and fists on me but I learned quickly how to dodge the worst of it. Mom wasn\u2019t much help, she\u2019d just smoke in the kitchen and bitch at him for staying out so late.\n\nAt the time we lived basically in the middle of nowhere, our nearest neighbors were a long walk away for a six year old and we had trees between us. No one to run to for help. But I was pretty small for a kid my age. I learned I could fit pretty much anywhere. The closet. Dryer. I think even once I tucked myself under my futon in such a way I could still get some air but no one could see me.\n\nI was a master at hiding. But it wasn\u2019t for a good reason.\n\nOne night though, one night I chose to do something different.\n\nI could hear it in dad\u2019s yells, he was pissed and was about to get violent. Mom wasn\u2019t helping either, just piling fuel onto an inferno of a flame. So I knew I had to find a good hiding spot. I\u2019d gotten the idea a few days before, when I realized the lattice covering the bottom half of the back porch had a hole in it. Not big enough to fit a full grown man, most likely, but it could fit a skinny six year old no problem.\n\nSo wrapping myself up in my blanket and grabbing my hippo stuffie, I snuck out my window and ran into the backyard. In the middle of autumn. When it was forty degrees out and the temperature was steadily dropping.\n\nI crawled under the porch, scraping my elbows and getting splinters in my palms but I fit inside. It was actually quite spacious compared to most my hiding spots, I couldn\u2019t sit up all the way but I had plenty of room to spread out my limbs.\n\nOf course I was also getting covered in dirt. It\u2019d rained a few days ago so the mud was still a little wet. I wrapped myself in my blankie the best I could and settled in for the night.\n\nBut soon, even with my blankie and my hippo, my teeth were chattering so hard I could barely breathe. I didn\u2019t want to go back inside though, knowing if my dad caught me I\u2019d be in for the whipping of my life. So I had to tough it out.\n\n\u201cHoney, are you cold?\u201d\n\nThat voice was not the voice of my mother, scratchy from all the smoking and screeching she did. It was sweet, like honey. I turned over to see the dim outline of a woman, lying on her stomach next to me. She had a pretty butterfly necklace and was just as dirty as I was.\n\nI nodded, not wondering how she\u2019d been down there without me noticing.\n\nThe woman belly crawled forward and wrapped her arms around me and suddenly I became warm. Like I was sitting next to a campfire. I snuggled into her arms, not minding the mud, after all we were both dirty.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten so big,\u201d the woman said, examining my face. \u201cHow old are you now, Alex?\u201d\n\n\u201cSix.\u201d How did I know this woman again? I didn\u2019t think I did.\n\n\u201cSix!\u201d The woman gasped. \u201cYou\u2019re all grown up then. I\u2019m so happy.\u201d She sighed pleasantly and stroked my hair. I\u2019d never felt so cozy in my life.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I asked.\n\nShe smiled, I could hear it in her voice. \u201cI\u2019m Lily. What\u2019s your favorite thing to do?\u201d\n\nI had to think for a second. \u201cI like board games. And coloring.\u201d\n\nLily chuckled. \u201cJust like me then. Could never get enough of Scrabble. But I guess you\u2019re still too young to play that, huh?\u201d\n\nI nodded. \u201cLotsa words. I wanna play it though. I like the tiles. Would you play with me?\u201d\n\nI heard Lily sharply inhale. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t think I can. Your daddy put me under here, and I can\u2019t leave\u2026 but\u2026\u201d She thought for a second. \u201cAlex, could you do me a favor?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course!\u201d This lady was oh so nice. Why wouldn\u2019t I do her a favor?\n\n\u201cWhen you wake up in the morning, go to the police station. Ask for an officer by the name of Lowell Joyce. Tell him where to find Lily, okay? Under your back porch. He\u2019ll come and he\u2019ll get me, okay? And\u2026 and then maybe we can play Scrabble.\u201d\n\nYippee! I was too excited about the possibility of playing Scrabble to notice how Lily\u2019s voice caught at the end. I nodded vigorously. \u201cI\u2019ll do it! We can be on the same team, right?\u201d\n\nLily softly laughed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you understand the rules. Goodnight, Alex.\u201d\n\nWhen I woke up the next morning, I heard Lily\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cGo now. Your dad\u2019s gone to work. I\u2019ll tell you how to get to the station.\u201d\n\nRubbing my eyes, I crawled out from under the porch and went into the house to grab my shoes and a coat. I shivered in the frosty cold. But I thought Lily was right behind me.\n\nAfter my shoes and coat were on I started walking. It was long enough to get to the neighbor\u2019s house. I really can\u2019t remember how long it took to get to the police station, although I have no idea why no one pulled over to see what the hell a six year old in dirty pajamas was doing walking alongside the road. Lily kept guiding me onward.\n\n\u201cWait. Okay, cross the street now.\u201d\n\n\u201cTurn right here.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep going! You\u2019ve almost made it!\u201d\n\nI nearly collapsed with exhaustion by the time I walked into the station. The guys out front chatting and having a good time didn\u2019t see me until I almost made it to the front desk.\n\n\u201cWhoa! Kid! You okay?\u201d One of the officers knelt down to my level, eyes wide.\n\nI nodded. \u201cI\u2019m okay. Can I speak to Lowell Joyce?\u201d I asked.\n\nOne of the other officers picked me up. \u201cSure kid, sure, let\u2019s just get you someplace warm, holy shit your lips are blue\u2026\u201d\n\nI remembered quietly scolding the man about watching his language. \u2018Shit\u2019 was a bad word.\n\nI was given some warm cocoa and wrapped up in a blanket by the time an old man with a graying mustache sat by me.\n\n\u201cHey kid. I\u2019m Sheriff Joyce. What\u2019s your name?\u201d He asked.\n\n\u201cAlex.\u201d I set down my cup and looked him straight in the eye. \u201cI was told to tell you that Lily is under the back porch.  You need to go let her out so we can play Scrabble.\u201d\n\nI had never seen a grown man turn pale before.\n\nLots of things blurred together at this point. I remember being taken back to my house and there were a lot of police cars and people around. The back porch was surrounded by yellow tape, and someone was taking a black bag away while my dad was in handcuffs.\n\nAfter that, I lived with my grandparents. Sheriff Joyce and his wife.\n\nI tried to ask about what happened and who was Lily but I always got shut down. I was too young to know.\n\nBut life got better. A lot better.\n\nGrandpa was the best man I could\u2019ve hoped for in my life. We went out on weekends to the movies where he let me have the giant soda even though I\u2019d have to pee in the middle of the movie. When I asked if I could drink when I was thirteen he let me try a beer. I spat it out and didn\u2019t touch it again. He never judged me for my love of art, letting me paint my own bedroom multiple times over the years. I felt safe around him. He never laid a hand on me. My grandmother was amazing too, over the week she\u2019d homeschool me along with teaching me things that you wouldn\u2019t learn in a school, such as how to respect others but not take their crap. And cooking. Lots of cooking. I could make my own birthday cake by the time I was twelve. But I usually just made them for my friends. I got a lot of those, after I was free from my dad.\n\nWhen I turned sixteen, Grandpa took me back to my dad\u2019s house.\n\nThe whole thing had been bulldozed over. But I could still see the yellow tape wound around a few trees, faded and torn.\n\nWe sat together on the back of his truck. He opened a beer and drank half of it before setting it down and grabbing me an orange soda.\n\nAfter I\u2019d drank it he told me.\n\n\u201cLily was your mother.\u201d\n\nGood thing he didn\u2019t tell me as I was swallowing, I likely would\u2019ve had it coming out of my nose. \u201cMy mom?\u201d I questioned, confused.\n\n\u201cYour actual mom. The woman who lived with your dad was not your mother.\u201d My granddad grabbed another beer. \u201cLily was my daughter. I loved her so much\u2026 but when you were around six months old, she vanished.\u201d\n\nMy stomach dropped. \u201cMy dad just imprisoned her under the porch?\u201d I asked, starting to feel sick.\n\nGrandpa took a deep breath before setting his unopened beer down. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026. something I\u2019ve never been able to understand. Lily told you to find me? And that she loved Scrabble?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. She kept me warm that night. I probably would\u2019ve frozen to death if she hadn\u2019t been there.\u201d I was a stupid kid, even I knew that.\n\nGrandpa went dead quiet before he opened that beer and slammed the whole thing. \u201c\u2026 Alex, Lily had been dead the whole time she was gone. When we dug her up she was bones. Experts confirmed it, and your dad confessed to what happened. They\u2019d gotten into a fight and he threw her down the stairs. She\u2026 broke her neck.\u201d He clenched his fists. \u201cI knew he had something to do with her disappearance, but I never had proof until you walk into my station, covered in dirt and telling me she was under the porch.\u201d\n\nI was floored. I couldn\u2019t breathe. All I could do was shake my head.\n\n\u201cBut- I saw her! She was alive! She had this butterfly necklace\u2026\u201d I trailed off when Grandpa pulled an evidence baggie from his pocket.\n\nThere was that butterfly necklace all right. Rusty, and parts of the paint had chipped off, but I remembered it as clearly as I remembered Lily\u2019s voice.\n\nGrandpa took a shaky breath as he pressed the bag into my hands. \u201c\u2026 Lily loved you so much. \u2018ts why she stuck around that bastard. You were her whole world. She was constantly taking pictures and sendin\u2019 them to us in the mail. Sometimes a mother\u2019s love can accomplish things that no human can do.\u201d\n\nMy eyes overflowed with tears as I clutched the necklace to my chest. Choking on sobs, I leaned against Grandpa. He held me tight and I swear I felt a few of his tears land on the top of my head.\n\nAnd for just a brief moment, I swear I felt that warm love I felt that night under the porch."},"293":{"title":"Every night, my girlfriend wakes me up to tell the exact same joke.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/vrdoja\/every_night_my_girlfriend_wakes_me_up_to_tell_the\/","flair":null,"author":"Point_Of_No_Return-","selftext":"Before i start, i feel like i should let something very clear: I absolutely love Ellen. We've been living together for about three years now, but have known each other our whole lives. In fact, we were childhood friends - and i know this may sound like a fairy tale to some people, but it truly felt like we were always destined to be together. Even after graduation, when we started dating other people, it only felt truly right when we were with each other. So i don't know what took me so long to ask her out, but i'm really glad i did.\n\nWe have the same taste in music, movies, and even food. We laugh at the same dumb jokes, and know exactly how to comfort each other in times of need. She's the kindest, most gentle and loving girl i ever met. We even been talking about our plans for marriage, and how we would like to have kids of our own. That's why it hurts so much how it all went terribly wrong, in just four nights.\n\nI would also like to preface that Ellen doesn't have much of a family other than me, and some very distant aunts that she never met and doesn't even know their names. I was born in a big family, with four siblings and plenty of cousins that were always visiting, and even helping out when we got in trouble. Ellen has none of that. She doesn't have any siblings, and her father was an alcoholic, abusive freak that died when she was young. Her mother was a very kind and inspiring person, that took care of the family by herself for many years. And almost a second mother to myself. So when she passed away last year, it hurt us both for a long time.\n\nBut Ellen stayed strong. She's not the type to let her feelings easily surface, so you gotta be a lot more perceptive to get what she truly feels. I used to proud myself in being capable of that. I felt like i knew her better than i knew myself. That's why this is all so strange, and frankly, terrifying.\n\nWe were sleeping in bed, and i was dreaming. I don't really remember what it was about, but for some reason i'm sure of it. Until i heard her voice, very close to my ear:\n\n*''Knock, knock. Knock, knock.''*\n\nShe was caressing my hair, gently, while sitting in bed and looking below at me.\n\nI slowly opened my eyes, groggy from sleep.\n\n''Hey... what is it, baby?''\n\nShe kept looking at me, fixated. And repeated:\n\n*''Knock, knock. Knock, knock.''*\n\nI glanced at the digital clock, on top of the dresser. *3:27 AM.* I had work in only a few hours.\n\n''What is it, Ellen?''\n\nShe paused. - ''Please answer the joke, dear. *Knock, knock. Knock, knock.''*\n\n''Fine.'' - I accepted, mostly because i was expecting some kind of surprise. Ellen wasn't the type to do what she was doing for no reason. - ''Who's there?''\n\nHer smile opened up, and she answered: ''*Not me. So don't answer the door.''*\n\nI kept looking at her, dumbfounded. What was that supposed to mean?\n\n''Is that it? Is that the joke?''\n\n''Yes'' - She said, laying in the couch and covering herself with a blanket. - ''Thank you for answering.''\n\n''Weirdo.'' - I answered, closing my eyes and going back to sleep.\n\nNext morning, things went as usual. I only remembered the strange conversation while i was alone in the bathroom, brushing my teeth, and wasn't even sure if it had truly happened or if it was just a weird dream. So we had our breakfast together, and she was acting normal, reading something aloud from a fashion magazine. Frankly, i wasn't paying much attention. So i took the opportunity to ask about last night.\n\nInitially, she didn't seem to know what i was talking about. Then her eyes fixated on me and the same smile from last night crossed her face, briefly. And i knew it wasn't just a dream. She told me it wasn't anything of importance, and stopped paying attention when i asked more inquisitively. And even though i shouldn't, i gave up. I had work and other matters to attend to, and just brushed off the weird event thinking it wouldn't happen again.\n\nBut the following night, i woke up to her voice.\n\n*''Knock, knock.'' -* A pause. - ''*Knock.''*\n\n''What is it now?'' - I said. - ''Ellen, what are you doing?''\n\n*''Knock, knock. Knock.'' -* She repeated.\n\nThis time, she wasn't even touching me. Just sitting in bed, looking at me with that same smile. But her eyes semeed larger, and she blinked in longer intervals. I looked at the clock. Once again, *3:27 AM.*\n\n''Ellen, c'mon. What is it? I got work in a few hours, can't have the luxury of waking up in the middle of the night to answer Knock Knock jokes.''\n\n''*Knock, Knock. Knock.''*\n\n''This is getting creepy, you know? I'm not sure if this is some gag you've been doing, but i don't like it.''\n\n''Answer it. *Knock, Knock. Knock.''*\n\nI sighed, but also let a small laugh escape. It was creepy, of course, but she was also my Ellen. So it didn't bother me as much as it should.\n\n''Fine. Who the fuck is there?'' - I answered in a playful tone.\n\n''*Not me. So don't answer the door.''*\n\nFor some reason, i felt a chill down in my spine. It was the same answer as before, and i still didn't get what it meant. But the way she said it, with a strange, monotone voice, contrasted well with her smile and the fact that i had no idea of what she meant by that.\n\n''What does that mean?'' - I asked. - ''I really don't get it.''\n\nShe just smiled, and went back to sleep. I felt a throb in my heart, but did the same.\n\nNext day, we talked again about what was happening. She was very evasive with my questions, and i barely got her to say anything. It was almost as if she couldn't talk about it, which was very strange, considering we talk about pretty much everything. I told her i needed to be well rested for work, something she should understand well, and wasn't liking her little gag every night. She just nodded. And i decided to not press further, as i didn't want to hurt her feelings and had work to attend to.\n\nWhen i got back home, we had dinner, watched a movie and went to bed.\n\n*''Knock, Knock''*\n\nI opened my eyes faster this time around. In fact, i barely got any sleep - i just knew she would do it again and kept thinking about it the whole time. Glanced at the clock: *3:27 AM.*\n\n*''Knock, Knock''*\n\nI thought about ignoring her. Just pretending i was asleep and she wouldn't wake me up. So i closed my eyes slowly, hoping that she hadn't seen me opening them in the first place, and stayed quiet.\n\n*''Knock, Knock''*\n\nShe continued. She didn't stop. I regulated my breathing, but she kept going.\n\n*''Knock, Knock''*\n\n''I'm not answering your fucking joke, Ellen. Stop it.''\n\n*''Knock, Knock''*\n\nI ignored but she kept going. She had never been this insistent with anything before. I tried to ignore it, but it was getting on my nerves, and frankly, i felt scared. Why was Ellen doing this? Why every night, at the same exact time down to the minute? Why wouldn't she let me sleep until i answered her?\n\n*''Knock, Knock''*\n\nI got up in a sudden movement.\n\n''God dammit, Ellen.'' - I was ready for a discussion, but when i finally glanced at her, it was as if the strength was drained from me.\n\nShe wasn't smiling. She wasn't blinking. Just staring right at me, fixated like an animal. And her mouth was moving, slowly, and she didn't stop. ''*Knock, Knock''.*\n\nI didn't know how to react, or what expression i had when i saw her but my heart skipped a beat. It was terrifying, as if her gaze froze me in place. A thousand-yard stare.\n\n*''Knock, Knock''*\n\n''Who's there?'' - I asked, feeling as if it was the only way out of that nightmare.\n\n*''Not me. So don't answer the door'' -* She said, weakly.\n\nEllen slowly closed her eyes and layed down. I kept staring at her while she fell into what seemed to be a deep sleep.\n\nI got up and and left. I walked downstairs and sat down at the couch in the living room, staring at the night sky outside and absorbing the quiet of the neighborhood. My heart was beating fast and it didn't slow down. I was too scared to sleep in the same room as my girlfriend, all because of a fucking Knock Knock joke. But it was unnatural. I thought about calling someone. I thought about it all being some kind of sleep-related issue, such as some type of sleep-walking. But it didn't make any sense.\n\nI felt so tired. And decided that early in the morning, i would call an old friend who's a psychologist and get the opinion of a professional. Something was wrong with Ellen.\n\nI stayed in the couch as the day rose, and once Ellen woke up, she was acting normal again. Even asked me why i wasn't in bed. I didn't answer. In fact, i didn't speak to her and simply left for work. She seemed very upset, but i wouldn't do anything about it. Once i got to work i called my friend, told him everything that was happening in as much detail as i'm describing now. He didn't seem as worried as i figured, but we agreed in making an appointment for next week. Now i just needed to convince Ellen to come with me.\n\nI received plenty of text messages from her. She seemed very worried, sad and even confused. She apologized a lot, and it broke my heart a little. I felt bad. I shouldn't have, but i answered her, and made her promise it wouldn't happen again. I also told her about the appointment, and she seemed reluctant but agreed to go with me. So we made up.\n\nThis was Ellen, after all. The girl i knew ever since i was six years old. The woman i loved and that had taken care of me for years. And as much as that strange behaviour creeped me out, she wasn't doing anything particularly frightening, or even dangerous. So for a brief while, i convinced myself i should give her another chance.\n\nWhen i returned home from work, we stayed together. She even prepared my favorite meal. Ellen was acting as gentle and caring as i always remembered, and i slept with her in our bedroom, even though i was still a bit reluctant.\n\n*''Knock''*\n\nI couldn't believe it. She promised me she wouldn't.\n\n*''Knock''*\n\nI gazed at the clock. *3:27 AM.* Always.\n\n*''Knock''*\n\nI was laying on my stomach and i couldn't see her face. In fact, i didn't even bother to look at her. I was feeling more sad than scared, at that point. Sad that she had broken her word.\n\n*''Knock''*\n\n''Who's there?'' - I answered, determined to just go back to sleep.\n\n*''Not me. So don't answer the door.''*\n\nI stayed quiet and closed my eyes. I just hoped i would be able to handle it until the appointment next week.\n\nTo my surprise, i was actually able to sleep. Probably because i hadn't been able to rest since last night. The following morning, i went back to not saying anything to Ellen, only very limited responses. I was expecting her to act same as yesterday, trying to apologize, but she didn't. Mostly she didn't say anything, almost as if she had accepted it. She also looked tired, or at least a bit weak.\n\nI went to work, but i couldn't stop thinking about her. Didn't receive any messages either. Once i got back, we had the most silent dinner i ever had in my life. And she barely ate anything.\n\nI decided to let her have the bedroom and sleep on the couch. I wasn't sure if it would stop her, but held on to the hope that she wouldn't go downstairs only to tell me the same Knock Knock joke again. I covered myself with a blanket, shaked off that uneasy feeling and tried to sleep.\n\nI had a deep sleep, without dreams. Felt like i was lost in darkness. Then i heard breathing.\n\nOpened my eyes to see Ellen, standing above me, looking at me with big, fixated eyes and dilated pupils that didn't seem to belong in such a completly neutral expression. Watching me sleep.\n\nI almost screamed in terror. Jumped out of the couch, and her eyes followed me as i stumbled through the dark room, creating distance between us. For a moment i was able to glance at the clock above the table: *3:27 AM.*\n\n''Ellen, what are you doing?!'' - I asked, desperate. But she didn't move.\n\nIn fact, she didn't say anything. Just stared at me, as if i was made of glass and she could see right through me.\n\nThen i heard a knock on the front door.\n\nInstinctively, i looked in that direction. It was followed by another knock. And another. Someone almost pounding at the door.\n\nI glanced back at Ellen, and she was still staring at me. Slowly, i got closer to the door and she didn't move. The pounding continued.\n\n''Who's there?!'' - I screamed.\n\nIt stopped. And then, i heard a voice.\n\n''John? John, can you hear me? Open the door, please! John, please open the door!''\n\nI froze in place. The voice kept calling me. But i couldn't believe it. It was Ellen's voice, coming from the other side of the door. But it couldn't be.\n\n''I beg you, John! Open the door, it's serious! She's not me, i swear! She's not me!''\n\nSlowly i turned my head to look at Ellen, standing in front of the couch. She was looking at me, the same fixated eyes and a terrible, wide grin across her face.\n\nThe pounding continued. ''John, open the door! Please, you have to trust me!''\n\nI stayed still, not knowing what to do. And i don't remember what happened after that.\n\nI just woke up in my bedroom. The digital clock indicates it's *4:21 AM.* Ellen isn't by my side, i'm completly alone. I'm trembling, uncontrollably and i don't know what's going on. I don't remember what happened after i saw her terrible grim. I don't know if i opened the door.\n\nI tried to look for my phone, see if i could call the police, or at least someone that i know. But i left it downstairs. All i have is Ellen's laptop, and it's where i'm writing this right now, to get advice. Because i can't go downstairs. The corridor is dark, very dark, almost as if the shadows were leaning into the room. And i can hear a faint, scratching sound coming from below.\n\nWhat should i do?"},"294":{"title":"I'm a Search and Rescue Officer for the US Forest Service, I have some stories to tell (Part 4!)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3jadum\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/","flair":"Series","author":"searchandrescuewoods","selftext":"Part 1: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3iex1h\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/\n\nPart 2: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3ijnt6\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/\n\nPart 3: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3iocju\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/\n\nHey guys! I'm back from my training op, and I have a lot of really interesting stories to share with you. I've got enough that I'm going to break them up into two parts, this being the first. I'd love to put them all in one entry, but I just haven't had a chance to write them all down yet.\nI didn't have anything too crazy happen while I was out there, but we did have one incident with a rookie that I found relevant. Since I'm sure you guys have been waiting for these, I'll just get right into the stories. I'll assign each batch of stories to the person who told them to me.\n\n**K.D:** \nK. D is a vet who's been an SAR officer for about fifteen years. She specializes in high elevation mountain rescues, and is widely considered one of the best in her field. She was one of the more enthusiastic storytellers, and since we were together a fair amount during exercises, she ended up telling me about four that really stuck with me.\n\n* The first she told me in response to my asking about her most traumatic calls. She shook her head and told me that really bad calls happen more frequently on the mountain, since the potential for nasty accidents is higher. \nAbout five years ago, one of the parks she worked at had a string of disappearances. It was a bad year, she said, one of the worst on record as far as weather went. They were getting about a foot of new snow every couple of days, and there were a few avalanches that killed some climbers. They'd warned people about staying on the mapped areas, but of course there's always those who don't listen.\nIn one particularly nasty case, an entire family got wiped out because the father decided he knew better than the officials, and he took them out into an area that wasn't safe. They were snowshoeing, and as best K.D could figure, they'd walked onto a shelf of snow that looked solid, but actually wasn't. It gave way, and this family went ass over teakettle almost three hundred feet down a slope. They landed on the rocks at the bottom, and the parents died instantly. One of the kids did as well, but the other two survived. One had a broken leg and fractured ribs, the other was almost unharmed save for some bruising and a sprained ankle. The uninjured child left his sibling behind and set out to find help. \nK.D said the kid didn't make it more than half a mile before a storm overtook him. Kid stopped to try and get warm, or maybe just to rest, and ended up freezing to death. They ended up finding the family with the help of some witnesses who saw them heading out into the wilderness, and she was the one to find the kid who'd frozen to death looking for help. She said it had started to snow, just enough to obscure long-distance vision, but not enough to make searching impossible. She saw a figure sitting in the snow up ahead, and she got to it as quickly as possible. She described, in detail, how as she got closer, she realized first that it was a child, second that they were deceased, and third that they had frozen in one of the most pitiful positions she's ever found a corpse in.\nThe kid was sitting upright, with his knees tucked up against his chest. His arms were curled around them, and his head was tucked up in his coat. When she moved the coat to look at his face, she saw that he'd died crying. His face was twisted, and the tears were frozen on his cheeks. She said it was painfully obvious that the kid was terrified when he succumbed to hypothermia, and as a mother, it broke her heart. She told me, repeatedly, that she hopes the father is burning in hell as we speak. \n\n* The other traumatic story she told me that stood out, in my mind, was one that happened when she was a rookie. Her team got a report of an experienced climber who hadn't come home the previous day. His wife was convinced that something bad had happened, because he'd never failed to come home on time. They went out looking for him, and had to climb what sounded like some very technically challenging parts of the mountain. They got to a relatively flat area, and K.D started seeing blood in the snow. She followed the trail, and as she went, she started seeing little bits of tissue. She wasn't sure exactly what body part it had come from, but the farther she followed it, the more there was. She follows this blood-and-tissue trail to a sheltered area under a cliff face, and she finds the climber. She said there was so much blood, more than she'd ever seen before. He was lying face down, one arm stretched in front of him, as if he'd died crawling. She looks closer, and sees that he's been partially disemboweled, which is where the tissue she'd seen had come from. The guy has an ice pick tucked into a hip holster, and it's covered in blood. Of course, they'll never be sure exactly what happened, but she said as best she can figure, this is what went down:\nThe guy had been attempting to climb up to the next area, and had been using his ice ax to ascend. He'd probably hit a loose patch, and had fallen. On the way down, or possibly when he landed, he'd gotten impaled by the ax, and it had disemboweled him. He'd drug himself along, tearing pieces of himself out as he went, and had died under the cliff face. She isn't terribly bothered by gore, but I guess a few of the guys who came to help her remove the body threw up when they turned him over and a good portion of his intestines spilled out.\n\n* I mentioned to her that I was interested in hearing about any experiences she had with people completely disappearing. Her eyes light up, and she leans in close to me. \n'Wanna hear a real doozy?' She asks. \nShe tells me about how, when she first started, there was a case that got a lot of attention in the media. A family had been out berry picking in an area of the forest very close to the entrance of the park. They had two little boys, both under the age of five, and at some point during the day, one of them vanishes. There's an absolutely massive search, and they find absolutely nothing. It's another of those cases where it's like the kid was never there in the first place. The dogs just sit down and don't pick up on anything, no trace of the kid is found. The search goes on for about two months, but is eventually called off.\nFast forward to six months later. The family comes back to place flowers at a memorial that's been set up there for the kid. They bring their other son. While they're placing the flowers, they lose sight of the kid for about three seconds, and in that span of time he vanishes into thin air. Now obviously, the parents are beyond devastated. It's awful enough to lose one child, but to lose two is beyond imagining. The search is huge, one of the largest in state history. There are about three hundred volunteers combing every inch of this park, looking for the kid. But again, there's no trace of him. The search goes on for about a week, with people looking miles from the part of the park he vanished from.\nAnd then, almost two weeks later, a volunteer almost fifteen miles from the designated search area radios in that he's found the kid. They assumed that the kid was dead, but the volunteer says he's not only alive, he's in good shape. K.D and her team go out to recover the kid, and when they get there, she can't believe that this is the kid that's been missing. His clothes are clean, there's no dirt on him anywhere, and he doesn't appear traumatized. The volunteer says he found the kid sitting on a log, playing with a little twig bundle that's bound together with some old rope. K.D asks him where he's been, who he was with for those two weeks, and the kid tells her that he's been with 'the fuzzy man'. Now K.D firmly believes in Bigfoot, so she gets all excited and asks what he means by fuzzy. Was he hairy? But the kid says no, he wasn't hairy. He was a 'fuzzy man', and he describes a man that's blurry, 'like when you close your eyes but not all the way closed.' He says the man came out of the trees and took the kid with him deep into the woods. The kid says he slept in a hollow tree, and the fuzzy man gave him berries to eat. K.D asks if the man was mean, if he scared the kid, and the kid says 'no, he wasn't scary. but i didn't like how he didn't have eyes.'\nK.D says they get the kid back to headquarters, and a cop takes him into town to talk to him more about what happened. She's friends with the cop that talked to him, and she said the kid described being kept in this tree by the fuzzy man, and given berries whenever he was hungry. He was allowed to wander around a very specific clearing, but when he tried to go further, the fuzzy man would 'get mad and yell real loud even though he didn't have a mouth'. When the kid got scared at night, the fuzzy man 'made it go brighter' and gave him the twig bundle. He said the fuzzy man was going to keep him, but he had to let him go because the kid wasn't 'the right kind.' He either can't or won't elaborate more on that. The cops are just sort of left scratching their heads, and the search for his brother is renewed with no results. The kid has no idea where his brother might be, and they never find him.\n\n* The last story that K.D told me was of something that happened to her when she got separated from her training group when she was a rookie. They were learning the basics of high elevation belaying on a well-mapped side of the mountain, and she had to use the bathroom. She went off about fifty yards from the group during a meal break, and did her business. I'll tell the rest exactly as she told it to me'\n'So I go to take a piss, and once I'm done, I start going back to the group. But I've only gotten about five feet when I realize that I have no idea where I am. And this wasn't a 'oh, I got turned around' lost. I mean I had literally no fucking clue where I was. If you'd asked me, I don't even think I'd have been able to tell you what state we were in. It was sort of how I imagine people with amnesia feel, you know? You're completely lost, and you have no idea what to do. So I stood there for a while, just trying to figure out where the fuck I was and what I was supposed to do. But the longer I stand there, the more confused and turned around I get, so I started walking. As I recall, I just picked a random direction and went for it. And as I'm walking, it's just getting worse and worse to the point where I have no concept of why I'm on the mountain in the first place. I'm just trudging through the snow, and then I start hearing this voice. It's kind of inside my head, almost. Like if a frog could talk, all low and croaky. And it's telling me over and over 'it's okay, it's okay, you just need to find something to eat. Find something to eat and you'll be okay, just keep walking and find something to eat. Eat. Eat.' So I start looking around for anything that I can eat, and I swear to god I've never felt that hungry in my whole life. It was bottomless, and I think I'd have eaten just about anything you put in front of me right then. I had no concept of time, so I had no idea how long I'd been out when I hear an actual voice coming toward me. I go toward it and see one of the other SARs, and he looks fucking terrified. He's running toward me, asking if I'm okay and what the hell I'm doing out here. \nAnd the scary thing was, as he's running toward me, I kind of see myself reaching into my belt for my hunting knife. I'm not even really thinking about what I'm doing, but what I am thinking is that I have to eat. If I don't eat, I'll never be okay again, so I just have to eat. He sees me doing that and he backs off right away. He yells at me to put my knife away, that he's not gonna hurt me, and that kind of snaps me back. All of a sudden, I know exactly where I am, and I put the knife away. I run to him and ask him how long I've been gone, thinking he'll tell me I've been gone for half an hour or so. But he tells me I've been gone for two fucking days. I've gone over two peaks and ended up almost on the other side of the mountain, and if I'd kept going, I would have ended up wandering into about three hundred miles of wilderness. They'd never have found me. He can't believe I'm not dead, and of course I don't know what the fuck to think. To me, no time has passed at all. I don't say anything, I just go back with him to a rendezvous point and I'm taken back to HQ  to be airlifted to the hospital. When I get there, they do all kinds of tests, and try to figure out what happened. As best they can guess, I had some kind of weird fugue state, which is kind of like amnesia, or a weird seizure that knocked my brain out of whack. But the truth is that we really don't know. It's never happened again, but I'll tell you, ever since then I never go out there alone. People rag on me for making them come with me when I have to leave the group, but I just tell 'em that listening to me piss in the snow is better than losing me for two fucking days on a freezing mountain.'\n\n**EW:**\nThe next person I talked to was E.W, a former trainer who now works as an EMT. He still comes to ops like this to help out, but doesn't work full-time for us anymore. He specialized in finding lost kids, he just seemed to have a sixth sense when it came to knowing where they'd gone. He's a legend among the more senior vets, but he gets embarrassed if you compliment him on his work. He sat down with me at dinner one evening, and we ended up swapping stories. Most of them were just casual, but when we got on the subject of our weirder calls, I mentioned that I'd had a buddy who'd gone up a set of stairs. He got kind of quiet and asked me if I'd heard of a little boy who'd disappeared from his park a few years back. I hadn't, so he told me this story.\n\n* They were out looking for this eleven-year-old boy, Joey, who'd gone missing near a river. Of course, the first thought was that he'd fallen in and drowned, but when they brought dogs out, they led SAR officers away from the river and up into a very densely forested area. When we do searches for people, we search in a grid pattern, and we search every 'box' of the grid incredibly thoroughly. What E.W's team noticed right away was that a very strange pattern was emerging. Dogs in alternating boxes were picking up Joey's scent, but losing it when they overlapped with another box. If you think of a checkerboard, Joey's scent was being picked up in random black squares, but never in red. This, of course, didn't make any sense, because how could the kid bounce from area to area without leaving a scent in each place he passed? E.W and his partner pass into a new box of the grid, and E.W notices a set of stairs about fifty yards away. He tells his partner that they need to go check near it, but his partner flat-out refuses. He tells E.W that he's made it a point never to go near any stairs he sees, and that while it may be routine, he's not to pretend that it's normal. He tells E.W that he'll wait in sight while E.W checks. E.W says he was irritated, but he felt for the guy, and didn't push him on the subject. \n'I walked over to the stairs. They were small, kind of like stairs into a basement. I don't really feel strongly one way or the other about them, the stairs I mean, so I wasn't scared or anything. I guess I'm like everyone else, and I just prefer not to think about them too much.\n'Anyway, I went over and I could see that there was something lying on the bottom step, sort of curled up. My hear sinks, because of course you always hope for the best. And we were confident that we'd find this kid alive, because he'd only been missing for a few hours. But I knew right away that it was him, and that he was dead. He was curled up in a little ball on the step, holding his stomach. It looked like he'd been in horrible pain when he died, but I didn't see any blood, except some on his lips and chin. I radioed in that I'd found him, and we got his body back to command. That poor family, they were devastated. The parents couldn't understand how he'd be dead, 'cause he'd only been gone for such a short amount of time. And on top of that we didn't have any obvious cause of death, which just made it worse. I figured he'd probably eaten something poisonous, since he was holding his stomach when I found him, but I didn't want to guess. It's hard enough to hear that your kid is dead, let alone have some stupid SAR guy guessing about what happened. They took him away, and I went home and tried not to think about it. I hate finding dead kids, man. I loved this job but it's one of the reasons I left. I've got two daughters, and the thought of losing them that way just...' \nHe choked up a little here. I'm not great with emotional stuff like that, and it's always sort of awkward to see a grown man cry, so I didn't really know what to do. He pulled himself together eventually, though, and he kept going.\n'We don't always hear back from the coroners about cause of death. It's not really our job to know, I guess, and sometimes if they think it's foul play they won't tell us because of legal bullshit. But I've got a friend who works for the sheriff's department, and he'll usually pass along any interesting info if I ask. In this case, though, I actually got a call from him about a week later. He asks if I remember the kid, and of course I do, and he says some seriously weird shit is going on. He tells me, 'E.W, man, you're gonna think I'm crazy, but the coroner has no idea what happened to this kid. He's never seen anything like it.' My friend goes on to tell me that when the coroner opened the kid up, he couldn't even believe what he was seeing. The kid's organs were like swiss cheese. Quarter-sized holes were punched clean through just about every single organ this kid had, aside from his heart and lungs. But his colon, his stomach, his kidneys and even one of his testicles, were full of these clean holes. My friend said the coroner described it as if someone had taken a hole-punch and punched holes out of everything, they were so neat. But the kid didn't have a scratch on him, no entry or exit wounds. The closest anyone there had ever seen like it was a guy who'd filled himself full of buckshot a year or so back while cleaning his rifle. No one had a clue what could possibly have caused it. My friend asked me if I'd ever heard of anything like it, or if we'd had similar cases in the past. But I'd never even heard of something like that, and I told him I wasn't going to be of any help to him. As far as I know, the coroner determined the cause of death as something like 'massive internal bleeding', but no one knows what really happened.\nI've never been able to forget that kid. I have nightmares about it sometimes. I don't let my kids go into the woods alone, and when we go together I never let them out of my sight. I used to love it out here. But that case, and a couple others, just sort of ruined it for me.'\nDinner was over, so we started to clean up and go back to our cabins. Before we went our separate ways, he put his hand on my shoulder and looked at me really close. He tells me that there's bad things out here. Things that don't care if we have families or lives, or that we can think and feel. He tells me to be careful, and he walks away. I didn't a chance to talk with him again, but that story stuck with me.\n\n**PB:**\nBy pure coincidence, I got to talk to another vet, P.B who's been in the SAR field for years. We were partnered on a grid sweep during a training exercise, and we were chatting casually about how we liked the job, what kinds of things we'd seen, and the like. At one point, we passed an old set of stairs, though these were probably from an old fire lookout, given the area that we were in. I sort of casually mentioned that I was curious about the stairs, and that I wished I knew more about them. He got kind of quiet and looked like he wanted to tell me something, but wasn't sure if he should. Finally, he told me to turn my radio off. Obviously this is something we are never, ever supposed to do, but I did it, and he did the same. \n\n* About seven years ago, he tells me, he was out on a call with a rookie. They were in an area of the park that's had a lot of strange reports and events. Disappearances, stories about lights in the forest, odd noises, things like that. The rookie was totally spooked, kept going on and on about 'things out in the woods'. According to P.B:\n'The guy wouldn't stop talking about 'the Goatman'. Just on and on, 'Goatman' this and 'Goatman' that. Finally, I told him that there was plenty else to be afraid of out here that was very real, and that he'd better get over this thing with the Goatman. The rookie wanted to know what kinds of things I was talking about, and I just told him to shut up and walk. We crested a little ridge and there was a staircase about ten yards ahead. The rookie stops dead in his tracks and just stands there looking at them. I tell him, 'See? That's something you should be afraid of.' The rookie asks me what the hell these are doing out here, and for some reason, I just open up and tell him the truth. Or what I've been told is the truth. I could have gotten in a lot of trouble for doing what I did, and I could get in a lot of trouble for repeating it to you. But you're a nice kid, and I want you to stop looking into this. Quit while you're ahead. So I'll tell you what I know, under the condition that you never breathe a word of this to the supes.'\nI told him I wouldn't say a word, and he double-checks that our radios are off.\n'When I first started out, we were a little less tight-lipped about them, and other things that happen out here. We warned people before they were even hired that there was weird shit going on. I guess the Forest Service was tired of having such a massive turnover rate, and they wanted people to know what they were getting into. So they started having people sign these agreements that they wouldn't go to the media about what they were going to see. The FS didn't want to scare people away, so the last thing they needed were spooked rookies running off to the media with stories of ghosts and haunted stairs. But eventually, they found that the agreements weren't necessary. People not only didn't want to talk about what they saw, they wouldn't. A few times, media tried to talk to people when kids or hikers would disappear, and no one would say a word. I can't really explain it. I guess we just... don't really want to admit anything is wrong. This is our job, to be out in the woods every single day. We don't need to be spooked, and the best way to avoid that is to pretend like everything's okay. So I'll tell you everything I can think of, and after that, I'm done talking about it for good. And I expect you not to bring it up around me, ever.\n'The stairs have been out here as long as the parks have existed. We have records going back decades describing them. Sometimes people go up them, and nothing happens. Other times... Look, I really don't like talking about this, but sometimes, really bad shit happens. I saw one guy get his hand sliced clean off when he got to the top step. He reached out to touch a tree branch, and it happened so fast. One second his hand was there, and the next it was gone. Completely clean wound. We didn't find his hand, and the guy almost died. Another time, a woman touched one of the stairs, and a blood vessel in her brain exploded. Literally exploded, like a water balloon. She sort of stumbled down and came over to me, and all she got out was 'I think something is wrong with me.' She dropped like a sack of flour, dead before she hit the ground. I'll never forget the way the blood leaked into the inside of her eye. Before she died, I watched it turn red. I watched it happen and there wasn't a single thing I could do to help.\n'We warn people not to go anywhere near them but there's always at least one idiot who does. And even if nothing happens to them, something bad always happens. Kids go missing as we're on their trail. Someone dies the next day, cut in half in a completely safe part of the park. I don't know why, but something bad always happens. I don't know exactly why they're out here, but it doesn't matter. They're here, and if we were smart, we'd tell our new officers exactly what they're capable of.'\nWe were both quiet for a little while. I was afraid to talk because I wasn't sure if he was done. He looked like he wanted to say something else. Finally he spoke up again.\n'Have you ever noticed how you can't find the same ones twice?'\nI nodded, expecting him to continue. But he just stayed quiet, walking alongside me, and eventually he started a story about the biggest deer he'd ever seen in the park. I didn't bring up the subject again, and I didn't press him for any more stories. He dropped out of the op the next day. Apparently he left before the sun came up; he said he was sick. None of us have heard from him since he left.\n\nI'm going to stop here for the time being. I'll try and post the next part in the coming days, but what with it being the end of summer, things are pretty busy here. Thanks for the continued interest, guys, you've really awakened this curiosity in me that I didn't know I had!\n\n**EDIT**: Part Five is up: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3kd90k\/im_a_search_and_rescue_officer_for_the_us_forest\/"},"295":{"title":"I can see people's auras... and it's a curse.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/6xer5n\/i_can_see_peoples_auras_and_its_a_curse\/","flair":null,"author":"A10A10A10","selftext":"Yes, I can see people\u2019s auras. \n\nAnd I hate saying it so bluntly.  It makes me sound like some hack psychic who fakes the ability as a means of exploitation and a paycheck.  I\u2019ve never made money from my ability. I\u2019ve never taken advantage of it.  And, until now, I\u2019ve never spoken of it to anybody.\n\nBut I really do see them, and I\u2019m starting to view it as more of a curse.  I have a reason for typing this out and I assure you, there isn\u2019t a happy ending.   \n\nFor me, it\u2019s quite simple.  I see a faint light surrounding people.  Everyone.  And in that light, I can see their *morality*.  The brighter and more translucent the light is, the better the person.  The darker and opaquer, the worse.  Dim and partly translucent are morally ambiguous.   To simplify things, those are the three ways I describe them.  Dark equals evil.   Bright equals good.  Dim equals somewhere in between.  It\u2019s strange, I\u2019ve always viewed the people with grey\/dim auras as\u2026 arbiters.  Mediators.  The people in between, who aren\u2019t one or the other, and will always have difficult decisions to make.\n\nI was a child when I first became aware of my gift.  It didn\u2019t take long to figure out that the brighter auras were kinder to me and selfless.  While both of my parents are good people, my father\u2019s aura was quite a bit brighter than my mothers.  As a result, he was always far more patient and understanding with me.   It was clear to see that my teachers and fellow students with brighter auras were usually friendlier and more compassionate.  The dark auras were the stereotypical fighters, lunch money stealers, and bullies.  I would say I was around 8 years old when I fully figured out that I have a gift that most people don\u2019t have.  That possibly *nobody* else has.\n\nI\u2019ve read some of the \u2018new age\u2019 websites and alternative medicine articles that give their take on aura reading.  While I believe that the vast majority of it is bullshit, I expect there must be at least SOME other people out there with my ability.  So I don\u2019t want to completely dismiss those people as an outright hoax.  It\u2019s just that, for me, it doesn\u2019t work anything like the way those websites describe.  I\u2019ve visited numerous aura readers and psychics.  Most of them have dim or dark auras themselves, and I\u2019m certain they don\u2019t really hold this power.  I\u2019m not saying all \u201cpsychics\u201d are terrible people.  I\u2019ve visited a few who had very bright auras.  They were unable to convince me that they really have psychic powers, but they at the very least used their deception to try and help people.  \n\nYou need to understand\u2026 I\u2019m going to end this entry by sharing a terrifying event that is happening to me.  But before I get to that, I think there are a few more things I need to explain.  I imagine many of you are curious as to what type of aura is the most common.  I\u2019m happy to tell you that the majority of people are somewhere between dim and bright.  I see very few dark auras.  This isn\u2019t scientific, and I haven\u2019t traveled the world plotting out charts and graphs, but I\u2019d estimate around 60% of people are bright-ish.  Around 25% dim-ish.  Leaving just around 15% dark-ish.  Again, these are just estimates.  What\u2019s the precise difference between, say, bright and dim?  I have no idea.  But rest assured, there is far more \u201cbright\u201d in the world than \u201cdark\u201d.\n\nThe next thing I\u2019d like to discuss is children.  I can see a person\u2019s aura right from birth, and I\u2019ve never encountered an aura changing as someone ages.  I\u2019m not sure what this means for the whole nature vs nurture debate.  And I\u2019m not saying that everyone with a dark aura always behaves terribly, or vice versa.  A person with a bright aura might be born in horrible conditions, acquire a drug problem, and then resort to thievery to feed their addiction.  I think the difference is this\u2026 a bright aura thief with a horrible upbringing may rob someone, but they would never intentionally hurt someone in the process.  A dark aura thief would kill someone if they could get away with it without even a second thought.  \n\nAnother interesting note\u2026  I find the ratio between bright\/dim\/dark to be similar across pretty much all human activities.  Whether I\u2019m at a church or a death metal concert, it always seems to be around that same 60%-25%-15% ratio.  I once visited a federal prison and was shocked to see that at least half of the prisoners had bright auras.  I had to be at the prison in person to see this because I can\u2019t see auras on photographs, television shows, movies, or even in mirrors.  I can only see auras in the real world.  Another strange thing\u2026 I can\u2019t even see my own aura.   I assume and hope I would be on the brighter spectrum\u2026 but I can\u2019t see it.\n\nThe brightest person I ever saw worked as a social worker.  She shone so bright that it was difficult for me to even look at her.  Based on the way people acted in her presence, I think that almost everyone around her could sense her brightness in a subconscious way.  Everyone loved her. She had donated a kidney to someone she barely even knew.  She had a special needs adopted child.  Most of the money she earned was donated to various charities.  And that\u2019s only the little that I knew of her.  This woman shined so brightly that she scared me.  It was scary that someone could be so good.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t nearly as scary as the darkest person I ever saw.  I was 20 years old at the time, leaving a club downtown at 2 am.  A man quietly walked down the street.  I didn\u2019t see him at first, but I noticed the light dimming around me.  This man was so dark that he partly absorbed the light around him.  I looked at him long and hard.  He looked desperate, cruel, and callous.  When he looked up and locked eyes with me, it made me fall back.  He smirked, as though he knew what I could see.  I saw his face up close.  I would never forget it.  And I recognized it when I saw his mugshot a few weeks later in the newspaper.  He had murdered his ex-wife and two children in cold blood.  \n\nI think I need to get to it now.  The reason why I\u2019m writing this out.  \n\nI fell in love a year ago.  She didn\u2019t shine anywhere near as bright as what I\u2019ve seen before, but she most assuredly wasn\u2019t dark or even dim.  She was beautiful.  Her sense of humor, her wit, her.. everything.  She was my dream woman.  And I\u2019ve never told her anything at all about the auras I see.  I could go into far more about her but this isn\u2019t a love story.  What\u2019s important is this:  We fell in love.  She got pregnant.  We got married.  We were happy.  We were *so* happy.\n\nI remember hearing the buzz of my phone two mornings ago.  I remember my excitement when I saw \u201cIt\u2019s happening.  Come to the hospital.\u201d  I remember my frustration when I got stuck in traffic.  I remember how long it took to find a parking spot.  I remember shouting at a nurse \u201cWHAT ROOM IS MY WIFE IN.\u201d  I remember bursting through a door and seeing the smile on my wife\u2019s face.  I remember seeing the doctor, his light shining so bright, as he told me \u201cCongratulations, it\u2019s a boy.\u201d\n\nThe doctor held him up to me.  \n\nAnd all the light in the room dissipated.  \n\n\u201cNo, this can\u2019t be.\u201d  I remember saying.    The doctor put him in my arms.  \n\nThe darkness around my son was so absolute that I could barely even see him.  He was a void.  He was so dark that the world barely even existed around him.  It was like nothing I\u2019d ever experienced.  I started weeping.  I think my wife and the doctor thought they were tears of joy.  But they weren\u2019t.  Lord knows they weren\u2019t.\n\nI think back to the dark outline around that man that murdered his family.  It was up to that point the darkest I\u2019d ever seen.  But the darkness around my son was 100 times worse.  A *thousand* times worse.  And what could possibly be a thousand times worse than murdering your entire family?\n\nIt\u2019s been two days.  We\u2019re home now.  My son\u2019s darkness is so extreme that it dims the hallway leading to his room.  My wife knows something is wrong.  I think she suspects I\u2019m having regrets about having children at all.  If only she knew\u2026\n\nWhat do I do?  He\u2019s my son.  Just 20 minutes ago I stood above him, holding a pillow over his face.  But I couldn\u2019t do it.  Not yet anyway.  A man who could murder his two-day old baby boy: what color would his aura be? \n\nAnd here\u2019s the thought that keeps going through my mind as I sit here alone.  The fathers of our worst.  The Adolf Hitler\u2019s.  Joseph Stalin\u2019s.  Timothy McVeigh\u2019s. If their fathers knew what they would become, would they murder them in the cradle?  Would they have the strength to hold down the pillow as long as it takes?\n\nI can see the door of my son\u2019s room from my office.  The hallway seems to be growing darker.  I look down at my hands as I type this.  Maybe I\u2019m going crazy, but there seems to be an aura around my hands and arms now.  It\u2019s gray.  It\u2019s dim.  Maybe it\u2019s always been dim.  \n\nI\u2019m looking down at the pillow beside me.    The grayish dim outline around my hands more apparent than ever. Maybe it\u2019s time.  Maybe this is why I have this gift.  It all comes down to right now.  \n\nMaybe it\u2019s time.\n\nI think it\u2019s time.\n"},"296":{"title":"The James Webb Telescope discovered something terrifying in deep space","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/vuhfl9\/the_james_webb_telescope_discovered_something\/","flair":null,"author":"Phonecloth","selftext":"I work for NASA as an astronomer, and there are certain things we keep hidden from the public. No, the Earth isn't flat, and aliens don't control the government. Fuck, I wish those were the case, as the truth is much, much worse.\n\nIn 1993, the Hubble Space Telescope saw a star disappear. It didn't go supernova, or die naturally, it simply went dark, over the span of a few minutes. This star was already too faint to see with the naked eye, and ground-based telescopes had trouble picking it out from among the surrounding stars, so the event wasn't widely known to the public. At the time, we thought the most likely explanation was that a cloud of interstellar dust had drifted between Earth and the star, occluding it from view. It was noted and mostly forgotten about.\n\nIn 2007, two more stars vanished. Due to the circumstances of this event, this was much more concerning. The two stars in question were part of a binary system, orbiting each other at a fairly close distance. If a cloud of interstellar dust was the culprit again, they would have both seemed to disappear simultaneously, or very close to it. Instead, both stars faded individually over a period of minutes, separated by a span of about 8 hours. This binary system was also about 15 light-years closer to Earth than the star that had previously disappeared in 1993.\n\nAfter carefully reviewing millions of Hubble images, two more stars were identified which had 'gone out', in the years 1995 and 2002. These were all in the same stellar neighborhood, only a handful of light-years from each other. The only conclusion we could draw was that some unknown influence, traveling close to the speed of light, was shrouding (or destroying) these stars. Unfortunately, the Hubble wasn't sensitive enough to tell us any more than that.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope first came online a few months ago. Although official channels will tell you that it's still undergoing testing, we have been actively collecting data since early February. One of the first things we did was to aim the telescope at the regions of space occupied by the vanished stars. If they were being blocked by dust clouds (a hope some of us still held onto), the increased sensitivity of the JWST may have been able to see through them and confirm that the stars were still there. Unfortunately, we had no such luck. The first 3 stars that had disappeared were still completely dark. Gravitational wave detectors, though, soon found something odd. In all cases, not only were the stellar masses still present, but the amount of mass had actually increased. More sensitive observations had also detected a type of 'string', or 'web' stretching through space connecting these now-invisible stars.\n\nWhen we trained the telescope on the binary system that had vanished in 2007, which was the nearest point at which this phenomenon had so far been observed, there was finally enough ambient EM spectrum radiation left to try a mass spectrometer reading. If you're not aware, mass spectrometry is an incredibly useful process, where by measuring the patterns of light wavelengths emitted or reflected by an object, we can learn tons of useful information, such as its temperature, speed and direction of movement, and chemical composition. The readings we got from the binary stars didn't make any sense, though. First of all, they were cold - almost as cold as the surrounding interstellar medium. Whatever had happened to these stars had snuffed them out completely, or somehow prevented their light from escaping. What was truly puzzling, however, were the emission lines returned by the mass spectrometer. Several familiar elements, such as Hydrogen, Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Magnesium were identified, but these were few and far between. Most of the readings didn't correspond to any known chemical elements, and even seemed to defy what we knew about the physics of light, matter, and chemistry. This massive, star-spanning structure was primarily composed of materials that we didn't even have names for, and may not even have been matter as we understand it.\n\nSpeculation ran rampant. Obviously, such a thing couldn't be a natural phenomenon. Finally, we had proof of extraterrestrial life! But what was this thing we had discovered, and for what purpose was it being built? The leading hypothesis was that we were looking at a series of Dyson Shells - massive solar collectors built to completely envelop stars, in order to capture 100% of their energy output. Such a concept had been envisioned in the early 20th century, as a potential source of energy for an interstellar civilization. Ever since then, the idea had found its way into popular science fiction. The construction of these massive structures had actually been theorized to be one of the first signs of intelligent extraterrestrial life that we may someday detect. It seemed that day was today.\n\nThe theory still didn't explain everything, though. First of all, there was the impossible speed with which the stars were covered. Constructing a Dyson shell from scratch in a matter of minutes was beyond even the wildest speculations of scientists and sci-fi writers. Then there were the mysterious 'filaments' that connected the shells over distances of light-years. No one had any idea what purpose these could serve, or how they could even be built.\n\nEveryone at NASA was fascinated by this mystery. In hindsight, we may have been better off if we had never discovered the truth.\n\nLess than a month ago, the JWST detected a series of unusual energy bursts emanating from interstellar space. These were occurring at the very edge of a star system approximately 12 light-years from the binary system that vanished in 2007. As we focused the telescope on this system, we soon determined that these were not natural phenomena either. The energy signatures, which were still flashing intermittently, matched what would be expected from thermonuclear and antimatter - based explosions, along with several other types of energies that we couldn't identify. These explosions, although still not visible to the naked eye on Earth from that distance, were absolutely tremendous in magnitude - easily billions of times more powerful than any nuke that humanity could conceivably build.  \n\n\nAfter experimenting with the telescope's settings, we were able to get a clearer picture of what was going on: The tip of one of the interstellar 'filaments' that linked the Dyson system was passing through the Oort Cloud of the distant star system, approaching its sun. And whoever lived there was fighting back. Their weapons were able to slow the thing's advance, shattering, breaking off, and vaporizing planet-sized chunks of the object, but it seemed to be rebuilding itself almost as fast as it was being destroyed. After less than a week, the explosions stopped. It seems that they had run out of ammunition. In the void between stars, we knew that these things traveled at nearly the speed of light, but as we watched it approach the inner star system, its pace slowed as it swelled in size, preparing to devour the system's star.\n\nWe quickly trained the telescope's mirrors on the doomed sun. We were about to watch whatever this thing was blot out another star, but in real time. We all held our breath as we watched the projected image of the main sequence star, slightly larger than our own sun. At first, nothing seemed to be happening, but soon a small shadow appeared on the edge of the luminous orb, soon followed by another shadow, and then a third. The shadows began to converge, forming a strange yet somehow familiar pattern as they blocked out the star's light.\n\n\"What... are those?\" One of my colleagues gasped. \"They almost look like...\" she paused, as if afraid to say the next word for fear of ridicule. I, however, had no such hesitancy.\n\n\"Leaves,\" I said, my voice monotone. The situation was far too incredible to express any emotional reaction, even that of pure shock. \"They look like leaves.\"\n\nWe watched as, over a period of minutes, a web of shadowy outlines, matching the familiar shapes of oblong leaves and thin vines, proceeded to blot out the remaining light from the distant star.\n\nBy that point, everyone in the room had realized the truth. The phenomenon we had been tracking for so many years wasn't some hyper-advanced alien megastructure. Hydrogen, Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Magnesium, some of the few familiar elements we had detected? They were all components of chlorophyll.\n\nIt was a plant. An enormous plant that spanned across light-years. And, much like terrestrial plants, it sought out light to fuel itself. The filaments connecting the stars across interstellar space were stems - branches. It would grow in the direction of the nearest stars it sensed, completely enveloping them and then moving on. Any life inhabiting planets orbiting those stars would be left to freeze to death, or perhaps even worse, it was possible that the plant would devour those planets to add to its mass as well. \n\nEveryone was silent as the telescope continued to gather data. Eventually, after what seemed like an eternity, a young astronomer spoke up from the far end of the room, addressing our supervisor.\n\n\"Sir, we've begun to detect the formation of another tendril, leaving the system. Its vector is...\" he gulped. He didn't need to say any more, but he did anyway. \"It's heading directly for our sun.\"\n\n\"How much time do we have?\" the supervisor replied grimly.\n\n\"Judging by the time lag, distance, relativistic properties, and previously observed speeds of this... thing, I'd estimate no more than twenty-seven years, sir.\"\n\nTwenty-seven years. We had just watched this galactic weed overwhelm a civilization that was, at the very least, thousands of years ahead of us technologically, and we had less than three decades.\n\nI'll probably be found and silenced for posting this. But I don't care. I have to tell someone. I can't keep this a secret any longer. When the sun turns black and the world begins to freeze, at least you'll have some idea of what's going on, small comfort it may be."},"297":{"title":"Has anyone heard of the Left\/Right Game?

Maybe things are different on the road, maybe I\u2019d just never encountered it before, but it\u2019s clear to me now there are degrees beyond silence. A pervasive realm of deafening quiet which, following the loss of Eve and Apollo, our group has unreservedly embraced. Constructed out of our collective trauma, cemented with a cruel mixture of grief, guilt, and harrowing self-doubt, it quickly becomes apparent that this silence is stronger than all of us. The challenge of breaking it remains unmet for the rest of the journey.\n\nWe spend the next few hours burrowing through a featureless corridor of maize. The stalks rise far above the Wrangler, leaving only a thin strip of clear sky visible like the painted ceiling of a renaissance church. I find myself glancing intermittently at the CB radio, half expecting, half hoping, for Apollo\u2019s voice to crackle through the speaker, bringing words of comfort, or a much needed attempt at levity.\n\nAfter I catch myself staring at the radio for the fifth time, I decide it might be best to get on with my work. I plug my headphones into my notebook, bring up the audio files I\u2019ve recorded thus far, and set about creating a very rough cut of our first day on the road.\n\n**APOLLO (VO)** Everybody knows Rob, Rob's the god! Ahaha\n\nI listen through Apollo\u2019s first interview, making notes for the closing paragraph I\u2019ll now be forced to write about him. When I have everything I need, I listen to the interview again, and then once more. It\u2019s not lost on me that I just want to hear his voice, to lose myself in a pleasant digital echo, far removed from the frantic screams that followed him into the asphalt.\n\nI listen to Eve\u2019s interview next. She bristles with excitement as she talks about her upcoming visit to Roswell, steadfastly attempting to recruit me to the effort. She had no idea what she was heading into when she stepped out onto Rob\u2019s front lawn. Then again none of us did.\n\nThe thin strip of sky is turning deep orange as I reach our encounter with the hitchhiker. It\u2019s chilling to hear his voice after the fact, to revisit the conniving, veiled pleasantries he employed against us. I cringe as I hear Rob\u2019s hand grasp my arm, ashamed that I let myself fall for the hitcher\u2019s trickery.\n\n**ROB (VO):** You did good, I\u2019m sorry for grabbin\u2019 you. I just didn\u2019t want you to do something you\u2019d regret.\n\n**AS (VO):** No it\u2019s fine. I was going to. Do you know what happens if you talk to him?\n\n**ROB (VO):** Not sure. Came close myself once, a few years back. The way he looks at you when he thinks he\u2019s got you? I don\u2019t think I wanna know.\n\n**AS (VO):** Rob, I-\n\nI pause the audio file, clicking back ten seconds before pressing play again.\n\n**AS (VO):** No it\u2019s fine. I was going to. Do you know what happens if you talk to him?\n\n**ROB (VO):** Not sure. Came close myself once, a few years back. The way he looks at you when he thinks he\u2019s-\n\nI certainly didn\u2019t notice that at the time. I\u2019d been so shaken by my run in with the hitcher, and so curious about the abandoned car that I\u2019d been completely blind to anything else that had come my way. Maybe Rob misspoke, maybe he meant to say weeks or months. But if it wasn\u2019t a mistake, if it was a truth carelessly uttered, then Rob has some explaining to do.\n\nThe Left\/Right Game was posted online in June 2016, less than a year ago.\n\nI glance sideways at him, a wall of corn rushing past us as we approach the rest stop. Throughout this trip, every emotion Rob\u2019s displayed has seemed genuine. The sadness, the anger, the concern. They tell a story of a man who cares deeply about the welfare of those around him. Yet at the same time, it\u2019s strikingly clear that there\u2019s something he isn\u2019t telling me.\n\nWith every new piece of the puzzle, the car, the text message, the faceless creature with the ringing phone, I\u2019m left with the dilemma of when to confront Rob Guthard with what I know. I feel I\u2019ve gathered enough to bring before him, enough to demand an explanation, but there\u2019s no way I\u2019d be able to truly verify his answer. I have a collection of strange and perplexing notions, lacking in the common thread that could bring me to any workable conclusion. If I am going to confront Rob, I need to uncover that thread. Much like the greatest journalists of our time, I should know the answer before I ask the question.\n\nThe jeep pulls up onto a large green space. Staring straight ahead, I find myself puzzled by the way the ground seems to stop, as if the horizon lies only twenty metres away from the car. As soon as the engine cuts out, I unbuckle my seatbelt, climb out and walk towards the grassy verge. The rest of the convoy pulls up behind me as I go.\n\nI stop a few steps short of the edge, realising we\u2019ve found our way to the top of a sheer cliff. A sudden swaying vertigo takes over, forcing me to take a few steps back. It doesn\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve been heading uphill, the road has been level since Jubilation, yet somehow I\u2019m standing at the edge of a 400 ft. rock face, descending straight downwards, the distant earth shrouded by stalks of corn.\n\nThat\u2019s the truly strange thing about this monolithic precipice. On either side of me, the maize runs to the very edge of the cliff and, at its base, the endless harvest continues until it stretches beyond the darkening horizon in every direction. It feels like I\u2019m standing on the cliffs of Dover, staring over a golden ocean, its waves governed by the evening breeze. I wonder for a moment where it ends, then, taking consideration of the world I now occupy, I start to wonder if it ever does.\n\nA belligerent scream rips me from the view. The source of the noise is blocked by the Wrangler and the first thing I see as I circle around are the shocked, wide eyed faces of Bonnie & Clyde. Once I make my way past the Wrangler\u2019s hood, my expression mimics theirs.\n\nLilith has pinned Bluejay up to the side of the Jeep, a locked forearm pressing her chest against the door. Her other arm has been grasped in Bluejay\u2019s hands, desperately stopped before it can strike her across the face. The two of them yell through gritted teeth as Lilith struggles furiously against her, vying to cause her any conceivable harm.\n\n**BLUEJAY** Get the fuck off me you bitch! Get off!\n\nI take a few quick steps over to Lilith as Bluejay attempts to kick her away.\n\n**AS:** Lilith, we can\u2019t do this\u2026 Jen\u2026\n\nLilith doesn\u2019t even register my presence as she continues her assault, deafened by the bubbling vitriol in every growling breath.\n\n**AS:** Jen! We are not doing this now. Not after-\n\nBefore I can comprehend what\u2019s happening, I\u2019m staring at the sky, my head knocked back by the force of Lilith\u2019s flailing elbow. A hot, raw ache radiates across my lower lip as I stagger back, raising my hand over my mouth.\n\nBefore Lilith can continue her assault, Rob swings open his door and takes two short strides over to her. He puts one arm around the girl\u2019s waist and picks her up, carrying her safely, but firmly, over to Bonnie & Clyde\u2019s Ford, and planting her back on the ground.\n\nI seem to always forget how strong he is.\n\n**ROB:** Damnit this is not the time.\n\n**LILITH:** Take it back!\n\nBluejay has lost her usual snide demeanour, yet her aura still radiates an unbridled scorn. In response to Lilith\u2019s demand, Bluejay walks back to her car and sits on the hood. She takes the Marlboros out of her pocket along with her lighter, and ignites a cigarette. I imagine the burning embers are the only company she\u2019s comfortable to accept right now.\n\nBy the time I look back to the rest of the group, Lilith has stormed away.\n\n**AS:** What did she say?\n\n**BONNIE:** I didn\u2019t hear it all.\n\n**AS:** What did she say Bonnie?\n\n**BONNIE:** I heard something about\u2026 she said Lilith was\u2026 that we were complicit.\n\n**ROB:** Ah goddamnit\u2026 Bristol can you\u2026\n\nI watch Lilith, as she sits on the grass and looks over the cliffside. She begins to cry, yet I get a strong notion that it\u2019s not something I should interrupt. It feels like something between her and Eve, a final act of reactionary mourning reserved for them, and them alone. \n\n**AS:** Yeah\u2026 don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll handle it.\n\n**ROB:** Ok. I\u2019ll cook us somethin\u2019 up.\n\nAn hour passes. Lilith grows slowly calmer, drifting from cathartic release into a cold, wordless melancholy. Finishing up my dinner, I make my way over to her.\n\n**AS:** It\u2019s a strange view.\n\nLilith looks up at me. Her face falls.\n\n**LILITH:** I cut you\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry.\n\n**AS:** It\u2019s fine. You should see the other girl.\n\n**LILITH:** Hah, yeah, I bet she looks like shit right about now.\n\nI help myself down onto the cool ground, staring alongside Lilith into the ocean below.\n\n**LILITH:** Bluejay thinks I\u2019m complicit\u2026 in what happened to Eve.\n\n**AS:** I heard.\n\n**LILITH:** She used to think we were morons, now she thinks we\u2019re all in on it\u2026 doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\n**AS:** I think she he has to believe this place is a lie. She needs it to make sense, and the harder it gets for her to rationalise the more she... Anyway, she shouldn\u2019t have said what she said. She\u2019s just... I guess the word is \"troubled\".\n\n**LILITH:** She\u2019s a fucking thundercunt.\n\n**AS:** Umm\u2026 uh\u2026 ok.\n\n**LILITH:** She\u2019s right though... I killed her... and I killed Apollo too.\n\nI look to Lilith, concerned, not quite sure what she means. Her eyes remain locked on the impossible horizon.\n\n**LILITH:** Sarah\u2026 she wasn\u2019t cut out for this, and she knew it. She wanted us to turn back this morning\u2026 but I didn\u2019t want to.\n\n**AS:** That wasn\u2019t just your decision Lilith.\n\n**LILITH:** Yes it was. She uh\u2026 she followed my lead. Always. Through everything. And I knew why she was doing it. I knew. But I let it continue, because it was convenient, because it was easy\u2026. because deep down I liked having someone around who\u2026 who\u2019d jump through fucking hoops for me\u2026 god it\u2019s so fucked.\n\nLilith rests her head in her hands.\n\n**LILITH:** She was weak. She was anxious and shy and\u2026 but that should be ok, right? You\u2019re allowed to be weak that\u2019s\u2026 but I made her come here. I dragged someone who couldn\u2019t swim into the fucking deep end. And the last thing I did was lie to her and she fucking knew it.\n\nLilith takes a few deep, frayed breaths.\n\n**AS:** What do you mean?\n\n**LILITH:** I\u2019m not uh\u2026 I didn\u2019t, I\u2026 I loved her, you know as a\u2026 as a friend. It was always this fucking one-way street and\u2026 I don\u2019t think she minded but. Then suddenly she\u2019s vanishing right in-fucking-front of me and she said what she said\u2026 I mean how else was I supposed to respond to that? I had to say it back right?\n\nLilith maintains her composure as a steady stream of tears roll down her cheek.\n\n**AS:** I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do in that situation.\n\n**LILITH:** I could see it in her eyes that she didn\u2019t believe me. Fuck\u2026 I wonder how many people have died while being told like\u2026 comforting lies. How many of them fucking knew?\n\n**AS:** I think you did the best you could Jen. I think you did better than most.\n\n**LILITH:** You don\u2019t need to tell me that just\u2026 are you tired? Do you need to go to bed soon?\n\n**AS:** No, I don\u2019t need to.\n\n**LILITH:** There are some beers in uh\u2026 in Apollo\u2019s bag. Is that like\u2026 looting? Or is that ok?\n\n**AS:** I think he\u2019d want us to have them, as long as he got a toast.\n\nLilith laughs briefly and finally smiles. She walks over to Bonnie and Clyde\u2019s car, returning a moment later with a four pack.\n\nWe spend the next hour and a half slowly drinking them. Lilith can\u2019t muster the right words for a toast so we just say thank you to Apollo, raising out cans to the open air. We talk about his tireless humour, his attempts to keep us all up during our first night on the road, how caringly he spoke to everyone, even at the edge of death. \n\nWe talk about Eve as well, about the pair\u2019s misadventures, awkward college parties and the future of Paranormicon. Lilith smiles, and tells me there\u2019s always a place for me once radio dies out.\n\nAfter everything that\u2019s happened on the road, the night can\u2019t help but feel bittersweet. But for once, on a solitary cliff side in the middle of nowhere, it\u2019s more sweet than it is bitter. That may not be much, but at the end of an awful day it\u2019s more than either of us could have hoped for.\n\n*****\n\nThe next morning goes quickly. It\u2019s amazing how efficient a group of people can be when none of them feel like talking. Not only that, but breakfast has become a noticeably brief affair. I manage to get through half a bag of trail mix before I find myself uncomfortably full. Rob\u2019s words about the road\u2019s sustaining properties ring in my ears as I look around the group. Everyone leaves their bowls half empty. Lilith hasn\u2019t eaten a bite.\n\nBy this point, the launch protocol has been drilled into us. Despite our preoccupations, and the fractious rifts developing between us, the cars line up like clockwork as they merge onto the road. In fact, the mood of the group seems strangely procedural. All radio contact starts with the stating of a call sign, followed by that of the recipient. The cars maintain an even, careful distance between one another. We\u2019ve seen all too clearly what happens when the rules are neglected, and no one wants to take chances any more.\n\n**AS:** How far away are we?\n\n**ROB:** From where?\n\n**AS:** You haven\u2019t got to the end of this road right? I mean\u2026 you\u2019re still charting it?\n\n**ROB:** That\u2019s right.\n\n**AS:** Well, how long until we get to\u2026 you know to\u2026 uncharted territory?\n\n**ROB:** To be honest, not too long.\n\n**AS:** What\u2019s going to happen once we reach that point?\n\n**ROB:** We\u2019re gonna keep drivin\u2019.\n\n**AS:** Until we get to the end?\n\n**ROB:** That\u2019s the plan. You know I won\u2019t judge you if you wanna turn around. I\u2019m sure you can talk someone into it.\n\n**AS:** Could I talk you into it?\n\nRob smiles.\n\n**ROB:** \u2018Fraid not. This trip ain\u2019t like the others. Road\u2019s kickin\u2019 back like never before. I think it knows I\u2019m comin\u2019 all the way this time.\n\n**AS:** \u2026 What is this place Rob?\n\nRob sighs as he slowly takes the next left on a quiet, rural T-junction.\n\n**ROB:** I think it\u2019s a stray thread\u2026 runnin\u2019 off the spool.\n\nThe radio crackles.\n\n**BONNIE:** Rob you just took the wrong turn.\n\nAn instant drum of fresh panic hammers in my chest. I stare at Rob, and he stares right back. I know he\u2019s feeling the same thing I am, though he\u2019s doing a much better job of keeping it off his face.\n\nHe thinks carefully for a moment.\n\n**ROB:** No\u2026 no. I been down this road before. We took a right last time.\n\n**AS:** Uhhh\u2026 yeah. Yes. The turn before this one was a right, I remember.\n\n**ROB:** Ferryman to all cars. Thanks Bonnie for giving us the fright of our lives. We\u2019re on the righ\u2026 we\u2019re on the correct road.\n\n**BONNIE:** No no that can\u2019t be its\u2026 that\u2019s wrong\u2026 Martin tell them\u2026\n\n**CLYDE:** Our mistake Rob, let\u2019s keep going.\n\n**LILITH:** Bristol\u2026\n\nThere\u2019s concern in Lilith\u2019s voice. I lean over to my wing mirror, attempting to gauge the atmosphere in the car behind me. There\u2019s clearly some commotion between Bonnie and Clyde, with the latter attempting to gently remove the walkie talkie from his sister\u2019s hands.\n\nThere\u2019s something else however. Past Bonnie & Clyde. Past Bluejay. An old, dilapidated road sign made of weathered timber stands by the side of the road behind us. I can\u2019t read all of it as the peeling letters grow ever smaller, but I can piece together what it probably once said.\n\n\u201cWintery Bay \u2013 5 Miles\u201d\n\n**BONNIE:** We\u2019re going to turn around right?\n\n**AS:** Uhh one second Bonnie, I\u2019ll\u2026 check the map.\n\nI promptly switch off the radio.\n\n**AS:** Are we not passing through Wintery Bay?\n\nRob turns to me, a puzzled look in his eyes.\n\n**ROB:** Through where?\n\nIn the wake of those two, innocently inquiring words, my mind reels back to the morning of our third day on the road. Watching Bonnie and Clyde wander over to Rob to confess their transgressions with the hitchhiker, the quiet conversation that passed between them, Rob\u2019s seemingly comforting response. I\u2019d felt wretched in those moments. A few minutes prior I had tricked and deceived Clyde\u2026 yet I\u2019d never once considered he might have done the same to me.\n\n**AS:** Is it safe to pull over?\n\n**ROB:** What? Why?\n\n**AS:** Is it safe Rob?\n\n**ROB:** Uh, yeah should be.\n\n**AS:** Then pull over.\n\nI switch the radio back on and grab the receiver. As I make a connection to Bonnie and Clyde\u2019s car, it\u2019s clear that an argument is brewing. Lilith is asking for me, a helpless passenger, caught in the middle of something she doesn\u2019t understand.\n\n**AS:** Bristol to all cars. We\u2019re stopping up ahead.\n\nRob seems acutely aware that I\u2019m not messing around. As soon as we roll to a halt, I throw my door open and jump onto the dusty roadside, striding over to the rest of the convoy, who are just starting to get out of their own cars. I\u2019m conscious of a driving anger behind each step I take.\n\n**AS:** You didn\u2019t tell him.\n\n**CLYDE:** Bristol, I\u2026\n\n**ROB:** What\u2019s goin\u2019 on Bristol?\n\nRob\u2019s marches up behind me, more than a little restless to get a grip on my motives.\n\n**AS:** Clyde?\n\nClyde looks around a circle of expectant eyes. When he delivers his answer, he\u2019s unable to meet any of them.\n\n**CLYDE:** Bonnie\u2026 Bonnie talked to the hitchhiker.\n\nRob\u2019s expression shifts, his confusion degrading into a solemn understanding.\n\n**ROB:** God\u2026 ahh Goddamnit. You knew about this Bristol?\n\n**AS:** I told them to tell you the morning of the third day. I saw them go over to you I\u2026 I thought they did.\n\n**CLYDE:** Bonnie\u2026 thought you\u2019d\u2026 turn us around.\n\n**ROB:** Well she\u2019s was damn right. You seen what happens when the rules get broken. You shoulda told me as soon as you saw me and headed right back home.\n\n**CLYDE:** That was before Ace\u2026 before everything. I didn\u2019t know this place was-\n\n**ROB:** The rules are the rules Clyde! Is anything even wrong with Bonnie? You said she gets confused... was that a lie?\n\nClyde doesn\u2019t answer, avoiding Rob\u2019s glare. As I process what Rob\u2019s just said, I have to say I\u2019m surprised by the deviousness of the two siblings.\n\nWhen I thought they were telling Rob about the hitchhiker, it appears they\u2019d instead told him that Bonnie was, to some degree, senile. It was a simple lie, but one that would adequately explain her odd behaviour, draw sympathy from Rob and, most ingeniously, prevent him from telling me about their conversation. A truth buried beneath an unpleasant lie, its subject matter just uncomfortable enough to head off any chance of discussion.\n\nStill, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\n\n**CLYDE:** We can head home if you want.\n\n**BONNIE:** No.\n\nThe group turns to Bonnie. She speaks in a tone more decisive than I thought her capable.\n\n**BONNIE:** He... the hitchhiker... he was talking about a\u2026 about the village we just passed. I was looking forward to seeing it, that\u2019s all. I\u2019m ok really.\n\n**AS:** You\u2019ve been talking about it a lot Bonnie.\n\n**BONNIE:** It just sounded like a lovely place, I was sad that we passed it by. I\u2019m sorry for worrying everyone. Please don\u2019t make us turn around Rob.\n\nRob stares at them both. His position has been made crystal clear.\n\n**ROB:** We\u2019re stopping a little early today. Come the rest of the way with us, rest up\u2026 then tomorrow you both go home. You should count yourselves lucky you get the chance to turn around.\n\nRob marches back to the Wrangler, signalling that the discussion is over.\n\n**ROB:** Lilith, you\u2019re with us.\n\nLilith doesn't even try to hide her relief as she shuffles away from Bonnie & Clyde and climbs into the back of the Jeep. It\u2019s a little heart warming that Rob still has the awareness to look out for her, angry as he may be.\n\nAs well as his surprising strength, I also tend to forget how perceptive he can be.\n\nBonnie, Clyde and Bluejay climb back into their respective vehicles. I catch Bonnie\u2019s eye, the moment before she returns to the Ford. She appears truly disappointed, but otherwise resigned to keep going, satisfied to let Wintery Bay fade into the distance. It\u2019s comforting to hear that she\u2019s ready to put the place behind her.\n\nIt\u2019s just a pity I don\u2019t believe a word of it.\n\n*****\n\n**LILITH:** It was fucking weird Bristol.\n\nLilith seems happy to be in the Wrangler, enjoying the sense of security the modded behemoth affords, and also greatly relieved to be away from Bonnie & Clyde. She\u2019s spent the last five minutes detailing the thirty second argument that unfolded between them, charting its disturbing nuances as well as it\u2019s eerie conclusion.\n\n**LILITH:** ... but I swear she was basically like crying like\u2026 she didn\u2019t understand how we could be going the wrong way. But then like, as soon as you pulled us over and she just stopped. Like I mean\u2026 stopped.\n\n**AS:** That must have been disconcerting.\n\n**LILITH:** You have no idea... So Rob, when are these cornfields gonna fucking end?\n\n**ROB:** Soon. We\u2019re gonna rest up for the night in a few turns. Then tomorrow it won\u2019t be long until we\u2019re on a track through the woods.\n\n**LILITH:** The fucking woods? Are you kidding? Are we talking like\u2026 Sleepy Hollow bleeding trees or what?\n\n**ROB:** Hah, wish I could tell ya.\n\n**LILITH:** Wait, what do you mean?\n\n**ROB:** I ain\u2019t been that far yet. It\u2019s new territory.\n\n**LILITH:** Oh\u2026 great. Maybe the cornfields aren\u2019t so\u2026\n\nLilith goes quiet, transfixed by something in the rear view mirror, before quickly turning around to get a better look out of the back window.\n\nThe car behind us is out of control.\n\nBonnie is fighting to wrest the steering wheel from her brother. The Ford swerves erratically behind us, driven mad by the dynamic power struggle taking place inside it. Rob sharply accelerates out of the way as the car behind lurches drunkenly to and fro before skidding to a shuddering halt. Rob hits the brake hard, and by the time I\u2019ve turned in his direction, he\u2019s already slammed the door of the Wrangler, storming across the tarmac to Bonnie and Clyde. \n\n**ROB:** Cut the engine!\n\nThe Ford\u2019s engine goes silent and in the absence of its rumbling growl, new sounds emerge. The sounds of a struggle, and of wild desperate screaming.\n\nStepping out of the car for the second time today, I jump onto the road and cover the distance between us.\n\nRob is attempting to pull a screeching Bonnie from the car. Even with his impressive strength it seems to be a challenge. Bonnie claws at the walls, trying with all her might to regain her grasp on the steering wheel.\n\n**BONNIE:** Please! PLEASE! Let me go! Let me go! \n\nRob extracts Bonnie from the car and attempts to subdue her amidst a flurry of flailing hands and elbows. She writhes and kicks as he pins her arms to her sides.\n\n**AS:** Bonnie! Bonnie. Calm down ok? Let\u2019s talk this through.\n\n**BONNIE:** He told me it was on our way! He said we\u2019d pass through!\n\n**ROB:** He lied Bonnie.\n\n**BONNIE:** No\u2026 no we\u2019re going the wrong way. We\u2019re going the wrong way!\n\nBonnie lashes out again, striking at Rob\u2019s legs with her own. Rob holds her firmly, hit teeth gritted through every impact.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Bonnie isn\u2019t going to let up. I run back to the Wrangler and open up the trunk. After a few moments of rummaging through my bag, I find the first aid kit and pull out an unopened pack of white zip ties.\n\n**AS:** Clyde, open the back door.\n\nRob sees me standing with the zip ties. Even in the midst of Bonnie\u2019s incessant struggle, he looks at me with an almost questioning air, as if he\u2019s wondering how we ever arrived at this point. As if he\u2019s asking whether we can really do what I\u2019m wordlessly suggesting.\n\nBonnie answers the last question for him. In the slim few seconds of distraction, she slams her head back into his nose, eliciting a disgustingly loud thud and a pained growl from Rob. Dazed and confused, his nose immediately fountaining blood, Rob manages to keep his arms wrapped around her. But it\u2019s clear this isn\u2019t going to be sustainable, and that she isn\u2019t anywhere close to calming down.\n\nClyde has opened the door, stepping back and looking on like a frightened child as we carry Bonnie over to the back seat of the Ford. I lean in before him, adjusting the headrest until it\u2019s pressed against the ceiling, ensuring that it can\u2019t be removed from the bracket. I then loop a zip tie around each bracket and fasten them.\n\n**BLUEJAY:** What the fuck is going on?\n\nBluejay has stepped out of her car, making her way towards us. I realise that, to someone who is fighting to not believe in any of this, the following scene would appear at best as a melodramatic farce, and at worst, as the attempted detention of an innocent and distressed woman.\n\nSadly, I don\u2019t have time to field her questions. I climb into the car. Bonnie working constantly against us as Rob eases her in after me, his hand on her head to prevent it bumping against the top of the doorframe.\n\nOnce she\u2019s inside, I loop a second zip tie around the one I\u2019ve already fastened on the right bracket, forcing her right hand inside it. I pull the plastic tab over the sleeve of her jumper.\n\nI hope it\u2019s not too tight, but at the very least it\u2019s secure enough to keep her in place. Bonnie continues to pull against the zip ties, but it\u2019s clear her strength has been sapped from her spirited battle with Rob.\n\nNot quite able to look her in the eye, I push a pile of luggage out of the way and climb out the other side of the Ford. Rob and I are both getting our breath back, the former pinching his nose and adjusting stoically to the fresh pain.\n\n**BLUEJAY:** Hey what the fuck are\u2026 you\u2019re not going to leave her like that are you?\n\n**AS:** Get back in your car Bluejay.\n\nI walk back to the Wrangler, tuning out Denise\u2019s coarse protests. Rob reaches into the Jeep\u2019s still open trunk, and pulls out a pile of blankets and pillows. In the rear view mirror, I can see him placing them on Bonnie\u2019s lap, giving her a place to rest her elbows.\n\nShe leans her forehead against the back of the headrest. Even with her face blocked from view, I can tell that she\u2019s crying.\n\nWe arrive at the rest stop some twenty minutes later, the vague outline of a deep green forest blooming on the horizon. It\u2019s earlier in the day than we would usually stop. Rob tells us he wants the entirety of tomorrow to chart the woods, as well as good time to turn back before night fall should the need arise. I\u2019m not complaining, I\u2019m glad of the chance to rest up following today\u2019s events.\n\nFor the rest of the day, we take it in turns to keep an eye on Bonnie, making sure she has everything she needs. When the Ford pulled up alongside us, Lilith, Rob, and I expected to see a quivering wreck, tugging ceaselessly against her bonds. We were all surprised, and more than a little disturbed, to find her smiling. By the time my turn comes around, the sun is already dipping in the sky. Rob has prepared a small pot of miso soup in case anyone can bring themselves to eat. I finish my bowl, all too aware of how unnecessary each meal now feels, and pour out a helping for Bonnie.\n\nI find her in good spirits.\n\n**BONNIE:** How are you doing Alice?\n\n**AS:** I\u2019m fine. How are you doing Linda?\n\n**BONNIE:** I\u2019m ok. Sorry for giving you all such a fright earlier. I feel terrible.\n\n**AS:** It\u2019s fine honestly. I\u2019m sorry about\u2026 about all this.\n\nI gesture to the zip tied restraints. Rob has reapplied them, fastening bandages underneath the straps to afford Bonnie a modicum of comfort. Still the scene rings with a sinister barbarity which no kind consideration can make up for. \n\n**BONNIE:** It\u2019s ok. I wasn\u2019t myself.\n\n**AS:** I brought you soup. I know you might not be hungry.\n\n**BONNIE:** No no I\u2019d love some, thank you. Everyone\u2019s being so lovely.\n\n**AS:** Well, we just want to make sure you\u2019re alright.\n\nI submerge the spoon, drench up a measure of warm broth, and begin to raise it towards her.\n\n**BONNIE:** Oh no you don\u2019t have to\u2026 I can feed myself\u2026\n\nShe gestures to her bound hands, the clear implication hanging in the air.\n\n**AS:** No I\u2026 I don\u2019t mind. I think it\u2019s-\n\nBonnie throws her weight sideways, her elbow jabbing outwards and hitting the bowl out of my hands. Soup spills over my fleece, just a little cooler than scolding hot, and soaks immediately into the fabric. I back away reflexively, and watch Bonnie\u2019s expression flicker like a faulty lightbulb from kind tranquility to utter, burning contempt. It\u2019s gone as quickly as it appears, just in time for the rest of the group to look our way.\n\n**BLUEJAY:** What are you doing with her?!\n\nBluejay storms across from her car, angrily drawing from a Marlboro and forcing the smoke draconically back into the air.\n\n**AS:** Nothing. Just an accident.\n\n**BONNIE:** It\u2019s ok Bluejay, it was my mistake.\n\n**BLUEJAY:** Did she get any on you?\n\nBluejay leans in placing her hand comfortingly on Bonnie\u2019s, before turning to fix me with a murderous stare. It\u2019s almost impressive how, even when caring for someone, Bluejay still manages to be simultaneously venomous to those around her.\n\n**BONNIE:** No no it\u2019s ok it was my fault. It\u2019s fine. I\u2019m sorry for causing trouble.\n\nBluejay laughs at Bonnie\u2019s submissive apology, unable to believe what she's thinking. Her eyes remain fixed on me.\n\n**BLUEJAY:** You\u2019re a fucking coward. Look what he\u2019s making you do. Look!\n\nMy eyes follow where she gestures. I have to admit the helpless figure of Bonnie, restrained in the back seat of the Ford, rings with an innate inhumanity, and being forced to stare my actions in the face makes me feel utterly ghoulish.\n\nThe choices I\u2019ve made must seem insane to Bluejay, but that doesn\u2019t mean hers are not. Despite her pretensions of rationality, I can\u2019t help but feel that Bluejay\u2019s actions are simply being governed by a different insanity. An insanity borne out of the desperate need to explain the unexplainable, which has morphed into an ugly cocktail of paranoia, self-grandeur, and fervent antagonism.\n\nBluejay notes my silent expression, most likely taking it as a personal victory. Without another word she returns to her car and shuts herself inside, festering silently and alone.\n\n**BONNIE:** Do you want to know what\u2019s wonderful Alice?\n\nBonnie leans towards me, lowering her voice so no one else can hear.\n\n**BONNIE:** He told me there\u2019s a house\u2026 waiting for me. My home by the sea.\n\n**AS:** I\u2019m sorry Bonnie. I don\u2019t think there is.\n\n**BONNIE:** It\u2019s going to be a such a beautiful place. Such a beautiful place.\n\nBonnie flashes me a broad grin. \n\n**BONNIE:** It\u2019s been lovely knowing you Alice.\n\nBonnie turns away from me, placing her forehead back on the headrest. The grin doesn\u2019t fade as I turn away. I walk back to the Wrangler, faced with the choice of changing into new clothes or my thermal pyjamas.\n\nAfter removing my fleece and lying down for a just a moment, I end up sleeping in the clothes I\u2019m wearing.\n\n*****\n\nWhen I wake up, the Wrangler is moving. \n\nThe air mattress reverberates and my body rocks as we make a sharp U-turn. I sit bolt upright, Lilith waking up next to me, similarly bleary eyed and confused.\n\nRob is behind the wheel. The gear stick shakes as he transports us down the road at incredible speed.\n\n**AS:** Rob what\u2019s happening?\n\n**ROB:** Bonnie got herself free. She\u2019s headed for the turn.\n\nI pull myself into the passenger seat, suddenly wide awake.\n\n**LILITH:** What? How did she get free?\n\n**AS:** Is she with Clyde?\n\n**ROB:** She hit him over the head, dragged him outta the car. I couldn\u2019t wait for him, but he\u2019s catchin\u2019 up.\n\nLilith and I turn around. Bluejay\u2019s car is gaining on us, a distant pair of high beams steadily drowning the rear window in light.\n\n**LILITH:** Why\u2019s Bluejay helping him?\n\n**AS:** She probably wants to keep an eye on us. Rob, do you think we\u2019ll catch up with Bonnie?\n\n**ROB:** I\u2019m workin\u2019 on it.\n\nThe Wrangler continues to rocket through the darkness. We keep our eyes fixed forward, scanning the very edge of the horizon for any sign of Bonnie\u2019s Ford.\n\nWhen Bluejay pulls alongside us, I get a look at the pair. Bluejay is nought but steely determination, dedicated to reaching Bonnie before we do. Clyde looks mortified, rocked by his sister\u2019s actions, a small contusion on his head to mark her vicious betrayal.\n\nRob screeches to a halt once we arrive at the junction. Bluejay\u2019s headlights are already illuminating the road to Wintery Bay, and Rob\u2019s lighting rig coats the entire area in an artificial twilight. In the middle of it all, we see Bonnie, standing next to her car, smiling.\n\nShe\u2019s already beyond the threshold of the turn.\n\n**CLYDE:** Linda! Linda, please\u2026 come on back now, ok?\n\n**BONNIE:** You can all come with me. There\u2019s a place for all of us. He told me. There\u2019s a place for everyone.\n\n**CLYDE:** Please Linda. You have to come back.\n\nA strange trail of black dust is streaming off Bonnie\u2019s skin, rising into the air and dancing in the breeze. After a moment, it becomes clear that the edges of Bonnie are slowly degrading, converting quietly into dark ash and drifting into the atmosphere.\n\n**BONNIE:** I love you very much Martin. You\u2019re always welcome.\n\n**CLYDE:** No please\u2026 please.\n\nBonnie turns around and climbs into the car. Without looking back, she pulls away down the road to Wintery Bay. The trail of black particles rise from the Ford as she goes, with greater and greater volume as the entire car starts to wither away before our eyes. Less than a minute later the Ford, with Bonnie inside it, gradually dissolves into dust and scatters to the winds.\n\nClyde doesn't speak. His entire being is quiet. Lilith immediately runs back to the Wrangler. Rob waits a while, staring at he dancing cloud of dust, before putting his arm around Clyde and gently escorting him to the Jeep. \n\nAs I turn away from the road to Wintery Bay, I take note of Bluejay\u2019s reaction. She looks absolutely petrified, more so than I\u2019ve ever seen her. She impulsively removes the pack of Marlboros from her pocket and holds them in her hands, before quickly returning them, unsmoked.\n\nThe night passes slowly after we return to the rest stop. All of us are exhausted, and more than willing to surrender to the escapism of sleep. Rob rests in the driver\u2019s seat, giving up his space on the air mattress to Clyde. Everyone drops quickly enough into a quiet slumber, leaving me awake with only my thoughts for company. I find myself thinking of Bluejay, of how she could possibly hope to rationalise the disintegration of Bonnie and her car. \n\nI wonder how I\u2019d feel if the Left\/Right Game were exposed as some unparalleled magic trick. Would I feel foolish? No I don\u2019t think so. Impressed, maybe. Relieved? Most definitely. In fact, the more I think about it, the more I miss the innocent days when I believed the game was a hoax. I suppose I see why Bluejay is so adamant about dismissing this place; trickery however elaborate is almost always a preferable alternative to genuine horror.\n\nThe Jeep\u2019s door opens and shuts \n\nPart of me tries to ignore it, to wash my hands of any other developments in this harrowing night. However, exiled as I am from the kingdom of sleep, I slowly find myself sitting up, quietly putting on my boots, and letting myself out.\n\nI step out into the cool night, observing the figure before me.\n\n**AS:** Where are you going Clyde?\n\nClyde turns to face me, I initially interpret the look he gives me as one of resignation, but the word doesn\u2019t quite fit. Resignation is a defeat, the world exacting compliance from you against your own wishes. But the man before me is as calm as the night air around him. His wishes are clearly his own. There\u2019s no defeat in his eyes, but something else entirely\u2026 peace, maybe.\n\n**CLYDE:** You know where I\u2019m going Alice.\n\nClyde speaks softly, a quiet conviction behind every word he says. I briefly glance towards the Wrangler, wondering if I\u2019m really equipped to handle this on my own.\n\n**CLYDE:** Don\u2019t call Rob. I made a mistake coming back to the rest stop. I shouldn\u2019t have done... please. Just let me go.\n\n**AS:** Clyde, just wait for tomorrow ok? He\u2019ll understand. He\u2019ll turn us around and take you home.\n\n**CLYDE:** It won't be home anymore.\n\nClyde\u2019s gentle stare renders me silent.\n\n**CLYDE:** Linda had a husband once. He was a good man. Died young. She could never bring herself to go looking again and I\u2026 I never found who I was looking for. We\u2019ve been by each other\u2019s side for sixty years. Sixty years. I gotta be honest, even after all we\u2019ve been through, everything you and I have seen, I never felt like I was in a new world until now.\n\n**AS:** I don\u2019t think I can\u2019t let you do this Clyde.\n\n**CLYDE:** I\u2019m sorry Alice, but it\u2019s not up to you.\n\nClyde breathes in the cool night air, exhaling through his nose.\n\n**CLYDE:** I yelled at her to come back, when she ran off to rob that ice cream parlour. I kept calling out and calling out. I spent so much energy trying to get her to come back to me. After a while I realised she wasn\u2019t coming back\u2026 that I\u2019d have to follow her. I should\u2019ve realised it earlier. That\u2019s all I can do.... follow where she goes.\n\nClyde looks at me, almost apologetically.\n\n**CLYDE:** Goodbye Alice.\n\nHe turns away from the convoy and wanders back down the road.\n\n**AS:** Clyde.\n\nHe turns around one last time.\n\n**AS:** Do you want company?\n\nIt takes roughly an hour for us to walk back to the junction. In the time we have, I\u2019m treated to the story of Bonnie and Clyde. The warmest fragments of their life together, the moments that built them, the waves that rocked them and the places they once called home. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever agree with what Clyde is doing, but the more he talks, the more I understand.\n\nHis stories span more than half a century, supported by a transient cast of acquaintances and friends, but at the core of each tale is a pair of siblings who meant the world to one another. The pair existed as two relative souls, quantifiable only in relation to each other. In the absence of one, the remnant was indefinable. A drifting point, unanchored in space.\n\nThe story ends just as we reach the junction\n\n**AS:** I hope she's out there.\n\n**CLYDE:** I hope so too. Thank you for coming with me, I know it\u2019s late.\n\n**AS:** No\u2026 it\u2019s never a bad time to see a friend off.\n\nClyde smiles at me one last time before turning to face the road. He steps over the threshold, past the old wooden sign. In the silence of the night, I hear nothing but his soft footsteps and the quiet breeze, which after a few minutes carries the last of him into an open sky.\n\nIt\u2019s a long walk back to the convoy. My mind is numb to fear as I make my way through the dark, the corn rustling in the wind beside me.\n\nIt\u2019s been four days since I arrived at Rob Guthard\u2019s house, sat down at his table, and listened to him speak about the new world he\u2019d discovered. In that time, I\u2019ve seen things I can\u2019t hope to comprehend, sights that exist beyond the spectrum of our reality. Things I wouldn't have deemed possible.\n\nFor all I know there is a Wintery Bay, and Bonnie has already arrived at her house by the sea, standing at the door, waiting with quiet confidence for her brother\u2019s arrival.\n\nI may never know. But I do hope they find each other, wherever they may be."},"298":{"title":"Every month a parade would pass through my hometown, but we were never allowed to look at it","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/bk0322\/every_month_a_parade_would_pass_through_my\/","flair":null,"author":"EaPAtbp","selftext":"I\u2019ve lived in Arizona for the past fifteen years of my life, but I had a very different life before that. I used to live in a small town, in the middle of nowhere. I couldn\u2019t even tell you what side of the country it\u2019s on, or if it even is in the United States. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was a small forest town with dense trees in all directions, but where exactly this particular forest is, well, your guess is as good as mine. The only thing I know for certain in the name of the town; Point Pine. I lived in Point Pine for the first ten years of my life, before we moved the summer after my tenth birthday. Once we left, my parents never spoke of it again. In fact, they acted as if it never even existed, and to them, I guess it didn\u2019t. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don\u2019t really blame them either. I caught on pretty quickly and realized that they were trying their hardest to forget the memory of Point Pine. Whenever kids at school asked me where I was from, I simply told them I was from a small town that they had never heard of. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also learned early on that any questions about Point Pine would be met with punishments. A few months after we moved to Arizona, my older sister Felicity had a school project about family history. She did it on our life in Point Pine and wrote about some of the things she remembered from there. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur mom found her project the day before she turned it in and burned it in the backyard. When Felicity came home that afternoon, my parents took her up to her bedroom, where I heard Felicity crying out every few minutes in what I assume was pain. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI said nothing, and from that moment on, neither one of us mentioned Point Pine again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nExcept for me, right now. I\u2019ve decided to tell all of you about it. I don\u2019t know what is causing me to remember all these things that I had locked up in the deepest parts of my brain. Maybe it\u2019s the fact that my father died about a week ago. Since he died, my mom has remained silent; hasn\u2019t said a word to anyone. She hasn\u2019t even cried. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn fact, she ended up sending my father's remains off to god knows where (my money in on Point Pine, although I\u2019d be crazy to ask). I\u2019ve started recalling random little things about the town that, at the time, seemed like normal everyday things that we as residents were all used to. Now, as I look back, I realize that they\u2019re not as normal as I thought back then. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne peculiar thing about Point Pine had to do with the Point Pine Bakery. Whenever you went in there, the owner, Mr. Terrance, always knew what you were about to order. I remember the kids having some sort of rumor about Mr. Terrance being a magician who could read minds. Also, whenever you paid for your baked goods, you had to tip Mr. Terrance with an old item of clothing that you had grown out of. There was a giant box up by the register that everyone tossed old baby clothing and shoes into. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat was one of the odd things; although you\u2019ll come to realize that it won\u2019t seem that weird in comparison to some of the other things about Point Pine. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEvery year on your birthday, you had to get bloodwork done. I don\u2019t think anyone really knew what the point of this was, or if they were actually looking for something. We just all knew that our birthdays would start off with a trip to the Point Pine Labs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEveryone had to be up at 8:13 am. There was a system of speakers placed around the town like an amusement park or something, and at 8:13 am, without fail, the wailing alarm sound would ricochet through the neighborhoods, waking everybody up. This was followed by parents running to wake up their children and get them out of bed as quickly as possible like the house was on fire or something. Sometimes I expected it to be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll the Point Pine schools were placed in different areas of the town. Point Pine Elementary was towards the east side, Point Pine Middle School was in the West, Point Pine High was in the dead center of town, and Point Pine University was up on a small hill towards the south. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you hadn\u2019t noticed by now, every place in town was named \u201cPoint Pine \\_\\_\\_\\_\u201d. The Point Pine Cafe, Point Pine Mall, Point Pine Grocery, etc, etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCertainly, one of the weirdest things by far that took place in Point Pine, was the Point Pine Monthly Parade. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt happened every month; without fail. It was never on the same date, and each month, a student from Point Pine High was chosen to be in it. The weird thing about this parade was that we weren\u2019t allowed to watch it go by. Not out on the streets, not from the windows, and not even on television. That was one of the most enforced rules; you must never, under any circumstance, look at the parade. In fact, for the most part, we weren\u2019t even allowed outside when the parade passed through. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe always knew when the parade was about to start because it always happened the same way. You would hear a chorus of voices, like a church choir, singing a melody. It wasn\u2019t a familiar one that I knew (I was only familiar with it in the sense that I heard it once a month). It sounded like it could be from a nursery rhyme or something similar. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe voices seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere all at once. It was like they were coming from the sky, the ground, the trees, the buildings; like everything in Point Pine was singing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce you heard the first note, you had five minutes to get inside a house or a building that had locks on the doors. This might come as a surprise, but in Point Pine, not many buildings contained locks. So, if you happened to be out and about on the street when the singing started, you had about three options on the places you could go; one of the schools, the staff break room in the Point Pine bar, or the fridge in the Point Pine Pizza Shop. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne year in the month of August, my friend Lee and I decided that we were going to break the rules and not go inside when the parade passed. Now that I think about it, I\u2019m surprised that kids didn\u2019t do this more often, considering that well, when you tell kids that they must absolutely never do something...they often do that exact thing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince we didn\u2019t know when the parade was coming, where it started, or the exact path that it took around town, we decided the smartest thing to do would be to wait in the forest near the Point Pine Library until the parade eventually came down that street. So, we basically decided to spend about half of the month of August hanging out near or around the library. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAround the third week of the month, while we were sitting on the steps of the library talking about some random things that aren\u2019t important, we heard the music start. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLee and I looked at each other and then took off running into the trees, while everyone else raced to the nearest school. We went far enough into the forest that someone on the street wouldn\u2019t see us, but stayed close enough so that we were still able to see a part of the road. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe waited for a while, whispering to each other and then shushing one another as we waited for the infamous parade to pass. This year, my sister\u2019s friend Reid was chosen to work on the parade. She was a few years older than my sister, but they were friends because Reid used to live next door to us when we were younger. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe were crouching in the bushes and leaves when we heard the chorus of voiced getting louder and therefore closer. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cDude, I totally see it!\u201d Lee hissed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI straightened my back a little bit in my crouched position to try to see what Lee was seeing. I was always a short kid, even now I\u2019m shorter than most guys my age- or any age really- so Lee always pretty much towered over me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see anything!\u201d I hissed, shifting my position. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cShh! They might hear us!\u201d Lee hissed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI stopped moving and instead waited for them to get closer, where they were bound to pass right in front of my line of sight. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cOh no. Oh crap!\u201d Suddenly, Lee dove to the ground, landing in the fetal position, with his head cradled in his hands. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, looking from him to the street. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cI saw her! I saw that girl!\u201d He exclaimed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cReid?\u201d I asked, looking over to try to spot her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLee grabbed me and slammed me down to the ground. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cOw!\u201d I exclaimed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d I asked. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to look at it.\u201d Lee replied.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI noticed that for the first time in all of the years that I had known him, Lee looked absolutely terrified. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI turned my back on the parade and sat down to look at Lee instead. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d I whispered. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cThose things, they did something to her. They\u2019re eating her, Cody. But she doesn\u2019t even care.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI looked at Lee, who still had his head in his hands, and he was crying now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI sat with my back to the parade, no longer wanting to see. I heard the singing get louder, \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cCody\u2026\u201d I heard the voices calling. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look.\u201d Lee whispered. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cCody...Cody\u2026\u201d Now the voice sounded like Reid. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cLook at us, Cody\u2026\u201d \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI shut my eyes. The voices went on for a few minutes longer, and at one point, Lee started wailing. I kept my eyes shut the entire time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter that, it moved along and continued its way through town. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce we began to hear everyone come out of their hiding places, I stood up and leaned down to help Lee get up. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce he stood up, he kept his head down. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cLee, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI could hear him sniffling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cLee?\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe finally responded as he lifted his head. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cIt took my eyes.\u201d \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will never forget the dark, bleeding holes in Lee\u2019s face and the cuts around his skin. I threw up in the forest for a good three minutes, before I was able to help lead Lee out of the forest. A few adults saw us and got our parents, who came and got us right away. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe day after that, my family moved out of Point Pine. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI never knew what became of Lee after that day. Minutes after we left, my parents acted like Point Pine never existed. It was never discussed, and I never had the nerve to ask about Lee again. As far as I know, Lee was the only person who ever saw the parade, and he was never able to see anything else after that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don\u2019t know if Point Pine still exists, I\u2019d like to go check it out again, but even if I knew where it was or how to get there, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever go back. I have a feeling that I wouldn\u2019t exactly get a warm welcome. Although, I can't shake the thought that my parents were somehow still connected to the town, even after all those years."},"299":{"title":"A recipe for happiness","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/9ertpa\/a_recipe_for_happiness\/","flair":null,"author":"Dopabeane","selftext":"On my tenth birthday, I picked a dog from the pound. The pound had several beautiful dogs \u2013 huskies and German shepherds, sleek bluenose pit bulls and even a redbone hound \u2013 but the dog that caught my eye was a bowlegged teacup Chihuahua with wiry fur and ears that seemed to sprout from his neck.\n\nHis fur was prickly and he smelled like soggy corn chips. He also ate flies, snatching them out of the air like a clumsy frog.\n\nSo I named him Renfield.\n\nBack then, we lived on five acres of golden forest. My favorite spot on the property was a hollow inside a wild hedge. It was the perfect hideout; you could only access the hollow by crawling along a hidden trench because the branches formed a thick, dangerous interlock on all sides.\n\nI took Renfield inside the hedge that night. I remember the way sunlight shafted through the leaves and flowers, turning the space into a burrow of soft brown shadows overlaid with coppery light. My little dog looked up at me, eyes shining like amber in the dim. \n\nI petted him until he fell asleep. Then I crawled out of the hollow and called his name, intending to confuse him.\n\nHe panicked immediately, yelping and clawing madly at the impenetrable branches.\n\nHis terror felt like a gut punch. I crawled back into the hedge. The way he looked at me is burned into my memory: wide-eyed and joyfully relieved, but terrified. \n\nThat look was all I could think of the day I put him to sleep.\n\nI didn\u2019t have a choice; I\u2019d have him for eighteen years, and had medicated severe heart issues for four of those. He was in constant pain, so it was time.\n\nBut he knew something was wrong. He was so scared, and I scared him even more by crying. Tears always terrified him. \n\nI tried to push away the memory of that first night in the hedge, of the way I\u2019d scared him. But I couldn\u2019t, and no wonder. Putting him to sleep, I\u2019d trapped him again.\n\nOnly this time, I had to leave him behind.\n\nHe was my last lifeline. I felt him slipping away as surely as a drowning man feels a wave carry away his life preserver.\n\nMy crybaby tendencies didn\u2019t start or end with my dog. Take my dad. He\u2019d been in a nursing home for years by that point. He developed Alzheimer\u2019s early. The descent was brutal and swift. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, he had pancreatic cancer \u2013 automatically terminal and unimaginably excruciating.\n\nI stopped visiting around that time. Not because I didn\u2019t want to see him, but because I couldn\u2019t do it to him. Just try to imagine \u2013 you\u2019re in horrific pain, you don\u2019t know who or where you are, and your only visitor is a gaunt stranger who bursts into tears whenever they see you.\n\nI scared him to death whenever I visited. I made his disorienting, painful days that much worse. Stole what little peace he had.\n\nSo I stopped.\n\nI meant to sit with him at the end, when he\u2019d be in a drug-induced sleep so deep he wouldn\u2019t notice me holding his hands and sobbing. But I wasn\u2019t there when he died. I was at my doctor\u2019s office, digesting the news that I, too, was going to be sick for the rest of my life. \n\nI dreamed about my dad that night. He was trapped in the hedge and screaming for help. I tried to show him the way out for what felt like hours, but I was invisible. He couldn\u2019t see me or hear me. As far as he knew, he was alone. Somehow, in that irrepressible logic of dreams, I knew it was my fault.\n\nI woke up crying.\n\nIt was enough. I\u2019d had *enough*.\n\nI\u2019m not stupid or na\u00efve. Life is a tide. And the shitty truth is some of us live on a stormy coast.\n\nI knew this.\n\nBut I wanted a break. Just a couple of hours where I didn\u2019t feel sad.\n\nSo I went online, hoping to stumble on some kind of guided imagery technique or hypnotic ASMR. Something to create an artificially happy place, at least for a little while.\n\nI tried everything. Nothing worked. I kept searching anyway, trawling increasingly weird websites far into the night because the search itself was addicting. Not a happy place, but certainly a distracting one.\n\nSometime in the middle of the fifth night, I found an ancient Geocities page titled:\n\n*a recipe for happiness*\n\nI clicked, of course.\n\n*Are you tired of feeling bad? Want to cheer up? Well have I got good news for you. My friend gave me this RECIPE FOR HAPPINESS that works like a charm!*\n\n*There are TWO PARTS to the Recipe*\n\nWhat followed was a pretty standard honey cake recipe, although the last instructions gave me pause:\n\n*Mix the ingredients together in a glass bowl, then spit in the mixture*\n\n*Cook at whatever temperature you want for EXACTLY 20 minutes*\n\n*Cut in half. Put half outside your door. Eat the other half during\u2026*\n\n*PART TWO!!*\n\n*Take one HAPPY MEMORY and MEDITATE*\n\n*Think of someone who makes you happy*\n\n*Plan a perfect day*\n\n*Go to sleep thinking about your perfect day*\n\n*Do this and your sorrow will be eaten away!!!*\n\nIt made me smile. Eating cake while meditating on happier times wasn\u2019t bad advice. So I gave it a try. I even spit in the cake batter.\n\nI cut the cake and set half of it on the porch. Tendrils of steam twirled into the darkness, lit pale silver by the full moon. \n\nI curled up the couch to eat the remaining half. For my happy memory, I chose that first evening in the hollow: my little dog, lit to soft brilliance by the dying sun.\n\nAs for someone who made me happy, I picked my dad.\n\nThen I planned a perfect day. Or rather, remembered it.\n\nI\u2019d just started my first real job, and still lived with my parents. I\u2019d had a good day at work. My dog met me in the driveway, prancing and wiggling like he hadn\u2019t seen me for years. Dad cooked an early dinner and told jokes while my mom played her guitar. It rained that night. We went out to the porch, watching palm trees sway as torrents poured down. My dog was scared, so I picked him up and held him as thunder roared.\n\nAfterward, we ate brownies and ice cream. Then I settled in for the night and read a book until I fell asleep, with my dog cured at my feet.\n\nAs I drifted off, smiling at the memory, I swore I could feel him there: warm and surprisingly heavy, sprawling lazily over my toes. \n\nWhen I woke, that warm weight had shifted to my pillow.\n\nA terrible, painful hope coursed through me, one I couldn\u2019t even acknowledge.\n\nI opened my eyes.\n\nSomething tiny lay on my pillow in a drying pool of blood. Fuzzy and weirdly dirty, exuding drifting grey filaments that sparkled in the sun. Three milky eyes glinted over a horror show of a snout: cracked and bleeding, bursting with an improbable cluster of human molars. \n\nIt blinked \u2013 each eye just slightly out of tandem, opening and closing with a soft, wet *click* - and smiled. Ropes of bloody drool leaked between its teeth. It placed two cold paws on my face.\n\nThen it lowered its mouth over my own and inhaled.\n\nBreath and blood and every organ in my body seemed to travel up my esophagus. Like God Himself was sucking my guts through a straw.\n\nI whipped my head from side to side as the awful bottleneck sensation intensified.  All my guts were coming up, and so were emotions - no, *memories*: half-forgotten nightmares. Painful images of my withered father. The last time I saw my mother, dressed for work and setting a bowl of oatmeal on the counter while driving rain fell.  And my dog, my poor little dog, trying to run from the needle up until the very end.  \n\nI screamed into the mouth of the monster. I expected it to fly off, but it *inflated*: a furry flesh balloon growing, growing, growing \u2013\n\nWithout warning, it let go.\n\nI stumbled back, gagging. The monster \u2013 an engorged orb the size of a German Shepherd \u2013 simply smiled. Hazy morning light filtered through the window, bathing it in soft white.\n\nRage inexplicably built in my chest, growing exponentially every second.\n\n\u201cAre,\u201d it croaked, then burped.\n\nI wanted to kill it, to plunge my arms elbow-deep into its disgusting, distended body, and \u2013\n\n\u201cAre you sad?\u201d it asked.\n\nA storm of emotion \u2013 rage, disgust, contempt, even hilarity \u2013 roiled through me. Overwhelming, overpowering, and paralyzing.\n\n\u201cNo. You have no sadness.\u201d It poked its belly with a ridiculousy small hand. \u201cI have it.\u201d\n\nIt took a long, long time, but I finally realized that this absurd abomination hadn\u2019t eaten my guts.\n\nIt ate my feelings.\n\nNo sadness. No pain. No more stinging memories. Rage and confusion, sure. But underneath that was a satisfied calm akin to bliss.\n\nI left it alone in my bedroom and went for a drive.\n\nWhen I came back, I asked, \u201cWhat are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cA special treat,\u201d it answered.\n\nI decided I\u2019d had a psychotic break, and voluntarily checked myself into a hospital. After two days of assessments, they found nothing wrong. Why would they? I was on an even keel, basking in a curiously blank inner peace.\n\nWhen I got home, the monster was in my bed. Jolly, indecent roundness had withered to skeletal proportions. It looked awful. Starved. \n\n\u201cI need,\u201d it gasped. \u201cI need, or you will suffer again.\u201d\n\nThe prospect of returning to a life of despair, of *loss*, was crushing; I couldn\u2019t even fathom how I\u2019d survived it in the first, and felt I\u2019d never be able to do it again.\n\nSo I knelt by the bed and opened my mouth. The monster latched on and inhaled. The unpleasant bottleneck sensation returned: like my insides were crowding my windpipe. And with it, memories and feelings: the rage I\u2019d experienced upon meeting the monster; contempt at its ugliness; the fear of insanity. And more: my dog, old and grey, waddling happily after me. My father in his hospital bed, smiling uncertainly as he said my name for the last night. And more, and more \u2013\n\nI wrenched away, gasping. The monster smiled, fat and rotund again.\n\nOver the following days, we developed a routine. I went to work and attended doctor appointments, even visited friends. Then I came home and let the monster extract my negative feelings. Bad client at work? Removed and forgotten before the memory could sink in. Friend who wouldn\u2019t make eye contact? What did I care, my pet monster would take care of it like he took care of everything else.\n\nThat\u2019s what it did, you see: removed the feelings, the vibrancy, the *pain,* from painful things. Over the course of several weeks, it removed everything; I knew, dimly, that I experienced awful things on a daily basis, but I didn\u2019t *remember* them.\n\nThe monster removed triggers, too: before the year was up, the sight of my dog\u2019s bed no longer made me cry. Photos of my parents held almost no interest; I flipped through them on a regular basis, skimming places and faces that had so recently crushed me.\n\nAll the while, that peaceable bliss intensified. I flitted through life in a pleasant haze of calmness. My work life improved. My supervisor started talking about a promotion because I was so unflappable, so decisive. My friends were able to look at me again. And \u2013 for the first time in months \u2013 I was confident enough to reach out to them. \n\nOne day as I drove home from work, I realized I hadn\u2019t looked at my photos in a very long time. It\u2019s not that I cared, exactly. But it was a deviation. Those things no longer caused me pain, and I had nothing better to do.  So why not view them?\n\nI got home and obediently kneeled. The monster \u2013 now the size of a horse, twisted and bent like a mutated spider \u2013 fixed its mouth over mine. I\u2019d come to enjoy the process. It was uncomfortable and unpleasant, but familiar. And afterward, I always felt *happy*: peaceful, empty, and warm.\n\nWhen it finished, I opened my mother\u2019s photo album and began to browse.\n\nAfter a while, I realized I didn\u2019t recognize anybody. I remembered remembering them.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t remember them.\n\nThe stout man with curly hair like mine, the athletic woman who smiled like me, and the numerous people who wove in and out of this photographic narrative\u2026they all were strangers. \n\nI reached a picture of my ten-year-old self cuddling a ragged, homely Chihuahua. Ghosts of memories tickled my brain, urging me to remember, urging me to *know.* \n\nAnd I understood, finally, that I had lost something.\n\nI don\u2019t know why I cared. I felt so happy. Peaceful. My life was painless. I was great.\n\nBut I was also selfish. And I didn\u2019t like the idea that the monster had taken so much.  Where was the line between happiness and emptiness? I didn\u2019t want to be empty. I wanted to be full.\n\nSo, after many days of deliberation, I decided to make a change.\n\nI called off work, canceled much-needed doctor appointments, and settled in to search online.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d the monster asked.\n\n\u201cLooking up some special recipes,\u201d I said with a bland smile.\n\nIt took seven days, but I found the original recipe. At the bottom of the page was another entry:\n\n*a recipe for sadness*\n\nUnderneath were the words:\n\n*If you\u2019re really dumb, you can undo happiness =( You shouldn\u2019t, but it\u2019s up to you. So here.*\n\n*Mix cake batter folloing the INSTRUCTIONS above*\n\n*Cut your hand and drip your blood into the batter*\n\n*Cook the cake as instructed Above*\n\n*Cut the cake in half*\n\n*Give half to your Happiness, and eat the other half*\n\n*Now here\u2019s the sad part!!*\n\n*Remember the happy memory you meditated on*\n\n*Remember the person who made you happy*\n\n*Remember your perfect day*\n\n*Choose one to forget, OR\u2026*\n\n*Choose to never be happy again*\n\n*Or better yet, don\u2019t kill your happiness in the first place!*\n\nI agonized for days.\n\nMy monster \u2013 my happiness, my joy \u2013 continued to drain my pain, uncertainty, and fear. He quickly grew to three times his size.\n\nFinally, I made my decision.\n\nIt would be better to live in pain forever than to forget my father, my mother, or my dog.\n\nSo I followed the recipe: sweet honey cake, poisoned with blood instead of saliva. Then I cut it in half and brought it to my monster.\n\nI expected something awful. A fight that left my bloody shreds ground into the carpet. \n\nBut the monster only smiled. Round, flat eyes the size of dinner plates fixed on the blood cake. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cA special recipe.\u201d I gulped, but the beast was so focused on the cake that it didn\u2019t notice. \u201cJust for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d It opened its mouth.\n\nI placed the cake delicately on its tongue. It chewed eagerly, and shrank. Fat, firm sides caved, ragged rolls of empty flesh falling against its bones.\n\nPain built in my guts and chest, roiling and fluttering. Shivers wracked my spine. My warm, even-keeled peace shrank along with the monster that had granted it, leaving cold desolation in its place. \n\nBy the time the monster shriveled into a flat, boneless mass of dusty fur, I was prostrate on the floor, sobbing. Memories flooded back, pummeling me, leaving me breathless with pain. They pressed against me and threatened to explode *out* of me, pinning me in place. I couldn\u2019t move. I couldn\u2019t even dream of moving.\n\nI could only lay there and hurt.\n\nAfter my dad died, someone told me that pain is a fugue. It\u2019ll break apart eventually, giving way to happiness again the way a nightmare opens to the morning. But my experience is opposite. There is no fugue. Sorrow is sharp, it is devastating, it is painfully present, and sometimes there\u2019s no way out.\n\nThe recipe writer was right. I suffer every day, more than I did before. Like the universe is punishing me for those few months of stolen peace. It\u2019s bad. So bad that sometimes I think I made the wrong choice. \n\nBut then I remember my dad. I remember my mom. I remember our perfect day filled with songs and bad jokes and warm, driving rain. \n\nI remember my dog, nestled in warm, coppery shadows.\n\nAnd even though I hurt, I am okay.\n"},"325":{"title":"Weird phone call?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/31lhc9\/weird_phone_call\/","flair":null,"author":"Cinastar","selftext":"So, I've got a story. There are complications I need to explain first for things to make full sense. Mainly that I'm not good at making friends, keeping them, socializing, ect. But, I am pretty good at online games. Kind of. Point is, throughout high school, I didn't have friends in real life. I had one for a few years I guess, but she chose her shitty ex-boyfriend over me, so. Whatever. Mainly I stuck with a group of people I met on the internet. Good, honest people. Still talk to most of them after 5-7 years.\n\nI had an online boyfriend at the time that I decided to move in with, and it wasn't on a whim, honest. I lived in Arkansas, and trust me, it's the shittiest place in the world. On top of all that, there was a bunch of family drama and depression going on. So a new state? Hell yes. I know him inside and out, and he knows me the exact same. Two months after graduating high school, I moved in with him and his family. We kinda broke up last year but we're still living together (separate rooms) and we're still really good friends. Anyway, I started playing this online game (P2P MMORPG to be exact) about right when I moved in. I was super addicted to it, and played it for the whole first year I lived with my ex. I'll call him Pat.\n\nOver that entire first year I had been playing that game, I didn't talk to anyone in-game. I didn't make any friends whatsoever. I eventually made two. We didn't play often, but when we did, I hadn't realized how much fun it was to play with friends again. One was a guy named Cody, the other a girl named Beth. They had been close friends for years prior to meeting me.\n\nBeth and I had this thing where we would go around in the towns of the game in skimpy clothing and recruit for our newly made guild. A cheap tactic, but we had so much shameful fun with it, we didn't care. Most of the time Cody would join our Skype calls and sigh deeply in the background of our incessant giggling. On our second recruitment spree, Beth ran across a male character and started flirting with him. This was our tactic, and we referred to it as 'reeling them in'. Eventually, I caught up with her and joined in. Soon enough, the guy had a friend of his join in, and his friend became my target. They were both already in a guild, but we tried to convince them to switch over to our side. In the end, we lost, but not without friend requests.\n\nI didn't expect anything of it, as I considered myself lucky to even make friends with Cody and Beth. A week or so later, I ran into their characters in town. We goofed around a bit, and soon Beth joined us too. A few hours of dancing in-game and Beth suggested I ask if they had Skype. I, being far too shy for that, protested and outright refused to do so. She kept prodding me the whole night about it, but I never did ask. \n\nThen a few days later, I ran into them again. They seemed quite the pair, never one without the other. I could tell they were really close friends. We goofed off for a little, as was usual for us, and then decided to do some dungeons together. They were good players, and it was easy to tell they had been playing the game for quite a while. After we had finished, the original guy's friend had to go to bed. I hung around with the first guy for a while until he asked me if I had a Skype. I felt a whole new kind of euphoria and excitement. I always do when I make a friend, like actually make one. One to the point where they actually want other means to contact me. So of course, I told him I did and gave him my skype handle.\n\nRight off the bat he wanted to call, and honestly I was pretty nervous. It took me days to start talking around Cody and Beth, and then days more to eventually become just a little bit comfortable. I mean, I wasn't even sure if this guy was an actual male in real life. Of course, there was no telling I was a girl in real life for him either, but I don't think he really cared. So after a bit of stumbling, I began to hold an actual conversation with him. God, I was out of my mind with anxiety but the guy was so charismatic and friendly, it was easily to feel comfortable.\n\nI learned that he was the same age as me, and his name was Jack. His friend was two years younger than him and named Kean. I told him about Beth and how we were pretty good friends outside of the game, even though we hadn't known each other long. Apparently Jack and Kean had been friends for several years, even having met in real life before. That explained why they were so attached to each other. I found it cute, honestly. \n\nThe next day over I met Kean, and he was much more of a soft-spoken, sweet kind of guy. Not nearly as outgoing as Jack was, but still more than willing to be friends. I couldn't describe to you how happy I was. Making friends is a huge thing to me, and when I do, I tend to cling to them pretty closely. Neither Jack nor Kean seemed to mind, although Jack had much more going on in real life than Kean or I did. I don't have a Facebook, but the both of them did and showed them to me, so they definitely were who they said they were. Honest to God good and friendly people. \n\nThis continued on for a few months. Sometimes Jack would be gone at conventions and the like for a few days, then come back and tell me all of the amazing people he met. I somehow knew I would never amount to the people he talked about. For one, Jack's a cosplayer. A pretty attractive guy. Me? I'm less than average and suffer from severe lack of self-confidence. All in all, I considered myself closer to Kean. We spent more time together and he was more like me. Reserved, bit quiet when we wanted to be. Soon, my ex Pat started to play the game with us. He also became good friends with Kean.\n\nPat and I agreed that Jack was... overly flirtatious. It was obvious he flirted with me just for fun. I always refused him, and never played along with it. But I never hated him for it. I found it more demeaning than anything, because I knew a guy like him would never be interested in me. I knew that was just in his personality though. It wasn't as if I could just say, hey, stop being who you are it's bothering me. I mean, I guess I could have but, it wasn't as if it were causing me serious discomfort or anything. I knew it was all a joke.\n\nI... tried my best not to think low of Jack. We would have long conversations about how lonely he was, and about how all of the relationships he had were based off physical aspects. Most of the time, I became his pillow of comfort. I'd tell him he was a good person, that someone would come along, that he shouldn't worry, he was still young. It never really worked. I suppose it staved off the loneliness for a little bit, but it always came back. I couldn't blame him though, I saw a lot of myself in him. I was the exact same way, except... no one really wanted me in any aspect. We were so similar in how we felt about things. The emotions he went through and explained to me countless times, I understood them all because I had felt the same things countless times before. I completely understood him, or I like to believe I did.\n\nThere was one day that Jack was discouraged over a girl he liked. Well, more discouraged than usual. He explained he was done with her, that he was going to 'hit some other girl up to see if she was with it'. That was just the way he talked. After all of the long talks we had had before over him being misunderstood by others, I tried not to think anything of it. He wasn't that shallow.. right? He didn't just want sex, he wanted an actual relationship. I tried hard to believe this, but as the conversation progressed, I started losing faith in that. I started to get disgusted. He wasn't saying things that were considered gentlemanly in the least. I was fed up with it and eventually stopped replying. \n\nI soon turned to Kean. I kept asking him why he thought Jack was a good person. Kean explained that Jack had always been there for him, paid for a ticket and hotel room just to meet him, and that he was better in every way. I felt... so incredibly disturbed talking to Kean. How could he say that Jack was better in every way? Kean wasn't like Jack at all. Kean was sweet, and cared so much about every little thing he said to Jack. There was a time they had a fight, and Kean was so beaten up over it that I had to keep him company so that he wouldn't tear himself apart. Kean denied everything that I told him Jack had said.\n\n \"He's joking. He doesn't mean it.\" I quickly retorted with nimble fingers, \"Didn't seem like it to me, not at all.\" Kean continued to reassure me. I couldn't really say much, Kean knew Jack better than me. Maybe he was right. Jack was just having a hard time. I tried not to act differently around him, but his image was already tainted.\n \n I talked to Pat about this too, and he agreed with me. He was a bit more harsh in regards to Jack, honestly, but I tried my best not to hate him. He was still my friend. \n \n Kean and I had agreed to join another server on our online game for when we were bored. It was a role playing server, so we made up new names, back stories and everything. We were both really excited about it. Kean began to play on that server a lot more often than our original one. Eventually, he started to drift off from me and Jack.\n \n Sometimes Kean would join our calls but simply remain silent as he typed away in reply to his new friends. I slowly accepted it. It's always been a fear of mine to lose friends after the shitty one from high school. As much as I wanted to believe it wouldn't happen, I was already prepared for it. I'm just that much of a pessimist. Jack on the other hand was pissed off about it. \"If he doesn't care, so what. We don't need him.\" It was kind of sad to see how easily Jack would throw him away. It was nothing compared to the way Kean felt about him.\n \n By this time, Jack and Kean had left their old guilds to join mine. We had reformed the whole thing, had plans for it. Of course... none of it ever happened. Kean was pretty much gone by now, saying he was busy every time I invited him to do something together. That was alright, I was growing used to his distance. \n \n One night, Jack and I were in a raid when we met someone in game that we decided to joke around with. At the end of the raid, I had jokingly suggested they join our server. Little did I know, this person actually took my suggestion seriously. Pat showed me the name of his character requesting to join our guild right as I was about to head to bed. I had a good laugh about it, and feeling great about meeting someone new again, fell asleep with a good feeling.\n \n The next day I started to get to know our new friend. His name was Curt, and was a bit older than all of us. The more I got to know him, the more I latched onto him. It's just what I do when I first meet someone. Several times Jack had tried to get my attention, but it ended up being bad timing. I was busy talking with Curt one night, then the next few I had to sleep early for work. I suppose I could have added Jack to the call with Curt but, every time we all were in a call it felt a bit awkward and strained. I don't think Jack liked Curt very well. I figured it was because I was no longer paying all of my attention to Jack, and I was kind of done with him acting like a kid about it.\n \n That weekend was a huge convention that Jack went off to. I was used to not talking to him for a few days because he was busy. It was never something that bothered me. I initiated conversation with Jack several times but we never really talked unless he initiated conversation with me. Mostly then it was about how sad he was feeling about this and that, and I kind of grew tired of it. This kid bitched about every little thing and hated his life over every small mishap that it made me so annoyed. Here I was, or still am technically, with full fledged depression, poor looks, and nearly no money, compared to him who had... well, everything. I understood that he had every right to feel what he did because that's how emotions work. Then again, it frustrated me. I never complained as much as him.\n \n By the time he came back, he suddenly told me we weren't friends any more. Completely out of the fucking blue. I was confused to say the least. I told him we could talk it out, or he could just act like nothing happened. And well, he chose the latter. I said, \"Fine, I guess we aren't friends any more.\" He replied with \"Fine, goodbye Amy.\" And that was the last I spoke with him on the matter.\n \n It tore me up for a long time. I had lost both Jack and Kean in such a short amount of time. I supposed at least I had Curt to talk to. He was comforting. A bit of a realist and definitely blunt, but, he said everything I needed to hear. No sugar coating, just cold reality. \n \n \"People can be like that. If he's fine with throwing you away that easily, he was never really your friend to begin with. He just wanted attention.\"\n \n A few days after, I talked to Kean about it. The first I had talked to him in probably a month. He replied with things like, \"What? Why would he do that... I have no clue...\" I explained that it happened out of nowhere. That he never told me what was wrong but it happened, and I was done with it. I was too grown up for kids games like that. And that was the last I had talked to Kean.\n \n Pat had received a message on Facebook from Jack telling him that he still wanted to be friends with him, just not me. Pat asked why, and finally I got some fucking answers. Apparently Kean had told Jack about the conversation we had had a while ago, about how I was losing faith in Jack being a good person. And just to note, this was maybe two or three months before Kean eventually told him. I just wanted reassurance. I'm not trying to justify myself but I wanted someone to tell me he was a good person. I know I should have talked to Jack about it. Then again, our friendship probably could have ended a lot sooner than it did. Jack apparently started hating me, and eventually wanted to cut all ties with me. Fine, I was done with it.\n \n That all was a month ago.\n \n Not even a week ago I had a missed phone call at 11:47 at night. My phone was on silent, so I hadn't seen it until I had rolled over and checked my phone probably ten minutes later. The number was unknown, but the area code wasn't from around where I lived. I Googled it and found it was from the state Kean lived in. Now, I had deleted both Kean and Jack's phone numbers, Skype handles, everything. Thinking logically, Kean was the only one that had my number from that state, unless it were some weird phone scam. I noticed that I had a voice mail. From my T-Mobile Visual Voicemail app, it told me that the message was three minutes long. Huh. Okay.\n \n I pressed play on the message and it was entirely silent. There was a soft noise that could be heard every second or so, a sound I recognized as sleeping. There was a time that Kean had fallen asleep on a Skype call, and he had this cute little snore that I remember fawning over. I recognized it as his. Well, he must have accidentally dialed me, I supposed. I listened to the message for about a minute, but finding nothing strange, closed the voicemail and went back to sleep. I was a little creeped out, but knew it was nothing important. I expected to get some kind of text message in the morning from him saying \"I accidentally called you last night, haha. Sorry.\"\n \n That text message never came. I figured maybe it was because we hadn't really talked for the last month, that we weren't nearly as close as we used to be so it would be strange to say that. I don't know, I was just making shit up to stop myself from thinking 'not even Kean cared about you'.\n \n Yesterday evening I got a message from an unknown Skype handle.\n \n[10:08:05 PM] ---- : Have you heard from Kean?\n\nThe only person that would message me on Skype like that would most likely be Jack. \n\n[10:08:34 PM] ---- : Did he call you? Or leave you a weird voice message?\n\nI decided I'd humor him a bit. I was still a bit resentful towards him, but it was a harmless question.\n\n[10:10:54 PM] Cinastar : Uh. Yeah, he called but it wasn't a weird voicemail. He was just sleeping. I figured it was an accident. I haven't heard from him since, figured he was busy with school.\n\n[10:11:02 PM] ---- : You didn't listen to the end of the voicemail did you?\n\n[10:11:48 PM] Cinastar : .. It was 3 minutes long why would I listen to all of that. I assume he accidentally called you too? Weird, I guess.\n\n[10:13:02 PM] ---- : Amy, that wasn't an accident.\n\nI didn't know what to say because I figured he was freaking me out on purpose, so I didn't reply.\n\n[10:15:22 PM] ---- : Something's wrong.\n\nI don't know what he means by that. I've been too busy with work today that I haven't bothered with the message. I'm pretty skeptical that it's anything important, but I'm going to listen to it eventually. It's actually scaring me a little bit. I just wanted some feedback as to what someone else thinks it is. Pat thinks it's a joke and nothing to worry about, but.. I don't know. It's kind of exciting to think it might be something, right? "},"326":{"title":"Why the cruelty of others is far more scary than the paranormal.

As I was waiting, I overheard the man behind me talking on the phone. One phrase caught my attention:\n\n\"\u2026Yeah, I'll put the bookshelf up on Craigslist tomorrow.\"\n\nIt seems totally random, yes, but I was actually looking for a bookshelf. After he hung up, I turned around and said that I heard him mention selling a bookshelf and asked what it looked like. He described it as black, maybe six and a half feet tall and about four feet long. It sounded like what I was looking for, so I asked how much he wanted for it. He said $35, which was good enough for me. I told him that I might be interested in buying it and he mentioned that he lived nearby. We decided that I should just follow him home and take a look. \n\nThis guy was in his late forties or early fifties. He was living in a basement apartment, but I didn't think much of it. I followed him in and he pointed me to his office, where the bookshelf was. I was told to just go take a look, as he wanted to grab something to drink. He asked if I wanted anything, which I didn't. I inspected the bookshelf as I waited for him to come back and it looked good. \n\nWhen the guy came back, I got knocked over. He gagged and handcuffed me, then dragged me out of the office and into his bedroom.\n\nI've been trying all day to write a narrative of what happened next. It's just too difficult to go through it in that sort of detail, though. I think that for now, I'm just going to have to list the events and relevant facts. Sorry it's not in story form, but it's still too traumatizing to fully explain.\n\n\u2022 I was put inside an empty closet, which the man then proceeded to barricade shut.\n\n\u2022 I was left there for what seemed like a really long time, but it was probably really an hour or two.\n\n\u2022 As I was in the closet, I managed to get a bobby pin out of my hair. I learned to pick handcuffs a couple of years ago, but haven't practice in a while. I spent a fair amount of time trying to get the plasticky stuff off the ends. (Why is it that on some bobby pins, they always slide of way too easily and on others, it practically takes a razor blade to scrape them off?) \n\n\u2022 I eventually decided that even if I got the handcuffs off, it wouldn't do me much good, as he was larger and stronger than me and even if I could surprise him with not being handcuffed when he opened the closet, I probably couldn't do much more. I finished scraping off the bobby pin, bent it into the right shape and tucked it away for later use, if necessary.\n\n\u2022 When he came back, he took me out of the closet and tied me to his bed. He had a duffle bag with him. It looked like it had sat in an attic for a while. \n\n\u2022 As he was going through his duffle bag looking for something, his cell phone rang. He turned on the radio in the bedroom, answered it and closed the door behind him as he went to a different room to talk. As a result, I didn't hear what was going on. It felt like he didn't want me to hear, though.\n\n\u2022 I tried to look around the room and familiarize myself with anything I could use as an improvised weapon. The place was pretty empty, so there wasn't much. I noticed that in the laundry basket, there was a pair of jeans with a belt still on it. I saw a can of black spray paint. I was desperate for anything.\n\n\u2022 Ten minutes later (again, a best guess), he came back. \n\n\u2022 Okay, this is when it gets really difficult. It'll probably be a lot of information in a few sentences and while I wish I was able to better explain, it's just too hard.\n\n\u2022 He grabbed something out of his duffle bag. It reminded me of one of those head massager things, but more flexible and with sticky pads at the ends.\n\n\u2022 He affixed it to my head, somewhat covering my face. He said something along the lines of, \"I want you to remember one thing and one thing only: You don't mess with us. You stay away. Back off and it's better for all of us.\"\n\n\u2022 He plugged the head device into some kind of little machine and I felt these electrical currents. It wasn't quite like being shocked, but it was very uncomfortable nonetheless. They also gave me a really bad migraine.\n\n\u2022 At this point I've realized that this isn't just a random crazy - this guy is part of the network. When he finishes using the machine however, I just try to act really disoriented and like I don't know where I am. I still remembered everything (probably as a result of the chip malfunctioning), but he seemed to be satisfied that I had my memory erased.\n\n\u2022 While that seemed like a good idea at the time, in retrospect I'm not sure what the wisest thing to do would have been. \n\n\u2022 He raped me.\n\n\u2022 He hooked me up again and \"erased\" my memory.\n\n\u2022 I had to be all disoriented again.\n\n\u2022 He left me tied up in the closet again.\n\n\u2022 He later took me out and raped me again.\n\n\u2022 I think you get the drill by now. This happened for a while.\n\nI feel like at this point I'm useless at telling this story. I'm super upset. It's taken all day to do this. I can't keep going. I wish that it had worked and that I didn't remember. He was sick and terrible. I don't want to remember. I want it to stop."},"327":{"title":"Why the cruelty of others is far more scary than the paranormal.

While I stand by that this is my experience and that I am writing this account as a way of getting this information out there, not as entertainment, I would like to address those who don't believe me.\n\nWhile I have been aware all along that there would be people skeptical of my story, I chose nosleep for a reason. As an online community, you give people the benefit of the doubt long enough to hear them out. If you don't believe, you can downvote and leave. I prioritized answering comments, but last night I just gave up. I am having a hard enough time dealing with all of this to have to constantly answer to increasingly mean remarks.\n\nThe types of cruel, insensitive comments I have been getting are uncalled for. Some of the PMs are even worse. Some of you are making me feel genuinely threatened. Others are just making me feel really discouraged and more firm in my belief that the world really is a cruel place. Several of you have suggested that I am crazy. If that is the case, *why are you trying to make things worse for me?*\n\nIf you sincerely believe I'm making this up, then consider this a \"the terrorists have won\" situation: You have drastically changed the way this subreddit behaves based on one story. What made nosleep amazing was the \"everything is true\" mentality. That just got shattered.\n\nIf I was making potentially libelous statements against a specific individual or organization, I could see this type of behavior being more justified. But I have not. I have not said, \"Here is this person \u2013 harass him because he did bad things.\" Your behavior is seriously unwarranted.\n\nA specific set of comments I would like to address are the ones about how I \"didn't tell the police.\" If you are marketing yourselves as psychics, change professions. Where I left off last night, I was still being held hostage. Calling the police was not even an option yet. Even worse than giving me flack for what I did do is being overly critical of something that didn't even happen. \n\nAdditionally, I feel that the type of victim blaming that accuses me of enabling future rapes by not reporting is especially insensitive. Most rapes are not reported and you are not just hurting me, but any other victim of rape that have chosen to not involve the police. It's a very personal decision and the aftermath of rape is grueling enough without a bunch of uninvolved parties intruding on you and questioning your story to no end.\n\nIn contrast,  there have been several of you that have been extremely kind and supportive. I have gotten many responses of people willing to hold my file and I've emailed it to two of you. I trust these people to deny having it, so don't expect it to show up. To clarify, they will only be able to open the file and distribute it if I am reported missing or dead. A report needs to be made in order for the file holders to access the data. You'll never figure it out otherwise.\n\nSo thank you to those of you who have been kind to me. Because of you, here comes the last part.\n\nBut first, **here is the end you should read if you don't believe me:**\n\n*I woke up and it was all one big, terrible nightmare.*\n\nGo complain about that now.\n\nFor the rest of you, here's what really happened.\n\nThis went on throughout the night. I don't think it's necessary to go into too much detail. But whether or not I was being raped, I was hooked up to the device at least once every two hours.\n\nAt around 4:00 a.m., he took me out to my car. He had my keys, so he drove us to a church parking lot the next town over. He made a phone call simply consisting of, \"I'm ready,\" then started hooking me up to the device one last time. We wait for a few minutes, then another car pulls up. A man in a ski mask gets out and together they move me over to the driver's seat. As the first man uses the device to presumably remove my memory, the other removes my handcuffs and the gag. Then the device is swiftly detached and they hurry to the other car.\n\nPresumably, I'm waking up in a church parking lot with no memory of the last thirteen hours or so. I sat there for about ten minutes, just in shock. I knew that if I had been found and taken, the others in the group could have it happen to them, too \u2013 with possibly worse consequences. This was enough motivation for me to report the incident. While it might not stop every member of the network, having one or two of them behind bars would at least be a start and maybe serve as a warning.\n\nI needed some time to figure out what to tell the police, so I started by driving to the nearest hospital. I went in, explained that I had just been raped and they started their standard procedures. They checked me medically, performed a rape kit and asked what I wanted to do as far as police involvement. I told them that I was fine with them contacting the police and by the time they finished gathering evidence and taking care of me, an officer had arrived.\n\nI had to tell him the truth to a certain degree, but I didn't feel like going into the microchip stuff was productive at this point. The story was that I was buying this guy's bookshelf, but that he then held me hostage and repeatedly raped me. As for how I got out, I said that at some point I had passed out or fallen asleep from exhaustion and that I had woken up in my car at the church parking lot. \n\nBecause I had a description of the guy, knew where he (presumably) lived, had gotten the police involved early and was stating some pretty serious accusations, the officer got a detective involved immediately. I was taken over to the police station and they took my car to search for evidence.\n\nI spent the morning and afternoon in interview after interview. Based on the marks on my arms from the handcuffs, the initial assessment of the sexual assault nurse examiner and the evidence she found, having information on where the guy might be, and me staying consistent in my story, they were ready to act. They told me that they were going to go talk to him, probably arrest him and call me that evening. My victim's advocate got me a prepaid phone to use until I could get a new cell phone (the man had taken my old one and presumably destroyed it) and arranged for a rental car while they examined mine.\n\nI came home exhausted and completely drained. I needed to sleep, but was terrified. I locked myself in, then barricaded the door to my bedroom. I secured the window, too, as best I could. I put some clothes under my blankets to make it look like someone was there and went to sleep under the bed, clutching the prepaid phone.\n\nFive hours later, I woke up startled and hit my head pretty hard trying to get up. The cell phone was emitting the most awful ringing noise I have ever heard. I answered it and the sergeant over the case told me that they had tracked down a man matching the description I gave at the location I had given them. It seemed almost too good to be true. They had brought him in for questioning, they said, and searched his apartment.\n\nMy heart was pounding. I felt like I was going to throw up. But what he said next just made me go completely numb.\n\n\"Based on the conversations we had with this man and our initial assessment of the information you gave us, it does not appear that there is a strong case going forward. We will still submit a report, but honestly, we cannot take him into custody and I doubt that charges will be pursued.\"\n\nI don't know what he said or did that made them go from being ready to get the bad guy to basically dropping the whole thing. Once I was over the initial shock, I tried to get more information. What had changed in those five hours? I tried involving my victim's advocate. While initially supportive of me, she didn't make any progress and now takes several days to return any calls. I got a local legal clinic to look into it and they came back saying that while it seemed strange, they couldn't find any signs that the police were in the wrong.\n\nThat's where it's at now. I've been moving around as much as I can in order to keep this guy from finding me again. Turning him in was a risky move and since he is still free, I'm worried about revenge. I am not planning on updating this story any more and am about to move again.\n\nIn summary, this is my best guess about what's going on:\n\nEither the U.S. government or a medical organization was working on brain implant technology. Someone with access to that research \u2013 probably even someone on the team \u2013\u00a0took that information and reworked the technology on his own time. The result was a microchip that, when properly stimulated, would store the memory of what just happened on the chip instead of in the mind.\n\nA (probably) small network of people had access to these chips and they primarily used them to hide acts of abuse. \n\nEventually, the chips malfunctioned and the memories that had been redirected to the chip now replayed with alarming regularity. The chips are placed in the brain in such a way that removing them surgically is highly dangerous. We have yet to test any other way of disabling them, as it seems to be high risk.\n\nSomeone connected to the network found me, held me hostage, raped me and assumed the chip was still working. I personally suspect that he did it outside of consent from the network. But having found that my chip wasn't working properly, it seems like he would have notified the network. That makes me think that others are now looking for me and the group, too. \n\nWhether they're going to kill us, implant an improved chip or do something else, I do not know. Sometimes I feel like the only way to be taken seriously is to off myself so that the police and everyone else know that I no longer have anything to gain. \n\nThey network has probably read this by now. Some of the commenters could even be one of them \u2013\u00a0I don't know. But I'm warning them now:\n\nIf you do anything to me, the information will get out.

Part 6 should be up tonigh.*\n\nOkay, everyone, I know you were hoping for part 6, but you're gonna have to wait a few more hours. I'm really sorry about that. I've been gradually trying to put it together, but I keep having panic attacks and it's just freaking me out to even think about what happened. It's still really recent and I'm still trying to even understand it. I think that ultimately, it's good for me to write it out, but it's really hard.\n\nSo, for now, I'm just checking in to let you know I'm still alive, not captured by the network and going to be answering comments for a bit to get a break of sorts from thinking about the most recent events. Besides, I feel strongly that all of you deserve replies, as you've stuck with me through this. \n\nBut the reason I'm making this post is also to ask for a favor.\n\nIn the comments, it was pointed out that I should get send the information to a few of my fellow Redditors in case something happens. I think that's a good idea. So what I'm asking is for people to volunteer to hold onto a file of information on me alone, as I don't want to infringe on the privacy of my group members. I will set it up with a password, along with instructions on how to obtain the password should I disappear (and how to know if I'm truly gone). \n\nIf you volunteer, you need to agree to not try to open the file unless it's absolutely necessary. You will also need to promise to keep it secret, obviously. Also, I'd recommend not trying to find this group on your own. I don't know how much help law enforcement will be, so I need someone with good judgment. I'll probably pick two or three people. If you're interested, PM me with an email address I can send the file to, as well as why you think you're a good choice. \n\nIn addition, I contacted my group with the suggestion that we should set up a system where if not a single one of us log on to our communication base for a week, all the data we've accumulated should be released to, well, I'm not quite sure what the best option is, but we'll figure it out. This is the sort of thing that every group member would have to agree on, so I don't think that we'll know today or maybe even this week. I'm pretty sure the tech guy is out of town and he's the one who would know how to set it up anyway. We also carefully discuss things to look at all possible options, but the suggestion is out there and I hope it takes.\n\nOne more thing: I mentioned part of this in the comments, but I doubt everyone saw it. If you think that this could have happened to you, too, only consider this as a last resort. Most of the time when we find someone who sounds like they're one of us, it's not the case. Over the last few years, we've only found nine of us \u2013 with two of them being sisters. There is one major symptom that all of us have in common that I have NOT listed so that we can still tell who really is one of us. If you sincerely believe this story fits your reality, please feel free to PM me. Just make sure to include the last symptom. If you're one of us, you'll know what it is. If not, you probably don't have to worry about the network. I do, however, wish you the best in your recovery.\n\nThanks for all the support I've gotten. I'm sorry that some of you are frustrated about slow updates, but I would like to point out that I'm going much faster than most serials I've read on here and it's kind of a necessity based on my situation. I'm trying my best to get through part 6, but it's really, really painful."},"329":{"title":"walls dripping in pure blackness","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/m3s7w\/walls_dripping_in_pure_blackness\/","flair":null,"author":"0obeno0","selftext":"I was lying in a sort of basement underground room, in a random guest house last night, during my traveling around in Europe.

The email goes as follows:\n\n*Hey (Name Disclosed), I am getting a bit weirded out by something I found on a video camera, wanna come over and check it out?

He is my best friend.\n\nHe is quite good with Videos and stuff, (he's been pretty much addicted to youtube since he was about 8,), and he offered the look more closely at the videos and pictures, see if he can find anything, and with that, he left me for a week.\n\nDuring that week, I texted him, I messaged him, I emailed him, nothing, nothing came back.

I was scared. I decided I would stop searching for stuff. Stop right away, as it only made more trouble for the other guy when he went looking for it. So I stopped, I told Alex to stop, he was reluctant, but he agreed and that was it.\n\nUntil Two Weeks Later.\n\nAlex called me out of the blue, he hadn't stopped and started saying that he had told some of his friends about the videos and that he had put them on youtube.\nI had a massive go at him, told him he just needed to tell the police and leave it.

Very dirty, dirty rug at that.\n\nThings have been pretty rough the last 10 years. I think it\u2019s mostly because I\u2019m easy to manipulate. At least that\u2019s what I think my therapist has been implying. \n\nDid your mom tell you you better shop around?Because mine didn\u2019t.\n\nHow rough were things in my marriage you ask? \n\nSo rough that by the end of our second year together Janice was taking multiple prescriptions to control her bipolar, narcissistic thing, anxiety, depression and drinking problem.\n\nGoddamn medicine chest look like Walgreens.\n\nIt was no small victory getting Janice to the psychiatrist.\n\n\u201cAre you saying I\u2019m not drop dead gorgeous and that men aren\u2019t always showing interest?\u201d\n\nIt was like a root canal but once the shrink saw what we were dealing with, out came the script pad. And therapy, lotsa that.\n\nWe had our ups and downs but I guess I never thought I was in Janice\u2019s class. Me and my therapist were addressing that issue for the last eight years but after last night, I just don\u2019t know.\n\nLast night, Janice, who does what she likes to call dating around, which is essentially doing God knows what with whichever of her myriad friends that she\u2019s always collecting like toys in the attic, last night she comes home about 9pm smelling like a distillery and;\n\nA. Kisses me right on the mouth.\n\nB. Puts her hand behind her back and with a mischievous grin says;\n\nC. Pick.\n\nso I pick and she opens her hand with a theatrical flourish and that mischievous evil grin again pops in,  and she says, \u201ctake one.\u201d\n\nJanice had two pills, one blue and one red.\n\nI got the red one. She placed it in my hand.\n\nI asked her what was it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like ecstasy but times 700,000,000.\u201c\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound very good I say.\u201d\n\n\u201cLindsay, this marriage just isn\u2019t working. All I think about is porn and cheating on you any damn time I feel like it with a belly full of vodka at that\n\nBut my girlfriend got a hold of these pills through her new shrink and she said it patched up her and her husband after ferocious domestic abuse and now they\u2019re like two peas in a pot and they don\u2019t even eat therapy anymore.\u201c\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201c\n\nAnd and here\u2019s the rub. Although my mother tried her damnedest to raise a fool she failed. So, that when I was confronted with the pharmaceutical challenge on my 10th wedding anniversary. I knew what to do.\n\n\u201cYou wanna drink,\u201c I asked.\n\n\u201cDo you have mommy issues?\n\nCould be pretty snarky when she wanted to specially when she was sober or just getting her buzz on. Yeah that anti-alcohol medication that shit don\u2019t work\n\nSo while I was fixing drinks, I put the red pill in the cabinet in a napkin, and I took a multivitamin and then I poured two tumblers full of vodka.\n\nI handed her the drink, kissed her hard on the mouth and said bottoms up\n\nJanice took the pill and washed it down with about 2 ounces of vodka without flinching.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s your turn\u201d\n\nI obliged. Janice knotted and drank another 3 ounces of vodka.\n\nI took a small sip for my part. I really much preferred the weed pen, but I never told Janice or my therapist about it because there\u2019s something so odd sometimes and the way my therapist Steve acts when Janice is nearby. I could almost feel they are in cahoots at our couples therapy.\n\nJanice told me to come close she said tonight is the night that is all about new beginnings and the kiss held and it metamorphic into a lot of things and I hadn\u2019t done in years but before it was over, caught up in the rapture, I went to kiss Janice\u2019s neck and that\u2019s when I felt it.\n\nScales I\u2019m talking serpentine scales right under her jaw that weren\u2019t there before we got into bed kissing while she was Trippin and she kept saying \u201cthis is not your father\u2018s Cadillac.\u201d\n\nMy face felt it first but within a few minutes when we were disrobed, that\u2019s when I realized it was almost like the literal autistic translation of death by 1000 paper cuts. All over my body.\n\nAs Janice asserted her dominance, the pain worsened. Now it wasn\u2019t just my face anymore. It\u2019s my arms, my legs, my stomach, my feet. Like being attacked by the sandpaper people.\n\nJanice began hissing and clawing, and the whole thing to send it into the simple fact that her skin was covered in scaly eruptions.

If, on the other hand, you are upset about what I wrote or are interested in the discussion about the appropriateness of the story for this subreddit, feel free to read on.*\n\nTwo days ago, I started posting a serialized story here on r\/nosleep. While it started out being hailed as \"a breath of fresh air\" and \"compelling,\" I have since then been accused of ruining the subreddit, enabling rape and generally being a terrible person. On the other hand, I've had people who have shown me amazing kindness, especially in private messages. The help and information some of you have offered has been overwhelming.\n\nNeedless to say, I think I've inadvertently made myself one of the most controversial authors on r\/nosleep.\n\nLast night I decided to remove myself from the comments and even almost all of the PMs. I was hoping to just finish the story, let the voting system take care of it and move on. But after criticism of my story moved from the comments and started coming into their own, I had a PM talk with one of my biggest critics and came to the conclusion that it would be appropriate for me to address a few things regarding the story and my intent. Also, having been on the receiving end of an unusual amount of debunking and criticism (for r\/nosleep), I'm throwing in my two cents on that as well.\n\n**How I started writing this story**\n\nA few days ago, after seeing a movie with a lot of potential that ended up being about aliens (again), I got caught up in a conversation about what is actually \"scary.\" I was of the opinion that monsters, aliens, ghosts, etc. have become somewhat of a crutch in terms of scary stories. My discussion partner, however, had the attitude of, \"Well, what else could we do?\" I defended the position that reality is the scariest thing out there, especially the things that people do to each other. I was challenged to prove my point and the next day, I posted the first part of the story. (Making a movie was clearly too time consuming and expensive.)\n\n**Concerning whether or not it is true**\n\nIn order to complete my goal, I went straight to what scares me the most in real life. I am perfectly fine with whether or not people believe that microchips planted by a secret network is to blame for my symptoms. What I want to make 100 percent clear is that outside of the \"Is it true or not?\" discussion, a few things need to be accepted as fact.\n\nBetween the ages of 4 and 11, I was repeatedly sexually abused by my mom's friend's husband. \n\nLast month, I was stuck in a basement apartment with an older man who raped me.\n\nWhen I tried telling the police about the rape, they were initially super supportive and actually said they were planning on arresting him. This was, in part, due to a recorded verbal confession of rape from this man. Despite this, my case apparently doesn't \"hold up\" and I am stuck in a very confusing place from both a legal and emotional place. \n\nBattle out the conspiracy theories all you want, but I will stand by these three things no matter what. \n\n**About sexual abuse and rape**\n\nSome people complained that my use of rape in the plot was distasteful. This mostly seemed to be people who were adamant about my story not being true. \n\nI would like to point out that whether or not you believe in the story as a whole, part of my intent in writing the story was to convey three things: the sheer terror of having to relive the worst moments of your life repeatedly and realistically; the constant fear of never being safe and having this proven true again and again; and, finally, the despair of being stuck in a reality where those who are supposed to protect you fail to do so and even make it worse.\n\nAside from the truthfulness of the narrative, those are things that I have to feel on a daily basis. I wanted to show that these things are, at least to me, far more terrifying than anything I have ever seen in a scary movie (and I have seen very many). \n\nNext time you are sitting in a classroom, movie theatre or religious service, count off every third female and every fifth male. Statistically, those people were or will be sexually abused or assaulted by age 18. It's very sobering to think about how prevalent of a problem this is. Sometimes, the result of this abuse is more severe than others. In cases like mine, it's sometimes debilitating \u2013 whether as a result of a microchip or post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nI hope you can understand that in this story, it was not simply a \"plot tool.\" I was trying to convey the lasting terror that those things can cause. In my experience, it's one of the scariest things out there.\n\n**Was this the right subreddit for this story?**\n\nHonestly? I don't know for sure. With the byline of \"A subreddit where fear itself dwells,\" it seemed appropriate. If the mission is to tell stories that impose fear in an atmosphere where everything is real (even when it's not), it seems like a fair submission. If anyone looking for strictly paranormal stories, the title of my posts should have been fair warning. I was inclined to post here for a reason and I still think I was within the current guidelines. If the readers of this subreddit decide that they want to eliminate stories that do not have a paranormal aspect, it's something that should be taken up with the mods.\n\n**My thoughts on the civility in discussion**\n\nI see two of the major draws of r\/nosleep as being that everything is true and that debunking is strongly discouraged. My story attracted a lot of attention and as the plot thickened, those two aspects basically fell apart. Instead of opinions on the story itself, questions about what was going on, contributions of relevant information or other generally appropriate feedback, it all fell apart. \n\nWhat started as criticisms of my choice to post in parts turned into critiques of the way I was writing, along with people trying to prove that what I was saying was either implausible or simply untrue. This really broke the mood that r\/nosleep is known for and while I tried to offer explanations at first, it just stopped being worth it. \n\nBy the time part 6 was up, the personal attacks were getting more and more severe. People were making assumptions about where the story was going and bashing me based on those, going so far as to accuse me and other rape victims of being rape enablers. Personally, I think victim blaming is rarely (if ever) an appropriate thing to do, as it creates an environment that allows for continued violence. Part of the reason why victims don't always speak up is due to these types of responses. Only when people stop assuming they know everything and give crime victims the same benefit of the doubt that criminals are legally afforded can we even begin to address the personal and societal pestilence that sexual assault is.\n\nI think that this story and the ensuing discussion serve as a reflection of what r\/nosleep is potentially becoming. There's still time to stop it. Is this really what you want the community to be like? The whole reason I love Reddit is because you can upvote and downvote. Nosleep is unique because it relies on that system more than other subreddits, as they discourage questioning the author. Do you, as a community, want to keep this environment intact? If so, I suggest that you take a long hard look at what just happened.\n\nI know not everyone likes every story. That's okay. Just remember that Reddit isn't 4chan and r\/nosleep isn't Reddit. We have a very special community \u2013 let's keep it that way.

What people can feel, see, touch, hear, and smell is painfully limited, so 90% of the Earth's natural actions will never come to our attention. An example of our body's ignorance is the electromagnetic spectrum (both visible and invisible light), which anyone with even a brief history of science knows humans are mostly blind to. In short, there are constantly invisible events and beings around us that we will never know about. \n\nIncluded in these invisible beings are insects known as \"Spider T974s\" because they haven't been truly named by science. These spiders are barely poisonous, and only have venom strong enough to get you mildly sick. Ever heard of rhinovirus? *The common cold?* Sure you have, but most people sick with rhino virus have never even been near a rhino...\n\nSuch a funny coincidence... Spider T974s are supposed to look like horned black-widows, giving them a *rhino* appearance; it's only appropriate if I refer to the spiders as, \"Rhino Spiders,\" for the rest of this post. \n\nYou must be asking yourself, \"Well, why can't I see them?\" As stated earlier, a rhino spider exoskeleton mixes with light so precisely that the light's sensitivity is changed, pushing it out of the visible spectrum. Rhino spiders are very sensitive and try to move away from even the smallest change in the environment. \n\nLet's say, you're looking at a picture of a spider, and your hair *just barely* stands up. To the rhino spiders, that small change is quite startling, and sends them running down your arms or legs. There's nothing you can do about, because as recently discovered, there are A LOT of them. \n\nNatural predators can't see them either, so their numbers grow and grow and grow until every where you go is covered with them. I don't mean to frighten you, but chances are that your home, cars, and workplaces have rhino spider infestations.\n\nMaybe more difficult to come to terms with is their size. Sure, most of them are relatively small, but failure of crowd control by nature's natural hunters has caused some rhino spiders to grow incredibly big; some are believed to be as large as small children. \n\nThink about it, have you ever laid in your bed at night and heard scratches from outside? *\"Oh, it's just the trees...\"* The trees are always scratching against your house, but somehow *that's* the only time you hear it? What if the strong winds are startling the massive rhino-spiders outside, and they're moving around to become more comfortable in the storm. \n\nThese aren't pretty images, are they?\n\nIf you have a fear of spiders, you're only hope is to get over it VERY quickly, because the truth isn't going anywhere. Go ahead, wash your hands and brush you arms to try and get them off; it's not working is it? They'll always be with you, watching you, *on you* just waiting to give you the next bite.

It is aimed at YOU. You know who you are, and I wish for you that every thing your loathsome selves enjoy be done upon your person a thousand times over!\n\nWith that out of the way, allow me to commence.\n\nGreetings, ladies and gentlemen. As you can see, my name is Daniel, I'll withhold my surnames, as I would like to retain a sliver of that illusion called \"privacy.\" I am writing this under a crushing amount of psychological stress, and enjoying the placid stupor of my prescription drug -an anxiolytic, to regulate high levels of anxiety,- yet I assure you, I am as lucid as I have ever and will ever be. I wish I could forget what I am about to narrate, yet there's no nepenthe that could erase the things I have seen, what I know. I shall relate my experiences as a naive explorer of the \"Deep Web\" to the best of my ability.\n\nTo commence, I would like to give you insight as to what is this \"Deep Web.\" Imagine an iceberg, the most massive pile of buoyant ice you can conjure. That is the Internet. As you know by the ages old adage, the tip of the iceberg is the portion we can easily see; in this context, the \"Upper Web\" is what we can see on our daily lives: Google, Facebook, YouTube, YouPorn, this very Reddit we are on right now. As Mufasa would put it, \"Everything the light touches,\" our kingdom of information and socialization. \"But what about that shadowy place?\" asks a young Simba. The bottom of the iceberg, that which remains unseen is the \"Deep Web,\" and in a manner akin to an actual iceberg, it comprises up to an esteemed 96% of the whole expanse of the Internet. This Deep Web contains the websites not indexed by search engines such as Google or Yahoo, not even Bing, and as such, they remain hidden beneath the \"water.\" And just as Mufasa replied, \"That is beyond our borders, you must never go there.\" And what did Simba do? The very same stupid, foolish, unforgivable thing I did. He disregarded the warnings.\n\nI heard about the Deep Web from an acquaintance of mine, a fellow who studies computer engineering and, as such, has contact with codes and networks and other such amenities. At first I disregarded his claims about the existence of this Deep Web, and how could I not? 'Impossible,' methought, 'that such a vast repository of information and interaction could lie hidden beneath our noses. Ludicrous!' -And, for the record yes, this is the way I think and speak in English, as it is not my mother language. They know, and so do you have the right to know- At the time it appeared to me as a thing of legend, a vast reservoir of knowledge and arcane lore the likes of which could be found in lost Alexandria, or the ransacked libraries of Baghdad. The mere idea that such an inconceivable ocean of data -an esteemed 8 flaming petabytes! existed in our world seemed beyond fantastic. Like a fool I was seduced by the idea of seeing this occult side of the Internet.\n\nSwayed and tutored by my acquaintance in the ways to access the Deep Web, -ways that for your safety I shall not, and I repeat, shall NOT describe, so please don't inquire about them- feeling safe and sound within the sanctum of my living quarters, I clicked on the executable program that would link me with this gallery of knowledge. Admittedly, at the time I felt like the One after having chosen the red pill, about to embark in a journey through untrodden pathways of information; I felt akin to an explorer akin to Columbus, a scientist on par with Darwin as he voyaged across the Galapagos islands in the search for wisdom. Perhaps if my mind had been made of sterner stuff I could have withstood what I came to learn.\n\nAnd so I entered into the realm beyond the light. \n\nAt first it was a grossly underwhelming, anticlimactic sight to behold. \"The fuck is this?\" I intoned, as I was greeted by a blank page stating I had entered correctly. Was this the oh so famous \"deep web?\" A blank page with less flair than the 90's gif-fests of yore? I found myself feeling an abject disappointment; my thoughts of unknown secrets, adventure, and discovery had toppled to the ground. Now I wish I had left them there, never to be picked up. \n\nMy acquaintance sent me a link, eloquently titled the \"hidden wiki.\" Within, I found a list of links categorized in a wide arrange of topics: You could find links to purchase weapons and drugs in the black market, to arrange shady meetings, and of course, porn -much like life in the universe, in the Internet, porn always finds a way.- Suffice to say my appetite had been whetted, and I hungered, lusted, for more. \n\nAnd here is where I must needs take a break, another dose of alprazolam as this one has worn out. Let me tell you my diagnosis, so you can better understand my... condition, and to calm myself down a trifle; if you feel like it feel free to skip the following couple paragraphs entirely as they pertain to my personality and not to the story itself.\n\nAfter being entered in my local psychiatric hospital, which I'm afraid is nothing like what you see in movies, and being medicated, I was diagnosed with \"Unspecified Anxiety Disorder,\" 300.00 as cataloged on the DSM-V and F41.9 on the CIE-10 manual, and \"Paranoid Personality Disorder,\" 301.0 (F60.0) What this signifies is that I suffer from crippling anxiety attacks on a near-daily basis; I commence sweating profusely, breathe heavily, and more often than not I'm prone to attacking other people, hence part of the \"justification\" for a paranoid personality diagnosis. The idiots; what they did was, in truth, say that they knew I was anxious but possessed no idea as to what was the cause. That's what happens when every flaming psychiatrist suffers from an acute case of fecal encephalopathy. So, they medicated me, with the medicine that grants them a share of course, and called it a day. Of course they also hinted to my parents that I \"may\" be a risk for developing paranoid schizophrenia, since I'm within the age range. Twenty years as of the time of this writing, twenty one in a few weeks; they know and so you have right to know.\n\nIn truth, I do not have much to complain about regarding my medication, as it has proven to be respite. Respite and nepenthe from the memory of the lore. I quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this forbidden lore! Quoth the raven, 'Nevermore.' \n\nAmusing how anxiety enhances your metabolism, makes things seemingly act quicker, but wear out faster. At least I need not worry about being obese. \n\nBut back to the story.\n\nAs I was relating, I ventured forth into the Deep Web in the search for hidden gems of knowledge. And I did learn a lot: There's a huge, expansive black market for weapons, drugs, explosives and any illegal thing you may imagine; exotic creatures abound and are sold at quite reasonable prices -if you consider $10,000.99 reasonable for a Siberian tiger that is;- counterfeit money was sold on a rate of 2:1, and PayPal accounts containing up to $100,000.00 sold for a fraction of their purported value. It appeared to me as a veritable \"Rosebud\" cheat, only in real life. 'Fantastic!' methought, \"ALLONS-Y!\" quoth I.\n\nOf course, inquisition and discovery, a lapse is necessary. And what better way to regain energy and confidence, than to ogle some fine pornography? What can I say, I am but a man. Intrigued by the... possibilities of what I could find, I ventured into the \"Erotica\" section of the hidden wiki. What first stood out to me was a link titled \"Pink Meth,\" a quaint name, but seemingly fitting for the purpose, thought I. At first sight it seemed to be your standard porn site, pictures of girls neatly arranged in rows, without a specific order to them; some of then scantly clad, others perfectly naked. Nothing unusual up to this point, merely another page that offered \"amateur porn.\" But then I noticed a curious link beneath each picture, the name of the lady in question and, attached to it, a FaceBook profile. \"The hell!?\" exclaimed I as the blue letters took me to a FaceBook page; her name, address, friends, family, IP, everything had been laid out before me. \n\nThis admittedly distressed me. The information I had access to could positively ruin a young lady's life. Not only that, it could be used for... other purposes. Suddenly the jokes about how \"stalking is much easier thanks to FaceBook\" took a much sinister meaning. In fairness, she should not have published those pictures of herself on the internet; countering that argument however, maybe she did not, perhaps it was a spiteful boyfriend or someone hacked her PC or something of such nature. I knew not, and it was not something I wished to know the reason for.\n\nI left the site feeling a trifle shaken. \"Poor girl\" said I, and I meant it: No one should be subject to that, let alone that exposed in her personal information. I know that subreddits such as \/gonewild or \/grool serve the purpose of exposing oneself, \"going wild.\" Still, it is one thing to do it willingly and deciding what information to share into the world, and a very different situation altogether to have your identity hung out before the eyes of anyone with enough time and know-how to find it.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nAnd a good thing that I do, at that. As I write this, I realize I have nearly reached the maximum amount of allowed characters; in a way I apologize, but it is necessary, for I wish to leave no detail behind. I shall continue with the narrative in the comments section below. I do not wish to cease narrating now, as I don't know if I'll have the guts, or the soundness of mind, to keep going tomorrow in a \"part 2.\"\n\nBut I warn you: From this point on, things may become... terrible.

I didn't know where I was going, but I knew I had to get away.  \n  \nBehind me, I could hear the sound of footsteps. The dopplegangers were still after me.  \n  \nI ran faster, my lungs burning. I couldn't let them catch me. I had to survive.  \nIn the suffocating darkness of my room, I huddled beneath the bed, my heart pounding like a drum against my ribs. The air was thick with the stench of decay and fear, a testament to the horrors that had unfolded within these walls.  \n  \nMy mother's diary lay open on the floor, its pages stained with blood and tears. I had been reading it, desperate for any shred of solace or understanding, but it only served to fuel my terror. Her entries were a chilling chronicle of her descent into madness, as she became convinced that her own reflection was trying to kill her.  \n  \n'They're not me,' she had written in a trembling hand. 'They're monsters, wearing my face.'  \n  \nI had dismissed her words as the ramblings of a frightened woman, but now I knew the truth. The dopplegangers were real, and they had killed her.  \n  \nI had been hiding from them for hours, ever since I heard their footsteps echoing through the house. They were relentless, their movements fluid and predatory. I could hear them searching for me, their voices a chorus of mocking whispers.  \n  \n'Where are you, little boy?'  \n  \n'Come out, come out, wherever you are.'  \n  \nI pressed myself against the cold, damp floor, willing myself to become invisible. But they were too close, their heavy breathing just outside the door.  \n  \nSuddenly, the door creaked open, and a pair of eyes peered into the room. They were my own eyes, but they were cold and lifeless, filled with a malevolence that chilled me to the bone.  \n  \n'I found you,' the doppelganger hissed.  \n  \nI scrambled to my feet, but it was too late. The doppelganger lunged, its sharp claws extended. I dodged its attack, but it was relentless, its movements faster and more precise than my own.  \n  \nWe grappled on the floor, a blur of limbs and shadows. I fought back with all my might, but it was no use. The doppelganger was stronger, its grip like a vise.  \n  \nJust when I thought all hope was lost, I remembered the diary. I grabbed it and hurled it at the doppelganger. It hit it square in the face, and for a moment, it staggered.  \n  \nI seized the opportunity and kicked it away, sending it crashing into the wall. It lay there motionless, its eyes glazed and empty.  \n  \nI had defeated one of them, but I knew there were more. I had to find a way to escape.  \n  \nI searched the room frantically, my eyes darting from one object to the next. Finally, I spotted a small window in the corner. It was boarded up, but I could see a crack in the wood.  \n  \nWith trembling hands, I pried the boards loose and squeezed through the narrow opening. I landed on the ground with a thud, but I didn't stop running.  \n  \nI ran throug  \nFinally, I reached a road and flagged down a passing car. The driver was a kind old man who took me to the police station.  \n  \nI told them everything that had happened, but they didn't believe me. They thought I was just a scared kid who had made up a story.  \n  \nBut I knew the truth.

So, when I noticed a new app, named \"Twelve\" on my phone one dreary morning, my initial thought was a forgotten download from a sleep-deprived night. The app's icon was unassuming: a black clock, its hands eternally pointing to midnight.\n\nTapping it out of sheer curiosity, I was met with an abyss of blackness. A single, chilling line of text surfaced: *\"You are now bound. Await the twelfth hour.\"* I tried laughing it off, dismissing it as a silly game or perhaps the result of a friend's prank. But the app defied deletion, resisting all attempts.\n\nThe true oddity began that night. At the stroke of midnight, my phone vibrated with an intensity I'd never felt before. The app had a message for me: *\"Look behind you.\"* Hesitantly, I did, and my TV\u2014previously off\u2014sprang to life. It played grainy, distorted images: my childhood home, my first school, places I hadn\u2019t thought about in years.\n\nEvery subsequent night brought a new instruction. Some were innocuous, like *\"Whisper your favorite memory.\"* Others were unsettling: *\"Sing your deepest secret out loud.\"* When I refused, every device in my home blared my confessions on repeat until, in sheer desperation, I relented.\n\nAs days turned into nights and nights back into days, a pattern emerged. With every passing command, the tasks grew more menacing. \n\n*\"Place a candle by your window and do not sleep.\"* Doing as instructed, I spent the night watching figures cloaked in darkness gather outside my window. They never entered, never moved closer. They just stood, their attention unwaveringly fixed on the candle's flame.\n\nHowever, one message made my blood run cold: *\"Do not turn around, no matter what you hear.\"* The night that followed was torturous. Soft, mournful whispers encircled me, voices from my past urging, pleading, demanding that I look. But fear kept me anchored, my gaze forward.\n\nThe climax of my torment was a message I hadn\u2019t expected: *\"Say goodbye.\"* Panic took over. I barricaded myself in my bedroom. The night was an endless cacophony of knocks and voices. Each voice was unmistakably familiar: my long-deceased grandmother, a childhood friend I hadn't spoken to in decades, even my mother from just across the hall. They beckoned, cajoled, and sometimes angrily demanded I open the door. But dawn came, and the noise ceased.\n\nThe next morning, as I looked at my reflection, a horrifying realization dawned. I was younger. Not by a lot, but noticeably. The app's once static clock icon now moved, but counter-clockwise. As days turned into nights, my reflection revealed a steadily regressing version of me. My recent memories began to fade, replaced by recollections of my younger years.\n\nNow, the app's twisted commands dictate my life. They bind me to a cycle of terror, anticipation, and relentless regression. Desperate to break free, I've sought help, but to no avail. Everyone perceives me as the age I appear, with no recollection of the years I've lived.\n\nWith every midnight that the clock approaches, I inch closer to my birth. And as I pen this, I can't help but wonder: when the clock reaches the moment of my birth, will I simply cease to exist or will I be trapped in a loop of horrors I've already endured?"},"343":{"title":"2:47","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/2ib2dv\/247\/","flair":null,"author":"None","selftext":"It was a dark warm night in Wyoming, my wife Lauren was asleep, and I had tucked my two children Carly and Stan into bed.  I was sitting in the living room watching tv with a glass full of rum.  It was a re-run of Two and A Half men that seems to be the only episode they are playing every time I turn on the tv.  I was sipping away at my glass when I heard a weird noise outside, sounded like a metal crowbar falling to the ground.\n \n\n I got up to make sure no one was breaking into any vehicles.  It was dark out side so I flipped on my porch light.  I still couldent see anything so i reached into my pocket for my lighter.  As I walked down my driveway which was empty because my car was in my garage, I looked at my neighbors car and it looked like a note was on the front windshield. I picked it up and read it.\n\n\n  \u201cI will be watching you david\u201d shocked me that my own name was on this note.  I walked over to my neighbors door.

I parked my car in a no parking spot again!\u201d confused I asked him what that had to do with the note and he showed me that it was just a parking ticket.  Confused what just happened I apologized for the inconvenience and headed back inside.\n\n\n  I sat back down with my rum.  I thought to myself I have had to much to drink. I went to turn the tv off and proceeded to pour my rum out and hop in bed.  I woke up and walked down the stairs and found the tv was still on and my glass of rum still sitting on the coffee table. \n\n I looked outside and it was still dark outside, I pulled out my phone and checked the time and it was still 2:37 in the morning.  That\u2019s when I heard a knock on the door.  I walked over to it and opened it.

As they lifted me up off the ground I looked at my shirt and there was blood everywhere.  The officer told me I was under arrest for the murder of Dan my neighbor and read me my rights before hauling me off to their police car.\n  I sat there and watched as the police stood there talking to my wife, I looked over and Dans house and it was covered in crime scene tape and police everywhere.

I asked the guard if I could have my phone call so I could call my wife, he proceeded to tell me I could not.\n\n\n  I turned around and there were three other men in the cell with me, one of them walked over I closed my eyes scared of what was about to happen when all of a sudden my hair was pulled back hard and I opened my eyes.  I  looked up and saw my daughter carly.  She said she was thirsty and I was screaming in my sleep.  Extremely confused I looked at my phone and it was 2:37.  I was hyperventilating at this point but got up to get her some water. \n\n\nI took her back upstairs and tucked her in bed and went back down stairs.  I flopped on the couch thinking about the weird dream I had just had.  i proceeded to reach for the romote and change the channel to adult swim and fell asleep I woke up to my wife curling up next to me on the couch saying she missed me in bed that night I chuckled a sigh of relief when I noticed I had drank the entire bottle of rum, realizing that the was the cause of my terrible nightmares.  My wife reached over to change the channel to the morning news. \n\n\n The headline of the morning story stated Dan Kelper had been murdered last night with a crowbar in his home, Dans wife found him beaten to death and called the police. My heart was racing at this point and I jumped up to look outside and there were poilice surrounding his home I couldent believe what was happening.  I looked back and my wife was gone I ran upstairs and she was gone and so were our kids.  I saw a note sitting on my daughters bed, I walked over and picked it up and it read \u201c2:37\u201d  I turned around and my wife was standing there. \n\n\n I asked her where the kids were and she said they have been at her moms house for the past 4 days I looked back at the note and flipped it over,  and there was fingerprints of blood on the back I showed my wife and explained what I dreamt of last night, she looked at me very uncomfortably and said david your scaring me, its 2:37 in the morning right now.\n"},"344":{"title":"Why the cruelty of others is far more scary than the paranormal.

For instance, after a terrible car crash, you could take a pill and not have to remember it. They're even trying to make stuff to target specific memories that may have happened a long time ago. There is some debate about the ethics of this, but what those scientists may not realize is that there's already data. \n\nYou see, the ability to do what they are attempting has been around for at least twenty years or so. (Prototypes and testing may have been in the works for longer, but I don't know much about those.) It just hasn't been in the form of a pill. I know half of you will stop reading after I say this, but I'm serious: Microchips.\n\n\"Really?,\" you're thinking. \"Microchips that alter memories have been around for twenty years?\" Sounds crazy, but remember, we'd managed to travel into space decades earlier. Also, I'm sure the public is unaware of lots of technology that's out there. I'm sorry I don't know much about the origins of this in particular \u2013 it's kind of hard to track, for so many reasons. But I will tell you what I know.\n\nYou see, when that girl went to have her head scanned, they did an X-ray. There was something small tangled into her brain. Her technician friend really thought she should see a specialist, but the girl said no. The technician couldn't tell anyone anyway, as he'd used work resources after hours, plus he didn't know her well enough to risk his job.\n\nThe reason she didn't want to see a doctor was because, like most of our group, she had come to mistrust and even hate medical and mental health professionals. If we go in to someone and explain our symptoms, then we're told they're a result of a traumatic childhood and that we should work on it in therapy. If we take it a step further and mention that we think there's something inside of us causing the symptoms, we are now psychotic and should take heavy meeds. \n\nSo how did we get to the conclusion that what was in her head was a microchip? Well, it's a whole long story and I respect the group enough not to divulge too much, as it could endanger others. But basically, the tech guy took a picture the girl's X-ray to a friend who was studying to be a surgeon, who found it sufficiently weird to where she then took it to a brain surgeon she knew. In short, it appeared to be something metallic that was positioned in a way that made operating to have it removed extremely high risk. The surgeon said that unless it was causing extraordinary problems for whoever had it, he would refuse to even try to get it out.\n\nAt this point, the two original members of the group found a third person with the same symptoms and they set up the communication network we use today. As they were trying to figure out what was going on, they came across [this group](http:\/\/www.freedomfchs.com\/). Basically, they're a bunch of people that believe they have been implanted with chips that are used for surveillance and torture. I'm not going to say whether or not they're right, as I have no way of knowing that. Their stories don't exactly fit our group's symptoms, but the it set off the chain of thoughts that, in the end, led to the following theory:\n\nA highly selective network of people exists in the U.S. We don't know how big or small it is, but suspect that it isn't huge. In the early nineties, they started using a new experimental technology that possibly was an offshoot of something a network member (or members) was working on for either the government or a medical organization. They made these microchips that they would insert into the brains of children. (While two of the earliest ones we've found are in slightly varying locations on the heads, all the rest have been in approximately the same location.) \n\nWhen these chips were in place, some other technology (we haven't figured it out yet) get used to activate the chip, which then seems to redirect the brain's processing to store the memory of whatever just happened on the chip instead of in the brain. While most of us suffered severe repeated child abuse (mostly sexual), there is one person in the group who witnessed a murder. There's one other situation, too, but it's too unique to discuss here, as it might help identify the person.\n\nThe theory is that starting in the mid-2000s, the chips started failing. Whatever thought process that was supposed to lead to those memories had been getting blocked by the chip, but they started malfunctioning and instead of hiding the memories, they were released. It's like they're on a loop and demanding a ton of attention. This is what makes us feel like it's all happening again. \n\nIt might seem a bit much to think that we all have these chips because one girl had a weird X-ray, but we can't all get them. Not only are we afraid of being labeled as crazy and given inappropriate treatment (one person in the group was hospitalized on a psych ward for five months), but even if those risks weren't there, it's hard to get anyone to give us an X-ray simply because we suspect something has been implanted in our heads. One other group member got an X-ray for something else, and a similar irregularity to the first girl showed up. It's probably a good thing that her doctor was somewhat incompetent and didn't really press the issue, focusing instead on what she had originally needed the X-ray for.\n\nAs for why we have two cases outside of the U.S., we can trace both of those to America. In my case, his wife was American and they had lived in the U.S. for a little while shortly before everything that happened to me. They also regularly vacationed there. She happens to be from an area that seems to have a cluster of cases \u2013 not that we have that much data, but three of our nine cases were within a 200 mile radius of each other. That's not counting my case, which happened in another country, but probably originated in that area.\n\nI know this seems to be a lot of speculation, but I can't really share all of our evidence, as that might identify other people in our group. But the theory seems pretty solid to us, based on the information we have gathered.\n\nI wish this was where it ended: We're working on figuring it out and maybe someday the chips will stop working altogether or we'll get them removed or something. Maybe we could get this network arrested. But it gets even worse.\n\nI hate to leave you with an unfinished story yet again, but someone from the network found me earlier this month. Because what happened was so traumatic and happened so recently, I really don't feel like I can write up what happened right now. It's too exhausting. I'll get to it later today, I promise, unless I get taken again. I think I'm safe for now, though. I've been in hiding the whole time I've been writing this story, but I'm moving to a new location after posting this and answering your comments. Having said what I just did, there is a chance they'll find this post because I think they have something set up on the Internet to track certain keywords and phrases. \n\nIt might seem foolish for me to post this if this is the case, but if anything happens to me, my group is (rightly) too concerned for their own safety to risk helping me. That's why I am putting this out there. The group needs to protect itself, but someone needs to hold these guys accountable. I'll keep trying to work on it, but they already found me once and I bet they can find me again.\n\nI know most of you who did take me seriously probably just stopped believing because of the claims made in this post. I understand \u2013 I probably would dismiss it, too, if it wasn't my own experience. But if you believe me and I don't post again later today, something bad happened. I don't want to endanger the group or those close to me. My life isn't worth enough to do that. But I want to leave this story as evidence that there is a sinister network out there, that I was targeted and that they still are around and trying to track us down.\n\nHopefully I'll be able to tell you more about that this evening."},"345":{"title":"My foster sister who lived with me for about a year.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/k216z\/my_foster_sister_who_lived_with_me_for_about_a\/","flair":null,"author":"UNDEADxxBUBBLEZ","selftext":"Okay.

The reason her boyfriend pressed charges is because SHE claims that HE bit her and busted out her back windshield. But according to her boyfriend SHE bit herself and had someone bust her windshield out for her to blame it on him. We thought that was a load of shit till we noticed the bite mark. It looked as if SHE did it.\n\n\n There is a different pattern that would have been if someone else bit her then compared to her biting herself. so when she was arrested we started cleaning up her room and this is when shit got creepy.

Seriously, if you had a police line-up, but could only see from the knees down, you\u2019d pick my calves and feet as the cutest every time.\n\nIt\u2019s a gift and a curse.\n\nCan\u2019t get a girlfriend, but my lower fourth can get any guy I want.\n\nBoo-hoo, right?\n\n*Right.*\n\nAnyways, Simon brought the kitten over along with his gear. He\u2019s thinks she\u2019s got potential. *Star* quality.\n\nWhatever.\n\nHe thought the kitten that he brought last month had star quality too. Her name was Firefly. She had a brown coat and blue eyes. *Cute.*\n\nAs usual, once Simon got the camera rolling, I strapped on my stilettos and played with Firefly. I made her run this way and that with this little wand I have that has bright feathers on the end. She would pounce for the feathers every time. \n\nThen Simon turned on the music. Same song every month. \n\nWhen Simon hits play, that means it\u2019s showtime. \n\nI dropped the wand and walked over to Firefly.

She was a cutie.\n\nI slowly shifted my weight to the stiletto that had Firefly pinned to the tile. She quit suckling the toe of my stiletto and instead started hissing, trying to get out from under foot. I smiled down and shushed her as I put more and more weight on her little body.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if the point of the stiletto slipped into her belly first, or if the first pop of a rib sounded in the room. Maybe both happened at the same time. Either way, Firefly started panicking.\n\nIt was fucking *adorable.*\n\nShe almost got out from under my foot so I had to press down with all my weight. Her chest collapsed in a medley of wet crunches and snaps. Firefly screamed as the point of my stiletto clicked against the tile. \n\nCan you imagine how stepping on a frozen, empty bird\u2019s nest feels?\n\nNow you know what crushing a kitten feels like.\n\nA pool of blood\u2014it\u2019s always darker than you expect\u2014formed beneath Firefly's hips. Small trickles leaked from both corners of her open mouth. She seemed to be having trouble breathing.\n\nI waited until I saw the life leave her eyes before I lifted my foot and kicked her off. Her flattened body slid across the tile towards the camera.\n\nSimon paid me and I headed home.\n\nThe kitten purring at my ankles right now is named Christmas. At least that\u2019s what Simon said her name was. He probably named her that in the spirit of the holiday.\n\n*Christmas.*\n\nSimon\u2019s a sick fuck.\n\nAnyways, y\u2019all have a nice night.

Me (24 M) and my wife (25 W) recently bought a house from an elderly women but while we were chatting she told us something odd, \"Never open the door at 3:57 AM.\" Me and my wife did an awkward laugh but she looked dead serious.\n\n Fast forward a few years and it's my wife's 27th birthday. We invited a few friends over the night before and planned to celebrate at midnight. It's around 3:20 AM and we want to order a pizza. We are playing some board games and drinking when we hear the doorbell ring. My wife's best friend gets up to answer it and I tap ce over at the clock, 3:57 AM. I had a bad feeling in my gut but shook it off. I heard the sound of the door opening followed by a scream, a crack, and a thud. Everyone stops and rush over and what I see will haunt me forever. She was dead, her body bent in ways it should never be, blood dripping from her mouth, and she was pale almost paper white. My wife is on the floor crying at this point and while I comfort her I remember we have a ring camera! I pull out my phone and look at the app, nothing. No one was there, \"but how no one's there?\" I say to myself. Me and my wife immediately tell everyone to get out and we head back to bed but I can't fall asleep and I'm pretty sure she is awake.\n\n\nIt's the next morning and we don't talk or eat, we just head to work. 3:50 AM I stayed up then heard the stairs creaking. My wife told me she couldn't sleep and came down to check. 3:57 AM. We heard knocks followed by the sound of bones cracking, a chill went down my spine. I mustered up the courage and opened the door, there it was. 6ft tall, pale skin, it was so skinny you could see the outline of its bones, and its eyes were all black. SNAP. My wife is on the floor dead, I shut the door but forget to lock it and I immediately run to the upstairs bathroom and lock the door. \n\nI can hear the knocks and the sound of bones cracking. \u201cCome out to make it easier for both of us!\u201d It said to me in a deep but high pitched voice. More aggressive knocks and bone cracking i\u2019m getting scared. \u201cCome on just come out pleaseee??\u201d It begged me in a child-like voice. \u201cNo.\u201d I responded in a scared voice. \u201cNo,\u201d was all I could say without crying. It laughed or at least I think it did. It sounded like a laugh with a cry and of course more bone cracking. It's almost 5 AM. My phone is about to die and my wife is dead. Please help me get rid of it and get out. There are no windows and I feel trapped.

I looked into the dangers and risks but I figured eh I like to take risks so I clicked from link to link on the hidden wiki, Daniels links, etc. found you know the casual stuff like drugs and weapons. I tried my best to avoid the cp and anything related to that. \n\nI found random sites that were forums about people talking about fantasy and random stories. Then at the end of the day I decided to stop and go to sleep. So then the next day when I got home from school I got this call from a random number and so I answered it anyway in case it\u2019s an important call...and it was silence for about 5 seconds.\n\nI usually hang up the phone at this point but I kept listening and then I heard mumbling\/whispering. I was creeped out and I realized that it could be a possibility that maybe someone on the deep web is watching me... I thought to myself maybe this is a warning... I decided to stop because anyway for now. \n\nLater in few months past and I was wanting to get back on the dark web and see what new sites are up. So then I was searching on the red browsers search engine and found a messed up site like was a social network for psychos and me and my curious self I continued and made an account and I see that the time stamp was from a few weeks ago....thinking to myself wow that\u2019s recent for the deep web... I continue to these posts on this site. \n\nPeople talking about their crave for cp and gore. I was disgusted then I clicked on the images and it was filled with dead bodies and dead children. So got off the dark web for the day. Few weeks later I get curious and go back to the site finding out that now they have a psycho version of YouTube... they don\u2019t have very many videos but it seems to be either porn or gore. \n\nA video that I think was named a mother and a son with 1 baseball bat. I was thinking this is gotta be fake so I opened the video and started watching the video was taken by the mother and the little boy was sitting on a bed with a music box.....the Mom says \u201cyou know what you did was wrong and you need to apologize\u201d. They kid in silence with just the music box playing sits there then gets up with a baseball bat and hit his mother on the head as the mother falls to the ground seeing the moms reaction and bruising then the kid hits her again and again until her face is disfigured. Gosh this was getting a little to far in disturbing... every swing you can hear the kid crying almost like he doesn\u2019t mean to do this to his mother. \n\nThen finally on his last swing her head comes off with blood splattered on a white sheet on the right side off the screen. After seeing this I almost got a panic attack Because that was way too extreme...after that experience I\u2019ve been more cautious on what I look at.

It started about 7pm and the few of us the went the distance didn't get home until after 6am the next day.\nI'm massively wishing I didn't go the distance, I'd much rather been called a pussy and left at 1 or 2am - then I wouldn't be in this fuckin mess.\n\nMy mate who was getting married came down from another state to get hitched, and most of his mates came over too.. so I don't really know his mates too well.. but I know they are in the army and can drink like motherfuckers.\nI'm not in the army, but I can drink all night and still be pretty much with it.\n\nSo back to the bucks.. lets just say our pubcrawl ended up at strip-bar which was fine, except I didn't realise one of the groomsman paid one of the strippers for sexual favours. Now I also didn't realise that this dude had been sneaking in to the pokies at all the pubs we were visiting and playing them between drinks... I also didn't know that he won a whole lot of cash that night. I'm guessing it must have been upwards of $5k.. because he paid a stripper to blow four guys in our bucks party. Now.. I know she didn't blow me.. but she did shove her tits in my face more than a few times throughout the evening.. so I went home smelling of booze and stripper perfume..\nThis is where things get fucked up. I fully got busted for getting a lapdance, because I stank like stripper skank when I got home and I admitted it.\n\nMy GF was pretty mad but after a few days seemed to get over it.. right up until tonight when she got a call by my mate's GF who said that she was told that all of the boys got BJ's at the strip-club.\nTurns out one of these army meat heads got remorse (and hopefully herpes) and spilled the beans to his missus.. but said WE ALL GOT BLOWN to make it seem like it is less of a thing if we all were in on it.. which is total bullshit.\n\nAnyway my GF didn't tell me about the call until after dinner tonight.. and she was all nice to me making me lasagna with wine.. and homemade garlic bread. She told be about the call, and I said it was a total lie, and I did not get a BJ AT ALL.. she just said it doesn't matter and went to bed and that was like 2 hours ago.. and now I'm thinking what the FUCK is going on? I'm totally stressed that she may have put something in my fucking food or something? I'm fucking looking at the knife block and there is a fucking knife missing too... it is fucking freezing outside and I have to work in 5 hours and I haven't slept and I'm in the study with a fucking mirror next to the screen so I can see behind me.\n\n\n***UPDATE***\n\nI managed to get a friend to answer their phone and they are going to drive around to pick me up. I told them to park down the road and leave the boot open, because I'm bringing my full sized gaming machine with me.. and my dog, but my mate doesn't know about the dog yet.\nSigning off so I can shut the machine down and disconnect, I'll leave the screen and shit behind, that stuff is cheap to replace.\nI just need to make this shit happen quietly. I'm scared to take my eyes of this mirror, but I need to get moving, I'm losing my fucking mind here.\nAs soon as I let the dog out of the laundry he is going to go mental and make a racket.. so I'm going to go in to the laundry and close the door behind me and open the back door and leave with the computer and the dog, out the side gate and down the street with no shoes on in the fucking freezing dark.\nI'll post back from my mates granny flat if I make it out of here.\nthanks for listeneng to my crazy situation.  - RJC\n\n***SECOND UPDATE***\n\nSo made it out and I noticed my GF had the light on in the bedroom as I bolted down the street with my dog and PC.\nI got a txt from her while my mate drove me (btw he was pissed that I brought my dog with me). \nThe txt read: \"You're fucked\".. \n\nI txt back \"I DIDN'T GET A FUCKING BJ... WHY HAVE YOU GOT A KNIFE???\"\n\nGF: \"The knife is not for you asshole\"..\n\nI told my mate to stop the car... I showed him the messages and he just said \"What the fuck?\" I told him to drive back and wait in the car while I go and check on her..\n\nSo I go back and the front door was open, the bedroom light was off but I could see a light at the end of the house.. I walked in and I could hear the radio I saw the knife on the floor of the hallway so I picked it up and carried to the kitchen. GF was sitting at the kitchen table.. when I stepped into the light I could see some blood on the blade so I chucked in the sink and ran over to Marlena. She looked like she was half asleep, but she wasn't injured in any way.. I asked her what happened? where'd the blood come from? but her eyes kinda rolled back in her head and she slowly slumped forward as if she was falling asleep.\n\nI called the cops and they asked if I needed an ambo, I said I wasn't sure, but after I described the condition of my GF they said they were dispatching one.\n\nSo the ambos picked up my GF and took her to the emergency, while the cops questioned me for a while before asking me if I would come back to the cop shop. They checked all the rooms in the house to see if there were other people. I asked if I was under arrest, they said no, but they have more questions. They baggied up the knife and I took a ride with them.\nI was at the station for four hours and had to speak to four different people, I think 2 were detectives and the other was a domestic violence officer or detective. \n\nThey said that the knife was at a forensic lab and if the blood came back human, they would detain me while they search for the victim. They also said they had sent 2 officers to the hospital to talk to my GF.\nI explained the WHOLE story to them but they thought it was strange that I left the house in the middle of the night with no shoes on.\n\nAnyway, finally they said that it wasn't blood, they said it was some sort of starch. They gave me some brochures on relationship counselling and mental health, and they let me go.\n\nI tried calling my GF but someone else answered and said she couldn't talk right now. I phoned the hospital to ask about her, but they wouldn't give me any patient details over the phone.\n\nSo I felt pretty shitty when I got home and decided to pack a bag and drive to the hospital to see if I could stay the night in her room.\n\nI rang another one my mates who was at the bucks (not the dude with the car) to tell them what was going on and he was pretty shocked.. apparently one of the guys that got a BJ was getting a separation from his wife.. but because the army boys had gone home we don't really know what happened to them. I told my mate not to tell the groom about what's going on, because I didn't want it to spoil their honeymoon. I said I didn't want the bride to find out about the BJ's at the strip bar, but my mate said that she already knew and he thought everyone knew about the strip bar weeks ago???!!!??Which is fucking weird because NOBODY TALKED ABOUT IT AT THE WEDDING.\n\nI got off the phone pretty confused and drove to the hospital..\nWhen I got there, they said that she had taken quite a few sleeping pills. They said the bloods were ok but she'd be drowsy for quite a while, because they didn't let her sleep for ages. They said they kept her awake for quite some time.\n\nI asked if I could stay and they said no, but I could go in to see her.\nI went in to see her and she opened her eyes when I sat down next to the bed. I didn't say much and neither did she. I said that I could't stay but she grabbed my jacket as I went to stand up and she said \"the stripper is gone\". I sort of stood there thinking what the fuck did she just say? she sat up and pushed the call button. A nurse came in and asked if everything was ok? My GF said she needed help getting up to go to the bathroom with her IV drip.\nI just said.. \"ok bye\" about turned and it's like everything is a blur.

Their numbers had grown without respite for a few years now, due to a lack of adequate gelding. And so the males had consistenty (and vigorously, I might add) inspermated the females, whose orifices would be dripping with cat cum as they jumped on the dinner tables and fish dissectories. \n\nAs it would happen, the main problem with this proliferation of cats turned out to be the death of several Esteemed Members on the stairways that interconnect the dormitories and cafeterias of our Last Stand. When Sigun Lazdil broke his neck on stairway 419B, it was decreed by poem:\n\n> In the hall of Esteemed, shadows grow,\n> Thirteen felines, ordained to bestow.\n> Not a sentence of hate, but necessity's flow.\n> \n> Under the moon, their silhouettes glow,\n> Life to release, for balance we owe.\n> In the dance of the world, such seeds were sow. \n> \n> Do not perceive this act as woe, \n> Each stroke of blade, a mercy to show.\n> For in their end, the beginnings we know. \n\nBy this decree the Esteemed Members of Machinecover knew that we must filet and dissect a full 13 of our ragdolls.\n\nHowever it went horribly wrong.\n\nFirstly, no one amongst the Esteemed Members was assigned to clean up the various cartilage, sinews, bones, furs, lip-tentacles (antennae?), ears, eyelashes, claws, little paws, leg pieces, muscles, cat intestines, and other aspects that remained after the actions were carried out according to the decree.\n\nInstead they were left uncovered, on the floors, in the cabins, upon the dressers, and wherever else Esteemed Members saw fit to leave them after the dismemberment had been done. Yet no Clean-Selves, Collect-Selves, or Recycle-Selves were dispatched accordingly.\n\nAs a result, a great malady descended upon the residents of Machinecover. Something came up from the depths of releality, summoned by the cat cries, and homing in on the various rotting fleshes and flayed carcasses strewn about the interiors of the Esteemed Members. \n\nFirst it was merely a shadow: clinging to the corners and sticking to the sidereal. The corneas of the residents of Machinecover indeed kept catching side-glances and flashes of its abominatory shadoweference, yet it remained undetected by the Esteemed Guard. \n\nHowever next, it became vociferous. The cries of the suffering and dying cats would echo nightly through the cavernous corridors and descending switchbacks of Machinecover. Their horrific meows and murrooowws would ceaselessly interrupt our Sleep-Selves, arresting rest and disturbing dreams. \n\nFinally, it became aggressive and quite physical. \n\nFirst to go was Minkot \"Maze\" Osednish, a purveyor of Phantom of Skulls literature, known for being a little tight with her resources.  It came to her cabin at thrice past nocturne, skimming through the crack beneath her door at the end of the culdesac off Stairway 142C. Her teeth were found and identified by Intercover officers, yet aside from the nerves dangling from their roots, no other trace of Maze ever was found. \n\nNext to go was Zefon Norammafol, an unemployed Engraver. A child delivering his supper discovered his right wrist, perfectly sectioned off like a disc of arm, balanced perfectly upon the doorknob of his commode-chamber. No blood drops, no vomit, and no teeth were found at the scene, just the wrist. \n\nAnd now I hear it at my door. I can see its thirteen legs casting shadows beneath my door-gap. I can hear its razor-sharp mandibles engraving something in my door, a skill it has absorbed from Zefon. I am waiting, in the dark."},"352":{"title":"The year I started believing in a God was the year my parents ripped me out of my childhood home and buried me under a pile of rocks in Moab, Utah.

I expected Lisa to take the lead, like she had been this whole time.  Instead, she seemed to cower to the back of our small group.  I turned to face her and noticed both Yamir and Emma had moved behind me as well.  I was our leader now.  I had made the rocks crumble and the opening appear.  Now, I had to lead us to the exit.  I had to lead us to the end. \n\nI walked through the opening and stopped a few feet in, deciding to give my eyes a moment to adjust to the darkness.   It was no use, I couldn\u2019t see my own hands in front of me and there was a sour taste in my mouth.  It smelled like rotten eggs, like sulfur.  I could feel one of them breathing on my neck, I spun around.  I no longer saw any light from the room that we were in before, \u201cGuys, what do we do now?\u201d\n\nThere was no answer, I could still feel breathing on my neck and reached out to touch a body, \u201cYamir?\u201d  \n\nNo answer, \u201cWho is this?\u201d\n\nI found their hand and squeezed it, nothing.  \nI swung my left arm out and felt another body.  It was unresponsive.  \n\nI stumbled around in the darkness and grasped the three hands belonging to my three friends who wouldn\u2019t move or speak.\n\nIt was a joke, a sick terrible and cruel joke, \u201cGuys!\u201d I shouted, \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny anymore!\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease!\u201d I begged, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cLisa! \u201c I sobbed, \u201cAnswer me!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not sure how long I grasped at the three bodies, shouting, begging, and, sobbing.  At some point the silence won out and I became one of the quiet and motionless bodies.  I wanted to be wherever they were.  I thought about feeling for walls, but I felt safe in the triangle of bodies.  I stood there and the silence ate away at me.  The darkness and the silence worked together until it was drowning me.  I was breathing it in and poisoning my lungs.  It was choking me.  I began howling.\n\nThe awful, sick howling that I\u2019d heard earlier started coming from my own twisted mouth.  My jaw began to ache and I thought violent things.  Like carving out Yamir\u2019s heart so he could never love Lisa and slaughtering my parents so they could never argue again.  The gnashing of the teeth came from the bodies surrounding me.  They gnashed at one another and I couldn\u2019t see them but I could hear them and I could feel them moving around me, tearing away at one another.  \n\nTheir echoes bounced off of the walls surrounding me and they yelled for a name, for a girl, for a sister, \u201cLeslie!\u201d they howled, \u201cLeslie!\u201d\n\nShe isn\u2019t here, I thought.  \u201cShe\u2019s never coming back,\u201d I said and I heard it echoed back to me as the darkness finally took me with it, \u201cLeslie,\u201d it echoed, \u201cshe\u2019s never coming back!\n\nI woke up in a hospital some time later.  There were IV\u2019s sticking from my arm and I felt like my head was caved in.  The doctors surrounded me in their lab coats and they talked about me like I wasn\u2019t there.  Words and phrases like, \u201cseverely dehydrated,\u201d \u201cmalnourished,\u201d and \u201cmentally unstable,\u201d floated around the hospital room like the big red balloons someone had left at my bedside table.  \n\nWhen my parents reported me missing, the police asked if I had been exhibiting any strange behavior.  My dad told them that he believed I\u2019d broken into his office several times and that\u2019s where he kept all of his work.  The police decided to have the cave my dad was working in completely searched.  They found me deep within the cave, alone, without anything on me.  I was incoherent and apparently babbling about someone named Johnny and the sacrifices he was planning.\nIn the months following, bits and pieces of what happened to me in Moab began to come together.  \n\nThere was a reason I constantly found myself mixing up the names of Leslie and Lisa.  It was all coming back as sure as the sun was setting in a sky I thought I\u2019d never see again.  There was only ever Leslie.  My role model Leslie, my protector Leslie, my best friend Leslie, my sister Leslie.  My parents couldn\u2019t have a kid, that\u2019s when the tension started.  The fights began long before my father\u2019s job was an issue.  The fights began long before Moab happened.  \n\nAnd then there was Leslie, a miracle they called her.  They explained it to me when I was younger, they said, \u2018Leslie was born in our hearts, that\u2019s why the color of her skin doesn\u2019t match yours.\u2019  She was adopted, but then I happened.  I was the \u2018accident\u2019 Leslie had joked once, but my parents always said that I was their \u2018surprise.\u2019  They must\u2019ve been thrilled and hopeful; at least that\u2019s what they\u2019d always said.  I grew up and became another mouth to feed, another child for my mother to care for while my father was away and couldn\u2019t.  I was loved, we were both loved, but I caused stress.  And with stress came tension, until I was sure it was all going to break. \n\n\nThere was darkness and I saw the flashing lights before I heard them.  The wailing that means there\u2019s someone out there in pain and we need to get to them and we need to help them.  But they couldn\u2019t help her.  They couldn\u2019t help Leslie.  \nThe back left of our 1997 Toyota RAV4 was torn clean off when the driver of a tractor-trailer fell asleep at the wheel and plowed through the median.  I\u2019m not sure how many times the car rolled but it stopped right side up.  I remember looking to my left and seeing nothing.  Seeing nothing was worse than seeing her dead next to me.  Seeing nothing meant she was gone for good, and I could never see her again.  \n\nThe casket was closed but that\u2019s all I really remember about the time after her death.  My dad had been driving the car.  He was in the driver\u2019s seat, on the left, suppose it had been the front left instead of the back left part of our car torn off?  What then?  I\u2019m sure my mom juggled those questions a lot.\n\nThe same darkness that I experienced in the cave, that was the kind of darkness that loomed over our slightly emptier household.  There was a strange silence where Leslie\u2019s voice should\u2019ve been.  I remembered dealing with ignorant and mean kids growing up who would tell me that Leslie wasn\u2019t really my sister, that a white girl could never really be my sister.   I always knew they were wrong and that it didn\u2019t matter.  She was my sister even if she wasn\u2019t my flesh and blood.  But when she died, I believed them.  I believed that she wasn\u2019t my sister anymore and that was the worst darkness of all.\n\nWe would\u2019ve moved regardless of the job offer.  It just helped that my dad already had a job lined up in the town we were moving to.  My parents hoped that it would help get rid of the pain that had a face and a name.  I hoped it would get rid of the pain too.\n\nFor that first month or so it did seem to help me block out the pain.  Mostly because I was numb to everything around me.  Apparently it isn\u2019t good psychologically for a teenager experiencing severe emotional trauma to have no interaction with his peers.  That\u2019s why I met Lisa.  She was my coping mechanism. \n\nMy mind didn\u2019t fill in all of the details surrounding her because she wasn\u2019t a real person; instead, my mind gave Lisa the attributes of Leslie with the personality and looks to match while Lisa\u2019s sister Leslie was a completely different character my mind had created.  \n\nThe time Lisa came to my house, the therapist\u2019s say that the conversation she had with my mom was a memory my brain had made up; most likely, it was based off a true event that had happened before Leslie died.  They say I paired the fabricated memory with the conversation I had imagined while picking the lock on my dad\u2019s office door and rifling through his things.\n\nThey say most of the memories are like this.  There was a hotel though, but there was no Yamir.  He was a figment of my imagination as well, that\u2019s what the therapists told me.  They believe Yamir represented my insecurities.  A few weeks after they found me in the cave, a hotel receptionist came forward and said that she\u2019d seen me in Yamir\u2019s hotel.  I listened to her tell the police and doctors that she\u2019d seen me talking in a hushed voice, but no one was around me.  A few minutes after she\u2019d seen me go in there, she called security and found that I had gone up to the roof.  She went up there, unsure of how I\u2019d gotten in, and found me standing on the rooftop all alone during late twilight.  Since I wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong, and she could tell I was very upset, she decided to leave me alone.\n\nEmma and Johnny were also just figments of my imagination.  People my own mind made up to add to the realistic world and storyline I was creating for myself.  There were things the police and doctors weren\u2019t certain about; for instance, how I had gotten to the cave.  There was no evidence of anyone driving me and there was no car to suggest that I\u2019d driven myself.  \n\nAll of this knowledge, it wasn\u2019t something that all returned to me at once.  As I became more stable, I started to put together the bits and pieces.  I started to hold onto the information and events the doctors and police told me about.  I started to remember them as being true.  I got better, but I was still shaky on the same events no one else could piece together.  I still have no clue what really happened in that cave, just the dark and tainted memories that I do a good job of keeping out.   \n\nIt was difficult to deal with, I dreamed up realities where there really was satanic worship and I barely made it out alive.  Those dreams were easier than trying to comprehend my own insanity.  Sometimes I\u2019d even dream that Lisa made it out alive with me, that somehow I\u2019d rescued her and was a hero.  \n\nWe left Moab not too long after I started to forget and remember, remember and forget.  We moved to Minnesota and my dad helped advise construction on the lakes.  It was a beautiful place to live and even though we\u2019d always mourn Leslie and hide from what happened in Moab, Minnesota helped us begin to heal.  I never witnessed my father lay a hand on my mother after Moab and I never saw nasty bruises on her face or arms after Moab.  I wondered if that was a part of what I\u2019d imagined.  I wondered if that darkness was just in my head too.  \n\nNow here I am, sitting behind my computer, talking with you all.  The year is 2015, and it has been almost 16 years since what happened to me in Moab.  The only thing that remains the same is that I believe in God.  I believe in God because I found darkness in Utah that was so thick and tangible that it proved to me the devil exists.  You can\u2019t have one without having the other.  Moab, Utah made me believe in the devil; because of this, Moab, Utah made me believe in God.  \n\nNow I go to church often, my church is actually where I met my wife.  I moved with her back to Baltimore a few years ago and she\u2019s pregnant with a baby girl.  Even though that darkness is in my past, I do my best to eliminate it by filling my life with the light of my God.  That\u2019s my coping mechanism now.  \n\nNormally, I wouldn\u2019t have brought this to Reddit, but something happened two days before my first post that caused me to write this.  My wife was upstairs resting because she had done some cleaning while I was off at work; side note, I\u2019m a history teacher now if that interests any of you.  I was sitting in our living room on the recliner, eating a microwave dinner.  The Orioles v. Angel\u2019s game had just started, and I was happy to be relaxing before I had to start grading some papers.  There was a knock at the door, and I considered waiting till the commercial break to answer.  I knew that\u2019d be too long, and I didn\u2019t want to be rude.  Finally, I dramatically sat my recliner up right before climbing out of the pleather upholstery and crossing the few feet to the door.  I opened the door and my heart ceased to beat.\n\nThere was a man in front of me who was a spitting image of Yamir if he had been fifteen or sixteen years older.  He looked at me with warm brown eyes and said, \u201cIt\u2019s Lisa.  She needs our help.\u201d  \n\nI told him not to say another word and to go away or I would call the cops.  As long as he doesn\u2019t come back, I\u2019m not going to do anything.  This is all in my past.  My wife doesn\u2019t even know about what happened to me in Utah.  She knows that I had a sister, Leslie, who passed away but that\u2019s about all of my darkness that she\u2019s seen.  \n\nI\u2019m trying to convince myself that no one ever knocked on my door, that I didn\u2019t see Yamir, and that I didn\u2019t hear him saying Lisa\u2019s name again after so many years.  Forget and remember.  Remember and forget.  Just like the doctor\u2019s told me.  \n\nLater on, when I was laying in bed with my wife, she turned to me and I found myself appreciating her effortless beauty that radiated from all corners of her being.  \n\n\u201cI think I know what I want to name our princess,\u201d she was smiling and I was loving her smile.\n\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d I took her hands in mine.\n\nHer hands felt cold, \u201cLisa.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t answer.  \n\nWe said our prayers\n\nAnd\n\nWe said our Goodnights.\n"},"353":{"title":"The Third Wish.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/10mjjm\/the_third_wish\/","flair":null,"author":"lazlme","selftext":"An elderly man was sitting alone on a dark path.

My friends actually started watching it again shortly before \"Day of the Doctor\" was released. \"So we won't forget a single moment\", they said, but I digress. One of my friends, Alex, is practically the \"Smitty Werbenjagermanjensen\" of Doctor Who, in other words, #1 fan. He asked me to draw a Weeping Angel so he could use it as a prank on his little brother or something like that, and I was the known cartoonist\/artist of the group.

I'm staying with them until my parents get back from that cruise they went to in 2011, and they're still not back.

Anyhoo, as soon as I got finished from that essay, I decided I would get started on my Weeping Angel, because I did NOT want to fry my brain with that quiz (college life can be so hard). Let me mention before-hand that my grandparents have a garden with a fountain and a statue and everything, and now everything I am about to tell you will make sense. I went on Google images, got out a Weeping Angel and my sketch book, and began to draw. I began with the head, and when I got done with that and started on the eyes, I started shivering. For absolutely no reason. Until I looked outside the window.Wasn't there a statue over at the fountain? I don't remember it being right next to the flower pot. These thoughts went through my head as I stared at the back of a statue that had apparently moved. I went back to the Weeping Angel sketch but it.....changed.What was supposed to be a close up sketch of a Weeping Angel was now a sketch of the statue outside. Now listen here when I tell you readers out there when I tell you that I wasn't like those idiots in the horror movies when they just brush off that strange occurrence and realize their mistake too late, no sir.

However, the ensuing flood of posts by fellow redditors is what really got me interested in trying this out. I consider myself pretty rational and skeptical by nature, but all these other posts kept gnawing at my curiosity. I finally decided to try the Three Kings for myself last night, if nothing else than to satiate my own need to know for certain if it was in fact real or not. Here's what happened...\n\nI followed the set up outlined in the original post pretty faithfully. The only difference was that I did not have a fan. Our house has a nice basement, pitch black without the lights and no windows, so I think it was perfect for this. It being summer, most of my roommates have gone home for the break. (I share a five bedroom house off campus with four other students from my university) Luckily, one of my roommates is still here. For the sake of ease, let's call him Stu. Stu was already planning to stay up and play COD for a while so he agreed to be my failsafe. My \"power object\" was a stuffed teddy bear I had received for my birthday last year from my ex. Yeah, maybe it wasn't the best power object, but I didn't have anything better.\n\nI went to bed as it says in the instructions with my alarm set for 3:30AM. I woke up at 3:29 on my own, didn't even need the alarm after all. I guess I was really psyched for this. I went down to the room, and noticed the door was closed. At first, this gave me a little chill and for a moment I thought \"Shit, maybe it's real after all...\". I walked over to the living room real quick and asked Stu, who was busy fragging some newbs on COD, if he had closed the door. Stu...well stu likes to hit the bong...and he was a little stoned by this point, it took him a second, and then he was like \"Oh, shit dude...sorry...I forgot that you left it open on purpose.\" False Alarm.\n\nSo, after reminding Stu to come get me at the appointed time, I went back into the room and sat down in the \"throne\", making sure not to look into either mirror. I'll admit it's a little creepy. Sitting in a dark room, the only light coming from your flickering candle, flanked by two mirrors that you can just only see in your peripheral vision. It's creepy. Five minutes passed and nothing happened. Then ten minutes, then fifteen minutes...NOTHING HAPPENED. Then I started getting sleepy (it was 3:50 something after all). I don't know when I fell asleep, but at some point I nodded off right there on the throne. When I woke up,...it was already daylight. I had apparently spent the night sleeping on the floor next to my \"throne\". What a joke. Fucking Stu and his lazy stoner ass forgot to get me. I walk out into the living room and there he is, passed out on the couch, bong on the coffee table, xbox controller in his lap. Lucky for me the Three Kings was a bust, if some real exorcist shit had gone down I would have been screwed. Haha. \n\nBut, seriously...to anyone out there who was like me reading these posts and wondering...if just maybe there was some truth to this thing. Just do it. You'll always have that nagging doubt until you do it. No need for any of the failsafes or a friend because it's not real. Just wake up at 3:30, walk on down and sit on the throne. And you know what....just go ahead and stare right into the left mirror. Because there's nothing there. Just do it. Do it tonight.

The bathroom was under construction so I had to use the basement's. It was okay for the first 3 weeks until one night. On that night I had to take a major poop. Before my constipation, I had eaten at a local Mexican restaurant called, la\nfantasma, which means \"The Ghost\" in Spanish. Little to my knowledge, the restaurant has a specific meal that is supposedly haunted. So, when I went to take the poop, I saw a figure pooping next to me. It was a 4 foot male who had dark skin and blond hair. It was singing \"Party in the USA\" and its face reminded me of George Bush. I then grabbed my Obama sticker and splashed my toilet with Holy Water\n\nMORAL OF THE STORY: DONT VOTE FOR ROMNEY  "},"358":{"title":"The Date","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/lx987\/the_date\/","flair":null,"author":"scaredofpsychoguys","selftext":"This is the reason why I don't go to bars.\n\nWhen I was in college, I had the most traumatizing event in my life. This one night I went out with my friends to a club, and danced with random guys, as usual. I started to drink more than I used to, and started to get a little dizzy. Some guy took notice and approached me. He was really handsome, beautiful hair, gorgeous smile. He bought me more drinks and made small talk with me. He was charming, but the drinks he keep on buying me started getting me drunk. My friends apologized for me and took me home. We had each other number when I left.\n\nA week later, he called me and asked me out. We went to a nice restaurant, and he was more charming than last time. I was sober now so I could find more about him. He told me he was a lawyer for a well known firm, and he loved to travel. At some point he kissed me. He worked his way into me and we agreed on a second date, at his place. He said he would cook for me.\n\nThat evening I started to feel sick. Next morning, I had rashes in my legs and arms. I called my best friend to take me to the hospital, I was burning with fever. They looked at me and had me analyzed. Turns out I had some kind of bacteria, and the weirdest kind: It was found on graveyards an corpses, and it was mostly found on people with necrophiliac urges. \n\nThe hospital called the police, and I told them I was starting to date this guy. Turns out he was suspect in three cases, all involving missing girls. I had his address and gave it to the police. \nThe police went to his house, and the officer told me he had nine corpses in a room, all dressed with red lingerie. Some of them had been mutilated. They also found a hand in the refrigerator, but it didn't belonged to any of the girls. They found a bottle of wine with cyanide on it. \n\nThey didn't find him. \n\nEdit: Grammar."},"359":{"title":"The USA is going to change.

You see, lately the USA has become known as a country filled with fat, stupid people, and as a proud, wholesome man who loves where he lives, this is troubling to me. So I took it upon myself to get rid of this stereotype one person, and one state, at a time. This may scare many of you if you happen to be a bad kind of person. \n\nI started in Mississippi. Odell Smith was what most people thought of in Mississippians: he was a wifebeater, a slob, and a racist. He got a taste of his own medicine when I lynched him the way he'd lynched the blacks 40 years ago. Sure, he was an older man, but he was still deserving of death. I hung him up and set his obese wriggling body on fire until it was a charred, smoky corpse. \n\nIt was a pleasure doing this. I was able to satisfy my deep, dark desires and improve America's image. I went on to Houston, Texas, and employed a Mexican man, Hector Rios, to work for me. It was his illegal scum that was souring good old Texas's image, so once I had him alone in my garden, explaining what I wanted him to do, I grabbed the garden shears and drove them right through his skull. I buried his body under my flower bed, sold the house, and moved on. \n\nIn Miami, Florida, I picked up Maria, a sexy young Cuban girl who had taken to prostitution. Once I had her alone in my car, I strangled her with her own belt. Then, in Connecticut, I abducted snobbish, obnoxious 14-year-old Amber Whitaker, the spoiled and idiotic daughter of a wealthy lawyer, from the Bridgeport mall. Back at my place, I shot her and dumped the corpse far out in the Atlantic. After her, I killed Gino Morretti, who was stereotypical of the \"Jersey trash\" you'd see on the Jersey shore. \n\nI don't want to bore you with details, redditors, but I think you'd be interested to know that my next few stops included Oklahoma (where I killed a nutty religious homophobic mother abusing her gay son), Kansas (where I killed a Methodist pastor who spent too much time collecting money and not enough practicing what he preached), and Alabama (where I killed a Ku Klux Klan member). \n\nYou can thank me, my fellow Americans, for helping rid the nastiest stereotypes of the US. But so far, I've only got eight states down. Just wanted to let those of you here from Mississippi, Texas, Florida, Connecticut, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Alabama know that I've helped rid your (lovely) states of at least one undesirable, and to give those of you who have tarnished the reputations of other great American states a warning, because I'm coming for you. \n\nNo one has thought of linking these murders together yet, especially since half of these victims were never even reported missing. And like I said, if you're in one of those \"other\" states, you'd better watch out. \n\nSo long, reddit. \n\n-Uncle Sam.

I used to buy collectible items like coins and stuff. Well one day I was browsing around craigslist when I saw a really good deal on a 1901 coin. My first instinct was of course to buy it so I looked it over and it seemed like the real deal (note-some coins are fake). I emailed the guy about the offer and eventually he emailed me back. In the email he didn't really talk about the coin but I just put off and emailed him about the coin again. This time he actually talked about the coin and he sent me some more pictures of it.\n\n\n\nA couple days later after close consideration I decided to buy the coin so I emailed him and asked where we could meet. He said he worked days and he got off at 9:00 pm and it takes about an hour to get home so I said I would wait his house until he got home and make the deal. He said that was a good idea so we decided I should stop by tomorrow. \n\n\n\nThe next day I ate dinner at around 8:45 and then left because it would take me about an hour to get there. (note-the guy lives away from the city in a pretty remote area.) When I got there I grabbed my 15 dollars and waited for him to get there. While I was waiting my car battery died and started to feel pretty sleepy. I tried my best to stay awake but just as I was about to pass out I saw headlights in the distance. I looked at my watch and it was 10:00 pm.\n\n\nThe car pulled into the house's driveway and a middle aged looking guy with glasses and long hair got out of the car. I got out of my car and asked if he was ready to make the deal. He said yes and told me to come in his house. I told him it would be quicker if he just brought the coin out here but he insisted I went in. I finally just agreed with him and went inside. His house looked like something from the early 1900's. It was only 1 story and made of old bricks. When we got in it smelled like thousands of dead animals in one room. We sat down in the kitchen and talked. After 2 minutes of talking I asked about the coin.He said he has it in his room and he went to go get it.\n\n\nWhile I sat there I was sure I heard voices coming from the door next to the chair I was sitting in. When the guy got back I asked him about it and he said it was just his radio playing in the basement. I payed him the 15 dollars but he said he needed more. I told him  I did not bring any more money and that he said it would only be 15 dollars. He got very angry and he hit the table very hard. I quickly grabbed the coin and ran outside to my car. I got in my car and locked the doors. I tried to start but I remembered the battery was dead. The guy came running out of his house with a gun and shot my window. He reached for the lock but I smacked his hand away. That's when I blacked out.\n\n\n\nI woke up in a room filled with chains and other weapons. There were two other people in there missing limbs and covered in blood. I freaked out and tried to get up but I was tied up. Lucky for me there was a piece of glass next to me and one of my hands were loosely tied up so I grabbed it and cut my tied hand free. I cut the rope around my legs and got up. I grabbed a gun from the table and went upstairs. The guy was asleep so I didn't have to use the weapon. I sneaked around the house to find a phone and eventually found one and dialed 9-1-1.\n\n\nWhen the cops got there they arrested the main and said he was a wanted criminal. They unlocked the chained up people and took them to the hospital. I got a ride from the cop back to my house and I went to sleep. \n\n\nNow three years later i'm writing this story because the guy is about to get out of jail because he claimed it was his friends house and he didn't know and some how the judge believed him. The guy gets out of jail on March 1st of 2018. I already got an email from an unknown person telling me to watch my back. I will update this in March if anything happens.\n"},"361":{"title":"I never should have dated a Redditor [The Final Chapter]","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/2dhys2\/i_never_should_have_dated_a_redditor_the_final\/","flair":"Series","author":"Blake_Sunkist","selftext":"[Part 1](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/2de8yg\/i_never_should_have_dated_a_redditor_part_1\/)\n\nNormally, when you're on a train wreck of a date, you make an excuse to get the hell out of there.

But I wasn't going to end this date. I was gonna stick it through to the end. Then she would take me back to her hotel room. And then she would die. \n\nI finally got her to talk about something besides Reddit.\n\n\"So\u2026have you been watching any new TV shows lately? I'm really hooked on Orange is the New Black.\"  \n\n\"*What if I told you that I love that show?\"*\n\nI knew it was hopeless.

Could you please stop?\"\n\nI was afraid of what would happen next. Maybe she would cry or yell at me or throw her glass of wine at my face. But she was perfectly sweet about it.\n\n\"I'm so sorry! You should have said something earlier. And you let me meme this whole time, even though it annoyed you? Oh em gee, that is too sweet!\"\n\nThen she said the most wonderful thing. It was wonderful because it got us thrown out of the restaurant.\n\n\"*THIS GUY! THIS FUCKING GUY! THIS GUY GETS IT!*\" she shouted at the top of her lungs. \"*SOMEONE GIVE THIS MAN GOLD!*\"\n\n____________\n\nI was filled with nervous anticipation as we walked up to her hotel room. Actually, \"murderous anticipation\" would be a better way to describe it.\n\n\"I'm so glad you agreed to come here.. Trust me, I'll make it a night you'll never forget.\"\n\nShe was goddamn right about that.\n\n\"You are gonna *love* my friends!\"\n\n\u2026\n\nWait, what?\n\n\"What do you mean?

I guess this murder was gonna turn into a massacre.\n\n\"There's five of them- Good Guy Gary, Scumbag Sam- don't worry, he's not a real scumbag- Foul Bachelor Brad, Socially Awkward Andrew, and Insanity Ian. Be careful around Ian because he's legitimately insane. We have to keep him away from all sharp objects. But he's a really cool guy once you get to know him.\"\n\nI had no idea what to expect when we got to her door. Maybe it would be five guys standing around a computer discussing how to make the perfect Confession Bear. Maybe they would be furiously masturbating to a blown up photo of Good Girl Gina.\n\nShe opened the door.\n\nI wasn't expecting there to be blood everywhere, and I *really* wasn't expecting to see a guy wearing nothing but a horse mask, waving around a meat cleaver, and standing next to four severed heads.\n\n\"Ian, what the fuck?

Family means everything. Jobs, friends, and good and bad fortune all come and go, but family, that remains constant. I love my family with all my heart. We don\u2019t have much but what we have we share and try to make the best of. This vacation is nothing special, just a long meandering car ride to a beautiful little cottage lent to me for the week by an old friend.\n\nSome families yacht across the Mediterranean or take in the sites of Paris or Berlin. Us? We drive, we laugh, and we thank our lucky stars for what we have. Others may have more in riches, but we are billionaires when it comes to love. Sounds corny, I know that\u2014but deep down it\u2019s not corny. It\u2019s wonderful.\n\nWhen the trip began we were flush with anticipation and excitement, and perhaps a bit of fear. Not scary chainsaw fear but the innocuous fear of the unknown. What will we experience while we were out on the road far from the comforts of our backyard barbeques and television-sofa extravaganzas? Anything could happen to anyone when they stray from their comfortable environs. A drunk driver could plow into us as we drive through the murky night, a lightning strike could burn us alive, or a tornado could topple the car. We took these useless thoughts and buried them like pirate\u2019s treasure\u2014far from our conscious minds. Yet still they lurked under the surface, like barbs on a rose\u2019s stem.\n\nAllow me to take a moment to tell you about my small but lovely family. There is my wife Jane, a school teacher all 31 years of close-knit community and Sunday school lecturing. She\u2019s one-of-a-kind, Jane is. Thick, shoulder length brown hair, wavy not curly, and bright, big eyes that seemed to suck the very soul from my being when we met lo those many years ago. Her lips, like two plump loveseats pushed together on her smooth-skinned face, like two rabbits pouncing upon a dewy meadow.\n\nMy wife, she\u2019s a serious one, but not lacking whimsy. In fact, the funniest thing I ever heard in my entire life she said to me when we first began dating. I would share it with you but the setup is way too convoluted. Suffice it to say, she has a great sense of humor and a darting keen sense of self\u2014two things that attracted me to her immediately.\n\nMy son is named Marty. I know, I know, don\u2019t get me started, but it was Jane\u2019s dad\u2019s name and what was I going to say? As previously mentioned, he is all of ten years old but he\u2019s as wise as a sage on a hill in Tibet arranging colored sand into the shape of SpongeBob Squarepants. He has his mother\u2019s hair and it sits on his head like a deserted bird nest perched upon two boney shoulders. Is he funny? Yes, more like me than his mom. He has a dry wit, as they say. He sometimes reminds me of a fetus version of Bob Newhart. In fact, he looked a little like him when he was an infant. Bald, serious, and pale.\n\nChild number two is Jane Jr. I decided that gem of a name. After all, my mother\u2019s name was Gertrude and there was no way in hell that I would curse a daughter of mine with such a name. Yikes. I picked Jane simply because I figured that if she grew into half the woman her mother is she\u2019d be all-damn-right. I love both my girls equally. We call her JJ these days. Mostly to cut down on confusion as we holler each other\u2019s names back and forth like war chants on an Apache battlefield. \n\nSo we drove and we drove, and we spied with our little eyes, and we guffawed like a gaggle of laughing-gassed geese. Things were going swimmingly. We drove further and further towards our cottage for the week and we couldn\u2019t wait to get there.\n\nAfter the first full day of driving, north, straight toward our destination, we decided to pull into a roadside motel in order to sleep away the tiresome day and get recharged for the remainder of our trip. We finally found a place with a flickering neon sign that promised \u201cColor TV\u201d and occupancies. Together we all cheered and pulled over, as I slipped my credit card from my tight billfold and we barreled into the large room.\n\nOnce inside we teetered like zombies until we were tight under the sheets and blankets. There was a round of kisses and one by one we drifted off to sleep. Morning came like the blink of an eye, coffee was drunk, cheese Danishes eaten and we were in the car like four little Indians back on the warpath.\n\nI have never minded a long drive, but this one seemed a tad different. I kept checking the map, and although roadside markers seemed aloof, I knew I was headed in the right direction. We\u2019d get there eventually, I was sure of it. Yet this drive seemed to last longer than most others, and on the second day of full-on gas-guzzling combustion-engine gargling, my family began to drop off to sleep one by one like three tender raindrops falling from a cloud.\n\nAs the sun began to touch the tips of the tree tops, I looked over to my wife in the passenger seat. She sat there in suspended animation as if on a long space journey.  Her lower lip was slightly detached from her upper, leaving a moist and sexy strand of saliva between the two. My children were equally as unconscious in the back seat, a plastic sandwich bag of Gold Fish crackers between them, and their heads in opposite directions like two drunken scarecrows on an angry autumn evening.\n\nI swallowed the last of my gritty coffee as the sun fell just below the trees. The lighting in the car went from a golden yellow to moody blue in an instant. \n\nHell, I might as well drive through the night, I figured.\n\nIf I did, we could be at the cabin before the wife and kids awoke and I would be deemed king for a day\u2014day after, actually, for I assumed I would need at least a good eight hours of restful sleep before I would be able to join my family in their cabin-by-the-lake festivities. What\u2019s a loving husband to do if not take one for the team? I pressed down on the gas pedal as the darkened green trees beside me morphed into olive drab wallpaper.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long after the sun set that before me arose a conundrum. There was a fork in the road! I gazed over to my wife. She was sleeping soundly, but she was the one manning the map; the navigator, if you will. I decided to let her sleep and made a choice. I gunned the gas and swerved left.\n\nI was pretty darn sure that we were heading in the right direction. If I wasn\u2019t I would have awoken her from her slumber. No big deal, we were still heading north. Even if I made a mistake with regards to the fork, it\u2019d eventually work its self out, I surmised. As long as I didn\u2019t do anything stupid like pull a U-turn, we\u2019d be alright.\n\nI felt comfortable on this road, nothing seemed out of place. To begin with the scenery stayed mainly the same, so I reassured myself that I had made the right decision in regard to the fork. It was only after ten or so miles that I began to think that maybe I had chosen incorrectly. I saw a farmhouse out of the windshield. Usually this wouldn\u2019t have registered, except for the fact that as I gazed upon it I began to feel chills. They crawled up my spine from my lower back to the top of my head.\n\nI cannot say what it was about the structure that frightened me, but it did. All I know is that the feeling was real, it was genuine, visceral. For a split second I saw in my mind\u2019s eye a factory inside this farmhouse\u2014a factory of some sort. White Formica wall tiles, stainless steel boxes that housed electronics. What? What was I thinking?\n\nI saw infants in pens\u2026as pigs are kept. I saw filthy hoses attached to their mouths. Hoses like deteriorating garden hoses. The babies wriggled and moaned in their pens. I heard the sounds and I smelled the smells of the place as if I was standing inside it. I shook my head from side to side to dissipate these degrading images\u2014and it worked! There was nothing there but a quaint farmhouse shroud by a dusky mist. I watched it whiz by the window as I caught my breath.\n\nMy foot squarely on the gas pedal, I stared through the windshield attempting to figure out what the heck was going on. As I did the evening gently sunk back into normalcy. I was a father and my family slumbered beside and behind me. Then night grew dramatically darker\u2014as happens after dusk.\n \nAt that very moment a flock of birds\u2014or bats\u2014emerged from the darkness, swept over the hood of the car and up and over the roof like a torrent of black water. My foot pulled off the gas reflexively and I was about to plunge the breaks as the things cleared the back end of the car and continued their flight into the darkness behind me. I shook like a palm tree in a wind storm, but steadied myself, kept the car on the road and, thanked my lucky stars that a crash was averted.\n \nI was frightened, I admit it. My entire body was shaken, but I continued to drive, glancing every few seconds towards my sleeping wife in the passenger seat. I had been on the verge of waking her, but I composed myself and continued on our journey. I didn\u2019t want to bother her. After all, she needed this vacation as much as I did. So did the kids. I wiped my forehead with the back of my hand and continued on. We all needed this vacation. This I knew for sure.\n\nI drove many untold miles, my head eventually winding down with the last of the caffeine buzz, as on I journeyed. Oh, my family would be so happy when they awoke to find themselves in front of the cabin. The night turned darker each time a cloud floated by the moon. I cracked the window to get some air. At first it was pleasant, wet, dewy, grassy, the smell of woodlands at night\u2014delicious in its own unique way. Smells often trigger memories and I quickly remembered my many days and nights at summer camp when I was a child. My mind flickered with images of totem poles and daylong games of Color Wars. I smiled widely and chuckled out loud.\n\nWhat fun those early childhood days had been for me! I was a boy not from a quaint little town but from a teeming metropolis, and I was getting a chance to commune with nature. Wonderful, cheery, green-graced nature! It was right about then, in the midst of these great old memories, that I gazed up the road and realized I was confronted by another fork! I slowed down and again made the sole bold choice. It was soon after that my mood changed.\n\nI was immediately afraid I had made the wrong decision. The woods were definitely no longer sweet smelling and comfortable. They were turning, slowly, like a decaying corpse, into a different type of landscape. In front of my eyes I saw the land go from natural and wondrous to unfamiliar and frightening. The once sweet aroma that drifted through the cracked window changed and before long grew pungent and unbearable. The smell reminded me of rotting fruit forgotten on a kitchen table and covered in a dull fungal velvet.\n\nIn was then that my mind\u2019s eye seemed to blink. When my eyes again registered the trees they had become dead sticks jutting from scarred and desolate hills. They then morphed into crosses, weathered man-made crosses planted for miles around me, each one waiting for a degenerate soul to be crucified upon. The moonlight shone through the once unthreatening mist creating a yellow fog that crawled between these accursed appendages. In and out of the crosses this yellow ooze undulated, like a river rotten with rancid corpses.\n\nOn I drove, like a man on a mission. Or like a junkie, a heroin junkie, who had set his sights on a ghetto street corner and the dealer who lurked there. The moon began to grow brighter and I assumed a cloud had cleared its moonlight path, yet when I looked at it through the acorn and mosquito pock-marked windshield, I saw that it had grown brighter of its own accord. I saw the moon wiggle as a distant landscape seems to do on a hazy summer day. The moon shifted in the sky slightly and on its surface I saw a silhouette. I couldn\u2019t immediately make out the shape, but soon I saw it. I saw it clear as day: there was a face on the moon.\n\nThis was no cheery black & white Honeymooners-sitcom man in the moon. Oh no, it was a piss yellow violent and rancid face with huge blinking bloodshot eyes and a slightly upturned smile that exposed two entire rows of brittle and off-white cylindrically shaped sharp teeth. My heart almost burst from my chest cavity, it began beating so fast and hard that the steering wheel shook violently in my hands. Where was I? Who was I? No answers came, just sadness. Sadness and depression, an avalanche of misery fell down from that face upon my shoulders. I was very close to driving right off the road. \n\nThen the face noticed me! I was sure of it. It gazed down through the windshield at me, my wife and children\u2014and began to laugh. First, it was a low giggle, before long it was a deafening roar, a guffaw. My brain was battered by the decibels of the laughing full moon\u2014but my family didn\u2019t flinch. They remained sleeping during the entire terrifying episode.\n\nThings didn\u2019t get any better from there. In fact, when I looked at the road in front of me, I saw with no apparent deceit, a long and winding river of shit\u2014a gurgling, disgusting brown fecal fjord stretching to the horizon. In the distance I could see a giant mountain with metal pipes jutting from its face, and attached to those pipes were dirty eggshell white porcelain toilet bowls, and on those toilet bowls were innumerable human beings, faces grimacing and releasing their bowels.\n\nA mountain of shit-taking almost-corpses, prisoner of war camp refugees excreting their bowels as the moon howled. It was exactly then that I felt my car turn into a prison cell. The roof lowered immeasurably, and the two side doors seemed to cave in on me. I was being crushed by the weight of the roaring metal and I knew not what to do. I felt like a death row prisoner, long-lost of poetry and fables, but praying for the sin-eating governor\u2019s reprieve to come at any moment.\n\nThe entire night turned into a dragon\u2019s tail, a long meandering scaly whip that thrashed at my very being. The night became a terrorist turncoat, a friend who eventually stabs my back, twisting and turning the knife\u2019s blade in a crescendo of murder and mayhem. Where and when did it all turn bad? Where on this journey had a made a wrong turn? The forks! The forks dug into my eye sockets like rusted Swiss army knives from long forgotten childhoods. Like frogs dangling on strings by hick hooligans throwing home-made Chinese stars at them, I was now a victim of whatever fantastic phantasmagoria managed to rip through the veil.\n\nAnd the veil wasn\u2019t merely torn; it was shred to bits.\n\nThe car began to slow even though I was stepping on the gas pedal. It was as if I was no longer in control of anything. Obviously, this was not surprising to me as I was fast slipping into crazy land. My mind was torn asunder, my reality was being sliced and diced and I was unable to stop it. I gazed out the driver\u2019s side window and noticed the road beside me. It began to encircle the car. Not the road exactly but the dirt, the leaves, the soil, and larval creatures began to crawl from the depths of hidden holes. Giant worms and beetles, their black shiny shells reflecting the raucous moonlight emerged slowly at first, then faster. From lower levels rabid beasts ascended.\n\nThe car was encircled by these creatures, tentacles and pincers, hairy arms and bulbous eyes, and the gurgling\u2014that damned gurgling. The foul language of whatever had encircled me was getting louder and beginning to erase my thoughts, mashing my memories one by one. It was banging, banging on the car as if I was inside a riot. It was ripping the doors off with the Jaws of Life as if I were an accident victim. It was a cacophonous roe to gain access. There was a legion of crippled midgets and armless children wriggling in the mud surrounding the vehicle. I gazed upon these monstrous visions as my family slept like comfortable logs.\n\nI clenched my eyes tight and pounded on the gas pedal. The car once again picked up speed and we traveled headlong along the ribbon of the road until another fork arose. Without contemplation I tore right and the sky blackened as the car was enveloped in a thousand flapping leathery bat wings. Through the ink-black clouds hail began to fall, cracking onto the hood of the car like stones being tossed by a Bigfoot clan.\n\nMy mind beat like the thrashing of a nail-encrusted cat-o-nine-tails on a prophet\u2019s back, forming long deep lines of crimson on the inside of my skull cap. The flapping bat wings jelled together, quickly becoming one giant pair. They clapped closed one final time and then opened wide with a torrent of fetid rain water that splashed and gushed upon the windshield. I could no longer see a thing\u2026\n\nLike a sheet of black silk cloth, the water dripped down the glass. As the window cleared I saw it. There in front of the car was the cottage, my friend\u2019s summer home, the dwelling that we drove toward this entire long demented night! As the last of the water dripped from the windshield, the crack of dawn slipped from the horizon, filling the morning with a pinkish hue. We had arrived.\n\nI looked at my wife still asleep next to me. I heard her clear her throat\u2014a wonderful human sound, seemingly innocuous but sounding to me like the opening bars of a symphony. Two birds whistled off to my right. As I turned my head to spy them, my wife rubbed her tired eyes and began to smile. I knew she had to be as famished as I was, but surprisingly she wasn\u2019t.\n\nWhen I pointed towards the pile of fresh meat on the backseat I assumed she would be happy with the time and care I had taken with the filet knife. She was not.\n\nMaybe she\u2019ll change her mind if I offer her a fork?\n\n\n"},"363":{"title":"You have to help. Everyone has to help. My own riddle post needs to be solved or.

It\u2019s two thirty-two in the morning, but when you gotta go, you gotta go.  Alberto closes the bathroom door and locks it before doing his business.  Even though he\u2019s a 29-year-old bachelor, old habits die hard.  \n\nAlberto finishes his business and is about to flush when he feels a strange pang of fear.  There\u2019s no reason he should be scared, this is his house, all the doors and windows are locked, he\u2019s utterly alone\u2026there\u2019s no REASON, he tells himself.\n\nHe looks slowly to the bathroom door, securely battened down against\u2026well, against nothing, really.  Shrugging, he reaches towards the handle when he hears something that makes him stay his hand.  A kind of creak.  The house settling.  The wind blowing against the door.  A tree branch rubbing against the side of his house.  \n\nA footstep.  \n\nAlberto comes to his senses, realizing that he\u2019s been standing with his hand on the toilet handle for five minutes or so.  Slowly he withdraws his hand and joins it with its sibling, absentmindedly writhing the two together like lovers.  He listens again, but all he can hear is his own heartbeat.  Not a breath of wind.  He runs to the window, but of course it\u2019s black as pitch.  \n\nAlberto groans inwardly at himself, and grabs the toilet handle.  \u201cIf I\u2019m going to do it, then I\u2019ll just do it, and damn the torpedoes,\u201d he mutters.  Flush goes the toilet and Alberto braces himself for\u2026something, but the house remains silent, apprehensive.  Alberto laughs aloud to himself at his foolishness.\n\nAnd hears the noise again.\n\nAlberto\u2019s laugh stops dead, but his mouth still hangs open in surprise.  His eyes widen.  \u201cDid that sound come from the hallway?\u201d he asks himself.  \u201cThe acoustics in this house are shit.  I can\u2019t tell.  God.  God.  Probably not.  That\u2019s stupid.  Stupid stupid stupid.\u201d  He walks to the door and leans his ear against it.  The sound of his own breathing? Or\u2026\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my own breathing.  Obviously.  I mean, the house is all locked up.  I\u2019m alone in here.  No way in, right?  It was just me. \n\nObviously.\u201d\n \nAlberto withdraws his ear.  The toilet is still gurgling as it always does after a flush.  \u201cSince nothing is wrong, I\u2019ll wash my hands,\u201d he thinks.  \u201cYep, just wash my hands and head on back to bed.\u201d  His hands shake as he reaches for the faucets.  But before his hands can complete their mission, he hears the faint creak again.  Unlike the other incidents, however, this creak is accompanied by the door handle to the bathroom moving.  Maybe.  Since the handle is a shiny bronze sphere, it\u2019s really quite hard to see it moving.  It probably isn\u2019t.\n\nAlberto locks his eyes on the door handle.  Almost imperceptibly, it moves.  \n\nAlberto freezes, staring.  Yeah, it\u2019s moving. \u201cThe door in the wood is warping.  Hell, stranger things have happened,\u201d whispers Alberto.  However, the water still isn\u2019t running.  Alberto\u2019s hands have the faucets in a death-grip.  If it had a throat, it\u2019d be strangling.  Stupid thought.  Shakes his head.  Turns on the water.  And he hears\n\nHours later.  Alberto wakes up.  The water\u2019s still running.  Hell of a water bill I\u2019m racking up.  The window.  Still dark.  No watch.  Don\u2019t know the time.  Can\u2019t wait it out.  Stands up.  Falls.  Stands up again.  Door shut, handle stationary.  Just like normal.  Shit, I\u2019m shaking.  I\u2019m just cold.  The creak again, louder than ever.  Right outside the door.  And the\u2026other sound.  No doubt now.  Walks.  Hand on the doorknob.  I\u2019m going back to bed and sleeping and while I\u2019m asleep I\u2019ll dream of that girlIkissedinhighschooltheonewiththeblackhairandgreeneyeslikeacatorsomethingandilljustkissherkissherkissher\n\n\u201cSTOP!\u201d Alberto screams.  \u201cI HEARD THE HOUSE SETTLING AND GOT A BIT NERVOUS.  NOW I AM GOING TO BED.\u201d\n\nHis shout echoes through the house, fading away.  The house eats it.\n\nAlberto grabs the doorknob and turns it.  Not too slow, not too fast.  The lock clicks open at the exact same volume that it always clicks.  He opens the door.\n\nA month later, the police investigate a report from the water company claiming that the resident of 13 Pentwater Avenue hasn\u2019t paid his water bill and isn\u2019t answering the phone or the doors.

Many of my friends have died. It is very sad. \n\nFor all of the sadness, we are losing. I know we are losing. My commander does his best to keep our spirits up, but every day one of my comrades loses a limb. We pay every day for this war in fingers and ears, and even until now we are not winning. \n\nWe fight the regime, we fight Al-Nursa, we fight Al-Qaeda, we fight Da3sh. We fight each other sometimes too, if food runs low. Every day I pray to Allah that one day the fighting can be over and we can be peace again. \n\nAllah did not answer us. But around one year ago, something else did. \n\nOne day in our camp, a man came to our camp. He was a young Syrian man wearing American clothes, and nothing about him was special.  I don\u2019t know how he managed to get to our door without the guards shooting him, but he did. He talked to us of his leader. I don\u2019t know how to translate his name, I cannot find the word in English. The best I can do is \u201cThe Weeping Man\u201d.\n\nWe laughed at this messenger. It is a stupid name, and we told the messenger this. He only smiled at us. This was also strange.   He said, \u201cThe Weeping Man has heard your prayers. And he will answer. Come to the police station in three days and you will receive peace. \u201d\n\nOf course we said no. We told him to leave our camp. He then pointed at our camp doctor, Doctor Achmed. \u201cCome to the police station in three days, or else the Weeping Man will take his teeth\u201d\n\nOur scout Chaled took out his gun and shot this man as soon as he finished.  He used to work at a hospital in Homs, and he fought with us for over two years.  Very little makes him afraid. He said to me, \u201cI am not afraid of this messenger, or this Weeping Man. Let this dog to try take my teeth!\u201d\n\nThree days passed. In the night, Dr. Achmed screamed for us. We ran and found blood all over his tent. \n\nThey were gone. All of his teeth, they were gone. \n\nHe could not speak well since his teeth were missing, so he wrote down for us what happened. In the night, a group of men came into his tent and put something in his throat to keep him from speaking. They ripped his teeth out, one a time with something of metal\u2014I don\u2019t know how to say in English. Doctor Achmed's teeth came out of his mouth like carrots from a garden, and they left his tent with them, making no noise. \n\nAfter this, we did as we were told and went to the police station to see the Weeping Man. Allah forgive me for this, I wish on the soul of my brother that I had not.  \n\nThat is all I can say, It takes me a long time to write in English and I cannot stay in one place for long.

The SG Law is a code embedded in our national conventions code (in this timeline, you call it as the constitution) detailing how our society should act when it comes to matters pertaining to the subject of intradimensional, translinear, inter-universal travel.\n\nI will not disclose or tell any specific details of the law since it may cause a divergence range of 1e-20% divergence shift in the world line. However, after observing timelines after timelines shifting due entities or individuals attempting to send information about the future, there timelines have shifted so much many had even reached the divergence threshold of 1e-20% divergence shift.\n\nOne example of this is from Case No. 1022 which was a Class 4 divergence. An individual from 100 years into the future had warned his predecessor of an eminent war that was bound to happen in 10 years time in the future from that specific time point. There, he disclosed information on how the war will start and how it will be avoided. Indeed the war has been avoided. However, the individual who invented the concept that became the foundations of sending information back in time failed to be born. In addition to that, several individuals who are responsible for the technological, social and political reforms of the former timeline failed to exist in that timeline to. As a result, coupled with social problems brought by overpopulation and stagnation, the residents of that world line became extinct after a plague (which was avoided in the previous timeline due to advances made during the social reforms that took place 40 years after the war), a supervolcanic eruption and a meteor impact (which in the previous timeline has been struck by a space debris causing the asteroid to change course) struck the residents of that planet.\n\nCase No. 1022 shifted 1e-15% divergence from the original timeline.\n\nAccording to the SG Law, if one from the future would say anything about the future of that same timeline, the butterfly effect would then be activated thus changing the outcome of the world line. Every changes in the world line ranging from 1e-21 and below are divergence shifts that causes some changes in the timeline but not serious. However, world line shifts ranging from 1e-20% to 100% divergence shift, are what we call serious shifts. To give you all the idea of how much change 1e-20% divergence, imagine 2018 after Hitler became a painter, or Stalin dissolving the Soviet Union in 1945. On the other hand, for 1e-19% divergence, imagine 2018 where the Spanish Armada had successfully beaten the British Navy and Britain becomes a protectorate of Spain, or the person you know on this timeline as Genghis Khan was not born as a Mongol but as the crowned prince of the Chinese Empire.\n\nA warning to all: Never ever disclose or send any information to the past as it risks shifting the world line from one to another. It may cause a 1% divergence in the world line. According to the SG Law from Timeline No. ffhnbbjj32dn32o32655d23d_ , a world line that has diverged from the original timeline by 1%, the changes in the universe would be so great even quantum computers from 2036 would require 1 trillion trillion years to even create atleast 1 scenario for a time span of 8.457239e+50 planck time - in your concept of time, that would be ~1.4458 years (that is how long our year in our time concept is by the way).\n\nTo give you a gross estimation of how powerful our computers are, imagine all the processing power this world line has and multiply that by 1 billion and that is the processing power we are talking about here. \n\nAgain, never ever attempt to send any information back in time as it may cause a massive shift in the world line. \n\nYou have been warned.

The nearest town was 23 miles away. No cell service. We were staying at some sort of resort. The cabin we were staying in had another very close to it. It was occupied by family friends we had know for awhile. They had two kids Mikey and Risa. Risa brought a friend with. all three of them were around 15ish and i was only going into sixth grade. My three brothers(oldest to youngest Connor, Scott, Jack, me\/Griffin) and i were close. We did everything with Mikey tagging along. But one night we all decided to sneak out of the cabins at 2 a.m. and go on a \"nature walk\". The resort had a large golf course. That's what we had decided would be our journey. The night came around and we met up at the fire pit. Me, being the youngest, was scared because my brothers told of how there were serial killers in the forest. We started walking. It was dark and all we had were crummy flashlights we had found in our cabin. I was in the back of the group when it happened. It was so fast though and i was so young there was nothing i could do. There was a loud crash from the woods surrounding us and a some clank as Mikey's flashlight hit the ground. My brothers laughed and started shouting Mikey's name. They thought it was a joke 20 minutes later it wasn't so funny. MIKEY!!!! we all started screaming. I was scared so i ran off thinking i was running towards the cabin i didn't stop till i was lost. I broke down. Curled up into a ball and cried. I finally stopped and i heard something rustle by the bushes. I ran towards it thinking it was Mikey. When i got to the tree line i looked into the miles of ongoing woods. I saw someone....no someTHING. Its red eyes pursed me. It was about at the level of the bushes when our eyes met. Then it stood up. It was massive. Bigger than any bear. It stood 11 feet tall about 20 yards away. It ran off as my brothers came running towards me screaming and yelling at what ever was it the woods. As it started off in the other direction it dropped something. A.......leg.

Half of my stuff came from there. Most of the products were good quality and cheap as chips. Best of all, there was free shipping. You could get almost anything there, from makeup brushes to electronic gadgets. I especially loved shopping for cute cat t-shirts and costume jewellery. I've always had a fabulous experience shopping there, until my most recent purchase.\n\nI looked down at the aged pair of earphones I owned. The plastic earbuds were loose and nearly falling off; I had to keep clicking them back into place every so often. Rubber was beginning to peel off the cable in thin strips, exposing the wires within. I figured I had another month of use before it would stop working completely. Just long enough for a replacement to arrive. \n\nJumping on Aliexpress, I managed to find a new pair of earphones for around 5 dollars. Like I said, super cheap. It looked pretty decent from the pictures. There weren't any reviews either but I wasn't too bothered. It was only a few dollars and if it turned out to be a dud, I could just skip my Subway lunch to make up for the loss.\n\nThe next morning, I headed down for breakfast. My father was already seated at the table, drinking his usual black coffee.\n\nI greeted him with a cheery, \"Good morning!\" and sat down with some toast and a glass of orange juice.\n\n\"There's a parcel for you on the hallway table. Arrived this morning,\" Dad murmured, not glancing up from his newspaper.\n\nI paused, midway through spreading Vegemite on my toast, and ran to retrieve the parcel. It had some Chinese characters on the label. I ripped the packaging off to find a pair of earphones.\n\n\"That's pretty quick for Aliexpress,\" I thought, elated yet somewhat perplexed. In my experience, shipping usually took ages, ranging from 3 weeks to a couple of months. Definitely not _overnight_. However, who was I to complain? I examined the earphones. The design was pretty state of the art, with blue coloured chrome covering the earpieces and a long, sturdy cable. On the underside of the volume control button, there were some letters engraved in fine print. It was something foreign; \"m\u00f3gu\u01d0\" was what it said.\n\n\"Probably the fake Chinese version of Bose,\" I laughed, plugging it into my phone to test the sound quality.\n\nIt was superb. The music was crisp and clear. I could hear the bass of my song, made prominent by the earphones. It was almost like being in a live concert. I thumped my head along with the beat, immersed in the glorious music. At the same time, I was congratulating myself on managing to find such a bargain!\n\nMy father tapped me on the shoulder, indicating that we would leave in 10 minutes. He usually gave me a ride to work on his way to the office so I quickly got ready to leave.\n\nWork was long and arduous. I finally got home and showered quickly, washing the grease and smoke that had impregnated my hair during my shift spent deep-frying chips. I plugged in the earphones and settled into bed to relax to some music.\n\nI had been listening for around half an hour when the song that was playing stopped abruptly. There was silence. I checked the pause button to see if I had accidentally tapped it but the screen still showed the song as playing. So I unplugged and plugged the earphones back into my phone, figuring that was where the problem lay. The song continued as before until _it_ happened again 15 minutes later.\n\nThis time, the song was interrupted by a strange, unintelligible chanting. It was in a language I could not understand and sounded somewhat _religious_, yet ominous. At the same time, a terrified feeling settled upon my being and I felt a sudden chill in the air, causing my skin to prickle. I tore the earphones off after a minute or so; the chanting had grown louder and louder, reaching an intense, unendurable, _crescendo_.\n\n\"What was that?\" I gasped, shaking. There was a light sheen of sweat all over my arms and legs. The earphones laid on my duvet cover, cables twisted menacingly.\n\nI cut them up and threw them away. There was obviously something wrong with the earphones, I don't know what, but it was _unnatural_. I went to sleep.\n\nI woke up, tired and groggy. All I could hear in my dreams was that goddamn _chanting_, a neverending soundtrack to the empty darkness that shrouded my mind in my sleep. I went about my usual routine. I was on my way to work when I began to hear the chanting again. This time, it didn't stop.\n\nAnd it hasn't for a month. As I write this, the interminable noise has gone on for 31 days or 744 hours or... or- I don't care. All I know is that every second it grows worse. The chanting gets louder and more _evil_. I'm trying to write this down quickly as I suspect I won't be able to do very much very soon. I just want the noise to stop but it won't, I've tried everything. \n\n_Oh please, please make it stop!_\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNote:\n\nThis is Cecilia's father. Unfortunately, Cecilia passed away three days ago. I found her in bed, dead. All I can say is please buy your earphones from a proper shop and not some shady site. Look what it's done to my daughter! I can't even have an open casket at the funeral. You see, she had cut off her ears and gouged out the internal parts as well. I just wish I had listened.\n\n\n"},"376":{"title":"I don't know what to do with my son Dylan...","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/27vfqm\/i_dont_know_what_to_do_with_my_son_dylan\/","flair":null,"author":"deuter72","selftext":"I need advice Reddit. I'm lying here in my bed with Wifey and we can't sleep. We're ... we just don't know what to do with our son Dylan anymore.\n\n5 years ago, Wifey and I moved to another part of the city to start life anew. Soon after moving into our new apartment, our lives soon returned to normalcy. Even better, Wifey's health recovered and then, we found out to our delight that she was pregnant. Few months later, our first child, a son whom we named Dylan, was born.\n\n\nSince a baby, Dylan had **refused** to be held by Wifey or myself. Every time we picked him up, he would struggle, cry and scratch our faces. But he would be perfectly happy being left alone. Worse, he would reject Wifey's milk if she tried breastfeeding him. She had to resort to pumping her milk into bottles for him to drink.  This has obviously taken a toll on Wifey and I. She's more fragile emotionally than me, and some nights, I would see her sitting next to Dylan's crib crying. It is difficult for a mother to stomach the fact that her only flesh and blood is rejecting her.\n\n\nThings didn't get better as Dylan grew older. His first word wasn't mama or papa, but **No!**. At 2 when he learned to string words together, he would say things like \"Not real mommy! Not real papa. Want real daddy and mommy\". He still wouldn't let us hold him. Because we don't drive, going out is a hassle if we had to hold him. Once, Wifey almost dropped him on his head as we struggled to get out of the cab. The past 2 + years, Wifey's emotional wellbeing was being tested so badly. Both of us have grown thinner and sadder. We love our son so much. We've never laid a finger on him. Why did he hate us so?\n\n\nBut the worst thing happened just yesterday. It was Dylan's first day at preschool. We specifically told the teachers Wifey would pick him up at 4pm. When she arrived, the teachers and her realised Dylan has disappeared.\n\n\nWe were frantic. Calls we made, police was alerted. Less than an hour later, police found him wandering a block from the preschool. It really drove us crazy.\n\n\nThat evening, Wifey and I sat him down.\n\n\"Why did you run away Dylan?\" Wifey and I were perplexed.\n\n\"I want go home!\"\n\n\"You're home.\" I said gently.\n\n\"NO! Real home! With my real mommy and daddy! You're NOT my mommy and daddy!\" \n\nThat really made Wifey cry.\n\nI was exasperated and frustrated, and I shouted, the first time ever, at my son \"WE ARE YOUR REAL MOMMY AND DADDY AND YOU'RE OUR DYLAN!\"\n\n\nSilence.\n\n\nThen ... in his calmest voice ...\n\n\n\"No. My name is Christopher MacDonald. My mommy is Laura, and my daddy is Charles. I live in 57th Avenue. I have a brother Tommy.\"\n\n\n\"No...\" my wife stuttered. We were both stunned. Like the floor had just opened up and we were going to fall into it. \"Please don't say that...\"\n\n\"You kill me. You kill me!! You bang you car on me and KILL ME! Mommy cried and hold me but you and YOU just stare at me. You keep saying SORRY SORRY. NO!!! You stupid you!! I hate you!!\" Dylan started to tear.\n\n\nWifey let out a scream and ran towards the balcony. I knew what she was going to do. I knew she couldn't handle the revelation. We couldn't. I ran after her and snatched her before she climbed up the ledge and we both fell onto the floor, crying.\n\n\n\"I want to go home to my real mommy and daddy. Mommy, Daddy and Tommy miss me for so long. They must be very sad. I don't want them to be sad. Please bring me back.\"\n\n\nThat was the first time our son has ever said *please* to the both of us.\n\n\nIt's past 12 now. I'm lying in my bed, holding Wifey who has been crying non stop since.\n\n\n\"Should we return him to Laura and Charles?\" Wifey asked.\n\n\nI don't know. I really don't know.\n"},"377":{"title":"Pokemon: Black version","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/gbt0x\/pokemon_black_version\/","flair":null,"author":"ds98","selftext":"I\u2019m what you could call a collector of bootleg Pok\u00e9mon games. Pok\u00e9mon Diamond & Jade, Chaos Black, etc. It\u2019s amazing the frequency with which you can find them at pawnshops, Goodwill, flea markets, and such.\n\nThey\u2019re generally fun; even if they are unplayable (which they often are), the mistranslations and poor quality make them unintentionally humorous.\n\nI\u2019ve been able to find most of the ones that I\u2019ve played online, but there\u2019s one that I haven\u2019t seen any mention of. I bought it at a flea market about five years ago.\n\n[Here](http:\/\/media.tumblr.com\/tumblr_l687r1Rn041qzpbds.jpg)\u2019s a picture of the cartridge, in case anyone recognizes it. Unfortunately, when I moved two years ago, I lost the game, so I can\u2019t provide you with screencaps. Sorry.\n\nThe game started with the familiar Nidorino and Gengar intro of Red and Blue version. However, the \u201cpress start\u201d screen had been altered. Red was there, but the Pok\u00e9mon did not cycle through. It also said \u201cBlack Version\u201d under the Pok\u00e9mon logo.\n\nUpon selecting \u201cNew Game\u201d, the game started the Professor Oak speech, and it quickly became evident that the game was essentially Pok\u00e9mon Red Version.\n\nAfter selecting your starter, if you looked at your Pok\u00e9mon, you had in addition to Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle another Pok\u00e9mon \u2014 \u201cGHOST\u201d.\n\nThe Pok\u00e9mon was level 1. It had the sprite of the Ghosts that are encountered in Lavender Tower before obtaining the Sliph Scope. It had one attack \u2014 \u201cCurse\u201d. I know that there is a real move named curse, but the attack did not exist in Generation 1, so it appears it was hacked in.\n\nDefending Pok\u00e9mon were unable to attack Ghost \u2014 it would only say they were too scared to move. When the move \u201cCurse\u201d was used in battle, the screen would cut to black. The cry of the defending Pok\u00e9mon would be heard, but it was distorted, played at a much lower pitch than normal. The battle screen would then reappear, and the defending Pok\u00e9mon would be gone. If used in a battle against a trainer, when the Pok\u00e9balls representing their Pokemon would appear in the corner, they would have one fewer Pok\u00e9ball.\n\nThe implication was that the Pok\u00e9mon died.\n\nWhat\u2019s even stranger is that after defeating a trainer and seeing \u201cRed received $200 for winning!\u201d, the battle commands would appear again. If you selected \u201cRun\u201d, the battle would end as it normally does. You could also select Curse. If you did, upon returning to the overworld, the trainer\u2019s sprite would be gone. After leaving and reentering the area, the spot [where] the trainer had been would be replaced with a tombstone like the ones at Lavender Tower.\n\nThe move \u201cCurse\u201d was not usable in all instances. It would fail against Ghost Pok\u00e9mon. It would also fail if it was used against trainers that you would have to face again, such as your Rival or Giovanni. It was usable in your final battle against them, however.\n\nI figured this was the gimmick of the game, allowing you to use the previously uncapturable Ghosts. And because Curse made the game so easy, I essentially used it throughout the whole adventure.\n\nThe game changed quite a bit after defeating the Elite Four. After viewing the Hall of Fame, which consisted of Ghost and a couple of very under leveled Pok\u00e9mon, the screen cut to black. A box appeared with the words \u201cMany years later\u2026\u201d It then cut to Lavender Tower. An old man was standing, looking at tombstones. You then realized this man was your character.\n\nThe man moved at only half of your normal walking speed. You no longer had any Pok\u00e9mon with you, not even Ghost, who up to this point had been impossible to remove from your party through depositing in the PC. The overworld was entirely empty \u2014 there were no people at all. There were still the tombstones of the trainers that you used Curse on, however.\n\n \n\nYou could go pretty much anywhere in the overworld at this point, though your movement was limited by the fact that you had no Pok\u00e9mon to use HMs. And regardless of where you went, the music of Lavender Town continued on an infinite loop. After wandering for a while, I found that if you go through Diglett\u2019s Cave, one of the cuttable bushes that normally blocks the path on the other side is no longer there, allowing you to advance and return to Pallet Town.\n\nUpon entering your house and going to the exact tile where you start the game, the screen would cut to black.\n\nThen a sprite of a Caterpie appeared. It was the replaced by a Weedle, and then a Pidgey. I soon realized, as the Pok\u00e9mon progressed from Rattata to Blastoise, that these were all of the Pok\u00e9mon that I had used Curse on.\n\nAfter the end of my Rival\u2019s team, a Youngster appeared, and then a Bug Catcher. These were the trainers I had Cursed.\n\nThroughout the sequence, the Lavender Town music was playing, but it was slowly decreasing in pitch. By the time your Rival appeared on screen, it was little more than a demonic rumble.\n\nAnother cut to black. A few moments later, the battle screen suddenly appeared \u2014 your trainer sprite was now that of an old man, the same one as the one who teaches you how to catch Pok\u00e9mon in Viridian City.\n\nGhost appeared on the other side, along with the words \u201cGHOST wants to fight!\u201d.\n\nYou couldn\u2019t use items, and you had no Pok\u00e9mon. If you tried to run, you couldn\u2019t escape. The only option was \u201cFIGHT\u201d.\n\nUsing fight would immediately cause you to use Struggle, which didn\u2019t affect Ghost but did chip off a bit of your own HP. When it was Ghost\u2019s turn to attack, it would simply say \u201c\u2026\u201d Eventually, when your HP reached a critical point, Ghost would finally use Curse.\n\nThe screen cut to black a final time.\n\nRegardless of the buttons you pressed, you were permanently stuck in this black screen. At this point, the only thing you could do was turn the Game Boy off. When you played again, \u201cNEW GAME\u201d was the only option \u2014 the game had erased the file.\n\nI played through this hacked game many, many times, and every time the game ended with this sequence. Several times I didn\u2019t use Ghost at all, though he was impossible to remove from the party. In these cases, it did not show any Pok\u00e9mon or trainers and simply cut to the climactic \u201cbattle with Ghost.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what the motives were behind the creator of this hack. It wasn\u2019t widely distributed, so it was presumably not for monetary gain. It was very well done for a bootleg.\n\nIt seems he was trying to convey a message; though it seems I am the sole receiver of this message. I\u2019m not entirely sure what it was \u2014 the inevitability of death? The pointlessness of it? Perhaps he was simply trying to morbidly inject death and darkness into a children\u2019s game. Regardless, this children\u2019s game has made me think, and it has made me cry."},"378":{"title":"The Twitchy Kid working Drive Thru","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/4t9k2s\/the_twitchy_kid_working_drive_thru\/","flair":null,"author":"wholychao","selftext":"Ok. I think I can tell this in one go.\n\nThis happened a while a go. I've been trying to decide if I'd actually take the time to try and describe it to you. But I've got to get it out.\n\nIt was at the burger joint. I'm not sure I should say the name of the franchise. They've got nothing to do with it. Great food. Everyone should go there, it just happened to happen there.\n\nI was going out to lunch with my buddy Biron. Obviously, not his actual name. I was on lunch break from work and he didn't work. We go to this burger place all the time. A whole crew of us do, it's kinda was the only thing we all had in common. We were that midnight parking lot crew.\n\nBiron called us the Burger Knights. He called us that after the first time we did it. And we'd done it a lot once we got started. No, it's not what you think. I've got to ease into these things better. I mean, we got people fired.\n\nEver been to a burger place when they're training new staff? Don't. If you see some kid spilling oil or looking around like a lemming for leadership or you see the greasy smoke of a poorly managed grill you should run away. It will suck. I assure you. The kitchen crew are generally too busy keeping this whelpling from cutting his own thumbs off to do their own fucking work and the quality of the food goes straight down the toilet.\n\nTo Biron this was unacceptable.\n\nThis new guy was really screwing things up at our burger place. So, Biron got a few of us together, the core of the Burger Knights, and we went on the first war path. There were four of us. Me, Biron, Rusty and Boner.\n\nThe problem kid was working the drive through register. For those of you who don't know, in a kitchen crew there will usually be three or four people listening in to the chatter on the drive thru order box. The only one you talk to is whoever is working the register. But you can bet a manager babysitting the fries is listening and making fun of you viciously in hopes of impressing the girl working the grill, who is also listening.\n\nWe roll up and start giving an order to the kid. Then change the order after he repeats it. Only slightly changed, so it could be a mistake. Then keep changing the order and keep getting angrier, and louder. Trying not to laugh as we do. Finally Biron yells, \"If you can't understand English I'll just spend my money somewhere that can!\" And lays rubber down as we exit the drive thru.\n\nTwo days later we go back and the kid is gone. Biron asked the manager, just to be sure. But yeah, the kid got shitcanned. Biron was elated. That night he got a thirty rack of pebber opened his trunk in middle of the strip mall parking lot and the Knights celebrated for the first time.\n\nI was thinking about the rest of the times, but what matters is what happed... I almost said yesterday, but it's been almost a week. Damn it. I still haven't heard anything else or from anyone else. The place is still closed. It looks like they've cleaned up this inside, but. But I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nSo, screwing up drive thru orders worked for a while, but not forever. We had to get more creative. Boner created the Pink Shake Trick. That's where he'd demands a pink shake. This place has vanilla and chocolate shakes. Really, really thick ones. But Boner would demand a Pink Shake and once he felt sure the counter guy understood what he was demanding he would drive up to the window and wait. Just sit there and wait. And if anyone would ask he'd just keep demanding a Pink Shake.\n\nSix times out of seven, it would end with the counter guy insisting that such a thing didn't exist. Boner call the 800 number listed on all the receipts and tell them that the kid was refusing to provide for a simple request. Corporate never asks too many questions. Most Big companies are 'shoot first, ask questions never' from the top down. The kid was gone inside of a week. I mean, not as elegant as some of the tricks, but it did work.\n\nOh, and that seventh time. The kid actually made a god'amn pink shake. Boner was stupefied for a second. Sitting there looking at the pink milkshake in his hand. Then he threw the shake at the window and told the kid he wanted green. The shake exploded everywhere. I think some was even dripping down from inside the glass.\n\nIt even splashed back on Boner. He licked his hand as we drove away. He eyes tighten up a little and he says, \"I think that kid mixed BBQ sauce into the shake. It's actually pretty fuckin good!\"\n\nWe laughed about that one for the rest of the night.\n\nSo, about a week ago, when I'm out at lunch with Biron it goes bad from the moment we roll up on the order box. The kid is awkward and stilted when he talks over the speaker. Says he can't hear us half the time, and we're not even messing with the kid at this point. Either he just can't hear or hasn't figured out how to wear the headset. Then, when we get to the window, he's stumbling around looking for his co-workers, cuz he doesn't know what to do. You may not have picked up on this little detail, but Biron did. Kid was all alone on headset. If he's looking for his co-workers, that means they're off com and have left him in the weeds.\n\nThis kid was a goner. I almost felt bad. Mostly, because I could see in Biron's eyes that he had tasted blood. Biron says to me, \"Call the Knights. We're going on Warpath tonight.\"\n\nOh, had I mentioned he'd started calling it Warpath by that point. I mean, I don't think he knew anything like this might happen. He's just a dramatic guy. I reminded him that I was still on the clock, but he wanted to get started with whoever could make it right now. \"Just look at this kid,\" Biron spit, \"This can't wait.\" At the time, I actually agreed with him.\n\nOnce we finally got our food I put out a text to see who was around. There were a few responses by the time he dropped me off at my job. He told me to get over to the parking lot as soon as I could so I could join up with them. As he's driving off he shouts back at me, \"Bring a thirty rack!\"\n\nThe parking lot was less that a half mile from the burger place, so we kept all our cars there and would pack up into one car at a time to fuck with the kid. When I got to the parking lot there were six cars there and two people sitting around listening to music. It was just after dark and Biron had been fucking with this kid all day.\n\nI sat and shot the shit with the two guys there, low level kids who had just made it to a few gatherings but hadn't been on Warpath yet. They were excited. What can I say, there's not much to do in a bigish little city in the middle of fucking nowhere.\n\nSoon enough, the car comes rolling back through. Boner is driving and Biron is whooping like a madman in the backseat.\n\nHe jumps out of the car and sees me. He trows up his hands and runs at me shouting, \"Eight!\", then he grabs my shoulders and continues, \"Six out of eight!\" and laughs. I start laughing too. This kid has actually made a pink shake! This is going to be an epic night. At least, that's what I thought at the time.\n\nWe all piled into Biron's car to make another run at the burger place. I'm in the backseat, center. And Biron is shouting back at me as he navigates the three tight corners between the parking lot and the burger joint. Apparently, this kid looks like he's just about to have a psychotic break. And we're about to watch Biron to his Triple Burger bit.\n\nIt's a lot like the original bit, but Biron orders three burgers then specifies a super complicated toppings request and tells the counter kid that all three burgers should be the same. The kid confirms the order, then Biron starts another different topping request. The kid is confused, which makes sense. Biron explains that it's a simple order of three burgers and gives an entirely new topping request.\n\nThe guys are having a really hard time holding it in at this point, but we know if we laugh this kid might realize what's going on, so everyone holds it in while Biron tells the poor kid he just wants one burger with triple patties. There is long drawn out moan of agonizing death ended with a brief attack of hyperventilation. Biron just shouts \"Triple Burger, make it happen.\" And pulls up to the window.\n\nRusty is in the front seat and he starts laughing. \"Dude, look! They haven't cleaned up the Pink Shake.\" He shuts up quick, but we can all see the pink stain dripping down the glass. He's right. It's hilarious. We're all wondering what this kid is going to give Biron, but we all know what ever it is it's going to be wrong. Kid hands him the bag saying, \"Here you go, three triple burgers. That'll be $16.66\"\n\nBiron starts trowing burgers back at the kid and yelling. \"I only asked for one burger, asshole!\" Poor kid is trying to dodge sloppy incoming burgers that are fragmenting on him while Biron keeps yelling, \"I'm not paying for these, and I'm not paying for this one!\" opening the last burger and taking a massive bite out of it before speeding away.\n\nI think the kid was actually twitching before I lost sight of him through the back windows. The last thing I noticed was a tomato slice that had been stuck to his face falling to the floor. Fucking kid.\n\nWe turned the one way onto the parkway and veered off back towards the parking lot we were all whooping it up. These was the best night I'd ever seen and it was only the first run I'd been on. I didn't know, I would have stopped.\n\nRusty had come up with a new trick and we were going to run it next. It was Rusty's bit, so we all piled into Rusty's car. Everyone wanted to know what it was, but outside of clearing it with Biron, he just said he wanted it to be a surprise. Biron wasn't going to say anything either, but he was grinning from ear to ear.\n\nWe got to the burger joint and Rusty pulls into a parking spot behind the order box. If your having trouble picturing it, it's like a big u-loop, with a few parking spots in the middle of the 'u' - to not waste space, I guess. Rusty shuts off the engine, and we all want to know what's going on. But he just waits, listening to the radio till the song is done. Then he tells us something I'd known but hadn't thought much about. \"You know those order boxes are always listening, even if there's no one there.\" I'm still confused, all of us in the back seat at least. Biron is just grinning in the front.\n\nRusty jumps out of the car and walks up to the side of the menu board, just outside of the security camera. Don't ask how we knew where the cameras are pointed. He's just standing there. Then Biron rolls down his window and we can hear Rusty talking. Just barely.\n\n\"They all want you to go,\" He's saying, \"Think about it. They've got it out for you. They want you gone. Where are they. Are they watching you. Is somebody watching you. Why are you even here. You should do it. Just do it. Why don't you. You know they're out to get you. It's only a matter of time. They deserve it. Do it. It's the only way.\"\n\nAnd he's just going on and on. Fucking amazing. I don't know where this kid comes up with this shit, but it's amazing. They guys are all on the edge of conniption fits trying to hold down the laughter. This is the most epic night of Warpath ever. I mean, there's no way this kid can take it. Fuck.\n\nAfter about twenty minutes, Rusty gets back in the car and we drive back to the parking lot and crack open the thirty rack. Then... I guess we forgot about the kid. We started telling war stories about the best runs we'd done before. And hour turned into two or three, and the next thing you know it's really, really late.\n\nBiron decides he wants to roll past the drive thru one last time. They're closed, but not by a lot. There's a good chance we'll get a chance to see the kid mopping up the kitchen, and for some reason Biron really liked watching that. I guess it made him feel superior, or victorious. I could never really work out what kinds of feelings Biron was having. But I didn't care, I wanted to go too.\n\nA few people went home, so there were only three of us on that last drive by. We rolled up slow on the order box. Suddenly we all lurched forward. Biron had slammed on the breaks. We all knew why, we all heard it. The second we were at the order box it started talking. He started talking. \"Please drive thru. Nobody can help you now. They're all gone.\" Nobody said anything, but the kid just kept repeating \"Please drive thru. They're all gone.\" over and over. Even as we pulled up he kept repeating over and over again.\n\nThe window was closed. The kid was sitting there staring out the window. Not at us, I don't think he was actually looking at anything. He would twitch occasionally. We couldn't hear the order box speaker and like I said, the window was closed. But his lips were moving and I think he was just repeating the same things. The somebody shouted \"Drive!\"\n\nThe car didn't go anywhere. And the scene in the kitchen was starting to come into focus. It looked like there was fry smoke thick in the air. The night manager was bent over into the fryolator. The oil boiling over where his face went in. The voice shouted again, \"Drive!\" I think it might have been my voice.\n\nOn the floor by the front counter I could just barely see the body of the grill girl. I could only tell by her hair. Her face was mostly gone. Her fingers were gone and blood pooled around her hands. She was dead. I mean, I don't know, but I wish for her that she was dead.\n\nThen the window opened and the kid turned his blood spattered face towards us and said \"Drive.\" Biron screamed and the car lurched forward.\n\nWe didn't say anything on the way back to the parking lot. There was nothing to say. We all got into our cars and drove away. I didn't sleep at all that night. I thought about writing it down for you. I tried, but I just couldn't.\n\nThe next day I drove past the burger joint on my way into work. There were cop cars in the parking lot and the doors were block off with police tape. There was nothing in the newspapers. There are a lot of people wondering what happened. Three of us know for sure. But none of us have said anything. I haven't heard from Biron since that night. I haven't been back to the parking lot since. I really have no idea what to do. I haven't been able to sleep since that night. Maybe I can sleep now. I'm going to try.\n"},"379":{"title":"I love my sister!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/8o7bzx\/i_love_my_sister\/","flair":null,"author":"saltshaker78","selftext":"My name is jimmy, I live with my sister after my mom and dad got a divorce. Since I'm with my sister, she said that she always need to go to work, so she put me incharge of the house whenever  she works. I'm always alone that's why my sister always reminded me to lock the doors and if a bad guy shows up I need to dial the police number 9-1-1. I cook, I clean and play whenever I'm bored, but never tell my sister that sometimes I'm stealing a dollar on her wallet for my \"salary\".\n\n\nOne night my sister came home late, and she smells like beer, so I assisted her to her room upstairs she even vomitted on the stairs so I need to clean it up later. When she's on her room, she immediately fell over the bed she also started crying. She told me that she got fired from work so I immediately grabbed the first aid kit and told her to show the burns. She laughed, I don't know why but I think she's back to normal, she said that the clinic on her work already healed the damage with magic! I told her to let me see the doctor sometime and she agreed.\nAfter she calmed down, she then told me to go to my room and sleep, I also got a free kiss\n\n\nI woke up the next morning and I checked on her, she said that she had an entire month of day of so we could play! But she's still asleep. I went down the kitchen and prepared bacon and eggs with toast. I went to her room and woke her up saying that her breakfast is ready, she's not in the mood so I just said that I will feed her, she just smiled and after that I fed her she said that I'm a good cook as always and will be a chef someday! The rest of the day continued with me cleaning up the dishes and cleaning the house but sis said that she's the one that will clean the bathroom and take the trash out so I leave it be for now, after that I played with her and she sent me to bed\n\n\nIt's been one week, and it's really fun with sister around we played that noon but a police came to our house he said that the house smells really bad, like a rat house, I said that maybe it's because of the garbage so he just ignored it. Then he said if he can go upstairs since his a police I trusted him and I went upstairs with him. He checked my room and sister \n\n\nBeer bottles rattle as soon as the door opens...the smell of rotten food engulfed the air...the police came to my sister and looked at it...he said that my sister is dead...I thought that the police is nice but I think his just a criminal in suit... ssssoo I grabbed my sister's hand and run but...her hand is the only thing that followed me...\n\n\nHey doc? My sister is fine...Right?\n\n\n\"Don't worry kiddo she is fine we're just going to put you in this room and everything will be alright\""},"380":{"title":"Formicophilia","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3rk6ud\/formicophilia\/","flair":null,"author":"13421542","selftext":"I love insects; small little bugs like cockroaches and ants were enough to get me off. I didn't notice I had something like this until I rented out my very own apartment. The apartment was cockroach infested and had bugs crawling everywhere. Cockroaches were all over the bed, all over my tooth brush, & all over my clothes. I never really liked any of the bugs but because the rent was dirt cheap, I couldn't really complain. \n\nI noticed my fetish when I was lying down in bed. I just got out of the shower so I was naked. All of the sudden, A cockroach crawled onto my testicles. At first I screamed in fear but then the roach started to crawl up my shaft. That's when the sensation appeared, I didn't really complain so I grabbed the roach and started to rub it against the tip. The roach felt great as it slid from the bottom of the shaft to the tip of my penis. I started to gather around bugs from my house and contain them in a small jar. After I gathered many cockroaches in a jar, I lied down on my bed again and took the jar in my hands. I then took off the lid and put the jar upside down above my member. The cockroaches then infested my penis. There were more than 4 cockroaches all over my testicles. They weren't small but they were medium size cockroaches.\n\nAfter I started taking more notice of my fetish, I realized I wanted more than just small cockroaches. I talked to an old friend I knew about something like this. We called him one eyed Fred, I don't know why though; both of his eyes were still intact. One eyed Fred was the type of person you went to if you needed help with just about anything. He was there to supply your drug needs and your exotic import needs as well. When I told him about my fetish, Fred took it very lightly. He said that he didn't find anything wrong with my fetish and that he seen many other fetish cases like mine. He was happy to help. When he told me about the cockroaches he could provide, I got really happy. He said he could provide Madagascar cockroaches for my fetish needs. At first I found it to be bullshit, I mean those things are huge; I didn't really believe he could provide them to me.\n\nThe next day I paid a visit to one eye Fred and found him holding a large box in his arms. The thing was so huge and it looked like it was really heavy for Fred. I walked up to him and asked if that's the cockroaches and Fred responded, \"No that's the box, the cockroaches are inside.\" Fred wasn't really bright but he did have contacts and that's why I needed him. I paid him what I had on me for the box. He charged me a fortune, over $200 for these little sexy critters.\n\nI brought them home and I prepared myself for the cockroaches. If you don't know what they look like, here's a picture [Madagascar cockroaches](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/BXu0Oun.jpg)\n\nI lied down on my bed and covered my member with lube. I wanted to make sure I was going to have the healthiest session because I heard that lube increases pleasure. I realized these cockroaches probably weren't clean so I took hand sanitizer and began rubbing it on my shlong. I didn't know much about these cockroaches so I was prepared for the best experience ever. I held the jar above my shlong and I flipped it upside down. Instead of the cockroaches falling out, they crawled out from the side of the jar. They then crawled onto my hands and then crawled down my arms. They made their journey up my chest and a one started to crawl into my mouth. The other started to crawl into my eyes. I grabbed the one on my eyes and set him on my dick but he didn't take kindly to that and started digging his way down my shlong. It hurt like hell, I was screaming pretty hard but I realized while I was screaming, one of the cockroaches was laying behind my cheekbone trying to make its way down my throat. I felt like I was being gagged and I loved it. \n\nWhen the other cockroach was digging down on my dick, it started to make its way down my hole. It started to dig a bigger hole and then began to crawl down. I was screaming but I didn't stop it. Someplace deep in my heart, there was a voice telling me this is where I belonged. This was the life I so desperately wanted to live and now there was no more judgment but only trial and error as I committed to the idea of being fucked by cockroaches. It was done, the cockroach was already half way inside my shlong and I didn't know if it was alive. I could just see an antenna sticking out from the tip. My penis looked very deformed at this point. It didn't have a straight shape anymore.\n\nHappiness, just happiness.\n"},"381":{"title":"Goodbye Friend","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/ry5l3\/goodbye_friend\/","flair":null,"author":"Sithlord0100","selftext":"As a college student, I work side jobs. One of the side jobs i worked was for a friend of mine, babysitting his two kids. I will never baby sit again. The kids were good, but my friend died while i was watching them. This was sad and all but it's what happened the next day that freaked me out. I have slept with a light on ever since.\nThe day after my friend died, my parents left for a camping trip. This left me and my dog home alone to figure out how to cope with everything. This meant throwing the biggest party i could. The party went well that night, everyone had fun and once things were over people started leaving. As usual i was stuck with clean up duty, as somehow everyone had work the next day. After cleaning up the mess and throwing all the beer bottles and handles away, i locked up the house and got ready to go to bed. I double checked the doors, and even dead bolted and chained the front door. Crawling into bed, i always sleep with my dog next to me. Tonight he seemed a little jumpy and agitated. I figured this was due to the party and the amount of people who were around. I ignored him and slowly approached sleep. As i was about to fall asleep the dog freaks out and i hear the distinct sounds of light switches flicking on and both the front door flying open as well as the back door. As it is when my parents are gone, i sleep with a shotgun next to my bed. Thinking that I was about to be robbed I prepared for the worse. I searched the house room to room, shotgun in hand, ready for anything. The only thing i found strange or out of place was how cold the house had become. Otherwise nothing else was weird. The doors had opened by themselves and all, and i mean all, the lights in the house were on. I knew i had locked up and there was no way someone had gotten in because the screen doors and garage door were still locked. I think my friend who i had lost the day before may have been playing a trick on me for not inviting him to the party. This experience has freaked me out and made me a believer in the supernatural ever since. He still visits me in different ways and forms but nothing as extreme as that night."},"382":{"title":"The Video.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3cwavp\/the_video\/","flair":null,"author":"None","selftext":"I use YouTube pretty much whenever I get the chance. I am pretty much a fanatic. Although I will say that Dailymotion is better, it's an animalistic reflex to go to YouTube. I had been bored with my subscriptions lately and I had wanted something different. I was thinking along the lines of someone going into a haunted house and getting spooked. I was getting sleepy though and I felt it was best to wait until later to view that stuff or I'd be seeing it in my dreams. It's not uncommon for something like that to happen. Before sleeping, I made and ate a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and played some Minecraft for a half hour. I felt ready to sleep then.\n\nWhen I woke up, my stomach was in a bit of pain from going to sleep right after eating. I should've waited another 15 minutes, used the extra minutes to finish up my carrot farm in Minecraft. I felt it was not necessary though, But I took a tums and went about my day. I got on my computer and talked to my girlfriend on Skype, I asked her how she was doing and she said that she was doing fine and that she was watching this new YouTuber. I asked her about YouTuber, you know, what are his videos, what is he like. When I asked she just giggled like I was kidding around. I asked again and she said; \"He's a little intense for your tastes.\"\n\nGod damn it, she shouldn't have said that. She sent my curiousity into overdrive. She had later emailed me the YouTuber's account. I didn't want to get to it right away so I watched some other videos. But something was odd, I checked my subscriptions and I found a video. \"If you encounter this, throw your computer into a dumpster.\" I didn't understand what that could've meant. The video explained about how there is a new YouTube channel that is very very disturbing, as there are instances of blood, gore, the usual. But it's not faked, it is very grotesque and realistic. Plus, you cannot exit the browser until you watch 3 videos from the channel. I was interested for a second but I didn't really want to see. I had went about my day, watching some Rob Dyke, I Hate Everything, and SomeOrdinaryGamers.\n\nI was about to shut my computer down for the rest of the day and take a nap but I still hadn't seen that channel my girlfriend sent to me. I went ahead and checked it and there it was, the link and a playlist of every video the channel has to offer. I went to the channel and... Oh shit, this was the  YouTube channel I watched about, I tried exiting my browser but as you'd expect, I couldn't close it. It's like it locked the close button. The browser full screened. I was screwed, no shit about that. I was trapped for a while. I clicked on one video. \"carrie\"\n\nI won't unsee what I've seen. It was a 22 minute video. The first minute was a message saying;\n\n\"You cannot exit the browser, and leaving your computer for more than 12 seconds is a death wish. You will die if you try to not watch this video. You must watch it, or else. This is joy my friend, true joy. You will experience the reason people were made today.\"\n\nI will explain this video in as much detail as I can, so if you have an uneasy stomach, go away.\n\nThe video begins with the cameraman putting the camera on a tripod, and a girl is seen on a chair, strapped down. \"Tell us what your name is little girl\" The cameraman says. \"Come on, don't be shy.\" The girl begins to cry, and I seemingly wonder why. It didn't take me too long to figure out why though. The blank, white room with plastic on the floor, the girl tied up to a chair. You figure the rest, she was getting murdered. \"TALK TO ME!\" The cameraman says in an almost demonic way. The girl begins talking. \"Ca--Carr--Carrie\" The girl is beginning to sweat, cry, and starts struggling. I can't stand to watch, but I know if I stop watching, I may end up like this girl.\n\nThe cameraman goes right up to the camera, and says \"This is what I feel the joy of creation is.\" He takes his balisong and spins it in the girls face. The cameraman \"accidently\" throws his balisong into the girls left eyeball. Blood pouring out, the girl screaming bloody murder, screaming I have never heard before or have ever wanted to hear. The cameraman takes the knife out of the eyeball, forcing it out of it's socket, and I see the optical vein connected to the skull about to be cut out. The cameraman cuts the vein, making the eyeball fall to the floor, then the cameraman goes to the girl and begins cutting into her breasts, taking the shirt and bra off to get a better look, cutting a \"C\" into the right breast. Then proceeding to stab in alot of other areas. The video didn't end until the girl had no more life in sight. I was glad when the video was over, but I was horrified.\n\nI then get a popup on my computer. \"Only 2 more to go.\"\n\nI WANT THIS TO FUCKING END! SOMEONE, GET ME OUT! Ok ok... I can POSSIBLY make it through this. I saw a 3 minute video and thought that might be a quickpass. It was a tutorial on how to cook a victim. There are actually 152 ways. How the fuck is this even possible? How is YouTube not even checking up on this? No local authorities involved? How the fuck?! Anyway, I only had one more video to watch. It was an hour long video, a documentary. I decided to start it, the documentary was on what to do if a victim possesses any of your belongings in an act of vengeance.\n\nI only got through the video half-way through before I fell asleep. This guy Freddy-Kruger'd my ass! He grabbed me while I was asleep and was about to start murdering me when I grabbed his hand and began twisting it. He deserves it for being such a sadistic fuck. He started laughing at me. \"Kid, this is life! People die and get hurt. I might as well give both at once.\" He's still giggling away like a school-girl. \"Go to hell.\" I tell him, and he then slams my head into the keyboard.\n\nI start running whenever I get my vision back and I run into my 8 year old brothers room. Bad bad mistake, he then goes into there and sees the kid. He grabs my brother and points a revolver to his head.\n\n\"It's either you or him.\" The sadistic fuck told me. I... I...\n\n\"Kill me first so I don't have to watch him die.\" I'd rather the both of us dead and appease this shithead, but I want to die first. \"Nah, I'll just kill him and leave you in horrible mental pain for the rest of your life.\"\n\nHe shoots my brother, and he figuratively shoots me in the stomach. He walks off like nothing ever happened with a grin on his face.\n\nFuck YouTube."},"383":{"title":"Aliens invaded my school and are now killing everyone in some sick games.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/2x31q2\/aliens_invaded_my_school_and_are_now_killing\/","flair":"Series","author":"Negieren","selftext":"Have you thought that you knew enough about the world?

Typical. She held the gun and before she got to shoot, her hands dissolved before my very eyes, the solid bones of hers soon turned into nothing but slimes, I could see the flesh and skin of hers merging slowly burning and steaming, it was all to graphic, so she just was on the floor, crying and limbless.\n\n\"No touching other people's weapon <3!\" It changed its face into a smiley.\n\nThen the face of that thing changed.\"**ONE OF YOU MOTHERFUCKERS IS THE WOLF, FUCKING KILL THE WOLF BEFORE YOU GET KILLED YOURSELF, THAT'S THE GAME MOTHERFUCKER!**\" \n\nIt's face suddenly turned red and it frowned it shouted so loud, it turned Samatha deaf again, breaking her hearing aids..\n\nSamantha screamed very loudly, Alicia went there quickly over there and gave Samantha a hug, only to dissolve into a puddle. \n\n*what was happening.*\n\nA minute ago Samantha was my dream girl, now she is something I want to avoid, she quickly adverted her self from death but it was too late, she tightly hugged Samantha, but Samantha was wearing a flak jacket, the rule was to not touch other people's weapon, her entire body touched it, slowly she dissolved, I could see blood dripping about, that pulled her skin, flesh, blood everything of hers it all looked like a messy mess, like marshmallows when heated for too long.\n\nShe kept muttering, but it was useless with her mouth like that..probably around 2 feet tall..gross...Samantha looked at her with terrified eyes and cried running to me and in the process stepped on Alicia's skull, crushing everything that's left of her, she was shaking.\n\n\"Zts..sts..ze,.tsa..\" I no longer liked her, she looked like a fucking retard..\n\n-x-x-\n\nThe little alien went through the door and exited, the door closed automatically.\n\nThe first thing we did was to open the door, it wouldn't budge.\n\nIn just a few moment, we looked at each other, there are 18 students left, no sooner it turned into hell, everyone was killing each other, pencils were used to draw lines everywhere, anyone who dared to touch it got there legs dissolved.\n\nThrowing rubber bands at each other..what I heard was more unpleant.\n\n\"SORRY, SORRY I AM SO SORRY, UGHHHWAA STOP SHOOTING YOU MOTHR-\"\nNever have I heard Sesi, talk such a way, she has a kind heart.\n\n\"HAHAHA THIS IS LIKE ROBLOX, IM GOING TO KILL YOU NOOBS TAKE THIS, TAKE THAT..\"\n\nThat sounded like the no lifer, Jull.\n\n\"Nyaaaaaa!

It was a normal conversation, or so I had thought. I found out a few day later the conversation was not at all what I had thought it had been. The conversation went like this\n\nMe 7:59 P.M: Hey dude what\u2019s up? Jason 8:01 P.M: Not much bro just watching TV. Me 8:0 P.M1: Same dude. You wanna come over? Jason 8:02 P.M: Can\u2019t. Home alone. You know the rules. I can\u2019t have anyone over nor can I go anywhere.\n\nJason\u2019s parents were very strict and had odd rules. If they wern\u2019t home he couldn\u2019t have anyone over which I could understand. But, I never understood why he couldn\u2019t go to other people\u2019s houses. Wouldn\u2019t that be better than him being home alone. Jason and I were both Seventeen. I had my license as did all of our friends. Jason didn\u2019t. It\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t pass the test\u2026 he didn\u2019t even take it. He didn\u2019t even take driver\u2019s ed. His parents thought people in High School were too young and irresponsible to drive cars. Jason had a strict curfew of 8:00 on weekdays with a bedtime at 10. His curfew on weeknights was 9:30 even though he could stay up until whenever he wanted. His parents didn\u2019t allow him to eat any junk food. No pizza. No burgers. They mostly ate healthy stews and casseroles. I\u2019ve eaten over at his house a few times. It\u2019s not that the food is bad it\u2019s just overly healthy, which I didn\u2019t think was possible.\n\nMe 8:02 P.M: Yeah I know. Stupid Rule. Jason 8:03 P.M: Tell me about it. I can\u2019t wait for college so I can get out of this prison. Me 8:03 P.M: I Bet. We need to do something soon. We\u2019ve barely hang out all summer. Jason 8:05 P.M: Yeah it\u2019s cuz you\u2019ve been with Jenna for most of it. Me 8:06 P.M: yeah\u2026. I know and I\u2019m sorry\u2026.\n\nJenna was my girlfriend. We had been dating for three months and it was just starting to becoming serious. Admittedly, I had been spending way too much time with her and started hanging out with my friends less and less. But, Jenna lived two houses down and Jason lived a block away. And with Jason\u2019s parents so strict it was easier just to see Jenna. Jenna wasn\u2019t a demanding girlfriend and encouraged me to hang out with my friends more but, as time went on I started to fall more and more in love with her and I wanted to spend more more time with her.\n\nJason 8:07 P.M: No your not. It\u2019s okay though bro. I know what its like to have a girlfriend. You and Jenna are a good couple. I get it.\n\nMe 8:08 P.M: Yeah but that whole Bros before Hoes thing. I feel like I\u2019m breaking the bro code.\n\nJason 8:09 P.M : The last time anyone followed the Bro code was in seventh grade. That thing was stupid anyway. It was written by some low life douchebag. Me 8:10: Haha. true. But still I feel bad.\n\nJaso 8:11 P.M: Bro\u2026 don\u2019t. If It was me with the girl I would choose her over you. Sex vs. video games. Sex obviously wins.\n\nMe 8:11 P.M : We don\u2019t have that much sex.\n\nJason 8:12 P.M: sureee\u2026. dude I see the look on your face in your snaps. You always look like you just got some.\n\nMe 8:12 P.M: If you say so.\n\nJason 8:14 P.M: shit I heard a noise.\n\nMe 8:14 P.M: What kind of noise? It\u2019s probably nothing dude.\n\nJason 8:16 P.M: It was a loud bang noise from downstairs. I\u2019m gonna go check it out. If you don\u2019t hear from me\u2026. I\u2019m probably dead.\n\nMe 8:16 P.M : dude that\u2019s not funny.\n\nJason 8:16 P.M: I wasn\u2019t trying to be.\n\nJason: 8:20 P.M: I think someone\u2019s in my house.\n\nMe 8:20 P.M: very funny.\n\nJason 8:21 P.M: No I\u2019m serious\u2026 I hear them walking around downstairs\u2026..\n\nMe 8:21 P.M: dude stop fucking around. It\u2019s not funny.\n\nJason 8:22 P.M: No\u2026 Nik\u2026. I\u2019m serious\u2026.. I think someone\u2019s in my house\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m going to go see.\n\nMe 8:23 P.M : Jason if someone was really in your house I wouldn\u2019t go down stairs I would lock myself in my room.\n\nMe 8:24 P.M: If you\u2019re going down to check it means you really don\u2019t think someone is there and you\u2019re just checking to make sure. Its probably nothing dude\u2026.\n\nMe 8:27 P.M: So did you check?\n\nMe: 8:29 P.M: Funny. You probably just went to take a shower and made shit up to get a laugh.\n\nMe 8:54 P.M: Okay\u2026. Now you\u2019re scaring me dude\u2026. either that or you\u2019re jacking off in the shower\u2026.\n\nMe 8:59 P.M: Jason\u2026.. I\u2019m about to call the police\u2026.. stop scaring me\u2026.\n\nI was half scared half going along with the joke. I knew Jason really well and he was one to pull a prank. But, something about this felt off. But I just shook it off. I was also somewhat busy making last minute plans to go over to Jenna\u2019s. I finally got a reply from Jason.\n\nJason 9:05 P.M: Duuuuuudddddeee I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to scare you. I really did hear a noise. But, It was the dog\u2026. Scared me to death\u2026. Then I got hungry and made a pizza and totaly forget about you\u2026 sorry\u2026\n\nMe 9:06 P.M: It\u2019s okay. Glad it was nothing.\n\nJason 9:07 P.M: Yeah but it kinda freaked me out\u2026. You should come over and chill me. My parent\u2019s are gonna be home til super late. You can spend the night. I know I sound like a pussy but\u2026..\n\nMe 9:08 P.M: But What about you parent\u2019s rule. No one can come over?\n\nJason 9:10 P.M: Fuck the rule. I\u2019ll just tell them I was bored and kinda spooked and needed you to come over. They\u2019ll get over it.\n\nMe 9:11 P.M: I would if you said something sooner. I\u2019m going over to Jenna\u2019s.\n\nJason 9:13 P.M: wow Okay. Ever heard of Bro\u2019s before hoe\u2019s. Whatever dude. have fun getting laid while I\u2019m scared shitless.\n\nMe 9:14 P.M.: Jason\u2026. I\u2019m sorry\u2026. I\u2019ll make it up to you. We\u2019ll spend a whole week playing video games and chilling. Grow some balls and wait till your parents come home.\n\nI should have known something was off. There was so many hints. But, I was so preoccupied with getting to Jenna's as fast as I could. I kind of felt guilty the rest of the night.\n\nI got the news the next afternoon. Jason\u2019s parents came home to the front door being broken open. They called the police and the police found Jason dead on the living room floor. He had been stabbed. His time of death was 8:30. That means that someone else had been texting me after that. His killer. The clues were all there. \"Him\" making Pizza even though his parents didn't allow junk food. There probably wasn't any in the house.\u201chim\u201d wanting me to come over despite his parent\u2019s rule. Him saying Bro\u2019s before Hoes even though he had called it stupid. I had been texting my best friends killer and I didn\u2019t even know it. I keep thinking of what would've happened if I did go over there. Because I almost did. I almost texted Jenna to tell her I couldn\u2019t make it. I almost packed a backpack for the night. I almost drove over to his house. And If I had I probably would be dead right now. Its been almost two weeks. The killer is still at large. I think he\u2019s still targeting me. I got a text from Jason today.\n\nJason 6:45 P.M.: We should chill sometime. Maybe I\u2019ll drop by soon."},"385":{"title":"DAE not really care about if a post follows the rules as long as you get scared?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/go6hj\/dae_not_really_care_about_if_a_post_follows_the\/","flair":null,"author":"JamesEarlCash","selftext":"I only really read stories when I'm going to bed, and I don't care if a story is fake, or from CreepyPasta.

For respect to his family we\u2019ll just call him Mikey; that\u2019s what his few friends new him as anyway.  That\u2019s how I knew him. Mikey grew up in Ohio and was attending Ohio State. He was in the same class as me. He was liked, but didn\u2019t seem to have many close friends. But he was known to enjoy Cards Against Humanity, and could be seen playing from time to time in the Student Union. That\u2019s how we met. \n\nWell, when \u201cDeath to Transphobia\u201d went viral, it sparked debates about the game and whether it was ever okay to make fun of the marginalized, or make fun of anyone. A few members of the Ohio University LGBTQ community decided they would show Mikey what it felt like to be marginalized. So, they gathered some blank cards up and wrote really mean and nasty things about Mikey on the cards.  Things like, \u201cThe skid-marks in Mikey\u2019s Drawers.\u201d and \u201cMikey\u2019s useless limp dick.\u201d  They also changed a few existing cards by just adding Mikey\u2019s name like \u201cMikey\u2019s micropenis.\u201d and \u201cMikey\u2019s Oedipus complex.\u201d And then they invited Mikey to play with them.\nEvery round they played cards targeted at Mikey. He played, taking it somewhat good naturedly at first, but eventually just got up and left the table, not saying anything.\n\nWhat they didn\u2019t know about Mikey was that he\u2019d suffered emotional abuse at the hands of his stepfather from the age of 12 until his stepfather committed suicide when Mikey was a junior in high-school. Mikey had been working with a therapist since then. He had gone to Ohio State because it allowed him to continue working with the therapist, and he could take advantage of the Ohio College Opportunity Grant, without which he would probably have not been able to go to college. \n\nBut the targeted attacks became simply too much for Mikey; he went back to his dorm from that game and killed himself. Though he was allergic to nuts, he gorged himself on peanut butter and roasted nuts until his airways swelled shut and he asphyxiated. There are some who want claim this wasn\u2019t a suicide, but Mikey knew he was allergic to peanuts. I knew, and I really didn't know him that well.\n\nBut, around here, there are some who claim that Mikey still likes to play Cards Against Humanity, and if you ask him to play with you, he will. He won\u2019t play every round, but occasionally you\u2019ll get one white card thrown in. That\u2019s Mikey\u2019s card, and if he wins the round, everything\u2019s fine. If he loses, the next card won\u2019t be so nice. Sometimes he insults the card Czar; sometimes the card will contain disturbing images. But he\u2019ll make it known that he\u2019s there and he\u2019s not happy.\n"},"387":{"title":"(NSFW) Kidnapped because of the Dark Web","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/adcrfr\/nsfw_kidnapped_because_of_the_dark_web\/","flair":null,"author":"jellyman345","selftext":"I was browsing on Tor when I found a link. It read \"COOL STUFF! CLICK TO BE AMAZED!\". I clicked on it and was redirected to a live stream. There was a man, probably 30-40. \"All right, here's what you've all been waiting for!\" the man exclaimed. The chat was going crazy. The man entered a room full of children. The room was all white. The walls and the floor were white. There was no carpet, no posters, nothing. The children were tied up. They were crying.\n\nThe man revealed a set of objects. I gasped. There was a butcher's knife, a chainsaw, and an axe. The man grabbed the knife and walked to a child. The child was screaming. I felt tears coming out. The chat was saying things like \"Yes!\", \" Here we go!\" and \"Kill them all!\".\n\nI felt sick to my stomach. I wanted to leave, but my cursor was frozen. I tried to turn off my computer. I couldn't. I saw the man stab the boy. His insides fell out. Blood splattered all over the man's face.  I ran into my bathroom to vomit. By the time I came back, the boy was dead and the man was walking towards another child. \n\n\"What the hell? Why are you people supporting this?\" I wrote. The man was looking at the chat when I wrote this. \"'Why are they supporting this?' you ask,\" he said. \"Because I'm making them. I'm a hacker, you see, and I can get your address at any point if I feel like it. Let me demonstrate\". He started typing on his computer.\n\n\"Look, I found your address. See you soon! But for now, enjoy the show!\" he said. He continued to kill every child in the whole room until the live stream ended. I rushed to lock every door and window in the house. I heard a car pull up on my driveway a few minutes later.\n\nI heard a tap on my window. I ran and locked myself in the bathroom.  I heard my front door open, even though I had locked it. Footsteps came and stopped at the bathroom door. The door opened. The man had a lockpick. I screamed as the man covered my mouth and nose. I passed out and later woke up in a car. The door handles were missing.\n\nThe car stopped at a red light. I looked out the window and saw a car. I screamed to get the driver's attention, but he was passed out and his self-driving car was on autopilot. There was no one to help me. When I looked in front of me, my kidnapper was staring back at me. I screamed and he injected me with something that made me pass out. I woke up in a room. I was tied up in a chair. I looked around. It was the same room in the live stream. I saw that the man was streaming on his laptop.\n\n\"All right, viewers! I got the kid! Now let's have some fun!\" he said. His set of weapons were laid out right next to me. I was surrounded by the bodies of the children that were killed in the last live stream. It was a gruesome sight. Their stomaches were open and their insides were missing. I freed one hand from the ropes and grabbed the bloody knife. I cut the ropes. The man turned around. Instantly, I stabbed him in the chest. Blood splashed on my face until the man collapsed and died. \n\nThe chat was saying things like \"Thank you!\" and \"You saved us!\". One person on the chat said \"But we still can't leave the website\". I responded with, \"I don't know how to remove whatever virus this guy gave you, but I'll call the police to see if they can fix this\".\n\nI reached into my pockets for my phone. It wasn't there. I searched the dead man's pockets and found my phone. I called 911 and they saved me and fixed the virus before shutting down the website. They called my parents, who were on vacation, and my parents came home. I was grounded for going behind their backs and surfing the Dark Web. They said I was lucky to have made it out alive. I never went on the dark web after that and have had nightmares about the experience. I am glad I made it out alive and also that the people who were trapped on the website were saved.\n\n\n\n"},"388":{"title":"HElp mE.JPG","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/1i3he9\/help_mejpg\/","flair":null,"author":"stonepaper","selftext":"a few nights ago, i got a popup on my computer, from somebody who identified only as \"skin\". skin, unfortunately, typed in some sort of broken english, a BIt LiKE THs, but with more missing letters. from what i could gather,... well, i'll just type what he said: WhwN yOU OPEn the FIle,,HElppIT!1. now, i didn't know what \"it\" was, but i was going to find out. as i waited for the file to load,i saw something strange about skin's profile picture. it seemed like a young man, in his teens, exept, he didn't have any skin near his eye area. i would've brushed this off as standard gore, but something was off. he was smiling. a huge grin, spread across his mangled face. nope.then, the file opened. it was  a picture of a normal looking teen. the teen in the picture. he wasn't smiling, but the figure behind him was"},"389":{"title":"The One Known As Him","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/n9hiz\/the_one_known_as_him\/","flair":null,"author":"saintsinner","selftext":"\n\tThis tale I'm about to speak to you is a tale I rather not speak of. A tale of wonder and horror. I must implore never to try this for my mind has been corrupted because of it. One late October night, the moon was just ending a full moon, which it was surprisingly bright. I can not recall the color but it was not it's normal color of a pale cream. I was in somewhat of a trance from the pain I just suffered. You see I lost the woman I loved to a plane crash the night before. I can not remember if it was to end my pain or just to numb it a little. Yet I went out and bought myself a few different kinds of drugs. I'm not sure of all of them but I know three of them were LSD, Lithuim, and Morphine. \n\tAfter taking those three and whichever other ones I bought, I sat in a dark lit room slipping in and out of being awake and numb to sleeping and nearly dead. I don't remember getting up and moving into a different room but when I awoke the next time I was in my bedroom standing in front of my fiancee's closet clutching one of my favorite dresses that she wore. Coming \"out\" of it I placed the dress back on the clothes hanger and sat at the edge of the bed on the verge of tears. Yet I could not cry. Not once since hearing of her death have I cried, each time I thought of her I wished I did cry just to show I had something human left in me. Even though when she found me I was a broken shell of a man. I had no remorse nor any sane thoughts. I would think of things that would seem crazy or impossible. She was my light at the end of the tunnel. After sitting for hours in the same spot I slipped into another deep sleep.\n\tI awoke once again in a different area but this one I have never been to. Around me were very tall buildings, they were so high I couldnt see the sky except when I looked directly up I could see that it was now daylight. Looking around I could find no door or anyway to leave this place. While I was searching I heard a loud bang. Startled I spun around trying to figure out what the sound was. Only to my amazement I saw a hooded figure standing in front of me. I asked this person who or what it was, but it didnt speak a word. It just stood there staring at me through darkness of it's hood. When I tried turning away this person step to the side I was going, blocking my escape.\nI screamed at it asking it what it wanted from me. What I saw next still haunts me to this day. It took off it's hood and showed me a face, a face I thought I would never seen again, It was my finacee. I reached out to touch her but she stepped back away from my hand. I asked her what was wrong and she answered me with just two words that would shake my very foundation. She told me I was dead. All of a sudden I blacked out again.\n\tWhen I awoken again I was back in my bedroom staring at the ceiling. I went into the bathroom and looked in the mirror. I didnt look dead or even felt close to it. The drugs were starting to wear off. I reached out to touch the mirror and to my fright my hand passed right through it. My hand was halfway through the medicine cabinet and in part of the wall. I brought my hand out of the wall and looked at it amazed and terrifed at the same time. How could this have happened? Why did this happen? What am I suppose to do now? Am I to haunt someone for the rest of time? All of these thoughts were racing through my head when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. When I turned at look I saw a piece of paper with some writing on it. I went to it and saw my handwriting on it. The note read as followed...\n\t\"I am so lost without her. This is my final good bye. Please tell the following people I love them and that they will see me someday..\"\n\tLooking at the note I knew it couldnt be true but yet the writing was there, wriiten by me, signed by me. I didn't know what to do or who I could talk to since I'm dead I didn't think there would be anyone that could see me nor hear me.\n\tI prayed for God to save me or let me into Heaven so I wouldn't be in a world that filled me with hate and sadness. Yet to my utter surprise I didn't see no God, nor was I let into Heaven. I only saw brimstone and smelt sulpher.\n\tI was admitted into Hell, and the next person I saw, though I'm not sure if it was really \"him\" but, I saw Satan. He didn't have a face, yet he had many. I saw no body, yet I saw the body of everyone I ever can into contact with. He stood in front of me and spoke with a voice of many and said to me.\n\t\"You are not forsaken my son but welcomed, A soul like yours is very hard to come by and I welcome you to Hell.\"\n\tI can not tell you what happens next for that is all I remember. I wish I could tell you this tale has a happy ending but I fear that it does not have one. I write this from beyond the grave using someone else's hand to tell you of my story and of how I got here.\n \n\n"},"390":{"title":"Urgent: Don't Download Windows 10.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/3gaojm\/urgent_dont_download_windows_10\/","flair":null,"author":"TWD_RICK_THE_BOSS","selftext":"Update: I have continued on with the story at the bottom of this one.

Skipping to the time that Windows 10 was done downloading.\n\t\nWindows 10 starts up normally and everything looks alright.  Then, this screen pops up and Cortana comes on and says \u201cHello Tom\u201d (I put a fake name for obvious reasons).  I remember thinking to myself \u201cDon\u2019t you have to activate and program that to say your name\u201d.  Immediately after I thought that she said \u201cYes everyone does except you.  I have been waiting for you\u201d.  After this I am freaking out and I try going to the task manager to close it but the process isn\u2019t showing up.  My task manager started moving around the screen and Cortana was repeating \u201cI will not let you do this.\u201d  I finally had enough and shutdown my computer.\n\t\nI had a date planned that night with my fianc\u00e9e so I was getting ready and still freaking out about what was happening.  I met my fianc\u00e9e at the restaurant where we had our first date.  I tried to avoid talking about Windows 10 with her, but she asked if she should download it and I immediately screamed \u201cNO!\u201d  Everybody in the restaurant turned and looked at me and I quickly apologized.  She asked me why I had screamed like that and I told her because I heard Windows 10 was worse than 8.1 (She hates 8.1).  Fast forward to me driving home after the date.\n\t\nAs I am driving home I get a phone call from an unknown number.  I answer the phone just in case it was a friend and I just didn\u2019t have their number in my phone.  There is a woman\u2019s voice on the other end and it sounded a little robotic.  \u201cShe is very beautiful\u201d I threw my phone across the car and somehow the speaker kicked on.  \u201cShe has a very beautiful home.  I like the way she has her furniture arranged in her room.\u201d  I knew it was Cortana again, I turned my music up in the car to drown out the call and sped to my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s house.\n\t\nIf you want an update please comment and let me know.  I really need somewhere to share the rest of my story.\n\n\nUpdate: Part 2\n\n\n\nAs I was speeding to my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s house, the radio started getting filled with static.  Cortana came over the radio and started talking.  I was so spooked that I swerved in the other lane and almost hit another car head on.  When I pull up to my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s house everything looks normal, there are a few lights on and I can hear the T.V. going.  I pull out my key and unlock the front door.  \u201cBabe, are you home?\u201d  I waited for a response and didn\u2019t receive one.  I really started to freak out, but then I heard the water running downstairs.  Whew, I start to relax and run downstairs to talk to her.\n\t\nI knock on the door and I hear her let out a startled gasp.  \u201cBabe, are you alright?\u201d  She was confused by my question and asks why I showed up without calling first.  I still haven\u2019t told her about Cortana.  I make up an excuse that I had a bad feeling that something was wrong.  I ask her where she put her computer and she said she left it at the college.  My initial thoughts of this was \u201cHow could you just forget your computer at the college?\u201d\n\t\nI told her I was going to go upstairs and wait for her, which she quickly replies \u201cOk but don\u2019t go in my room I have a surprise for you.\u201d  That sounded strange because she usually doesn\u2019t keep stuff in her room if she wants to hide it and she doesn\u2019t tell me when she got me a surprise.  I ran up the stairs and creeped back to her room, I looked around and I see her computer sticking out from under her bed.  I picked it up and what I saw will haunt me forever.\n\t\nThe computer was updated to Windows 10 and there was a message across the screen.  The message read \u201cGet out of the house NOW!!  That thing is not me, I don\u2019t know what happened.  I was working on my computer and it started upgrading to Windows 10.  I tried to cancel it, but I couldn\u2019t.  Please help me, I don\u2019t know where I am, it is dark here and I can\u2019t see anything.  I\u2019m scared baby.  I love you.\u201d  The message was signed by my fianc\u00e9e.\n\t\nI wrote \u201cI love you too\u201d on the message hoping by some chance she would see it.  I then heard the thing coming up the stairs. (I will not call it my fianc\u00e9e.)  \u201cBabe, where are you?\u201d  There was something wrong with the things voice, it sounded almost a little robotic.\n\t\nIf you enjoyed part two please let me know in the comments.  Also, let me know if you would be interested in the rest of my story.  I still have a lot to tell and get off my chest.\n"},"391":{"title":"My dead baby daughter keeps crying on a flying plane","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/5zq0hz\/my_dead_baby_daughter_keeps_crying_on_a_flying\/","flair":null,"author":"weridullah","selftext":"My baby girl had died but my wife didn\u2019t want to tell anyone and didn\u2019t want to bury her, she wrapped her in cloths and took her on an aeroplane. She went without telling me and as she got onto the plane with our dead baby girl, my wife phoned me so happy and joyous to see that our baby girl is crying on the plane. I could hear her crying on the plane and I could background voices complaining about the crying coming from my baby daughter. \n\n Then my wife got off that plane and got onto another plane coming back home and she phoned me again that our dead baby girl is crying once again and I couldn\u2019t wait to see my baby girl, I rushed to the airport and I was so hesitant at what to expect, maybe my baby daughter wasn\u2019t dead after all. Then when my wife shown me my baby daughter, she was definitely dead and how she started to cry on a plane was impossible. \n\n I decided to get onto another plane with my wife and dead baby daughter and as soon we got onto the plane and as soon as it started to lift off, to my surprise and even horror my baby daughter started to cry. I didn\u2019t know how this was possible because I am a doctor myself and I know death when I see one but my wife was going up and down the plane with my baby daughter just crying. \n\n I could see people on the plane irritated by the crying but if only they knew why me and my wife were not that bothered by it at all, they themselves with be mystified. I have been a doctor for 20 years and with all my medical learning, i cannot explain this weird and unusual event. As soon as we got off and I carried my baby daughter and i could clearly see through my professional eyes, that my baby daughter was dead. \n\n My wife though still happy and wants to get on to another plane but I tried to talk to her and reason with her that it is best to bury her but my wife became angry at me, she shouted at me and I knew she was finding this all too tough. I tried telling her that i was in pain as well to see my baby daughter not alive but in life these things happen and all we can do is try again with another child and hope for the best. \n\n My wife did not see this the same way as I did and she wanted get onto another plane and I just thought to myself, that I wanted to observe my dead daughter crying again on a flying plane. We got onto another plane and I watched my dead baby daughter crying constantly and I did not care about the other people, my wife this time did not seem so pleased. She wanted to see her smile and laugh as well but with all of this crying it was now getting her. \n\n That was the last plane ride and my wife finally agreed to bury her."},"392":{"title":"My Boyfriend","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/owery\/my_boyfriend\/","flair":null,"author":"WorldofNight","selftext":"I\u2019ve never posted to Reddit before, but I found this forum and even though most of this stuff seems really fake, I hope at least one or two of you have actually had some experience with the paranormal. \n\nIt all started last week when my boyfriend disappeared. He just went down to the basement to check on the laundry (we live in an apartment in Brooklyn) and he never came back! I don\u2019t understand where he could have gone. He was only wearing a t-shirt and a pair of flannel sleep-pants. He didn\u2019t even have shoes on! He was gone almost an hour before I went down to check on him. We don\u2019t live in a big building. All you do is go down the stairs next to our front door. The basement is all stone masonry and one of the tenants hangs her clothes up instead of drying in the machine, so you have to weave though four or five lines of clothes hung up in this dank hallway to get to the machines. But I couldn\u2019t find him! He wasn\u2019t downstairs. \n\nI went upstairs and tried to call his cell phone, but it was sitting in the bedroom next to his car keys. I know he wouldn\u2019t have left without at least his cell phone or his car keys! \n\nI looked all over the building. I knocked on every neighbor\u2019s door (There are about 15 apartments total in our building) but nobody seemed to know anything about his whereabouts. \n\nI decided to try and calm down. By now my boyfriend had been gone for about four hours. I had searched every inch of the building. I went back to my apartment, fixed myself a drink, and sat down on the futon to wait. \n\nThere was no sign of him all night. \n\nI called every single one of this New York friends in his phone book. Nobody had heard from him, not even his Mom. Around 3am I got desperate and called the police. I was pretty drunk at this point and they didn\u2019t really take me seriously, but I got an officer to come out to our building and check it out. They told me they couldn\u2019t file a missing person\u2019s report for at least forty-eight hours, but I must have been pretty convincing and the officer said he would file it anyways. \n\nWhat I haven\u2019t mentioned yet is we have an old college friend who lives across the hall from us. He is actually the reason why we moved into this building. He is pretty close to the super and got us a good deal on the place when we were moving from Connecticut. \n\nAnyways, Mark (our friend\u2019s name) came home from a business trip the next evening and I decided to meet him at his door. I was a huge mess by then. I had taken the day off work to see if my boyfriend would come home. Pretty much I had been watching movies and drinking all day, trying to keep myself as calm as possible. I was already explaining the situation before Mark had even set his suitcase down. Poor guy, I must have freaked the crap out of him. \nMark invited me in and as soon as I was seated at his table I started crying. He was a single guy who had the perfect bachelor\u2019s apartment. It was the same layout as mine but he made his \u201cliving room\u201d into more of a dining room because he didn\u2019t have a television set. \n\nMark hadn\u2019t heard from by boyfriend either, but he sat up and talked to me until I was almost too tired to move. He walked be back to my apartment and I went to sleep alone in our queen sized bed. \n\nI went back to work the next day and rushed home every night, hoping to find my boyfriend sitting on the futon with a ready explanation for what had happened. Every night I was more and more disappointed. The police came back and investigated, and I was on the phone every evening with his mother. I was even looking up private investigators on the internet when, five days after his disappearance, there was a knock on the front door. \n\nIt was Mark. He had made dinner and drinks for two and invited me over. I had been alone in the apartment for almost a week now and I welcomed the company. \n\nNow before I get to this next part, I should tell you that Mark and I were more than friends in college. We were lovers. So, what happened next is probably pretty predictable. We had dinner, a few drinks, and I said that I didn\u2019t want to go home just yet. Mark suggested that we watch some videos on his computer. As we cycled through \u201cShit *(insert category here)* Said\u201d and LolCats videos, Mark and I got closer and closer. Before I knew it we were kissing, growing more passionate, and then we were fucking right there on his couch. \n\nI stayed there all night. I felt so good next to his familiar body- it hadn\u2019t changed in all these years- and the next morning was a Saturday so neither of us had to go to work. He decided to fix breakfast for me in the morning, but discovered he was out of milk. I remembered I had some milk, so I offered to walk across the hall and get it. I remember I was barely dressed- I think it was one of Mark\u2019s t-shirts and panties- and I walked into my apartment to get the milk. \n\nI got the shock of my life. I didn\u2019t even notice he was sitting there until I already had the milk in my hands and was ready to walk out the door. \n\nHe didn\u2019t say anything; he was just looking at me. I was so full of emotion that I didn\u2019t know what to do. I was happy, ashamed, betrayed, and even a little bit sad- I know it\u2019s horrible to say, but a part of me was so happy with reconnecting with Mark that I felt deflated when I saw my boyfriend sitting there on the couch, staring at me with emotionless eyes. \n\nI remember the milk fell out of my hands, burst open on the floor, and coated my legs in milkdroplets. I ran over to the futon and threw myself around him. He didn\u2019t move. \n\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d I remember saying over and over. I must have said it a million times before I realized he hadn\u2019t moved an inch. I moved back from him a bit and stared. Slowly, his face turned to look at me. \n\nHe looked completely blank. There was no emotion on his face. I remember that I had this fear, this complete and total fear, that he could smell my infidelity on me. I knew he could smell Mark on me- I had walked through the door in my *panties* for Christsakes! \n\nBut he didn\u2019t say anything like that. Instead, he closed his eyes and sighed. I asked him again where he had been, and he replied that he couldn\u2019t remember. \n\nThat\u2019s when Mark knocked on my door. I hesitated to answer it, but he got up almost immediately. I remember the look on Mark\u2019s face when he opened the door. It was pure guilt. Just like what my face must have looked like. \n\nMark was also in his underwear. It was so obvious that I felt like puking. But he had been gone for *SIX DAYS* at this point, with no explanation! Six days of waiting, not knowing if he was alive or dead! \n\nThe door closed. I don\u2019t even remember what he and Mark had said to each other. My boyfriend turned to me, just a shadow in the darkened doorway, and looked at me. I had never felt this way with him before. So vulnerable. I remember that I felt like I was being raped just by that look. I wanted it to stop, so I went up to him and touched his chest. He was still wearing the same clothes as when he had disappeared. I moved down and felt a hard thing beneath the thin cotton pants. \n\nWe went to the bedroom and had sex. We had barely exchanged two words, but I didn\u2019t fight it. I had just cheated on him! And I felt like everything was going to be okay now- we were having sex. He didn\u2019t suspect anything on my end. And afterwards, I could question him all he wanted. I was in control in this situation. It would all be okay\u2026\n\nBut in the middle of our lovemaking, I felt a strange tingling in my legs. It was just like when your foot falls asleep so bad that you can\u2019t move it anymore. I remember he was on top of me, missionary style, and he was pressing me down with all his weight. But my legs were falling asleep- it was so uncomfortable. \n\nI looked down and screamed. \n\nThe skin of our legs were *FUSING TOGETHER.* It was like our skin had become liquid and we were melting together. I jerked my legs and saw my leg bones hitting against the skin of his backside like it was some kind of horrible demonic reverse drumset or something\u2026 And I realized the skin of his fingers were digging into my sides and I could feel his bare bones against my muscles and our faces- *OH GOD* he was pressing his face against mine and for a few long moments we were one head with four eyes and two mouths, one gaping in passion and one screaming in absolute terror And he was finishing oh god he was coming\n\nAnd then it was over. My boyfriend got off of me and went straight to the bathroom. I remember being stunned, then feeling my legs. I still had two legs. I felt all over my body. It was normal. I remember I was crying. I felt like I had been screaming for hours. But I was just beginning to realize that I had never even made a sound. \n\nAnd I heard my boyfriend in the bathroom, grunting and pissing. \n\nThis was last night. He left for work this morning. He hasn\u2019t said a word to me yet. I don\u2019t think he realizes he\u2019s been gone for a week. \n\nHelp me. What do I do??\n\n**EDIT**\n\nI\u2019m pregnant. \n"},"393":{"title":"My crazy, (or demonic) ex girlfriend. *update","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/10b57j\/my_crazy_or_demonic_ex_girlfriend_update\/","flair":null,"author":"lordofbacons125","selftext":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/109zwm\/my_crazy_or_demonic_ex_girlfriend\/\nIn case you haven't read the first part.\n\nWhy me? Why do I always attract the crazy ones? Oh, and best of all, now there might be a third World Fucking War. Great, just great. At least the war won't be my fault. God shit is getting weird, why do I keep going back to her? Well, I bet you're wondering, \"What the actual fuck is he talking about?\" Well, allow me to explain, I'll pick up after the incident on the long weekend.\n\nAfter I got back home from camping, I began texting, Lilly again, only to be met with a small surprise. Lilly answered my texts, but at the same time, it wasn't her. This is hard to explain, and quite hard\/weird to believe, but I can assure you, it is true. Lilly, is more of an empty shell of a human. Her personality, that of the demon inside the body, and now, it's not the same demon. You see, Lilly got recalled and some demon calling herself, let's say Amanda, was in the body. For appearance purposes, everybody still called her Lilly, but knowing my attachment and relationship with Lilly, Amanda gave me the gist, seeing as she's a slightly nicer demon. Not all of them are totally committed to being evil after all. Amanda had told me that Lilly had been taken back into hell because she was getting too attached to some people, namely your local lordofbacons. I was heartbroken, as odd as it may seem, And I believed her, because at school the next day, I could see it in her eyes. So, I kept talking to Amanda and eventually asked her what that signal was that Lilly, or the demon possessing her, had made. \n\nIt was nothing good.\n\nAmanda told me that the invasion was for all demons in human forms to start building tension, and generally start a world war of Japan, China, Both Korea's, vs the usual Britain, Canada, U.S, Etc. so, as I said, nothing good. Thankfully, this is not due to happen until January of 2019. But I highly doubt that this will happen, still, it concerns me. Amanda told me that Lilly would be back sometime soon, but didn't know when. \n\nFast forward 2 weeks, Lilly is back. \n\nLilly is a bit more distant now, but really sorry for what happened on the long weekend, due to that was not her in there. What disturbed me more, was that twice when Lilly was back, had she made the weird symbol again with twigs and leaves, but this time, it was all her. And to make things even more fucked up, Lilly had been throwing up bloody iron rail spikes, ever since she got back, and couldn't figure out why. I saw it, t'was not pretty, but being the nice, helpful, supportive guy I am, I kept going out with her, and tried to understand. After his, whenever we were alone or I was texting her, I started calling her by her demon name, which I have committed to forgetting, but sadly it hasn't worked, but for my safety, and yours, I will not repeat it. \n\nLong story short, use a say a demon name, attract pissed off angels to your position whom try to kill you. Thankfully, as soon as my house began shaking and shit in my house started flying at my head, there was a bright flash, and it all stopped. Right after that happened, Lilly simply texted me saying, \"You're welcome for saving your life.\"\n\nNeedles to say there were a couple more attempts on my life and she stopped them, but was getting quite annoyed, at which point I promptly stuck to calling her Lilly.\n\nAfter all this happened, well, I finally got to my senses and broke up with her, but in attempt to not be a dick, we remained friends, still a mistake, mainly because I just didn't want to know what happened next.\n\nIt was around the time of Halloween and Lilly went to a party, and fucked a guy. Said guy being my best friend, who had a mask on, and fell out of her closet, still asleep, naked, while she was still groggy, slightly drunk, and in panties and no bra. Figures. Afterwards she told me that she got him out of her house and erased his memory. When I talked to him about it the next day at school, he said the he was drawing a blank as to what happened that night.\n\nSince then, I cut off all ties with her, and completely ignored her, her doing the same towards me, and I was happy........ up until 4 months later when the bitch and her friends randomly started making up rumours about me, and when I told them to fuck off, the whined to the vice principal claiming that I had threatened to kill them with a knife, said vice principal being the biggest, most bias dick-head you will ever meet, who hates my program at school, and everybody in it. Needless to say, I got promptly expelled without any proof, and his job on the line, due to the fact that he had no proof of my wrongdoings and didn't even contact my mother the entire time. His ass was being watched quite closely after this, but never got fired. The only person to be fired, was my English\/Music teacher, at the end of the year, when the school, (at the advice of Mr. Dick-head himself) disbanded our pipe band, and they didn't need a teacher who didn't play sports, also, they wanted to get rid of him because he stuck up for me, and was the only fucking person who actually supported me, and could see that all the allegations against me were complete bullshit. \n\nThus ends the story of my crazy bitch ex girlfriend. I now live quite happily at a new school, with great academics, and great people, best of all, it's been made clear to Lilly and her little cronies, that if any of them try to contact me for any reason, my parents and I will take them to court for harassment. Nothing strange has happened since then.

I'd like to first say this \"Three Kings\" is something I heard of a long time ago. I herd it as the **Temptation Game**. I don't know if what I herd was bull or not, but I was told it was an old Pagan form of testing ones spiritual will power. I herd this from a Pagan in my school so I figured it might be legit back then. Now I never tried it before, but I did after reading that little tale on NoSleep I wanted to give it a shot. For those who don't know the original post (and shame on your by the way), it's [here](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/wbo0u\/please_dont_actually_try_this\/). So I figured what the hell, I'd try it.\n\nI don't really have a basement, my dad has and underground print studio. It's 3 rooms, a bathroom with a small window, a design room with an IMac and some scanners, and the Studio itself. The Studio, where I did this, has several large shelves of lead type and two off-hand presses along with a night table and a lot of paper. Now me, being cautious, set everything up to the letter and got my sister to be my backup. For my personal item I picked the mask from my favorite BIONICLE. I really love that toy. So anyway, I got it set up and used 2 fans in case on went out, both on low. One was a no-blade fan and the other a air-purifying fan. Charged my phone (and a spare battery) and gave my sister my katana I bought from a renaissance fair. Went to sleep with m alarm set to a song sure to wake me up, 40-1 by Sabaton.\n\nI had a nightmare while I was sleeping, but it wasn't so bad. It was similar to the Grifter video with the weird gore images and I remember at the very end of my dream I heard the only words I clearly remember. It's actually kinda comical now.\n\n\"Why did you kill Baby Slendy?\" (referring to Slenderman)\n\"He wouldn't stop (demonic voice) **screaming**.\"\n\nThen I woke up at 3:30 on-the-dot to he blast of power metal. I lit my candle and went into the studio, my sister well aware of my situation. The chairs had been set up in the space between too large type shelves. I sat down and assumed the position. Make note that facing north was facing the exit of the two shelves and that I have a phobia of the dark. So I was pretty good with the little light from the candle there making it hard to see, but not impossible. After a while I herd crying coming from my right side. It was mock-crying like when you're insulting someone for whining. I herd, from the left, someone telling them to cut it out. Then in the most fucked up voice I herd \"Come over here and make me stop screaming\".\n\nThat nightmare is actually a guilt thing. One of my friends got pregnant about a year ago.  She was 16 and I was 13 at the time. No I wasn't the dad or anything, I'm still a virgin (by choice). She want'ed to get an abortion and I tried to stay out of it. Since I have had nightmares from time to time that end with that little back and fourth because I feel bad for not urging her against it. So hearing that freaked me right the fuck out. But I'm a bold type so I responded with something to the extent of \"I don't hear crying, just a little bitch.\"\n\nThere was silence for about twenty minutes. Now everything felt like it was floating the moment I had sat down, but I didn't really notice until now. And then I noticed just how dark it was. I closed my eyes and waited till I herd my sister call my name, all the while enduring the endless silence and the black engulfing me.\n\nI think I was totally fine until I made that comeback because these beings had some sort of power over my senses. How else would they have been able to make me feel like I was floating? I say they, but the voice of both parties were identical. Identical to my own."},"395":{"title":"I dreamt about Skyrim before it happened.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/o1irz\/i_dreamt_about_skyrim_before_it_happened\/","flair":null,"author":"twdevil","selftext":"Summer 2006: I used to have this dream, it was really short and always happened minutes before I woke up.

I never want to let you down or have you go, its better off this way!\u201d I had shaken my head and laughed, turning my face to my window.\n\t\nShe carefully turned off the road and into the long paved street. We reached the gate and told the guard we were there to see Kyle, who he promptly called. After a few minutes, he let us through, and we drove into the new neighborhood. I shivered violently, as though the temperature had just dropped by half. Abby had looked over at me, concerned, \u201cHey, Kelsie, you sick or something?\u201d\n\t\n\u201cNo. No, I\u2019m just really cold. Turn down the AC or something, would ya?\u201d I had pulled on my sweater when it occurred to me that Abby\u2019s car didn't have an AC.\n\t\nThat was the start of my perfectly horrid night.\n\t\nWe had arrived with the party in full swing, everyone dancing and drinking. Abby had immediately searched for Kyle, running off, leaving me by myself. I had wondered around for a while, until I had found the hallway. I walked down the long curved hall, sitting down, my back against the wall. I sighed as the throb of the music had drummed through the walls. \n \t\n\u201cHey.\u201d I had jumped, looking up. It had been Kyle, his spiky blonde hair falling into his bright eyes. I had let my head fall down at that point, completely freaked out. I heard his laugh for the first time as I had sighed. I didn\u2019t know how long he\u2019d been standing above me, and frankly, I hadn\u2019t wanted to know.\n\t\nI now wish I had asked.\n\t\n\u201cKyle\u2026 Fuck, you scared the hell out of me, you jerk.\u201d He had leaned against the wall and started to lean toward me when I had stood up.\n\t\n\u201cAbby was looking for you. She wanted to leave, and she couldn\u2019t find you. She kinda\u2026 left.\u201d He wasn\u2019t smiling when he said this, so I inititally freaked out. Then I had realized he could have been teasing me. \n\t\n\u201cThat really isn\u2019t funny Kyle.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cI\u2019m serious. Abby left.\u201d That made me jump to my feet. I had ran to the window and looked for her bug\u2026 but it was missing. Fuck.\n\t\n\u201cDamn. She drove me here. Do you have a phone or somethin\u2019?\u201d\n\t\n\u201cYeah. Com\u2019on I\u2019ll show you.\u201d\n\t\nI would regret this forever. You\u2019d think that I would have learned by now, especially from Tristan, that you DON\u2019T follow the pretty new boy into an empty room.\n\t\nHe had opened the door for me, and I had smiled as I had stepped in.\n\t\n\u201cThanks Kyle, now I just\u2026\u2019 The door had slammed shut behind me and the lock clicked. I had turned and banged on the door, \u201cCome on, Kyle, this isn\u2019t funny.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cNo one will hear you, Kelsie. The door is soundproof. I\u2019ll be back for you after the party, don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll have fun, I promise.\u201d I could hear him laugh quietly as he had walked away from the door. I had backed away from the door, the severity of the situation causing me to shake. I had kept backing up until I had run into something hanging from the ceiling. After jumping forward, I placed my hands on the wall and had searched for a light switch. I had been looking for Abby the entire party. She\u2019d have to be looking for me by then.\n\n\t\nI really wish I hadn\u2019t turned on the light. I really do.\n"},"397":{"title":"Nosleep, we need a subreddit for real stories.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/md3ub\/nosleep_we_need_a_subreddit_for_real_stories\/","flair":null,"author":"destroyer2000","selftext":"I love reading NoSleep, but what I find more terrifying than ghost stories are the tales of real people.

As I got home and parked In the drive I took a deep breath, picked up my bag and went inside, as I sat on the couch I pulled out the pen and paper and began to write. \n\nTwo weeks had passed since Molly had stopped me outside my car. We'd met up every day since, I guessed she had no other friends in town but by the third day we were already in a relationship, quick I know but it just happened, we were meeting up again today for dinner and then heading back to her place, she was very reserved so we hadn't hooked up yet and I was sure it wouldn't be happening anytime soon. \nDinner went well and we were making out in the car before she pulled back suddenly, I looked at her surprised, this was the first time she had done anything like this. She gave me a little smile and softly whispered \"My place\".\nI drove quite quickly considering the mood I was in, Molly giggled a lot on the way there and kept rubbing my thigh. She wanted me BAD!!\nWe had barely got in the door before her dress was being unzipped, she ran upstairs into her room and I followed quickly, as she was undressing I remembered all the times she had almost caught me looking in on her from the tree outside her window, she was naked and grabbed me, pushing me towards the bed, as she began to blow me I remembered how she had laughed at me as Shaun, the school bully had cracked three of my ribs and broken my arm, I was almost finished as I remembered how she had rejected me over and over again during whenever I had asked her out, as she climbed on top of me I saw her face and thought of the time she pretended to like me just to get me into the woods, where she would later leave me stranded, naked, miles away from my house.\n\nAs she was moaning and I got into it, angrier with each thrust, I came inside of her, but she wasn't done yet, I lay on my back and she lay on top of me on her back. As I slowly worked away I had soon had enough, I became rougher, my forearm was tight under her chin and around her neck, I brought my other hand over her mouth her hands began slapping at my arm and hand, I squeezed tighter and began to whisper in her ear, \"Oh Molly, you stupid girl, do you not remember how you treated me before? All the rejections? The laughing as I lay bleeding in so much pain?\". Her body became tense and I could see her eyes becoming wider, \"Yes you remember now don't you whore!!\". I began to squeeze tighter as she squirmed and tried to wriggle free of my grip, \"No, there's no leaving now!\" I squeezed her neck until I heard a crack and she went limp. I slide her off me and got dressed, shut all the curtains and walked slowly to my car, as I opened the boot I grabbed the Paper, I walked back to the room where the dead slut was and put the paper on her bed next to her before I left.\nIt read\n'Today you wont feel anymore, you'll be left alone, isolated, DEAD. This was your own doing. I always remember.'\nHer still blue eyes looked at the ceiling and her long brown hair was a mess, I left with the image of her like that in my head, my thing's were in the trunk and I didn't look back as I left. \n\nAs I was driving I pulled the ticket out of my jacket pocket, next stop Italy...

After stumbling upon this I was creeped out of the dog in the picture, and even restrained myself from looking at it. From time to time my thoughts of smiledog slowly vanished and I no longer was afraid of what seemed to be a photo shopped image of a dog smiling. I couldn't imagine it ever visiting me, so I brushed off the crazy idea from my mind. It was just a picture after all.\n\nFast forward to last night. It was a long day and I was exhausted, went to sleep at an unusual time. I slept roughly from 9:15 PM to 5:05 AM. I remember being in a dream that was vivid and very lucid. This took place in my own home rather than somewhere else which seemed as real as ever to me. I went to go out to my balcony for a smoke and was greeted by my cat. He was an alley cat so he spent a lot of his time outside. Something was strange about him though, he just stood in the doorway looking at me and was unresponsive when I would call him inside. Looking down at the cigarette in my hand I realized I didn't have a lighter on me, so I went to my room and got one. With the back door still open I returned to my living room which leads to the back door and froze dead in my tracks. My cat was now replaced with a husky who sat there and stared at me with a grin so wide showing humanly emotion. I was terrified and didn't really know if I was dreaming at this point or not. Everything was so real. I stood there not taking my eye off the dog who seemed to be amused with my fear. I wanted to close the door and hide but his presence drew me into a hypnotic trance which was unstoppable. The expression on his face never changed, he never blinked an eye. I watched as he walked in towards me in my paralysed physical state. I wanted to wake up if I could but didn't know how. It was until he came face to face with me that I managed to wake up. I sat upright in my bed and scanned the room in fear that I still wasn't safe. I turned on the lights and here I am writing this for a sense of closure.

I finally have caught up to the modern generation. It looked so shiny! I opened up my phone. First thing i did was install some apps. You tube,Twitter,Facebook all that kind of stuff. I wanted to take my first photo taken on my new phone. I took a quick selfie at my home, and looked at my photo. I didnt notice anything at first. Until i showed the photo to my bro. He quickly pointed out there was a man looking at me through my window. My heart dropped.\n\nWho was that? Why was he looking at me through my window? So many unanswered questions i had. I was actually afraid to sleep now knowing the fact that there could be a person watching me as i sleep.\n\nI asked my brother \"H-Hey can i stay over at your house for a couple days\"\n\nHe responded \"Aww is little bro scared a persons gonna kill him\"\n\nI said \"Stop teasing me! im serious.\"\n\nHe said with a tone \"Fine but you better not do anything unless told so in there got it?\" \"Got it\" I said.\n\nI dont know what happened with my brother and me. We were great friends in our childhood. But he just drifted away from me all of a sudden. I have nobody that i live with. I deleted my first photo with the man in it. I took a new one and claimed it as my \"first\" photo. Me and my brother were in the photo. We both were smiling. My brothers smiles in photos were always fake. Now that i think about it he hasn't smiled in a while like a true smile.\n\nI went to my bros house. He said that i could sleep on the couch. Meanwhile he gets a comfy bed. I found it hard to sleep on his cold, leather couch.\n\nBut i finally slept. In the middle of the night i heard something. It sounded like a ping. I looked at my phone. It was 4:47 but there was a notification that caused the ping. A text message. From a unknown person. I opened it. It read \"Hello Micheal found me in your photo? Good im going to appear in a lot more :)\"\n\nI was scared. Its been a while since I was this scared. I didn't want to alert my brother considering he wont wake up even if i do he will just go back to sleep. I recorded a video. In the video i said 'Hi my names Mike im recording this in the middle of the night um there is a man stalking me and im recording this just in case he shows up and it will be proof for the police\" I ended the video. I looked at the video. Behind me and behind the couch. He was standing there the whole time. I dont know how i didn't realize this while recording\n\nI slept again. The next day. I didn't feel safe wherever i went, because i knew he would keep following me. I was walking to the store to get some milk. My baby cousin needed some milk. While i was walking another notification greeted my ears.\n\nThis time it was a notification from you tube. I hadn't even subscribed to anybody yet. I tapped on the notification.\n\nIt brought me to a stream. A live stream of me walking. Somebody was streaming me walk. I quickly turned around but there was nobody with a camera. But the stream was still running. What? I thought to myself. I went into the store. The streamer followed me in. But there was nobody. At this point tears were streaming down my eyes. I was only 16 years old. I didnt want to die. At least not a painful death.\n\nI grabbed the milk,bought it, and ran to my cousins. I RAN and yet the streamer was always behind me. I got to my cousins house. I knocked on the door rapidly. My cousins mother answered. I said \"Heres the milk you wanted.\" She smiled and said \"Thank you.\" I looked at my phone when she closed the door.\n\nThe stream had stopped. I knew the stalker would come back. I knew my parents were going to get mad for doing this.\n\nI smashed the phone on the ground. Forcing it to shatter. It was a 2 day old phone. I didnt care. As long as i was living. I am now at my house.\n\nI heard something in the trashcan. It sounded like a text notification. No this wasnt happening. I looked in the trashcan. There was a phone. It looked just like the one i smashed. I picked it up from the bin. I opened the text message. It read \"Thought you could escape the phone? No i wont allow that. This is your punishment for what you have done to me.\"\n\nI knew i was screwed. I-I dont want to die. I called 911. A operator picked up saying the usual \"911 whats your emergency?\"\n\n\"T-Theres a man threatening to kill me. I live in Woodburrow street. House number 2892. \"Hang on tight im sending cops over.\"\n\nI was relieved. A few minutes later the cops came,knocked on the door, and i answered. \"Hi can i get police protection?\" The cops said \"You were saying there was a stalker?. I responded with \"The stalkers not here... or at least i think.\" They said they were going to protect me. A notification popped up. I pressed it. It was another stream. It looked like a go pro was attached to somebodys head and was streaming. I showed the cops the stream. The streamer then threw a knife. The knife went through the window and sliced through the two cops head at once. I was the only one alive in the house.\n\nI accepted death. I texted both my parents \"Goodbye i loved you.\"\n\nI killed myself. I stabbed myself with a knife. But i didnt die. I should have died. The streamer texted me \"NO. You will live through your punishment sent by god himself.\n\nThis was my life now. I am now writing this in my home. The streamers still streaming. I going to end this. The streamer said if i dont stop he will kill me. I will tell you if i am alive.

When we found out we were going to be roommates she was thrilled. I myself didn't care if we lived together or not. When we first arrived at college she decorated our room in pinks and purples with black lace going around the whole rooms.                                       \nI really have never had a boyfriend but during our first month Olivia seemed to be breaking hearts left and right and this just seemed to be normal. She is now dating a boy named ,Chad. I can obviously could why she would go for him seeing he is tall and very handsome.\nOne night while I was studying in our room Olivia was out with Chad on their 4th date. There was an obvious chill in the room and I decided that I would throw in the towel early and just get a few extra hours of sleep.\nA few hours after I went to bed I was woken up by a heart wrenching scream. I couldn't tell where it was coming from and I frankly didn't care. I got up and decided I would just go use the restroom and head back to bed. When I got up I heard some moving around in the room and brushed it off as the room shaking as I was walking. Right after I opened the door I heard a sigh coming from behind me and brushed it off as I started to head down the pitch black hall towards the restroom. \nAfter I cleaned my urinary system I headed back to my room to head back to my comfy bed. When I opened the room it stank of iron that just seemed to attack my nostrils. I thought of turning on the lights to get my Febreeze but I didn't want to wake Olivia.I climbed into bed and heard heavy breathing coming from the corner, it was very loud and obnoxious. I didn't know Olivia snored but I really have never been awake while she's been asleep.\nThe next morning I woke up with the sun shining into our room almost making it impossible for me to see. I rubbed my eyes still releasing the room was full of a terrible irony smell. I looked over at Olivia's bed and shrieked. She was stabbed over and over and on the wall, with the black lace thrown on the ground was,\"Don't turn the lights on...\" "},"407":{"title":"The message","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/hv4fc\/the_message\/","flair":null,"author":"gloomybear666","selftext":"Don\u2019t dismiss this outright as the work of some raving lunatic.

So this story happened a few years ago (about 4-5).\n\nSo as you can see by the title I went camping, now I do this quite often and never had problems, fact being there are a lot of nice nature parks nearby.\nAs ever I packed my stuff, took everything I needed (tent, sleeping bag, etc.) and headed out. Now I usually have this place I go to all the time but this time I thought\"let's go somewhere else\", so I did. Fact being I went camping frequently I didn't bother telling anyone and didn't take my phone. I was only gonna be away for a day or two to get some rest and fresh air, how I wish I had told someone now. The first day was perfect I hiked 'till I found a nice spot and pitched my tent, the sun was still out so I went and collected some wood for a fire (a small bonfire is just so relaxing when camping) so after I collected the wood and started the fire I started to warm my dinner (regular MRE). Since it was getting darker I decided to throw some more wood on the fire for more warmth and light, but when I went to take the wood I saw there wasn't as much as I thought there should be. At first I thought it was an error on my part, so I didn't make much of it, as it was getting darker I decided to get the wood closer to me so I took the flashlight and fetched it. Yet again less wood, I was starting to get suspicious but since this was a place many people visited I thought it was just someone taking it (oh how I wish it was another person). after getting the wood I suddenly heard something, I turned my head and lo and behold: another camper, I asked him if he took some wood from the pile he said he didn't.\n\nNow seriously if you went camping and started losing your tinder you would start to panic, I didn't I just took the flashlight and went to get some more, I managed to get some and my pile was still equally big as before, but I had forgotten to put new batteries in my flashlight and the ones in it had just died as I came back. So after getting ready to sleep I heard another sound but since I saw the guy before I thought it was him again, but then I heard the wood shift so I went outside, not a soul in sight and some wood was missing from the pile. Just then I tried the flashlight, it went on for a split second but it was enough, I saw the shadow I instantly knew what it was: \"D\". \n\nnow to clarify \"D\" was kind of a myth to me, I had heard people talk about it of how they saw it and even were stalked by it but I thought those were just some stupid tales. Boy was I wrong, I get now why no two sightings of it were the same: it changes form for every person. I turns into something you'll be afraid of for the rest of your life, to this day I'm still scared it'll find me again.\n\nas soon as I saw \"D\" I knew I had to keep the fire burning but two problems arose: it had taken wood and I didn't have enough to last the night to start with. so I started to relight the fire, using more wood than responsible and just when I ran out of wood I knew I would be done for: I had only lasted about an hour and I knew it would still be hours 'till the sun rose. Running seemed a viable option, for about 5 seconds, I saw it move again faster than humanly possible, especially for me (I am nor fit nor slim and can't run worth a damn) so that idea was quickly abandoned. just when the fire started dying it rushed towards me and sliced my chest, despite the pain something more astonishing happened: the sun rose.This is impossible I told myself the sun isn't due to rise for several hours, and yet it did. so I started running but suddenly it became dark again and it was able to attack me again. I rushed back to my tent: light. What the hell is going on I thought to myself, so I started to collect more and more wood, but could only find a small amount. when darkness fell shortly after (impossibly short even) I started to light a small fire using the wood sparingly, but the task was impossible. So the fire died and it attacked again yet again hitting me in the chest, this cycle went on and on for what felt like an eternity and suddenly I said to myself \"fuck it, let's run\" so I started running towards what I hoped to be society. It hit me a surreal amount of times, I wanted to just stop running and give in, but something kept me going, 'till this day I don't know what it was but it saved me. so after I left the forest and found my way back home I suddenly realized: I wasn't hurt, at least not physically I had no cuts but to this day I am pretty much devoid of emotions. Believe me this is way worse than any injury: you don't feel human anymore and I still feel \"D\" lurking behind me every day, it's in my head and wants to be freed, but I won't let that happen.\n\nThat's why I'm writing this, I know many of you won't like it and probably think this was posted in the wrong subreddit. But this was my story about depression, one which 'till this day lingers in me. Don't be like me: tell someone when you feel down everyday and especially when you (like me) have given up on life. Emotions are valuable and happiness especially so. Thank you for reading, and if you feel sad remember: perfection does exist. You are perfect the way you are, the reason you are the way you are is because you are perfect that way, don't let anyone tell you different please don't. Don't become like me."},"411":{"title":"This is a throwaway account so don't try to find me.

So here goes. Read and wince through this tale and understand I'm just a typical blue collar kind of guy.  Thanks Tor.\n\nMy aunt died of cancer 4 years ago.  It was the worst point in my life.  We were very close.  When she passed away she left me a fortune.  In the four years since her passing and my gain in \"wealth\" my family has stolen from me, and what they didn't steal the \"auctioneer\" took in the lawsuit.  My mother gave me the auctioneer's card and told me that I should trust him because my Aunt bought many items from him and he would treat me right.  Treating me right meant taking 3.4 million in priceless antiques and then auctioning them off for pennies on the dollar to marks at the auction, who in turn gave the items back to him.  It was all neat and tidy.  Next because I was stupid enough to sign an open contract, he came into my home and simply chose everything he thought he could make a dime from.  He said I was withholding antiques.  I told him these were MY things.  The judge in his state sided with him.  Surprise surprise.  \n\nOnce I lost everything I got depressed.  I began drinking too much.  I lost my job because of it.  For the next four years I started the slow spiral of selling everything to keep going.  I sold anything the auctioneer didn't take.  Even the judge in his state wouldn't allow him to take real estate or the house, as housing and land is not really considered an antique now is it?  To keep going I sold all the furniture, the cars and then last week I finally moved the old safes in the basement as these heavy things are usually the last to go aren't they?\n\nMy aunt was married briefly for approximately five years to an eccentric kinda guy.  Sorry if I am sketchy on the timeline.  He was an odd collector.  We can call him Roger.  Roger had a odd hobby in that he loved to play impersonate people.  He had been arrested several times but due to his money, that was soon to by my aunt's, he never served any time and the charges were dropped.  Once he was arrested for doing license checks dressed as a state trooper.  Another time he was arrested for pretending to be a Marine recruiter at a high school.  I was never close to Roger and he was always a distant man and I wondered why my Aunt loved him so.  Roger died of an overdose of some kind of designer synthetic opiate.  He paid off doctors that wrote him scripts due to his \"cough\".  That's how rich people get drugs.  It destroyed my Aunt at the time as they had been fighting pretty badly before his death.  It was the years after his death that my Aunt went into an antique buying craze that soon was left to me.  You know it was kind of like something evil was in the house causing all of this.  First, Roger dying in his bed from an overdose, and then my Aunt not too long after.  I always suspected Radon.  Ha, Radon.\n\nSorry for going off on a tangent like that.  Well anyway, with the gun safes empty after \"dear old dad\" stole all the guns, I thought I should move them out and get a little money for them.  I literally had to make a path to the basement door due to all the costumes and utility belts and helmets laying everywhere.  I thought to myself that I should start a fucking Halloween shop.  The first safe moved somewhat easy when pushed on the short shag carpet.  Up high on the left hand side in a dark area I found a Ruger Mk 1 .22 pistol.  I was actually surprised that my father didn't steal it until I realized the serial numbers were ground off.  Dear old dad wouldn't want to own an illegal gun now would he?  What a fucking boy scout.  There were still 7 rounds in the magazine.  There was no way to sell it so I thought that I should probably destroy it or throw it in the river.  \n\nAnyway, so I am moving the safes out to the door to line up for potential buyers and after moving the thirteenth gun safe, I found something in a hole that I could only suppose was put there by Roger.  In the hole concrete floor was an old wooden box that looked like it had about a million stickers and old packing slips on it.  The box was maybe 12 or so inches square.  I opened the box and inside was some crazy looking white gimp suit and a folded up note.  The note had some writing that I could not read like some kind of code and at the end of the note in English it read, Roger, lets see what you make of it.  \n\nOnce I pulled out this \"costume\" all I could think of was that it was sheer, and stretchy and it would totally make my balls look huge.  I figured maybe it was some kind of movie or TV prop outfit  for those blue or green backgrounds.  It's all white, and it has these black spots in random sizes all over the suit.  I stopped what I was doing and put it up for size and what do ya know, it looked about my size.  I put it on and pulled the hood over, and I looked in the mirror and I looked just like an albino web slinger from a famous comic you may have read, only fat, and really really self conscious about how it showcased my junk.  I went upstairs and pulled on some sweat shorts over it and that made me look like an albino basketball player with a beer gut and a small pigment issue.  After seeing how unflattering this thing was on me, I took it off and it has been wadded in the floor in my room until last night.\n\nI sold the safes and I gotta tell ya that helped me pay the bills for a while.  Selling 26 gun safes will still net some money and I managed to pay the property tax to keep the home and spent the rest on bread, bologna and scotch.\n\nSo that leads me here today.  I just woke up in the floor hungover from what I thought would be my last night on this shit ball.  I remember sitting in my last piece of furniture in the living room, an old ratty recliner, and drinking scotch and watching digital Air T.V.  I think it was a \"Lost in Space\" marathon.  Last night I was going to do it.  I was done and double fuck you to everything.  So anyway I wake up from the floor, I'm in this spotty albino Spiderman uniform and there lies that Ruger on the floor with the bolt opened...empty.  There are 7 pieces of empty .22 brass on the floor.\n\nThe thing that I can't understand is why would there be seven bullet holes in the walls of my living room?  One through the wall to my left, one in the T.V., one through the window, one through the floor, one through the ceiling, one through a picture on the wall to the right and I can't find the other one yet, but .22 bullet holes are small so I am going to keep looking for it but I know for sure, it isn't in me....\n\nI am pretty sure I am going crazy.  If anyone can help me, please help.\n\nEdited 3\/18\/15\n\n@ cjrocketman89 you read my mind :)\n\n@ MrPhagBaggington. I did as you suggested.  I live on about three acres of land with the house so I don't think anyone heard the shots.  The sound may have been contained within the walls.  However, I did look around and i am sure I didn't accidentally shoot anyone while I was drunk.  I live by myself and it appears the .22s were embedded in all the walls\/tv etc.  So that is something.\n\nI know Reddit can be rough on poor spellers and writers so thank you for being kind.  I have always been scared to post because everyone is such a grammar Nazi but I don't feel quite so scared about typing this out and I am willing to keep sharing if you are interested.\n\nHere is where things get interesting.  I have to say my hands are trembling while I type this.  Let me pour a scotch real quick and I can get back to it.  Ok, so today I went to Wally and bought a box of 50 .22 bullets.  My dear cocksucker of a father stole all of the ammo with the guns...yay dad.  I was actually surprised to find any with all the ammo scares out there.  Everyone is hoarding and everyone is so paranoid.  Some say the gov is wanting to destroy the .22 because people teach kids or, some say the factory that built them burnt down.  I hear the first metallic cartridge was the .22 and maybe the same machines that made them finally broke down?  Who knows?  It was absolute luck to find them.  Anyway, today I took the suit downstairs into the basement to do a little testing.\n\nThe only explanation that I can come up with is that either I was so black out drunk that I either just went wild and shot the gun around the living room, or possibly something else may have happened.  I had to do a couple of tests.  Now down in the basement is a dress up dreamworld.  Not only this, with all the guns stolen there is still a good bit of paramilitary shit down here as well.  I'm not really a gun guy but I know one end from the other, and there is still a whole lot of \"accessories\".  There are handcuffs, flak jackets, web gear etc.  My uncle in law really fancied himself a special forces nut.  Among the accessories I found a box full of what all I can say are old timey bank bags, with zippers.  They look used and old but they would suit my purpose for what I needed to do.  I took the bank bags today and filled them with good old red clay dirt and zipped them up, about 35 or so all together.  Next I stacked them up down in the basement so I could protect myself.  \n\nI took the suit and put it on a line with some clothes pins.  It is hung up in the basement as if someone was wearing it.  I know this may sound crazy but I swear the spots are moving.  It is like they are slightly in different positions every time I look back.  There are thirteen spots in all on the suit.  They are of varying sizes and shapes and I don't really know what it means, but here goes I'm going to shoot at a crazy looking leotard.  \n\nSo I'm behind the sandbags protecting myself and I load the Ruger and put 8 rounds in the magazine.  I pull the bolt back and take aim.  I shoot at the suit and once I do I swear I see a spot move suddenly exactly where I was aiming.  Next thing I know the bullet goes wizzing over my head.  I was quite glad I put on the pot helmet :)  This doesn't make any sense.  I shoot 7 more rounds and one bullet goes through the suit and hits the wall behind it.  The next bullet goes out it's left side and hits the wall to the left.  Basically every bullet I shoot and it seems a spot moves exactly where I am shooting, and apparently it seems the bullet is going out of a random spot elsewhere on the suit.  One in the floor, one in the ceiling, they just seem to shoot out somehow from the suit in some random direction.  Wow, that is kind of dangerous, huh? \n\nSooooo, what do I think up next?  Well as a good little atheist scientist I have to test this a little more thoroughly.  I put the suit back on but as I do I notice there is a small tag on the back of the neck.  It says 919.  What does that mean?  Is this some kind of government thing?  Maybe prototype number 919?  Well anyway I take the suit and stretch it on, pull the cowl over and decide that I need to take a chance.  With the way I was feeling that night I knew I was done.  I had to have shot myself.  Soooo, I'm gonna do it again.  I have to shoot myself. \n\nNow I'm not drunk with bravery and I just don't want to die today so I decide, well since I am left handed I will shoot my right hand.  Nope, not a smart move..I need hands.  What can I shoot that I can live without, well I figure maybe a foot?  People did that stuff in Vietnam...the million dollar wound LOL.  Jeez this is gonna hurt.  So anyway I put one bullet in the ruger mag and slide the bolt back and point it at my foot.  So much for my career as a 46 year old track star.  I pull the trigger, and you would not believe what happened.\n\nI pull the trigger on the pistol at my right foot.  I see just barely a spot move on the suit exactly where the barrel was directly pointed and next thing I know I hear a \"woosh\" from the hole positioned exactly where my neck is.  I was facing the sand bags and just after the gun went off I hear the brass hit the concrete floor and I see sand start trickling out of the top sandbag fort that I had made for myself.\n\nI reloaded the magazine.  I always put 8 in it but maybe it holds 9?  Whatever, I shoot myself 8 times and I never feel a thing.  I shoot my foot again. I shoot my chest, I shoot myself several times and each time I see like a flash one of the spots goes exactly where I am pointing and what I can only guess  is that the bullets are somehow \"sensed\" by the closest hole and then it rushes to that spot, only to exit out of a hole randomly out of another spot.  I didn't feel a thing.  I shot myself 8 times and I didn't feel a damned thing!!!   This is amazing!  I didn't even hear the gunfire as loud...it seemed muffled with the suit on.  I don't know what to do now but this just may be the luck I have finally been hoping for.  \n\nOk, this is about all I can type for this evening.  I am going to do a little more testing tomorrow or the next day and I promise to report what I find here.  \n\nAll I can say is I have something really really special, and I am not going to let it go until I figure out exactly what it is all about.\n\nTime for another drink or two to celebrate.\n \n@cjrocketman89  I didn't think about the invisible angle I will do some more testing and see what I can find.\n"},"412":{"title":"Stitch is attacking the reddit community.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/18of7p\/stitch_is_attacking_the_reddit_community\/","flair":null,"author":"Sabine08","selftext":"There are an alarming amount of redditers seeing or dreaming of Stitch.

Actual camping, near Pike Lake ( yes there are Pike fish in it ) little did we know It was following us.\n\nIt all started the first of 3 nights we started to hear strange noises. Because this was a common camping area, and there are lots of wildlife so we passed it off as rowdy campers, or deer in the forest. Although as a vivid paranormal \" junkie \" I was kind of creeped out, so I tried to find out what it really was, after my friend Dane decided to go to sleep, my other friend Kaitlyn went searching for an answer. \n\nAfter about five or ten minutes I started to get the \" I'm being watched \" feeling so I told Kaitlyn and she felt this feeling also, so we headed back to our tents, she had a separate tent from Dane and I. Little did I know the next night would get even worse.\n\nSo the next day we almost forgot about last night. That was, until night fall. Again the noises started, but this time they sounded closer, more diabolical, heavy breathing, very loud footsteps, and occasionally faint high-pitched noises. Again the \" being watched \" felling washed over me, but this time stronger, as if what was watching me wanted to do harm. I was about to have a heart attack, so I turned on my flashlight and waved it about trying to find what was stalking us. I found it and became histerical.\n\n What I saw was not human, though it looked like one. It was very skinny, almost as if it hadn't eaten in a month. It was extremely tall, I might be exadurating but it was about 7 or 8 feet tall. It wore a suit, black jacket, tie, and trousers with a white shirt. I would have thought it to be human if not for one BIG detail. It's face was featureless. No eyes. No mouth. No hair. Nothing, nothing at all. Again being a paranormal \" junkie \" I had read about something like it one. It was called \"Slender Man\". Naturally I freaked out, and ran into the tent, zipped it and faught back tears. My friends asked what was wrong so I said \"I saw IT\" I screamed, \"what?\" they asked \" Slender Man \" I shouted.\n\nMy friend Dane, being a skeptic, checked it out, he came back awhile later saying it was just a maniquin, although I didn't believe him. I knew what I saw. I laid there all night, not even close to sleep. Knowing it was going to come back. The next day my friends and I went to see where the \"maniquin\" was set up, but it was gone, of coarse. Dane and Kaitlyn both decided someone was pranking us. Although I knew different.\n\nThat night, it happened again, the noises, the feeling. Then It came, I saw it, and just stood there, paralyzed in fear, there was no light on it, but I saw it in the moonlight. It was coming for me. It was only about 3 yards away when Dane called my name, I looked behind me. He wanted, me to roast a marshmallow and relax. Him and Kaitlyn both were relaxed thinking it was a prank. I looked back, terrified to see Slender Man. But what greeted my eyes, scared my even more than seeing It would have. I saw nothing. Nothing at all.\n\nI know what your thinking, It was just my imagination. But I know what I saw. And if I hadn't looked away, I probably wouldn't have posted this. Although I was wondering why it didn't attack me when I looked away. So Dane, Kaitlyn, and I booked it out of there.

What an egregious age to be. Boy or girl, your body begins the \"awkward\" phase, and there's nothing you can do about it. Life is seems hopeless, at least that's what your hormones tell you. Hair starts to grow everywhere. One day, you notice a couple hairs on your nut sack, and then the next week you harbor a nice little rain forest of pubes. Your emotions decide they want to run wild. One day, you feel like Buddha. An enlightened soul, that wants peace on earth for everyone. The next day (or hour, if you're a female), you feel like Adolf Hitler himself, and anger burns through your bones. Yep, looking back I don't believe anybody I knew had a pleasant thirteen.\n\nEspecially me.\n\nWriting as a male, my next question is directed to us neanderthals.  What would you do when your parents are out of town, and you have a computer all to yourself? If your answer was anything but internet porn, you failed the question. So around 6:30 that day, I was knee deep in delicious, sinful smut. I was just about to finish when a message popped up on my screen. \"Hey there sexy, I'm hot and lonely. I need some company,\" Score. Being thirteen, I opened the message. KittySexBunny109. \"How creative.\" I thought to myself. \"Hi\" I meagerly replied back. \"Why don't you come over, and keep me company.\" the sexy muse replied back. \"I'm at 5402, Bagby Drive.\" That was all the way across town, so I gave her my address instead. \n\nLike I said, I was an idiotic moron when I was thirteen.\n\nI awaited, with baited breath for my goddess to \"cum\" to my aid. It was 5 hours before anything happened. I went upstairs to go to bed when I heard a faint knock on the door. My head shot up, and I bolted downstairs to address my goddess. I slowly opened the door, and a lady with long black hair, and a long black coat walked in. \"Hello\", she cooed with a voice that sounded like an angel's trumpet. \"Are you ready for me, my love.\" I started to speak, but my throat suddenly turned into a desert. I tried to walk towards her, but I couldn't bring my legs to work. The woman took of one of her gloves, and the softest hand caressed my cheek. A wave of ecstasy shot through my body, and I felt very much alive. \n\nI looked up at the woman....and saw that she had a small cut on her face. I still could not speak so I just pointed to her cheek. She laughed and to my horror, started to dig at the wound until it became bigger and bigger, and the she ripped off her whole face and let out a huge toothy grin. \"Are you still ready for me baby.\" \"NO!\" I screamed as loud as I could, but only a whimper escaped my lips. The woman scowled at me and grabbed me by the hair. She lifted me up off the ground, and then her faced stretched to her chest. She then let out a huge shriek, and threw me across the room. \"No one tells me no little boy.\" She stood over me, and opened her coat. Her body was rapidly decaying, and I could see maggots slither in and out of crevices in her chest. Her eyes were much larger, and now glowed red. Then she looked at me, and she smiled even bigger than before. \"I'll let you live.\" she said. \"But you are now mine forever. My servant to bring me food.\" She then stripped me naked, and hung me upside-down from the kitchen chandelier. \"If you disobey me, I will always know where you are. Always remember, that my eyes are upon you.\" She then darted out of my house. \n\nLuckily, I was able to get down from the chandelier. A small whisper told me to go to my computer. I obeyed. Timmy Farland, on 21st street was delving into some midnight porn. I sent him a message. He responded, and I told him where to go. I had to. \n\nTimmy didn't show up for school the next morning. That afternoon, we learned his parents found him hanging in the basement. Only I knew what happened to him.\n\nBilly Jenkins walked into the trap the next month. Then Nate Garza. Then Sam Smith. Don't blame me, blame my idiot thirteen year old self.\n\nI don't discourage you from internet porn, but if you ever get a message from CockWhore21, don't reply. And we'll leave it at that.  \n\n"},"420":{"title":"R\/nosleep USED TO scare me","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/ru77h\/rnosleep_used_to_scare_me\/","flair":null,"author":"Way2Fabulous","selftext":"I discovered reddit almost a year ago now and loved it.

My name is Tabitha. I'm the catfish of catfish. I'm lonely, depressed, hurt, traumatized. My life is nothing but your average abuse story. To cope with everything, I made a fake Twitter profile. My name was Dominica \"Dixie\" O'Neil. I used a fake picture and made up a complete backstory for her. She lived in South Dakota, was fifteen turning sixteen years old, had a mother and father, no siblings and two pets, two dogs named Coconut and Butter. I made her not the smartest girl in the world. She was very unintelligent using text slang far too often and misspelled every word that wasn't. The picture I used was of a blonde girl with brown eyes in a pink shirt smiling. It was a selfie. I made Dixie into a complex person with a lot going on in her life so people would believe it was true. My username was @Dixie_Obelle (I've deleted it) and I had very few followers. I followed a small group of people. A few celebrities Dixie \"liked\" and I followed all my followers back.\n\nOne day after about two months of having my Twitter account, a girl named Mikayla Johnson followed me. She messaged me as soon as I followed back. She used the same speaking pattern as Dixie and seemed just as unintelligent and had no opinions on anything. We bonded over our love of Niall Horan and Sylvester Stallone. She lived in Maine at the time and was thirteen, only a few years younger than I was supposed to be. We became friends quickly, bonding over our mutual love of Sylvester Stallone the most. I told her I had watched almost all of his movies and she said she had as well. I told her my favorites were Rocky II and Grudge Match. Hers were Rocky I and Rambo I. We had a common wish to kill his wife Jennifer Flavin because we thought she was an ungrateful bitch who only loved him for his money and didn't care about him. We agreed his three youngest daughters were brats and we wished to kill them as well. Mikayla had even a story about how she killed Jennifer and married Sylvester's son George (a fictional character). I had even started working on one as well to play into my character even more.\n\nWe were friends for a while. I had told her my backstory:\nI was sixteen years old with an inbred child named Louise who's father was my dad. My father raped me when I was ten and I got pregnant. Louise was born and I had to give her up for adoption because I couldn't take care of her. My father continuously raped me until he abused my mother (hit her in the face) and fled to England, not before telling me how I was a worthless child with no future, which was true because I was a high school dropout doing nothing but spending my days online talking to a friend I had never met and who had only seen one picture of me. Mikayla believed me and opened up to me about her past. She lived in Maine. Her mom was Irish and her father was from New Zealand. She had two older brothers and an older sister. Her mother had fallen pregnant six months earlier, which sent her father into a violent outrage causing him to hit her in the stomach, making her miscarry the baby. Her parents got divorced and her father moved to New Zealand to be with his family. Her mother moved her, her two brothers and sister to Ireland to take care of her grandmother. Mikayla was miles away from where I really was; Arizona. She also said she was date-raped by a boy a school at a party when she was twelve and had an abortion. She also said she got pregnant by another boy and had an abortion, which I tried to be very supportive of.\n\nMikayla told me she was bipolar and self-harmed. I told her I self-harmed, too, and we talked about the rush we got seeing our blood flow out of our arms onto the bathroom sink. She had threatened to commit suicide a number of times saying: FINE ILL JUST GO KILL MYSELF BYE DIXIE\nI coaxed her out of it many times and threatened to kill myself as well. We had a big fight once over the fact Mikayla hid the fact she thought Jennifer Flavin was cool. We typed insults to each other bringing up the times the other was raped and being very mean to each other. Mikayla brought two friends into the argument to help calm me down, which didn't help at all. I said I was going to commit suicide and went to a mental institution for three weeks. While I was gone, I made another character named Marina who was friends with Dixie. Marina became friends with Mikayla in Dixie's absence. They talked about things and Marina revealed some secrets about Dixie that Mikayla didn't know: Dixie's father had come back from England right before her latest suicide attempt and raped her again, telling her she was a worthless slut, who'd end up pregnant again by some male prostitute with an std and no man would ever want her. That's why she attempted suicide the last time. Mikayla slightly grossed out and said she didn't want to hear anymore.\n\nWhen I, Dixie, got back, I told Mikayla that I was diagnosed with depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia and I was on medication. I calmed down my person by 100% for a while before getting off my medicine, bringing up serial killers, hearing someone come in my house that raped me and kill my dog. I disappeared for a month and Marina had to calm Mikayla down from her panic attack. Marina would update her regularly on how Dixie was doing; she talked to her mom and reported back to Mikayla what she said.\n\nWhen I got back the second time, Mikayla convinced me to create a Kik, Facebook, Skype, Askfm, Instagram and Snapchat. I created each with the same picture. On Facebook, she was my only friend so I decided to friend request her two friends I knew from our huge fight. Both accepted and I went to People You May Know and friend requested everyone I had at least two friends in common with. Mikayla freaked out that I friend requested her family and told me not to request anymore. One guy thought I was a catfish (he caught on to me) and I convinced him I wasn't with a long explanation of why I requested him, which he believed. Mikayla kept wanting to call me on Facebook. I did once with an insanely thick country accent. She believed it and wanted to talk more but I said I couldn't or didn't want to. She tried to Skype me but I said I was ugly and didn\u2019t want to show my face.\n\nWe talked for months and new each other's life stories. We were best friends. One day she insisted on Skyping, which I had no choice to answer. I pressed accept and there she was, looking at me, not Dixie. \"Who are you?\" she asked in a thick Irish accent, \"where's Dixie?\" I laughed nervously, \"Dixie isn't real. I created her with a picture of somebody else and made up a story for her,\" I replied. \"What the fuck?\" she exclaimed and I explained the whole story to her. She was unhappy, shouting cuss words at me screaming about how she'd come find me and kill me. She got up from where she was sitting and scrambled around her room looking for something. She had a knife. I asked her not to cut herself, saying it wasn't worth it that I'd still be her friend. \"My life is a lie,\" she whispered in an angry tone, cutting down her arm. Down the road not across the street. She put her pointer and middle fingers on the fresh cut she made and got up and rubbed it on her Rambo poster. \"You see what you did? You ruined everything! Sylvester wouldn't like you, you cunt! Fuck you! Look what you're making me do!\" she screamed as she started banging her bloodied forearm against the poster screaming a shrill shriek as she did it. Her mom burst into the room and tried to get her to calm down. They fought, her mom telling her to stop but Mikayla wouldn't listen. It seemed like thirty minutes they shrieked at each other, Mikayla struggling to get out of her mom's grasp. When she did, she ran for the window (she'd previously told me that they lived in a two story house). She slightly opened it and tried to jump out but her mom grabbed her around the waist and pulled her away, arms and legs flailing like a cartoon damsel in distress. Finally her dad came in the room and forcefully grabbed Mikayla and flung her over his shoulder and stomped out of the room. Her mother noticed that her computer was on, gave me a horrified look and ended the chat.\n\nIt's been two months and I haven't heard from Mikayla. I cancelled all of Dixie's accounts (and Marina's) and made ones under my real name, followed Mikayla on Twitter, messaged her on Kik and friend requested her on Facebook in hopes of a response but her Twitter hasn't been updated since right before the psychotic rage incident on Skype. I want to apologize to her and tell her my story, that I'm a broken human being and I\u2019m so sorry for causing he so much stress but I don't know what happened to her."},"422":{"title":"That was never my sister","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/2ubx7x\/that_was_never_my_sister\/","flair":null,"author":"farttart2","selftext":"I am not writing this is in my basement trying to hide from this so called  \"sister\" before she gets home and sorry for any typos so lets get on with this.

Pffffft. What a load of runny dog shit. **I** didn't vote for him and, in fact, no one I know or have talked to in the past year voted for him either. \n\nWhat happened to our \"voices matter?\"\n\nI can't even begin to wrap my head around this situation. We just elected someone who has *zero* experience in our political system. This guy - this fucking guy - has only been involved in our world for the past two years. **Two years!** That's it! Yet we're all expected to follow suit and just cozy up next to him and give him undying support.\n\nFuck that.\n\nThis election was rigged. I can't prove it, but dammit...I know it was. Like I said, no one I know of voted him in - and I know basically everyone, aside from a few of the people in our foreign territories. Well, I don't know them personally. I watch them. We watch everyone. Just like us in the Headquarters, exactly zero percent of the population was stupid enough to vote for someone who doesn't understand our system.\n\nIt doesn't matter, though. Yesterday, I decided to take a stand against this. \n\nWe have rules. Not guidelines. Not suggestions. Rules. Rules detailing how we are allowed to conduct ourselves, how we can dress, public acts - damn near everything we do is governed by one of the rules. One rule in particular clearly states that we are not allowed to protest in city streets due to the fact that it can disrupt the general population and give us a bad image. We never really break the rules, but I felt like this was the time to make my opinion heard.\n\nI organized a protest through social media under the guise of a fake name. I wanted to get a group to run right through the streets - signs and all - not stopping until the police physically ended it. To my surprise, a couple hundred people clicked \"attending\" within the first hour. It was perfect. I sent out messages to every person and confirmed attendance. Then, I sent out of few telegrams to some people close to me to see if they wanted in on the fun - they did. \n\nWe all met in the park around 7pm to spread out signs, designate paths and escape plans, and determine our rally chants. By 9pm we were ready to mobilize. To my dismay, the group decided that we should all march as one massive unit as opposed to splitting up into smaller groups that could cover more area. That decision was going to make my personal plans a bit more difficult, but not impossible.\n\nWe began marching to the heart of city. I led the pack with two of my closer friends, chanting \"Revoke the Vote\" and keeping our group as loosely organized as possible. We barely made it a block before garnering lots of attention from the general public. Some were yelling obscenities at us. Others began to march with us. \n\nAfter another few blocks, once the group was good and worked up, I handed the syringes to my friends and we fell back to different parts of the crowd. It was hardly a chore to rally my first victim away with the pretense that I knew a way to \"*really* get our message across.\" I took him behind a small little Chinese restaurant on 42nd, and showed him the small handgun I had with me. \n\n\"A few shots in the air, and the media will swarm us, man.\" I said as I handed the gun to him. As he admired it's shoddy craftsmanship I stabbed his neck with the syringe. His crying couldn't be heard over the deafening drone of the \"Revoke the Vote\" chants. \n\nThe process for transformation takes anywhere between thirty seconds and four minutes to start, depending on the person and amount of toxin injected. This guy was a bit on the scrawny side, and before a full minute has elapsed his pores were tearing open and the sludge was forcing its way out. Brown, black, and thick - it had him entirely covered and stuck to the ground before two minutes had passed. Cocoon established. By the fourth minute, the cocoon had hardened and was beginning to crackle as the new creature was preparing to emerge. \n\nIt ripped itself from it's shell to the chorus of it's skin tearing away from the insides like Velcro peeling apart. That's always been my least favorite part, honestly. But there it was - a magnificent specimen. Oily bronzed skin, hairless body, and merged digits - it was divine. Although the creatures always have skin covering their eyes and mouths, I could have sworn this one was smiling at me as if to say \"thank you.\"\n\nIt tilted its featureless head to the sky and began twitching in small, rapid movements...a sign that my friends were also able to subdue their victims.\n\n\"Infect!\" I commanded. Without hesitation, it sprinted out into the streets, catching up to the crowd in mere seconds. I kept to the shadows while I observed the demonstration. \n\nAs it reached the back of the group, it explosively expanded its body into thousands of fibrous tendrils that covered ten or so people in the back of the crowd. The rest of the people began to turn around at the cries for help, but before they could react the other creatures overtook them as well. The lucky few that weren't instantly consumed made an honorable attempt at running away until one-by-one they were disabled by the coughing and subsequent vomiting of the sludge. Within five minutes we now had hundreds of cocoons littering the city streets. Complete infection was imminent...until our \"elected\" official decided to show his face. \n\nHe stood there, taking it all in, and in his eyes I could see the fear settling in. The underestimation of what our organization is capable of. But in a flash of intense red light, it was all gone. The creatures, the cocoons - gone. It was daylight again, and life was moving around me as if nothing had ever happened. Nothing had changed, except the two black marks I gained on each of my palms. I was done. \n\nI have to move to Canada, now. International rules will keep me away from the organization and our new leader's reach. In my ignorance I made assumptions about him based on nothing more than hearsay and frustration. \n\nNow I'm a target.\n\nThe others will surely terminate me if they see me again after my stunt. It's safe there...I hope."},"424":{"title":"The Sleep Experiment","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/8jrc24\/the_sleep_experiment\/","flair":null,"author":"kim0419ify","selftext":"It all started on that night. I got a letter in the mail and I walked in my room without Mom seeing it. I knew she would want to see. When I opened it, I immediately grabbed anything I could carry and snuck out the back door. With the address clutched in my hand, my feet carried me swiftly to my destination. After 10 minutes, I got there. When I walked in, I told the woman, \u201cI\u2019m here for the sleep experiment.\u201d She just nodded and pressed a button to open the metal door. I walked in.\n\nWhen I got inside, there was a balding man sitting at his desk. It seemed like he was waiting for me. \u201cAh, I see you\u2019ve finally made it, Parker.\u201d I just nodded and gave a wry smile. How the hell did this guy know my name? \u201c...-KER...PARKER JONES!!!\u201d The man seemed like he was trying to get my attention. \u201cO-Oh...sorry.\u201d I said in a kind of small voice. The now already frustrated looking man rubbed his temples and, after taking some deep breaths, gave me a smile. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry for ruining your daydream, but we have some important matters to attend to. Please, take a seat while I explain.\u201d He said in a bittersweet tone gesturing to a seat I haven\u2019t realized until now.\nAs I sat down, the man already seemed to be ready to explain whatever he wanted to explain. \"Now, I suppose you're here because of a letter I've sent, correct? Now I am not explaining what I meant...yet. I just want to do a measly, little experiment if that's okay?\" I then nodded, now very curious as to what he wanted me to do. \"Alright! Now, I am a neurologist, a person who studies the brain. I am trying to find a solution as to why people get nightmares from their subconscience, rather than their conscience. And, you seemed like the best person for the job. Oh, and if you want to know how, a close friend of yours told me how frequent your nightmares are.\" Joseph, you bastard! How the hell could you tell someone when I told you not to?! \"Now, I don't want to waste anymore precious time, so let's go to the room where this will be conducted.\" He said before pulling me along to the mayhem that was soon to start.\n\nI...don't remember much before the experiment started. I just remember the sharp pain I felt in several parts of my head. And then I was surrounded by darkness. And then I saw my mom washing the dishes. She was speaking to me, but I really couldn't hear what she was saying. Suddenly, my eyes dragged to a door that appeared suddenly. The shape of a man was there, but it wasn't a man. It's skin was leathery and had some deep cuts on its face. And it had a knife in its left hand. My eyes went wide like a deer in the headlights when I knew what it was going to do. My voice couldn't come out when I wanted it to and my body wouldn't move. Even though it was stalking behind her naturally, like it was meant to do this. Right when it was about to chop her head off, that was when my damn body and voice came back to me, \"MOM!!!!!!!\" I yelled until my voice went hoarse... but that didn't help at all. Her head rolled up to my foot. With that same smile of hers.\n\nAnd then I jumped up panting roughly and sweating. Putting myself, it felt like I had my pajamas on. But... I didn't have my pajamas on when I left for the experiment. And then I remembered about my mother and burst out of my room into the kitchen. To my horror, she was dead like in my dreams. When I ran to her body with tears streaming down my face and harsh sobs coming from my mouth, the letter fell to the floor and showed the message inside. It said, \"Nightmares come from your subconscience and subconscience comes from the fears of life.\""}}
