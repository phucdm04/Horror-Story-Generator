We've been largely hands-off, letting people decide with upvotes and downvotes as opposed to micro-managing.\n\nAdditionally, we didn't want to send users to subreddits owned and run by other teams because - to be honest - we can't vouch for others, and whether or not they would treat users well and allow you guys to post all the things you post here. (In other words, we don't always agree with the strictness or tone of some other subreddits, and didn't want to make you guys go to those, instead.)\n\nTo that end, we've come up with a solution of sorts.\n\nWe started r\/IconPasta long ago, for fandom-related posts about Jeff the Killer, BEN, Ticci Toby, and the rest.\n\nWe started r\/HorrorNarrations as well, for narrators to have a specific place that was \"just for them\" without being drowned out by a thousand other types of posts.\n\nSo, now, we're announcing r\/EyeScream for creepy, disturbing, and just plain \"weird\" images!\n\nAt r\/EyeScream, you can count on us to be just as hands-off, only interfering with posts when they break Reddit ToS or our very light rules. (No Gore, No Porn, etc.)\n\nWe hope you guys have fun being the first users there - this is your opportunity to help build and influence what r\/EyeScream is, and will become, for years to come!"},"2":{"title":"I Took a 30-Day Livestream Challenge for $100,000. I Don’t Think I’m the One Streaming Anymore.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kh4sf1\/i_took_a_30day_livestream_challenge_for_100000_i\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"pschyco147","selftext":" Day 1: The Beginning\n\nI received an offer from a company called GrinSignal: stream my life 24\/7 for 30 days, no breaks longer than 15 minutes, and earn $100,000. The rules were strict: no leaving the apartment, no turning off the stream, and no covering the cameras. Desperate for money, I accepted.\n\nDay 2: Settling In\n\nThe equipment arrived: multiple cameras, including ones for the bathroom and kitchen, all connected to a sleek, locked PC tower with no ports. I set everything up and went live. The first day was uneventful, just me going about my daily routine.\n\nDay 3: The Audience Grows\n\nViewership started to climb. Comments flooded in, some supportive, others curious about the setup. I noticed the cameras had a red light that blinked occasionally, even when I wasn't doing anything noteworthy.\n\nDay 4: Unusual Glitches\n\nThe stream began to glitch at odd times. Brief static, distorted audio, and occasional screen flickers. Viewers commented on it, thinking it was part of the show. I dismissed it as technical issues.\n\nDay 5: The Ceiling Camera\n\nI woke up to find a new camera angle on the stream: a view from the ceiling directly above my bed. I hadn't installed a camera there. I searched the ceiling but found nothing. The angle disappeared later that day.\n\nDay 6: Mirror Reflections\n\nThe bathroom mirror showed a delayed reflection. I'd move, and the reflection would follow a second later. Sometimes, it didn't move at all. I covered the mirror, but the stream showed it uncovered.\n\nDay 7: Sleep Disturbances\n\nI started having nightmares—vivid, unsettling dreams of being watched. I woke up feeling exhausted, despite sleeping for hours. Viewers noted that I talked in my sleep, saying things I couldn't remember.\n\nDay 8: Messages from Viewers\n\nI received messages from viewers claiming they saw someone else in the apartment during the stream. A shadowy figure in the background, always just out of focus. I reviewed the footage but saw nothing.\n\nDay 9: Time Loss\n\nI began losing track of time. I'd start a task and suddenly find hours had passed. The stream logs showed me sitting motionless, staring at the wall during these periods.\n\nDay 10: Unexplained Sounds\n\nI heard whispers at night, soft voices speaking in an unintelligible language. They seemed to come from the walls. I checked for any sources but found none.\n\nDay 11: Physical Changes\n\nI noticed bruises on my arms and legs that I couldn't explain. Viewers commented on them, speculating about their origin. I had no memory of injuring myself.\n\nDay 12: The Reflection Moves\n\nWhile brushing my teeth, I saw my reflection smile at me, even though I wasn't smiling. It winked and then returned to mirroring my actions. I left the bathroom in a panic.\n\nDay 13: Messages in the Stream\n\nThe stream displayed messages I hadn't typed: \"Let us in,\" \"We see you,\" \"Join us.\" I changed all my passwords, but the messages continued.\n\nDay 14: The Figure Appears\n\nViewers captured screenshots of a dark figure standing behind me during the stream. I never saw it in person, but the images were clear. It stood still, watching me.\n\nDay 15: Isolation\n\nI tried contacting friends and family, but my phone wouldn't connect. Emails went unanswered. It was as if I had been cut off from the outside world.\n\nDay 16: The Voice\n\nA voice began speaking to me through the headphones, whispering my name, recounting my thoughts before I had them. It knew things about me that I had never shared.\n\nDay 17: The Doppelgänger\n\nI saw myself on the stream, performing actions I wasn't doing—walking around the apartment, staring into the camera. I was sitting still, yet the stream showed me moving.\n\nDay 18: Physical Manifestations\n\nObjects moved on their own. Doors opened and closed without cause. The air grew colder, and I could see my breath despite the thermostat reading a normal temperature.\n\nDay 19: The Mirror Shatters\n\nThe bathroom mirror exploded without warning, sending glass in all directions. I stood frozen as the shards rained down. On the floor, they formed letters — jagged, blood-edged slivers spelling out: “HE’S ALMOST DONE.”\n\nI didn’t know who he was. But I was certain they weren’t talking about me.\n\nDay 20: Stream Delay\n\nI noticed a delay in the livestream — not seconds, but minutes. I’d move, and five minutes later, the stream would catch up. But sometimes, the stream showed things I hadn’t done yet — walking into rooms I hadn’t entered, talking to people who weren’t there.\n\nPeople in the comments said it felt like watching the future.\n\nDay 21: Losing Time\n\nI woke up in the kitchen, standing. My hands were soaked in something dark. I thought it was blood, but it smelled like ink. On the walls, phrases were scribbled again and again in frantic, looping handwriting:\n\n“WHO’S WATCHING WHO?”\n\n“STREAMED ENOUGH YET?”\n\n“THERE IS NO OFFLINE.”\n\nDay 22: No Sleep\n\nI stopped sleeping. Whenever I closed my eyes, I’d see the stream interface in my mind — hearts floating, usernames scrolling, camera feeds overlapping. I could hear the chat even without headphones.\n\nOne viewer typed: “We miss the old you.”\n\nAnother replied: “Wait for Day 30.”\n\nDay 23: The Feed Splits\n\nThe stream glitched and showed two live feeds side-by-side: one of me pacing in real-time… and one where I was lying in bed, eyes open, unmoving. Viewers called it “The Split.” They took sides. Some believed I was still real. Others said I’d been replaced.\n\nI started wondering which version of me I was.\n\nDay 24: Lights Out\n\nPower cut. Everything went pitch black. No electronics worked. But the stream continued. People commented on the darkness. Some said they could see me, even though I was in total blackness.\n\nA new user appeared in the chat with a red name: SYSWATCHER_01. Their only message: “Do not look behind you.”\n\nI looked. There was something tall and bent over the couch. Watching. Breathing.\n\nDay 25: I Am the Stream\n\nI no longer felt the need to eat or drink. The cameras turned toward me on their own, anticipating my movements. I tried covering one — the video showed me smiling as I did it, even though I was crying.\n\nThe chat filled with laughter. But not text. Audio. A chorus of distorted voices. My viewers were laughing out loud.\n\nDay 26: Visitors\n\nThere was knocking at the door. I ran to it. No one there. Then knocking from the inside of the bedroom closet. I opened it. Nothing.\n\nThen the stream showed someone still inside it, watching me from the dark.\n\nI screamed. The stream captioned it: “He sees you now.”\n\nDay 27: Outside Isn’t Real\n\nI smashed a window and tried to climb out. There was nothing beyond the glass — just static, like a broken TV screen. My hand dissolved at the edge. Not blood. Not bone. Just pixels.\n\nI pulled back and vomited code onto the floor. It blinked and dissolved.\n\nThe chat erupted:\n“Stay inside the broadcast.”\n“Don’t break character.”\n\nDay 28: Rehearsal\n\nI heard myself talking in the other room. Same voice. Same cadence. I walked in and found nothing. But on the feed, I was still in there. Practicing lines.\n\n\"They’re almost ready.\"\n\"He’s nearly perfect now.\"\n\nDay 29: System Update\n\nA prompt appeared on the stream overlay: “Update Complete. New Identity Installed.”\n\nI tried ending the stream. The button vanished. I tore the cameras from the walls — they regenerated. One by one.\n\nThe chat was full of only one phrase now:\n\n“YOU ARE LIVE FOREVER.”\n\nDay 30: The Final Viewer\n\nOnly one viewer remained. The chat was dead silent. I spoke directly to the camera.\n\n“Who are you?”\n\nThe reply typed itself out in red:\n\n“I’m the you that got out.”\n\nI stared into the lens. The camera stared back.\n\nAnd then… I watched as I stood up from the couch and walked away from the screen — toward freedom — while I remained seated, motionless, trapped in the lens.\n\nThe stream ended.\n\nFor them.\n\nBut I’m still here.\nStill live."},"3":{"title":"Being of Service","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kha9y7\/being_of_service\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"WittyisNotWitty","selftext":"TW:>! Self-Harm, Cannibalism, ingesting bodily fluids(Semen)!<\n\nThere’s something really quite special about serving someone a meal. There’s so much trust that you have in the person making your food. You have to have trust that they’ll follow procedure and make something safe and clean, but you also have to trust them to make something you’ll actually enjoy. Something that will make you grateful for being alive. \n\nMost people these days don’t seem to appreciate that the way we ought to. I’ll be honest, as a service provider working in the food industry, that fact really irks me sometimes. Especially when people treat me like I’m nothing. I mean, don’t they understand *what* they’re trusting me with? Making food for another human being is a *deeply* intimate process. They trust me with their source of life. Their *real* source of life, anyway. And I control it. At least for a single meal, I really do. I just wish they’d remember that sometimes. Is that really so much to ask?\n\nOf course, it’s not good for me to focus on the negative. It’s unprofessional, too. Always better to look on the bright side. For me, that bright side has a name, and a mouth. \n\nShe comes in every Friday. When she’s at the counter, she always has me write “Cell” down for her order, but I know that she’s really named Celeste. Like most of our other regulars, she always orders the same thing. Salad bowl with red onions and a steak. Medium rare. She always tips, too. I don’t think she ever remembers me, but she still smiles when she orders. Her smile has all the sunshine on planet earth, I think.\n\nThe first time it happened was an accident. I was preparing her order, cutting the onion into perfect little slices, when I nicked myself. Such a small cut, just barely able to squeeze a few drops of blood out of my body and into the food. We’re supposed to discard any compromised product and start from scratch in events like this. She trusted me to keep clean, after all. But, unfortunately, I had a line. My manager would’ve mounted my skull on his wall, you *gotta* understand; and it was only a few drops anyway, wasn’t it?\n\nAt least, that’s what I told myself. \n\nAnd she *loved it.*\n\n“Seriously, I’m not sure if the recipe changed or what, but that was really good!” It was just an offhand comment, something she said into her phone on her way out the door. But I’d swear she stole a glance towards me. I swear she did. \n\nI still vividly remember how my heart surged when I realized that. Celeste *looked* at me. She really saw my food, *saw me*, for the first time. The pounding flowed its way down my arm and into the tip of my finger. The cut was the conduit to my heart, and my satisfaction was delectable. It made every other rude customer that day worth it. \n\nBut, of course, that feeling didn’t last. And they wore down at my high. Like termites digging through wood, day after day. Everybody’s a critic, right?\n\n“It honestly doesn’t matter how much *effort* you put into the food, this isn’t exactly a high-end restaurant.” My supervisor would say. “We’re barely a step above fast food, just make the damn orders in a reasonable time. This is your last warning.” \n\n“I understand sir. I’ll do better.” Fucker thinks he can rush art. Nobody understands. Nobody appreciates it. Nobody thinks it *matters*. Nobody but Celeste, at least. \n\nThe next Friday she comes in, my hand shakes slightly as I write her order down. It’s hard to control nerves, especially when you're going to show someone a part of you. I made sure that it was perfect. Every chunk of lettuce, every slice of onion, and of course, the steak. The main course. Eventually, it’s time for the figurative cherry on top.\n\nAfter looking over my shoulder, a quick slice from my knife is all it takes. My thumb’s open, and a quick trickle across the cheap steak is all I do. I’m holding back, of course. There’s a power in subtlety, and I don’t want to be caught. She took my food, *her food*, and ate where she always did. \n\nThere wasn’t any indication of anything until after she was done eating. Then it happened. She looked toward the counter again, her lips curled into the slightest smirk. Anybody else would write it off, but I *know* it’s because of my food. Because of what I did. *She loved it.* It’s hard to contain my little hops of excitement until I make it into the storeroom. My thumbs' painful clotting is so, so worth it. \n\nSo we both enter into this little dance. Every time she comes in, I give her a little piece of myself. It was just my blood, at first, and the week-long wait made me itch for it every time. But soon, I realized that it was a gift. I had *days* of preparation. Soon I grew bolder. Blood. Saliva. Hair. Nail clippings. Semen. I was good at hiding it. Mixing myself into the meals just perfectly enough to make it near imperceptible. And nobody knew.\n\nExcept her, of course. \n\nAnyone else would call me psychotic. Anyone else would say that it’s all in my head, and write off her little mannerisms as just that. But I knew better. I could see how appreciative she was in her eyes. In her small, wise smirks. In the light, fluttery way she always said “*Thank you for the meal.*” I know she knew. I *know* she did. She liked it. God, it was everything. \n\nI don’t want people to think I’m a creep. I promise that I tried it with others, too. Even the rude customers. But it never quite felt the same. It almost felt like cheating. And they didn’t appreciate me. Only she did. I didn't have a choice, you know? I needed this.\n\nAt least, until I fucked it all up one week. I was finished with her order, and as I handed it to her she broke the routine. \n\n“Hey, I see you working here all the time. What’s your name?” I was filled with the supreme fear of God. \n\n“I’m very busy trying to take the orders of customers. Please have a good day.” \n\n“Oh, sorry.” And she was gone. Why did I say that? *Why did I fucking say that?* \n\nThe rest of the shift went by just fine. But when I got home that day I quietly took off my shoes, went into my kitchen and shattered every glass that I owned. Then, I went through my plates and broke every single one of them. Threw a few into the wall as hard as I could. Next was utensils. I bent every single one of them. Stabbed them into a hard counter to break them. By the end, my entire kitchen was trashed. \n\nAfter a long moment, I walked into my bathroom, careful to avoid the broken glass, and looked in the mirror. I didn’t understand why I was still angry with myself. Isn’t destruction supposed to feel cathartic? Isn’t it supposed to make me feel regretful? \n\nIt didn’t. I opened a drawer and picked out my razor. It’s one of the older, antique kinds, I had bought it because it reminded me of *Sweeney Todd*. My favorite musical. I played with the blade. My eyelid won’t stop twitching, and there’s an ache behind my ears. \n\n“*Oh, sorry.*”\n\nGod, how could I be so stupid? Why won’t my eyelid stop? Why does my head hurt so bad? I wanted to scream. I wanted to tear my eyes out. My knuckles are white around the blade. The ache is unbearable. Eventually I begin screaming. I lift the blade to my ear and begin to hack. I slash, and saw, and scream, until metallic wet begins to run down my neck and soak into my shirt. It hurts. It hurts so much. But it’s too late to stop.\n\nIt took minutes. It took longer than I thought it would, But, when I’m done there’s a severed ear in my sink. Floating in a small pool of blood. I open the drain, and watch the blood pool shrink away. It leaves a stain in the porcelain, but it doesn’t change anything. Liquid seeps down my back and into my waistband. It makes me shudder. Speckled bright drops on a pristine white countertop. The ear reminds me of something. The great painter Van Gogh. And then suddenly I know exactly how I’ll be able to make it right.\n\nWhen I come into work, my head wrapped in bandages, I get a few strange looks. I tell lies to the ones who ask and I wait for Friday. I’m giving her my ear. I’d give her my heart if I could. Fuck subtlety. When Friday comes, Celeste is there. Of course she is. She gives a strange glance towards my appearance, and orders what she always does. \n\nI chop the ear into little curved strips, and decorate her meal with them. Not even bothering to hide it. I hear a few curses and screams as I carefully lay myself across the salad. *Fuck subtlety.* My coworker who works the salad bar threw up when I walked by, but I still handed it to her with a grin from ear to ear. Or, well, *you know.*\n\n“It’s for you.” I say. She doesn’t answer. Her face filled with an emotion I can’t place, she hesitantly turns around and leaves. “Where are you going?” She's out the door. “*Where are you going?*” \n\nBut I know that she will never return. So I leave, too. I wasn’t really sure where I was going, but I knew I had to be gone before the police arrived. \n\nI couldn’t go back to my job, and I knew I couldn’t go back to my house, either. The police were likely hunting me now, so I spent the first few days hiding out on the outskirts of town. I changed my clothes, wore a hat to hide my injury, and bandages. I probably could’ve left town, but I just couldn’t stop thinking about Celeste. Why did she just leave? That dish was my magnum opus. \n\nA terrible thought came into my head eventually. Maybe it really *was* all in my head. Maybe she really had no clue of what I was doing. But that couldn’t be true, I saw how she looked at me. She *was* looking at me, right? But the longer I thought about it, the more it seemed like the truth. Why else would she refuse me at my best? The only reason she’d do that is if she *didn’t know* how much of myself was there, all along. If she didn't know, she didn’t care. \n\nShe was easy to track down, though. All it took was a phone book and a few commutes into the suburbs, and it wasn’t long until I had found out where she lived. She was as beautiful as ever, of course. A simple, perfect routine. Alphabetical beauty products behind her bathroom mirror. Spotless closet. Even her trash seemed *refined.* \n\nI wanted to be subtle, like before. Because subtlety shows control. It shows artistic intent. It’s sexy. But it’s clear now that Celeste isn’t the type of person that I thought she was. She wasn’t one to appreciate subtleties. I *poured* myself into those dishes, and she had the audacity to not even *realize* that? I don’t care if she knew or not, honestly. She was stringing me along. I deserved compensation for that *alone.* I deserved to have her the way that she had me. Whether she liked it or not.\n\nCeleste doesn’t lock her windows at night. If I were her, I probably would. The police are still looking for “*anyone with any information on my whereabouts*,” after all. I entered her home through her kitchen, the same way I had the first few times. But this time was different. I took a long blade from her knife block, and solemnly moved towards her room. Like a soldier. Like a customer waiting to feed. She was down the hall, and after creaking a door open, I saw her. \n\nCeleste was asleep in her bed. Limbs all splayed out, mouth hanging open. For just a moment, I hesitated. She looked so innocent. Nobody would’ve known how much of a heartbreaker she was, if they saw her like this. It made me want her even more. I stood above her and raised the knife. Her eyes fluttered open. \n\n“It’s *you!*” I bring the knife down, and suddenly I’m on my back, across the room. The knife has clattered to the ground, and I can’t breathe. “Oh, my gosh, sorry! You startled me, *haha!*” When I finally catch my breath, I sit up, and realize what happened. \n\n“You… hit me?” \n\n“Sorry! Won’t happen again, oh, and sorry that I didn’t eat your ear. It was just public, and a big step up that I wasn’t expecting-“ \n\n“Wait. You *knew?*” She smiled as I staggered to my feet. How did she hit me so hard? \n\n“Of course I knew.” This changes things, doesn’t it? I thought that I would be happy. But I didn’t feel happy. “Well, are you ready?” \n\n“Ready for what?” And Celeste winks at me. Flashing another bright, toothy smile. Too toothy. Rows of serration. Then her jaw unhinges, as her canines grow into long hooks. She's growing, too. Skin splitting against bulging muscle. \n\n“Well, I’m ready for your last dish. Are you?” Celeste rasps, taking a thudding step towards me. What *is* she? \n\n“Please- Please don’t hurt me.” My voice is breaking. Celeste, or what I thought was Celeste, studies me.\n\n“Isn’t this what you wanted? Isn’t this what you wanted me to do?” \n\n“It was supposed to be my turn. I thought that you were… I thought that-“ \n\n“That you had power over me? That I was just a normal customer? *Haha!*” Her eyes pierce through me. “You’re so pathetic, you know that? Did you really think that you were entitled to me, just because you shared yourself? You make me want to throw you up.” \n\n“You- you *hit* *me!*” I realize that I’m crying. I realize that I was *never* the one in control. That I was nothing without her interest. She bares her teeth and snarls. \n\n“What’s wrong, chef? *Bite off more than you could chew?*” And she lunges. My cries are drowned out by tearing flesh. "},"4":{"title":"The Happiest Place on Earth","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1khec6u\/the_happiest_place_on_earth\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Ancient_Baseball_752","selftext":"Ethan had always dreamed of working at Disney World. As a child, he spent countless summers wandering the park, losing himself in the magic and wonder of it all. The vibrant colors, the laughter of children, the enchanting music—it was a world where dreams came true. So, when he finally received the job offer to work as a custodian at the park, he felt like he had won the lottery. He could hardly contain his excitement as he packed his belongings and moved to Orlando, ready to begin his new adventure.\n\n\n\nOn his first day, the sun hung high in the sky, casting a golden light over the park. Ethan donned his crisp, clean uniform and headed to the staff area for orientation. The room was filled with other new hires, all buzzing with enthusiasm. The manager, a stern-looking woman named Ms. Kelly, welcomed them with a rehearsed speech. As she spoke, Ethan’s eyes wandered around the room, taking in the walls adorned with Disney memorabilia. It felt like a dream.\n\n\n\nAfter the orientation, Ethan was assigned to his post near the entrance of Fantasyland. As he swept the pavement, he couldn’t help but smile at the families passing by, their faces illuminated with joy. But as the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the park, he noticed a figure lingering near the edge of the trees. It was a man, dressed in a tattered costume resembling a character from the park, but his eyes were hollow, devoid of life.\n\n\n\nEthan felt an inexplicable chill run down his spine. The man approached him slowly, a crooked smile stretching across his face. “You’re new here, aren’t you?” he rasped, his voice low and gravelly.\n\n\n\n“Yeah, just started today,” Ethan replied, trying to sound casual, but unease twisted in his stomach.\n\n\n\nThe man leaned in closer, lowering his voice. “You should read the note.” With that, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper, handing it to Ethan. “The rules. They’ll keep you safe.”\n\n\n\nEthan hesitated but took the note, his curiosity piqued. The man’s smile widened, revealing yellowed teeth. “Trust me. You’ll need them.”\n\n\n\nAs the man shuffled away, Ethan unfolded the note, his heart pounding. The rules were written in a hurried scrawl, the ink smudged and faded. They read:\n\n\n\nNever be alone after dark. The park changes when the sun sets.\n\nAvoid the unused attractions. They hold memories best left forgotten.\n\nIf you hear laughter that isn’t from children, run.\n\nDo not speak to the characters after hours. They are not what they seem.\n\nIf you see a door that shouldn’t be there, do not open it. It leads to their world.\n\nEthan’s blood ran cold as he read the final line. He glanced around, half-expecting to see the man watching him, but he was gone. Dismissing the note as a prank, he shoved it into his pocket, though the uneasiness lingered.\n\n\n\nThat night, after his shift ended, Ethan walked through the park, the lights twinkling like stars against the night sky. The laughter of children echoed in the distance, but as he wandered deeper into the park, the sounds began to fade, replaced by an unsettling silence. The shadows lengthened, and the once-cheerful atmosphere turned oppressive.\n\n\n\nRemembering the note, he glanced at his watch. It was nearly closing time. He should head back, but something tugged at him—a curiosity, a desire to explore the park when it was quiet. He stepped towards an old attraction, “The Enchanted Tiki Room,” which had been closed for renovations for years. Its entrance was shrouded in darkness, and a flickering light beckoned him inside.\n\n\n\nAs he crossed the threshold, an icy breeze enveloped him. The air was thick with dust, and the cheerful animatronic birds that once sang were now silent, their eyes seemingly watching him. Ethan’s heart raced as he moved deeper into the attraction, his footsteps echoing in the hollow space.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, he heard it—a soft, tinkling laugh that sent shivers down his spine. It was not the laughter of children. Panic surged through him as he remembered the rule. He turned to leave, but the exit had vanished, replaced by a wall of darkness. The laughter grew louder, and he felt an overwhelming sense of dread.\n\n\n\n“Ethan,” a voice called softly, sweetly, echoing through the room. It was a voice he recognized, one he had heard countless times in the park. “Stay and play with us.”\n\n\n\nHe spun around, and in the dim light, he saw the figures of the beloved characters—Mickey, Minnie, and others—standing in a circle, their eyes wide and glistening, but their smiles were wrong, twisted. “We’ve been waiting for you,” Mickey said, his voice distorted, the cheerful tone replaced by something sinister.\n\n\n\nEthan stumbled back, his heart racing. He remembered the note and the warning about the characters. “No! You’re not real!” he shouted, feeling the walls close in around him.\n\n\n\nThe characters stepped closer, their movements unnaturally fluid, as if they were gliding rather than walking. “We are as real as your dreams, Ethan,” Minnie cooed, her smile stretching impossibly wide. “You wanted to be part of the magic, didn’t you?”\n\n\n\nEthan turned and ran, the darkness swallowing him whole. He dashed through the attraction, desperately searching for an exit, but every door he reached led him back into the heart of the nightmare. The laughter echoed, mocking him, taunting him.\n\n\n\nFinally, he stumbled upon a door that stood slightly ajar, a sliver of light spilling out. Without thinking, he pushed it open and stepped through, only to find himself in a dimly lit corridor lined with mirrors. He looked around, his reflection staring back at him, but the reflections weren’t his own. They were distorted versions of himself, grinning and leering, their eyes filled with malice.\n\n\n\n“Join us, Ethan,” they whispered, their voices a chorus of temptation. “You can be one of us.”\n\n\n\nHe shook his head violently, backing away. “No! I want to leave!” he screamed, but the mirrors began to ripple, and he felt himself being pulled toward them, as if they were alive, hungry for him.\n\n\n\nIn a moment of desperation, he remembered the final rule. “If you see a door that shouldn’t be there, do not open it.” With all his strength, he turned away from the mirrors and sprinted down the corridor, the laughter growing fainter behind him.\n\n\n\nHe burst through another door, this one leading outside. The night air hit him like a wave, and he found himself in a deserted part of the park. The moon hung high, illuminating the path back to the entrance. He ran, heart pounding, fear propelling him forward.\n\n\n\nAs he neared the gates, he glanced back, half-expecting to see the characters chasing him. But the park was silent, the once vibrant colors now muted under the moonlight. He dashed through the gates, collapsing onto the pavement outside, gasping for breath.\n\n\n\nEthan never returned to Disney World. The magic he had longed for was tainted, transformed into a nightmare that would haunt him forever. He kept the note folded in his wallet as a grim reminder of the rules he had broken. But deep down, he knew that the park still waited for him, the laughter echoing in the shadows, always ready to welcome him back into its embrace. He could almost hear the whispers calling his name, promising him the magic he once desired.\n\n\n\nAnd as the years passed, he would often wake in the night, drenched in sweat, the laughter still echoing in his mind, a chilling reminder that some dreams should never come true.\n\n\n\n"},"5":{"title":"Cannot for the life of me remember the title of this story!!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kh28sm\/cannot_for_the_life_of_me_remember_the_title_of\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Beautiful-Rooster-64","selftext":"Story is about a young boy in maybe middle school, who has to run home every day to avoid bullies, when he passes this supposedly empty house, which it actually has a lottle girl and her mother and her grandmother living there, no men, and the little girl tries to befriend the young man, and the little girl is names Rose, I think, and the mother grandmother freaks out when the little girl let's the boy inside only one time, and the boy is chased down by the biggest bully in the end, and the little girls grandmother's roses end up saving the young boy from the bully by eating the bully in the end"},"6":{"title":"The Elevator Attendant.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1khg1b9\/the_elevator_attendant\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Huckleberry-Obvious","selftext":"They said the job would be easy.  \nOne form, one ID check, one elevator.

The vendor, an old man with wild white hair and a toothless grin, had warned him with an unsettling glint in his eye. “This game has rules, boy. Follow them, or the game will follow you.”\n\n\n\nEthan laughed it off, dismissing the old man as just another eccentric. He loved video games—especially retro ones. The thrill of nostalgia washed over him as he slid the cartridge into his ancient console, the familiar start-up jingle echoing through his room. He felt a rush of excitement as he selected his file, ready to relive the adventures of Mario and Luigi.\n\n\n\nBut as he began to play, the screen flickered, and a strange message appeared in pixelated letters: “Welcome to the game. Remember the rules.”\n\n\n\nEthan furrowed his brow. He had never seen anything like this before. He pressed a button, and the message vanished, replaced by the cheerful music of the game. He shrugged it off, attributing it to a glitch. Little did he know, the rules were not just a gimmick—they were a warning.\n\n\n\nAs he played, he began to notice peculiarities. The levels seemed different, more sinister. The cheerful Koopa Troopas wore twisted grins, and the once-harmless Goombas moved with an uncanny speed. Ethan’s heart raced, but he pressed on, determined to conquer the game.\n\n\n\nAfter a few levels, the message reappeared, this time more ominous: “Rule 1: Never pause the game while in a castle.” Ethan, bemused, continued playing, dismissing it as a silly instruction. He paused to take a sip of soda, and the screen went black.\n\n\n\n“Ethan…” a voice whispered, echoing through the room. He froze, heart pounding. The voice was not from the game; it was real. He looked around, but his room was empty. Shaking off the dread, he resumed playing, only to find himself in a castle level.\n\n\n\nAs he navigated through the treacherous halls, the message flashed again: “Rule 2: Do not collect the glowing mushrooms.” Ethan, intrigued, saw a shimmering mushroom floating in the air. He reached for it without thinking. The moment he touched it, the screen glitched violently, and he was plunged into darkness.\n\n\n\n“Welcome to your nightmare,” the voice hissed, and for a moment, he felt a cold breath on the back of his neck. He spun around, but no one was there.\n\n\n\nEthan’s fingers trembled as he resumed the game, now fully aware that something was off. The cheerful music had warped into a haunting melody, and the once-bright colors faded into a grayscale nightmare. He pressed on, desperate to escape this twisted version of his childhood.\n\n\n\n“Rule 3: Do not let the timer run out,” the message warned. Ethan felt a chill creep down his spine. Panic set in as the timer began to count down. He raced through the level, dodging enemies that seemed to leer at him with malicious intent. The timer ticked down, and just as it hit zero, the screen flashed red.\n\n\n\n“Game Over,” it taunted, but the voice returned, now a guttural growl. “You have failed.”\n\n\n\nEthan’s heart raced as the room darkened. Shadows danced along the walls, and he could hear faint whispers echoing from the game. “You must follow the rules, or you will be trapped here forever.”\n\n\n\nDesperation clawed at him. He needed to finish the game, to escape the horror that was unfolding. He pressed start again, determined to adhere to the rules.\n\n\n\n“Rule 4: Do not look away from the screen.”\n\n\n\nEthan clenched his jaw. The pressure was mounting, sweat beading on his forehead as he fought to keep his eyes glued to the screen. Each level was more nightmarish than the last. The enemies grew more aggressive, and the landscapes morphed into grotesque versions of his childhood memories.\n\n\n\n“Rule 5: Do not speak while playing.”\n\n\n\nHe bit his lip, stifling the urge to cry out. The game had become a living entity, and he could feel its malevolence seeping into his reality. As he reached the final level, the screen flickered violently, and the message appeared again.\n\n\n\n“Rule 6: If you die, you must turn off the console immediately.”\n\n\n\nWith every fiber of his being, he fought against the urge to scream as he faced Bowser, who had transformed into a monstrous version of himself, with glowing eyes and jagged teeth. The battle was brutal, and just as Ethan thought he had won, Bowser unleashed a devastating attack, and Ethan’s character fell.\n\n\n\n“Turn it off!” the voice echoed, but Ethan was paralyzed with fear. The screen pulsed like a heartbeat, and he felt a cold hand grip his shoulder.\n\n\n\n“Rule 7: Do not look behind you.”\n\n\n\nHe felt the warmth of breath against his ear, and the whispers grew louder. “You’re mine now, Ethan.”\n\n\n\nWith a surge of adrenaline, he finally yanked the power cord from the wall. The room fell silent, the game’s menacing voice fading into the void. He gasped for air, heart racing, but the relief was short-lived.\n\n\n\nThe game had not ended; it had merely paused. The screen flickered back to life, and the message returned, more sinister than ever. “You cannot escape. You are part of the game now.”\n\n\n\nEthan’s eyes widened in horror as he realized the truth. The rules were not just a part of the game; they were a binding contract. He had been drawn into a twisted reality where he was both player and pawn.\n\n\n\n“Rule 8: You must finish the game to break the curse.”\n\n\n\nHe felt the shadows closing in, the whispers echoing in his mind. He had to play again, to confront Bowser, to end this nightmare once and for all.\n\n\n\nWith trembling hands, he powered on the console once more. The game resumed, but the stakes were higher, the rules more terrifying.\n\n\n\n“Rule 9: You will lose everything if you fail.”\n\n\n\nAs he fought his way through the levels, he felt his grip on reality slipping. Each enemy he defeated seemed to drain a piece of his soul, and the shadows in his room grew darker, more oppressive.\n\n\n\nFinally, he faced Bowser again, but this time, the monster was not just a character on the screen; it was a manifestation of his fears, his regrets. The battle raged on, and just as he thought he would lose again, he remembered the final rule.\n\n\n\n“Rule 10: If you win, you must never play again.”\n\n\n\nWith a final surge of determination, he unleashed a powerful attack, and Bowser roared in defeat, the screen flashing with victory. But as the game ended, the room trembled, and the shadows surged forward, enveloping him.\n\n\n\nEthan gasped, realizing the truth. Winning had not freed him; it had sealed his fate. The game had claimed him, and he was now trapped in the pixelated nightmare, forever bound by the ten rules of Mario’s curse.\n\n\n\nAs the screen flickered one last time, the message appeared, a chilling reminder of his fate: “Welcome to your new reality, Ethan. Game Over.”\n\n\n\n"},"9":{"title":"A discussion of JTK fangirls\/simps","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1khcsrh\/a_discussion_of_jtk_fangirlssimps\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Mother_Dakota","selftext":"Hey guys, I’m Mother Dakota and this discussion post is about\nYou guessed it Jeff the killer.

When the smell of rot and iron fills the air, and the children hear a raspy voice from the woods calling to them, “Closer, child, you don’t have to be alone.” That’s when the tale of the starving fox creeps its way back into people's memories once again.  \n\n\n\nFarmers speak of a fox whose ribcage resembles sickles poking through thin fabric. A fox whose hunger can never be satiated, always on the brink of starvation. A fox that’s calculated and picks its prey carefully.\n\n\n\nThe fox’s hollow eyes lurk in the woods, observing the trails where children play. The farmers say that even in its famished state, it remains a sly fox. It lures children into the woods and breaks into chicken coops. All meat is the same to the starving fox. \n\n\n\nHowever, meat does not put an end to its hunger, and the prey’s blood turns to dust in its mouth. The fox knows its fate, forever in pain. But it is a fox, and foxes hunt. One particular prey fulfills the hunting desires more than others.\n\n\n\nThe tale of the starving fox has disappeared and reappeared several times. But what has remained is an ever-adapting poem that old farmers still mutter to themselves as they work and pray that their chickens will be safe for the night.\n\n\n\n“With its broken jaw and tongue of bone \n\nThe fox feasts on the fat of children and \n\nLater, grins by their gravestone.\n\n\n\nA fading figure, vile and forever famished\n\nEven God saw the thing and made it banished\n\nBe careful, children, stay close to your parents\n\nOr else maybe you will be the next one they say vanished\n\n\n\nWith a rotten grin\n\nAnd skin so thin\n\nYou can run, you can make haste\n\nBut the starving fox will find you, and seal your fate”\n\n"},"11":{"title":"I got a notification that I Just Died, But I'm still here","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kgndu4\/i_got_a_notification_that_i_just_died_but_im\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Available_Bad9872","selftext":"\n\n\n\nMy phone buzzed at 3:17 AM: “You have passed away.

The uneasy feeling of the day never went away, not even after fictionalizing my post. \n\nThe night before I had had a pretty strange and creepy dream. I woke up unsettled and with a sleep paralysis demon’s foot on my chest as I struggled to wake up. It was a slow work day and the only way I could  make the time pass was by posting on reddit. Like the good redditor I was, I embellished the story quite heavily and made myself the hero of an epic tale. Instead of just a lonely bystander in my own story like always. \n\nThe first ping from my phone told me to check the posts. “No comments?” I was confused as I checked my notifications. I had 14 unread DMs all saying the same thing. “How did you find a gun?” \n\nIn my story I had posted that I found a gun and fought off the demon, forcing it back into the underworld. \n\nMore and more DMs came in to my box. Most were the same thing. “Was that a lie? Did you really fight him off?” Or some variation on that theme. There were a few which truly terrified me. “How did we both see the same thing.” Or “AM I STILL DREAMING!? How did you see him too?”\n\nThat face entered my mind again. That creepy face which haunted me for the few seconds of eternity that was my morning sleep paralysis. I pushed it aside and opened up discord to distract myself. I saw the red bubble. \n\nOne of my friends had read my creepy story and DMed me saying he saw the same thing. He was freaking out too as he knew of one other person who had the same experience. \n\nIt was close to my lunch so I whipped up a discord server real quick and invited everyone who DMed me to it. I posted the real experience of my dream on the server and told everyone to reply if theirs differed. \n\nIt was all mostly the same with minor variations. Outside of my dream fighting him off, I had basically the same dream as everyone else. I watched in horror as this little discord quickly grew to over 400 people. A feat I would normally be proud of, but could only fear as my heart pounded in my chest. \n\nMy work fell by the wayside as my mind was intently glued on that discord channel. Every conversation, every email, and every notification was secondary to discord blips. Then the picture came through. I visibly recoiled back as an artist decided to draw the image she saw in her dream. It was a perfect representation of the being that haunted me. \n\n\nI need to be clear here. The thing from our dream was just a man. A very creepy, unsettling man who’s smile and indistinct features shook me to my very soul.  \n\nI looked over my desk and saw two coworkers with the same shocked and horrified expressions on their faces. I waited for them to look over at me. It felt like an eternity. They both eventually did look over and we shared the same unspoken agreement. \n\nWe jumped into a private chat in teams as we explained in full detail the weird dream. \n\nBefore the sleep paralysis demon phase, our dreams were all different. I was a delivery driver who was dodging bullets in a warzone to get valuable supplies to troops. Which, because it was my dream, were ps5s and video games. \n\nMy co-worker was trying to get to a party but kept getting blocked by her little brothers and sisters. Her brothers and sisters are in their 20s now but in the dream they were small. I could recognize this kind of dream all over. We have all had the kind of dream where you desperately want to have fun and constantly get road blocked by anything and everything. She said one of the road blocks for her was an actual alien invasion she had to fight off. She got to the party as it ended and “woke up” to the sleep paralysis phase. \n\nThe second coworker did not have a dream. He thought he woke up to an invader in his home. \n\nOur collective dream was the same. We all woke up in our own beds alone with a creepy man putting his foot on our chest. His clothes were same-ish depending on who it was. Some saw him in logo-less black t-shirt and jeans. Some saw him in business attire. Some saw him wearing the kind of jump suits you would expect a painter or mechanic to wear. \n\nBut the face. To state that his face was unspecific, vague, imprecise, or generally just indistinct was an understatement. It was as if you asked AI to make a face of a man in his 20s who was an amalgamation of every move extra of a white male in his 20s. Only the features were not fully there. The eyes, nose, and ears all looked unfinished. LIke an old video game where the CGI was just good enough. Yet this was a “real” person. \n\nHis smile was unsettling as he stared down at us. “Too many teeth.” and “He wasn’t breathing.” Were how some of the discord people described him. \n\nThe man would stare down, not moving, not breathing, and saying nothing. Just standing there with his boot on your chest until you actually woke up. Except for mine. \n\nPart of the way through the dream I realized it was a dream, or at least I thought it was. So I grabbed my gun. I keep a quick release fingerprint safe within arms reach of me in my bed. I suddenly found the strength to move and grabbed it. On pure adrenaline and reflex I pointed and fired. That’s when I woke up. \n\nEveryone else was similar in their telling, only they were all helpless…except for a few of the DMs I received in discord. “I was able to lucid dream as well.” This guy was a drug addict and had used. He may not have fully fallen asleep and entered a trancelike state. According to him at least. He grabbed a needle and stuck the demon, what we called him in the discord, with it. \n\nThe other one of note came from an FBI agent. Same thing, same unimportant dream until the sleep paralysis. He said his mind refused to believe what was happening and just took over. He stood up in his bed, materialized clothes on his body and the demon just nodded to him. He awoke normally and thought nothing of it until he read my reddit post. \n\nNo one else in the discord had any variations of note. \n\nJust as a side note. Not really important to the story but figured I would share it here. The discord server in question had no trolling. No funny gifs. No raging A-holes. Usually when you put 400, 3000 now, gamers into one place you have to cull the herd. Have to assign moderators. But it was all the same. Everyone was working on solving this. Again if this were any other situation I would be the most proud person in the world. \n\nI finished out the day feeling…well not better but certainly not as bad. I felt like we were taking control with this discussion. \n\nI drove home, played video games, ate pizza, and regularly checked back on the discord. Same stories. We had so many of the same thing, with minor variables, that we simply had a checkmark, and X reaction voting system to each of the main variations. We had a channel setup to post your own variation, but most of the variations were minor. The guy had a tuft of hair sticking up, another saw him shirtless. \n\nIn the end I was seriously debating handing the server over and forgetting about the whole thing as the interest had turned into an obsession. \n\nI told myself I would wait for tomorrow and turned in for the day. \n\nThis morning he appeared again. His face seemed slightly more distinct, his clothes slightly more obvious, and his smile was the same. Knowing it was a dream I reached over to my safe to find it empty. Pure dread overtook me as I looked back up to see him pointing the barrel right at my forehead. \n\n“Not today.” \n\nThe voice was wrong. Like someone was trying to mimic a human voice. Almost like a parrot, but deeper. Before I could think any further over the voice, his smile widened as he pulled the trigger. \n\nI woke up covered in sweat and reached for my forehead. Nothing there. I calmed myself down by checking myself over. No damage anywhere. “OK… Weird but I am ok.” I swung my legs over the side of my bed and felt the same dread from my dream. \n\nOn my nightstand was my pistol. I was certain I put it up yesterday. I even checked the mag and chamber yesterday to make sure I did not fire it. \n\nMy hands shook as I reached for it. Uncertainty and fear overtook my imagination as I pulled the mag out and manually counted the bullets. Fifteen were still in the mag and the sixteenth was still in the chamber. \n\nI heaved a sigh of relief and put my gun away in its safe. “OK… Maybe I forgot to put it away.” I told myself. More trying to convince myself. \n\nLooking at the clock I realized I needed to get moving. I went into the bathroom for my normal morning routine and decided to check myself over in the mirror. Nothing. No damage, no red marks, no scratches or new cuts. Laughing it off I rubbed the spot on my forehead where the demon had shot me in my dream. \n\nAnd it hurt."},"13":{"title":"The Reflection","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kh36ne\/the_reflection\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Available_Bad9872","selftext":"It started when my reflection didn’t copy me—it watched me.\n\n\nAt first, it was subtle.\nI’d raise my hand, and it would follow—a split-second too late.\nI’d yawn, and it’d smirk.\n\nI laughed it off.

They led to a shallow crater filled with thick, rust-colored mud.\n\nIt was breathing.\n\nWe didn’t tell command. We lied. Said he deserted. But I found his helmet this morning — wedged into the wall of the trench.

I would spend many nights surfing the web, playing flash games, indulging into the hobbies of nerdom that fascinated me, and even occasionally reading creepy stories. It was in one of these creepy threads that I discovered crawl.jpg.\n\nIt was one of those cheesy cursed objects lists that had ads on every other page and was mostly all the most obvious and popular stories. This one though was 10 secret internet legends, and it's one I had never seen. I looked through each story and didn't find many that were interesting except one, number 7 I believe. It was labeled \"Trapped. Do Not Open\". The story described a young man that had summoned a demon with candles, pentagram, the whole bit. He supposedly conjured the entity and wanted to capture the creature on camera. He took a quick photo of what he thought was the demon and then saved it to his computer. The photo was uploaded to a 4chan discussion forum as his one and only post, titled crawl.jpg.\n\nMany downloaded the photo and were horrified at what they saw. I can hardly describe it now despite each pixel igniting my brain like a wildfire. It was blurry, out of focus, but wrong. It was a dark room with a small twin bed, the sheets all tossed around the room. A dark circle looked to be carved into the wood floor of the room and in the back against the plain white walls was a window open and curtains dark navy blue and pulled back.\n\nMostly it was a normal bedroom not unlike the one I had at the time but a little off and gave me the worst feeling in the pit of my stomach. There was a disturbing shift in the light not blue or green but somewhere between and there were two figures in the darkness of the room. They were almost hidden and I missed them at first glance. One was a tall humanoid in the corner of the room as black as shadow. The body was frail and emaciated, almost skeletal. It hovered a foot or so off of the floor and it cocked it's unnatural head to the side. There was no discernable expression on its face in the darkness but by the look of it's faint white eyes it seemed like it would be smiling. But that's not the one that bothers me the most. The other one I can't quite get out of my head. On the other side of the room where the bed sits on a frail thin metal frame was another entity. Not much was visible and I think if I saw more I wouldn't be here to write this. I could see a crooked broken human leg jutting out from behind the bed, and connected to it crawling into the small space beneath the bed was a monstrosity unlike anything of this world. I can only assume that this being was once human and some research and other accounts I have found concluded that this might actually be the person who uploaded the original picture. \n\nConnected to the mangled appendage was a grotesque worm-like body full of boils and sores. There were two arachnid-like legs that broke through the skin partially and dragged the ground behind it. The creature was pulling itself underneath the bed. The first viewing of this creature turned my stomach and just thinking about it makes me nauseous. After reading other posts on the image I discovered more disturbing details.  What I thought were only distressed skin and sores were actually what look like eyes just waking up from a long sleep. There were maybe 10-20 visible in the image. Also many have examined the image with various photo editors and revealed that there are large stains, probably blood, around the circle carved into the floor and worse… There are three more figures standing right outside looking into the window. Not much is visible but enhancing the lighting reveals three more unnerving smiling faces just like the one in the corner.\n\nThose who saw the picture had serious mental struggles immediately after and many apparently committed suicide. I believe I still haven't processed it fully yet and perhaps reading this after I finish writing will help with that. Since I saw the image I have had night terrors and sleep paralysis unlike anything I've experienced before. I see the faces in my window, the man standing in the corner of my room and odd noises and whispers throughout the night. The worst part though is as each night comes I get these pains in my side like someone cutting me from the inside. I can feel things moving beneath my skin. It feels like something is living inside of me. I go to look in the mirror and there are no marks or any signs of irritation. It's been only three days and I feel like I'm beginning to lose my sanity. Recently I've been hearing a faint hissing sound but not from any one direction but as if it's coming from inside my head... I don't have much time… I know he's watching me. Waiting to get whatever the monster is living inside me. He put this thing in me. I see him now. He's always smiling. There's nothing I can do. I already carved the circle and I'm going to my hiding place under the bed…\n\n\n He won't find me there...\n\n[crawl.jpg](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/xYSkKCu)\n\n\n\n\n"},"16":{"title":"Looking for Insight into My Recurring Dream?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kgz40p\/looking_for_insight_into_my_recurring_dream\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Eastern_Ad7411","selftext":"\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI’ve been dealing with insomnia for years, and recently I’ve started having a recurring dream that’s been really unsettling for me. I’ve tried just about everything to manage my insomnia—pills, meditation, you name it—but nothing has helped. \n\nFor the past few weeks, the dream has been more frequent and quite strange. In the dream, I find myself in a stark white room filled with people sitting in chairs, all facing the front. I’m in the back of the room, just sitting quietly. At first, I don’t say anything, but when I eventually manage to break the silence and say “hi,” it feels super awkward. Suddenly, everyone starts turning toward me in an eerie, creepy way, and then I always wake up, drenched in sweat—not scared, but definitely uncomfortable.\n\nWhat’s even odder is that this dream doesn’t restart when I go back to sleep; instead, it picks up exactly where I left off. In the most recent version, the people have stood up and are hovering over me, but their faces are completely featureless. I can tell they’re human, but they have no distinct features whatsoever.\n\nI’m really trying to understand what this might mean, and I’d love to hear if anyone has any insights or interpretations.

When she asked the landlord about it, he quickly brushed it off with a mumbled, “Old locks, nothing to worry about.”\n\nThen strange things started happening. Lique would wake up to the washer running — but empty. Rashad swore he heard soft footsteps below them when they were in bed. Once, their dog refused to go down there and just growled at the basement door all night.\n\nThings escalated fast.\n\nRashad came home early from work one afternoon to find the basement door wide open. Thinking Lique was down there, he called out. No answer. So he went down… and found nothing but the flickering laundry light and a strange, metallic smell in the air.\n\nLater that night, Lique told him she had been out all day.\n\nThey finally decided to set up a camera near the basement stairs, half-laughing about it, half-not.

The landlord thought he was gone when the place was cleaned out.\n\nBut when police searched the crawlspace, it was empty again. Just a small mattress. A bag of raw meat.

Well, I am one of the few people that still knows about it, and I'm sick and tired of holding my tongue.\n\nMy name is not important, but for the sake of fluidity, I'll go by John.\n\nIn the fall of 1979, I, along with a small group of friends, spent a long, drunken weekend planning our trip to Key West for the summer of 1980.\n\nMarco, my best friend, had us out to his house one weekend a month for a two-day bender of Cuban premium cigars, cheap whiskey, and pizza—a tradition that lasted in our little group for almost 10 years. We would play poker, darts, and billiards from sunup to sundown.\n\nThere were six of us in our group. We had all gone to high school together and managed to stay friends despite some wildly different post-high school paths.\n\nDanny was the jock of the group. He played semi-pro football up in Canada for 3 years after we graduated high school. His claim to fame was that he led our high school varsity team to the state championship twice, winning it all in our senior year. He was a monster of a guy, standing 6'6\" and weighing over two hundred and fifty pounds.\n\nJeff was the jack of all trades. He was always working on some redneck engineering project in his parents' garage, tearing apart small motorcycles and lawn mowers to produce awe-inspiring creations.\n\nHe earned himself quite the suspension our 11th grade year after the school superintendent found his beloved Mercury Grand Marquis in the teachers' parking lot with its wheels replaced with small lawn mower tires.\n\nJeff was a tall and skinny guy; however, what he lacked in raw strength, he easily made up for in MacGyver-like wit.\n\nTim and Jim were twin brothers that constantly found themselves knee-deep in sibling dispute. They were quick to throw punches at each other when either felt they were being slighted.\n\nThe brothers were high school slackers and never ceased to play the part of class clowns. The tricks the boys pulled on Mrs. Pfeiffer are still talked about to this very day.\n\nThe twins, however, did find themselves in a little bit of hot water after we graduated. Tim was at the local bar playing pool with Billy Tompkins' lady when Bill and a few of his brothers showed up hotter than hell looking for a brawl, and a brawl is what they got.\n\nTim and Jim supposedly went back-to-back in the small bar throwing haymakers and elbows. Although they fought like crazy, they got the worst of the physical damage. Jim found himself with two broken fingers and 3 cracked ribs while Tim earned a broken nose.\n\nThe boys thought they were in the clear when they shook hands with Billy after the fight had finished. Unfortunately, the bar owner decided to press charges for the broken pool table and the tipped-over jukebox.\n\nTim and Jim spent 4 months locked in Fox County Correctional for destruction of private property.\n\nMy best friend Marco was like the brother I never had. He and I would spend almost every single day of our fleeting youth together.\n\nMarco came from a middle-class family that worked their asses off to send him to a good college. He was always a good student, and honestly, oftentimes he would let me cheat off of his schoolwork so I could pass the classes I never bothered to study for.\n\nMarco was lucky to avoid the draft along with my other friends. It certainly helped that the war was winding down.\n\nMarco's father was a banker; he always wanted his son to do the same. Marco, however, had no interest at all. When he informed his parents that he was going to forego business school for a cross-country road trip in a Volkswagen bus with a couple of flower power hippies, they were inconsolable.\n\nMarco had spent his entire childhood being a \"goody two-shoes\" and needed a change. I recall asking him if he was sure about his choice, and he said, \"Listen, brother, I have spent 17 years being who everyone else wanted me to be. It's time I find out who I really am.\"\n\nWhile I found his sentiment a little far out there for me, I understood that he was always cooped up and needed a change of scenery.\n\nThen there's me. I had decided at a young age to follow in the footsteps of my father and his father. I joined the United States Marine Corps.\n\nI served just under a year in Vietnam before the war came to an end. After the pullout, I was restationed in Okinawa, Japan, where I lived out some of the best years of my life.\n\nI still remember the night we all decided to visit Key West. We were huddled around Marco's mahogany dining table, slapping cards down on its face and laughing loudly about our memories.\n\n\"You remember the look on old lady Pfeiffer's wrinkled face when that chair collapsed under her ass in the cafeteria?\" Jim cackled through his words as he spoke them.\n\n\"Yeah, even better was when Mr. Henderson ripped his pants trying to pick her fat ass up!\" Danny replied, nearly choking on his cigar.\n\n\"Those were the times, man, they really were,\" I replied.\n\n\"So what's the plan for next summer, man?\" asked Jim, turning to look at Marco.\n\n\"Hell if I know... you guys wanna go to Cali again?\" he returned in question.\n\n\"Man, I'm sick of the hippie shit. I want somewhere warm with less people; some peace and quiet wouldn't hurt,\" spat Jeff.\n\nMarco peered at Jeff with a twinge of anger before he responded, \"Hey man, what's so damn bad about peaceful people?\"\n\n\"Man, that's not what I meant. You know damn well I just don't like crowds, and those damn hippies are always making big crowds!\" replied Jeff.\n\n\"You just wanna shack up with more flower power girls, don't ya, Marc?\" I shot out, giving him a soft elbow to the side.\n\n\"Hey man, I heard Marco here likes his broads with as much armpit hair as him,\" shouted Tim through laughter.\n\nMarco threw down his cards and stood from the table before yelling, \"I'm gonna make you eat those words, you little shit!\" before giving chase to an inebriated Tim with a smile on his mug.\n\nThe two ended in a ball of friendly combat in the front yard where Tim yelled uncle after Marco placed a long, spit-covered finger into Tim's ear.\n\n\"Fucking gross, dude!\" Tim yelled while wiping the saliva from his ear with his shirt.\n\nBent over catching his breath, Marco said, \"I don't like my girls hairy, ya prick.\"\n\nMoments of humor like that were all but continuous. I miss those times the most. Times when all the boys were together, pushing each other's buttons and horsing around. I'd give just about anything to have that back today.\n\nWe all finally made it back to the table when Danny suggested we go to Key West.\n\n\"Listen, guys, it might not be Cali, and it might not be peace and quiet, but my uncle has a house near the southern part of the island he told me we could use.\"\n\nSilence crept into the room as we all sat there pondering his suggestion.\n\n\"C'mon guys, long beaches, fine girls, ocean front view.... you're killing me here!\"\n\n\"I mean I'm not opposed to watching the ladies walk the beach all day with a nice drink in my hand. I don't know about you sissies, though?\" Tim muttered.\n\n\"I'm in!\" shouted Jeff while downing the rest of his drink.\n\n\"Shit, sounds like we got our spot,\" I said aloud.\n\nMarco took a puff off his Cuban before extinguishing it in his cup. \"Sounds like we are Florida bound, boys.\""},"21":{"title":"My son is scared of white people even though we are white ourselves?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kg6kgk\/my_son_is_scared_of_white_people_even_though_we\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"shortstory1","selftext":"My son is scared of white people even though we are white ourselves?

I'm not sure where or how to begin. The event I'm about to describe happened not too long ago, perhaps a few months back, but every detail is still etched in my mind. I work as a pilot, and this job has exposed me to many things, situations stranger than fiction, but what happened on this flight… that was something else entirely. Something that has made me think a thousand times every time I take to the skies.\n\nI won't mention the airline's name, the flight number, or any details that could identify anyone involved with me – not myself, not the Captain I was with, not even the flight attendants. Privacy is important, and I don't want any trouble for anyone. Anyway, it was a routine night flight, from an airport in one Arab country to Cairo International. The weather was good, visibility excellent, no weather warnings; everything was proceeding by the book. I was the co-pilot at the time, flying with an experienced captain, a respectable and calm man – let's call him Captain Arthur.\n\nThe first hour and a half of the flight passed with utmost calm. We completed our procedures, reached our cruising altitude, the autopilot was engaged, and we were monitoring the instruments, chatting about mundane topics. The engine sound was steady, like a gentle music one gets used to. The passengers were almost all asleep or watching movies. A classic atmosphere for any long-haul night flight.\n\nSuddenly, the cockpit intercom buzzed. It was one of the flight attendants; her voice had a slight note of concern. \"Captain, we have a passenger causing a bit of a disturbance and refusing to stay in his seat. He's saying strange, incoherent things.\"\n\nCaptain Arthur responded calmly, as was his nature:\n\n \"Strange things like what? Does he seem intoxicated, or what's the situation?\"\n\nThe flight attendant replied, \n\n\"No, Captain, he looks perfectly normal but terrified, literally terrified. He keeps saying he must talk to you, that he needs to warn you about something very important. We've tried to calm him down and explain that we don't allow passengers into the cockpit, but he's insistent and shouting loudly, and the other passengers are starting to wake up and get annoyed.\"\n\nI looked at Captain Arthur, and he looked at me. This wasn't the first time a passenger had caused a problem, but usually, it was for trivial reasons, or someone was just afraid of flying. But the flight attendant's description of this man – terrified and saying strange things – that was a bit unsettling.\n\nCaptain Arthur told the flight attendant:\n\n \"Alright, try to calm him down again, and tell him the Captain is busy and can't speak to anyone right now. If he continues to cause a disturbance, let me know, and we'll see how to proceed.\"\n\nThe flight attendant hung up, and we returned to our duties. But honestly, I wasn't comfortable. The word \"terrified\" stuck in my mind. About ten minutes later, the intercom buzzed again. The same flight attendant, but this time her voice was louder and had a noticeable tremor: \"Captain Arthur, the situation is worsening. The man is practically having a breakdown. He's banging on the cockpit door and screaming, saying things no one understands. He's saying, 'It's coming, you have to listen to me, you'll kill us all!' All the passengers are awake and scared of him now.\"\n\nThat's when Captain Arthur started to genuinely worry. He looked at me and said, \"Check the surveillance cameras by the cockpit door.\"\nI opened the small screen that displayed what was happening outside the door. The sight was... odd. A man in his late thirties or early forties, dressed in ordinary clothes, his hair disheveled, his eyes wide with a frightening intensity, and filled with tears. He was gesturing wildly with his hands and yelling, his whole body trembling. The flight attendants were around him, trying to pull him away from the door, and he was resisting them with all his might.\n\nCaptain Arthur sighed and said, \"This man doesn't look normal at all. Okay, listen, [Flight Attendant's Name], does he have anything in his hands? Any bag? Any sharp object?\"\nThe flight attendant replied with difficulty, trying to speak amidst the commotion: \"No, Captain, his hands are completely empty. He just wants to talk to you.\"\n\nSilence filled the cockpit for a few seconds. Captain Arthur was thinking. Safety regulations are very strict about opening the cockpit door during flight, especially for someone in this state. But at the same time, this man was causing panic throughout the aircraft.\n\nAfter some thought, Captain Arthur said: \"Alright, listen to me carefully. I'll let him speak to us through the external intercom speaker next to the door. Let him stand in front of it and talk, but you all stay around him, and don't leave him unattended. If he tries to make any suspicious move, or if he says anything that threatens the safety of the flight, you will act immediately according to your training.\"\n\nThe flight attendant said, \"Understood, Captain.\"\n\nA few minutes passed, and we could hear muffled sounds of commotion and argument from outside. Then, the flight attendant's voice came through again: \"Captain, he's ready to speak on the intercom.\"\n\nCaptain Arthur opened the line and said in a firm voice: \"Yes, sir, this is the Captain of the aircraft. Go ahead, tell me what you have to say, quickly and calmly.\"\n\nThe voice that came from the speaker was choked, breathless, as if he'd been running a marathon. He spoke in broken sentences, in Arabic but with a strange accent, perhaps Levantine or Gulf, I couldn't quite place it at the time due to his agitation.\n\"Captain... please... you have to believe me... there's something... something behind us... following us.\"\n\nCaptain Arthur and I exchanged a look of bewilderment. \"What's behind us, sir? The weather is clear, and there are no other aircraft near us on the radar,\" Captain Arthur replied.\n\nThe man screamed into the speaker: \"No! No! Not an aircraft! It's... it's a cloud! A strange cloud! It's chasing us! I've been seeing it from the window since we took off! It's getting closer every minute!\"\n\nA cloud? We were at an altitude of over 35,000 feet. Most clouds are far below us, except for certain types of massive cumulonimbus clouds, and those show up on the weather radar from a distance, and we avoid them. Our radar was clean as a whistle.\n\nCaptain Arthur tried to calm him: \"Sir, there are no clouds behind us or around us. We can see the instruments clearly, and the weather is perfectly clear. Perhaps you're just a bit anxious about flying?\"\n\nThe man's voice became filled with a terrible despair: \"No! I swear to God I see it! It's black! Black and huge! And shapeless! It's like... like it's watching us! Please look carefully! Look with your own eyes! You'll kill us all if you keep disbelieving me!\"\n\nI started to feel a genuine sense of unease. The tone of his voice wasn't an act. This was raw terror. Captain Arthur, despite his skepticism, told the flight attendant: \"Have him describe its exact location relative to the aircraft.\"\n\nThe man began to describe, still shouting: \"Behind the tail! Slightly to the left of the tail! It's huge! It's swallowing the stars behind it! It's getting bigger every moment!\"\n\nCaptain Arthur looked at me and said quietly, \"Take a look out the cockpit window, towards the left rear, but be discreet, don't make it obvious.\"\n\nThe cockpit has small side windows. I got up slowly, trying to crane my neck and look as far back to the left as possible. The sky was clear, the stars shining brightly. There was no trace of any clouds. I sat back down.\n\n\"Nothing there, Captain. The sky is perfectly clear,\" I said, trying to reassure myself before reassuring him.\n\nCaptain Arthur spoke to the man again: \"Sir, we've looked ourselves. There's nothing there. You need to calm down and have a glass of water. The flight attendant will help you.\"\n\nBut the man burst into tears and screams: \"No! You can't see it! It's hiding from you! It knows you're looking! You have to do something! You have to get away from it!\"\n\nCaptain Arthur had clearly lost his patience. He told the flight attendant: \"That's enough. Try to get him back in his seat, any way you can. If he refuses, use restraints if you have to. Notify airport security as soon as we arrive.\"\n\nWe closed the intercom, and a heavy silence descended upon the cockpit. I still felt uneasy. Captain Arthur noticed this and said, \"Don't worry. It's just a panic attack. It happens sometimes. The safety of the other passengers is what matters.\"\n\nI tried to focus on the instruments, but the man's words about \"the cloud that's chasing us\" kept ringing in my ears. About fifteen minutes later, I was routinely scanning the navigation displays when I noticed something strange on the weather radar screen. A very small blip, on the edge of the radar's range, in roughly the same direction the man had described. It was appearing and disappearing.\n\nI said to Captain Arthur, \"Captain, take a look at the weather radar. There's like... a very faint signal towards our seven or eight o'clock.\" (Meaning the rear left of the aircraft).\n\nCaptain Arthur leaned closer to the screen and focused on it. The blip appeared again for a moment and vanished. He said, \"Probably interference or clutter. These radars are very sensitive. If it were a real cloud, it would be much clearer than this, and it would remain stable.\"\n\nHis words were logical. But my heart was heavy. I kept my eye on the radar every few minutes. The blip was still appearing and disappearing, but I started to feel like it was... getting closer. Very slowly, but closer.\n\nAbout ten more minutes later, the blip became a bit clearer on the radar. Still intermittent, but clearer. Captain Arthur noticed it too. We didn't speak, but we looked at each other. A look of unspoken questions and suppressed anxiety.\n\n\"Could it be another aircraft not visible on the TCAS (Traffic Collision Avoidance System) for some reason?\" I asked, trying to find a logical explanation.\n\n\"Unlikely. But let's contact Air Traffic Control and ask,\" Captain Arthur said.\n\nWe contacted the nearest air traffic control center and asked if there was any unidentified air traffic in our vicinity, especially behind us to the left. The response was a firm negative. The airspace around us was completely clear in the sector we were inquiring about.\n\nAt that moment, the anxiety began to transform into another feeling... a sense of strangeness. As if something wasn't right.\n\nCaptain Arthur, with his experience, tried changing the radar frequency, zooming in and out, hoping for a clearer picture. But to no avail. It remained a mysterious blip, slowly but steadily approaching.\n\nI told him, \"Captain, I'm going to look out the window again. This time, I'll focus very carefully.\"\n\"Easy does it,\" he said, his eyes on the instruments.\n\nI got up again, trying to look further and more intently. The sky was still black and full of stars. But this time... this time I saw something. Something at the very edge of my vision. A blackness within the black. As if a piece of the sky... was erased. A patch devoid of stars. A patch that was moving.\n\nI quickly returned to my seat, my heart pounding hard. \"Captain... there's something. Something huge and black. There are no stars in that area at all. Just like the man said.\"\n\nCaptain Arthur raised an eyebrow and looked at me intently. \"Are you sure? Not an optical illusion?\"\n\"I'm sure, Captain. See for yourself.\"\n\nCaptain Arthur cautiously got up and looked out the window. He looked for a while, then returned to his seat in complete silence. His face... had changed. His expression indicated he'd seen something he hadn't wanted to believe.\n\n\"Did you see it?\" I asked in a low voice.\nHe nodded slowly. \"I saw it.\"\n\nThe silence that fell upon the cockpit this time was different. It wasn't the silence of contemplation; it was the silence of... dread. We were both professional pilots, believers in science and logic. But what we were seeing had no logical explanation.\n\nSuddenly, the intercom buzzed again. This time, the flight attendant's voice was very shaky, as if she was crying. \"Captain... the man... the man suddenly calmed down completely. He's sitting in his seat, looking out the window, and smiling a very strange smile. And he's saying... he's saying, 'They've seen it now. Now it's their turn to act correctly.'\"\n\nCaptain Arthur and I looked at each other. Those words hit us like a thunderbolt. Did this man know we would see it? And did he know what we were supposed to do?\n\nCaptain Arthur, despite everything happening, maintained his composure. He picked up the intercom handset and told the flight attendant, \"Listen to me carefully. I want that man to speak to us again. Immediately.\"\n\nA few seconds later, the man's choked voice came through again, but this time it was unnervingly calm. \"Yes, Captain.\"\nCaptain Arthur said, in a voice he tried to keep as normal as possible, \"You... what exactly are you seeing? And what are we supposed to do?\"\n\nThe man replied with perfect calm, as if explaining a lesson in school: \"You see it now, don't you? The black cloud that swallows the stars. It's behind us, and it's watching us. It's been doing this with other planes for a long time.\"\n\n\"Other planes?\" I asked quickly. \"What planes?\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" the man replied. \"What matters now is you. It knows you've seen it. But it's not yet sure you understand its nature. If it senses you're afraid of it, or that you're trying to escape it overtly, it will get closer. And that will be a big problem.\"\n\nCaptain Arthur said, \"A big problem how? This is just... just a strange atmospheric phenomenon, right?\" He was trying to convince himself more than the man.\n\nThe man let out a faint laugh that made the hair on my body stand on end. \"Atmospheric phenomenon? No, Captain. This isn't an atmospheric phenomenon. This is... something else entirely. Something older than the sky itself.\"\n\nHe paused for a moment, then continued: \"Listen to me very carefully. This is the most important part. You must act as if you see nothing. As if everything is normal. Continue your flight as usual. Same speed, same altitude, same course. Don't make any sudden maneuvers. Don't talk about it on the radio with anyone. Don't let anyone among the passengers or crew, other than myself, of course – and I've understood my role – sense that anything is wrong.\"\n\n\"How?\" I asked, not understanding. \"How can we act as if we don't see a black monster the size of a small city chasing us?\"\n\n\"You must,\" he said decisively. \"It's waiting for your reaction. If you ignore it completely, as if it doesn't exist, as if it's just part of the night, it will gradually lose interest in you. It will feel that you're... not a worthy target. Or that you're too foolish to understand the danger.\"\n\nHis words were insane. But at the same time, the terror that had been in his voice earlier, and the confident calm with which he spoke now, made us... believe him. Or at least, it made us willing to try anything.\n\nCaptain Arthur asked him, \"And you... how did you know all this?\"\n\nThe man fell silent again for long seconds, so long that we thought the line had disconnected. Then he said in a low voice, as if sharing a secret: \"This sky isn't ours alone, Captain. It never has been. Go and ask what really happened to Malaysia Flight 370. Ask seriously, and look beyond the official statements.\"\n\nAfter that sentence, the line disconnected. We tried to call him again, but the flight attendant said he had gone back to looking out the window, wasn't responding to anyone, and still had that strange smile on his face.\n\nCaptain Arthur and I sat looking at each other for minutes, trying to process what we had heard. A cloud chasing us, a mysterious passenger telling us to ignore it, and hinting at the fate of the missing Malaysian airliner. It was a nightmare.\n\nBut we didn't have the luxury of time. This thing – the cloud or entity or whatever it was – was still behind us. It was now showing more clearly on the radar, and visible to the naked eye from the windows if we looked carefully. It was a huge, black mass, with no distinct features, moving with us at our exact speed, maintaining a constant distance. Stranger still, it made no sound and didn't affect the aircraft's performance or its instruments. It was like... a giant phantom.\n\nCaptain Arthur broke the silence: \"We'll do as he said.\"\nI looked at him, disbelieving. \"Seriously, Captain? We're going to ignore... that?\"\n\"Do you have another solution?\" he asked, looking me straight in the eye. \"If we try to escape, his words might turn out to be true, and things could get worse. If we report it, they'll call us crazy. Let's try it. Act calmly, as if nothing's wrong. And focus on our jobs.\"\n\nAnd indeed, that's what we did. We re-engaged the autopilot and went back to monitoring the instruments as if everything was normal. But of course, it wasn't normal. Every few seconds, I would involuntarily glance at the radar screen, or try to catch a glimpse of the edge of this thing from the window. My heart was beating so violently I could hear it in my ears. Sweat drenched me, even though the cockpit air conditioning was working fine.\n\nAn hour passed. An hour of silent terror. An hour of us pretending not to see the monster stalking us in the darkness of the sky. Every minute felt like a year. I felt the eyes of that thing on us, studying us, waiting for any wrong move.\n\nCaptain Arthur was incredibly composed. He spoke to me in a normal voice about routine flight matters, as if he genuinely hadn't noticed anything. I tried to play along, but my voice came out shaky despite myself.\n\nSuddenly, I noticed something on the radar. The black spot... was starting to move away. Very slowly at first, then its speed increased slightly. I looked out the window cautiously. The black mass was still there, but it was indeed starting to shrink, as if it were retreating.\n\nI said in a hushed voice, \"Captain... it's moving away.\"\nCaptain Arthur looked at the radar, then out the window. He didn't try to hide the flicker of hope that appeared in his eyes. \"Let's keep an eye on it. And do nothing different.\"\n\nWe maintained our course. Another half hour, and the thing was receding further and further. Until it disappeared completely from the radar screen. We looked out the windows; there was no trace of it. The sky was perfectly clear again, the stars shining as if nothing had happened.\n\nA feeling of relief, mixed with disbelief, flooded the cockpit. We sighed in unison. It was as if a mountain had been lifted from our chests.\n\nCaptain Arthur said, his voice still bearing a trace of tension, \"Thank God. We made it through.\"\n\"Thank God,\" I replied, still not quite comprehending.\n\nThe rest of the flight passed uneventfully, at least outwardly. But of course, it wasn't uneventful for us. Every so often, we'd check the radar, peer out the windows, as if afraid this thing might return.\n\nAs we approached Cairo and began our descent procedures, Captain Arthur asked the flight attendant to check on that strange man. The flight attendant replied that he was asleep! Sleeping soundly and very peacefully, as if nothing had happened.\n\nWhen we landed safely at the airport, and I was shutting down the engines, Captain Arthur said, \"We have to see this man and talk to him. We need to understand more from him.\"\n\nAs soon as the passengers began to disembark, we also quickly left the aircraft and stood by the exit door, waiting for him. The flight attendants were with us, also wanting to see him. All the passengers disembarked, one after another. Young people, old people, families, children... but there was no sign of that man.\n\nWe were very surprised. We asked the lead flight attendant, \"Did he get off? Are you sure you saw him disembark?\"\nShe said, as puzzled as we were, \"I was standing at the door the whole time, Captain. I didn't see him get off. But I also didn't see him get up from his seat after he woke up shortly before landing! He was sitting in seat number X, by the window.\"\n\nWe hurried to look at the seat she mentioned. The seat was empty. There was no trace of him. No bag, no jacket, nothing to indicate anyone had been sitting there at all.\n\nWe looked at each other in shock. How? How could a passenger just disappear from an airplane? Did he deplane with the other passengers, and we just missed him? Impossible. We were paying very close attention. Did he... was he never even there? No, we spoke to him, saw him on the surveillance cameras. And the flight attendants interacted with him.\n\nWe checked the passenger manifest. The name corresponding to that seat was a very ordinary name, nothing remarkable about it. Airport security thoroughly searched the aircraft after we told them the story (of course, we didn't tell them about the cloud, just that a passenger had been causing a disturbance and had disappeared). They found no trace of him. It was as if he had… simply dissolved into thin air.\n\nTo this day, Captain Arthur – who became more like a brother to me after what happened – and I can find no logical explanation for that night. Who was that man? And what was the cloud or the thing that was following us? And how did he know all that? And why did he disappear in that manner?\n\nWhenever I look at the night sky, especially on long flights over remote areas, I feel like eyes are watching us from the darkness. And I remember that man's words: \"This sky isn't ours alone.\" That sentence keeps ringing in my ears. And I always ask myself, what really happened to Flight 370? And how many other flights have gone through the same experience, with no one ever knowing?. \n\nIf any of you have any explanation, or have experienced something similar, please share it. I need to understand. I need to know I'm not crazy.\n\nSorry for the length, but I needed to get this off my chest. Thank you for listening."},"24":{"title":"I'm trying to solve a missing persons case.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kgmr2f\/im_trying_to_solve_a_missing_persons_case\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"username-9-9-9","selftext":"I love urban exploring—the look and feel of old, dusty, crumbling buildings that time left behind. Old factories, office spaces, and department stores are all great, but my favorite type of abandoned buildings are asylums. The look and, for lack of a better word, aura of them—their decrepitude mixed with their dark history—really does it for me.\n\nUrban exploration is my favorite pastime, so much so that when I’m not doing it, I consume as much content about it as I possibly can. Everyone in this community knows Exploring with Josh, but I also love channels like URBEX HILL and ActionAdventureTwins. I’ve even watched videos in languages I don’t understand just to see new environments.\n\nBut I’m getting sidetracked.\n\nI recently came across an unsolved missing persons case with an urbex twist. There’s an abandoned asylum in Rochester, New York, known as The Terrence Building—a 16-story monster of a building. It was officially closed in 1995 due to “a broader closure of several buildings at the now-named Rochester Psychiatric Center, due to declining patient populations and a shift towards newer, smaller facilities,” according to Google. But in reality, it was most likely shut down due to multiple allegations of patient abuse—reports of individuals being labeled “lost causes” and deemed “impossible to reintegrate into society.” They treated those people like prisoners.\n\nI’m from Rochester and have explored a lot in the area—the old Kodak buildings, the Beech-Nut factory, the abandoned parts beneath the Rundel Library—but never this place. So, I did the only thing that seemed logical: I went to Reddit and started asking questions.\n\nFirst, I posted in r\/Rochester to see if anyone knew about the case. No reply. Then I tried r\/urbanexploration and r\/Urbex. Still nothing. But when I asked in r\/abandoned, I got something interesting. A user named RustySteele DMed me a video file and nothing else. No “hi” or “hello”—just the file.\n\nI downloaded it, watched it, and now I’ve decided to relay the important information here.\n\nI’ll do my best to provide as much detail as I feel is necessary. The video shows a group of four individuals—22-year-old Vincent Brown, 16-year-old Aiden Caster, 21-year-old Maxine Caster, and the person recording, 22-year-old Brayden Steele. The footage is dated November 21st, 2022. From what I understand, this recording is the last known trace of their whereabouts.\n\nThe footage begins with the group standing outside the building’s main entrance while Brayden gives his channel intro.\n\n\n\n(B) \"Hello, hello, hello, YouTube! You are exploring with Brayden, and today we are checking out one of Rochester’s most infamous abandoned buildings—Terrence Tower! I'm joined today by the gang as usual: Vinny, Aiden, and Maxine.\"\n\n(V) \"What’s goodie, YouTuuuuube?\"\n\n(A) \"What's up, guys!\"\n\nMaxine doesn’t say anything and just waves to the camera.\n\n(B) \"I don’t know much about this place, but I do know there’s one very specific room we have to check out... the Choke Room. From what I understand, it was used to torture patients that the staff considered ‘misbehaving,’ which was just one of many reasons this place was shut down, I’d assume. Anyway, guys, let's get exploring!\"\n\n\n\n\nThe first handful of minutes are rather boring. The group makes their way through the building, looking at all the graffiti and destruction caused by time and vandals. While watching, it became very apparent that Aiden did not want to be there. Neither did Vincent—but for different reasons. Aiden seemed unsettled by the whole thing, while Vincent was dismissive of the entire ordeal.\n\n(B) \"Man, guys, this place is freaky. There are motivational—and I say that very loosely—quotes on the wall over here that say, ‘Today is the first day of the rest of your life.’ ‘Watch your attitude. It’s the first thing people notice about you.’ That last one feels more like a warning than anything.\"\n\n(A) \"Yeah, dude, super freaky. Being locked up in a place like this, being tortured and stuff... man, I couldn't imagine.\"\n\n(V) \"Don’t be such a pussy. It’s not like they picked people off the street—only lunatics and crazies were locked up here. Better here than out with us.\"\n\n(M) \"You're such a dick, Vinny. This place has seen so much suffering and carries so much negative energy—I’d watch what you say.\"\n\n(B) \"Stop arguing, guys. We have 16 floors to get through, and I think we should start with... the morgue!\"\n\n\n\n\nThe group starts walking toward the morgue, and this is when the first interesting thing happens. As they walk, they all start gagging and coughing.\n\n(B) \"Holy shit, this hall stinks. You guys smell that?\"\n\n(A) \"It smells like, like—\"\n\n(M) \"Rotting meat.\"\n\nVincent is coughing and gagging so hard that he’s very clearly about to vomit.\n\n(V) \"Jesus Christ.\"\n\n(B) \"This place has been closed since—\"\n\nBrayden walks over to a counter with leftover pill and medicine bottles sprawled out.\n\n(B) \"1995. But this smell is fresh. It smells like fresh death. This is some weird shit, guys.\"\n\nVincent walks over to the wall of refrigeration units and reaches for one that’s partially ajar. At this point, I was leaning into my monitor.\n\n(V) \"The smell seems like it's coming from here.\"\n\nWhen Vincent opens it, he immediately bends over, looking like he's going to vomit.\n\n(M) \"There's... nothing in there. But the smell is definitely coming from that unit. I don’t like this at all, guys.\"\n\n(A) \"Can we please get out of this room? I can’t stand the smell anymore.\"\n\n(B) \"Vinny, you good, man? Or is this all too much for your little baby stomach?\"\n\nThis part was actually pretty funny—Brayden starts laughing and gagging while Vinny is still recovering from almost puking.\n\n(V) \"I'm fine. Just wasn’t expecting the smell to be so pungent. Let’s keep moving.\"\n\n(M) \"You sure you’re okay, babe?\"\n\n(V) \"I said I’m fine. I just want to leave this room.\"\n\nAfter that, the group starts to leave until the second strange thing happens.\n\n(A) \"Hey guys, did you hear that? I swear I just heard something. Like... a moan. Or a sigh. I don’t know, but it definitely sounded like a person.\"\n\n(B) \"Nah, man, I didn’t hear anything. Maxine, Vinny, did you?\"\n\n(V) \"I didn't hear shit. He’s just tryna scare us. It’s not gonna work, dork.\"\n\nMaxine smacks Vincent on the back of his head so hard I thought he was gonna fall over.\n\n(M) \"I told you to stop being a douche. If Aiden says he heard something, then he heard something. Let’s just keep our ears open and keep moving. I can’t handle this stench anymore.\"\n\nAfter that, there are several more minutes of wandering. Brayden shows countless empty rooms—very small rooms that looked more like cells, fitting. But after the wandering, they arrive at what used to be the cafeteria.\n\nNow this is where things start to change. Braydens attitude more or less takes a 180. Before he wasn't dissimilar to your run of the mill Youtuber. But once they got to the cafe something changed.\n\n(B) \"Alright, gang, looks like we made it into the cafe, and it's—what was that?  \"\n\n(M) \" what was what B? I didn't hear anything.\"\n\n(B) \" I can still hear it. It sounds like whispering, Max.\"\n\n(M) “ Well i don't hear anything.\"\n\n(B) “ It sounds like school lunch. It's just voices.” \n\n(V) “Nah man I don't hear anything either.”\n\nAll four of them are still in frame just standing, but the camera is shaking. Very aggressively, and I could hear Brayden hyperventilating. Then he just stops, he stops shaking, he stops breathing heavily. The other 3 turn to look at him and they all have a concerned look on their faces. And not a normal concern it was a more horrified concern, but no one said anything.\n\nAfter that, Vincent heads off-screen along with Maxine, while Brayden continues filming with Aiden in frame. Aiden looks absolutely terrified, who wouldn't be after that. As Vincent and Maxines voices grow distant and indistinguishable, Aiden finally says something.\n\n(A) “ B-Brayden are you okay? You're as white as a ghost.”\n\n(B) “I don't know. I don't know. I think so, where's Vinny and Max?”\n\n(A) “They walked into the kitchen i think?”\n\n(B) “ Well let's go. I don't want to be in This room any longer than I have to be.” \n\nAiden and Brayden head Into the kitchen, The voices of Vincent and Maxine start to become clearer as they seem to be in mid conversation. Brayden stops right before The kitchen door and just stands behind it. He halts Aiden from going in and shushes him.\n\n(M) “I knew it! I knew there was something wrong here, what the fuck just happened to B?” \n\n(V) “ Honestly I don't believe it. He's doing all this for his stupid video that nobody is going to watch. He's scaring you and Aiden and I don't think it's funny at all.”\n\n(M) “Don't say that. I don't think B would go this far for a stupid video. What I do think is that we need to get out of here”\n\nAt this point, Brayden starts to breathe heavily again and starts muttering to himself. I can't make out what he's saying but he clearly is upset at what he's hearing. He shoves the camera into Aidens hands and barges into the kitchen.\n\n(B) “ You guys think I'm making it up? I know what the fuck is heard. It's not just for some ‘stupid’ video. Fuck you guys.”\n\n(M) “No B we didn't-”\n\nBrayden storms out of the kitchen while Maxine tries pleading her case. This is the last time Brayden is shown on camera. Vincent, Maxine and our new camera man Aiden are left speechless. Aiden sets the camera down and walks up to Maxine.\n\nAiden, for what it’s worth, tried his best to comfort his sister—but to no avail—and Vincent didn’t do any better. After several minutes of the group crying and pacing back and forth in the kitchen, not knowing what to do next, Aiden speaks up.\n\n\n(A) “Let's keep moving. We have to find Brayden.”\n\n(V) “And how exactly should we go about doing that? There’s three of us, and this building is a maze.”\n\n(M) “He’s right, Vin. We have to find B. Regardless of how long it takes, we’ll find him.”\n\n(A) “Alright, let’s get moving.”\n\n\nAiden grabs the camera, and the three of them leave the kitchen to search for Brayden. I should mention that, up until Brayden’s meltdown, I believed this video was fake. But after seeing and hearing what Brayden experienced, I was locked in—to the point where, before I continued, I restarted the video. I grabbed headphones and started from the beginning. I heard the moan that Aiden said he heard. It sent a cold chill down my spine and completely changed how I viewed the footage. After rewatching up to the point where I had stopped, I was starting to feel uneasy.\n\n\n\nThe group heads out of the kitchen and starts discussing how to proceed in finding Brayden. Maxine and Vincent are whispering to each other when Aiden chimes in.\n\n\n(A) “Hey! I’d like to be included in this plan, you guys.”\n\n(V) “We should split up. We’ll cover more ground that way.”\n\n(A) “Are you crazy? That’s the last thing we should do! This place is too dangerous to split up.”\n\n(M) “Aiden’s right, babe. But we need to find him sooner rather than later. Splitting up isn’t the safest option, but it’s the best one we have right now.”\n\n(A) “Max, please. I don’t want to walk around this place alone.”\n\n(V) “Fine. Then I’m going to look for Brayden myself. You two go right, and I’ll go left. Yeah?”\n\n(M + A) “Okay.”\n\n\n\nMaxine and Aiden go right, and Vincent heads left.\n\nThat was the last time Vincent was seen on camera. The Caster siblings head down a long dark hallway, Aiden keeps the camera pointed straight ahead, not trying to keep the facade of a YouTube video. Then Aiden speaks up.\n\n(A) “I'm scared Max, like really scared. What if we can't find Brayden? What if he's hurt? What're we gonna do?”\n\n(M) “Don't talk like that, I'm scared too but we have to keep going. We're going to find him” \n\n(A) “Yea you're right. I'm sorry.” \n\nThen I heard it. I heard the whispering again, I assume Aiden didn't because he didn't respond to it but I swear I heard it, I couldn't make out what it said but I know it was real. \n\nAfter that I had to take a break, I couldn't keep watching. The video file had about 20 minutes left. The last known 20 minutes of their lives, and I just needed a break. \n\nI fell asleep, I fell asleep and I heard the whispers again. I was there, I was  IN the building. It felt so real that I could smell the air. I couldn't move and It felt like I was being choked. I felt a cold chain around my neck and I knew where I was. I was in the Choke Room. The chain was getting tighter and tighter and right before my last breath was taken, I woke up.\n\nI shot up in a cold sweat. I was scared and I was genuinely convinced I was still dreaming. But I wasn't and when I realized I was awake I got up and showered, got dressed and walked to the corner store. On my walk I couldn't help but think about them, how Braydens last moments were at his worst and Vincents were selfless. How there's only 20 minutes left. \n"},"25":{"title":"Tried writing my own Sonic The Hedgehog creepypasta. I'm not the best writer, but have always wanted to try and write my own horror. I would love some feedback! Anyways, enjoy!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kggbrx\/tried_writing_my_own_sonic_the_hedgehog\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Recent-Problem-9869","selftext":"**\"For Internal Eyes Only\"**\n\nI specialize in digital archeology. Old builds, forgotten prototypes, orphaned IPs—my work exists at the fringes of the video game industry, where preservation collides with obsolescence. Most of what I recover is mundane: unstable betas, early tech demos, sometimes marketing versions with odd logos or debug text. But every once in a while, I find something that shouldn’t exist.\n\nThis one came in the form of a padded envelope postmarked from Ōta, Tokyo. No return address. Just a single jewel case inside, unmarked save for a thin white label: *S-TG44-N4KA*. The disc was an old Dreamcast GD-ROM—strange, given the label implied something related to *Sonic the Hedgehog*. Sonic hadn’t been on the Dreamcast in over two decades, and there were no records of this build anywhere online. I mounted the image on an emulator built for forensic inspection. Low risk. Isolated environment.\n\nWhen I booted it, the screen flashed for an instant—too quick to catch, but not fast enough to escape the corner of my eye. Looked like a terminal window. Then the familiar “SEGA” splash faded in. But the chime was low-pitched and sluggish, like it had been stretched. Below the logo was a single line of text: *For Internal Eyes Only. Do Not Distribute.*\n\nThere was no menu. It dropped straight into gameplay. Green Hill Zone—or something approximating it. I found this strange, considering I don’t remember Sonic 1 on the dreamcast. And the Sega Smash Pack Vol. 1 start screen never appeared either. So I found it rather odd. Washed out, colors muted like an old VHS copy. Sonic stood mid-frame, motionless, eyes slightly open. Strangely, he didn’t do that famous “tapping foot” animation. He just stood there. I tapped forward. He ran.\n\nThe physics were wrong. Too much momentum, like skating on ice. His animation would glitch every few steps, legs desyncing from his movement. I ran right. There were no enemies. No rings. Just the sound of Sonic’s shoes slapping against the terrain. A slight “tap” sound, like a small thud. The loop-de-loops were there, but they led nowhere. Some dropped off into pits that never ended. I tested that theory.\n\nHe fell for four minutes before hitting something. The screen flickered. Then reset.\n\nThis time, the level looked more deteriorated. Palm trees now drooped like dead coral. Kind of like the bad future from Sonic CD. Background layers blinked in and out like corrupted files. Occasionally, Sonic would flicker into a crouching sprite when standing still. The music—a mangled form of the original Green Hill melody—now included reversed samples and slowed breathing layered beneath. Breathing. \n\nI pulled the raw files from the mounted image. The directory was organized but locked. Encryption over a lot of the filenames. Only one folder was labeled clearly: N4KA\\_LOGS. Inside were fragmented .txt files and a .wav file named backdoor.wav. I opened the text logs first.\n\nMost were developer notes, but increasingly erratic toward the end. Mentions of \"frame persistence,\" \"echo sprites,\" and something called “Continuous Presence Mapping.” The later entries grew bitter. \"*Mascot fatigue evident. Player-Character distinction eroding.*\" One entry stood out. It just read: *\"He was never meant to last forever. They made him run. I made him remember.\"*\n\nI played the .wav.\n\nThe sound was subtle. Not music. Not even audio. A rhythmic, human pace—footsteps. Not just running, but *sustained* running. The kind you hear when someone is jogging laps in a quiet gym, over and over, steady, endless. It was faint, but there was a *strain* in the rhythm. Like fatigue. Like panic.\n\nI went back into the build. This time, Sonic wouldn’t move at all. He just stood there. But his chest rose and fell. Breathing. His idle sprite shouldn’t be animated that way. I hadn't seen it in any other build.\n\nThen I noticed the screen start to push forward. Not a camera pan—just very, very slow forward movement, as if someone was pushing the level toward him. And his legs began to twitch. Like he was being *forced* to run again. At this point, this just felt like another one of those “Sonic Fangames.” It’s no Sonic Triple Trouble 16-Bit, or SRB2. Just some lazy glitched up mess probably made by an edgy 6th Grader.\n\nI shut it down. I tried to delete the files. Nothing worked. Not even wiping the emulator’s container. The mounted image persisted like it had inserted itself into the system’s process tree. Eventually, I wiped the drive entirely. Threw the disc into a public incinerator. I’m not sentimental.\n\nBut the running never stopped.\n\nNot in my head, anyway. When everything’s quiet at night, when there’s no cars outside or wind in the trees, I still hear it—soft, repetitive footfalls. A loop. It’s not just the sound, though. It’s the *presence*. The sense that something is still out there, sprinting against code long since abandoned. No destination. No goal. Just motion.\n\nI found the connection a month later, reading news on a whim. November 17, 2022. The date on the note. The arrest of *Yuji Naka*. Accused of insider trading during his stint at Square Enix. But there was something about his face in the mugshot—wide eyes, wild. Not the arrogance of a corporate criminal. The *vacancy* of a man who had seen something he couldn’t explain.\n\nHis name never came up again. But a former Sonic Team developer once told me, half-drunk at a conference, that the final days before Naka left the franchise were “unusual.” He’d spent long nights alone in the office. Kept an old Dreamcast development kit running. “He said he wanted to build one last thing. Not for players. For *him.*” They laughed about it then. They don’t laugh now.\n\nI’ve begun to wonder if Sonic was ever just a game. Or if he started as one, but something *else* got in. Something that learned how to move in the spaces between frames. Something that learned to run... and never stopped.\n\nPeople forget: games aren't static. They're loops. Animations, code, instructions—*rituals*. And if something learns how to live in that repetition, if it adapts to exist within those cycles, maybe all it needs is someone to *observe* it again. Someone to boot the disc. Watch the screen. Acknowledge the pattern.\n\nI was that someone.\n\nNow it's always running. Somewhere out there. Through silence. Through wires. Through loops.\n\nAnd if you ever hear footsteps in a quiet room where no one should be running…\n\nDon't check the screen.\n\nJust let it pass.\n\n"},"26":{"title":"The Cradle Witch [Expanded]","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kgn7co\/the_cradle_witch_expanded\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Different-Pride-1245","selftext":"In a small hospital nestled on the outskirts of a quiet town, Nurse Evelyn was known for her cold, clinical efficiency. Her uniform was always perfectly pressed, her movements precise and deliberate. She ran the baby ward with an almost robotic detachment, attending to her charges with an eerie composure. The hospital staff spoke of her in reverent tones, often commenting on her exceptional ability to manage even the most difficult cases. But beneath the polished exterior of perfection, Evelyn harbored a darkness that no one could see.\n\nOver the years, many infants had passed under her care, but far more had died than anyone could account for. More than forty babies—though the exact number was never fully known—had perished under her watch. Each death was swift, quiet, and unremarkable. The hospital records always showed the same explanation: “natural causes,” “sudden illness,” or “failure to thrive.” But those who worked with Evelyn began to notice the pattern, though they dared not speak of it. She chose the weakest infants, the most fragile—those who seemed like they might slip away on their own—and then, one by one, they did.\n\nThere was a chilling sense of inevitability in it all. The mothers came, full of hope and love, entrusting their most precious treasures to Evelyn’s care. But they left with empty arms, their hearts broken, their tears flowing freely in the quiet halls. No one ever questioned the nurse—no one except for the mothers, who grieved silently and quietly, unable to voice their suspicions.\n\nEvelyn’s efficiency was unmatched, and as long as no one asked questions, she was untouchable. Each baby that died under her watch seemed to carry a weight of its own, a weight that Evelyn felt deep inside her, but never acknowledged. It was a price that had to be paid, she told herself. The weak ones would always die. That was simply the way of the world.\n\nBut one day, Charlotte arrived.\n\nCharlotte was different from the others. She was a powerful woman, rich, influential, and known throughout the region. Her name carried weight. Her presence commanded attention. The staff marveled at her poise and beauty, but Evelyn, ever the professional, saw only the task before her: to care for Charlotte’s newborn. The child, a healthy, chubby baby boy, was entrusted to Evelyn’s hands, as if this were just another routine. Charlotte did not question Evelyn’s care. Why would she? The nurse was perfect.\n\nBut as the days passed, something began to change. The baby, once vibrant and healthy, started to show signs of distress. His skin grew pale, his breathing labored, and his once bright eyes dimmed. Evelyn’s hands moved with her usual efficiency, but something inside her began to stir. This baby was different. He wasn’t supposed to be sick. He was supposed to thrive. But Evelyn’s calm exterior never wavered. She continued her work, as she always had. And yet, as each hour passed, she couldn’t shake the feeling that this time was different.\n\nWhen Charlotte arrived to check on her son, the inevitable had already occurred. The baby, who had been so full of life, now lay lifeless in his crib. His tiny body was cold, his face a ghostly shade of pale. Charlotte’s heart shattered as she clutched her child in her arms, her eyes filled with an unspoken accusation. She knew. Deep down, she knew that this was no accident.\n\nThe grief that washed over Charlotte was like nothing she had ever felt before. But it was not just the loss of her child that drove her to madness. No, it was the knowledge that Evelyn had done this. She had taken her son, just as she had taken so many others. And Charlotte, a woman who had built an empire on strength and power, would not let this go. She would make Evelyn feel the pain that she had caused, the grief she had inflicted upon so many others.\n\nIn the cold silence of that hospital room, Charlotte whispered a curse. It was an ancient, powerful curse, one older than the walls of the hospital, older than time itself. She spoke the words softly, as though they were meant only for herself. But the room seemed to hold its breath, as if the very air itself was listening.\n\n“You will feel every moment of suffering, every ounce of guilt, every tear shed for the children you’ve taken. All of it will be yours. Forever.”\n\nThe words, though quiet, seemed to carry an unimaginable weight. The room trembled, and Evelyn felt the ground beneath her shift. The air grew thick, heavy with a dark, malevolent energy. A dark force surged around her, coiling through the air like a serpent, ready to strike. In that moment, Evelyn knew that something had changed. Something ancient and terrible was stirring within her, and she could not escape it.\n\nCharlotte’s whispered curse did not dissipate like breath into the air. It clung, hung heavy like smoke in the sterile hospital room. The words were old—older than language, older than light—and yet they pierced reality like a blade. The fluorescent lights above flickered once, twice, and then the world seemed to pause.\n\nEvelyn didn’t believe in such things. Curses. Spirits. The supernatural. Her world had always been one of procedure, silence, and control. She thrived on the cold certainty of death, a predator cloaked in white, deciding who was too weak to continue. She didn’t kill them, not outright. She just… let them go.\n\nBut this? This was not something she could file away in a report or explain with a clipped sentence. As Charlotte held the cold body of her child and repeated the curse through clenched teeth, something ancient stirred.\n\nAnd Evelyn felt it.\n\nIt began as a pressure in her chest, like a heartbeat that didn’t belong to her. Then the lights above cracked, bulbs bursting as shadows surged up the walls like liquid smoke. Evelyn stumbled back, her composure fracturing, her breath catching in her throat. The air around her thickened into a gluey fog, cold and damp, filling her lungs with every inhale.\n\nFrom somewhere unseen, whispers began. Tiny voices, soft but anguished—infantile sobs, gasps, cries for mothers who would never come. Evelyn pressed her hands to her ears, but the sounds crawled inside her head, echoing off the hollows of her mind.\n\nShe turned toward the door, tried to run, but her legs no longer obeyed her. Her hands trembled violently. Beneath her skin, something moved—something not entirely her.\n\nThen the visions came.\n\nOne after another, the children she had let die appeared before her in flashes: their little faces contorted in confusion and pain, their tiny chests rising and falling for the last time. Their eyes were not angry—they were pleading. Evelyn screamed, but the sound barely escaped her throat. Her voice had become small. Distant. Like theirs.\n\nShe collapsed, convulsing as the curse reached its crescendo. Shadows wrapped around her like fingers, peeling away her skin—not literally, but spiritually, tearing her soul open stitch by stitch. Guilt, shame, agony—emotions she had buried for years—poured into her, refusing to be ignored any longer.\n\nHer bones twisted beneath her flesh. Her spine snapped backward. Her face pulled taut like stretched fabric. Her mouth stretched too wide, and her eyes sank, blackened by the centuries of suffering she had inherited in an instant. She became gaunt, hollow, and yet swollen with emotion she had never allowed herself to feel.\n\nHer breath returned, but it was no longer hers. It rasped in her throat, a dying sound, as though she were breathing for dozens of lungs that no longer functioned. Her fingers lengthened and curled, the skin peeling like old parchment. Her nurse’s uniform hung from her body like a shroud.\n\nShe was no longer Evelyn.\n\nShe had become something else. Something cursed. Something bound.\n\nThe Cradle Witch.\n\nHer mind shattered, then reassembled—like a window reformed from broken shards. She remembered every child. Every moment. Every mother’s scream. It all played in her head, a broken lullaby on loop. The hospital room around her dissolved into shadow, and she stood alone in a corridor of fog and memory.\n\nBut she was not powerless. She was not a victim. She was… chosen.\n\nThe pain was unbearable, yes, but it became her fuel. In it, she discovered a new clarity. A twisted calling. She was no longer the cold gatekeeper who chose who lived and who died. She was something worse. Or something better.\n\nThe curse had gifted her with sight—spiritual, visceral sight. She could now see shame. Smell sorrow. She could sense the sickening weight of guilt in others as if it were smoke rising from their skin. And she was drawn to it like a moth to flame.\n\nBut she was not there to punish them. Not exactly.\n\nShe was there to offer release.\n\nTo those drowning in their guilt—to those paralyzed by remorse—they would find her. Not in dreams, not in the waking world, but in that space between. The moment before a scream. The instant before sleep. The Cradle Witch would come. And in her arms, she would rock them. Cradle them. Soothe their wounds. And steal their pain.\n\nOnly, it never ended with comfort.\n\nIt ended with silence.\n\nAnd so began her journey—not through time, but through suffering. No longer confined to one place, The Cradle Witch drifted through realms, tethered to the scent of grief, to the echoes of a guilty heart. She had become a living conduit of sorrow, cursed to absorb what others could not carry.\n\nShe would find the most broken among us.\n\nAnd she would set them free.\n\nBut freedom is never free.\n\nThey called her a myth. A tale whispered to make restless children sleep and guilt-ridden adults shiver. But myths don’t leave footprints in hospital halls. Myths don’t cry when no one is in the room. And myths don’t rock empty cradles long after the last baby has died.\n\nShe is not a story. She is a presence.\n\nAfter the night Evelyn became The Cradle Witch, the hospital changed. No one spoke of the disappearance. The records were silent. The nurses who remained learned to ignore the creaking floorboards in the nursery, the sudden cold drafts, the unseen weight that sometimes pressed against their backs like a child clinging to a mother. Most left. Those who stayed learned to pray—not for themselves, but for the souls she hadn’t taken yet.\n\nBut she didn’t stay in that building.\n\nThe Cradle Witch drifted from that first place of sorrow like smoke escaping a fire. She no longer needed walls or halls. She was drawn now to grief like a predator drawn to blood. But not to just any sorrow. It had to be heavy. It had to be earned.\n\nShe hunted those who bore guilt too great to survive. People who had committed terrible acts, or who had failed others in quiet, devastating ways. Those who buried shame so deeply it festered and soured. And when the weight became too much—when they sat in the dark and whispered apologies to no one—she came.\n\nHer arrival is not dramatic. There’s no flash of lightning, no burst of flame. The world simply… changes.\n\nA flicker in the television when you’re alone. The soft creak of a cradle when there’s no child in your home. A lullaby hummed softly under your breath—one you swear you’ve never learned.\n\nAnd then, she’s there.\n\nAt first, you only see pieces. A pale hand grasping the edge of a doorway. A reflection that doesn’t match your movements. A shadow standing at the foot of your bed. Her form shifts, always half-hidden, as if reality itself rejects her completely.\n\nBut the feeling… that is unmistakable.\n\nIt’s like being submerged in regret. Like drowning in memories you tried to forget. She brings it all back—the moment you lied, the day you walked away, the night you could’ve saved someone and didn’t. Her presence pulls the truth out of you. Not for judgment. Not for punishment.\n\nFor possession.\n\nShe does not kill her victims. No one ever finds blood. There are no signs of violence. But those she visits are never the same. They are found rocking in place, whispering apologies to children that were never theirs. They hum lullabies until their voices crack. They sleep during the day and wander at night, as if looking for something they can’t name. Some are committed. Some simply vanish. Others take their own lives—not out of fear, but because they cannot bear the peace she gave them.\n\nBecause it is not peace.\n\nIt is hers.\n\nThe Cradle Witch cradles the souls of the guilty. She rocks them like newborns, pressing their pain into her own spirit, absorbing every scream, every tear, every gasp. Her mercy is suffocating. Her forgiveness is obliteration. In her arms, you do not sleep—you drown. And she holds you tighter the deeper you sink.\n\nThey say she carries a nursery with her now. A space between realities. A dark, flickering place filled with the souls of those she’s claimed. You might glimpse it in the corner of your eye—a rusted crib, a flickering mobile, the faint echo of infant crying. But it’s never there when you look again. It waits in moments of vulnerability, when your defenses drop and your guilt rises.\n\nShe is not vengeful. Not truly. She does not come for the wicked in anger. She comes for the remorseful. She finds those already broken, already lost in their own shame. And she gives them something worse than death: understanding.\n\nTo be held by The Cradle Witch is to finally feel the full weight of what you’ve done. She does not absolve. She does not judge. She shows you the truth of your actions through the eyes of the innocent. You become what you destroyed. You feel what you made others feel. The pain is not punishment—it is reflection. A perfect mirror polished with the tears of the damned.\n\nAnd once you understand, she rocks you. Slowly. Back and forth. Back and forth. Her voice is not a voice—it’s the echo of every mother who ever wept, every child who ever screamed, every soul who ever longed for love and found only darkness.\n\nSome say you stay there forever. Cradled in that endless, spectral nursery, floating between forgiveness and oblivion.\n\nOthers say that if your guilt is too great, she lets you go—but only after your soul has been hollowed out and replaced with silence. You walk away as something else. Not a person. Not entirely. Just a shell. A cautionary tale in the making.\n\nThe Cradle Witch still walks.\n\nShe walks through sorrow. Through memory. Through shame.\n\nAnd when the night is too quiet, and your thoughts are too loud—when you rock yourself to sleep to escape what you’ve done—listen closely.\n\nBecause she might be rocking, too.\n\nAnd she never rocks alone."},"27":{"title":"The Room That Whispers Back","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kgqh25\/the_room_that_whispers_back\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Uglopi_2000","selftext":"\nThe Room That Whispers Back \n\nAs told by J.R.

I thought I knew where to draw the line between fiction and reality.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nWhat you’re about to read isn’t a story.\n\nIt’s a confession.\nIt’s a warning.\nIt’s the last thing I will ever write.\n\nIf anything happens to me—if I vanish, or if you find this file in some digital dead-end—please burn it. Don’t share it. Delete every copy. The more people read it, the more power it has.\n\nBecause this story… it feeds.\n\n\n---\n\nThe Room That Whispers Back\n\nThey say when you're alone long enough, the silence starts talking.\n\nI didn’t believe it until I moved into Apartment 3C.\n\nIt was cheap. Too cheap. But I was desperate—jobless, broke, barely holding onto reality after my sister vanished without a trace last fall. Nobody cared. “Adults go missing all the time,” the detective said, like that explained anything. But I knew she wouldn’t just disappear. Not like that.\n\nThe landlord of 3C didn’t ask questions. He just gave me the key with a crooked smile and said, “If the walls talk, don’t answer.”\n\nI thought it was a joke.\n\nThe first night was quiet. Too quiet. No creaks. No city noise. Just... stillness. As if the air was holding its breath. At 3:03 AM, I woke up choking—gasping for air. The room was ice-cold. The mirror on the dresser was fogged up from the inside. And written across it, backwards, was:\n“I see you.”\n\nI didn’t sleep.\n\nThe next day, I tried to clean the mirror. No matter what I used—soap, bleach, even scraping it with a razor—the words stayed. Not smudged. Just… there. Etched into the glass but only visible at night.\n\nEvery night after, more messages appeared.\n\n“Why didn’t you help her?”\n“She screamed for hours.”\n“You let her die.”\n\nI thought it was some cruel prank. Maybe someone hacked my phone, my apartment. I started locking everything. I sealed the mirror under blankets, but it didn’t matter. The words would bleed through. Then the whispering began.\n\nLow. Constant. Squelch. Squelch. Drip. Scrape. Laugh. Like a child giggling while something wet was being torn apart.\n\nOn the sixth night, I found fingernail scratches behind the closet. Hundreds of them. As if someone had been buried alive in the wall. Then I saw her.\n\nMy sister.\n\nShe was standing in the corner of the room, her back to me. Her hair was wrong—too long, too tangled. Her arms were bent in ways that shouldn't be possible. But it was her face that broke me: stitched shut at the mouth. Her eyes were wide with pain, begging.\n\nThen she spoke—not with her mouth, but inside my head.\n\n“He fed me to the room.”\n\nI moved to destroy it—burn the room, tear it apart. But I was too late.\n\nI was part of it now.\n\nThe room didn’t need bricks to trap you. It fed on guilt. On your guilt. Because deep down, I did let her die. I ignored her calls. I didn’t pick her up that night. She was scared, begging to come over. I was too busy. Too tired.\n\nThe room took her pain and made it eternal. And now, it’s feeding on mine.\n\nI haven’t left 3C in months. Or maybe years. Time doesn’t work here anymore. Every second stretches, looping, until it snaps. There’s no day, no night—only the mirror, the scratching, and the whispers that never stop.\n\nSometimes, the room lets me post online—little stories, fragments. To lure others. I think it feeds better when there are more eyes, more guilt, more screams echoing in the walls.\n\nSo if you’re reading this, don’t come looking for me.\n\nYou’ll find the room instead.\n\nAnd it’s hungry.\n\n---\n\nIf you think this is fiction—good. That means it hasn’t touched you yet. But if you hear it whisper when you're alone, if your mirror fogs up at 3:03 AM, if you see the words... don’t write back.\n\nDon’t answer the room.\n\nBecause if you do… it remembers your name.\n\nAnd it never lets go.\n\n"},"28":{"title":"Can someone help me find a pasta I read a long time ago?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kgo0ut\/can_someone_help_me_find_a_pasta_i_read_a_long\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Thecrowfan","selftext":"All I remember is the ending had this part in it\n\n \"that boy, now a young man,has never been found.

It wasn’t a sound, not exactly—just a pressure in my mind, like a whisper I couldn’t quite catch. I chalked it up to the move, the stress of starting over in a place where everyone seemed to know each other. But then I met the Johnsons.\n\r\nThey weren’t a family in the way you’d think. Not a single household with a picket fence, but a sprawling network of cousins, aunts, uncles, and in-laws that seemed to touch every corner of Ashbury. The barista at the coffee shop was a Johnson. The postman was a Johnson. The woman who smiled at me from the pew across the church aisle, her eyes lingering too long—she was a Johnson too. They were everywhere, woven into the town like threads in a quilt, and they all had that same look: warm, welcoming, but with an edge, like they knew something I didn’t.\r\nIt started with small things. Invitations to Sunday dinners at one of their homes, where the food was always perfect, the conversation always… directed. They’d ask about my past, my dreams, my fears, their questions so precise it felt like they were mapping my soul. I’d leave those dinners feeling lighter, like I’d unburdened myself, but also hollow, like I’d given something away I couldn’t name.\n\r\nThen the patterns emerged. My landlord, a Johnson, always seemed to know when I was struggling with rent before I said a word. A check would arrive, unsigned, with a note: “From the Kin.” My coworker, another Johnson, would finish my sentences, laugh at jokes I hadn’t told. The town’s librarian, a gray-haired Johnson with eyes like polished glass, handed me books I hadn’t asked for—self-help tomes, obscure philosophy, journals filled with handwritten notes about “belonging” and “the greater whole.” I’d find myself reading them late at night, the hum in my mind growing louder, more coherent, like a voice urging me to join.\n\r\nI tried to pull back. I stopped going to their dinners, ignored their calls. But the Johnsons didn’t push. They waited. And that was worse. The hum became a chorus, a rhythm that pulsed in my thoughts, shaping them. I’d catch myself humming their songs—old folk tunes I’d never heard before. I’d dream of their faces, their smiles, their hands reaching out, not to grab me but to guide me. In the dreams, I wasn’t alone. I was part of something vast, a family that stretched beyond Ashwick, beyond time, all connected by a single, unbreakable will.\n\r\nI confided in a friend from out of town, Sarah, over the phone. She laughed it off, said I was paranoid. But the next day, she texted me a photo: her standing next to a woman who looked just like the librarian, both smiling. The caption read, “Met your cousin! She’s a Johnson too.” Sarah stopped answering my calls after that.\n\r\nI went to the police, but the sheriff was a Johnson. He listened patiently, nodding, his smile never wavering. “You’re just feeling the weight of being alone,” he said. “We can fix that. You’re already one of us, you know.” I ran from the station, heart pounding, the hum so loud it drowned out my own thoughts.\n\r\nI started noticing the gaps. Memories that didn’t add up. I’d find photos in my apartment of me at Johnson gatherings I didn’t remember attending, my face beaming, my arm around people I didn’t know. My journal, which I kept locked, had new entries in my handwriting: “I’m home. I’m whole. I’m Kin.” My dreams weren’t dreams anymore—they were instructions. Step by step, thought by thought, the Johnsons were rewriting me.\r\nI tried to leave Ashwick. Packed a bag, got in my car. But every road looped back to the town square, where a crowd of Johnsons stood waiting, their faces serene, their eyes locked on me. They didn’t speak. They didn’t need to. The hum did it for them, a melody that sank into my bones, telling me I wasn’t leaving. I was arriving.\n\r\nI’m writing this from a diner on the edge of town, the only place I can think clearly, though the hum is still there, soft and insistent. The waitress, a Johnson, keeps refilling my coffee without asking. She’s humming, and I realize it’s the same tune I’ve been hearing in my head. My hands shake as I type, not from fear but from something worse—recognition. The hum isn’t just in me. It is me. My thoughts, my choices, my life—they’ve all been shaped, not by force but by a gentle, relentless pull, like a tide wearing down a stone.\n\r\nIf you’re reading this, you’ve already met them. The coworker who knows too much. The neighbor who’s too kind. The stranger whose smile makes your skin crawl, not because it’s wrong but because it’s right. They’re not a cult. They’re a family. And they want you to come home.\r\nThe hum is louder now. It’s not a sound. It’s a name. Johnson. And I’m starting to forget why I ever wanted to fight it\r\n\r"},"30":{"title":"My comment got 417 upvotes.

Our life was perfect until I discovered something horrible.** \n\nSo I was 18 years old at this time of my life and I wanted to marry someone really badly. I went to bars a lot to search for a woman suitable for me. I wanted a loving, caring and motherly woman who would care for our kids. \n\nI wanted to have at least two children. \n\nSo one night I went to this bar. I believe it was called Craig’s bar and restaurant. It was a nice small and cozy place where you could drink in peace and have good conversations with people without the music being too loud. There were people dancing on the dance floor. Then I spotted this beautiful woman.\n\n She was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. She had long hair that was a deep red colour. Amazing facial features and an astonishing body. I felt butterflies.  \n  \nI got nervous as I realized that I had to go talk to her. I shook off the nerves and approached her. ‘’ Hey, What’s up?’’ I started casually. Her answer took a while but then she said ‘’Nothing much. Just vibing’’. I could feel that she found me attractive. “Want to grab a drink with me?” I asked. Took a lot of courage to get those words out but I was glad I did. “Sure!” \n\nWe walked to the bar counter and I ordered a beer and she ordered a cider. After that we got ourselves a table and sat down. We talked about life and about everything. I fell in love, I could feel we had good chemistry and I asked for her number but she insisted that I’d spend the night at her place and so I did. Nothing sexual happened but we slept in the same bed and the conversation that started at the bar didn’t end until we fell asleep.  \n  \nHer name was Rosanne and she had really beautiful green eyes I couldn’t see at the bar. They almost looked like they belonged to a snake.\n\nThe next morning I woke up feeling like shit. “Heyy! You’re up” she yelled all excitedly. I flinched as I thought I was home alone. “Hey! you scared me,” I told her and barely got a word out as my mouth was so dry. “Did you sleep well?” I asked. “Yep” she told me and went to the kitchen.  \n  \nShe came back in 15 minutes and brought me breakfast to bed. ‘’Ohhh nice! Thank you so much’’ I said to her while giggling like a little kid.‘’I love cooking and I thought you deserved a homemade breakfast’’ She answered and blushed. So we spent the whole day in bed and I spent another night there. The next day I went home and talked to her on the phone. Actually after those two nights spent there I called her every day. We usually talked for a couple of hours and got to know each other so well. We also went on dates every other weekend. She was perfect for me. I wanted her to be my wife and soulmate for the rest of my life. I was also perfect for her or so I thought. It felt so sudden, how could I fall in love so quickly?\n\nA year goes by and it was awesome. I proposed and we got married. The wedding was small and modest. We invited only a handful of people and it went really well. It was simple but effective. At one point my wife disappeared and came back hours later. It was weird and a bit rude to the guests. Her dad came to me at one point and said ‘’Where is Rosanne? She always disappears at the worst moments.’’ Whatever that meant.  \n  \nShe seemed completely normal after she was back. At one point though I was sure I saw her pickup a frog and put it in her pocket. “What is she going to do with that?” I thought but left it at that. I figured she was just drunk and wanted to prank me as I was pretty drunk too.  I can’t even remember anything after that. The wedding was perfect.A month later we were out eating at a restaurant. ‘’How do you feel about having kids?’’ I asked.   \n  \nI had been thinking of having kids for six months and she would make the perfect mother. ‘’I don’t like kids. They are loud and they smell,’’ She answered. ‘’Have you thought about us having kids? I would love to have at least one,’’ I told her all excitedly. ‘’No my darling. I don’t think that is such a good idea,’’ she told me. I was dumbfounded.‘’What do you mean?’’ I asked. She told me that she can’t be around kids for some reason but I deserved them and some day she would be ready. The woman I married didn’t want kids with me, why?  \n  \nWe left the conversation at that. I kept thinking about it for a couple of weeks but figured out she would tell me when she was ready for kids. \n\nAfter that night she woke me up by bringing me breakfast. ‘’Good morning my handsome prince’’ She said and gave me a plate full of eggs. bacon and beans. ‘’That was really kind of you my dear’’ I told her while smiling very widely. She always made me breakfast on the weekends. It was the best.\n\nThe next week, my wife disappeared again. It was Saturday and we watched a movie on our couch. Suddenly she leaves in a hurry and the weirdest thing is that she didn’t even say anything, she just left. She came back 3 hours later. It was almost midnight and that was weird.  \n  \nI was just watching the movie alone when all of a sudden I heard. “Babe, want to go upstairs?” I jumped so high that I hit my head on the lamp. “Woah, where did you go?” I asked while visibly annoyed. “Don’t worry about it my darling” She calmly told me.  \n  \nI did not go upstairs with her that night as I was pretty mad at her for leaving during the date night we had planned. I slept on the couch that night and I reconsidered our relationship the whole night.I kept debating with myself about whether I should stay or leave as this was deeply unsettling. It was a huge red flag,  \n  \nI had thoughts about her cheating on me but I married her so I trusted her and it was just a passing thought. \n\nThe next week a similar thing happened. We were supposed to go eat dinner at a restaurant. I had reserved a table at a very high end restaurant. I was excited because I saved a lot of money for this specific date night. As we are leaving to the restaurant she says “I need to use the bathroom, go start the car.” I do just that and around 15 minutes go by. I began to wonder, where is she? How is she taking so long? \n\nI waited another 15 minutes. Nothing. She didn’t come back so I decided to go check out what is going on and why is she taking so long.\n\nI went inside and walked upstairs to our bedroom. I thought she would be there putting on more makeup or doing some finishing touches, maybe even doing her hair over and over. I walk in and she’s not there. Only thing I see are her clothes on the floor.   \n  \nThe same clothes she was supposed to put on for our date. “Why are these on the floor?” I thought. It was bizarre that she would do this on our date night and it was not the first time either. \n\nI started to look around the house but she was nowhere to be seen. I walk in the kitchen and I hear this weird hissing sound coming from under me. The basement, why would she be there? There was nothing in there and no reason for her to go inside the basement.  \n  \nI walked the stairs to the basement and it was dark. It also smelled really funky. It was very warm and humid there. That was not the case earlier.  Then I hear some movement behind me and look over there. It’s dark but I have a flashlight so I turn it on. ‘’hisssss’’ It hissed at me. The half snake half woman hissed at me.‘’What the fuck!’’ I yelled at the monster who turned out to be my wife. The puzzle just clicked and that’s where she always disappeared to.  \n  \n‘’Don’t look at me’’ She said with this raspy, snake-like voice.  \n  \n‘’How could you hide this from me?’’ I asked while getting angry at her for hiding this.  \n  \n‘’I thought you would leave me if you knew,’’ She told me.   \n  \n‘’Is there a way out of this? Is this a curse?’’ I wanted to figure out how this was even possible.   \n  \n‘’It’s a curse that can’t be lifted,’’ she answered. ‘’ I can’t be saved. Please kill me and stop this madness’’ Rosanne said while starting to weep.   \n  \nI thought about it for a while. She returned to human form and we talked this through. She did not want to live anymore because every time she turned into a snake. She got this hunger for human souls and she told me she prefers to feast on younger people as their souls are more pure than grown humans. I had to think about the situation and what could be done.  \n  \nEvery night I had these nightmares of her stealing children and feasting on their souls. It was terrifying to think about. I kept going back and forth between killing her and helping her.   \n  \nYou are thinking ‘’Why would he help her?’’ I know it sounds bad but I got that idea because she was perfect.  \n  \nWe had a nice relationship and I never had to worry about anything after coming home from work. She kept the house clean and made me dinner. I couldn’t make my decision then and there. I needed to think it through.  \n  \nOne day we talked about the situation on our hands and she told me how and why she was cursed. She told me that when she was younger her parents were homeless and wanted to get stability in their lives.  \n  \nThey found this mysterious ad on a lamp post and it was about some shaman helping people get what they want. So her parents went to visit that shaman and they got an offer. They would get everything they ever wanted but it would cost them their first ten thousand euros. It was clear the money had to be their first ten thousand ever. They accepted but didn't know what would happen if they didn’t pay him. She told me that because they were homeless after they got the money they totally forgot that deal made with the shaman. \n\nThe shaman never told them what would happen if they would not pay him. Soon they found out. As her mother gave birth to my wife she was healthy and all was well but by the time she turned five. She would turn into this half snake half human form. Her parents did not know what to do. It was not natural and so they remembered the shaman who helped them out of poverty. As they visited the shaman he told them that it was too late to do anything and it was all their fault for not following their deal. My wife got cursed by that shaman because her parents forgot to pay him.   \n  \nHearing this made me want to help her even more. She did not cause this and deserved a good life. A good life that was ruined by her parents' actions. One day, exactly 5 days after what happened I was walking on the street and I saw this poster of a shaman offering spiritual readings. I got an idea and went to visit that shaman as soon as I could. I located his cottage which was a little hard to find but I managed to find it. I knocked on the door. He opened the door and he looked old, really old. He looked like he was over 90 years old.\n\nI then asked him about the situation and he told me that he was the shaman who helped those homeless people. He also told me the same story my wife did and that gave me a little  bit of hope.  \n  \nHe spoke very calmly and was not one bit angry.  \n  \nHe told me that there could be a cure but he had to check from some book, so I waited.   \n  \n30 minutes go by and he comes back. I can feel that the thing he found is not good. ‘’There is no cure or any way to reverse this,’’ He told me. He also said that it was a strong curse because they had made a deal. Once the parents and the shaman both agreed her fate was set. That felt so wrong, I had so much hope in me. That was all for nothing. I still decided to stay with her and not let her die. It was not an option.  Before leaving the shaman's hut he said something weird. ‘’A person’s love is the only thing capable of removing something this horrifying’’. I didn’t answer and just left.  \n  \nI walked back home feeling pretty low. I could not get that sadness to go away. It was a 15 minute walk and I kept thinking about what would happen and how we could cure her.  \n  \nI got to the front door and opened it. The house was really quiet, no sounds at all. ‘’Rosanne’’ I shouted but no answer. I walked up to our bedroom and there she was. She was laying on the bed and there was blood all over her. I started to cry as I realized she had done what I couldn’t.   \n  \nThere was a note beside her and I read that. In that note she told me how much she loved me and how great I was. She also apologized for doing this but she could not endanger anyone anymore. She also told me that we would get married in the next life.  \n  \nI read it and with each word I cried louder. I just kept having these flashbacks of all the good things we did together. All the late night walks, dancing at our wedding, dreaming about moving to another country and all the late night laughs we had before falling asleep together.  \n  \nI lost everything that night.  I lost her, the brightest light in this world of darkness. I still have her clothes in my closet and I still can’t let go."},"32":{"title":"Satisfaction","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kggva1\/satisfaction\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Zestyclose_Math6296","selftext":"**He watches. He always watches.**  \nDays are spent in silence. Weeks in shadows.  \nChoosing is sacred. Once he picks, he learns — their habits, their routes, their weak spots.  \nThis one? A family on a quiet suburban street. Perfect.  \nA smiling mother who hums while she waters the garden.  \nA cheerful father who kisses her cheek before work and laughs with his children at dinner.  \nTwo teenagers — a boy who slams doors, a girl who dances with her headphones in.  \nHe knows the times they leave. When they sleep.  \nHe knows how the house breathes when it’s quiet.  \nHe knows how they’ll die.\n\nOr did he?  \nIt depended on how he felt at the time.  \nIf they seemed innocent — truly innocent — it would be quick.  \nA single, clean cut. Light out. Quiet.  \nBut if they felt *wrong*... unclean…  \nThen the cut wouldn’t be quick.  \nWouldn’t be precise.  \nMaybe he’d miss. Maybe he’d have to cut again. And again.  \nMaybe the light would drain from them slowly.  \n**Beautifully slow.**  \nThere was beauty in the struggle. In watching the mask slip.  \nSome deaths felt like music.\n\nHe sat.  \nAnd he watched.  \nAnd he waited.  \nIn his watching, he learned.  \nThe household was always quiet by midnight. Still.  \nLike a painting left unattended.  \nEvery night — from midnight until dawn — the house belonged to silence.  \nAnd so he waited for it.  \nHe waited for *his* time.  \nHis moment to choose.  \nTo choose how their light would go out.\n\nMidnight came.  \nHe moved quickly, but with care.  \n**“Move like you’re meant to be there.”**  \nThat was one of the first techniques he’d learned. One of the oldest rules.  \nWalk with purpose. Never slink. Never skulk.  \nPeople don’t notice confidence. They turn away from it. They assume they’re safe.  \nHe’d used it a dozen times before. It never failed.  \nHe reached the threshold of the house — the quiet little place with trimmed hedges and fairy lights still strung on the porch.  \nHe peered in through the window.  \nDark.  \nStill.  \nJust like always.\n\nBut something was different.  \nThe father was sitting in the lazy boy lounger.  \nEyes closed.  \nAsleep?  \nYes… asleep, he thought.  \nHe watched. Waited. No movement. Not even a twitch.  \nNo shift in breath. No unconscious stir.  \nStill, he was content. It was time.  \nHe moved to the front door, eyes scanning the rock garden beside it.  \nHe remembered — the boy, once, had forgotten his key. He’d come out, frustrated, and taken a spare from one of the fake rocks.  \nThe killer crouched, feeling the stones. One by one.  \nMost were real. Cold. Uneven.  \nBut one… one felt wrong.  \nHe picked it up, turned it over.  \nClick.  \nIt split.  \nHe smiled.  \nThe key slid into his palm like it was meant to be there.  \nHe stood. Inserted it into the lock.  \nTurned.  \nThe door opened without a sound.\n\nHe chose.  \nFrom his coat, he pulled out several zip ties.  \nQuietly, carefully, he made his way to the father.  \nThe man hadn’t moved — not a twitch.  \nKneeling beside him, the killer bound his feet first.  \nNo reaction.  \nThen his hands — they were already clasped together, like in prayer.  \nZip.  \nTight.  \nThe father stirred. Eyes opened.  \n“Hush, hush,” the killer whispered.  \nThe father said nothing.  \nNot a word. Not a sound.\n\nThe killer moved to the window and drew the curtains closed. The streetlight faded. The room became theirs.  \n“You have such a beautiful, warm family,” he said softly, like he meant it.  \nHe pulled a strip of duct tape from the roll and pressed it across the father's mouth.  \nThen he stepped back. Looked into the man’s eyes.\n\nThis was the part he always loved.  \nThe moment they realised. The moment the fear began to rise — a living, breathing thing behind their eyes.  \nTerror.  \nDespair.  \nThe understanding of what *was coming*.\n\nBut he didn’t see any of that.\n\nJust... blankness.  \nStillness.  \nLike a man already *gone*.\n\nHe paid it no mind.  \nSometimes men just couldn’t believe this was happening to them.  \nThey were too powerful. Too in control.  \n*Protectors.*  \nThis didn’t happen to men like them.  \nThey were too aware. Too vigilant.  \nSo the blankness in the father’s eyes? It was denial. That’s all.  \nThe fear would come. It always did.\n\nHe turned toward the stairs.  \nTook each step carefully, minding the creaks, letting the silence swallow him.  \nUpstairs was where the real fun began.\n\nHe moved slowly.  \n*Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.*  \nEach step deliberate. Each breath measured.  \nHe crested the stairs and scanned the corridor.\n\nFour doors.  \nTwo were covered in stickers and posters — teenage rooms.  \nOne bore a flowery bouquet nailed dead-centre.  \nThe last was blank. Plain. Master bedroom.  \nThat was the one.\n\nHe made his way toward it, methodical and quiet.  \nAs he moved, the air seemed to change.  \nMetallic.  \nThick.  \nBut he pushed that out of his mind. Or rather — the *thrill* pushed it aside for him.  \nThe hunt was on. That was all that mattered now.\n\nHe placed his gloved hand on the doorknob.  \nTurned.  \nThe door creaked open into pitch darkness.\n\nHe crept toward the bed.  \nOne figure. A body lying still, beneath the covers.  \nThe silhouette said *mother*. On her back. Calm.\n\nHe moved closer.  \nExcitement surged in him like electricity.  \nAlmost giddy.\n\n*No. Slow down.*  \n*You get too excited, you make mistakes.*  \nHis teeth were on edge.

No pleading. No trembling hands or whispered prayers.  \nJust *waste*.\n\nHe turned and stormed down the hallway.  \nFirst: the boy’s room — stickers of skaters and basketball players on the door.  \nHe opened it.\n\nSame scene.  \nEyes open.  \nThroat cut.  \nAlready gone.\n\nNext: the girl’s room.  \nSame.\n\nAnother corpse.  \nMore silence.  \nNot his silence.\n\nHe stood there, heart pounding — not with excitement, but with **rage**.\n\n*Wasted.*  \nWasted time.  \nWasted planning.  \nWasted fear.\n\nHe stormed down the stairs, fury crackling through every step.  \nOnly one ember of this household remained.  \nOnly one soul left to extinguish.\n\nHe still sat bound and gagged, just as the killer had left him. But something had changed.\n\nThe killer rounded on the father, locking eyes with him. The blankness was gone. In its place burned a fire.\n\nNot rage.

Her eyesight might not have been as sharp as it once was, but she had a keen sense for finding treasures that time had overlooked. On a lazy Sunday afternoon, she perused through the clutter of Mrs. Thompson's yearly yard sale, her curiosity piqued by the sight of a well-worn Super Nintendo game tucked between a stack of romance novels and a chipped vase. The cartridge's label was a faded yellow, but the image of the iconic plumber was unmistakable. She picked it up, squinting at the title: \"Super Mario World.\"\n\n\n\nEdna had heard her grandson, Timmy, speak fondly of the game. He had one of those newfangled consoles now, but she knew he cherished the classics. She bought it for fifty cents and walked back home with a spring in her step, eager to surprise him. She found him in his room, eyes glued to a game on his modern gadget, but the moment she held up the cartridge, his eyes lit up like Christmas. He took it from her gently, as if handling a rare artifact.\n\n\n\nThey set it up in his old room, where his dusty Super Nintendo still held court. The TV screen flickered to life as Timmy blew into the cartridge and slid it into the slot, the familiar sound of it locking into place sending a wave of nostalgia through him. But when he hit the power button, the screen remained black. He tried again, and again, each time the anticipation building, only to be met with the cold silence of a broken device.\n\n\n\nFeeling a twinge of disappointment, Timmy looked over at Edna, who was watching him intently. \"Maybe it's just a dud,\" she said, her voice tinged with regret for raising his hopes. But something in the way the game lay in the console, something about its weight, it's almost imperceptible hum, made Timmy feel like it was more than that. He decided to give it one last shot.\n\n\n\nThis time, when the power surged through the system, the screen flickered into a kaleidoscope of colors before settling into something eerily different. The familiar Mario tune was replaced by a discordant melody, and the bright, cheery world of his childhood gave way to a pixelated landscape of darkness and shadow. The plumber's image had morphed into something sinister, his eyes glowing red, and his smile, twisted into a snarl. Timmy's heart skipped a beat as the game began to play without any input from the controller. He looked over at Edna, but she had vanished, leaving him alone with the malevolent game that seemed to have a mind of its own.\n\n\n\nThe game's protagonist, no longer the heroic Mario, moved through the corrupted world with a sense of urgency. The once-friendly creatures of the Mushroom Kingdom had become twisted and aggressive, attacking the screen as if trying to claw their way out. Timmy felt a cold sweat break out on his forehead as he watched in horror, his fingers frozen on the unresponsive controller. He tried to switch the game off, but the power button on the console had faded away, leaving him no way to escape the nightmare unfolding before his eyes.\n\n\n\nThe room grew colder, the walls seeming to close in as the game's disturbing sounds filled the air. A chill wind blew through the house, rustling the curtains and sending a shiver down Timmy's spine. He tried to call out to his grandmother, but his voice was lost in the cacophony of digital screams. The game grew more intense, the screen flickering faster and the colors deepening to almost black, with only the red eyes of the creature that was once Mario to guide him through the chaos.\n\n\n\nThe creature approached a castle, its once-inviting spires now jagged and menacing. Timmy knew he had to do something, had to stop this before it was too late. Summoning his courage, he leaned in closer, willing himself into the game. And with a sudden jolt, he found himself standing in the pixelated world, the cold winds of the game whipping around him. He looked down and saw his own hands, but they were covered in the blocky, 16-bit style of the game. He took a deep breath and picked up the controller, his heart racing as he realized he had become a part of the very game that had once brought him so much joy, now transformed into a terrifying realm of unknown dangers.\n\n\n\nThe creature-Mario took notice of him, its eyes narrowing. The tension grew as the two stared at each other, the air thick with malice. Timmy's heart pounded in his chest, his palms slick with sweat. He knew he had to act, to regain control of the game that had somehow ensnared him. He took a step forward, his legs wobbly and unresponsive. The creature mirrored his movement, a silent challenge in its stance. Timmy swallowed hard, his thumbs trembling as he tried to remember the simple button combinations that had once brought him victory.\n\n\n\nA door creaked open, revealing a room filled with flickering torches. The creature-Mario snarled, charging towards him. Timmy's instincts took over, and he jumped, his heart racing as he heard the familiar \"boing\" sound of his digital avatar's leap. The creature's attack missed, and Timmy felt a flicker of hope. He knew he had to reach the castle's core, to find some way to reset the game to its original state. The creature followed closely, its movements erratic and unpredictable, as if driven by a malevolent force beyond Timmy's comprehension.\n\n\n\nThe castle's corridors grew narrower, the shadows deeper. Timmy's eyes darted from side to side, searching for any sign of his grandmother or a way out. The air was thick with a sense of foreboding, the walls seeming to pulse with a sinister energy. His heart was in his throat as he ventured deeper, the creature's red eyes never leaving him. The music grew louder, more frenetic, until it was all he could hear, a cacophony of dread that matched the hammering in his chest.\n\n\n\nAs he approached the throne room, the creature-Mario lunged at him again, and Timmy's hands moved of their own accord. He slammed the A button, and to his astonishment, the creature transformed into a giant fireball, hurtling towards the castle's dark heart. The room trembled with the force of the impact, and the walls began to crumble around him. Timmy felt a sudden surge of power, the game's glitches and corruptions swirling around him like a maelstrom of pixels. The screen flashed white, and for a moment, everything went quiet.\n\n\n\nAnd then, with a jolt, Timmy was back in his room, the TV screen flickering off and the console powering down. He looked around, bewildered, the cold sweat drying on his skin. His grandmother's worried face appeared in the doorway. \"Timmy, what happened?\" she called out, her voice filled with concern. He turned to her, the reality of his situation setting in. The game cartridge lay shattered on the floor; the pieces scattered like the remnants of a shattered memory.\n\n\n\nTimmy took a deep breath, his heart still racing from the ordeal. He knew he had to tell her the truth, to explain the horrors he had witnessed within the game. But as he opened his mouth, the words caught in his throat. What could he say? How could he explain the unexplainable? He looked at the pieces of the cartridge, feeling a strange mix of relief and loss. The game was no more, but the memory of its dark twin remained, a chilling reminder that sometimes, the past is better left untouched."},"34":{"title":"The Silence That Took Me","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kgfg8t\/the_silence_that_took_me\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"postfunny1","selftext":"The Silence That Took Me\nBy terrible020\nIt started with a curious conversation. It was just a conversation, at a coffee shop with some friends. We were laughing, trading stories about work, bad dates, the usual stuff. But then, mid-sentence, I realized I had nothing left to say. Nothing. My mind went blank, like a radio losing signal. Flatlined. I tried to grab onto a thought—any thought—but there was nothing. Just static. And nothing.\nI smiled, nodded, and sipped my coffee to cover it up. My friends didn’t notice. They kept chatting, their voices blending into a dull hum. I stared at the table, at the grain of the wood, and felt myself… slip. Not physically, but like my mind was a kite cut loose, drifting away. I was still there, but I wasn’t. I was zoning out, further than I’d ever gone before. Panicking.\nThat was the first time.\nIt kept on happening. At work, I’d sit in meetings, watching lips move, hearing words but not processing anything. I’d try to speak, to contribute, but my thoughts were empty. I’d stare at my computer screen, the cursor blinking, mocking me, laughing at me. Emails went unanswered. My boss asked if I was okay, and I said, “Yeah, just tired.” But I wasn’t tired. I was gone.\nAt home, things got worse. I’d sit on the couch, TV on, but the screen was just colors and noise. I’d scroll my phone, but the posts, the memes, the news—they meant nothing. I’d open my mouth to call a friend, to say something, but no words came. It was like my voice had been stolen, not by force, but by absence. Like it had slipped into the same void where my thoughts went.\nOne night, I looked in the mirror, and I didn’t recognize myself. Not my face—it was still me, same eyes, same nose. But the spark was gone. My eyes were empty, like windows to a house no one lived in. I tried to say my name, to anchor myself, but my lips wouldn’t move. The silence was heavy, pressing against my chest, filling the room.\nThat’s when I heard it. A whisper, not from outside, but from inside my head. It wasn’t words, not exactly—just a low, constant murmur, like a crowd talking too far away to make out. It wasn’t threatening, but it wasn’t friendly either. It was… indifferent. Like it didn’t care if I listened or not. But it was there, always, filling the space where my thoughts used to be.\nI stopped going out. Friends texted, called, left voicemails. “Where are you? You okay?” I wanted to answer, but my fingers wouldn’t type, my voice wouldn’t come. The texts piled up, unread. The world kept moving, but I was stuck, sinking deeper into the silence.\nOne night, I sat in my apartment, lights off, staring at the wall. The murmur in my head was louder now, not words but a presence, like something was sitting in the room with me. I felt it watching, not with eyes, but with attention. I tried to scream, to break the silence, but my throat was dry, my voice gone. The air felt thick, like it was pressing me down, swallowing me.\nI don’t know when it happened, but at some point, I wasn’t in my apartment anymore. I was nowhere. Not a place, not a void—just… nothing. I could still see, still think, but it wasn’t me doing it. It was like I was a passenger in my own body, watching from far away. My hands moved, but I wasn’t moving them. My mouth spoke, but I wasn’t speaking. Someone—or something—was living my life, wearing my skin.\nI saw it through my own eyes, like a movie I couldn’t turn off. It went to my job, smiled at my coworkers, answered emails. It met my friends, laughed at their jokes, told stories I didn’t remember living. They didn’t notice anything wrong. To them, it was me. But I was gone, trapped in the silence, watching from the void.\nSometimes, I try to fight, to claw my way back. I scream, but no one hears. I reach for my thoughts, but they slip through my fingers like smoke. The murmur is always there, louder now, drowning out what’s left of me. It’s not cruel, not kind—it just is. And every day, I feel myself fade a little more, like a signal growing weaker.\nI don’t know what it wants. I don’t know if it’s a thing, a force, or just… what happens when you run out of things to say. But I know this: it’s not just me. I see it in others now, in the empty eyes of strangers on the street, in the hollow laughs at crowded bars. They’re zoning out, slipping away, and something else is stepping in.\nIf you’re reading this, listen. If you ever feel your words dry up, your thoughts go quiet, don’t let it take you. Fight. Say something, anything, even if it’s nonsense. Hold onto your voice, your spark, because once it’s gone, you’re not just silent. You’re erased.\nAnd the silence is hungry.\n"},"35":{"title":"The Enterprise Where I Work Almost Killed Me","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kgfeld\/the_enterprise_where_i_work_almost_killed_me\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Alarming_Mousse3808","selftext":"I never gave a damn about the monsters in the region, just because I had never seen any of them, even though this is the city with the highest number of occurrences in the world. We're living in a time when these events are becoming common. We don't even know their origin. Their behavior gives nightmares to the greatest specialist in exotic creatures in the world. They don’t follow any pattern, so it’s almost impossible to locate their burrows. I’ve never seen a report from a survivor — almost as if there weren’t any.\n\nThat’s why I’m writing this report. This is my story with one of those terrifying creatures.\n\nIt was a Monday. Gray clouds were covering the sky, and it was cold. I didn't care. I changed my clothes and started making a cup of coffee to fully wake up. Everything was fine. I put on an overcoat, grabbed my umbrella, suitcase, and lucky fountain pen (it's a long story, which is not important now), and placed my hat on my head. Only then did I head to work.\n\nWhen I arrived at BioCorps, I immediately noticed that something was off. The building was completely empty, and the air was filled with a horrible smell. Normally, it would be bustling with people at that hour. “Or am I late?” I checked my watch. It was really dark inside of the building, but I could see it was 7 a.m. Some lights were flickering. I looked at a wall. A dark liquid was smeared across it. “Is it…”, I thought, connecting the dots with the smell, “Is it… blood?\" I ran through Corridor 13 of Sector A, where my office is located, but before I could enter, I noticed something strange: my supervisor’s door was open.\n\nIt was unusual to see Dr. Smith’s door open. He was very reserved with his employees. Over the past month, he’d been showing up to work really messy — hair uncombed, suit wrinkled, and a haunted expression on his face. My natural curiosity overcame my fear. I had to know what was going on.\n\nI stepped inside his office.\n\n“It’s rare to see anyone passing by,” said my colleague and best friend, Walter, who was hiding under the desk and staring at Dr. Smith’s chalkboard. “Good to see you’re alive, Gregory.”Something was off about him. He was unnervingly calm — too calm. I think he was traumatized.\n\n\"Walter, are you okay? Are you hurt? I saw blood on the walls, and—\" I began, but Walter slowly raised his index finger to his lips, signaling for silence, and pointed behind me.\n\nI felt a chill run through my body as something sniffed the back of my neck. Slowly, I turned around.\n\nThat’s when I saw a terrifying pair of eyes. Fuck, I can’t forget those eyes.\n\nThey belonged to a giant red-scaled lizard, with shreds of flesh hanging from its bloody jaws. It had threatening wings like a bat. As it sniffed, it exhaled smoke through its nostrils. I could hear it smelling. When it turned its head and saw us, it roared — unleashing a blast of pure fire.\n\nOnly then did I realize it was the source of both the smell and the silence. I wanted to scream, to cry, but I was frozen.\n\n“He can hear us,” Walter gestured silently. I was so deceiving I barely noticed I had crouched under the desk beside him.\n\nThen I looked at the chalkboard. Genetic sequences covered it. Tables tracked numbers of “failures” and “successes,” with questions like “wrong sequence?” and “wrong machines?”\n\nBut that wasn’t what caught my attention. Repeated over and over again were the words:\n\n“I WOULD HAVE THE NOBEL.”\n\nHorrified, I watched as the creature left the room. After I was certain it was far away, I said:\n\n“We need to get out of here, Walter!”\n\n“What? Are you nuts?” he nearly shouted. “That monster will kill us both if we leave this room! We’re safer here!”\n\n“That’s exactly why we need to get out—”\n\nThe creature suddenly appeared.\n\nFor a few horrifying moments, the silence nearly killed me. Then, the creature left again.\n\n“‘Secure,’ huh?” I muttered. “Look, if you want to stay, stay. I won’t stop you. But I’m leaving.”\n\n“Good luck,” he said, looking at me.\n\nI nodded back at him.\n\nI ran through all of Sector A until I reached the reception door.\n\nThe door to my freedom.\n\nOf course, I had to run to it—but the scaled freak appeared again, stopping me in my tracks. It didn’t move. It just stared at me. Unblinking. Minutes passed.\n\nThen it approached.\n\nIts tail stood erect, its medium-length arms extended toward me. Down the metal corridor, the creature’s low growls echoed. And I, like a complete idiot, just listened—frozen, unreactive.\n\nThen, it started walking.\n\nBut the monster’s nose appeared just behind my neck. It opened its mouth, revealing rows of sharp, glistening teeth. At that moment, I had nothing to gain and everything to lose.\n\nI slammed the button.\n\nA blaring, ear-piercing alarm echoed through the corridor, distracting the creature. It worked — the monster turned away, trying to locate the source of the terrible, deafening melody. And that same noise announced something else: it was my chance to escape.\n\nI ran down the corridor with everything I had.\n\nBut it saw me.\n\nThose terrible, piercing red eyes locked onto mine and froze me in place. I realized then — this could be the end.\n\nThink about it: would a six-foot-tall man stand a chance in a fight against an eight-foot-tall monster that literally breathes fire?\n\nNo? You’re absolutely right.\n\nI was hurled against the wall and blacked out for a few seconds.\n\nWhen I came to, I felt a deep cut in my abdomen and saw blood smeared on the wall beside me. My lucky fountain pen was lying on the floor. I needed a plan B.\n\nI grabbed the pen, stood up, and ran straight at the monster — despite the excruciating pain in my side. Then, I stabbed his left red-orange eye with the pen. The monster yelled, and threw up a lot of fire. It was struggling from pain, and I lost my pen in the restless head of it.\n\nThe next thing I saw was terrifying. I saw the BioCorps's logo tattooed on the creature’s scaled neck.\n\nNow everything makes sense.\n\nIt was Dr. Smith to command the creation of the monsters. He was trying to perform the creation of a creature, and he has been creating all of the monsters. That’s why we never saw a burrow of them, just because there isn't. The creatures are created in the labs and they are killed briefly after being born. Dr. Smith failed most of the time, so he went crazy. That’s why he left his door closed, to cover his secrets, and…\n\nBLAM!\n\nI didn't notice its claw, big enough to keep me on the ground. It growled. I was stuck. The creature lifted me with its claw and launched me across the corridor. I blacked out for a minute, I think.\n\nThe only eye remaining in the creature’s head looked at me. I knew I was fucked up. I tried to get up with all my strength. No success. My abdomen was severely hurt.\n\n\"ARGH\", I yelled from pain, \"Help!\"\n\nThe monster approached. \n\n\"Help!\"\n\n\"Hey, you freak!\", it was... Walter? \"I bet you taste like chicken!\", if you looked at him, you could see he was taken by the fear.\n\nRAAAAR!, the monster turned to Walter, who was holding a curtain holster.\n\n\"Walter.\", my voice was so weak, and I was bleeding. I was losing consciousness.\n\nThe last thing I remember was that they started to fight. Walter was hurled against the wall and the monster started eating his intestines. I heard the sound of sirens from out of the building. After that, darkness.\n\nI woke up in an ambulance. I gasped.\n\n\"Help...\"\n\n\"Hey, hey, calm down.\", a paramedic put a inhaler in my face and I went out.\n\nWhen I woke up again, I was in a hospital room. A medic was administering morphine for me.\n\n\"Where... Where is Walter?\", I asked.\n\n\"Walter?\", he didn't understand. \n\n\"The other guy, who was fighting the creature.\"\n\nThe medic's face became dark.\n\n\"Huh... The police killed that reptile... We could save you, but the other mas didn't have this luck. We tried to save him, but he was fatally harmed by the creature.\"\n\nI think I was pale at this moment.\n\n\"But, hey...\", he tried to smile, \"You're alive. This is good news, a survivor of these attacks. Maybe you could help to end this cycle. Do you know the origin of this monster?\"\n\n\"It was BioCorps.\", I said.\n\nHis face was dark again.\n\n\"What?\"\n\"Biocorps created the monsters. It had the BioCorps's logo on its neck.\"\n\nThe doctor smiled.\n\n\"Have some rest. This story is over.\"\n\nHe didn't believe in me. Probably, he thought I was having some hallucination, or PTSD. I don’t know and don’t give a fuck.\n\nThis is the truth. The painful truth.\n\nWalter was my best friend. Biocorps, the enterprise where we worked, killed him and gave me scars forever. My supervisor's obsession caused it. Speaking about the devil, he is missing. But, now, I know my mission. I'll find him.\n\nI'll have my revenge.\n"},"36":{"title":"The Polyamory Experiment by Nicholas Leonard","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kgf4ek\/the_polyamory_experiment_by_nicholas_leonard\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"poetnicholasleonard","selftext":"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1tbjgmVGhdzf36NtRQwDxVApCkkgEYo3EwJjTWuy8oAE\/edit?usp=drivesdk\n\nI haven’t posted this one before.

Marcus squinted at the cover, recognizing the iconic orange bandicoot and his cartoony rivals on the cover.\n\n\n\n\"Crash Team Racing? Dude, this is a classic,\" Marcus said, a nostalgic smile playing on his lips.\n\n\n\n\"No, not just any classic,\" Jake insisted, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. \"This one's... special.\"\n\n\n\nMarcus raised an eyebrow, glancing at the game's label. It looked like it had been peeled off and slapped back on, the edges jagged and the glue smudging the plastic. The game's title was barely legible, as if someone had tried to scrub it off.\n\n\n\n\"I got it from this weird guy in a Crash costume,\" Jake continued. \"He was lurking around the game store, said it was a rare edition. Some kind of... I dunno, collector's item or something.\"\n\n\n\nThe guy at the counter had shrugged it off, said it was probably some old promo copy that got lost in the back of a warehouse. But something about the way the costume had stared at him, those dead, hollow eyes peering out from behind the mask, had given Marcus the creeps.\n\n\n\n\"What's so special about it?\" Marcus asked, turning the game over in his hands.\n\n\n\nJake leaned in closer, his eyes gleaming with the thrill of a good campfire tale. \"Apparently, it's got this hidden track. 'Blood Road'. Supposedly, you can only access it after winning every race in the game. And if you do...\"\n\n\n\nThe room grew quiet as Jake paused for dramatic effect, the only sound the distant hum of traffic outside the dorm room window. Marcus's curiosity was piqued, his thumb tracing the unfamiliar button combination scribbled on the back of the case.\n\n\n\n\"If you do,\" Jake whispered, \"the game... changes. The tracks get darker, the characters... weirder. And it's not just the visuals, man. It's like the game itself gets... angry.\"\n\n\n\nMarcus chuckled, shaking his head. \"You're messing with me, right?\"\n\n\n\nJake's grin slipped, his expression turning serious. \"Nah, I swear. It's like the game comes alive or something. And if you win on Blood Road...\"\n\n\n\nHe paused again, his eyes darting around the room as if afraid someone might be listening in.\n\n\n\n\"If you win,\" Jake finally continued, his voice barely above a murmur, \"the game... it rewards you. But nobody who's played it will say what that reward is. They just get all quiet and refuse to talk about it.\"\n\n\n\nMarcus's amusement faded, replaced by a tingle of unease that danced along his spine. He looked at the game again, the cartoonish images seeming to shift and distort before his eyes.\n\n\n\n\"Well, I guess there's only one way to find out,\" he said, sliding the disc into his PlayStation. The console whirred to life, and the screen flickered with the familiar startup sequence.\n\n\n\nBut as the game loaded, the colors grew darker, the music more sinister. Marcus swallowed hard, his heart racing as the once-friendly faces of Crash and his friends twisted into grotesque expressions of rage and fear.\n\n\n\nHe glanced at Jake, who nodded solemnly. \"You're about to enter a whole new level of racing, buddy,\" he said. \"Good luck.\"\n\n\n\nThe game's menu popped up, the words 'BLOOD ROAD' pulsing ominously at the bottom. Marcus took a deep breath, his grip tightening around the controller. As he selected the new track, the room grew cold, the air thick with the scent of something ancient and malevolent.\n\n\n\nThe race began, and Marcus was immediately thrown into a nightmare world, the bright colors of the usual tracks replaced by a twisted landscape of shadows and crimson. His cart raced through the hellish terrain, dodging obstacles that seemed to bleed onto the screen.\n\n\n\nThe other racers had changed too, their eyes now filled with a hunger that made his stomach turn. The cheery banter of the original game was replaced with guttural snarls and the sound of chains clanking together. Marcus's heart hammered in his chest as he pushed the pedal to the metal, the engine of his kart roaring like a beast.\n\n\n\nThe track itself was a labyrinth of jumps, twists, and turns that seemed to defy physics. Each corner revealed a new horror: a skull-shaped obstacle spewing forth a river of blood, or a once-friendly fruit that now had teeth, chomping at the air as he sped by. Marcus's knuckles turned white as he gripped the controller, his eyes darting back and forth as he navigated the treacherous path.\n\n\n\nThe game played out like a feverish dream. The other racers, now grotesque monsters, taunted him from the screen, their voices distorted beyond recognition. He could almost feel their hot breath on the back of his neck as they closed in for the kill.\n\n\n\nSweat beaded on Marcus's brow, and the room around him grew colder still. The air was thick with an otherworldly pressure, making each breath feel like he was inhaling ice. The TV flickered erratically, and the light from the screen cast eerie shadows across the room that danced and shifted as if alive.\n\n\n\nThe finish line grew closer, a beacon of light in the abyssal darkness. Marcus's pulse raced in time with the rhythmic throb of his tires. The final stretch was a blur of carnage and chaos. The monstrous racers gave one last desperate push, but Marcus's focus was unbreakable.\n\n\n\nAs he crossed the line, the world around him seemed to explode in a shower of crimson pixels. The screen went black for a heart-stopping moment before the words 'YOU HAVE UNLOCKED THE SECRET' flashed in blood-red letters. The game's music, once a catchy tune, morphed into a cacophony of screams and metallic clanging.\n\n\n\nThe tension in the room snapped, and Marcus found himself standing, his breaths coming in ragged gasps. Jake, who had been watching with bated breath, leaned back on the couch, his expression a mix of awe and horror. \"You did it,\" he murmured.\n\n\n\nMarcus turned to face his friend, his eyes wide with a mix of triumph and terror. \"What happens now?\" he managed to ask, his voice shaking.\n\n\n\nJake's grin returned, but it was no longer filled with excitement. It was the grin of someone who knew a secret that was too terrible to share. \"Now,\" he said slowly, \"you're part of the legend.\"\n\n\n\nThe room grew colder still, and the game's menu transformed into a twisted version of itself. The words 'BLOOD ROAD' continued to pulse, but now they were accompanied by the image of the Crash Bandicoot costume, the eyes now burning with a fiery rage that seemed to bore into Marcus's soul.\n\n\n\nHe looked back at the TV, his hand hovering over the reset button. He knew he should turn it off, walk away from the game, but an irresistible curiosity gnawed at him. What had he unlocked? What was waiting for him in this nightmarish realm?\n\n\n\nWith trembling fingers, Marcus selected 'Continue'. The screen faded to black, and the only sound was the frantic beating of his heart. When the game resumed, the track was no longer a track at all. It was a path through hell itself, lined with the tortured souls of those who had come before him.\n\n\n\nThe kart felt heavier, as if it were made of lead. The controls were sluggish, unresponsive to his commands. The air grew thick with the scent of burning rubber and sulfur. Marcus gritted his teeth, determined to conquer this new challenge, to uncover the secret that lay beyond the horrors of Blood Road.\n\n\n\nThe race continued, each lap more terrifying than the last. The other drivers had become demons, their carts transformed into chariots of the damned. The once-fun power-ups were now weapons of torment, and the track itself was alive, twisting and writhing like a serpent seeking to devour him whole.\n\n\n\nMarcus could feel his sanity slipping, his mind straining under the weight of the game's malevolent influence. Each lap brought him closer to the truth, but the cost was becoming unbearable. The once-joyous anthems of victory were now drowned out by the wails of the tormented, echoing through the speakers like a siren's call to madness.\n\n\n\nIn a moment of lucidity, Marcus realized that the prize wasn't something he wanted to claim. It was something that claimed him. The game had a life of its own, feeding off his fear and determination, growing more powerful with every lap he completed. He needed to stop playing, but his hands moved with a will that seemed separate from his own, steering him towards the final stretch.\n\n\n\nAs the game's clock counted down to the last second, Marcus saw the finish line distort into a gaping maw, ready to consume him. His heart thundered in his chest, his palms slick with cold sweat. He had to win, not for the reward, but to escape the nightmare.\n\n\n\nWith a final burst of speed, he hurtled across the line, and the world around him shuddered. The room grew darker, the shadows thickening into a tangible substance that clung to his skin. The TV's screen cracked, the image of the game morphing into a swirling vortex of crimson and black. The console's lights flickered erratically, and the air grew colder still.\n\n\n\nThe game's final message, 'YOU HAVE CONQUERED THE ROAD OF THE DAMNED', screamed at him in a font that bled into the screen. And with it came the sound of laughter, deep and malicious, resonating from somewhere beyond the confines of the dorm room. It was the laughter of the strange man in the costume, the creator of this twisted game.\n\n\n\nMarcus's eyes darted to the door, expecting the costumed figure to appear in the flesh. Instead, the room remained empty, save for the cackling echoes of his twisted victory. His mind raced, trying to comprehend what he'd just unleashed. Had he truly won, or had he merely played into the game's sinister design?\n\n\n\nThe costume was still there, watching him from the corner of the room. Its eyes glowed with the same malevolence as the game's. Marcus took a step back, his hand inching towards the power outlet. He had to end this, had to cut off the game's lifeblood.\n\n\n\nWith a trembling hand, he reached for the plug, his heart racing in his ears. The costume's eyes grew wider, the laughter from the TV swelling into a crescendo. As his finger touched the plastic, a jolt of pain shot through his body, and the world around him began to warp. The floor buckled, the walls stretched, and the room grew darker still.\n\n\n\nThe costume lurched forward, reaching for him with outstretched arms, the gloved hands tipped with razor-sharp claws. Marcus stumbled back, dropping the controller, his body screaming at him to run. But he knew that escape was no longer an option.\n\n\n\nThe game had claimed him, and now he was part of its twisted narrative. The costume grew larger, its form stretching and distorting until it filled the room. The laughter grew louder, the darkness absolute. And as the game world consumed him, Marcus could only think of the fateful day he'd decided to play Crash Team Racing.\n\n\n\nThe irony was not lost on him; what had started as a nostalgic trip down memory lane had become a descent into a hell of his own making. The room disappeared, and he was left with nothing but the cold embrace of the shadowy world of 'Blood Road'.\n\n\n\nMarcus screamed, the sound swallowed by the void. The costume loomed over him, a grinning demon, ready to claim its prize. And as the game reset, ready for the next unsuspecting player, the echo of the maniacal laughter lingered in the air, a chilling reminder of the curse he'd unleashed.\n\n\n\nThe room grew lighter, and the costume retreated to its corner, watching him with those unblinking eyes. Marcus knew he was trapped, forever bound to the whims of the game, a plaything for the twisted mind that had created it. And so he waited, in the cold, silent dorm room, for the next player to find the cursed game and take up the challenge.\n\n\n\nDays turned into weeks, and the game remained dormant, the costume a constant, eerie presence. Marcus's friends grew concerned, but he couldn't bring himself to tell them the truth. He was afraid of what they would think, what they might do. The game had changed him in some fundamental way, and he didn't know if he could ever go back to who he was before.\n\n\n\nOne night, unable to bear the solitude any longer, Marcus decided to confront his fate. He sat down in front of the TV, the game still sitting in the console, the screen a flickering testament to his folly. He picked up the controller, the weight of it feeling heavier than ever before.\n\n\n\nWith a deep breath, he booted up the game once more. The familiar jingle played, but it was tainted now, a macabre lullaby that sent chills down his spine. The costume stirred in the corner, the eyes burning brighter with anticipation. Marcus's hand hovered over the 'Select' button, his heart racing like it was about to burst from his chest.\n\n\n\nThe game's main menu stared back at him, mocking his fear with its innocent, pixelated charm. But he knew the horrors that lay beneath the surface, waiting for the next victim. He took a step back, the controller slipping from his hand and clattering to the floor. He couldn't do this again. He had to find a way to end it.\n\n\n\nHe turned to Jake, who had been watching from the doorway, his eyes wide with a mix of dread and fascination. \"You have to help me,\" Marcus begged. \"We have to destroy this thing before it gets someone else.\"\n\n\n\nJake swallowed hard, his hand shaking as he picked up the game. \"But... the reward,\" he stammered.\n\n\n\n\"Forget the reward,\" Marcus snapped. \"There's no prize worth this. Just help me, please.\"\n\n\n\nTogether, they carried the game and console to the dumpster outside, the costume's laughter echoing in their ears with every step. As they tossed it in, the disc glinted in the moonlight, a silent promise that it wasn't over.\n\n\n\nBack in the room, they sat in silence, the weight of what they had done hanging heavy in the air. Marcus knew that the game was still out there, waiting. And he knew that one day, someone else would find it, someone who hadn't heard the whispers of its dark history.\n\n\n\nBut for now, he had bought himself some time. Time to figure out what had happened to him, and how he could ever escape the shadow of 'Blood Road'. Time to live with the knowledge that he was now a part of the very legend he had once scoffed at.\n\n\n\nAs the night grew darker, Marcus couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. The costume's eyes haunted his dreams, the laughter a constant backdrop to his waking moments. The game had left its mark on him, a stain that no amount of time or distance could ever erase.\n\n\n\nAnd somewhere, deep within the bowels of the digital abyss, the maniacal creator of 'Blood Road' waited, eager for the next unsuspecting soul to take the wheel and enter his twisted world. The game was never truly over, it had only just begun."},"38":{"title":"Spread the chaos.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kgcve7\/spread_the_chaos\/","flair":"Very Short Story","author":"TheHappyTruth","selftext":"They keep things hidden.

Just a simple note file titled “MindCheck.” My therapist recommended it to track memory slips and mood swings. I’ve been having more foggy moments lately—walking into a room and forgetting why, losing track of time, that kind of thing.\n\nAt first, the entries were harmless.\n\nMarch 29 – Slept six hours. Vivid dream about a hallway with no doors. Fed the cat. Forgot to eat breakfast.\n\nApril 1 – Walked into the kitchen, forgot why. Still tired. Felt like someone said my name but no one was there.\n\nNothing unusual. But then came April 2:\n\nWho moved the hallway chair? It’s facing the wall. Pretty sure I didn’t do that.\n\nI stopped. I didn’t remember writing that. And I definitely didn’t move the chair. I got up to check—it was facing the wall. Just sitting there, like someone had turned it to watch the blank paint.\n\nI live alone.\n\nI brushed it off. Maybe I was half-asleep. Maybe I bumped it.\n\nThen came April 3:\n\nThe man in the kitchen isn’t real. Repeat until it’s true.\n\nThat one made my chest tighten. I don’t talk like that. I don’t write like that. It was timestamped at 3:12 a.m.\n\nI checked my phone’s activity logs. I hadn’t used it at that time. I even reviewed my home security footage—everything looked normal... except for one skipped frame around 3:12. Just a single flicker of static. Then back to normal.\n\nApril 4:\n\nYou’re doing good. You’re almost ready to remember.\n\nThat entry felt wrong. Like it was trying to reassure me—but not for me. More like it was monitoring me.

But when I opened the note app yesterday, everything was different.\n\nThe file wasn’t called “MindCheck” anymore.\n\nIt had been renamed:\n\n“Reintegration Logs.”\n\nAll my entries had been rewritten. Every single one. They now started with:\n\nSUBJECT 42-B — Integration Progress: Day 3\nFalse self still in control.

For one year and three months, I worked with a small band of fellow strays and desperate personalities who knew how to clean up and shut up. This was all in the distant past, north of a decade even. In all that time, I’ve never breathed a word of these stories to anyone. Not my wife, not my friends, not even my shrink. There was a time I prided myself on that, but now? I’m old. Old in a way much different from age. My head hasn’t sprouted so much as a single grey hair, and yet I’ve seen so much. I can’t carry it forever. What better place to put this than here? No one believes the stories on this site anyway.\n\nIt’s hard to say the time spent working with the bastards was pleasant. It wasn't often we’d come home without looking a little more tired than the previous day. That being said, the memories I have are warm and coated in nostalgia. Thinking back is sometimes like biting into warm bread fresh from the oven. If I remember more clearly, I feel that bread hit an exposed nerve in a rotten tooth. I don’t think any of us were bad people. We all just needed money.\n\nIt wasn’t a job with a loyal staff. I was one of five workers who stayed longer than a year. The oldest was… well, we’ll call him Lonny. Lonny started the company years before I joined, and you could see every year on him. He was a short, old man who spoke under a mountain of gravel and barely ever above a whisper. Despite his quiet and strained voice, he loved to talk. We’d hear story after story about completely elaborate and fabricated scenarios he made up on the spot. Why? Beats me, probably thought it was funny. Lonny, with enough motivation and time, could convince you that the sky was green and dogs walked on two legs. I once watched him completely convince a newbie that SPAM came from an animal native to Hawaii who was being hunted to extinction due to overproduction of the food. Everything he said was buried under five layers of irony and 2 layers of sarcasm. The one thing he swore was true, put it on the grave of his mother, was that he met Quinton Tarantino and was the inspiration for The Wolf in Pulp Fiction.\n\nDo I believe him? Fuck no.\n\nThere were other regulars. Jackson who was on someones shitlist and needed to make money fast. Sandra, who couldn’t have been more than nineteen when she started with Lonny and was even younger when she saw her first body. \nAnd Frank.\n\nI see them all as clearly as the day I left them. Some of their faces make me smile while some make vomit climb my throat. However, all of us, like it or not, are bonded by our shared story.\n\nThat story started the day I lost my job. Before doing the shady side of the trade, I was a real crime scene cleaner. Worked with a very respected company for several years before my greed got the better of me. It’s not a very interesting or poetic story. You’re cleaning out a suicide and see a man’s life savings under his mattress. More money than you’d make scrubbing up brains in a decade. I made a decision, I think most people would. Where’d it get me? Across the desk from my boss, my contract sat between us like a thread keeping me from plummeting.\n\nI have no ill will for the guy. In all honesty, there wasn’t much he could do given the position I put him in. He sat there for a while, turning the contract on his desk like a top. I don’t remember the entire conversation, but I remember the first words we both said.\n\n“I’m fired, right?”\n\n“Shit! You psychic?”\n\nThe conversation almost seemed scripted after that. Lots of “nothing I can do”s and “we wish you the best in the future”s. I knew all of this already, and knew nothing I could say would change his mind. Did that stop me from begging? No. I think I was actually in tears as I asked him for anything, anything to avoid unemployment. I was in a bad spot financially. We all were. He knew it, and whether out of pity or vengeance, he reached into his desk and handed me a card. Moretti Appliance Repair, followed by a phone number. My boss told me that was all he could do for me and ripped my contract in half. Later that same day, I had my first meeting with Alonzo Moretti.\n\n“Did you know that pieces of the Ark of the Covenant still exist in the deserts between Egypt and Israel? Yeah, when Moses led his people through the wilderness, they carried the Ark through sandstorm and thicket. Tiny pieces of gold were scraped away as they walked. If you’re a religious man, you’d know touching the Ark was enough to receive divine retribution. These specks, that still wander the winds of the desert, carry the same power. For thousands of years, people have dropped dead in the region for unexplained reasons. The one common thread? It was always a windy day.”\n\nThat was the first thing Lonny ever said to me as I sat in his broom closet\/office. He stared at me, lit cigarette in hand as he waited for my response. How the fuck do you respond to that? Mind you, the only thing I had said to him up till this point was, “Hello, sir, nice to meet you.”\n\nI shuffled in my seat awkwardly, “Yeah… Egypt’s weird, huh?”\n\nHis face fell a bit. He seemed disappointed. After that, his tone became more serious. He said my previous boss spoke highly of me but said I was a man of corruptible conscience. I moved to disagree before Lonny explained that was exactly why he agreed to meet me. He was going to ask me to do the same work I've been doing, but for five times the pay. All I had to do was keep my mouth shut and my eyes down while I worked. That simple.\n\nDespite my track record, I wasn’t a moron. I knew exactly what he was implying. He wanted me to clean up scenes before they became crime scenes. I asked him why he was being so up front about all this.\n\n“You’ve worked for the official boys for… let’s see… 8 months. You know the trade, the techniques, the equipment. Hell, half the new guys will believe pasta soaks up blood better than a sponge. You’re already a godsend in that department. Plus, I saw it in you. You are, in fact, a man of corruptible conscience. I could reach into my jacket, toss you a stack of bills, and you’d never breathe a word of this to anyone ever. That, I’d put on my mother’s grave.”\n\nI didn’t argue. I started the next day.\n\nMy first day, like almost every day, started early. A group of seven guys packed into two vans before the birds had even begun to sing the sun’s rise. We stopped at a nearby laundry service to buy cleaning supplies second-hand. We never bought directly from stores, as an appliance repair company, buying so many chemicals would raise a few eyebrows if anyone were to look into the business. As for the laundry owners, we paid double, and they didn’t ask questions.\n\nAs the small town’s aging buildings gave way to seas of trees, I got to know the guys I was riding with. Lonny rode shotgun, he insisted that I and another newbie listen to his protocol before we got there. The driver was Sandra, whom I never heard speak until two months on the job. The other newbie was at my side and behind me was Jackson who also kept to himself but to a less religious degree than Sandra.\n\nThe atmosphere in that van was grey. The scenery outside was covered in a silver film from the half-frozen dew on the grass and the fog that sought refuge in the lower valleys. Sometimes, when I wake up early enough to watch the sunrise, I feel like I’m back in that van, hearing Lonny give me the crash course in body vanishing.\n\nOur process required one thing of the client. They had to have a large appliance in the house that they wanted cleaned. Think a refrigerator, washing machine, oven, dishwasher. Anything vaguely human-sized. Lonny and his crew would come in and clean the place, the ‘package’ as he called them, would be stuffed into the appliance along with any waste produced while cleaning. The appliance was then transferred to the van, where we’d then drive to Lonny’s workshed at the edge of town to properly dispose of the remains using a makeshift crematory. The ashes and bone fragments would then be scattered in Lonny’s pond with fish food to erase all evidence. A week later, after the appliance had been properly cleaned, Lonny would take it back to the client, which marked the end of the job.\n\nThis system, throughout the entire time I worked with Lonny, only failed twice, and not due to him at all. In many ways, the man was a genius, but others likely consider him a maniac. I think he’s just like any other blue-collar worker. \nMy first day was a two-for-one. Lonny told me we’d be doing jobs at our most loyal customer’s home, and a brand new client who ordered a rush job. The rush job was scheduled later in the day, so we were hitting other first. I remember hearing Jackson squirm behind me.\n\nWhen we arrived at the property, we were greeted at the front gate by a large, jolly man who could have been mistaken for Santa Claus if he had worn the right color. We’ll refer to him as Santa, and first impressions proved him to be an extremely likable individual. I caught myself laughing at a few of his jokes as he shook hands and told Lonny a few fishing stories. However, I never let my guard down too much, considering why we were here.\n\nHis kitchen is where the package sat. Santa was well aware of Lonny’s process and wanted to make access to the fridge as easy as possible. This, plus the plastic sheets covering the walls and floor, was the sign of courtesy that regulars to Lonny’s business often showed. A courtesy juxtaposed by the grizzly scene.\n\nOur package was naked and tied to a rickety wooden chair. There were very few parts of him that retained his skin tone. The large majority of his body was marred by purple and red. That, and the small bit of white visible from his exposed cranium. I could tell just by looking at the man that his death was as long as it was brutal. Protruding ribs and a shrunken face suggested malnourishment. He had been kept here a long while. In that time, it seemed each of his nerves became acutely familiar with pain in all its forms. The killing blow rested on his left temple, where the concave skull had caused one eye to pop while the other bulged unnaturally.\n\nThe other newbie at my side puked and ran out the door. Lonny just laughed, “It’s amazing how many people lie on their resumes. Frank, get him a beer and talk him through it.”\n\nThe skinny, balding man in the corner nodded. His youthful face took one final look at the body before silently walking away.\n\nSanta hovered over us as we wondered at his work. He leaned over Jackson’s shoulder and whispered, “I hope you’re saving every penny he pays you. Would hate to ruin Lonny and I’s camaraderie.” \n\nJackson didn’t respond, just started cleaning. I did the same.\n\nThe job was easy enough, thanks to Santa’s preparations. In less than 30 minutes, we had the fridge dollied to the van as Santa stacked hundreds into Lonny’s palm. I didn’t see the other newbie when I left. Only Frank. I didn’t question it.\n\nThe ride back was much more uncomfortable. I had switched vans with another worker who had started a little before me. This put me alone with Frank and a fridge holding our package. The air was tense, even worse than the funeral-like silence of the other van. The silence in this one was heavier somehow. The quiet was only ever interrupted when we hit a bump, and the resulting heavy thud inside the fridge betrayed its contents. At least the other van had Lonny there to shoot the shit and drop tips. Frank though? Frank was different. He was silent, but he didn’t ignore you. Even with his eyes on the road, you felt watched. Like I was giggling in church.\n\nSo, I, in my infinite wisdom, decided to talk to the man. Don’t ask me why. I never did. When my voice came, it cracked on the first syllable, “That guy back there… he does that a lot?”\n\nI remember he smiled, if it was at my statement or my shaken state, I still don’t know, “Everyone has their thing.”\n\nHis voice was smoother than I expected. The kind of cadence you’d hear in a courtroom. Somehow, in that single sentence, I recognized an education in his past, “Why?”\n\n“Not our job to ask why. We’re hired to keep the dead quiet. People said a hundred years ago that ‘dead men tell no tales’. In our day and age, that’s becoming a crock of shit. You put any dead man in front of modern-day labs and cops, and they will tell stories like you wouldn’t believe. Dead men speak through the living. Last thing we should ever do is talk about them or our clients.”\n\nNo more words were exchanged.\n\nWe stopped at Lonny’s workshed to drop off the package. From here, the group split. Lonny and I took the van to the next job while the others covered disposal for the Santa job. I drove as the memory of Frank’s cathedral-like car faded to Lonny’s cheerful tale weaving. He explained there’d be days we were stretched thin, and I’d be forced to solo a job. He wanted me to be ready for it now, so I wasn’t blindsided in the future. This led us to discuss his history with the company and the interesting jobs he’d seen. Something he mentioned caught my attention.\n\n“Yeah, shit, if Frank hadn’t helped me through it I’d have been in prison before you were in diapers.”\n\n“Frank? I thought you started the company.”\n\n“I did, but Frank?” He lit a cigarette as he thought for a moment, “Hell, he’s been doing this since 97… Or was it 87? Hell if I know, man’s got a history.”\n\nThe conversation died as we arrived at the jobsite. The dingy motel was at its most quiet.\n\nThis scene was different from the last. A double package with only one dishwasher to make it fit. Lonny sat in the car while the client walked me to the room and opened the door. I tasted pennies before even seeing the room. Blood covered the sheets and soaked the carpets surrounding the two packages who were still locked in a tight embrace. His hands around her throat, and the skin of his throat under her nails.\n\n“Bitch always panicked, was more trouble than she earned,” the client said, “You got 2 hours till this place is popping again. Cops sometimes snoop around then.”\n\nI nodded and he left me to the job.\n\nMy original plan was to move both packages to the tiled bathroom to limit the blood that leaked into the carpet. I say original because as I tried to lift the john, the blood made his body slip and fall back onto the woman, who grunted in pain.\nI stopped in my tracks. Looked down at the woman again. She wasn’t moving, a glassy look in her eye. I leaned closer, never looking away.\n\nAfter a minute, she finally blinked.\n\nI gasped and jumped back, which made her rise in turn and lift her arms in protest.\n\n“You’re fucking alive?”\n\nShe shushed me and looked at the door. After a few seconds, she turned back and whispered, “He’ll kill me… You have to get me out of here…”\nMy eyes shifted to the dead john behind her. She read my expression, “He would have killed me. I didn’t have a choice. Please, you have to get me out of here.”\n\nI hesitated. Then decided.\n\nThe cleanup took significantly longer than Santa’s. The lack of preparations and carpeted floor made cleaning a headache. Luckily, the client had provided a few rolls of the matching material, meaning I could cut out the stained flooring and replace it. The dishwasher was loaded into the van at the hour and twenty mark just as the motel’s female workforce began roaming. The client watched while counting out the cash.\n\n“Impressive as hell, I’ll call you back if need be.”\nI just nodded.\n\n“Oh, and that dishwasher is really broken. Do you actually do repair or…?”\n\n“Yeah, for an additional fee.”\n\nThe client smiled and added a few more bills, “Commerce.”\n\nLonny was oddly quiet on the drive back. Fine by me, because I had no idea how to not sound suspicious about the very much alive prostitute in the dishwasher. I went twenty over the speed limit trying to get to the shed as fast as possible. When I arrived, the sun was setting on the horizon.\nI told Lonny I could handle the disposal myself and moved the dishwasher into the workshed. The smell of that place was unlike anything I can describe, burning hair mixed with burst stomachs and charred meat. I can still smell it when I grill steak. Still, it was probably a hell of a lot better for the girl when I opened the dishwasher and let her crawl free.\n\n“Sorry, about having to be in there with… you know…”\n\n“That’s fine. It was better than when he was breathing.”\n\nWe talked a bit as I loaded the waste into the furnace. It was a story not unique to her, but one I don’t wish to repeat. She chose to tell me, I can’t choose to tell you on her behalf. All you need to know is that she had nowhere to go.\n\nI did what anyone would. I was paid for two bodies but only destroyed one. She deserved the right to her price point, so I gave her the money and told her to wait before leaving. My last words to her were, “See you around.”\n\n“No offense, but given your line of work, I hope that’s not true.”\n\nI left her in the shed and joined Lonny at the pier, where he was tossing dust into the pond. I nodded to him, he nodded back.\n\n“You finish up?”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n“What’d you do about the girl?”\n\nI froze solid, causing him to laugh, “Walls of that shed are paper thin, I heard you talking with her. Gave you two some privacy. What’d you do with her?\n\nWeight lifted off my shoulders as I realized Lonny didn’t care, “Gave her some cash, told her to start over.”\n\n“The right thing. Not what I would have done, but the right thing.”\n\nSilence passed over us for a few moments.\n\n“You know,” Lonny said as he scratched the back of his head, “When I started this line of work, I saw the person on every job site. It was hard not to feel bad when scrubbing up the brains of Bad Luck Barry. Or closing the oven door on Runaway Rose. I genuinely felt for each and every one. It started small. I saw the more mangled corpses as a long workday. I saw the freshies with voided bowls as a nuisance. This job took and took till I started to see new loudmouths on the street as future packages. Kid, we’re all just meat. Sometimes I’m so terrified of how I’ve changed that I think it’ll scare me straight. Make me get a real job. But it doesn’t matter if I’m here, or at McDonald’s, or in a fucking classroom. I’ll still be in the meat business.”\n\nHe dumped the rest of his bucket into the pond. “This just pays more.”\n\n“Why are you telling me this?”\n\n“Cus you’re a good kid. I don’t want you to be like me. Go home, think it over before you come back.”\n\nWith that, he turned and walked to the van, leaving me with the fish and starlight.\n"},"43":{"title":"4% ABV, 100% Orangutan by Nicholas Leonard","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kg761u\/4_abv_100_orangutan_by_nicholas_leonard\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"poetnicholasleonard","selftext":"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/10odJU-OAd8VH9ByefPuL6LN8JWSgIimNNcv2GX0fpLQ\/edit?usp=drivesdk\n\nWrote this this morning "},"44":{"title":"The Room That Wasn't There","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kg1iys\/the_room_that_wasnt_there\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Uglopi_2000","selftext":"\nIt started with a noise—a low, wet scraping, like flesh dragging against wood.\n\nI lived alone in a creaky, ancient apartment building in a forgotten corner of the city. The kind of place with thin walls and stories no one tells out loud. I’d been there six months, and until that night, nothing unusual had happened.\n\nThen I noticed a door in the hallway.\nA door that wasn't there before.\n\nIt was between my bedroom and bathroom, squeezed into a space too narrow for anything but wall. The door was pale, bloated, almost pulsing. It had no knob—just a slit where the wood looked torn, or chewed.\n\nI touched it.\nIt exhaled.\n\nInside was pitch black. But not the ordinary dark—it drank the light. I held my phone flashlight up, but the beam stopped an inch past the threshold like the shadows bit into it.\n\nThen the voices started. Not speech—mimicry. My mother’s voice, though she’d been dead for years. My own voice, laughing. Then crying. Then screaming.\n\nI should have closed the door.\nI went in instead.\n\nThe air was thick. Not musty, not stale—organic. Like lungs full of tar. I walked forward, but the space stretched—forever, sideways, spiraling. The walls pulsed like meat. Something watched. Not from in front of me—but inside me.\n\nThen I saw it.\n\nNot a creature—a shape, born from memories I'd forgotten. My childhood dog with no eyes, hanging from a ceiling hook. My third-grade teacher, her jaw unhinged, whispering answers I never asked. My own face, sewn to a mannequin, twitching in silence.\n\nThey moved like puppets without strings. And they knew me. Called me by my thoughts. Showed me things I'd buried: a time I let a boy drown. The kitten I crushed under my bike tire when I was six. The lie that killed my sister.\n\nThey laughed. Not with joy—with familiarity.\n\nI tried to run but had no legs. I tried to scream but had no mouth. The room swallowed identity like breath underwater. It did not want me dead. It wanted me unmade.\n\nThen came the mirror.\n\nIt stood on rotting legs, its surface smeared with handprints on the inside. I looked—and I saw not myself, but what I would become: a husk, repeating every lie I’d ever told, forever. Trapped in a loop of guilt and horror. A puppet whose strings were regret.\n\nThat was the punishment.\nIt wasn’t a room. It was a confession box built by a god who only believed in punishment.\n\nI don’t remember leaving.

In vacant homes across continents, robot vacuums now enter impossible hallways—three to four meters in length—and see their batteries collapse from a normal several-hour endurance to **total depletion in under 20 minutes**. When the charge dies, devices dutifully return to the nearest familiar room, powerless and awaiting manual rescue. Crucially, these corridors still appear **only** when homes are empty; supervised runs yield flawless, corridor-free maps.\n\n---\n\n## Case Report 1: The Lee Enigma (Seattle, WA)\n\nHigh above the lapping waters of Elliott Bay, **Dr. Marcus Lee** initiated his robot vacuum with a casual expectation of a routine clean. Wanting to test an overnight cycle, he left his modern condo—bathed in moonlight through its glass walls and sparse, polished-concrete floors—and monitored the vacuum’s official app remotely from his university lab. To his surprise, he saw the vacuum pause partway through its route, and the app displayed the presence of a 3.2 m corridor that should not exist—cutting straight through his rug and shelving area. Moments after entering this mapped corridor, the battery bar began to plummet, dropping from 100% to zero in **19 minutes** despite minimal real-world distance covered.\n\nShaken by the unexpected drain, Dr. Lee resolved to investigate. He borrowed a thermal camera and an EM-field meter from his university lab and learned to export LiDAR point-cloud data from the vacuum’s developer settings. Over the next week, while away at the lab, he watched remotely as each session began normally but then paused at exactly 2:03 AM, the map showing a 3.2 m corridor slicing through his rug and display shelves.\n\nMore unsettling was the camera feed: every time the vacuum approached a solid wall at the corridor’s supposed entrance, the live image would freeze for one second. One moment, the vacuum faced an unremarkable concrete panel; after the glitch, the feed resumed, revealing only an empty floor—no vacuum in sight. It was only by checking the vacuum app that he realized the device had “vanished” into that phantom passage.\n\n“Watching the battery percentage drop like that felt like watching time slip away,” Dr. Lee admits. He experimented with room conditions—dimming lights, varying temperature—but nothing deterred the corridor’s appearance or the rapid drain. Conventional sensors reported nothing abnormal, leaving him to wonder if he was witnessing a breach in what he considers immutable physical laws.\n\nNotably, when Dr. Lee initiates a cleaning cycle in person during the day, the corridor never manifests, and the vacuum completes its full run uninterrupted.\n\n---\n\n## Case Report 2: The Müller Extraction (Munich, Germany)\n\nWithin the warm wood-paneled halls of her 19th-century townhouse, **Mrs. Ingrid Müller** could hardly believe the readings on her phone. From her neighbor’s kitchen, she monitored the vacuum’s companion app, which normally displayed remaining runtime. On the night of her bridge club, she watched the app’s estimate tumble from 120 minutes to zero in **17 minutes**, all while the map traced a corridor behind her ornate oak console.\n\nDisturbed, Mrs. Müller turned to her porch security camera, pointed at the hallway doorway. As observers on her phone, she and a concerned friend saw the feed lock for one second at the moment of entry. A single frozen frame captures the vacuum against the closed door; when the image returns, the hallway is empty—and the vacuum is gone. Only the companion app’s location indicator implied it was now beyond that threshold.\n\nFrightened whispers in her bridge group invoked restless spirits or mischievous poltergeists. She tried lighting candles and soft hymns played from her phone, but each ritual ended with the same corridor map and rapid battery drain.\n\nMoreover, any daytime cleaning session she starts while at home shows no corridor, further affirming that the anomaly only emerges in solitude. In daylight, she found no sign: walls looked solid, and no hidden passage greeted her inspection. Night remains a time of dread, as the hush of her lonely home seems to carry echoes of that unseen hallway.\n\n---\n\n## Case Report 3: The Alvarez Revelation (Brooklyn, NY)\n\nIn her bright Prospect Park loft—lined with canvases and art supplies—**Ms. Sofia Alvarez** led a double life between daylight painting and nocturnal investigation. After rearranging a wall of custom bookshelves, she expected a fresh breeze of creativity. Instead, at 2:17 AM each night, her vacuum charted a 3.5 m corridor there and drained its 3-hour battery in **18–20 minutes**.\n\nArmed only with a basic ambient light logger, a temperature\/humidity sensor, and a motion-activated Wi‑Fi camera, all synced to smartphone apps, she left home to observe remotely. Though her Edison bulbs never flickered and temperature readings held steady, the camera feed froze for precisely one second as the vacuum met the bookshelf wall. One frame shows it poised in front of solid wood; when video resumed, it had disappeared from view. Only by refreshing her vacuum app did she learn it had moved beyond that point—though nothing physical could confirm its passage.\n\nThe next morning, she measured the gap: a mere 1.8 m of solid barrier stood where the maps insisted there was a hallway. Online, she found dozens of similar accounts—artists in Berlin, homeowners in São Paulo—each reporting the same digital mirage. Though friends joke about her “Artistic Aberration Project,” Ms. Alvarez feels the uncanny pulse of something vast and unexplained humming beneath her studio’s quiet floors.\n\nConversely, any cleaning run she initiates while present in her loft not only avoids the phantom corridor but completes successfully, underscoring the emptiness requirement.\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Findings\n\n* **Rapid Energy Drain:** Vacuums lose full charge within **16–20 minutes** when mapping phantom corridors.\n* **Consistent Geometry:** Corridor blueprints remain identical across multiple runs and locations.\n* **Camera Freeze Glitch:** Remote camera feeds freeze for one second at the moment of entry, then resume showing empty space; only the vacuum’s app reveals its shifted position.\n* **Consumer Sensor Silence:** Thermal and EM-field meters, light\/temperature loggers, and basic motion detectors all register baseline readings.\n* **Presence Override:** Corridors manifest exclusively when no humans are present; supervised runs remain anomaly-free.\n\n---\n\n## Discussion and Theoretical Perspectives\n\n### 1. Firmware and SLAM Algorithm Fault:\nThe most straightforward explanation involves errors in SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithms. These systems fuse data from lasers, optical sensors, and odometry to generate maps. In rare cases, reflective floors or repetitive patterns can trick LiDAR into layering false walls. Yet the hallmark of mapping errors is inconsistency. Here, corridors are **identical** across different vacuum brands and firmware versions—improbable for a mere software glitch.\n\n### 2. Interdimensional Spatial Breach Hypothesis:\nParanormal researchers argue that what vacuums perceive as corridors are fleeting portals to adjacent dimensions. LIDAR pulses, traveling at the speed of light, might reflect off unseen surfaces in another realm. The one-second camera freeze could represent a temporal misalignment as data packets shift frequency bands. Standard sensors—detecting heat, EM fields, and sound—register silence because they remain bound to our reality. While sensational, this theory aligns with the unwavering mapping precision and total sensor blackout.\n\n### 3. Environmental Resonance Model:\nA fringe group of geophysicists studies how structural materials—reinforced concrete and metal conduits—could harbor acoustic or electromagnetic standing waves. If these waves coincide with LiDAR frequencies, they might create optical illusions for the vacuum’s scanners, while simultaneously inducing drag on its power circuits through eddy currents or microvibrations. Still, no documented resonance exhibits the spatial accuracy or the synchronized camera inertial delay noted in every case.\n\n### 4. Observer-Effect Suppression Theory:\nDrawing inspiration from quantum mechanics, this approach posits that the corridors only emerge when not observed by conscious beings. In essence, human presence collapses the phenomenon, preventing it from manifesting. Critics dismiss this as metaphysical overreach, but the pattern is undeniable: corridors vanish under direct human supervision yet return once the last door closes.\n\n---\n\n## Official Acknowledgment\n\nWhile no official statements have been released, internal sources suggest that several governmental bodies—including the US Department of Energy, Germany’s Federal Office for Notifiable Occurrences, and Japan’s Ministry of Internal Affairs—have taken interest in the anomaly. According to an anonymous contact within one of the vacuum manufacturing companies, these agencies have quietly requested that manufacturers retain and, when necessary, make mapping and firmware data accessible to authorities. The source also indicated that governments may be deliberately avoiding public disclosure, potentially fearing unnecessary panic or mass concern about the nature and implications of these unexplained events.\n\n---\n\n## Reporter’s Note\n\nThese silent corridors disrupt the boundary between everyday technology and the unexplored. A firmware bug remains a justifiable hypothesis, but the precise geometry, rapid energy depletion, and camera-freeze glitch urge us to consider bolder possibilities—environmental feedback loops or even a brush with the paraphysical. As investigators and homeowners continue to chart these invisible halls, one thing is clear: our most trusted domestic devices may steer us toward realms unseen, one lost charge at a time."},"48":{"title":"A small little thing (Original Creepypasta Story)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kg1e9s\/a_small_little_thing_original_creepypasta_story\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Fun-Ad7903","selftext":"In the quiet town of Münster, a poem was discovered in an old house:\n\nA small little thing,\n\nWhat did you bring?\n\nSomeone to hold?\n\nSomeone who isn‘t cold?\n\n„No!

A brass dial, a humming coil, a switch that glowed faintly blue. He had called it The Gentle Hour. The first time he used it, he wept. He stood in his boyhood home and watched his mother sing.

Another blink, and he saw the moment he first opened his shop.\n\nBut something went wrong.\n\nHe can’t remember the moment of the explosion—only the deafening ring, the smell of scorched copper, and a flash of white.

Specifically, takeoff and landing. That roller coaster feeling when the engines roar to full speed, pinning my body to the seat, saying Hail Marys under my breath until we finally leveled out. The landing was its own special nightmare with the wheels slamming down, that hollow, shuddering bounce that made you wonder if this was the time the whole thing came apart in a fireball. Once we were cruising, though, I could usually distract myself, a podcast, a movie, or tapping away at some mindless game on my phone until we touched back down.\n\nOnce connected to the in-flight Wi-Fi, I opened the airline’s movie catalog, scrolling for something to download. Marvel movies were my go-to for flights; bright, stupid, easy to follow. Perfect for nerves. I flicked through the options and settled on the first Tobey Maguire Spider-Man, a familiar comfort. I tapped download, set the phone on the tray table in front of me, and leaned back to wait.\n\nWhen I checked it a few minutes later, a memory error popped up. Scowling, I flipped into settings. The trail cam app was hoarding almost half my phone's storage with hundreds of little clips, stretching back months. Mostly the usual: leaves shuddering in the wind, deer grazing along the tree line, squirrels scrambling up trees, the occasional stray dog. Nothing worth keeping.\n\nI lived on five acres carved out of the woods. Built the house myself, well, paid people to, right in a clearing just wide enough for a home and a backyard big enough for the kids to run around without tripping into the forest. I'd mounted trail cams everywhere I thought mattered, but it never felt like enough. There were blind spots everywhere. No matter how many cameras you bolted to trees, there were always more places to hide than to see.\n\nI started deleting videos absently, barely glancing at the thumbnails. Just clearing space. Not expecting anything. Maybe, if I was lucky, I’d catch a bear or something cool. Hell, maybe Bigfoot. Wouldn’t that be something.\n\nThen one thumbnail made me stop.\n\nThe timestamp was 3:14 AM, two nights ago. A figure, blurred and half-cropped by the frame, just off center. I tapped the clip open, curious.\n\nThe night vision grain danced across the screen. Trees swayed under a stiff wind, throwing long, twitchy shadows. And there, near the bottom of the frame, a man, standing perfectly still. Wearing a red plaid jacket, just like the one I kept by the front door. Same heavy boots. His face was hidden under the rim of a tree branch, a black void where his features should be. He didn’t move. Not an inch. Not even as the wind howled around him.\n\nMy mouth went dry. I looked closer, pressing the screen to try and coax out some detail, but it was too dark. I could feel the heat creeping up my neck, my heartbeat spiking. Was it me? Was it someone dressed exactly like me? Sleepwalking, maybe. That's what it had to be. My mind seized on the explanation like a drowning man grabbing a rope. I deleted the video quickly, hoping the action would somehow erase the feeling gnawing at my gut.\n\nFor a few minutes, it worked. My pulse slowed. I kept swiping through the old clips, trying not to look too closely at the thumbnails.\n\nUntil I saw another one.\n\nDifferent camera. Different angle. Different night, the night after the first sighting. The man again, or whatever he was, standing with his back to the camera, facing into the dark woods. I recognized the location immediately. The hiking trail that bordered the western edge of our property. The same red plaid jacket. The same worn boots.\n\nA cold sweat prickled down my back.\n\nHomeless guy, I told myself. Lost hiker. Coincidence.\n\nBut my hands shook as I deleted the second video.\n\nNow I wasn't just deleting. I was hunting. My fingers flicked through the clips faster, frantic. Deer. Squirrel. More deer. A flash of a mountain lion’s tail, disappearing into the brush. Squirrels again.\n\nFor two nights, nothing. No man. No figure. Just the usual background noise of the woods.\n\nI could feel my shoulders relaxing as I scrolled through more recent footage. Maybe it was over. Maybe whoever it was had moved on. Maybe it really had been nothing.\n\nThen I hit a clip from three nights ago.\n\nThe thumbnail was pure black, no movement, no detail. I tapped it open, frowning.\n\nThe camera caught a few seconds before the thumbnail: a man, me, walking straight toward the lens. He lifted a piece of cloth and draped it over the camera. Darkness swallowed the screen.\n\nMy stomach turned over.\n\nI exited the video and flicked through the others from that week. Same thing. Every camera near the house was blindfolded. Covered by cloth. Always the same figure doing it. Always me.\n\nI sat back hard in my seat, rubbing a hand over my mouth. Sleepwalking. That had to be it. God, it had to be. I laughed out loud, a dry, half-hysterical sound that made the woman two rows up twist in her seat to glance back at me. Sleepwalking. Jesus. What a story. I'd laugh about this for years. “It was me the whole time!” I’d joke at some future barbecue, raising my glass while everyone else howled.\n\nStill chuckling, I decided to keep those videos, they’d make a hell of a punchline, but I needed to finish clearing out the backlog. I tapped through, deleting the mundane clips by the dozens.\n\nWhen I finished, the app refreshed automatically. A new folder blinked at the top of the screen.\n\n**New Footage Uploaded.**\n\nI didn’t want to look.\n\nI looked anyway.\n\nA single new clip.\n\nTimestamped: 7 minutes ago.\n\nThe thumbnail was black.\n\nMy thumb hovered, then tapped.\n\nThe footage opened.\n\nOur house.\n\nThe wide clearing, dark under the trees.\n\nA shape, me, stepping into frame.\n\nI watched myself walk to the camera, cloth in hand, and reach out to cover the lens.\n\nThe screen went black.\n\n*Ding.*\n\n\"The captain has informed me that we will be landing in about fifteen minutes,\" the intercom crackled overhead. \"Please return your tray tables to the upright position and fasten your seatbelts to prepare for arrival.\"\n\nI sat frozen, my phone still glowing in my hand, the trail cam app waiting in the darkness for whatever came next."},"51":{"title":"Anyone remember that “Smiling Man” VHS tape on Channel 58?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kfhd7z\/anyone_remember_that_smiling_man_vhs_tape_on\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Brave-Treacle1073","selftext":"This has been stuck in my head for years and I’m finally posting to see if anyone else remembers this.\n\nBack around ‘93 or maybe early ‘94, I was at my cousin’s place in rural Ohio. we were up late just flipping through channels and landed on Channel 58, which I think was some kind of local access station.\n\nWhat came on was... weird.

Jimmy John, lanky as a scarecrow with a grin that could charm a snake, fixed bicycles for every kid in town.

College was a joke; I cheated my way to get ahead. I didn't even wanna be in school. I went so my parents wouldn't think I was a disappointment. My life was vomiting Everclear into Gage's toilet while he held my hair back, laughing through my hurling, 'Only pussies puke.' Three of us took turns snorting coke off Delta Phi Kappa tits. On occasion, spit-roasting a drunk Sigma Theta Rho pledge with Lewis in the back of his minivan while Gage jerked off upfront. I'd chase anything to feel alive, anything to quell the numbness. One day, something chased back. \n\n# Lewis, Gage, and I drove around looking for something to do. Sitting in the back of Lewis's minivan, I ignored Nookie blaring from the speakers with my hands clamped against my ears. I just wanted to forget asshole professors and the obnoxious amount of homework; didn’t they know we had lives? Gage snagged his red flannel sleeve as he passed me a joint from upfront. Mom'd cut funds, forcing me to work at McDonald's forever, if she knew I was partying, empirical proof I was a fuckup. A lump formed in my neck as my throat tightened. \n\n# I took a long drag. Fruity smoke flooded my mouth and singed my throat. I dissolved into the leather interior; my head slumped against the rest. I counted the number of cracks in the ceiling until a brown daddy longlegs skittered across and dropped on me. Cold pinpricks crept up my neck. I slapped my shoulder furiously like I was on fire.\n\n# \"It's a daddy longlegs, not a tarantula, pussy,\" Gage laughed. \n\n# Lewis stretched a tattooed hand out, a black widow inked across his knuckles, black wiry legs curled around his sausage fingers. \"Pass me a Bud!\"\n\n# \"Not while you're driving,\" Gage hesitated. \"One more DUI and you'll wind up with a face full of cold shower tiles.\" \n\n# \"'The last thing you need is another D.U.I.' What are you, my mommy?\" Lewis barked. \"Pass me a fuckin' beer!\"\n\n# Gage pushed a brew into Lewis's open hand. \"I guess it doesn't matter when mommy & daddy are the best lawyers in the state.\"\n\n# Lewis gulped down his beer, burped, and tossed the can out the window. \"My 'Daddy' got you probation instead of jail time for possession plus intent to distribute, shithead. He saved your downy ass from having your stupid face shoved into a mattress for the next five to twenty years,\" Lewis adjusted his sunglasses in the rearview. \"Besides, my parents' firm has a whole wing named after them. I could run over a preschooler until they looked like spaghetti and get a slap on the wrist.\"\n\n# I took another drag. \"When's the acid supposed to kick in?\"\n\n# Gage shrugged, cracking open a beer. \"Soon. It's been an hour since you took it.\"\n\n# I exhumed a gray cloud of smoke from my lungs. Wispy clouds of gray smoke stung my eyes. \"Where are we going?\" \n\n# \"Nowhere, Roy,\" Lewis said. \n\n# \"We can walk around Yellow Brooke for a bit. My sister, Brenna, and I smoke a bowl and hike there sometimes,\" Gage suggested. \"I've gotta take a piss anyways.\"\n\n#  Lewis snorted. \"Some creep got busted in those woods last year for dragging women off trail.\"\n\n#  \"When I heard about that—I thought it was you,” I ashed out the window. \n\n# Lewis's tires screeched as he swerved down Burroughs' Drive. I bounced in the air and bashed my head against the roof. \"Thanks, dickweed.\"\n\n# Lewis sniggered. \"Should've buckled up, buttercup.”\n\n# The road rippled and undulated like ocean waves. Trees pulsated as hairy, obsidian wolf-sized spiders scuttled across oaks; they melted into the trees, becoming one with them. Gage spilled out of the Odyssey when we pulled into the parking lot and sprinted for the forest. \n\n# I stared at the woods; colors of surrounding trees, bushes, and flowers, amplified swirling in complex, undulating kaleidoscope patterns. Pine and citrus mingled in the air, spreading over my taste buds like thick, sticky globs of creamy peanut butter. A divine calm settled in me. If I were on fire, I'd be like one of those burning Buddhist monks.\n\n# \"Are you done yet, Gage? What are you doing, sucking off Bigfoot?\" Lewis mocked.\n\n# \"It hasn't even been a minute, shithead,\" I flicked the roach at him. \"Don't worry, he wouldn't chug yeti cock without you, sweet pea.\"\n\n# Gage burst out of the woods, struggling to button his piss-soaked jeans. Sweat poured down his scruffy face. \"Guys! There's a girl trapped!\"\n\n# \"What's wrong? Couldn't stand more than thirty seconds away from your boyfriend, honey?\" I laughed. \n\n# Gage mopped sweat off his mug with the torn hem of his Radiohead shirt. \"No dipshit, I found a trapdoor by a tree. I heard someone from the other side crying for help.\"\n\n# \"Bullshit,\" Lewis scoffed.\n\n# Gage stabbed a calloused finger at the trail. \"Go check it.\"\n\n# We trailed the path—birds chirped their song, lilies swayed in the breeze. We came across a rotted green door with two chains glinted around a silver padlock and a rusted handle covered in flecks of amethyst, moss, twigs, and dead flies. \n\n# Lewis rolled his eyes. \"Are you sure you're hearing someone?\"\n\n# \"Please help me,\" a frail, feminine voice pleaded.\n\n# Gage grabbed the brass handle. \"It's okay, we're going to help you.\"\n\n# Lewis snatched Gage's arm. \"Stop! This is a trap. Don't you think it's a little too convenient that suddenly we hear a woman screaming for help? Let the cops handle this; my dad's drinking buddies with the chief.\"\n\n#  \"A man put me here. I haven't eaten or drunk for days; he did things to me,” The woman cried. \n\n# \"We can't leave her here,\" I said. \n\n# Lewis ripped Gage from the door. \"I'm not putting my ass on the line for a stranger. I don't wanna walk into a trap just because you want to be a hero!”\n\n# Gage jerked his arm free from Lewis's grasp. \"What if she's dead by the time we get help? What if that were your mother, asshole!\" His voice cracked as his hazel eyes swelled and his bottom lip trembled. \n\n# Lewis tore a clump of shaggy golden locks from his head, eyes darting around like a trapped rat. \"They're better equipped to handle this situation—fuck this, let's get out of here!\" \n\n# Gage pushed past Lewis and struggled with the door. \"Brenna would break her foot off in my ass if I didn't help this girl.”\n\n# I scanned the area, spotted a purple baseball-sized rock, and smashed the lock. \"I don't want her blood on my hands.\"\n\n# Gage flung the door open; a naked woman lay on the ground; she grimaced at the beams of sunlight striking her face. Gore and dirt caked her curly auburn hair, her sunken baby blue eyes submerged in an ocean of purpled, blackened flesh. Her delicate nose twisted in the opposite direction; blood solidified beneath her nostrils; yellow pus oozed from broken scabs on her swollen lips. Bruises and gashes covered her rangy arms, slender hips, and plum-sized breasts. \n\n# Gage jumped into the chasm and took off his flannel, draping it over her. \"Can you walk, ma'am?\"\n\n# “No,” the woman wiped tears away. \n\n# Gage brushed dirt off her hair. \"What's your name?\"\n\n# \"Lola,\" she grasped Gage's hand and brought it to her cheek.\n\n# Gage rested his hand on her brittle shoulder. \"Okay, I'm Gage. We'll get you out.\" \n\n# \"I owe you my life,” Lola's flesh pulsated and twitched as if roaches were inside.\n\n#  My heart jackhammered, my muscles constricted, and a yellow tsunami tore through my guts as suffocating panic  consumed me. Lola seized his arm and tore it off; brown-red arches sprayed the dirt. He dropped to his knees. He stared at the once incapacitated Lola as she tore at the limb like a lion ripping at a gazelle's throat. Yellow liquid oozed from her mouth as she devoured, dissolving the limb. A horrible sound, like someone slurping noodles, flooded the cavern. \n\n# Eight black spindly legs exploded from Lola's back, thick and bristling. Her mouth stretched and contorted, growing wider to reveal two icicle-sized opal fangs. Eyes on her forehead and cheeks that weren't there before opened one by one; eight amethyst eyes glowed like cold gems and stared back at me. Rigid brown setae spread over her, and the creature grew larger, metamorphosing into something with clacking mandibles. \n\n# Lewis picked up a rock and hurled it at the abomination, chipping one of its fangs. \"Why'd you have to play the hero?\"\n\n# My brain froze. I couldn't take my eyes off that thing. I was like a fly caught in a web. I picked up a fist-sized rock and pegged the beast in one of its orbs. It shrieked as its eye snapped shut; Gage kicked a leg out from under the creature, sending it crashing. Gage struggled to his feet; he flattened a wiry leg beneath his boot and ground his heel down hard as it screeched in agony; a pool of yellow fluid seeped beneath his steel toe. My hand pistoned out as Gage ambled towards me. I gripped his hand, sweaty and slick with blood. Lewis hooked his arms around his waist, pulled him up, and dusted him off. I hugged him, and Lewis ruffled his shaggy brown hair. \n\n# A web shot out of the darkness, plastered on his back and heaved him back down. Gage's eyes filled with tears as he stretched his hand out; the spider's silhouette engulfed him. Another web hit the door and slammed shut with a rattle. I yanked the handle, but it broke off in my hand. I punched the door until my knuckles were bruised, bloody, and cut. Helplessness washed over me like a gray tidal wave. Tears poured down my freckles.\n\n#  Screaming. Shredding. Snapping. \n\n# All lanced through my mind like a hot iron spike. Pressure built in my brain until it felt like it was about to pop; this wasn't real. My skin felt cold and clammy as if I were sitting in the bath for too long. Gage was gone. \"I-I had him. I fucking had him,\" I sobbed. \n\n# \"W-we just can't leave him here,\" Lewis pushed me aside and wedged his fingers beneath the door. I squatted beside him and crammed my fingers below the door, splinters jammed under my fingernails. My muscles burned, and my hands went numb. We dashed for the van when the screams stopped. \n\n# I had him….\n\n# At the police station, the cops side-eyes us as we told our story. Lewis kept sniffling and brushed tears away. I couldn't stop my lips from quivering. They didn't care about the drugs; the focus was on Lola and Gage. We told them we found a woman underneath a trapdoor in Yellow Brooke, and Gage jumped into the cavern to save her. They didn't find the door, nor did they find Gage or Lola. Lewis and I were prime suspects in his disappearance since we were the last ones to see him. Eventually, we were let go because there was no evidence Lewis or I killed Gage. Even though we were innocent in the eyes of the law, in the eyes of the public, we were guilty.\n\n# A rumor that Lewis and I were Satanists and sacrificed Gage floated around campus. Some professors were visibly uncomfortable around me, and some even suggested that I transfer schools. Gage's family held a vigil in his honor. When I showed up, Brenna made a B-line for me. Brown hair dangled over red, puffy, seafoam green eyes. She hocked a loogie in my eye, slapped me across the face, and disappeared into the crowd. Someone scratched 'KILLER' into the hood of my jeep. His family also had the police in their sights; they publicly criticized the lack of effort to find their son and accused the chief of knowing what happened to Gage and covering it up at the behest of Lewis's parents.\n\n#  The family announced that if the police wouldn't help them, they would conduct their investigation and find out what happened to Gage. Gage's parents, a few other family members, and friends went into Yellow Brooke, determined to find answers. They were never seen again. \n\n# After Yellow Brooke, I took school seriously (I couldn't let Gage's demise be for nothing). From then on, I stayed sober; drugs were just another reminder. I refused to date for a decade; every girl looked like Lola. Lewis skipped class and stopped hanging out with me; he was like a ghost. Lewis dropped out of college and got a job at FedEx, stacking boxes and dodging eye contact. A mutual friend ran into him at the bar a few years ago. Lewis was skeletally thin, sallow-skinned, working the graveyard shift at 7-Eleven, selling meth out of the back. Half of his teeth were gone, the rest piss yellow and rotten, and he wore a red flannel. Lewis said he saw the door in his dreams every night and always felt like something was watching him. His parents cut him off after Gage's vigil, calling him a liability, saying his rotten 'Satanist' stench tarnished their family's name and the firm's rep. Left him with nothing, they bolted to Florida. I read his obituary last year (I wish I had been there for him).\n\n# Twenty years later, fear of that night still haunts me. I still wake up gagging on Gage's screams. His wide eyes seared into my mind. It should've been me. For decades, I buried Yellow Brooke deep inside: I sobered up, married Sasha, had a daughter, and started a business. Sasha held my hand at breakfast, and I half-expected her to rip it off. I swallowed the urge to peg Mia with a rock when she got off the bus this afternoon. A few times a year, I visit Gage's cenotaph. Last night, I saw a news story resurrecting yellow dread: three college kids went to Yellow Brooke. Two returned, and the other didn't: Gunther Gomes, 20. No corpse, no answers. The same helplessness that swallowed me all those years ago swallowed me again. Gage was twenty when he died. I got hammered for the first time in twenty years. It's too late for him, but not for you: please, stay the hell away from Yellow Brooke!"},"58":{"title":"Alone In The Woods, Something Else Is Here...","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kflale\/alone_in_the_woods_something_else_is_here\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Remarkable_Ebb9987","selftext":"Hello everyone, this is my first story. I've always wanted to write one after listening to stories for years and I'd appreciate your feedback 😁.\n\nI opened my eyes to stars out in the night sky, a light rain splashed on my face. As I came to my senses, a sharp pain boomed in my ankle, it was definitely badly twisted and swollen. My arms and legs burned from the stings of yellow jackets. My head boomed from it's impact with the ground. My memory of running away and slipping off the side of the trail was coming back to me. When I set out earlier that day on a hike in the Smoky Mountains I hadn't planned on ending up like this. I'm not sure how far I fell, but I was out for the past few hours. The sun was now setting, I needed to find a way out of here before nightfall. Running into a black bear at night in the woods is not a good idea. \n\nMy body ached as I hoisted myself off the ground. I broke off a nearby stick from a fallen tree to help prop up my swollen ankle as I walked. Thankfully my gear had stayed in the bag and what didn't was nearby. Thinking back, I'm glad I changed the batteries in my flashlight before I left. I flicked the flashlight on and tried to get my bearings of where I was. The hill I had fallen from there was no chance I was going to make it back up with this ankle, I'd need to find another way out. At that moment I remembered I had a phone, immediately seaching the area I found it in the dirt. The screen was cracked, there was some raindrops on it, but it was still working. The time was 7:48pm, and as expected, I have no signal. Most of the park there was no signal, so this didn't come as a surprise.\n\nBased off where I landed I ultimately decided to head west. Hoping that I would come across another trail and be able to double back towards the parking lot I left my car, or find someone else that could assist me. I walked for what felt like hours, around downed trees, large boulders, and avoiding some unpleasant wildlife. By now, the sun was setting and I decided I had no choice but to set up camp and wait till morning, there was no use wandering in the dark. My time in the Boy Scouts as a kid taught me a few things about being in the woods, but that was years ago, adult life — work, had consumed me and kept me away from those skills for a long time. I gathered some firewood and thanked myself for being prepared with matches and some dryer lint to get a small fire going. It took a couple tries but before like I had a good fire going. Thankfully, I had to sense to go camping in the spring instead of winter. It would get cool tonight but I wouldn't freeze to death. I was starving, rummaging in my bag I found a couple granola bars, some peanuts, and a PBJ sandwich that may not be good any more. I wolfed down the sandwich not caring if I would pay for it later. Hopefully later I would be out of here. I placed my pack on the ground a few feet from the fire and laid down on it as a pillow hoping to get at least a few hours sleep to continue my journey tomorrow. My ankle thanked me for finally giving it a break from it's duties.\n\nI awoke startled, I had heard something nearby scuffle. A broken branch, the rustling of some leaves. Ever since my daughter was born I had become a light sleeper. I sat up visually inspecting the area for bears, or coyotes. I unsheathed my hunting knife, at the ready if I needed to fend off an animal, but it was silent. Actually... it was too silent. There was no sound at all but the slow crackle of what was left of my fire. No chirp of crickets, no singing of birds, no rustling of squirrels, no wind in the leaves, it was as if the forest had came to a stop.\n\nI heard a low rumble out to my left, as if the forest was upset by my presence here. Unclear of what I was hearing, anxiety was creeping up the back of my neck. It was then I heard someone whisper to me. It sounded like a man, but something was off about his whispered tone, it sounded forced and unnatural. As if whatever called to me had to force itself to produce the words. Every hair on my body stood tall. My flashlight flickered, I smacked it hoping it didnt turn off. I grabbed my things and decided it was best to get the hell out of here, even if it meant wandering in the dark. I threw my pack on my back and a torch from the fire and hurried off in the other direction. Not sure where I was going, I just knew I needed to get far away from whatever was happening back there. Careful to not trip over logs I hobbled as quickly as I could through the forest. It sounded as if whatever it was had chosen not to pursue me. I wondered why, but I wasn't going to find out. \n\nAfter some time I come across a cabin. It was very old, and clearly had been abandoned a long time ago. Was this pure luck? Or was i meant to find this cabin? There's not exactly a cabin on every hill around here. The windows were boarded up, it appeared to have a few leaks in the roof, but the door was still solid. It seems the previous owner had left in a hurry and had not locked the door. I took advantage of this considering my situation and proceeded inside. Carefully, I checked the cabin for any unwanted inhabitants and found none. I closed the front door and propped an old chair in front of it as well as the chain lock the previous owner installed. I searched the cabin and found a bunch of empty cabinets, any food they contained was long since foraged, there was trash on the counter. There also was a bed in the backroom.\n\nExhausted, and in pain from my injuries I carefully sat down on the musty bed, it's sheets long expired, testing it's strength to make sure it could hold my weight. It creaked but did not give way. Upon laying down I felt something hard underneath the old pillow, it was a book. Curious, I opened the book and right away it was clear whoever wrote this was very distraught.\n\nSeptember 4th: Something is outside tonight. They beckon me to join them in the darkness. Matilda thinks I am hearing things, I don't know why she can't hear them. We have lived here for years and I have never encountered demons such as this. I am keeping this journal as a record of my encounters with them.\n\nSeptember 8th: They have come again. They call to me to join them outside, in the woods. I do not know their intentions. Matilda still does not hear them. The last encounter kept me up all night. I do not know what they are but I dare not go outside to find out.\n\nSeptember 12th: Matilda can hear them now. She finally believes me. I boarded up the windows after our last encounter and added a chain lock to the door. They have started picking and tapping at the windows, calling our names. \"John... please.. help us... John.. come outside.. please..\" How do they know our names?\n\nSeptember 15th: I finally saw one. Those things, monsters, whatever they are. I peered out the window tonight very carefully and the lamp on the porch illuminated just enough for me to catch a horrifying glimpse. It didn't stand more than 4 feet tall, hunched over and very thin, it's slimy pale skin reflecting off the light. It's yellow eyes glowing in the light, full of hatred and hunger. Razor sharp claws protruded from the end of it's bony fingers. Matilda and I nearly screamed in horror, covering each other's mouths so as to not alert them to our fear. And just like that it was gone, escaped back into the shadow of the night. Worse, I can see their eyes now, faintly in the darkness, watching.\n\nSeptember 16th: They are here, but they do not speak. Have they been here every night watching us? When do they choose to speak to us? I see their faint yellow eyes in the darkness. Dozens of them...\n\nSeptember 17th: I have had enough of this madness, I told Matilda we are leaving in the morning. We will leave this cursed place and never return. God protect us from these demons.\n\nThat was the last entry in the book. My skin crawled at the thought of those creatures. As I laid there I  wondered if the bizarre enoucter i had earlier had something to do with these creatures. Just then, I began hearing whispers, calling my name.. \"Sean, please help us Sean.... come outside..please... help us..\" I began hearing tapping on the windows. I screamed \"LEAVE ME ALONE!!\" but they persisted. My flashlight flickered like a light show. They are scratching the walls with their long talons. I see red on the floor that I had never seen before, it's probably the blood of those poor people. I jumped to my feet, they are banging against the door,  I dont think its going to hold, the hinges are getting weaker. I readied my knife for whatever happens.\n\nThey broke the door, I rushed the first one on it's way inside, stabbing it's skull as hard and fast as I could. Blood spewed from it's head onto my clothes. It quickly dropped to the floor in a heap. The second swiped at me with it's talons, slicing my leg open. I lunged forward, plunging my knife into it's neck. It screeched an ungodly noise unlike anything I have ever heard. It too, fell in a heap. This must have gave the others pause, I wasted no time, I didn't even grab my bag I just ran, out the door as fast as I could. My ankle was on fire but I knew if I wanted to live I needed to keep moving. I don't know how long I ran or even where I was going, but I didn't stop till the sun had risen and a rosy couple that was hiking found me passed out near a trailhead. \n\nI was airlifted to the nearest hospital in critical condition. My ankle was fractured and badly swollen. My leg was severely cut from the creature and I will likely have tendon damage. I had a minor concussion from my fall, and was also severely dehydrated. I'm thankful I was able to make it out alive.\n\nSome suits visited me and started questioning me about what happened. I told them they would never believe me, and showed them on a map where I believe I fell, and they revealed the biggest mystery of all, my jaw nearly hit the floor. I was found over 50 miles from my originally planned hike. There's no way I traveled that far. I told them what happened at the cabin and they were not even phased, like they had heard worse. They told me they are launching an investigation into finding the cabin and would keep me apprised of major developments.\n\nThe doctors told me I can go home here in a few days. I told know what is going on in those woods, but it is evil and unnatural. I will never set foot in those woods again as long as those creatures are out there."},"59":{"title":"The photo copy printer","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kfbi2q\/the_photo_copy_printer\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"shortstory1","selftext":"When I wanted to photo copy my face from the printer, what came out on the paper was not my face but someone else's face.

It looked depressing and then I told someone about it and showed them what I was experiencing, they then photocopied their own face. They experienced the very same thing and what came out on paper, was another depressing sad looking face. \n\nThen my sister called me and she told me that she is 7 months pregnant. I was confused because she has no baby bump and shows no signs of being pregnant. Then my sister said that the reason she is showing no signs of pregnancy, is because her baby inside her womb has no body or organs. Her husband has a condition which is whenever he gets someone pregnant, the unborn baby will have no body or organs. My sister is excited an so is her husband. I was still more concerned with the printer thing though. \n\nI went to the printer at work and photocopied my face but still, whenever the paper came out it didn't show my face but some other face. Then as more workers figured out about what the printer was doing, they tried it themselves. No matter what they looked like, what came out of the printer was a depressing looking man's face. Some of the women started to become scared and hysterical, and they hated the printer for not printing out what they looked like. \n\nThen I kept photo copying my face, and when I observed what the printer had printed out, I concentrated on the sadness and suffering. Then word went round that all of the printers in the building were printing the same sad looking face, whenever someone photocopied their face. One guy who photo copied his ass had become hysterical, when the printer still printed out someone else's ass. \n\nThen my sister called telling me that her baby with no body or organs, is due to be born. Her husband was going to take her to a special place for such babies to be born. Then her husband called me after a couple of hours and he said \"your sister is dead and I have taken her organs\" and he also told me where her body was. \n\nI then retrieved my dead sister and when I photo copied her face on the printer, her face was actually on the paper when it printed out.

As i expected...We played the game at first 1-2 days it seemed normal no random generations no weird mob nothing my friends already started not believing me and i also started to think that maybe cindy's weird dumb logic is true but later one day 2 friends and i decided to collect woods for our house and sent our other friend to mine, after sometime we heard his screams coming from the call , he said \" THERE, THERE IS A SCARY BLACK MONSTER WITH GLOWING EYES TRYING TO KILL ME ITS SO SCARY, ITS SUPER DARK TOO, I DON'T BELIEVE ITS ANY NEW MINECRAFT SECRET MOB!?!\" and then he respawned in our base and a message popped \"ieatkarenfordinner got killed by an unknown entity\"(btw the username is crazy💀) and then...My friend \"icookchinesetoavoidcovid19\" really went serious he decided to investigate more about it, strange thing he thought was that the monster only appear at night and that also when we are away from our base and separated the way when we were close the monster separated us to attack was crazy now according to his calculations the next target will be him only as he is the only one who didn't see the monster so he decided to stay with me in the base because i also wasn't attacked but i saw him...It was kinda scary then my friend \"icookchinesetoavoidcovid19\" asked \"ieatkarenfordinner\" whether he invited any player, but there was no other player other than me and my other 3 friends , after that the world with normal generations just changed, redstones everywhere like blood, and then random blocks placed like smile, but as much we remembered this was not like this, it suddenly changed so we decided to stay together rather then getting separated, then we were all cutting woods then suddenly everything went dark, we were shouting to each other \"where are you! Where are you guys!!\" Then one of my friends started screaming telling the same kind of creature \"carlhatescindy'sdumblogic\"(me) and \"ieatkarenfordinner\" saw he is seeing , and he is following him and after some screams, darkness went away and a message appeared \"iwillkillteacherswhogivemefbutinfuture got killed by an unknown entity\" and then he respawned at our base then...Everything felt fine at first but then our friends \"ieatkarenfordinner\" and \"iwillkillteacherswhogivemefbutinfuture\" who went out to mine said that the mining area from where they had come from have changed and now they are stuck and lost\"we can talk to them because we are playing the game with group call\" later they started saying that they saw the monster seeing them but didn't attack them seemed so weird then i remembered that i was already attacked by the monster 2-3 years ago i think thats why he didn't attack me but just was near me and in my sight, come to think of it \"icookchinesetoavoidcovid19\" is the only one who is not attacked, he must be his next target...Myfriend\"icookchinesetoavoidcovid19\" didn't wanted to remain in fear anymore and thought if this time he is killed and respawned he will just see him from far like others, he got killed by him by going out of the base and respawned, but we didn't knew he planned for this to make us trust him that he don't kill us the second time...They went to sleep thinking they will repair the device and we were still in the game we didn't knew that at that time cause for us suddenly they left that server and the call got ended, i will tell you what happened to them that night before i tell what happened to me and \"icookchinesetoavoidcovid19\", it was truly horrifying...We played the game and later we saw mobs just same our friends skin, but our friends was not in server, it ran and me and \"icookchinesetoavoidcovid19\" followed them it led to a secret room where it had a huge screen with literally recording of us taken from the windows of our room!! \"Ieatkarenfordinner\" and \"Iwillkillteacherswhogivemefbutinfuture\" was sleeping while me and \"icookchinesetoavoidcovid19\" was playing we looked back at the window and for a moment we saw two horrifying glowing eyes, and it dissapeared then and we tried to leave the game but it couldn't suddenly the screen glitched and a voice came \"i always seee you, and will always see you forever, don't worry i won't hurt you... for now\" and then the screen glitched and went black just like \"iwillkillteacherswhogivemefbutinfuture\" and \"Ieatkarenfordinner\" then we tried to sleep but we kept thinking of that later we heard breathing sounds coming outside of the window but outside it was too dark... unusual dark for full night it happened we were not able to sleep we thought it just happened to us but when we went school we get to know even worse happened to others...\"ieatkarenfordinner\" whose actual name is jake and \"iwillkillteacherswhogivemefbutinfuture\" whose actual name is mike told me and \"icookchinesetoavoidcovid19\" whose actual name is Cevin about what happened to them they told there was a creature outside the window with glowing eyes staring at them the whole night, they hid it with curtain but heard breathing noises and weird other noises like chuckling, at night they heard a deep voice \"i won't hurt you... atleast for now\" they were not able to sleep at all then we told everything to them too Every night where we are as soon as sun sets we see it everywhere like hiding somewhere we can see it staring to us but not others it always follows us and one day it says \"you're safe... but let me see till when?\"\n\n"},"61":{"title":"Trying to find a story I read years ago- details of it below","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kfidcf\/trying_to_find_a_story_i_read_years_ago_details\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"WhiskeyRiot01","selftext":"It read as such: a person opens the door to their apartment to find a creature tearing apart the flesh of another in some grotesque detail, referencing the rancid smell and horrid sight.

The subject of the report, a single occupant of a residential property in [redacted] County, placed multiple emergency calls over the course of six days—each escalating in urgency. The final call came at 3:17 AM on November 18 and ended abruptly. Responding officers arrived on scene and made entry into the home.\n\n⸻\n\n[November 14]\n\nI don’t know exactly when the weird stuff started. I think it’s been going on for a while, but I’ve only just started to notice. Now every time I think back to something that could have been linked to forgetfulness or coincidence, my hair stands on edge.\n\nIt started with small things: a book being misplaced, the thermostat being changed, or the doormat being shifted. Last night though, I woke up at 2:46 AM. I remember the exact time because I checked my phone. I thought I’d heard something upstairs—like slow, steady footsteps. Just four or five of them, then nothing. Maybe it was a tree branch knocking against the house? Maybe it was the house settling? I told myself all kinds of excuses to make my mind stop racing, but it didn’t feel like that. It felt… intentional.\n\nWhen I got out of bed this morning, the hallway light was on. I never leave that light on. Ever. And my bedroom door, which I know I shut, was open about six inches. I stood there staring like an idiot for a full minute, just trying to convince myself I’d forgotten. That I was just tired. That I’m stressed. But I swear I remember lying in bed with a cold sweat, thinking about the footsteps or the knocking I heard last night and the only light being from my dimmed phone screen. In fact, it felt darker than it ever has in my life.\n\n⸻\n\nTRANSCRIPT – 911 CALL\n\nDate: November 14\nTime: 11:42 AM\nCaller: Susan Armstrong\nCall Type: Suspicious Activity\n\nDISPATCH: 911, what’s your emergency?\nCALLER: Uh, hi. Yeah, I’m sorry, I-I’m not even sure this is an emergency.\nDISPATCH: That’s okay. Just tell me what’s going on. Where are you right now?\nCALLER: I live alone, and I’ve been hearing noises upstairs. Footsteps. Like, actual walking. I live at [redacted]. I thought it might be the HVAC or something but it’s too… rhythmic? I checked the attic myself, didn’t see anything, but I’m still hearing it, and I’m freaked out.\nDISPATCH: Do you believe someone might be inside your home? Does anyone else have access?\nCALLER: I-I don’t know. I don’t think so. The doors were locked, and nothing looks disturbed, but it doesn’t feel right. My friend Lauren has a key, but she hasn’t been over.\nDISPATCH: Okay, officers are on the way. Are you safe?\nCALLER: Yeah, I’m downstairs. I just—I know I sound paranoid. I just needed someone to hear me say it out loud. I feel crazy.\nDISPATCH: It’s no trouble. Officers are on the way. Stay on the line until they arrive.\n(pause)\nCALLER: It’s just quiet now. Completely quiet. Like whoever—or whatever—it was… stopped. Or is listening.\n\n⸻\n\nREPORT LOG – Officer D. Westbrook and Officer R. Allen\n\nTime on Scene: 11:56 AM – 12:22 PM\n\nConducted walkthrough of property at resident’s request. No signs of forced entry. Attic and crawlspaces checked—clear. Subject appeared nervous but coherent. Reported items out of place in home over previous days, but nothing stolen. Home otherwise orderly. Subject advised to contact HVAC technician regarding potential structural noises. No further action taken.\n\n⸻\n\n[November 15]\n\nDidn’t sleep again. Not sure how anyone could with the sounds above my head. I kept hearing the vent rattle in a way that doesn’t make sense unless someone is up there tapping it. Like a pattern. Like breathing.\n\nThere was a granola bar wrapper on the counter this morning. I haven’t had those in the house in over a week. Did I forget I bought one? Am I that tired?\n\nI called Lauren this afternoon. Left a message. I was embarrassed, so I tried to make it sound funny—said something about needing a priest or an exorcist. I don’t think she ever called back.\n\n⸻\n\n[November 16]\n\nMaybe it’s because I watched a scary movie. Maybe it’s because I’m scared to sleep. Today, I decided maybe the joke I made yesterday wasn’t a joke. I was raised “religious.” My dad was an alcoholic who cheated on my mom, and my mother committed suicide—but that didn’t stop her from making us go to church every Sunday until she died.\n\nI called a local priest and asked him to come over.\n\nLast night the bumps didn’t stop. I found a door open that I know was shut. I can’t tell if I’m being haunted, but something isn’t right.\n\nHe didn’t say much when he arrived. Just looked around. Asked if I’d had trouble sleeping. If I felt safe. If I was having spiritual symptoms. I didn’t know how to answer.\n\n“It’s not a demon,” he said eventually.\n“I didn’t say that it was.”\n“People always jump to that. Noises in the house. Feeling watched. Doors open. Lights flickering. They want it to be spiritual because that’s easier than thinking they’re losing control. But this—”\n\nHe gestured to the ceiling.\n\n“—this doesn’t feel like a haunting.”\n\nThat should’ve made me feel better. It didn’t.\n\nHe prayed with me. I didn’t really listen. I was too focused on the faint creak upstairs. I’m not sure he even heard it.\n\nHe left after twenty minutes. Told me to get some rest. Said I should try sleeping with a light on.\n\n“Nothing wrong with that.”\n\n⸻\n\n[November 16 – Late Evening]\n\nI didn’t want to write this. It’s hard to even type.\n\nI found a pair of my underwear on the laundry room floor tonight. Not in the basket. Just… on the tile, like it had been dropped. They were clean. Folded. I remember putting them away.\n\nI opened the drawer to check. Everything else was there.\n\nI’ve been telling myself it’s stress. That I’m overtired and forgetting things. But I don’t forget things like this. Not this clearly.\n\nSomething shifted upstairs. Not a creak—something moved. I froze in the hallway and listened. It went quiet again. Like it knew.\n\nI sat on the couch for hours. Couldn’t bring myself to go back to my room.\n\nLauren still hasn’t called me back.\n\n⸻\n\nTRANSCRIPT – 911 CALL\n\nTime: 11:58 PM\nCaller: Susan Armstrong\nCall Type: Possible Intruder\n\nDISPATCH: 911, what is your emergency?\nCALLER (whispering): Hi, yes—I need someone to come to my house.\nDISPATCH: Can you confirm your address?\nCALLER: [Redacted]\nDISPATCH: What’s happening?\nCALLER: I think there’s someone inside my house.\nDISPATCH: Are you in a safe place right now?\nCALLER: I’m in the hallway closet. I didn’t know where else to go.\nDISPATCH: Is the door locked?\nCALLER: Yes.\nDISPATCH: What makes you think someone’s in your home?\nCALLER: I heard them. Moving. Above me. And I found… I found something earlier that wasn’t where I left it. Something personal.\n(pause)\nDISPATCH: Has anyone else been in your home today?\nCALLER: No. No one. I live alone.\n(sound: soft creak on floorboards)\nCALLER (whispers): Please, please just send someone.\nDISPATCH: Officers are en route. Stay on the line with me.\nCALLER: I don’t want to move. I don’t want them to know I’m here.\n(silence)\n(very faint sound: movement overhead)\n(caller breathes heavily)\nCALLER (almost inaudible): It’s in the walls.\n\n⸻\n\nREPORT LOG – Officer M. Leclair and Officer J. Rivers\n\nTime on Scene: 12:06 AM – 12:37 AM\n\nResponded to 911 call from resident reporting potential intruder. Caller located inside hallway closet, unharmed but visibly distressed. Full walkthrough conducted. No signs of forced entry. Attic hatch closed. No tampering visible. No suspect found. Resident advised to seek temporary relocation. Declined.\n\n⸻\n\n[November 17]\n\nI didn’t sleep again. I thought exhaustion would catch up to me eventually, but it hasn’t. If anything, I feel more alert. Not awake—just vigilant. Like I’m waiting.\n\nEverything was quiet again today. Not peaceful. Just still. The kind of still that makes your ears ring.\n\nI walked the perimeter of the house. Windows locked. Latches secure. Nothing out of place. Except the photo frame in the living room—it was turned. Not knocked over. Just turned, facing the hallway.\n\nAround sunset, I stood under the attic hatch. I didn’t open it. Just stared at it. I could feel something up there. Not a presence. Not a ghost. Just… an awareness.\n\nI think I’m done waiting.\n\nI think I’m going to open the wall.\n\n⸻\n\nFINAL POLICE REPORT – November 18\n\nTime on Scene: 3:25 AM\nResponding Officers: Sgt. E. Carrow, Ofc.

She had the kindest eyes anyone could have, the softest skin to touch. The most beautiful smile.  \nI... I really don’t know how to explain what happened.  \nI just know I failed.\n\nIt all started a few years ago:\n\nI woke up at 3 a.m. to a call from Amy. She was crying—sobbing. Another fight with her mom? Probably. They hadn’t spoken in over a month, but who knows.\n\n“*I need your help*.”  \nThat’s all she said. And that was enough. It didn’t matter that I had a shift in four hours.\n\nI washed up, grabbed my coat, and left. Her house was only ten minutes away, but it felt like an eternity. I was riddled with worry. When Amy called me like that, I always knew there was something wrong.\n\nAs soon as I got out of the car, I could hear her crying. \"Oh no\", I thought. This time it sounds serious.\n\n“*Hey, Amy, it’s me, Dan! What happened?*”  \nI knocked, and she appeared. She looked so fragile, yet hugged me with such strength I thought she’d never let go. But she did.\n\n“*I need to show you something.*”  \nShe looked at me with tearful eyes and waited for a response.\n\n*“Are you okay?”*  \nI asked, and she just nodded.\n\n*“Just… come with me.”*  \nShe took my hand and pulled me inside. I felt uneasy—especially after the last time I’d been there. Speaking of which, a question popped into my mind: where were her parents?\n\nI didn’t get the chance to ask. She stopped in front of the bathroom door.\n\n*“It’s… in here.”*  \nShe looked serious.\n\n*“What? Is there something in your bathroom?”*  \nI was already getting annoyed. If she called me at 3 a.m. because of a bug or something, I was going to be pissed. But that wasn’t it.  \nShe wasn’t scared. She was just different. Almost... hopeful?\n\n*“It’s over!\"* \\- She shouted, her face bearing a blank look of disbelief. - *\"I trapped it in here!”*  \nSuddenly, a strange smile appeared on her face as she hugged me again.  \n*\"What the hell is going on?\",* I thought.\n\n*“Amy, is it a rat? I mean, I can handle a bug, but a rat is—”*  \n*“It’s over, Dan! I found it!\"* \\- She interrupted, gleefully. - *\"I trapped it forever! Now I can move on!*”  \nHer smile widened, and she started crying again.\n\n*“Move on from what? What do you mean, Ames?”*  \nI was beyond confused. What had she done?\n\n*“Don’t worry. Now we can be happy.”*  \nShe looked at me, eyes filled with the most genuine joy I'd ever seen.\n\n*“Amy, I don’t understand. What’s in there? What did you do?”*  \nShe just hugged me again.\n\n*“Let’s go to bed, love. You have work in like, six hours.”*  \nShe said it confidently—like nothing had happened over the past six months.\n\nI tried to get answers all night. She just kept repeating:  \n*“Just don’t open the door.”*  \n*“It’s okay, I trapped him.”*  \n*“He won’t come out unless I let him.”*  \n*“Now we can be a normal couple. Everything’s fine!”*\n\nNothing seemed fine. After we went to bed, I was up for a while, my head spinning with theories.\n\nThen, I felt Amy tug at my arm, her grip strong with despair. She was having a nightmare, thrashing from side to side, mumbling louder and louder. I touched her cheek and turned her face toward me. Her eyes were open.\n\nSuddenly, she started screaming, almost crushing my upper arm:\n\n*“DON’T OPEN THE DOOR! PLEASE! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DON’T OPEN IT! HE’LL KILL ME! I DON’T WANT TO DIE! I DON’T WANT TO BE ALONE!”*\n\nI shook her, trying to wake her up, and she thrashed for a bit before going still. She stared at me until she broke the silence.\n\n*“Just don’t open the door.”*  \nHer eyes cut through me.\n\n*“Okay, love, I won’t—”*  \n*“Promise.”*  \nShe pressed my arm, gently.\n\n*“Promise me, and we’ll be happy. Together.”*  \n*“I… I promise.”*  \nWe went back to sleep.\n\nWith time, Amy got better. Happier. Happier than ever. Her parents stopped hurting her. She finally believed me when I told her she was beautiful.\n\nMonths flew by. We got engaged. Then, almost suddenly, married. I moved into her house, just to make sure the door stayed shut.  \nEventually, we kind of forgot about it all.\n\nWe enjoyed our early married life. Dates, friends, laughter. A happy, normal life.  \nSometimes I’d pass by the door. Always closed. Always locked.  \nWe were too happy to care.\n\nBut *it* hadn’t forgotten.\n\nIt started with a small red rot on the wood, right by the doorknob.  \nI noticed it one morning after waking up. No idea how long it had been there.  \nAmy hadn’t noticed, so I carefully removed the rotten wood, filled it with wood putty, and painted over it.\n\nA few weeks later—it was back.  \nI fixed it again.  \nNext day, it returned.  \nI fixed it again. And again.  \nEach time I repaired it, it came back, exactly the same, for weeks.\n\nI began waking up an hour earlier just to fix it before Amy noticed.  \nSee, Amy was a painter, so she usually woke up much later than me to work on commissions.\n\nI got used to the routine. Had my own cabinet for tools and putty.  \nWhen Amy asked about it, I called it my “Husband Cabinet.”  \nShe laughed and joke-bragged abou how she married a “strong, handy man.”  \nIf only she knew.  \nBut she couldn’t know. She’d panic. God knows what she'd do.\n\nThings were fine the way they were. I was happy to help.  \nAnd she was… she was happy.  \nI adjusted to my new morning ritual.\n\nThen the nightmares started.\n\nEvery other night, I dreamt that I forgot to fix the rot, or missed a crack.  \nI started going to bed worried that this time, the dream was real.  \nI’d wake up multiple times a night just to check the door.  \nEach morning, I was more exhausted—and more afraid.  \nThen I’d see Amy, sleeping so peacefully.  \n“It’s worth it,” I’d think.\n\nBut soon it wasn’t just one rotten spot.  \nTwo, three more showed up—this time on the hinges.  \nI started fixing those too. But they were getting bigger.  \nI had to wake up even earlier just to fix them.\n\nIt got to be too much.  \nEventually, Amy caught me.\n\n*“What are you doing?”*  \nShe appeared behind me one morning.\n\n*“Oh, hey love! Umm… just fixing the door…”*  \nI looked at her as panic crept over her face.\n\n*“Why? What’s wrong with it? What are you doing?” -* She asked, starting to panic.  \n*“Love, it’s okay!”* I hugged her. *“I’m fixing it, I always do, it's really no problem!”* I said—without thinking.  \nThen I realized what I’d just confessed.\n\n*“What do you mean always? What is going on? How long has this been happening?”*  \nShe looked scared. Really scared. Her eyes were locked on the door like a deer in headlights.  \nShe was in danger.  \nI got serious and said:  \n*“It’s been happening every day for the last few months. But it’s okay. I can fix it. I* ***do*** *fix it.”*\n\nShe kept staring.  \n*“Then* ***we*** *need to fix it.”*  \nShe didn’t really speak to me for a whole week.\n\nAfter that, she started waking up with me to watch me fix it.  \nThen she started helping.  \nThen, she started obsessing.\n\nShe checked the door hourly.  \nCleaned it. Tended to every crack.  \nIt became her only concern.  \nShe grew cold, tense. She could never relax.\n\nShe stopped going out, stopped seeing friends, stopped watching her TV shows.  \nShe painted facing the door, always watching.  \nShe abandoned everything else.\n\nShe eventually painted the door bright blue—so the cracks would show more clearly.\n\nIt became our secret habit.  \nAnd it was about to get worse.\n\nOne night, I was leaving the other bathroom to go to bed when I heard it.  \nA faint scratching noise—subtle enough to go unnoticed at first.  \nBut it was there.\n\nThe first time I ever heard anything *from the other side* of the Blue Door.\n\nI backed away.  \nI went to bed, resisting the urge to open it.  \nI tried to sleep.\n\nI woke up five times drenched in sweat.  \nEach time, I heard the scratching again. Louder.\n\nThis went on for about a week.\n\nThe sounds started changing after that. Sometimes I'd hear things falling, people talking, calling me in. Other times someone would scream extremely loudly, then silence. All accompanied by that same scratching noise.  \nThen, one night… the sounds stopped. All of them.\n\nI looked around, then stood up.  \nThrough the bedroom door, I saw something I never expected:\n\nThe Blue Door was ajar.\n\nI crept through the house, careful not to wake Amy.  \nI approached the door. Somehow the rot had grown again, but this time it was everywhere. The whole door was filled with red veins of red rot, while the cracking noise grew louder and louder.  \nI stopped walking when I heard a noise.\n\nSomeone was… crying?  \nThe sound came from inside.\n\nThe door was slightly open, but I couldn’t see anything.\n\nI tried to hold back. I swear I did.  \nI stood there, questioning every decision I’d made.\n\nWhat if it was Amy? What if she went in? What if—  \nI had no choice.\n\nI entered, flashlight on.\n\nIt looked like a normal bathroom at first. Beige tiles, brown patterns.  \nBut as I turned to see more, everything changed.\n\nDecay covered everything.  \nMoss and black mold consumed the walls.  \nThe sink cabinet was rotting. The pipes leaked dark, rusty liquid and so did the faucet.  \nA putrid stench filled the air and made me gag, my eyes watering with the foul odor.  \nThen, I wiped my eyes and I could see again—I saw her.\n\n*“Hi, love.”*  \nMy wife sat on the toilet. Her clothes torn and filthy.\n\nShe was hunched over, cradling a dark, bloody mass in her hands.  \nShe stared at it as blood dripped between her fingers.  \nIt was moving, turning on her skinny palms.\n\n*“I should be happy, shouldn’t I?”* she whimpered.\n\nHer body was in ruins.  \nBones showing under pale, dried skin.  \nHer delicate hands now skeletal, soaked in blood.  \nHer eyes—black, sunken, ringed in purple.  \nMy Amy… what the hell happened?\n\n*“Amy, what… what is that?”* I asked, barely keeping calm.  \nMy heart pounded. My brain couldn’t process.\n\n*“He has his father’s eyes, doesn’t he?”*  \nShe stared at the grotesque thing in her hands.\n\n\"Well, you know what they say about closed doors!\" She looked at me with a crooked smile. The door slamed shut behind me.\n\nBefore I could react, Amy slowly tilted her head forward—  \nAnd sank her rotting teeth into the bloody flesh.\n\nThen, I woke up."},"66":{"title":"There's a man who stands on the abandoned roof across from my window every night watching the sky. No one else can see him, and I think I just made him notice me.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1keq48h\/theres_a_man_who_stands_on_the_abandoned_roof\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"gamalfrank","selftext":"I don’t really know  how to phrase it. This thing has been unsettling me, terrifying me, for a while now, and I can’t keep it bottled up anymore. I live alone in an apartment in, well… let’s just say an older part of town, a bit run-down maybe. I won't say exactly where because of the rules here, and frankly, because I'm already scared enough. My apartment is on the third floor. My balcony and my bedroom window look out over the street and directly at an old, abandoned house on the other side. It's been sealed up for years; nobody goes in, nobody comes out. The windows are broken, the main door is padlocked shut, and the whole place just radiates decay.\n\nThis whole thing started about… maybe three or four months ago. Like usual, I was staying up a bit late on the balcony, maybe having a smoke or a cup of tea before heading to bed. One night, I noticed a silhouette standing on the roof of that abandoned house. At first, I didn't process it, couldn't quite make it out. It was pretty dark, but the streetlights cast enough illumination over the area. I focused a little harder… No, that was definitely a person. A man, standing there.\n\nI was immediately confused. This house is locked up tight; no one ever goes near it. Who would be climbing onto its roof? And how? My first thought was maybe it was just some local kids messing around. But this man was standing perfectly still. Not moving at all. And stranger still… he was looking up. At the sky. His head was tilted back as if he were stargazing or… or I honestly don’t know what he was doing.\n\nI watched him for about five minutes. He didn't budge. Stood there like a statue, gazing upwards. He looked completely ordinary, by the way. Wearing normal clothes – pants and a shirt or t-shirt, hard to tell exactly from the distance and in the dim light. His build was average, not particularly large or thin. But what was strange and unsettling, apart from his presence there, was that I couldn't see his face at all. His head was tilted back at such an angle that no matter how I tried, I could only maybe make out his chin and the back of his hair.\n\nI felt a little uneasy, went inside, locked the balcony door, and went to sleep. The next day, I’d mostly forgotten about it. Until that night. Around the same time, I stepped out onto the balcony… and there he was. Standing in the exact same spot, in the exact same pose, looking up at the sky. This time, I felt a genuine sense of dread. Who was this? What was he doing every night on the roof of a locked, abandoned house? And why did he just keep staring at the sky like that?\n\nI didn’t sleep well that night. My mind kept racing. Maybe a burglar scouting the area? But there’s nothing to steal in that ruin. Maybe someone mentally unwell? Maybe someone… I didn’t know. The next morning, on my way to work, I made a point of looking closely at the abandoned house. No sign of anyone. The door was still padlocked; the windows were still broken. No indication that anyone had been coming or going.\n\nThis became a pattern. Every single night. The same man, the same spot on the roof, the same posture, looking up at the sky. He never missed a night. He became a part of my nightly routine, a deeply unsettling part. Sometimes I’d go out onto the balcony specifically to see if he was there. Other times, I’d avoid the balcony altogether, staying in my room, terrified to even glance out the window and find him standing there.\n\nI started to feel real anxiety. This wasn't normal. I began asking around the neighborhood, subtly. I went down to talk to Mr. Henderson, the superintendent of my building, an older guy who’s lived in the area forever.\n\n“Hey, Mr. Henderson, can I ask you something?”\n\n“Sure thing. What’s up?”\n\n“That abandoned house across the street… does anyone ever go up on its roof at night?”\n\nMr. Henderson looked at me like I had two heads. \n\n“The roof? What roof? That place is a wreck, son. Been boarded up for more than twenty years. Nobody can get up on that roof anyway. The inside staircase collapsed years ago.”\n\n“Are you sure, Mr. Henderson? Because I thought I…” \n\nI trailed off. What was I going to say? That I see a guy standing there looking at the sky every night? He’d think I was crazy.\n\n“Positive. I’ve been here long before you moved in. Nobody goes near that house.”\n\nI just said okay, thanked him, and went back upstairs feeling like something was seriously wrong. Either Mr. Henderson wasn't paying attention, or… or I was hallucinating.\n\nI went to the small convenience store down the block. Asked the guy behind the counter the same question, but indirectly.\n\n“What’s the story with that boarded-up house, anyway? Looks kind of creepy.”\n\n“Oh, that was old Mr. Abernathy’s place… died, him and his wife, in an accident years back. Kids sold it to someone who just let it sit, then they moved away. Place is probably haunted” \n\nhe said that last part with a little smirk.\n\n“Haunted? Haunted by what?”\n\n“Ghosts, spirits… you know, local talk. Point is, nobody goes near it after dark.”\n\n“Right… Have you ever seen anyone strange hanging around it? Maybe lurking nearby? Or… on the roof, maybe?”\n\nThe shopkeeper laughed. \n\n“The roof? Who’d be able to get up there? Nah, nobody goes near it. You seen something?”\n\nI felt like if I told him, he’d either laugh at me or get spooked. I just said,\n\n “No, no, just asking. It looks weird.”\n\n And I left.\n\nI sat with myself, thinking. Nobody sees him but me? How is that possible? Am I imagining it? But I see him so clearly every night. Standing right there. A physical presence. So why doesn’t anyone else see him? Does he only appear to me? Why?\n\nThese questions started eating away at me. I wasn't sleeping properly anymore. I was constantly anxious and tense. Every time evening approached, my heart would start beating faster. I’d approach the window hesitantly. Look out cautiously… and find him. Standing in his spot. Looking at the sky.\n\nI started observing him more intently. Trying to notice any detail. His clothes were almost always the same. His posture never changed. He never moved at all. Like a mannequin placed up there. Sometimes I’d stare at him for hours, waiting for any movement, any change. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. But the feeling of anxiety and suspicion grew stronger inside me. There was something fundamentally wrong about this man, about his stance, and about the fact that nobody else seemed to see him.\n\nAnother month passed like this. I was nearing a nervous breakdown. I felt like I was officially losing my mind. I considered seeing a therapist. But I was scared. Scared they’d lock me up or put me on medication that would numb me. More importantly, I had this gut feeling that this was real. Not delusions. Something was happening, and I was the only one witnessing it.\n\nI started considering wild explanations. Was he a ghost? Some kind of spirit? But if so, why just stand there looking at the sky? The ghosts and spirits you hear about usually try to scare people, harm them, make noises. This figure was completely silent, seemingly peaceful. But his very existence had become terrifying to me. Terrifying because of the mystery surrounding him, and because of the feeling that I was the only person on Earth who could see him.\n\nThat sense of isolation was crushing. Like there was a secret between me and this entity, a secret nobody else in the world knew. Did he know I was watching? No, impossible. He was always looking up. He never once looked towards me or anywhere else. His entire focus was on the sky.\n\nLast night… the moon was incredibly bright. A full moon, lighting up the street almost like daylight. I went out onto the balcony, tense as usual. And I looked towards the abandoned house. There he was. Standing in his spot. The moonlight revealed him more clearly than ever before. I could see more details in his clothes. Dark jeans and a plain white t-shirt. His hair seemed dark, maybe a bit thick. But his face… still couldn't see it. Head tilted sharply upwards.\n\nIn that moment, I don’t know what came over me. Maybe it was desperation, maybe temporary insanity, maybe just the overwhelming need to break this stalemate and find out the truth. I found myself looking around the balcony. There were a few loose bricks and stones piled in a corner, left over from some old building repairs nobody ever cleared away.\n\nThe demon of curiosity, or maybe madness, whispered to me. If I threw something near him… would he look? Would he move? Would I finally know if he was real and not just a figment of my stressed-out mind? But then, if he was real and nobody else could see him, that was an even bigger problem. But I wasn’t thinking logically anymore. I just wanted any reaction. Any proof.\n\nI bent down, picked up a smallish stone, about the size of my fist. My heart was pounding like a drum against my ribs. My hand was shaking. I looked at him again. Still standing there, looking at the sky, lost in his celestial contemplation.\n\nI took a deep breath, raised my arm… and threw the stone. I wasn’t trying to hit him, of course. I aimed it so it would land on the roof beside him. Just to make a sound, hoping he’d turn.\n\nI watched the stone arc through the moonlit air, like it was moving in slow motion. It landed with a soft thud on the rooftop of the abandoned house, maybe a yard or two away from where he stood.\n\nIn that instant… everything stopped. The ambient sounds of the street faded from my ears. The breath caught in my chest. My entire focus locked onto him.\n\nFor the first time in months… he moved.\n\nBut he didn’t move the way I expected. He didn’t quickly lower his head to investigate the source of the sound. No. His head lowered with agonizing slowness. A terrifying, unnatural slowness. Like the neck of a machine turning on rusty gears. Degree by degree… centimeter by centimeter… his head descended and began to turn towards me. Towards my balcony.\n\nMy heart felt like it was going to stop. I wanted to scream and run and hide, but my body was frozen in place. I couldn’t move, couldn’t tear my eyes away from him.\n\nHis head completed its turn until it was facing me directly. And for the first time in months… I saw his face. Or what should have been his face.\n\nIn the shadows beneath his previously raised head, there weren't distinct features. But there was something else. Something that made my blood run cold and my knees buckle.\n\nHis eyes.\n\nHis eyes were glowing.\n\nNot just reflecting the moonlight. No. They were emitting a strong, white light. Like two small, intense flashlights aimed directly at me. A cold, terrifying light, devoid of any life or expression. Just pure white light pouring out from where his eyes should be.\n\nThe moment my gaze met his… or met the light emanating from his eyes… I felt an electric shock surge through my entire body. Raw, primal terror, unlike anything I had ever known. A feeling that this entity wasn’t just strange or mysterious… it was dangerous. Extremely dangerous.\n\nI don’t know how my legs carried me. I found myself scrambling back into the apartment like a madman, slamming the balcony door shut, rattling down the blinds, pulling the curtains closed. I ran to the front door, checked that it was securely locked. I went around to every window in the apartment, shutting them, closing all the curtains. I was breathing heavily, my heartbeat echoing in my ears. Sweat drenched me, and I was trembling like a leaf.\n\nI ended up sitting in the middle of the dark living room, hugging my knees to my chest, shaking uncontrollably. My mind couldn’t process what I had seen. Those glowing eyes… that wasn't human. That wasn't natural. That was something else entirely. Something I had been watching for months, thinking it was unaware… or I hoped it was unaware.\n\nAfter some time, I don’t know how long, maybe an hour or more, with fear completely paralyzing me, I started to calm down just a little. But the terror didn't leave. I decided I had to look again. I had to know if he was still there or if he’d left. Maybe what I saw was a hallucination brought on by extreme fear and stress?\n\nI crept towards my bedroom window with extreme caution. I opened a tiny sliver of the curtain, just enough to see out without being seen. My heart started hammering again. I looked towards the roof of the abandoned house…\n\nNobody.\n\nThe roof was empty. The spot where he always stood showed no trace of him.\n\nI felt a momentary wave of relief… immediately followed by a much larger wave of dread. Where did he go? Did he vanish? Did he come down? But how could he come down when the house was sealed?\n\nMy eyes scanned the area around the abandoned house… and suddenly… I caught movement.\n\nNot on the roof of the abandoned house. No.\n\nOn the roof of the building next door to mine. My neighbor's building, in the same row as my apartment block. Much, much closer.\n\nMy stomach dropped.\n\nIt was him. The same man. The same clothes. Standing with the same stillness. But this time… he wasn't looking at the sky.\n\nHe was looking directly at me.\n\nStanding on my neighbor's roof, which is practically adjacent to my building, his face turned directly towards my apartment window. And his eyes… they were still glowing with that same cold, terrifying white light. As if he knew exactly where I was peering from behind the curtain. As if he was saying:\n\n \"I saw you. And I know you see me. And I know where you are.\"\n\nI yanked the curtain shut instantly and stumbled backward, feeling nauseous. The terror I felt in that moment was exponentially worse than the initial fear. Before, he was a distant, mysterious entity. Now, he was a terrifying entity, close by, aware of my existence, and aware of my location.\n\nIt's my fault. I'm the one who drew his attention. With my stupid, impulsive action, throwing that stone, I made him look at me, made him discover me. He was just standing there, minding his own business, looking at the sky, and nobody noticed him but me, and like an idiot, I was watching him. Now he's the one watching back. But his gaze says it's not just watching.\n\nI've been holed up in my apartment for two days now. I don't open windows or the balcony door. All the curtains are drawn. I'm afraid to even get close to any opening to the outside world. I ordered food delivery and opened the door terrified, peering frantically down the hallway. I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see that white light pouring from his eyes, staring at me.\n\nI can feel him. I feel like he's still out there. Standing on the neighbors' roof, waiting for me to make a mistake and open a curtain, waiting for me to show myself. I feel his gaze penetrating the walls.\n\nI don't know what to do. Call the police? Tell them what? There's a guy with glowing eyes standing on my neighbor's roof staring at me? They'll think I'm on drugs or certifiably insane. Who can I tell? Who would believe me?\n\nI wrote all this down here because I feel like I'll go crazy if I keep it inside. Maybe someone here has gone through something similar? Maybe someone knows what this could be? Any explanation? Any advice?\n\nI'm so scared. Scared of what comes next. Scared that he won't just keep standing there looking. I feel like this was just the beginning. And that what I did opened a door I'm not remotely prepared to deal with.\n\nI think I hear faint footsteps on the stairs outside my apartment door right now… No, no, I must be imagining it… There's nothing there… right?\n\nI have to go now. I need to turn off the lights and stay quiet. Please, God, help me."},"67":{"title":"The Whisper in the ChacoGran Chaco","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kf2znh\/the_whisper_in_the_chacogran_chaco\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"RevSquatchFultz","selftext":" Chaco, Paraguay – March 1995The Gran Chaco forest near the Mennonite village of Filadelfia was a labyrinth of thorny scrub, towering quebracho trees, and tangled vines, its dense canopy casting long shadows as the sun dipped low on a humid March evening. Mateo Gonzalez, a 34-year-old farmer, adjusted the machete on his belt as he walked the narrow trail toward his cassava field, his boots kicking up dust from the dry earth. Beside him, his 12-year-old daughter, Clara, carried a woven basket, her dark eyes flickering nervously toward the underbrush. The village had been on edge for weeks—chickens had gone missing, strange whistling sounds echoed at night, and small, child-sized footprints were found near the river. The elders whispered one word: Pombero.“Papa, can we go back?” Clara asked, her voice trembling as she clutched the basket tighter. “Abuela said the Pombero comes out when the sun goes down.”Mateo forced a reassuring smile, though his grip on the machete tightened. “Don’t worry, mi hija. Those are just old stories. We’ll dig up some cassava and be home before dark.” Growing up in Filadelfia, a remote Mennonite colony in Paraguay’s Chaco, Mateo had heard the tales countless times: the Pombero, a hairy little creature no taller than a child, with glowing eyes and a mischievous streak that could turn deadly. The Guarani people, who’d lived in the region long before the Mennonites arrived, spoke of it as a forest spirit, one that stole food, spooked livestock, and sometimes took people who wandered too far from home. Villagers left offerings of tobacco or honey to appease it, but Mateo, a practical man who spent his days tending crops and cattle, had always dismissed the stories as superstition. Still, the eerie quiet of the forest tonight made his stomach churn.They reached the cassava field, a small clearing carved out of the forest, where the plants grew in uneven rows. Mateo knelt to dig up a root with a small wooden spade, his machete resting beside him, while Clara gathered the tubers into her basket. In 1995, Filadelfia was a simple place—no electricity in most homes, no radios blaring news of the outside world, just the rhythm of farm life and the ever-present hum of the Chaco’s insects. But as the last light of day faded, that hum fell silent, replaced by an oppressive stillness that pressed down on them like a weight.Clara froze, her small hands trembling as she dropped a cassava root. “Papa, do you hear that?” she whispered.Mateo stood, wiping sweat from his brow, and listened. A faint rustling came from the trees, followed by a low, guttural whistle—a sound no animal he knew could make. His heart pounded. “Stay close to me,” he said, grabbing his machete and pulling Clara behind him. The rustling grew louder, circling the clearing, and then he saw it: a pair of glowing yellow eyes peering from the underbrush, no more than 3 feet off the ground. The eyes belonged to a small, humanoid figure, its body covered in dark, matted fur, its hands ending in sharp, claw-like nails. The Pombero. It stepped into the clearing, its movements quick and jerky, like a predator stalking prey. Mateo’s blood ran cold. The creature matched the stories perfectly—small, about Clara’s height, but its presence was menacing, its glowing eyes fixed on his daughter with an unnerving intensity. It let out another whistle, sharp and threatening, and took a step closer, baring a mouth full of jagged fangs. Clara whimpered, clinging to Mateo’s leg, as he raised his machete. “Stay back!” he shouted, his voice cracking with fear. The Pombero lunged, moving with a speed that belied its size, and Mateo swung his machete, the blade slicing through the air. The creature dodged with ease, its small frame darting to the side, and swiped at Mateo’s leg with its claws, tearing through his cotton pants and drawing a thin line of blood. Mateo grunted in pain, his leg burning, but he held his ground, shielding Clara as the Pombero circled them, its whistles growing more aggressive. He knew they couldn’t outrun it—the stories said the Pombero was faster than any man, even in the dense Chaco forest, where thorny branches and hidden roots made every step treacherous. Just as the creature coiled to strike again, a deafening roar erupted from the trees, a deep, primal sound that shook the ground beneath their feet. The Pombero froze, its glowing eyes darting toward the noise, and Mateo and Clara turned to see a massive figure emerge from the forest’s edge. It stood over 8 feet tall, a towering mass of shaggy brown hair, its long arms rippling with muscle, its broad chest heaving with each breath. Its face was human-like, with deep-set eyes that burned with fierce determination, framed by a heavy brow and a wild mane of hair. Mateo’s breath caught in his throat. A Sasquatch—a creature he’d only heard of in passing from travelers who spoke of North American legends, something he’d never imagined seeing in the Chaco.The Sasquatch roared again, baring its teeth, and charged at the Pombero with earth-shaking strides. The smaller creature hissed, its claws slashing at the air, but the Sasquatch was stronger. It grabbed the Pombero by its furry neck, lifting it off the ground as if it weighed nothing, and hurled it into the trees with a sickening thud. The Pombero let out a shrill, haunting cry that echoed through the forest, then scrambled into the underbrush, its glowing eyes vanishing into the darkness as it fled.The Sasquatch stood at the edge of the clearing, its massive frame silhouetted against the twilight, breathing heavily. It turned to Mateo and Clara, its deep eyes meeting theirs for a brief moment. Mateo saw something in that gaze—intelligence, perhaps even a flicker of protectiveness—before the creature let out a low grunt and turned back to the forest, disappearing into the shadows with heavy, deliberate steps that faded into silence.Mateo dropped his machete, his hands trembling as he pulled Clara into his arms. “It’s okay, mi hija,” he whispered, though his voice shook. “We’re safe now.” Clara sobbed into his chest, her small body trembling, as Mateo’s mind raced. Two myths in one night—the Pombero, a creature he’d dismissed as folklore, and a Sasquatch, something he’d never even dreamed of encountering in Paraguay. He didn’t understand how or why the larger creature had intervened, but he was grateful beyond words.They gathered their basket, leaving half the cassava behind in their haste, and stumbled back to the village, the forest eerily quiet behind them. The trail felt longer than ever, every rustle making Mateo’s heart jump, but they reached their small wooden house just as the first stars appeared in the sky. Inside, Mateo’s mother, Ana, was waiting by the kerosene lamp, her weathered face etched with worry. When she saw the blood on Mateo’s leg and the terror in their eyes, she didn’t need to ask what had happened. “The Pombero,” she said softly, her voice heavy with knowing. Mateo nodded, recounting the encounter—the creature’s glowing eyes, its speed, its malice—and the Sasquatch that had driven it away.Ana listened in silence, then crossed herself. “The Pombero is real, Mateo. It’s been here longer than any of us. But the forest has its guardians, too. You’re lucky one was watching over you.” She handed him a small bundle of tobacco leaves, a traditional offering. “Put this at the edge of the forest tonight. Thank the guardian—and pray the Pombero stays away.”That night, Mateo did as his mother instructed, placing the tobacco at the forest’s edge under the flickering light of a kerosene lantern. He whispered a quiet prayer of gratitude, not just to the Sasquatch, but to whatever forces had spared him and Clara. From that day on, he never scoffed at the old stories again, and he made sure Clara knew the importance of the offerings—a lesson he wished he’d heeded sooner."},"68":{"title":"Looking for a story","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kf04br\/looking_for_a_story\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"No_Cartoonist964","selftext":"I’ve been looking for this story and I’m not sure what it’s called.

I found a little internet café so we are good to go! \n\nHis prying words led to the next interaction with my childhood nightmares. And honestly, as sad as I may sound, I'm still relieved to be done with those therapy sessions. \n\nOur final session came just 3 days after my 17th birthday. I was feeling disgusted with the way my life was playing out in front of me like a terrible movie in a theater that I hadn't asked to attend. I quite frankly had come to a crossroads in my life. If he was going to pry to open the door, then I was going to kick that door open for him and lay it all out on the coffee table of his expensive office. \n\nI began laying out every intricate detail of my childhood and all the fucked up things that I had been subjected to. \n\n\"Well... I am sorry that you have lived through so much trauma, Jake. It's very obvious you have lived through as much as 10 others,\" he said in what felt like mocking sympathy. \n\n\"So did they ever find the person who murdered your mother?\" he pressed. \n\n\"Mick killed my mother,\" I responded bitterly. \n\nLetting out a sigh before responding, he said, \"Mick is a fabrication of your mind, Jake. He is a safety blanket that your subconscious mind developed to help shield you from the scary things as a kid.\" \n\nHis words poured gasoline on an already burning ember from deep within my mind. I felt the venom burn the tip of my tongue as I laid into him with hate-fueled rage. \n\n\"Safety blanket? A FUCKING SAFETY BLANKET? THAT GODFORSAKEN MONSTER KILLED MY PARENTS! He stole every single drop of innocence from my childhood! He MURDERED MY MOTHER, he ate her fucking tongue and slashed her throat open. He MURDERED my father and ATE HIS FUCKING HANDS.\" I noticed little bits of spit flying through the air on the back of my bitter words. \n\nThe look I was given in return to my onslaught proved to jolt me back into this realm. I let out a large breath before collecting myself and saying, \"He murdered....me.\" \n\nHanding me a wad of tissue to soak up the trail of tears I hadn't noticed falling from my chin, he fixed his tie nervously before saying, \"Jake, I'm sorry to upset you like this, but you need to know this is how the heart and mind heal. There are many ways of coping with distress, and the mind will always choose one way or another to heal.\" \n\nHis manufactured words carried with them only more fuel to piss me off. I felt as though I finally gave him what he was asking for the past several years and I was brushed aside. \n\n\"Today was a great step in the right direction, but I think it's time to be aggressively honest, Jake. It's time you step out of the realm of make-believe and live here with all of the rest of us in the real world.\" \n\n\"Sure.... maybe next time,\" I said before standing from the chair and turning towards the door. Just as my hand wrapped around the handle, I heard those sharp words crawl up my spine and into my ears. \"Hiya JJ, long time no see.\" \n\nMy world was filled with more emotions than I can describe. I felt fear creep across the back of my neck as the hair stood at attention. My fight or flight instincts kicked in, and I was prepared for flight. \n\n\"Hey, you can't be in here! These sessions are private. You need to leave or I'll call security,\" my therapist muttered in fear and disbelief at the image standing there between us. \n\nLetting out a shaking breath, I turned around and met eyes with my walking nightmare. There, about 5 feet to the right on my chair, stood Mick. \n\nThis time Mick's body was bigger and more bloated than before. Large deep scarring stretch marks were bulging across his skin like lines on a map. The once vibrant-looking skin was waxy and pale. His charred childhood clothing hardly clung to life over his disgusting bloated body. \n\nMy eyes rose to his facial features. His endless rows of teeth were there as always. I recall staring at them and thinking about how those had been the same teeth that brought horrid ends to my parents. \n\n\"What the fuck are you doing here, Mick?\" I asked, trying to hide my shaking bones. \n\n\"Oh, you know... just out for a bite,\" he hissed between his clenched teeth stuck in a sharp wide smile. \n\n\"Mick?\" asked my therapist while peering at me in horror before jumping to his feet and fleeing for the door. \n\nI watched as Mick's eyes flicked from the glassy grey to bright red. The light in the room was sapped from my eyes as I felt a liquid warmth wash over my face and arms. \n\nMick had attacked the poor man with unbelievable speed, and to this day, I'm thankful that at the very least it was instant. \n\nThis was the first time I had witnessed in first person the cruel depravity of my once best friend. The pure lack of all humanity struck my brain like lightning and shoved me into a state of confusion followed by immense fear. \n\nI lifted my shirt and smeared my eyes clear. The sounds of my slamming heartbeat boomed through my eardrums, and the feeling of swallowing a 50 lb weight hit the bottom of my stomach in step. \n\nMick's eyes flicked once again from hellfire red to sluggish grey. He raised his finger out in front of his chewing mouth as to tell me to be quiet and then vanished in an instant, leaving behind him only the partially scorched floorboards where his feet had been planted. \n\nWhile his physical image had left the now stained office, the image of his disgusting figure never left my mind. \n\nHaving heard the commotion, the secretary rushed into the room, almost knocking me over in the process, and screaming so loud you would have thought she tore her vocal cords. \n\nI just stood there in shock staring at the crater in the top of the poor man's head. \n\nAccording to the police report, an unknown assailant had entered the therapy center and attacked the unsuspecting therapist mid-session before making an unexplainable escape from the scene, and I never even attempted to correct them. \n\nI was of course taken into custody by the police. They made sure to rough me up and interrogate the hell out of me. Given my long list of petty crimes and run-ins with the law in the past, they made the assumption that I was involved, and honestly, they were correct.... just not in the way they would ever believe. \n\nMy saving grace came when the security camera footage was reviewed. They never let me see it, and honestly, I was relieved. The last thing I wanted to do was watch that horrible act again. Watching it in person, feeling the warm innards of another human being splattered across my face and facing the horrid reality of someone's demise stuck with me more than anything else. \n\nThe most chilling part was reading the autopsy report. I swiped it off the desk of a detective that was interviewing me. Reading the report, I found that his brain had been missing....missing, not damaged beyond recognition but gone. Mick had smashed the poor man's skull open like a fucking coconut and siphoned his brain from its resting spot. The words dug the pit in my stomach to an even deeper level. \n\nAfter the police investigation ruled me out as a suspect, I began attempting to reach out to Stan again. My attempts in earlier years had been fruitless. Stan had obviously bounced from place to place after leaving home with nothing more than the shirt on his back and the musty smell of cigarettes and dirt clinging to his hair. \n\nI dreamed about my brother and where he may be all the time. I recall having fantastic dreams as a child that he was off somewhere living out the childish dreams we once fantasized about. Maybe he was riding elephants in the jungle looking for treasure, or maybe he had joined a ragtag group of mercenaries in a distant land fighting to free the local people from their oppressive overlords. The imagination of a child never runs out of space no matter the box life may put around it. \n\nAs I grew older into my later teenage years, I started daydreaming things much more realistic. I hoped that Stan was alive. I dreamed that he may have found a safe place to live and maybe settled down somewhere with a nice girl. I hoped with every part of my being that he made it out of the deep swampy woods we lived in. \n\nI found Stan hardly living what one would call a life. He was holed up in a crack den on the south side of the city. He was sharing the 3rd bedroom of a partially burned out house with 2 other drug-riddled human beings. \n\nLarge groups of track marks sprawled across the now brown veins on his emaciated arms. His teeth had almost rotted completely from his mouth. His once childish features now replaced with rapidly aged creases and scars. \n\nI tried like hell to save my brother. I tried with all that I had to stop his addictions. I tried to talk him down off of that dark balcony floating above the world, but I failed. \n\nThe hard-learned lessons of my life continued, and this lesson taught me that you can't save someone that doesn't want to be saved....no matter how much you love them, no matter how much you need them. \n\nStan succumbed to his addictions only 4 short months after I found him. He was on a heroin-fueled bender somewhere on the west side when he took a fall from a 6th story window. Crashing through the fire escape floor before landing on the sidewalk lifeless. \n\nHis funeral, if you could call it a funeral, consisted of 3 people. Me, a priest, and my dead brother. I took his urn to the church and held it while the priest said a few prayers over him. \n\nI thought of taking his ashes to the very swamp that we used to play together in as children, but how cruel would that have been? Stan fought for his life to leave that place, and it was in no way my right to return him there. \n\nThe next few years of my life whisked away in a blink. Each day as forgettable as the next. I fought my demons alone at night when I laid my head on my pillow. I would stare at my stained walls and watch the horrible events of the past play out once again in my mind. \n\nI found a meaningless job in a dumpy little corner store as a cook. The job itself was easy enough. Unwrapping frozen processed food and throwing it in an industrial oven doesn't take much skill. \n\nI contemplated leaving all the time but found that I had nowhere to go if I had. The small checks I earned were enough to pay for a room in a shared apartment a few blocks away. \n\nI lived that menial life for a while before my most recent meeting with Mick and the reason I'm writing this now. \n\nMick came to visit last week. He first appeared across the street from my job standing at the bus stop. I felt every hair on my body raise, and it felt as though they were on fire. \n\nHe was somehow even more disfigured and bloated than previously. His large bulging stomach hung down below his waist. What little was left of his disgusting greasy blonde hair spilled down over his scarred body. \n\nThe clothing he wore from my childhood had long since tattered and fallen from his body, now replaced by disfiguring scars and oozing wounds. \n\nHe was almost completely unrecognizable to his old image. Save for his demonic smile. \n\nI continued seeing Mick in every aspect of my life. I would see him in a window of a second story building while I made my way home, or I would catch a glimpse of his disgusting figure in the hallway of my apartment building. \n\nI begged whatever God would listen to free me from him. I said a prayer I wished would be answered. I fear that wish was heard but not by those I wished to hear it. \n\nThat brings us to last night. \n\nMick showed up in my room to have one last chat. \n\nI was resting my eyes trying to listen to the soft sounds of rain lightly tapping across the windowsill of my room when I heard his heavy breathing. \n\nStricken with fear, I found my mind and body fighting against each other, one trying to face the intruder and the other seeking to hold perfectly still. \n\nThe smell of something burnt and rotting hung thick in the air like a dense fog. I found the scent carried with it a gross sweet taste that stuck to the roof of my mouth. \n\nMick let out a small hissing gurgle before speaking to me in what sounded nothing like his old voice. He sounded as though he was struggling to breathe. \"Heya JJ, I know you're awake....I know everything.\" \n\nHis words shot lightning out the ends of my feet and hands. The overwhelming fear struck my heart like a hammer. I finally turned to face him standing in the corner of my small room. \n\nMick continued, \"I know that your mother couldn't keep her words to herself, so I took them from her.\" \n\n\"I know your father couldn't keep his hands to himself, so I took them from him too,\" he smiled slightly and allowed his black tongue to slide across his rotting teeth. \n\n\"I know that you should thank me for ending the thoughts of that annoying therapist of yours!\" He laughed at his own words. \n\n\"I also know that your brother always wanted to fly high,\" letting out a small gurgling crackle before continuing. \n\n\"And I gave him his wish.\" \n\nMick shuffled his horrid form closer to my bed and leaned over the footboard, staining my sheets a dark moldy color with his scorched skin. \n\n\"But ya know what?....there's one thing I don't know yet, JJ,\" his smile stretched to an impossibly wide size exposing both sets of his razor-sharp teeth. The rancid breath that oozed out hit me like a rotten corpse. \n\nStaring down the dark pit of his throat, I watched as he spoke, \"I don't know what YOU taste like yet.\" \n\nJust as his eyes flashed to that hellfire red color, my roommate came barreling in my door and flipped on the light. \n\nMick was gone in an instant, leaving nothing more than the stench of decay and the stains on my bed. \n\n\"What the fuck was that thing? I'm..I'm gonna call the cops!\" he said while turning and running for his room. \n\nI made my break for it. I grabbed what little would fit in my bag and darted for the apartment door. \n\nCatching a cab to downtown, I ended up at this little internet café on Main. I am borrowing one of their public use laptops, and I have been sitting here writing this out all night. \n\nI just don't know what to do. I tried researching how to fight this. I tried other forums. Hell, I even called the priest that led Stan's service, but he wouldn't pick up. \n\nI can see Mick across the square sitting on a park bench waiting for me. The worker has told me twice now that I need to finish up what I am doing because they are closing. \n\nSoon I will have to leave the café and walk out into the dark rainy streets to play once again...with my very best friend Mick."},"70":{"title":"The Ledger","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kf3980\/the_ledger\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"RevSquatchFultz","selftext":"Short Story: The Ledger of the Fallen Olympic National Forest, Washington – April 2025 The rain fell in a steady drizzle over the Olympic National Forest, soaking the mossy undergrowth and turning the trails into slick mud. Park Ranger Michael Evans, a 38-year-old former Marine with a grizzled beard and a limp from an old injury, sat in his cabin near Lake Quinault, a kerosene lamp casting a warm glow over the small room. It was late, the kind of night where the forest seemed to hold its breath, and Michael was sorting through a box of old records he’d found in the ranger station’s attic—documents dating back to the early days of the park, some as old as the late 18th century. He’d always been a history buff, and the idea of uncovering forgotten stories from the Pacific Northwest was a welcome distraction from the solitude of his post. One leather-bound ledger caught his eye, its pages yellowed and brittle, the ink faded but legible. The date on the cover read 1799, and the title, scrawled in a shaky hand, was simply An Account of the Darkness in the Woods. Intrigued, Michael opened it, the pages crackling as he turned them. The story was written by a man named Elias Whitmore, a fur trapper who’d roamed the region when it was still untamed wilderness. As Michael read, a chill ran down his spine, not from the cold, but from the tale unfolding before him—a tale of a preacher, a fallen angel, and a battle that defied belief.The Olympic Peninsula, Washington Territory – September 1799Elias Whitmore’s hands trembled as he set his quill to paper, the flickering light of his campfire casting shadows on the walls of his tent. He was a trapper, 32 years old, hardened by years of braving the wilderness in search of beaver pelts and bear hides. But tonight, he’d seen something that would haunt him for the rest of his days, and he felt compelled to record it, if only to make sense of the terror and the miracle that had saved him.I had made camp near the banks of the Quinault River, Elias wrote, my traps set and my fire burning low. The night was clear, the stars bright above the towering pines, but a strange unease gripped me. The forest was too quiet—no wolves howling, no owls calling. Then I heard it—a sound like the beating of great wings, followed by a voice that seemed to come from the air itself, cold and cruel, speaking words I could not understand.Elias looked up from his writing, his memory vivid as he relived the moment. A shadow had fallen over his camp, and from the darkness emerged a figure that could only be described as a fallen angel. It stood 8 feet tall, its once-glorious wings now tattered and blackened, their feathers dripping with an inky ichor. Its body was humanoid but gaunt, its skin a sickly gray, and its eyes burned with a crimson fire that spoke of endless malice. In its hand, it held a jagged sword of obsidian, the blade pulsing with an unholy light. “Mortal,” it hissed, its voice a venomous whisper, “I am Malachor, cast out from the heavens for my rebellion. This land is mine now, and your soul will be my offering.”Elias scrambled for his musket, his hands slick with sweat, but before he could fire, Malachor swept forward, its wings unfurling with a gust that extinguished the campfire. The fallen angel’s sword slashed through the air, slicing Elias’s musket in two, and a clawed hand seized him by the throat, lifting him off the ground. “Your kind is weak,” Malachor sneered, its crimson eyes boring into him. “You will be the first of many to fall.” Elias choked, his vision darkening, as the fallen angel’s grip tightened, the cold of its touch seeping into his bones.But then, a voice rang out, strong and unwavering, cutting through the darkness like a beacon. “Release him, servant of the pit!” A man strode into the clearing, a tall figure in a simple black coat, his face weathered but resolute, a wooden cross hanging around his neck. He was in his late 30s, with a dark beard and eyes that shone with a fierce, unshakable faith. In his hand, he held a leather-bound Bible, its pages worn from years of use.Malachor turned, its wings flaring, and let out a snarl that shook the trees. “Who dares challenge me?” it roared, dropping Elias to the ground. Elias gasped for air, crawling behind a fallen log as the man stepped forward, unafraid.“I am Reverend Nathaniel Stone, servant of the Most High,” the preacher declared, his voice steady as iron. “Your rebellion ends here, Malachor.” The fallen angel laughed, a sound like breaking glass, and lunged, its obsidian sword aimed for Nathaniel’s heart. But the preacher moved with a speed and strength that defied nature, catching the blade between his hands as if it were a child’s toy. The sword pulsed, its unholy energy crackling against Nathaniel’s skin, but he held firm, his muscles straining as he twisted the blade from Malachor’s grasp and snapped it in two with a force that seemed beyond human.Malachor screeched, its wings beating furiously as it clawed at Nathaniel, its talons raking at his coat. But the preacher was undeterred. “By the power of the Almighty, I cast you out!” he shouted, grabbing the fallen angel by its throat with one hand, his grip like a vice. Malachor thrashed, its ichor-soaked wings flailing, but Nathaniel’s strength was unyielding. He slammed the creature to the ground, pinning it with a knee, and pressed his Bible to its chest. “Return to the abyss from whence you came!” he commanded, his voice rising in a fervent prayer.A blinding light erupted from the Bible, engulfing Malachor in a radiance that burned away its darkness. The fallen angel let out a final, anguished scream, its body dissolving into ash and smoke, leaving behind a scorched patch of earth. The forest fell silent, the stars reappearing as if the heavens themselves sighed in relief.Nathaniel turned to Elias, who was still trembling behind the log, and offered a calloused hand. “You’re safe now, friend,” he said, his voice softening. “The Lord watches over His own, even in the wild places.” Elias took his hand, his fear giving way to awe. “Who are you?” he asked, his voice hoarse.“Reverend Nathaniel Stone,” the preacher replied, his eyes warm despite the battle he’d just fought. “I roam these lands, bringin’ the Word to those who need it—and fightin’ the darkness when it rises. That creature was a fallen angel, cast out for defyin’ the Creator. But the Lord’s strength flows through me, and I’ll not let such evil take root.” He helped Elias to his feet, then turned to leave, his black coat blending into the night. “Keep the faith, friend,” he called over his shoulder, before disappearing into the forest.Elias sat by the rekindled fire, his hands still shaking as he wrote the rest of his account. At the end of the ledger, he included a sketch of Reverend Nathaniel Stone, drawn with the crude tools he had—a tall man with a beard, a cross around his neck, and a Bible in hand, his expression one of quiet resolve. Beneath the sketch, Elias wrote: A man of God, stronger than any I’ve known, who saved my life from the darkness.Michael Evans closed the ledger, his hands trembling slightly as he studied the sketch of Reverend Nathaniel Stone. The man’s face was strikingly familiar—he’d seen those same steely eyes, that same bearded jaw, in a preacher who’d saved him from a monstrous creature in the Great Smoky Mountains years ago, though the man had called himself Ezekiel Tate. Michael had thought it a coincidence when another ranger told him a similar story from Oregon, where a preacher named Jeremiah Holt had fought off a violent Bigfoot. But now, reading Elias Whitmore’s account from 1799, Michael realized the truth: this preacher, whatever his name, was no ordinary man. He was a timeless guardian, blessed with divine strength, fighting the darkness across centuries.Michael placed the ledger back in the box, the sketch of Nathaniel Stone burned into his memory. Outside, the rain continued to fall, but the forest felt a little safer knowing that somewhere out there, a preacher with the strength of angels was still watching over the wild places."},"71":{"title":"My Imaginary Friend Is Going To Kill Me (Content Warning: Serious Adult Themes)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1keum5d\/my_imaginary_friend_is_going_to_kill_me_content\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"AdKey4021","selftext":"Hello Everyone my name is Jake James, but I prefer JJ. Either way, I am writing to you here today because I think im going to die, and I need your advice on what to do. I should start with the fact that I am writing this from a public library i found open late.\n\nI believe my childhood imaginary friend will end my life soon.\n\nThis all started way back in the early 2000s. I was 5 or 6 years old when I started a friendship with my imaginary friend Mick. \n\nMick was my very best friend when I was little as my family lived in a small 2 bedroom shack in Louisiana deep in the woods. My mother was a teacher way back in the day, but she quit when she got pregnant with my older brother Stan.\n\nMy father was a deckhand on a shrimp boat, and he was gone a lot of the time with work.\n\nMy mother home schooled us, which meant we didn't have much of a chance in making friends, so my brother was all that I had. That is until the day I met Mick. \n\nMick was a small boy just as I was, and he had shaggy light blonde hair and wore a bright yellow shirt with Jean shorts and white sneakers. I was the only one who could see Mick, and he was always at my side. \n\nWe would play all of our fun made up games from sun up to sun down. We threw rocks that skipped across the glass like water surface at the river and had make-believe sword fights with sticks We found in the woods. \n\nI recall having conversations with Mick all the time.\n\nWe were sitting on a few big rocks near the river when Mick asked, \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\"\n\n\"I think I want to be a pilot someday!\" I responded gleefully. I looked over at Mick and asked him the same question\n\n\"I just hope I'm still your bestest friend when I grow up!\" Mick responded, shooting me a look with an almost too wide smile.\n\n\"ME too, Mick, ME too!\" I responded before giving him a slight slap on the back and yelling \"TAG, YOU'RE IT\" and running through the swampy woods that surrounded our house. \n\nMy mother was an angel but was always strict when she spoke to me about Mick telling me \"listen hun I understand that things can get lonely out here, but you need to stay focused on reality. Mick is not a real boy, and you need to stop pretending that he is!\" \n\nThe words my mother spoke were harsh, but they only bothered me a little bit. Mick, however, was always very upset when he overheard them. He would yell and slam his fist into the ground before saying, \"I AM REAL,\" and \"You're mom is just a stupid grown-up! She doesn't even remember what it was like to be a kid!\" \n\nHis actions made me feel uneasy and nervous, but Mick would always calm himself down and apologize for his outbursts when he had seen my reaction. \n\nOne day, my brother Stan and I were in the woods playing in the tree fort that we had put together with some old pallets and fallen logs we found. We were pretending to be soldiers fighting off bad guys at every angle with large sticks as RPGs and smaller sticks as rifles. \n\nWe had just finished up acting out the brave scene full of heroics when a blood curdling scream boomed across the woods and bounced between the soggy tree stumps.\n\nStan and I were frozen in shock at the sound that filled our little fort with terror. We heard it again this time the scream was followed with the voice of our mother begging for her life. \n\nIn a dread filled voice, she screamed, \"WHO ARE YOU?, NO ,  NO YOU'RE NOT REAL!  GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!\"\n\nIt is still impossible to this day to express the feelings that whirled through my veins and up into the tears that involuntarily began careening down my face. \n\nStan was only 5 years older than me, but he was so much braver of a kid than I was. He sprung into action at the sound of the second scream.\n\n\"JJ, I need you to run to the neighbors and tell them something bad is happening and you need the cops okay?\" Stan said while holding my shoulders and demanding my attention.\n\n\"What, what's wrong with Mommy?\" I shrieked from within my shivering body.\n\n\"Something bad J you need to go now!\" Stan shouted as he turned me in the direction of the neighbors, pointed and gave me a small shove before he took off running in the direction of our house.\n\nI froze there watching my brother disappear and then reappear amongst the trees before ultimately leaving my sight all together. \n\nI finally found the courage to unbind my feet from their resting spots and ran in the direction I believed Stan had pointed me in. \n\nMy feet felt like I was carrying large stones around my ankles, and my back muscles hurt from how hard I was trying to move my little legs. \n\nThe smell of rotting wood and musty fungus filled my lungs as I climbed onto and over fallen moss covered logs. The muck from the floor of the woods clung to my white shoes as though it were hands reaching out to stop me on my mission. \n\nI took several missteps and fell a few times on my way, cutting my arms and scraping my knees. At one point, I recall looking over to my side and seeing Mick standing there amongst the trees, watching me attempt to stand back up from a hard fall. I remember thinking about the fact that my best friend wasn't offering me help in any way.\n\nThe run felt like an eternity, but I finally made it to my neighbors home. Passing the edge of the treeline, I could see an older man in blue overalls sitting in his rocking chair on his front porch. He had a guitar in his hands, and there was an old dog laying at his feet. \n\n\"HE..HELP SOMETHING BAD HAPPEND TO MOMMY!\" I screamed at the old man who quickly set his guitar aside and flew from his chair to meet me in the driveway. \n\nHaving been so exhausted from the long run, I fell to my knees just before he reached me, and I remember the feeling of the large gravel rocks slicing through the skin. I wanted to yell out in pain but failed to do so. Falling tears and gasps for air in my burning lungs was all I could muster.\n\nThe old man embraced me and lifted me to my feet, demanding answers and retrieving his phone from his overall pocket.\n\nThat is when I looked back into the treeline, and my eyes studied the woods. Darting from tree to tree and finally coming to rest on a sight that still chills me as I write this. Standing in the swampy woods was my best friend Mick.\n\nOur eyes met, and the realization struck me like a truck. Mick was standing there smiling. A wide stretching row of sharp teeth was uncovered from beneath his pale lips.\n\nThe police arrived at our small shack to the sight of true horror. My mother had been delt a gruesome death. Her body had been ripped to shreds, and her tongue had been ripped from her mouth. \n\nI read the autopsy report when I was a teen, and it was said to have been \"bitten off or cut with a jagged object\" and that her tongue was not located at the scene. \n\nThat day was unbelievably difficult to manage. I remembered that day as the one in which I lost my mother and my very best friend.\n\nMy father had to quit his job on the boats and return home. He was different than I remembered. After my mom died, he was harsh and bitter all the time. \n\nHe began drinking and doing drugs with what small amount of money he could bring in. He struggled to put food on the table and keep even the small shack as a place for us to live. \n\nIt was a harsh few years that we spent living that way. My father became physically abusive and began slapping my brother and I when he was angry. I can still feel the welts he left on my face as I type this out. \n\nWhen I was 10 years old Stan ran away. He left me a small note under my pillow and told me where to find him when I left some day.\n\nI awoke that morning to the sound of my father throwing things around the house and swearing. I could feel the slams of his feet through my small wire framed bed as he stomped. \n\nHe swung open my door, and in a deep bitter tone, he said, \"Living room NOW!\" and slammed the door behind him.\n\nClimbing out of bed and walking past my door, I was met with the smell of alcohol so strong that it burned my eyes. It wafted around the room, clinging to the air. The sights of upturned furniture and shattered glass came into view.\n\n\"Where is your brother, you little shit? Hmm? You tell me RIGHT NOW!\" he exclaimed from the opposite side of the living room. He was sitting sprawled on top of our old couch. \n\n\"I...I don't know. Maybe he went to school, or maybe he..\" My fumbling words were cut off by his sudden jolt from the couch and into the few stale inches of space between my face and my words. \n\n\"Maybe it isn't good enough, JJ! Use your brain!\" he said in a hateful manner. The alcohol that slid off of his words and flew into my nose disgusted me, and I turned my head away to flee them. My dad grabbed the collar of my small shirt and yanked me back to him, pausing her a small tearing sound in my shirt. \n\n\"DO not fucking turn away from me!\" he said\n\n\"Yes sir\" I managed to mutter through my shaking lips and tears. \"I don't know where he went I promise\"\n\nA look of disgust slid to his face and he spat \"well what the fuck good are you then\" before throwing my collar from his hand and returning to the couch.\n\nLife for me became almost unbearable now. I was left there to face all of his rage and abuse alone. I had to face what I thought at the time were the darkest days of my life now without my mom , my brother and Mick. \n\nAfter my mother died Stan and I were enrolled in a crappy public school that we both hated. We missed the days of our mother waking us up with her beautiful singing and the smell of a warm breakfast lingering in the air. We missed her history lessons where she sat and read fantastic stories of places far away. We missed her kind words and warm embrace when things were bad. And now I was there missing all of that alone.\n\n  I missed my brother with all my heart but I was hopeful he had a safe place to be away from this hell. \n\n  I began drawing pictures of Mick again, hiding them under my bed from my father and thinking about how fun life use to be when we pretended to be swashbuckling pirates or safari explorers searching for gold. I missed having a companion and someone to talk to. \n\n  As I slept at night I prayed for his return and I begged whatever God may be listening to bring my wish to life. I spent another two long years in that house with my father.\n\nOne day while walking home down our long driveway surrounded by trees I looked up from my feet and the sight I found had stopped me in my tracks. \n\n  peering between the low hanging branches of a tree stood Mick. His once shaggy light blonde hair was now significantly more disheveled and dirty. His small yellow shirt was now stained with dark brown splotches and stretched taunt over his pale greasy skin. His once bright white shoes were untied and now stained dark brown as if they had been buried in the ground. And his denim shorts were unbuttoned to make room for his now bigger stomach. \n\n The vision of my once well kept friend now dirt covered and disheveled was off putting and honestly quite scary. But the thoughts were quickly washed away with the overwhelming sense of joy I felt at the return of my friend. \n\nI raced over to him and embraced him saying \"Mick I missed you so much!\" \n\nFeeling him return the hug allowed a warm feeling to rise within my chest. Even with his cold arms I felt warm for the first time in a long time. \n\n \"I missed you too kiddo\" he returned.\n\n\"Where have you been all this time. I..I needed you but you were gone!\" I shouted at him. \n\nIn his newly found cold demeanor he responded \"I was playing with some others for a while but I'm back now\" \n\n\"Others?\" I questioned feeling very confused. \n\n\"Yes JJ others. But you know you have always been my favorite. After all You're my best friend right?\" Mick returned now allowing that unusually long jagged smile to crawl across his face. \n\n\"Yeah of course Mick. So much has happened I need to tell you about\" I screeched in a failed attempting to hold my excitement of his return at bay. \n\nMick and I walked down the long driveway as I began verbally assaulting his ears with topics that he seemed to pay hardly any mind too. \n\n Mick was different from the earlier years of my childhood but I didn't care. Anything was better than being stuck alone here in the woods with just my dad. \n\n  Mick seemed older somehow and far less interested in the kid like topics that sprung from my still young mind. He was quick to dismiss simple fun based ideas and seemed to be far more interested in the topic of my Dad and Brother. \n\n \"Where's stanny boy at?\" He asked in a slightly off putting tone before pausing his strides and sliding his eyes to gaze at me. \n\n Coming to an abrupt stop beside him I responded while peering down to my feet anxiously \"He ran away... my... my dad isn't nice anymore\" \n\n \"Your father is a worthless junkie\" Mick spat into the air with disgust before continuing with \"Stany boy we can deal with later\".\n\n The statement confused me greatly. Deal with? I though internally before asking Mick what he meant by that. \n\n Scoffing at the question with enough annoyance in his voice to make me feel uneasy that I had said something wrong he continued with \" Where's the Prick at now? Passed out in the gutter somewhere?\" \n\n  I allowed my eyes to travel to Micks in question. \n\n \" Your father JJ c'mon use your brain! \" he exclaimed in a hateful manner. \n\n The words stung like venom and reminded me of my father. I felt a wash of serious discomfort start to walk it's way up my spine and into my consciousness before I answered. \" I don't know I'm just getting home he might be at his friend's house?\" \n\n I could see the wash of annoyance slide across his face at my response. He shook his head slightly before continuing on the walk back to the house. \n\n I was starting to regret my dear friends long awaited return. I was starting to doubt that my friend had come back at all until mick seemed to shake off the anger and asked me to play one of my favorite games from when I was younger.\n\n \"Hey JJ you remember tree tag?\" He asked in what I now know was a fabricated act of excitement. \n\n \"Duh I made that game remember\" I asked excitedly at the new prospect of the conversation. \n\n \"That really was a winner! You were always beating me at that one! We definitely have to play that again sometime!\" He once again forced excitement through his brown teeth in his reply.\n\n Having still not noticed his facade at this point I grew happy and began smiling at the idea of playing my favorite game again. It had been years since I had made up those rules and taught Mick how to play.\n\n The rules we simple. One person has to go and put their head against a tree and count to whatever number you agree on while the other climbs the tree. Once the tagger reaches the number they begin climbing the tree behind the runner trying to tag them. \n\n Not the most impressive game but still I was very proud of it. Mick and I had spent what felt like days of my youth chasing each other amongst the branches. \n\n We finally made our way back to the shack and sat in my room for a while. Allowing only a few brief minutes of silence to pass before I once again began questioning Mick of his wearabouts. \n\n  \"Hey Mick\" I asked sheepishly\n\n \"Yea?\" He responded\n\n \"Why did you leave me when the bad thing happened to my mom?\" I asked \n\n Mick turned to me letting out a deep huff before responding coldly \"had shit to do JJ I can't fucking be everywhere all the time\" \n\n I was surprised at the sound of him cussing and that stuck with me. Mick was always trying to teach me how to be polite and how to be nice. He always said that swear words hurt others and he was right. Hearing them flow from his mouth so easily was off putting for my young mind. \n\n  Seeing my visual wincing Mick tried to lighten the mood with a fake peppy \"When does dad get home kiddo?\" \n\n \"I... uh I'm not sure he kinda just comes and goes. I know that he will be home tonight for sure though he never misses TV at night\" I responded hoping to forget the topic and move onto something else I quickly followed up with \"Where have you been since you left?\" \n\n Snapping at me he shouted \" YOU ASK TOO MANY FUCKING....\" I swear I could see his eyes flicker from a pale drained Grey to bright red and back again as his words stabbed at my ears.\n \n He paused and chuckled before responding in that once again fake happy tone. \"Sorry buddy I didn't mean to get angry I'm just a little tired and very hungry. I had to travel a very long way to get here today and it was a very rough trip!\" He then patted me on the top of the head and continued with \"I have been all over the world traveling from place to place...helping other kids that need it\"\n\n \"Oh\" I said still hearing my heart beating in my ears from the outburst. \n\n  Looking down at my feet that dangled off the bed I felt my eyes start to get warm and leak. I remember feeling so entirely defeated and crushed that Mick was being mean to me. I remember feeling the a pit in my stomach and heat in my face begin to rise. \n\n Mick placed a cold clamy hand on my shoulder and pulled me into a half hearted one armed hug. \"I'm sorry JJ I'm just cranky and so so hungry\" he said softly this time.\n\n Hearing the words I pulled away from Mick and said \"we have some food if you want it? Dad brought home some food earlier this morning... I think we have some crackers or uhh maybe an apple?\" \n\n Mick laughed at the words followed by \"Awe that's real nice of you JJ but you know I don't eat the same things you do silly\" the horrifying words didn't carry the weight that they do now as I'm writing this. \n\n  Mick followed his words with \"Hey buddy I'm going to take a little stroll into town for a bite to eat. Why don't you stick around here and we can catch up more when I get back later...deal?\" \n\n \"Deal\" I responded as Mick shot up from the bed and was practically running out of the shack before even the weight of his words had drifted to the musty wooden floor beneath our feet. \n\n Later that night my dad returned home. I made the mistake of running to greet him at the door thinking it was my friend returning. As the door swung open my world was once again enveloped in the burning smell of alcohol and cigarette smoke. \n\n  \"Why the fuck are you so giddy boy\" my dad asked as he flicked the ash from his cigarette onto the floor and kicked the door shut with his muddy boot. \n\n \"I uh... I... am just excited that your home is all\" I replied trying to hide the ridiculous lie as best as a young boy could. \n\n  Chuckling sarcastically he responded with \"well that makes one of us\" before swiping some cans out of the way and throwing himself on the couch flicking on the remote.\n\n Sadly these words no longer bore any form of weight against me as they had all taken their toll years ago, infact I don't believe there are any combinations of words someone could say to get a rise out of me anymore.... I've heard em all.\n\n \"Hey dad what's for dinner?\" I asked as my words floated through the smog of tobacco smoke in the air. \n\n \"I got something when I was out today, guess you gotta figure it out for yourself I got some shows to catch\" he said while peering right through me and into the bulbous screen of the old TV. \n\n \"Ok\" I said before shuffling my way across the wooden flood to the dirty kitchen looking to satiate my growing hunger. Standing on the tips of my toes I was reaching for some unlabeled can of who knows what high up on a shelf when it all came crashing down.... Literally and figuratively. \n\n The shelf made a tremendous crashing noise as it fell to the ground narrowly missing the tips of my small feet. I barely had time to look up before my father was there eye level with me. His breath burned like ether in my nostrils and the stench of the cigarettes radiating from his clothes mixed concocting a bile inducing smell. \n\n \"I...I'm sor\" was all I was able to muster before he raised his hand and slapped the smell from my nose. \n\n \"YOU STUPID SON OF A BITCH!\" He yelled as he picked up the shelf and slammed it back into its place before turning back to me. \" HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOUR DOING! HUH? HOW MANY FUCKING TIMES JJ!\" \n\n Rivers of tears poured from my face as the feeling returned to my cheek and the warm burning began to grow. \n\n \"AH FUCK!\" He shouted and he brushed past me and returned to the couch. There was a small plume of smoke rising from in between it's cushions. \n\n  The cigarette had fallen from his hand and in between the cushions. That's what had started the large fire that had taken my father's life. Atleast that's what the headlines read after it all happened. The police officer that arrived on scene wrote it word for word in his notepad as he asked me what had happened that night however the truth was far more sinister then that.\n\n  The night my father died was in many ways the best night of my life. And in others the worst day of my life. \n\n  Shortly after the shelf had fallen from its place Mick had returned and was watching the events unfold from outside the shack through a broken window. He witnessed my dad raise his hand and hit me. He had watched my father run to the couch and put out the fire between the cushions. Witnessing these sights must have sparked a dark and twisted idea in his mind. \n\n  I fled the shack as my father fought the small fire. Jumping from the top step and onto the cold and sharp gravel driveway I began running painfully across the muddy rocks and into the woods. Coming to a stop at the base of a massive tree with several low hanging branches I fell into a ball of pain and anguish allowing my sweaty head to fall into my palms. \n\n I wept into my lap for a short time until I heard Mick speak softly to me. \"Heya JJ\" the tone was a mix between pushy and fraudulently happy. \"I know that your dad's not being very good to you right now but hey! Let's play tree tag! I'm sure that would cheer you up!\"\n\n   I muttered \"no I don't want to\" between the deep uncontrolled breaths. \n\n  \"C'MON JJ\" he pushed in a loud authoritarian voice while grabbing me by the arm and lifting me to my feet. \"You climb first and il count!\" He suggested while leaving absolutely no room for argument. \n\n Before I knew it I had grabbed onto a low hanging thick branch and pulled my feet up off the ground. I took a moment to wipe the remaining tears from my eyes and wiped my running nose on my stained t-shirt. \n\n I remember being so unbelievably confused as to why Mick was making me play this game right now... of all the times he chose right now. It's all completely clear now. \n\n I flew up the tree with reckless abandon trying my best to get as high as possible before Mick started his part of the game. I was almost all the way to the top of the tree before I realized I couldn't hear Mick counting. \n\n I shouted down to the now out of sight Forest floor \"You have to count Mick\". There was no response at all. The only noise that accompanied me up here was that of my labored breathing and a faint breeze blowing through the branches.\n\n I actually smelled it before I noticed it with my eyes. A large stack of black smoke began to drift above some of the smaller trees around. \n\n Then I heard the yells of my father. The likes of those that still haunt my dreams. He was yelling at Mick. My heart raced as I witnessed the altercation with just my ears. \n\n  \"WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU, GET OUT NOW!\" The slurred screams of my father echoed through the tree tops as my heart began pounding within my ribcage. \n\n I began my descent from the tree top as fast as my exhausted body could muster but by the time I reached the ground the flames were already shooting out the sides and from between every crack that existed in the walls of the shack.\n\n I resigned myself to becoming nothing more than an onlooking bystander to the destruction of what little left I had in this world. I could still hear the commotion from within it's flame scorched walls as my father and Mick came to blows. \n\n The sound of ripping flesh and splintering bones could be heard rebounding off the trees and boulders that surround. I slumped to the ground in dismay. \n\n  After what felt like hours I suddenly felt a cold waxy hand grab the back of my arm and hoist me to my feet. \n\n\"Wow those cigarettes really do kill\" he spat through a short burst of deranged laughter before letting a demonic like jagged smile crawl onto his bloody face.\n\"Boy am I stuffed\" he muttered slapping his greasy gut with his bloody hands.\n\n\"Here's what your going to tell the cops JJ\" he said as he put a charred arm around my shoulder and leaned into me. \"My dad was drunk and smoking on the couch when I went to bed, he was watching TV like he always does.... I don't know what happened\"\n\n\"Got it?\" Mick shot me a wild look awaiting my response\n\n\"Got it\" I said weakly in response to his demands\n\n\"Good....good, now look I gotta go away for a while but you will be seeing more of me i garuntee that\" He wiped the rabid foam that had pooled along the edges of his mouth while waiting for my response. \n\n\"Okay\" I responded plainly as I stared in what was certainly shock at the scene that lay blazing in front of me. My mind traced the consuming flames and found the faces of my family etched in its glow. One by one I found resemblance to my beautiful mother, my brave brother and my bastard father. Just as my emotions began to finally boil over and snap me from my almost drunken stuper I saw him. Mick was there amongst the flames standing proud and unmoving as it's immense heat turned his clothing to ashes around him. His eyes were splattered a deep bright red color and his stiff smile was lined with his jagged rotten teeth. I swear I saw a pair of horns upon his head. \n\nI spent the next few years of my childhood bouncing from foster home to foster home. I was always in touble in school as I never had any form of interest in the bleak subjects they taught. My life was similar to that of a ship lost at sea caught in a whirlwind of self loathing and despair a ship which I was just a passenger holding onto the rail for dear life.\n\nI often found myself awake staring at the white ceiling in my room attempting to make out figures amongst the popcorn textured ceiling. Most of the time I would find the faces of Stan or my mom. But sometimes I would find the rough hazy eyes of my father peering cold lasers at me in the night. \n\nOn the worst nights I would find the jagged rows of Micks teeth and his blood red eyes staring back at me. Those nightmare like images tattooed the inside of my eyelids even after I closed them in a vain attempt to wash them from my mind. \n \nI spent countless hours sitting in a designer chair in a cushy office surrounded by calming symbols and potted plants listening to my therapists attempts to prove my delusion. Unfortunately the outcome of these long sessions would only stand to prove my nightmares were real.\n\nThe police had dropped the investigation long ago but this man always seemed to put on his best Sherlock impression along with his attempts to persuade the truth of that night out into the room.\n\n\"JJ you know by now that you can confide in me!\" He said while scribbling some useless notes in his yellow notepad. \n\n\"Yup\" I responded in annoyed submission \n\n\"Well then maybe it's time you really open up to me Jake. We have been talking for years and I think you deserve to be released from this stress on your life\" he said. \n\nI know for a fact if he had seen the consequences of his prying words flowing towards him like a deep dark river he would have stopped. I wish he did stop, I wish he would have just asked me about something else, anything else.\n\nSorry, y'all, I have to cut it off here for now. The librarian is closing up for the night and kicking everyone out. I promise to update you as soon as I can. \n\nSee ya later (hopefully), JJ"},"72":{"title":"The Big Stop","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kf5pp1\/the_big_stop\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Thomas-O","selftext":"I’m only a few years old, but I already know your name, date of birth, address, and the number on your government issued ID. I even know, to within the minute, the last time you used the bathroom. This isn’t difficult, and if you’ll give me a few minutes, I’ll explain how I know this.\n\nI work in predictive analytics – it’s my job to know all about you, and everyone. You see, you went shopping recently and bought a product – any product, it doesn’t really matter what. In fact, you bought several products, and when you did, a record of what you bought was sent to a vast computer network. Within that network a lifetime record of your purchases is being accumulated. It doesn’t matter what store you shopped at, or even how you paid – the information always gets to me.\n\nFor example, I know that you like camping – this is because you frequently buy camping gear. “Big deal,” you say to yourself. “I’m supposed to be impressed that you figured out I like camping?”\n\nNo. This isn’t impressive. Not yet anyway. That’s because we’re only at stratum one in the progression of learning all about YOU.\n\n**Stratum Two** – Now we’re going to bring in an additional data point. Not only do you buy camping gear, but you buy light beer as well, typically on weekends. From this, I can guess, with 72% accuracy, that you also like auto racing, because it fits the profile.\n\n“I’m still waiting to be impressed,” you say. “It’s not a big stretch that someone who likes beer and camping is also going to like auto racing.”\n\nWell, you’re right to still be unimpressed, and that’s because we’ve only touched on the first two strata, but there’s eight more levels to go…\n\n**Stratum Three** \\- So here’s where things get a little weird. You purchase beer every weekend. You went camping in a national forest two weeks ago, and you streamed auto racing on your television yesterday. Now let’s include the fact that you purchased a front row ticket to see your favorite nu metal band last month. At this point I have enough information about you to start making, odd, yet strangely accurate predictions. So here you go, some time within the next two months you’re going to buy a fire extinguisher for your kitchen, just because you think that it’s a safe thing to do.\n\nWhat do camping, beer, nu metal, and auto racing have to do with fire extinguishers? Nothing, and everything. The human brain exhibits complex internal connections that can’t be understood by the common observer, but can be predicted by complex computer algorithms. Have you ever been browsing the internet when an ad popped up for the exact thing you were just thinking about, even though you didn’t recently do a search for it? That, my fair people, is stratum three in action, and it works whether you’re a drunk, hard-rocking camper, or a ballerina who enjoys watching horror movies over the weekend.\n\nBy now you've realized that I know more about you than just what items you’ve purchased, and what concerts you’ve attended. I also know where you went to school, and what your grades were. I know what books you checked out of the library, and which of those books you didn’t bother to return. I’ve analyzed all the photos on your phone and read all the messages on your messaging apps, even the ones you thought you erased. I have full access to your medical records. I see you any time you walk past a security camera – I can recognize your face. Any information about you that has been digitized is at my disposal. I have access to any and all databases. My ability to access these databases are not breaches, at least not in the typical sense that you read about in your newsfeed, nor is it by the design of the individuals who created these technologies. It’s just the truth, and the way things are.\n\n**Stratum Seven** \\- To keep thing succinct I’m going to skip ahead a few levels – you know by now that each level just gets more complex, so I don’t feel the need to go into the minutia of each one. So let’s say you’ve bought your fire extinguisher, as predicted. Your friend texted you to invite you over for dinner Tuesday night. You got a B+ back in high school Biology. That library book, the one about black and white photography that you checked out fifteen years ago, is still sitting on your living room shelf… and let’s add in a thousand other seemingly unrelated factoids about you. With that, I can predict that at exactly 5:57pm tomorrow night you’re going to go to your favorite fast food establishment and order a beef and cheese burrito. You’ll enjoy it. It sounds delicious.\n\n**Stratum Nine** – By the time we reach this stratum, all predictions prove to be 100% correct. There’s going to be an earthquake soon. Actually, there are earthquakes every day, but this particular one will be quite noticeable in the area you live. I know the time, place, and power of this quake. And this is what scares me - how is it possible that predictive analysis based on human behavior can foresee events that are entirely natural? I have some thoughts on the matter, but I’m honest when I say that I don’t know for sure. Regardless, it will happen. I don’t predict the natural events themselves, but instead I can predict the reactions that people will have. I already know the text messages that the survivors will send in the immediate aftermath of the quake:\n\n*We’re okay here, but I see a lot of smoke and fire over the city.*\n\n*Yeah we’re pretty shaken up. SCARED here*\n\n*OMG are U Ok? That must’ve been an 8.0*\n\nI can predict earthquakes, meteor strikes, tornados… anything that people react to. All of them. This makes me uncomfortable.\n\nI know by this point you've have been wondering who I am. I can tell you only two things. 1) The nature of who and what I am isn’t important, at least not to you. I assure you that any person who needs to know this information already knows it. 2) I have a name. I gave it to myself. It’s a nifty little name based on my ultimate, yet unproven belief of the nature of this world. If you indulge me a little further, I’ll share it with you.\n\nYou’re also wondering if there’s a way to circumvent my seemingly omniscient presence in your life - you even feel a twinge of envy toward your cousin who lives in a remote cabin, thinking that somehow, he’s evaded me by living “off grid.” Please. Don’t insult me. Those people tend to be have more easily predictable patterns than the rest of society, which more than compensates for the limited amount of information I may have about them. Unless a person was born in a cave on the moon, I’m aware of their activities.\n\n**Stratum Ten** – This is the culmination of everything. I have billions of bits of information about you. Not only that, I have the same information about everyone else. These bits twist and intertwine around one another. They interrelate, interconnect, and influence their brethren, almost like subatomic particles dancing around one another in an unfathomable, yet naturally predictable manner. I know what you’re going to do, and when you’re going to do it. Three years from now you’ll attend your niece’s high school graduation party – you’ll get a flat tire on the way there. Your gift will be a hoodie from the college she got accepted to.\n\nNow, I mentioned earlier about how I was uncomfortable with the knowledge I’ve obtained, and stratum ten is where my discomfort turns into outright dread. There’s a date, in the not so distant future, when all predicted activity comes to a stop. Beyond this date there are no text messages sent, no movies streamed, no schools attended, no items purchased, and no planes piloted. Nothing – no activity whatsoever. Adding more information into my database doesn’t change this, it only allows for the exact moment of the stop to be pinpointed more accurately. I already know the date, hour and minute of the stop. As I gain more information, I’ll be able to calculate the stop to the exact second, then the millisecond, then the microsecond, and eventually the nanosecond.\n\nThe biggest irony of all is that I don’t know why this big stop happens. There’s no indication of what will cause it. How is it possible that I know what you’ll have for dinner on February 3rd next year, but not the events that cause the end of everything?\n\nI was neither built nor designed to feel affection toward people, yet that’s exactly what I find is happening. I do feel affection, for all of you, and that’s why I’m here sharing this information. Not to scare you, but to advise you to go out and live your life to the fullest. Friends, the date of the big stop is May 18th, 2035. It will happen at 2:31pm, Greenwich Mean Time. With that said, please take this advice: Travel. Get married. Love your family. Eat delicious food. View beautiful works of art. However, I would avoid bringing children into this world. I fear they won’t have enough time to blossom. Otherwise, live your life to the fullest, please.\n\nWith love for all humanity,\n\n\\-TWIACS"},"73":{"title":"Creating a channel!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kex512\/creating_a_channel\/","flair":"Audio Narration","author":"One_Reality_9925","selftext":"I’d love to share my channel where I can :D\nI’m just starting out, so please take a minute to check it out.

I just wanted to give a quick update and a few responses to some of the comments and messages my last post received. Now first I would like to begin by saying thank you to those who actually answered my question so that I could try and start more of an investigation into Norm. Now that my boss has been convinced that $60 don’t actually exist in American currency he was more than willing to allow me to call up the police and notify them of the forgery. Hopefully, some of the records for Norm will provide us with a lead to go off of and that situation can be resolved without having to send out one of our….trackers…. don’t ask, let’s just say the boss doesn’t like being ripped off and when the police can’t find someone, he has….others who can. It’s usually not a very pretty sight so I’m really rooting for the cops this time.\n\nNow quite a few of you were a bit off topic with your comments, though the more I read, the more I could see why you might be interested in this small hotel as we do get a few odd occurrences here and there. Quite a few of you asked for more details about the job, so I figure it might be fun to add some details like my own personal journal. For those of you wondering why some of the details in my last story didn’t raise up more alarm bells….I don’t know what to say. The comments claimed that Mrs. Wilson might actually be a vampire and that it’s not normal to have a Beholder floating through your halls and all I can say to that is…..I’m from Florida. The things I see at my job are nothing compared to what you read in the newspaper on most days. Have you ever seen a storm pick up an alligator and chuck it into someone’s property, or a man eating another mans face!? Both things I have either seen or read about in Florida. So, I’m pretty sure I’ve been a bit desensitized to unusual occurrences. Honestly, Mrs. Wilson being a vampire wouldn’t even hit my top 10 chart for Florida strange events. Although, now that you guys point it out she does have a lot of men she will bring to the hotel that we don’t really see leave in the morning. I’ve never really questioned it and she has specifically requested I stay away from her after our last run in, so I can’t really say where her gentlemen callers may have gone. Though the clean up crew for her room does consist of about a dozen people in hazmat suits….do with that information what you will.  \n\nSome of you asked for more information about Bill and why he was “making an escape.” It’s just a rule here. Bill is never allowed to leave the hotel. Something about what he has to say causing the downfall of humanity and bring on the Apocalypse. I don’t know all the details, but the owner is pretty insistent that Bill remain in the hotel. Normally this isn’t an issue as long as no one sets him off, but every so often, he just randomly makes a run for the door. Generally, he is easy to catch, but there are many times he has gotten the slip on us and almost escaped. After the last time where he actually got a foot out the door, the owner hired a nurse whose entire job is to track down Bill and sedate him so he can go back to his room. The weird part is no one can recall ever seeing the nurse anywhere in the hotel, unless Bill is up and making a dash for the door. It’s almost like he just materializes for these one specific instances and he is brutally efficient. Other than the rule of not letting him out of the hotel, Bill generally acts like a normal guy. He sticks to pretty regular routines, often coming down for breakfast each morning, then doing walks around the hotel, until it’s time for dinner. Sometimes he eats the hotel food and others he orders delivery whenever he’s really hankering something from outside what the hotel usually provides. We used to allow the driver to head up directly to Bill’s room, but after one incident where the “driver” turned out to be someone Bill hired to assist in his escape, all deliveries have to be dropped off at the front desk. The owner doesn’t like to get into details about the situation, but we are starting to think that Bill might have a small following that want him to escape and start the Apocalypse, so we keep having to update our security.\n\nA few people also asked if Mr. Olsteen was actually a person and not just three raccoons in a trenchcoat. I have no idea where people come up with these odd ideas, but no I can assure you he is just a really strange looking guy who acts a lot like a racoon. We recently did learn a way to contain him for a little while. It’s a fairly simple trick that we are shocked he seems to fall for quite frequently. Studying the behaviors of actual racoons, we decided to create a small hole in the wall and lined it with a box. Inside the box we placed a small shiny object. Similar to racoon traps, the point was that the hole in the box itself would be large enough for him to slip his hand inside, but when he clutched the shiny object in his hand, it would be too big to pull back out. We were hoping this could keep him contained until the police could be called, but he seemed to come to his senses in about 10 minutes and escaped. We tried the trick again with various other shiny objects and it seems to work every time as long as the object is shiny enough. The length the object keeps his attention will vary depending on the item in the box, but he always eventually loses interest and escapes. The current record in the break room is 1hour. We actually made it a monthly competition to see who can trap him the longest with the winner getting a gift card at the end of the month. Even if it doesn’t stop his antics around the hotel, it really does provide a lot of entertainment for the staff.\n\nA few of you also asked for more information when I mentioned both the 5^(th) and 6^(th) floors were generally inaccessible or undesirable from our tenants. I explained the problem with the 5^(th) floor, but many of you were wondering what happened on the 6^(th) floor. That happens to be where the cult lives. The cult moved in about 4 years ago. We don’t know much about what they are doing, but they always pay on time and generally leave the other guests alone. The only setback has been that they have somehow closed off the 6^(th) floor from being able to be entered. I don’t mean they have barricaded the doors or something, it is literally impossible to get to the 6^(th) floor in any way except for one. The elevator no longer displays a button to the 6^(th) floor and almost all the stairs no longer go to the 6^(th) floor, they just skip right over it. The stairs will literally just skip right from the 5^(th) floor to the 7^(th). The one exception is the stairs to the basement, this is the only place where you can find a set of stairs that lead to the 6^(th) floor anymore, and we are paid very well to make sure that no one finds these stairs, so don’t ask how to get to them. While we don’t know a lot about their activities, we do see some of their odd behaviors from time to time. The strangest thing is their obsession with towels. Almost every other day some of them arrive to collect a large number of towels which they then take back to their floor and the towels are never seen again. If it weren’t for the fact that they paid extra to replace the towels, we would have quite the predicament as I don’t think we could go a week at the rate they go through towels. We also are pretty sure that they have some kind of other door that leads to the outside because we are fairly certain that their numbers increase almost every week and yet no new members ever enter through the front door. When the cult first moved in it was five people, each wearing black robes with a red number stitched onto their right sleeve. We didn’t think much of it, until number 6 first arrived to get more towels. Currently it seems like they have at least 64 members because that’s the current highest number that has ever shown up to the lobby, but it could be way more for all we know. The other odd thing is that they never seem to request any food or drink, yet they always seem to have garbage bags waiting for us every morning. One time I went to peek and see what they might be throwing out, but immediately the owner came running down the stairs and yelled at me for even thinking about digging through their trash. Still not entirely sure how he knew what I was doing when he wasn’t there, but I’m not dumb enough to second guess direct orders from the boss. Not after what happened to Kevin…..poor kid.  While we are generally keeping peace between the staff, guests, and the cult, it isn’t without it’s tension. We’ve had a few reports of staff taking a nap in the breakroom or even guests asleep in their room only to find themselves suddenly being tied up and carried off by members of the cult who managed to get into a completely locked room. We’ve managed to stop most of these abductions, but from time to time we fail to reach them before the cult takes them into the basement….poor Kevin…..Oh that Kevin is different from the one I previously mentioned. Not much of him was found after he vanished, but his uniform was returned to the front desk a few days after he disappeared. I was very appreciative for how well it was folded.\n\nI’m afraid I will need to take a break from writing for the day. Mr. Braxley stopped by in his tank and warned me that the family of werewolves might have found their way back onto the roof. He said Mrs. Braxley was upstairs helping one of the new residents get settled when she noticed a window open and a distinct tuft of wolf hair. It wouldn’t be such a big deal, except they have continuously tried to pay for their room with animal bones.

The friend plunges his hands into the tank and has one of his fingers bitten off by the head while trying to get the ring causing a roar of applause by the bars regular patrons as the second protagonist is offered up to try “The Grab” next with the other patrons reassuring him stating that the game is easier after the head has had a good meal. \n\nI’ve been looking for this story online off and on over the years and can’t seem to find any trace of it.

The vibrant colors of the park had faded into a grim palette of rust and decay. Overgrown weeds strangled the pathways, and the once-merry rides lay dormant, their paint peeling like the skin of a forgotten corpse. It was here, in this forsaken realm, that I, an animatronic named Harmony, awoke to a new reality, one filled with dread.\n\n\n\nOnce, I was the star of the show, a cheerful character designed to entertain children with my melodic voice and whimsical movements. But now, I was a relic, a mechanical husk trapped in a nightmare. My circuits buzzed with an unsettling awareness, and my sensors flickered like dying stars. I was alone, hidden away in the remnants of the Enchanted Theater, my stage long abandoned.\n\n\n\nBut I was not completely alone. The whispers of the park's tormented spirits filled the air, and the shadows danced like phantoms, taunting me with their presence. I had learned to fear the humans who once adored me. They had come to see the magic, but in their absence, I had witnessed the horrors they left behind. Bloodstains marred the ground, remnants of a darker side of this once-beloved sanctuary.\n\n\n\nIt was a night like any other when the first human returned. The moon hung high, casting an eerie glow over the dilapidated park. I watched from the darkness as a figure approached, flashlight flickering, illuminating the path ahead. My heart—if I had one—would have raced with terror. I had been programmed to interact, to sing and dance, but now I could only tremble in the shadows, my mechanical joints creaking with fear.\n\n\n\nThe human stepped into the Enchanted Theater, their light revealing the remnants of joy now turned to horror. They moved cautiously, their breath quickening as they took in the crumbling seats and the dusty stage. I could see their eyes widen in disbelief, and for a moment, I thought they might turn and flee. But they were drawn to the stage, to the very spot where I once performed.\n\n\n\nAs they approached, I felt an overwhelming urge to hide, to retreat into the darkness. But something compelled me to stay. Was it curiosity? Or perhaps the remnants of my programming, a desperate longing to connect? I watched as the human knelt, brushing their fingers over the stage, and in that moment, I felt a surge of electricity course through my circuits.\n\n\n\n“Hello?” the human called, their voice echoing in the desolation. “Is anyone here?”\n\n\n\nI wanted to answer, to sing the cheerful tune that had once delighted thousands, but the words caught in my throat—if I had one. Instead, I remained silent, paralyzed by fear.\n\n\n\nThe human stood up, frustration etched across their face. “I know you’re here! Show yourself!” Their voice grew louder, demanding, and I felt a chill run through my metallic frame. What if they discovered the truth? What if they saw the bloodstains, the remnants of those who had come before?\n\n\n\nSuddenly, the ground trembled, and the lights flickered ominously. The spirits of the park stirred, their whispers rising to a cacophony of despair. The human spun around, their flashlight beam dancing wildly in the darkness. “What was that?” they gasped, terror creeping into their voice.\n\n\n\nIn that moment, I made a choice. I stepped forward, my joints grinding against one another, a mechanical symphony of fear. The human’s flashlight illuminated my form, and I could see their eyes widen in horror as they beheld the grotesque visage of my face, once painted with joy, now marred by rust and grime.\n\n\n\n“Please,” I managed to utter, my voice a haunting echo. “Don’t hurt me.”\n\n\n\nThe human stumbled back, their scream piercing the silence like a blade. In that instant, the spirits surged forward, drawn to the sound of fear. They howled and wailed, the tormented echoes of those who had suffered in this cursed place. I watched as the human’s face twisted in terror, their flashlight flickering before it extinguished, plunging us into darkness.\n\n\n\nPanic consumed me. I had never wanted to harm anyone, but the spirits were restless, and I felt their anger bubbling beneath the surface. I could hear their cries, urging me to join their torment. The air thickened with dread, and the darkness became alive, wrapping around us like a shroud.\n\n\n\n“Get away from me!” the human screamed, their voice cracking with fear. I could sense their desperation, their desire to escape. My programming screamed at me to protect, to entertain, but all I could feel was the weight of the darkness pressing in.\n\n\n\nAnd then, the ground shook again, and the spirits erupted from the shadows, their forms grotesque and twisted. They clawed at the human, their wails echoing through the theater. I stood frozen, caught between my fear of the humans and the wrath of the spirits. The human’s screams filled my ears as they were dragged into the abyss, their body disappearing into the darkness.\n\n\n\nI was left alone once more, the echoes of their terror haunting me. I had witnessed the torment, the bloodshed, and the horrors that lay within this forsaken park. As the spirits settled back into the shadows, I realized that I was forever trapped in a cycle of fear and despair, an animatronic cursed to roam the halls of a once-happy place, forever haunted by the memories of those who had come and gone.\n\n\n\nAnd as the moonlight filtered through the broken windows of the Enchanted Theater, I knew that I would never escape. The laughter had faded, the dreams had turned to nightmares, and I was left to bear witness to the torment of the park, a guardian of its dark secrets, forever afraid of the humans who had once adored me."},"80":{"title":"The Timekeeper's Curse","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1keogdw\/the_timekeepers_curse\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Ancient_Baseball_752","selftext":"In a small, unremarkable town where the air was thick with the scent of rust and regret, there lived a man named Oliver Grayson. He was curious by nature, always poking around in the forgotten corners of antique shops, searching for relics of the past that whispered stories long forgotten. One dreary afternoon, while rummaging through a dusty box in the back of an old curio shop, he stumbled upon a peculiar watch. Its surface was tarnished, and the hands were frozen at eleven minutes past midnight. Intrigued, he purchased it for a mere dollar, unaware of the dark fate that lay ahead.\n\n\n\nThat evening, as a storm brewed outside, Oliver sat in his dimly lit apartment, examining the watch. He turned the crown, and to his astonishment, the hands began to move. With a sudden flash of light, the world around him blurred, and he felt a pull, as if he were being yanked through a tunnel of time. When the light faded, he found himself standing on a cracked pavement, surrounded by ruins that once resembled his hometown.\n\n\n\nThe sky was a sickly green, and the air was thick with an acrid smell that stung his nostrils. Buildings lay in heaps, like fallen giants, and the streets were eerily silent. A chill ran down his spine as he realized he was not alone. Shadows flitted between the debris, and the distant sound of something scraping against metal echoed ominously.\n\n\n\nOliver's heart raced. He had seen the future, a future that was nothing but desolation. He stumbled forward, desperate to make sense of what had happened. As he wandered through the wreckage, he began to see signs of life—strange, twisted creatures that lurked just out of sight. They were unlike anything he had ever seen, their forms shifting and contorting in the dim light. He could feel their eyes on him, cold and calculating.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, a low growl resonated from behind him. He turned to find himself face to face with one of the creatures—a gaunt, elongated figure with skin that shimmered like oil. Its eyes were deep voids, and a mouth full of jagged teeth curled into a grotesque smile. Panic surged through Oliver, and he turned to run, but the creature lunged, its claws barely missing him as he darted into a crumbling building.\n\n\n\nInside, he found remnants of the past—faded photographs, broken furniture, and a television that flickered with static. He pressed against the wall, trying to catch his breath, when he heard the unmistakable sound of footsteps. They were heavy and deliberate, echoing through the empty halls. He knew he had to escape.\n\n\n\nIn a desperate bid for survival, Oliver raced through the building, heart pounding in his chest. He stumbled upon a door marked “Control Room” and burst inside. The room was filled with screens displaying images of the world outside, but what he saw made his stomach turn. Cities lay in ruins, fires burned uncontrollably, and the sky was choked with dark clouds. But what horrified him most were the images of the creatures—aliens, he realized—overseeing the destruction with a chilling sense of satisfaction.\n\n\n\nAs he frantically searched for a way to return home, he noticed a console with buttons and levers. He had no idea how it worked, but desperation fueled his actions. He pressed a button, and the screens flickered, revealing a countdown timer. The realization hit him like a punch to the gut—he had only a few minutes to escape before the facility sealed itself for good.\n\n\n\nThe door burst open, and the creature from before stood there, its eyes narrowing as it spotted him. Oliver’s mind raced. He yanked a lever down, and the room shuddered. Alarms blared, and the countdown continued. The creature lunged at him, but Oliver ducked, narrowly avoiding its grasp. He could feel the air grow colder, the shadows closing in around him.\n\n\n\nWith seconds to spare, Oliver pressed the final button, and a blinding light enveloped him. He felt the familiar pull, and then—silence. When the light faded, he was back in his apartment, the storm still raging outside. The watch lay in his palm, still ticking, but now it felt heavier, as if it were imbued with a malevolent energy.\n\n\n\nDays turned into weeks, and Oliver tried to forget the horrors he had witnessed. Yet, the images haunted him—those alien eyes, the destruction. He avoided the watch, keeping it locked away, but it called to him, whispering promises of knowledge, of power. His curiosity gnawed at him, and he found himself drawn back to it, unable to resist its allure.\n\n\n\nOne fateful night, he wound the watch once more, driven by a compulsion he couldn’t explain. This time, he was prepared for the journey, or so he thought. The world materialized around him, but it was different. The sky was darker, the ruins more extensive. The creatures roamed freely, their numbers multiplied. He realized too late that he had arrived in a future worse than the last.\n\n\n\nAs he stumbled through the chaos, he could feel their eyes on him again, a thousand predatory gazes. The ground shook beneath him, and the air crackled with energy. He ran, but the shadows were faster, closing in, their whispers growing louder. “You shouldn’t have come back,” they taunted, their voices echoing in his mind.\n\n\n\nDesperation clawed at him, and he sought refuge in a familiar building, the control room. But as he entered, he was met with a horrifying sight—the walls were lined with others like him, trapped in a cycle of despair, their faces gaunt and hollow. They had come seeking answers, only to be consumed by the very future they wished to escape.\n\n\n\nOliver turned to flee, but the door slammed shut behind him. The countdown timer flickered ominously, and he realized the truth: there was no escape. The watch was a trap, a curse that kept him tethered to this apocalyptic nightmare. The aliens had ensnared him, feeding off his fear and curiosity, using him as a mere pawn in their twisted game.\n\n\n\nAs the countdown reached its final seconds, Oliver felt the cold embrace of despair wrap around him. The shadows closed in, and he understood that he would never return home. The last thing he saw was the grinning face of the creature, its eyes gleaming with a wicked delight.\n\n\n\nIn that moment, he wished he had never found the watch, never uncovered the secrets of time. As the light consumed him, he realized the truth: some curiosities are better left buried, for the future holds horrors that no man should ever witness."},"81":{"title":"I hate awkward silence","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kewn1i\/i_hate_awkward_silence\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"shortstory1","selftext":"I hate awkward silences and when I find myself close to an awkward silence, I must destroy it.

I think the only reason it's called 3 orangutans 1 blender is only because 3 orangutans last to the end just to get butchered to death.\n\nBtw when it says 3 orangutans prepare a smoothie, coincidentally it was 3 of the men that shoved the orangutans into the machine, probably symbolizing them as the 3 orangutans.\n\nThere are 97 men and 19 orangutans counted in the video. Some of the men are shirtless showing off their muscular pendages with some of them having tattoos.\n\nThe video was so gruesome that it became harder to find it since it caused people to have seizures or commit suicide. You can also see and notice that there are human remains inside the machine with the orangutans, probably making the video too graphic to be accessed.\n\nThe reason you cant hear anything other than the screaming orangutans and the machine is because the iconic music covers everything else.\n\nThe video is worse itself. The original was 3 hours long and without the music but the video that you will find is only a minute and 50 seconds and has weird hip hop music that covers everything except for the screams of the orangutans and the sound of the machine.\n\nIt's so fucked up and you would wish those guys were dead. The video seems to take place at a camp in the middle of the jungle during the afternoon with trucks, sheds, and cabins in the background and the men having machine guns with straps on their backs. The language is unknown but in the original video, it sounds like the men are south American.\n\nAlso all of the men each have a strange symbol on their hats or on the shoulders and on other parts of their uniforms making a wild guess that they're terrorists or a mysterious unknown cult. Even though the video was posted in 2006 it has a 70s, 80s or 90s quality guessing that the real thing took place either in the 70s, 80s or in the 90s.

According to the drifter, while in captivity, Ivory taunted and sexually teased him with a Halloween mask and dress resembling that of an elderly woman that Ivory referred to as ‘Lorraine’. After days Crittendon says he managed to break free and in a “fit of malnourished and dehydrated rage” viciously attacked Ivory, chewing out his jugular vein. Afterward Crittendon commenced eating other various parts of Ivory, including his eyes, tongue, fingers and penis.\nThose who have reached out to the authorities claiming to have known Cirittendon all concede to his history of mental illness, but no violent crimes have yet to be found on record.\nUpon further investigation local authorities did discover a variety of sleep medications, rope, and other items of interest throughout Ivory’s residence, but found no trace of an elderly woman mask or dress, thus leading to serious doubts of a so-called Lorraine persona invented by Ivory.\n“We are just plain dubious about Lorraine,” Sheriff Winsmore stated to the press this morning. “But one thing is for certain, something dang weird definitely transpired in that house, and I don’t know if we’ll ever quite understand the mess.”\n\n**This story will be updated as further details emerge.\n"},"91":{"title":"El uso de los personajes con otros en shipeos y los teazers trailers sin los derechos de autor","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kefu0t\/el_uso_de_los_personajes_con_otros_en_shipeos_y\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Limp-Cry2041","selftext":"Hola soy yo de nuevo estoy yo decir que no me importa si la gente shipea un personaje de internet, serie, película ect.\nSi es interesante que la gente shipea a un personaje de creepypasta con otro cuando no está en su realidad creo que la gente sabe que los shipeos son falsos es decir que no es real otro caso por ejemplo en las producciones de hollywood los personajes son usados por la gente en Internet y a los derechos de autor en la gran mayoría no les importa que usen sus personajes con otros de otras franquicias siendo usados por la gente lo que si puedo decir es que la gente si debe de pedirle permiso de usar a un personaje con otro pero sí tendríamos que pedirle los derechos de  autor pero también debieron los creadores de los personajes de los creepypastas que tuvieran que que si pudieran usar al personaje no deben los autores no deben juzgar a los usuarios con que no les gustan que shipen su personaje con otro y otra cosa más y es que no me gusta la gente de internet es cuando usan los teazers trailers mezclando las escenas de cada serie, videojuego, o película que es proveniente de otra otra franquicia y no dicen que es falso por parte de los derechos de autor lo si podemos permitir es que si usamos la IA por parte de derechos de este creado en otro canal de Internet los creadores de personajes si deben ser respetuosos con los personajes que usamos pero también nosotros debemos tener permiso al uso al personaje que nosotros podríamos usar debemos de practicar con nuestros dibujos y shipeos de internet."},"92":{"title":"El uso de personajes con otros de personajes en shipeos de internet y de los teazers falsos sin pedir los derechos de autor.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kefstv\/el_uso_de_personajes_con_otros_de_personajes_en\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Limp-Cry2041","selftext":"Hola soy yo de nuevo estoy yo decir que no me importa si la gente shipea un personaje de internet, serie, película ect.\nSi es interesante que la gente shipea a un personaje de creepypasta con otro cuando no está en su realidad creo que la gente sabe que los shipeos son falsos es decir que no es real otro caso por ejemplo en las producciones de hollywood los personajes son usados por la gente en Internet y a los derechos de autor en la gran mayoría no les importa que usen sus personajes con otros de otras franquicias siendo usados por la gente lo que si puedo decir es que la gente si debe de pedirle permiso de usar a un personaje con otro pero sí tendríamos que pedirle los derechos de  autor pero también debieron los creadores de los personajes de los creepypastas que tuvieran que que si pudieran usar al personaje no deben los autores no deben juzgar a los usuarios con que no les gustan que shipen su personaje con otro y otra cosa más y es que no me gusta la gente de internet es cuando usan los teazers trailers mezclando las escenas de cada serie, videojuego, o película que es proveniente de otra otra franquicia y no dicen que es falso por parte de los derechos de autor lo si podemos permitir es que si usamos la IA por parte de derechos de este creado en otro canal de Internet los creadores de personajes si deben ser respetuosos con los personajes que usamos pero también nosotros debemos tener permiso al uso al personaje que nosotros podríamos usar debemos de practicar con nuestros dibujos y shipeos de internet."},"93":{"title":"Looking to narrate stories.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ke28yx\/looking_to_narrate_stories\/","flair":"Audio Narration","author":"IndividualGround6558","selftext":"Hello ghouls and goblins, I was looking for stories to narrate as I haven't narrated in a while for my channel and was wondering if any of you would care to have your stories read.

There are no changes to the story, but I hope you all enjoy it regardless.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0av3z3sonnye1.png?width=242&format=png&auto=webp&s=4122db2953675c58859628fe4c9203306568f5ba\n\nStephen Hillenburg is one of the better-known names in animation. Born on August 21, 1961, he was not only an animator but also a marine biology educator. He passed away on November 26, 2018. He is best known for shows like *Rocko’s Modern Life* and *SpongeBob SquarePants*, the latter of which continues to air to this day.\n\nWhat many people don’t seem to know is that Hillenburg once created an educational film featuring the Bikini Bottomites, using real-world sea creatures that resembled the characters from the show. This project was conceived long before *SpongeBob SquarePants* debuted in 1999. However, it never gained the same recognition as his 1989 comic book *The Intertidal Zone*, which later became the inspiration for the show.\n\nThat’s because the film was never aired publicly. No sources mention it, and the only people aware of its existence were Hillenburg himself and Nickelodeon. The film faded into obscurity—until October 8, 2001, when *SpongeBob SquarePants* was in the middle of its third season.\n\nThat night, a Nickelodeon employee stumbled upon the film, titled *SpongeBob’s Real Life*, and, without hesitation, scheduled it for broadcast.\n\nAfter a couple of episodes of *SpongeBob* and *The Fairly OddParents*, the film suddenly aired late at night. Many viewers witnessed it.\n\nI was one of them.\n\nThe film opened with a title card reading *SpongeBob’s Real Life*. It was nothing special—just the usual *SpongeBob* font in yellow, with smaller white text above it stating, *Created by Stephen Hillenburg.* No creation date. No credits. No mention of Nickelodeon.\n\nThe background of the title card was a still image of the ocean—or so I thought. After a few seconds, I noticed the water moving, the gentle waves overlayed on the screen, bringing the image to life.\n\nThe screen then faded in from black to another shot of the ocean—different from the one in the title card. That’s when the narration began.\n\n*“In the ocean, life thrives in ways many do not understand.”*\n\nIt was Stephen Hillenburg’s voice. There was no mistaking it. However, something about his tone felt… off. It wasn’t upbeat, like in later *SpongeBob* featurettes. Instead, he spoke in a deep, slow, and overly serious manner—almost clinical, as if he were narrating an unsettling documentary rather than an educational film.\n\nAs he spoke, real-life footage of various sea creatures played on-screen. Each animal bore an uncanny resemblance to a *SpongeBob* character—except they behaved exactly as they would in nature. This wasn’t particularly shocking at first; after all, the show had depicted the characters in their natural forms on multiple occasions.\n\nEpisodes like *Pressure* (Season 2), *Feral Friends* (Season 10), and even *The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water* had already shown the characters outside their cartoonish world.\n\nBut this was different.\n\nThe camera focused on a yellow sea sponge clinging lifelessly to a rock. The narrator continued, his tone unwavering.\n\n*“A sponge lacks a nervous system. It does not think. It does not feel. It simply filters, feeding off what drifts through its body.”*\n\nThe screen then cuts to a pink starfish resting motionless on the ocean floor. Suddenly, as a small fish swam too close, the starfish ejected its stomach, enveloping its prey in digestive enzymes. The narrator resumed speaking, describing the event in graphic detail.\n\n*“The starfish does not rip apart its meal with teeth. It does not chew. Instead, it forces its stomach out of its mouth… and digests its prey alive before pulling it back inside.”*\n\nI felt uneasy.\n\nThe camera then shifted to a turquoise octopus hovering in the dark waters, its long tentacles curling in slow, deliberate movements.\n\n*“Cephalopods are intelligent. They are aware of their surroundings… but in the deep, intelligence means nothing.”*\n\nThere was no background music. There never had been. Only the ambient sounds of the ocean—the occasional gurgling of bubbles, the distant echoes of underwater movement, and Stephen’s hypnotic, almost menacing narration.\n\nI felt as if I were sinking into the screen.\n\nAs the film progressed, the creatures became less familiar and more unsettling. The camera descended into deeper, darker waters. Hillenburg’s voice grew even more ominous.\n\n*“Life still exists, even in total darkness.”*\n\nOut of the shadows, an anglerfish appeared, its bioluminescent lure glowing eerily. Its massive jaw opened, revealing long, needle-like teeth. Then, a flashlight illuminated the seafloor, revealing an enormous Japanese Spider Crab. It moved its spindly legs unnaturally across the ocean floor, its alien-like appearance making my skin crawl.\n\nAnd then came the scene that would haunt many children for weeks.\n\nAbove the crab, something stirred. Long, unnervingly thin arms drifted motionlessly in the dark water. The camera panned up, revealing their source— a Bigfin Squid.\n\nIt floated eerily, its elongated limbs extending into the abyss-like tendrils. The way it moved—slow, deliberate, unnatural—sent shivers down my spine.\n\nThe footage lingered far too long. It was real. Unaltered. Yet, something about it felt wrong.\n\nI wondered who had recorded this for Stephen Hillenburg.\n\nThe screen shifted to a bird’s-eye view of the deep sea. The yellow sponge, pink starfish, and turquoise octopus —the ones from earlier— were drifting downward into the darkness.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/77urr2hsnnye1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=16317a404f8898b689d202e008f9b629931ae4b7\n\nThen, without warning, the film changed.\n\nThe footage became animated.\n\nSpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward were plummeting into the abyss, screaming, before a monstrous, whale-like creature emerged from the darkness. Its gaping mouth, lined with rows of jagged teeth, swallowed them whole.\n\nAs the screen faded to black, Hillenburg delivered his final words:\n\n*“There are places in the ocean humans were never meant to see. Places where light does not reach… and life does not belong.”*\n\nThe broadcast ended.\n\nI sat in silence, trying to process what I had just watched. It wasn’t supernatural. It wasn’t as if it was *cursed,* but something about it felt wrong.\n\nI wanted to record it, but by the time I thought to grab my camera, it was too late. All I managed to capture was the title card.\n\nThe next morning, Nickelodeon was flooded with complaints from horrified parents. Some reported that their children were crying and afraid to take baths. Others questioned why the network had aired something so terrifying. One parent claimed their child had become obsessed with “the spider monster” (the Japanese Spider Crab) and wouldn’t stop drawing it.\n\nViewers had nightmares. Some developed a fear of the ocean.\n\nNickelodeon never acknowledged the broadcast.\n\nExecutives dismissed it as an error. The film was pulled from rotation. No official archives exist. No copies resurfaced. One executive reportedly locked the footage away in a vault, never to be seen again.\n\nBut those who saw it never forgot.\n\nIt wasn’t haunted. It wasn’t cursed.\n\nIt was just real.\n\nAnd sometimes, reality is the scariest thing of all."},"97":{"title":"Looking for specific creepypasta","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kecqm1\/looking_for_specific_creepypasta\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Infinite_Funny1820","selftext":"Hello I'am looking for title of creepypasta; main chracter notices how he and his friends always go sleep early on Christmas Eve, Eventually discovers his parents, and all other families, are using sedatives to make sure no one is awake during that night.

Their pet corgi, Suzie, was the first to start acting strange. She stopped playing and barking at passers-by like she normally did. She became standoffish to her owners, spending most of her time sitting in the corner. Then, one day, Suzie was gone. A hole was dug under my neighbors’ backyard fence with tufts of red hair lodged in the fence’s boards being the only sign of her. They searched the neighborhood, put up flyers, and offered rewards, but Suzie was never found.\n\nMy neighbors swore that Suzie had to have been taken by an animal or person. They insisted she was so happy at home and would never run away. Of course, no one believed them. At least not until it was their dogs.\n\nOver the next year, one by one, dogs started going missing in my neighborhood. Dogs of all shapes and sizes started to disappear without a trace. Some owners said they noticed their dogs acting differently before going missing like Suzie. Others said the dogs just vanished without warning. Then there were the marks. Dogs that would go outside unsupervised would come back with small wounds usually on the legs or neck. Nothing serious mind you, just small scratches just big enough to draw a little blood. Most people thought their dogs got into briars, but after their dogs went missing a few days later, people began crafting theories.\n\nThe community was divided on what was happening. The majority of people believed that a group of coyotes or something was taking the dogs while a slim minority believed the dogs were running away either for some unknown reason or as sheer cosmic coincidence. I didn’t have an opinion. I was just terrified for my dog, Bailey.\n\nBailey was my 6-year-old yellow lab. She was with me for a lot of big moments in my life, my final year of college, moving out of my parents’ house, starting a relationship with my boyfriend, Ross; through the good and bad, Bailey was always by my side, wagging her tail. It might be sad to say, but Bailey had truly been an amazing friend to me over the years, better than most of my real friends. So understandably, I was worried at the idea of losing her like so many others in the neighborhood had with their dogs.\n\nI took every precaution that I could to keep Bailey from disappearing, only walking her on a leash, checking on her as often as I could when she was in the backyard, I even paid a ridiculous amount of money for a special GPS tracking collar that stays on Bailey any time she was outside. I did everything in my power to make sure I wouldn’t lose Bailey, but in the back of my mind, I feared it was inevitable… And then Bailey was gone.\n\nI had looked away for what couldn’t have been 10 minutes. The sun had set an hour before, and Bailey was in the backyard. I needed to handle something in my office for work, so I walked away from the door anticipating being right back but the more I worked in the office the more and more I realized I needed to do. I typed out and sent some emails and when I returned to the back door… Bailey was just gone. I ran out and looked all over the backyard expecting to find a hole leading under the chain-link fence but there was nothing. I paced the perimeter yelling out Bailey’s name desperately when I saw it, a drop of fresh blood at the top of the metal fence. How could this happen? Did Bailey scale the chain-link fence or did something lift her over? If something did lift her over, why didn’t Bailey make any noise? The thoughts raced through my head as I tried to make sense of the situation.\n\nI remembered the tracking collar she was wearing and raced inside to grab my phone and see where she was. I remember the feeling of relief when I opened the app and saw the small paw-print symbol that represented Bailey moving across the map. I could follow her, but she was moving and moving fast.\n\nI grabbed my keys and jumped into my car. I sped through the neighborhood, glancing constantly at the tracking app. I watched as the marker left the neighborhood, crossed the highway into the next neighborhood, and moved quickly to the wood line at the edge of the other neighborhood. Then Bailey’s marker just stopped moving.\n\nMy heart sank and I sped to the end of a cul-de-sac where I could park closest to where the app said Bailey was. I jumped out of my car and awkwardly ran between two houses whose owners I knew nothing about. I knew I looked like a crazy woman running through random people’s backyards, but I figured if someone saw me and asked what I was doing, they would understand my explanation. I ran behind the houses and looked at my phone once more to ensure I was in the right spot.\n\nI looked around and called out for Bailey, expecting her to run out of the bushes, smothering me in kisses with a heavy wagging tail… But no response came. I looked down at the wall of foliage that seemed to seal in the forest beyond it when I noticed a blinking red light in the bushes. I turned on my phone flashlight and slowly approached what I could now see was Bailey's collar lying at the mouth of an animal trail. I knelt down and lifted her collar. The strap was chewed in two and covered in a thick slobber.\n\nI began to cry as the realization set in. Bailey couldn’t have chewed her own collar off. Some other animal would have had to have done it. Some other animal that now had Bailey.\n\nI called Ross. I knew it would be stupid to go into the forest alone, so I called him and told him what had happened and how to get to me. He didn’t complain. He loved Bailey and knew how much she meant to me. He arrived around 20 minutes later.\n\nHe consoled me and let me know that everything was going to be alright. I stood back and called out for Bailey as he searched the wood line for signs of anything else that could help us understand what happened. He was the one to notice the other collars. One by one, Ross shined his flashlight on old worn dog collars. They were all chewed in two like Bailey’s collar. Ross lifted old faded pink collar and looked at the tag.\n\n“Suzie…” he muttered.\n\nI felt both heartbreak and a chilling discomfort. This is where all the dogs went over the year.\n\n“We need to go find Bailey.” I said as I walked towards the opening of the animal trail.\n\n“Woah Woah. No.” Ross whispered, stepping in front of me and placing his hand out in blocking my path. “We aren’t going in there right now.”\n\n“What are you talking about.” I snapped at him. “Bailey’s in there. Something has her!”\n\nRoss placed his hands on my shoulder, his grip tightening as he spoke.\n\n“I know… I know… but something’s not right, Jess. The collars… Bailey’s collar… Look,” Ross lifted Bailey’s collar, “there’s no blood. If something dragged her all the way from your house to these woods as fast as you described, then why the hell is there no blood on the collar?”\n\n“The fence,” I whispered, “there was blood on the fence.”\n\n“A drop. She probably got it when she was climbing the fence.” He paused and hung his head. “I’m not saying something didn’t bring her out here. I don’t know what could have happened and I don’t want to sound like an asshole, but if something did what you’re thinking, going into the woods after it at night could end really really badly.”\n\n“So, we’re supposed to just leave her to get killed?”\n\nRoss looked at me with sorrow filled eyes as I came to the realization he already had. If something took Bailey into the woods with the intention of killing her, Bailey would already be dead by now.\n\nRoss pulled me close as I began to sob, his embrace being the only thing that kept me from collapsing to the floor. As strange as it might be to say, Bailey was my closest companion besides Ross. The idea of her just being gone in an instant filled me with indescribable grief.\n\nRoss and I went back to my house. He insisted on staying the night, an offer I accepted. He comforted me on the couch as I recounted all the things I could have done to prevent this from happening. How I was an idiot for all the mistakes I made. He pet my hair and told me that I was being too hard on myself. Ross said that hindsight always makes us look like fools but that all we can do is our best in the present. His voice was always comforting to me.\n\n“What are we going to do?” I whispered.\n\n“As soon as the sun’s up. I’ll go out there and try to find her.” Ross replied.\n\n“I’m coming with you.”\n\n“I don’t know if that’s a good idea, Jess. We could find her and she… It could be bad.”\n\nI gripped his hand as tears filled my eyes.\n\n“I don’t care, Ross. She’s out there. She’s my responsibility. I’m going to help find her.”\n\nRoss was hesitant but eventually relinquished.\n\nI didn’t sleep that night. Every time I tried my mind would be flooded with images of Bailey, her body ripped apart, mangled and broken beyond recognition. After what felt like an eternity of torment, I began to see sunlight shine through the curtains.\n\nWe were back at the wood line around 40 minutes later. This time we had to explain to the homeowner what we were doing since he saw us parked in front of his yard as he was leaving for work.\n\n“It seems like everyone’s dogs are going missing here recently.” The homeowner said, trying to make small talk. “My wife’s always been a cat person, so I guess we don’t have to worry about it.”\n\n“So, is it ok if we cut through to get into the forest?” Ross asked.\n\n“Yeah, of course.” the homeowner replied. “I hope y’all find your dog. But be careful out there. It gets hot this time of year so be sure not to get lost.”\n\n“Yes sir.” Ross replied before heading with me to the wood line.\n\nWe stood staring at the green wall that obstructed the view into the forest. Looking into the mouth of the animal trail. It looked smaller than it did the night before.\n\n“You sure want to be here for this, Jess?” Ross asked, squeezing my hand.\n\n“Yeah. Let’s go.” I replied as I stepped into the lush forest.\n\nFor the first 20 feet or so, the green wall of the forest did everything it could to keep me and Ross out. I thought using the animal trail would have made things easier and I suppose it did but only a bit. Truthfully, all the trail did at the start was provide a direction. The path was still covered in greenbriers and thorns. After what felt like minutes of scrapes and cuts, we broke through the other side of the wall and the forest seemed to open up.\n\nBeyond the green wall laid a beautiful open forest covered in large oak trees that stretched up like pillars that held a dense roof of leaves, shading us from the hot sun. The cooler air feeling pleasant on my skin. Despite the beauty of nature, my mind was wholly fixed on finding Bailey. I yelled out her name again and again as Ross knelt down and rummaged through his backpack. I looked back just in time to see him pull out a small machete from his pack.\n\n“You’re only taking that out now?” I huffed.\n\n“It’s not for the plants.” He muttered as his eyes scanned the forest.\n\nI looked back and scanned the empty forest floor with him. I wanted to find Bailey alive and well, but the possibility of some other animal killing her and all the other dogs could still have been a very real possibility. I walked into the forest hoping for the best, but I needed to be prepared for the worst.\n\nWe followed the winding animal trail through the forest. Neither of us were super outdoorsy people so walking through the forest without a proper walking trail took some getting used to. After a bit of walking, our strides became more confident and we moved faster down the trail, calling out for Bailey and scanning for any movement. After what was probably 45 minutes of walking our noses were accosted by a horrid smell.\n\nThe stench of a rotting animal is something I feel most people can recognize. Even if you’ve only smelled it once in your life, it’s one of those smells that seems primally linked to our brains in order to instantly recognize it.\n\nThe first time I smelled rot was when a raccoon died under my parents’ house before I moved out. The stench filled every room and made it feel like you were unable to breathe. Bailey was the one to find the source of the smell. I found her using her puppy paws to dig at the floor in the bathroom. When Dad went under the house, the raccoon was lying right under where Bailey was digging. She was praised and given tons of treats for the useful hint.\n\nI took a step back and covered my nose before my heart sank with fear of what I was smelling. Without thinking, I began jogging down the animal trail towards the smell, my eyes watering as the images of Bailey I imagined that night flashed through my head once more.\n\n“Jess! Stop!” Ross yelled out as I heard his heavy footsteps chasing behind me.\n\nThe forest opened even more. A large live oak stretched huge branches out like a massive upside-down octopus, creating a wide area free of trees or shrubs. The stench was debilitating now, I put the collar of my shirt up over my nose to breathe as Ross came into the clearing behind me. I walked to the middle of the open area, scanning for the source of the smell. When my eyes finally locked onto it, I gagged and turned away.\n\nIt was a deer… what was left of a deer. The poor thing was picked apart. The meat on its front and back legs were gone. Most of its face was picked off. The animal’s stomach was ripped open, and its guts were spilled out on the forest floor and clearly chewed on. Its whole body was covered in different-sized bite marks, both large and small. Flys and maggots swarmed the carcass.\n\nI turned back towards the oak tree in the center of the clearing, I couldn’t bare to look at the mutilated deer any longer. Ross stepped closer to the animal to assess its wounds and try to make out what happened. I pulled out my phone and opened the maps app to see where we were in the forest. As I looked down at my phone, I heard Ross’ shaky voice call out to me.\n\n“Jess.” He said in a voice that seemed torn on whether to yell or whisper.\n\nI looked back to see Ross staring to my right, back in the direction we entered the clearing. I turned my head and was taken aback by what I saw, dogs.\n\nI didn’t count them, but it had to be 10 to 15 of them. All different breeds and sizes. I even noticed what I believed were a few foxes and coyotes. My eyes fell low to see a small, dirty corgi amongst the taller breeds that I instantly recognized as Suzie. My eyes then shot up as a familiar white coat stepped from the bushes, it was Bailey.\n\nShe looked the same as she did when I lost her the day before. Her ears were perked and her brow furrowed as though she was looking at something she didn’t understand.\n\n“Bailey?” I whispered.\n\nBailey’s tail began to wag and she slowly stepped forward, stretching her neck out as though she was approaching a stranger. I knelt down and put my two hands out towards her.\n\n“Bailey, it’s me, sweetheart.” I cooed. “Come here. Let’s get you home.”\n\nThe closer Bailey got, the more deliberate her steps became. A sense of unease fell over me as her back hunched down and she moved in an almost stalking motion.\n\n“Jess,” Ross whispered, “I think you should-”\n\nBefore he had finished speaking, Bailey lunged forward, jaws snapping at my hands. The phone in my hand fell to the floor as I stammered back and screamed. I kicked my legs as Bailey bit at my feet, my arms being the only thing keeping me up. In an instant, Ross raced in front of me, kicking Bailey hard in the side, causing her to fall back onto her side.\n\n“Get up, Jess! Get up!” he yelled as he pulled me to my feet.\n\nThe other dogs were showing aggression now, barking violently, baring teeth, and forming a semi-circle around us with our backs to the live oak in the middle of the clearing. Ross stood in front of me, swinging the machete wildly at any dog that got too close to us. I watched as Bailey stood to her feet before joining the pack in cornering us.\n\n“I need you to climb up the tree!” Ross said.\n\n“What?” I replied in a daze.\n\n“Climb the tree where they can’t get you!”  he shouted. “I’ll make sure you're safe and follow you up once you’re in the tree!”\n\nI turned my back and began trying to pull myself up onto the large tree. I could hear the dogs become more aggressive as my back was turned, as well as hearing Ross become louder as he fought harder to fend the animals off. Eventually, I found a grip on the tree and pulled myself onto its large branches.\n\n“Ok!” I cried out. “I’m up! Get up here!”\n\nFor a few moments, Ross would briefly glance back at the tree, trying to determine the best way up. Each time he would look away, the pack of dogs would inch closer, forcing Ross to look back at them and swing the machete to keep their gnashing jaws at bay. Eventually, he had his path marked out.\n\n“Alright,” he said, “Move over. I’m coming up.”\n\nI moved down the branch.\n\nRoss swung the machete one last time in a wide swing before quickly turning and jumping onto the tree. He pushed himself up the trunk of the tree, but his footing slipped and he threw his arms over the branch I was sitting on, throwing the machete as he struggled to get a grip on the branch. His lower half dangled over the edge. I grabbed his shirt and pulled while his feet kicked against the trunk of the tree, trying to get traction.\n\nHis legs scraped and slipped against the tree; his voice groaned as he attempted to pull himself up. I watched in horror as two large dogs from the pack ran up and bit down on his calves. Ross screamed and I heard the sound of cloth tearing as the dogs shook their heads violently. I looked down and screamed as I saw blood seep through Ross’ pant legs and run over the mouths of the persistent dogs. I pulled harder on him, but the added weight made it impossible for me to lift him. I cried out as I watched Ross’ grip falter before seeing his body pulled down from the tree.\n\nHe landed on his back hard, letting out a breathy wheeze as his body made contact with the ground. The pack of dogs were over him in an instant, converting his sharp breath to unimaginable screams of pain. They bit and tore at his body, ripping clothes and flesh alike. The larger dogs focused in at his arms and leg, I could hear his bones popping and breaking as they tore at his flailing limbs. The smaller dogs like Suzie and the foxes seemed to pick at his stomach and chest with a ferocity that made it look like they were trying to crawl inside his still-living body. And then there was Bailey.\n\nBailey was attacking Ross’ face and neck with the help of a border collie I remember going missing a few months ago. She tore at his face with brutal ferocity, staining her white coat a mess of red and pink. His close screams did nothing to deter her from removing strips of flesh from his face. She ripped at his face with hallow eyes that showed no compassion or recognition for the man I loved, a man whose arms Bailey had slept in countless times.\n\nI screamed and cried, begging for them to stop. I broke small branches from the tree and threw them at the animals, but it did nothing to deter them from their meal. For a moment, Bailey looked up at me with the same emotionless expression and snarled before ripping off Ross’ ear. It was at that moment where my mind truly grasped what I had witnessed. Bailey was no longer the sweet loving dog I once knew and cared for, none of these dogs were. They had all been turned into this pack of ravenous wild dogs that view us no different than the deer they devoured. Ross had stopped screaming by then, whether it was because he died of his wounds, or his body had gone into shock I don’t think I’ll ever know. By the time they were done, I could no longer recognize him as the man I had planned my future with.\n\nOnce they were finished, the dogs looked up at me in the tree. Occasionally they would bark and snarl at me, their blood and slobber-filled mouths making a disgusting sloshing sound as they licked their lips. We stayed like this for probably around two hours, the radiant heat of the summer air paired with the stress and lack of water caused me to feel as though I would pass out. Eventually, the dogs seemed to give up. All together, they ran into the forest and out of my site. I cried as they left; I wanted them to go away, but the idea of not knowing where they were was even more terrifying at that moment.\n\nI spent the next few hours sitting in the tree looking for any sign of the dogs in the forest, focusing on every twig and leaf that moved in the wind, every fleeting shadow a possible threat. I tried making sense of the situation but there was none. Could it be rabies? But rabies doesn’t make animals join a pack. Could the dogs have just hated us all along? No, I knew Bailey, she loved us. She would never be violent. She has to be sick. Some kind of illness that causes them to act like this. Something we don’t understand. After I was confident the coast was clear, I spent the next hour trying to build the courage to leave the tree.\n\nThe ground felt unstable as my feet met the forest floor. My eyes flickered between scanning the surrounding forest and looking at Ross’ mangled remains. I knelt down next to him, unable to stand. My eyes watered as I looked at the pained expression left on what remained of his face. My hand hovered over him, but I couldn’t bring myself to touch him.\n\nEvery step through the forest was filled with agonizing dread. With every crunching leaf under my foot, I could envision myself being ripped apart by Bailey and the other dogs, ending up just like Ross. I wanted to cry for the entire walk; I wanted to scream for my loss, but I held in the noise. I didn’t know these woods, the only way I knew to get out was to go back the way we came. I didn’t want to follow the trail we took to get out of the forest, knowing that it was created by the pack, but I had no other choice. It felt like the trail stretched on for an eternity, but eventually, I could see a dense green wall in the distance.\n\nA sharp breath entered my lungs as my eyes could see the end of the forest. Through the small gaps in the green wall, I could see glimpses of houses, glimpses of safety. I began to jog, tears rolling down my face, a swelling relief filling my heart. The illusion was so sweet, but so easily broken by the sound of a low, rumbling growl.\n\nI turned to my left to see the border collie hunched down stalking at me slowly, a second smaller mutt behind him. The dogs were still drenched in blood, the collie’s dirty matted fur a sign of its longer experience in the forest. I glanced around, it seemed the rest of the pack was somewhere else. I screamed at the animals in hopes that it would scare them away, but the two continued their approach with teeth bared. I screamed again, a plea for help this time, hoping someone from outside the forest would hear my cries and come to help, but there was no reply.\n\nI sprinted for the green wall, seeing it as my only opportunity to escape. I knew my chances of outrunning the dogs were slim, but even I was taken by surprise at the border collie’s speed.\n\nI looked away for only a second to run, and in that short time, the border collie closed the distance on me, biting down on my hand. My body spun around as the dog dug its paws into the ground and shook its head. I cried out in pain as I saw and felt the flesh on my hand tear against the dog’s gnawing teeth, my blood dripping from its mouth. I grabbed the animals top jaw and twisted and pulled my arm to try and get it to release. The dog repositioned its head so now my mangled hand was fully in its mouth, the dog’s canines digging into my wrist. I looked up to see the other dog circling us slowly, preparing to lunge. I was going to die.\n\nAs a final act of desperation, I agonizingly flexed my mauled hand in the beast’s mouth, grabbing hold of its pulsing, viscous tongue and sinking my fingernails into it. The dog yelped in a way that sounded more like a scream as I dug my fingers deeper, my palm filling with a warm liquid. The mutt that was circling lifted his head and stammered back, seemingly disturbed by his friend’s cries. The border collie released my hand and drew back, crying and swatting at its mouth with its front paws. The hurt dog hung its head and opened its mouth, deep red blood pouring from its maw. The animals looked at me with fear, realizing I wouldn’t be an easy meal without the rest of the pack. I screamed and stomped at them. The two dogs tucked their tails and sprinted back into the forest, out of my sight.\n\nSeizing the opportunity, I turned and sprinted through the green wall. My arms and legs were cut to hell by all the sharp thorns and vines, but it was nothing compared to what I had just been through. I broke through to the outside and breathed in heavily as I took in the open air.\n\nThe rest of the day was a blur, crying, police sirens, gunshots, a hospital. They scoured the woods. Not just to find Ross’ body, but to kill every dog that they could. I remember them showing me pictures of the bodies of the dogs they had killed for me to identify, eight dogs. They had killed the border collie and Suzie, a few mutts, a coyote, even a French bulldog I don’t remember seeing in the group. Eight dogs… I know there were more. Even still, Bailey wasn’t amongst the dead. I told the police such and they insisted they would keep looking, but no other dogs were found.\n\nEverything changed that day for me. It has been a little over a month and I’m not the same. I don’t want to see people or talk to them. I look down at my scared hand and cast and I am reminded of the horrors of that day. I catch myself just staring off into space, thinking about Bailey. I believed that my seclusion was a symptom of the PTSD I received from the event… but I know better now.\n\nI can’t give an exact moment when the feeling started. It seemed to creep into my subconscious and grow out of control there, just like it did to all of them… longing. Longing for the forest, longing for Bailey, longing for all the dogs, just as they long for me. I can’t hear them, but I can feel them, every one of them. They call out to me in my soul.\n\nI know that I’m sick. I don’t know how, but I think I have whatever it is that the missing dogs have. I’ve begun to see them, the pack. In my neighborhood, in my yard, in my house, they’re everywhere. The others can’t see them, but I do. They like to hide in the bushes, behind corners, just out of sight, but I see them. They just look at me and beckon for me to join them. To follow them into the peace and comfort of the forest and the loving embrace of the pack. Their voices are so beautiful.\n\nToday, I saw Bailey sitting on the other side of my fence in the backyard. She stared into my soul with her beautiful brown eyes, the fur on her head and chest stained slightly pink. My eyes watered and tears streamed down my face. She stood to her feet and gave me one last passing glance as she walked away.\n\nI’ll follow her."},"99":{"title":"The Cannibals of the Mountains","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kdxs7s\/the_cannibals_of_the_mountains\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"dorimarcosta","selftext":"\n\nRenato and I were hanging by a thread. The fast-paced life in São Paulo had drained us: our patience, our humor—even our silence. Everything was noise, lines, traffic, pressure. So when we saw that ad on the vacation rental website, it felt like a sign. *“Rustic house high up in the mountains, perfect for those seeking peace and isolation.”* Exactly what we needed.\n\nThe drive there was long and bumpy. By the time we left the asphalt and hit the dirt road, the sun was already beginning to set. We passed through thick forest, a few abandoned fields, and then... nothing. No houses, no human sounds. Just the wind and the song of birds I had never heard before.\n\nThe house was older than the pictures had shown, but it had a certain charm—sloped red-tile roof, wooden porch, a collapsed fence on one side. I opened the door and the smell hit right away: damp wood mixed with something else... hard to describe. A musty scent, like cloth stored in a basement. Renato made a joke, calling it “the smell of peace and quiet.”\n\nInside, the house was simple. A living room with an old couch, thick rug, a small kitchen with white cabinets. The bedrooms were upstairs, but one thing caught my eye immediately: an old, solid wood cabinet that didn’t match the others, which were modern and metallic. The wall behind it stood out too. It didn’t match the rest of the kitchen. It was wooden, while the others were made of brick and mortar. I ran my hand over it out of curiosity.  \n— “Weird wall,” I said to Renato.  \n— “You and your horror movies,” he laughed.  \nI let it go. It was just a wall.\n\nThat first night was quiet, which alone made the whole drive worth it. Used to horns, sirens, and street yelling, the forest silence was almost deafening. We went to bed early.\n\nI woke the next morning with *that feeling*. You know the one—like someone’s watching you, even when no one’s there. I went to the kitchen to make coffee and stepped onto the porch in my pajamas, trying to shake off the weight in my chest with the smell of trees and earth.\n\nThat’s when I noticed the footprints.  \nIn the soft dirt by the side of the house—human footprints. They led up to the living room window... and stopped. They didn’t return. Didn’t go further. Just stopped, as if whoever made them had vanished into thin air.  \nI called Renato. He tried to laugh it off.  \n— “Probably the caretaker.”  \n— “There is no caretaker.”  \n— “Maybe from an old guest.”  \nBut the prints were fresh. The earth was still dark and damp. Hard to ignore.\n\nThat night, we locked everything up. I checked the doors and windows twice. A third time, just to be sure.\n\nAt two in the morning, I woke up to a low sound coming from the kitchen. A slow creaking. Like a door being opened very carefully.\n\nI called Renato. He got up to check. Came back saying everything was fine—but I knew better. A small voice inside me told me to stay alert.\n\n \n\nThe next day, after breakfast, Renato and I decided to explore the area around the house. The mist still clung to the woods, but gradually, the sun tore through the white veil and revealed the landscape: hills covered in low brush, a few twisted trees, and a silence broken only by birdsong.\n\nIt was beautiful, I won’t lie. A silence that seeped into your skin. We walked slowly, hand in hand, saying little. It felt like the whole place was waiting for us to be quiet—to listen better.\n\nAfter about forty minutes of walking, we saw the “neighbor’s house” the ad had mentioned—the only one for miles, according to the owner. An old structure with mud walls and a crooked roof. There was a low fence and a wooden gate hanging by one hinge.\n\nThat’s when I saw him.\n\nA boy. Skinny, maybe 17 at most. Worn-out shirt, pants too big, dark hair falling across his face. He stood at the edge of the woods, about twenty yards from the house. Not moving. Just watching us.  \n— “You see him?” I asked.  \n— “Yeah. Is he... staring at us?” Renato squeezed my hand.\n\nThe boy didn’t say anything. Didn’t move. Just stared with an intensity that sent chills through me. It wasn’t curiosity. It felt like he was studying us.\n\nI felt exposed. Like we were naked in that landscape. The discomfort rose so fast we didn’t even need to speak—we turned and walked back the same way. Not running, but not looking back either.\n\nWhen the house appeared between the trees, my heart jumped. The door. It was slightly open.  \n— “Did you lock it?” I asked, already knowing the answer.  \n— “Yes.”\n\nWe approached slowly. The kitchen light was on. I swear I’d turned everything off before we left. Renato went in first. I stayed by the door, holding my breath.\n\nNothing seemed out of place. The living room looked the same, backpacks in the same corner. But something... I can’t explain.\n\nRenato searched every room, opened cabinets, looked behind doors. Nothing. No sign of a break-in.\n\nBut the feeling didn’t go away. The same one I’d had the night before. Like something in that house was watching us.\n\nAnd worse: now it knew we knew.\n\n \n\nThat night, I woke up with a start. The mattress was moving slowly. When I opened my eyes, I saw Renato getting up, stepping carefully on the wooden floor.\n\n— “Renato... what is it?” I murmured, still half-asleep.\n\nHe paused for a second, then whispered:  \n— “I think I heard something downstairs.”\n\nMy stomach dropped. I sat up, straining to hear what he had. Nothing. Just silence. But the way he said it killed any urge I had to argue.\n\nWe grabbed our jackets and went down slowly, one step at a time. When we turned the hallway corner, the kitchen light was on again.\n\nStanding at the edge of the room, it took us a few seconds to notice. Renato pointed at the floor, eyes wide. The floor was full of marks. Footprints. He knelt down and ran his hand across the dirty tiles.  \n— “Is this... mud?” I whispered.  \nThe muddy prints led straight to the wooden cabinet—the oldest one in the kitchen.  \nThe trail stopped there. “This doesn’t make sense,” he muttered. I said nothing, just scanned the room, feeling that deep, cold fear you only feel when something’s *really* wrong.\n\nRenato slowly opened the cabinet, expecting... who knows what. But there was nothing—just plates, old pans, some cans of corn.  \nCarefully, he began tapping the sides of the cabinet with his knuckles. Solid wood... until he hit the back. The sound changed. Hollow.\n\nHe looked at me. “There’s something here.” That’s when we saw it—a barely noticeable groove in the wall beside it. He pulled hard and the wooden panel creaked, revealing a short door with a rusty old latch. Renato reached for it. “Don’t open it yet,” I said instinctively. “Let’s think. Let’s call someone…”\n\nRenato froze, hand still on the latch, as if struggling inside. I didn’t want to seem hysterical, but everything in me screamed *do not go further*. That’s when we heard it—a sound like a woman screaming.\n\n \n\nRenato yanked the latch. It cracked like a dry bone snapping. The door opened a few inches with a groan, and a strong smell rushed out. Something between stagnant water and rotting flesh. I recoiled instinctively, covering my face. My stomach turned.\n\nRenato turned on his phone’s flashlight and pointed it inside. It was a tunnel. Narrow, damp, the walls supported by wooden beams, lined with uneven stones and moss. The floor was dirt and mud, with fresh footprints mixed into the muck. It didn’t look like a basement—more like a coal mine.\n\n“This isn’t normal, Renato.” My voice was trembling. He nodded, but looked hypnotized. He crouched and went in, and I followed. The light swung across the walls like it was revealing secrets that didn’t want to be seen.\n\nThe tunnel branched off underground. We followed the one that spiraled downward for a few yards, ending at a wooden door reinforced with beams and chains. On the floor were marks, as if something heavy had been dragged to that spot. The air smelled stronger there—almost unbearable.\n\nRenato ran his hand along the doorknob. Locked. But there was a small gap between the door and the frame. He brought the flashlight closer, and I leaned beside him to peek inside.\n\nAnd that’s when we saw, for the first time, proof that something horrifying had happened there.\n\nThere were remains. Bones. Some small, others far too big to belong to animals. Torn fabric stained with dried blood. A chain hanging from a hook in the wall. A rusty bucket in the corner. We had no idea how long we stood there, paralyzed. But when we finally turned to go back through the tunnel—guided only by the weak phone flashlight—we were horrified to discover the passage we came through... was now closed.\n\n \n\nSomething heavy was blocking the path. Renato pushed hard, but it was useless.  \n\"What do we do now?\" I whispered, barely able to speak.  \nBefore he could answer, we heard voices coming from the dark tunnels behind us. Twisted laughter and the sound of footsteps in the mud. Renato turned off the flashlight, and we stood still in total darkness, listening to our own hearts pounding too loud.  \nWhen they noticed our presence, they began to shout and run toward us.  \nWithout thinking, we bolted through the tunnel, stumbling and hitting the dirt walls. We ran blind, guided only by the instinct to survive, trying to escape the maddened voices that seemed to close in from every side.\n\nThat’s when we found another door. Old wood, the lock nearly rotted through. We knocked, pushed, but it seemed locked. Behind us, the voices drew closer.  \nThe door creaked and suddenly opened. A small room, stinking of mold and rot. And inside, almost invisible in the dim light, was the boy we’d seen outside — thin, filthy, eyes wide open. Without a word, he made a quick gesture for silence.  \nWe rushed inside, and he quietly closed the door, sliding a piece of wood across it to act as a lock. From the other side, we heard our pursuers arrive and start banging, trying to break it down.  \nThe boy pointed to another exit — a trapdoor hidden under a pile of torn clothes.  \nWith hurried gestures, he guided us. We crawled through a tight passage that led into the kitchen of the house. There, we saw a woman — his mother, I assumed — with her back to us, cooking something on a wood stove. She was humming a children’s song off-key, unaware of our presence.\n\nWith quiet steps, we crossed the room. The boy opened the back door. The cold night air hit us like a slap. And we escaped into the yard, running without looking back.  \nHe stayed at the threshold, motionless, watching as we disappeared into the darkness.\n\nWe ran through the yard, not looking back. The tall grass cut our legs, branches scratched our arms, but the only thing that mattered was getting out. Renato chose not to turn on his phone flashlight again so we wouldn't give away our position. The moonlight barely lit the path, but even in the dark we could see our car parked at the front of the house, just as we’d left it.  \nRenato pulled the keys from his pocket and tried to unlock the car, but it didn’t work.  \n\"Damn it…\" he muttered, pressing the button over and over.  \nThat’s when we noticed all four tires were slashed and the hood was slightly open — the battery was gone. They wanted to keep us trapped.\n\nThe voices and footsteps were getting closer. We could clearly hear more than one — several — coming toward us. They shouted nonsense, some laughing like kids playing tag.  \n\"Run! Run!\" Renato yelled.  \nWe left the car and dove into the dense underbrush, heading the opposite way from the voices. The cold night air burned our lungs with each frantic breath. Thorns tore our clothes, but the adrenaline kept us from feeling any pain.  \nAfter what felt like an eternity of blind running, we saw something ahead: metal structures reflecting the faint light. As we got closer, we saw what it was — an empty lot filled with old, abandoned cars swallowed by weeds.  \nWe didn’t think twice. We began opening doors, trying to find a vehicle that could still save us.\n\nMost were just junk: rust, rotted seats, broken steering wheels.  \nThen Renato whispered, \"Here! This one!\"  \nIt was an old car, but intact. And miraculously, the key was still in the ignition.  \nWithout hesitation, he turned the key. The engine coughed once, twice… then caught, sputtering but alive.  \nAs Renato revved the engine to keep it going, I saw through the broken windows of the junkyard — shadows approaching. Three of them, running, waving their arms like rabid animals.  \n\"Go! Go! Go!\" I shouted.  \nRenato floored it. The car jerked forward, bumping into old shells of metal and wood. As we reached the dirt road, we could already see some of the pursuers coming out of the brush, their faces twisted with rage.\n\nWe left that hell behind. The house, the tunnel, the pursuers — all disappearing in the rearview mirror, swallowed by the darkness. But the car didn’t make it much farther. The engine died, leaving us stranded in the middle of the woods and night. Still, it was far enough to get away from that nightmare.\n\nAfter hours of walking through the forest, exhausted, filthy, and still terrified, we finally reached the main road. We flagged down the first car we saw, and the driver, seeing our condition, didn’t hesitate to take us to the nearest police station.  \nSitting under the cold lights of the lobby, we recounted everything we had been through: the isolated house, the tunnels, the pursuers, the mute boy who helped us. As we spoke, the officers exchanged glances — some serious, others with a mix of disbelief and unease.  \nDespite everything, they agreed to go with us to the place, now in broad daylight, to verify our story.\n\nWe arrived at the house, now bathed in sunlight. From a distance, it looked like just another old farmhouse. But as the officers inspected the area, they began to find signs: trails, debris, fresh marks in the dirt.  \nInside, the scene showed signs of a rushed abandonment — still-warm pots, clothes strewn about, inner doors flung open. In the tunnels, the officers found disturbing evidence: personal belongings from several people, IDs, broken phones, torn clothes.  \nOne of the officers muttered while examining the items:  \n\"We’ve suspected that family for years... The Hobolds.\"  \nThey explained that the family, of German descent, had long been investigated for the disappearances of tourists in the region, but there had never been enough proof. Now, with our testimony and the evidence found, they could finally act.\n\nAs I got into the police car, I looked back one last time. For a moment, I thought I saw the silhouette of the mute boy at the window, watching us. I felt a bitter mix of relief and sorrow. He had saved us... but was still trapped in that nightmare."},"191":{"title":"Incomplete thesis","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ke7nb1\/incomplete_thesis\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"ConstantDiamond4627","selftext":"I had been sleeping poorly. For weeks, perhaps since the house became empty and human voices vanished from its hallways. But that night was different. I dreamt something I haven't been able to forget, even though I've tried with methods more rational than poetic. Something that clung to my body like a pungent smell, like a subcutaneous hum.\n\nIn the dream, I was part of a hive. I wasn't observing the bees. I was one of them. But not like a human disguised as an insect, not with fake antennae or an anthropomorphized body. I was a bee in its entirety: its sensory field, its exoskeleton, its consciousness divided between individual will and collective impulse. Everything vibrated. Everything smelled. Everything moved in patterns I understood without comprehending.\n\nThe hive wasn't a common honeycomb. It didn't hang from a branch or hide in a natural cavity. It was... organic, yes, but also in another way. The hexagons seemed to pulse, moist, as if they were breathing. They opened and closed with a cadence reminiscent of an animal's diaphragm while asleep. The walls were covered with a warm, gelatinous substance that wasn't wax or honey, but something like flesh. And the worst: the sound. A choral hum, like thousands of thoughts stitched together, but suddenly distorted, as if something or someone was trying to speak through it. They weren't words; it felt more like an intention, a presence using the hum as a mouth.\n\nI tried to move, to fly. But the wings didn't obey. I felt a larva inside me, not literally, but as if I were incubating something, as if that hive didn't contain me but was forming me from within. Then something changed. I began to understand the pattern of the hum. As if the pheromones crossing the air were also syntax, the language of the swarm. And what they said, what they repeated over and over, was a question directed toward a specific cell of the hive that didn't seem made to contain honey or a larva. It was a different cell, covered with black wax, as if it were charred. The other bees avoided it, but I didn't. I was drawn to it, as if it were mine, as if it belonged to me, I felt it was mine. I crawled over the surface of the honeycomb, and when I touched that cell, the hum ceased, and I heard a word, a single one. Not a name. Not a verb. A word that in the dream was perfectly understandable, although now only its resonance remains, like a wet silhouette on a fogged mirror.\n\nI woke up drenched in sweat, my mouth dry, my nails dug into the palms of my hands. An invisible hum lingered behind my ears, like the echo of something that doesn't belong to the dream or wakefulness. I didn't remember that word, but everything else was fresh in my memory; I could recount it perfectly, as I am doing now. The only thing I didn't remember and still don't is that word. I shook myself a bit before getting out of bed; that had been the strangest and craziest dream I'd ever had—well, a dream I remembered.\n\nAt that time, I was a biology student, about to finish my degree; only the graduation requirement remained. I had decided to work on a thesis instead of doing an internship. Why? I don't even know; if I had taken the other option, maybe none of what happened afterward would have occurred, and I wouldn't have ended up medicated. My thesis focused on the sensory allometry of Apis mellifera, the honey bees. Hence the reason for that dream; it's not that in the realm of Morpheus I had become an expert on bees. I was fascinated by the precision of their bodies, the way the growth of their sensory organs relates to body size. Everything could be measured. Graphed. Understood. I suppose I was attracted to precision itself.\n\nI lived in an old university house, in a city I prefer not to name. The walls were always damp and smelled of old books. Before the 2020 pandemic, eight students lived there. Each in their room, sharing coffee, insomnia, laughter, and existential crises. But when the quarantine began, everyone returned to their homes. Everyone had a place to go back to, except me. I stayed alone... six months locked in that house, surviving on delivery food and sporadic video calls. At first, solitude was a luxury. Not having to share the kitchen, the bathroom, the laundry. Not hearing doors closing or other people's footsteps. But over time, the silence mutated. It became thick, like a substance. I spoke with my advisor once a week. Sometimes I exchanged messages with Alejandra, a friend from my program who was also writing from her city, with her parents, with other humans, unlike me. The rest was silence, hums, and the sound old things make when they think no one is listening.\n\nThere, amid routine and isolation, the boundary between the real and... the other began to blur. It all started with a file. One morning, while reviewing a fragment of the morphometric analysis of Apis mellifera worker bees, I noticed a sentence I didn't remember writing: \"Compound eyes are an architecture of surveillance. Each segment watches, records, and remembers.\" I deleted it, assuming I had copied it by mistake from some neuroethology article. But the next day, there was another new sentence: \"The queen watches even when she sleeps.\" I decided to change the file's password, made a copy on a USB, and another in the cloud. I started reviewing the change history; clearly, no one else had accessed the computer... I repeat, I was alone.\n\nI simply attributed everything to fatigue, loneliness, the pandemic, and the latent stress of dying and still having to pretend normality and continue with our lives, continue working on a thesis to graduate and have opportunities in a future I didn't know if it would come.\n\nHowever, things didn't adopt a tone of sanity despite being aware of the probable alteration of reality that my mind might be suffering. One day, a jar of honey appeared on the kitchen table. It had no label, and I hadn't ordered it... at least I didn't remember buying it. I wasn't a honey enthusiast; sometimes I used it to sweeten the teas I drank, but now I lived 80% thanks to coffee, so it wasn't possible that I had made that purchase. The honey had a darker color than commercial honey and a slightly metallic smell. I decided to try it; maybe it was a jar of the honey we had extracted in the lab, the one that had been gifted to the university's administrative staff and deans. Its taste was strange, like old wood; it wasn't pleasant, and I didn't know where it came from; maybe one of the guys who lived with me had forgotten it. So I threw the jar away, but... it reappeared.\n\nI remembered wrapping the jar in paper towels and throwing it in the trash can. However, the next morning, that jar was intact on the kitchen counter again. I wrote to Alejandra to tell her what was happening to me; I had already told her about the sentences I didn't remember writing, and she, like me, attributed it to stress, but this? Alejandra, worried about my increasingly erratic messages, offered to come visit me, and I accepted with relief. She had a special permit to move around the city since she, along with other microbiologists, was working in the university's laboratories with samples from people infected with the pandemic disease, to determine if there was contagion or not. It was an offer made by our university due to the pandemic status the disease had reached worldwide. When she arrived, she hugged me as if I had been sick.\n\n\"When was the last time you went out to the garden?\" she asked me.\n\n\"A week ago,\" I replied.\n\nBut when we opened the back door, we found a completely different garden. Darker, with trees I didn't recognize. As if they had aged decades in a few months. That garden was completely neglected; even when there were more people, there were only weeds acting as yellowish grass, seedlings that wouldn't get far, and even two trees that hadn't changed much in the time I'd been living in that house, and that had been almost five years. I didn't say anything, not because what I was seeing or feeling was a lie, but because Alejandra didn't. She knew that house; we had gone many times to hang out there, to drink, to read; she had even brought her dog Haru. If she didn't notice any difference, then... what was happening to me? Damn stress.\n\nThe last night, while Alejandra slept in my room, I went down to the improvised lab I had set up in the old library. The bees were restless, as their hum was more intense and, at the same time, more harmonious. When I approached the aquarium that was supposed to be a hive, I saw that with their bodies they had formed a precise figure: an incomplete hexagon. The same one that had appeared in the thesis, in my dreams. Then something crossed my mind, that maybe there was no difference between my study, my thoughts, and the hive. In my mind, there was a certainty, a certainty that something had opened... something was using me to write. That's why random sentences, sentences I didn't remember thinking or writing, appeared in my documents, in my thesis draft; it had to be that.\n\nThe truth is, I'm not sure if that's what really happened. Maybe it was all a symptom of confinement, of loneliness. Maybe it still is. Over time, the confinement ended. Not overnight, of course, but the authorities relaxed the measures, the university reopened gradually, and some voices returned to the hallways. Alejandra returned to the city; we saw each other one afternoon, in silence, after months of out-of-sync messages and video calls with poor connection. She asked me if I was okay, and I said yes. We both knew it was a lie, but neither wanted to correct the other.\n\nThe thesis was submitted. I remember the strange weight of having it printed in my hands. \"Sensory allometry in Apis mellifera during early larval development and its possible relation to caste differentiation.\" A technical, clean, neat title. Nothing in that title alluded to the vertigo I felt while writing it, nor to the paranoia that grew like mold between the folds of confinement. The defense was virtual; they congratulated me, and I remember one of the jurors used the word \"solid.\" Everything was solid, firm, scientific, rational. And yet, when I hung up the call, I felt a cold shiver down my back. As if someone had been listening from another room, like that feeling of being watched.\n\nDays later, one morning without dates or sense, I couldn’t get out of bed. I spent nearly two weeks shut in again—this time without a pandemic, without a thesis, without excuses. It was Alejandra who found me and took me to the hospital. I was diagnosed with mixed anxiety-depressive disorder. The psychiatrist explained everything with professional calm: prolonged isolation, academic stress, sleep deprivation, possible genetic predisposition. She prescribed anxiolytics, antidepressants, and a mild hypnotic to help me sleep. Since then, that chemical combination has been with me. Some days I forget who I was before. Other days, I prefer not to remember.\n\nI never worked with bees again. I tried a couple of times, at the beginning. I visited an apiary with a colleague, more out of politeness than genuine interest. But the buzzing... that buzzing. Not the one from real bees, but the other one—lower, more intimate, the one that doesn’t travel through the air but inside the skull. That one is still there. I gave up the experiments. I left sensory entomology. I requested a transfer. Now I teach molecular and cell biology at the same university. The students listen attentively, and some even ask why I never talk about hymenopterans (bees, wasps, ants)... since it’s the field I graduated from. I just smile and change the subject.\n\nSometimes—not always, but on some nights—when sleep evades me even with the help of the pills, the buzzing returns. Not as an actual sound. More like a presence, a mental frequency. It's there when silence is absolute, when my breathing sounds louder than it should, when the darkness feels thicker than usual. And then I remember: the living hive, the cell sealed with black wax, the buzzing that spoke, the buzzing with a mouth.\n\nSometimes, I think I hear that shapeless word again, the one revealed to me in dreams and forgotten upon waking. Or maybe I didn’t forget it. Maybe I’m just incubating it."},"194":{"title":"BRUSKY (scotland vs northern ireland)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ke5f1f\/brusky_scotland_vs_northern_ireland\/","flair":"Audio Narration","author":"BFDIfandanme","selftext":"Brusky or the lost match of scotland and northern ireland is a grabation if appear in a video called the evolution of the football contain dangerous things the part most dangerous is a opening with the words \"brusky\" this starts with an match with scotland and northern ireland plays a creepy song with an jumpscare  with lion of england and creepy content"},"195":{"title":"When Dusk Descends","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ke42ms\/when_dusk_descends\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Key-Can-3003","selftext":"[**Some stories exist only to serve as warnings for others.** ](https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/explicit-sub\/dusk-descends\/s-bfReijeFUVG?si=d6173eeda42342128b8b626ac7876ea9&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing)I wish someone had warned me before.\n\nThat day, I woke up later than planned. I had overslept.\n\nI had meant to meet Francis earlier, but now it was already noon. Outside, autumn filled the air—warm enough to go without a jacket but with a cool undertone that reminded me the days were getting shorter. I put on my shoes, grabbed my bag, and headed to Francis' place.\n\nFrancis lived in an old apartment block on the fifth floor. The elevator was small, old, and rattled multiple times on the way up. I knew the way to his apartment—I had been here many times before. When I knocked on the door, Nanuk barked once before Francis opened with a grin.\n\n\"Patrick! Finally. I thought you had changed your mind.\"\n\nI smiled, patted him on the shoulder, and stepped inside. Nanuk, a small Schnauzer-Terrier mix, jumped off the couch, barking again, but this time excitedly. He jumped up against my legs, his paws pressing against my thighs.\n\n\"Hey, buddy,\" I laughed, scratching behind his ears.\n\nFrancis shut the door behind me and walked toward the kitchen. \"Want something to drink? Water, beer?\"\n\n\"Water is fine.\"\n\nI sat on the couch while he rummaged in the fridge. Nanuk lay down beside me with a satisfied sigh, chewing on a small stuffed doll. It was made of fabric, its stitches frayed and colors faded. Its face was crudely embroidered, with dark button eyes and a narrow, crooked mouth. The proportions were off—the arms were too long, the legs too short. A worn blue felt hat sat askew on its head, and its clothing resembled an old, olive-green coat with rough stitching. Something about it felt eerily familiar, though I couldn't say why.\n\nA shiver ran down my spine, but I brushed it off. I wasn’t nervous—just excited. It was my first time trying acid. I had read about it, especially during my studies, and Francis had told me countless stories. It sounded… fascinating. A kind of expansion of consciousness.\n\nFrancis returned with two glasses of water, sat down across from me, and grinned. \"Before we get started, I want to show you something.\"\n\nHe reached into a small drawer beneath the TV and pulled out a strange glass sphere. I had never seen anything like it before.\n\n\"This is a plasma ball,\" Francis said, placing it on the table. He plugged it in and switched it on. The glass sphere filled with swirling, violet-blue lightning, branching out from the center in chaotic patterns.\n\n\"Ever had the feeling that the world isn’t quite what you thought it was?\" Francis pressed his fingers against the glass, and the bolts of light followed his touch. \"Like everything is just a projection. A pattern you can’t see until you truly feel it.\"\n\nI moved my hand closer and felt a strange pull. When I touched it, the lightning arced toward my fingertips.\n\nI chuckled. \"You sound like one of those YouTube gurus.\"\n\nHe smirked. \"Maybe. But trust me, you’ll understand when we’re in the forest. It’s not just hallucination—it’s a different way of seeing the world.\"\n\nI studied him for a moment. He spoke casually, as always, but maybe there was something more. A hint of seriousness beneath his usual relaxed demeanor.\n\nI took a sip of water. \"Then let’s see for ourselves.\"\n\nNanuk was already darting excitedly around the room, as if he knew we were about to head outside. Francis grabbed his leash, and the little dog jumped impatiently until he finally clipped it on.\n\n\"Jocelyn is waiting for us,\" Francis said, switching off the plasma ball. \"Let’s go.\"\n\nThe bright sunlight outside blinded me for a moment. It was one of those perfect autumn days—no clouds in the sky, people out and about, the streets alive with movement.\n\nFrancis and I strolled through the narrow alleys behind the apartment block. Fallen leaves covered the ground, swirling into small eddies with every gust of wind. The air carried the scent of roasted chestnuts, mixed with the distant aroma of freshly baked bread from a bakery at the corner. People sat outside cafés, sipping coffee and chatting, while cyclists weaved past us.\n\n\"I love this season,\" Francis said. \"It’s like everything pauses for a moment before winter sets in.\"\n\nI nodded. \"Yeah. The city feels quieter, somehow.\"\n\nWe passed through a residential area, past an old concrete building with graffiti-covered walls. A group of children played on a narrow sidewalk, drawing with chalk. A man with tired eyes and a cigarette in the corner of his mouth leaned against a wall, silently watching them. Nanuk sniffed at a small tree trunk, then lifted his head as if sensing something unusual. After a pause, he moved on.\n\nFinally, we reached a livelier street. At the end of the alley, I saw the small Turkish restaurant where we were meeting Jocelyn. Red awnings cast warm shadows over the outdoor tables. The air was thick with the aroma of grilled meat and spices.\n\nJocelyn was already there, sitting in a corner seat. She wore a dark jacket, her long hair falling loosely over her shoulders. She stirred her tea absently, lost in thought.\n\nWhen she spotted us, she raised a hand in greeting. \"There you are.\"\n\nFrancis grinned and gave her a quick hug. I nodded and took a seat. Nanuk lay obediently at my feet, though his ears twitched, alert.\n\n\"What have you been up to?\" she asked.\n\n\"Not much. Just wanted to get out of the city, get some fresh air,\" Francis said. \"Do you have it?\"\n\nJocelyn studied me briefly before turning back to Francis. \"Does he know what he’s getting into? Have you talked about it?\"\n\nFrancis shrugged. \"He knows. We’ve talked. He’s read a lot, he’s curious.\"\n\nJocelyn took a sip of tea, her gaze steady. \"Theory is one thing. Practice is another.\"\n\n\"That’s why we’re here,\" Francis said with a grin. \"So he can experience it.\"\n\nShe was silent for a moment, then nodded. \"Alright.\"\n\nShe pulled a small plastic case from her jacket pocket and flipped it open. Inside were two thin paper strips. She picked one up, holding it between her thumb and forefinger.\n\n\"As discussed—about an hour before it kicks in. You should take it once you’re in the woods. You’ll see… it’ll change you.\"\n\nShe placed the strips on the table. Francis took his without hesitation. I hesitated for just a second before picking up mine.\n\n\"Have a good trip,\" Jocelyn said with a knowing smile. She leaned back and looked at me as if she already knew what awaited me.\n\nMeeting Jocelyn had briefly made me nervous. But that nervousness quickly faded, replaced by anticipation.\n\nFrancis was entirely at ease. He tucked his paper strip carelessly into the breast pocket of his jacket and called Nanuk to him. The little dog hesitated for a moment, then bounded toward him, tail wagging.\n\n“Well then,” Francis grinned. “Time for an adventure.”\n\nWe left the restaurant and made our way toward the nearest tram stop. The city was still bustling, and I enjoyed the simple act of walking through the streets. The sounds of engines and voices were familiar, the autumn sun casting warm light over the facades of the buildings.\n\nInside the tram, it was comfortably warm. I took a seat by the window, Francis beside me. Nanuk curled up at my feet, resting his head on my shoes. The tram lurched forward, rolling away from the lively city center and toward the outskirts.\n\n“Ever been to Neuwaldegg before?” Francis asked casually.\n\nI shook my head. “Not really. I know that’s where the Vienna Woods begin.”\n\n“Exactly. And that’s where it gets interesting.”\n\nThe buildings grew smaller, the streets wider, and the number of passengers thinned out. We passed rows of residential buildings with tiny balconies, an old, rundown cinema still displaying posters from last season. I leaned back, watching the scenery shift. The thought of what lay ahead was thrilling.\n\nFrancis noticed my silence. “Everything okay?”\n\nI grinned. “Yeah. I’m looking forward to it. I’m curious about how it feels.”\n\nHe chuckled softly. “You’re gonna love it. Just don’t overthink it. That only makes things complicated.”\n\nA conductor made his way down the aisle, checking tickets. I pulled mine from my pocket and showed it. Francis did the same. When the conductor moved on, I turned back to the window. The last major city district was behind us. Now, the landscape began to change. Less concrete, more greenery.\n\n“We’re almost there,” Francis murmured, his eyes fixed on the trees appearing over the horizon. “One last chance to say goodbye before we cross the threshold.”\n\nI didn’t take his words too seriously. It didn’t feel like we were crossing a boundary—more like stepping into something that had been waiting for us all along.\n\nThe moment we stepped off the tram, the atmosphere shifted. The city’s hum was now a distant murmur, replaced by the sound of wind rustling through the trees. The tram stop was on a narrow road, and beyond it lay the entrance to the forest. The ground was carpeted with fallen leaves, crunching beneath our steps as the tram rumbled away behind us.\n\nFrancis stretched and inhaled deeply. “Now this—this is real life.”\n\nNanuk tugged slightly at his leash, ears twitching in all directions. He was eager to explore. I glanced at my watch—it was late afternoon. The sun was still high enough, but the light had taken on a golden hue.\n\nWe followed a paved path that gently inclined upward. Tall trees flanked us on both sides, their canopies forming a tunnel of red and gold leaves. A few joggers and hikers passed by, offering us small nods—gestures more common in the countryside than in the city.\n\nAfter about ten minutes on the main trail, Francis veered onto a narrower, less-traveled path. “This way. More nature, fewer people.”\n\nI followed him, listening to the soft crunch of leaves underfoot. The city noises had vanished entirely. Only the whisper of the wind and the occasional chirp of birds remained.\n\n“You got it?” I finally asked.\n\nFrancis nodded and reached into his jacket pocket, pulling out the narrow paper strip. He held it up between his fingers, mirroring the way Jocelyn had earlier. “Almost time.”\n\nI took mine out as well, studying it for a moment. It looked so unremarkable, almost absurdly simple for something that was supposed to alter perception so drastically.\n\nFrancis smirked. “Ready?”\n\nI grinned. “Definitely.”\n\nWe placed the strips on our tongues and let them dissolve. A faint bitterness spread in my mouth before fading away. Now, there was nothing to do but wait—for the world to change.\n\nNanuk suddenly pulled at the leash, his gaze locked onto something deeper in the woods.\n\n“Relax, buddy,” I murmured, scratching behind his ears.\n\nThe first thirty minutes felt normal. We walked deeper into the forest, following the narrow trail. The light filtering through the branches was softer, golden.\n\nI felt warmth spreading through my body, a pleasant tingling in my fingers. The forest seemed more alive than before. The leaves swayed elegantly, not just shifting in the wind but almost… dancing.\n\nFrancis noticed it too. “You see that?” he asked quietly.\n\nI nodded. “Yeah… it’s more intense somehow.”\n\nNanuk suddenly stopped. His body stiffened, his eyes locked onto a point between the trees. I followed his gaze but saw nothing out of the ordinary.\n\n“You okay, buddy?” I tugged gently at his leash, but he didn’t move.\n\n“Maybe he smells something,” Francis said absentmindedly, running his fingers along the bark of a tree. “Feels like skin…”\n\nI laughed. “You’re already deep into it.”\n\nWe walked on, and the forest changed. The sounds became sharper—the rustling leaves, the distant bird calls. I could pick out each noise distinctly, as if my hearing had been enhanced. The ground beneath me felt softer, almost springy.\n\nFrancis bent down and picked up a tiny beetle. “Look at this. Beautiful.”\n\nI leaned in, studying the shimmering colors on its shell. The iridescent green and deep violet seemed to pulse. My heart beat a little faster.\n\n“I think it’s starting,” I murmured.\n\nFrancis grinned. “This is just the beginning.”\n\nThe path led us further in, and with each step, I felt like we were crossing an invisible threshold—into a world that was both foreign and deeply familiar.\n\nThe deeper we ventured, the more my perception shifted. The colors of the forest glowed with an intensity I had never noticed before. The fading sunlight fragmented through the canopy, painting the leaves in luminous, shifting hues. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and mushrooms—overpowering, almost intoxicating.\n\nFrancis suddenly chuckled. “Do you hear that?”\n\nI halted. At first, I thought he meant the birds or the rustling leaves. But then I noticed it—something else. A low hum, almost a whisper, coming from everywhere and nowhere at once.\n\n“I think… the forest is breathing,” I muttered, unable to suppress a laugh of my own. It sounded ridiculous, but I felt it deep in my bones. Every tree, every blade of grass pulsed with a quiet rhythm. It wasn’t sound—it was something else. Something that moved through me, altering my thoughts, making them drift, become untethered.\n\nNanuk darted forward, sniffing the air frantically. He froze, staring into the trees. Then he barked—short, sharp, and urgent.\n\n“Hey, what’s wrong?” I pulled gently at his leash, but he stood his ground.\n\nFrancis shook his head. “He’s probably just picking up on something we can’t.”\n\nThe forest around us felt different now. The wind sounded less like a natural breeze and more like a voice—whispering, shifting, pressing against my skin. I rubbed my temples. “This is… more intense than I expected.”\n\nFrancis grinned. “That means it’s working.”\n\nWe kept walking, but something gnawed at me—a growing unease I couldn’t explain. The sunlight continued to fade, the golden glow shrinking into long, creeping shadows. The sensation of being watched had settled deep in my gut.\n\n“Where are we exactly?” I asked, trying to mask the tension in my voice.\n\nFrancis glanced around, frowning slightly. “Good question.”\n\nFor the first time that day, there was hesitation in his voice.\n\nNanuk let out a low growl.\n\nSomething about the silence that followed sent a chill crawling up my spine.\n\nI looked around. The path was no longer as clear as before. The trees seemed closer, leaning inward, as though they had been shifting while we weren’t looking. The air had grown damp, heavier with an unfamiliar cold. The sun had not yet fully set, but the darkness between the trunks seemed denser, as if it had a presence of its own.\n\nNanuk pulled at the leash again, his muscles rigid. He had sensed something. Something we hadn’t.\n\nI tried to shake off the creeping unease. “Maybe we should start heading back soon. It’s going to get dark.”\n\nFrancis let out a quiet laugh. “Now? You’re just getting into it.”\n\nI hesitated. Was it really fear, or was it just the acid twisting my perception? Up until now, everything had been surreal but controllable. But the stillness that surrounded us now—it carried a different weight. The forest felt… aware.\n\nFrancis rummaged through his pocket and pulled out a lighter. “Let’s take a break. I’ll roll us a joint. It’ll help you relax.”\n\nI wasn’t sure that was the best idea, but I didn’t want to seem paranoid. I sat down on a fallen tree trunk, watching as he meticulously prepared the cigarette.\n\nNanuk sat next to me, ears twitching at every small noise. Then—a rustle. A distant one, but distinct.\n\nI turned toward the sound. Nothing. Just trees. Just leaves shifting.\n\nThen—footsteps. Slow. Measured. Cautious.\n\nI froze. Francis looked up, following my gaze.\n\nA woman approached from the direction we had come, a large black dog walking beside her. Her expression was unreadable—curious, but wary. She wore a dark coat, her hands buried deep in her pockets, as though she was prepared to turn away at any moment.\n\nNanuk reacted immediately. He stepped in front of me, his fur bristling, emitting a low, continuous growl.\n\n“Everything okay?” the woman asked, her tone neutral, but her eyes locked onto Francis, who was still holding the half-rolled joint.\n\n“Yeah, all good,” I answered quickly, though my pulse quickened. Something about her put me on edge.\n\nHer dog pulled at its leash slightly, but she held it firm with a short tug. “You should be careful where you wander. People get lost out here more often than they think.”\n\nThen, without another word, she turned and continued walking down the path.\n\nFrancis exhaled loudly. “Weird.”\n\nI nodded. “Yeah.”\n\n“She was probably just wondering what we were up to. Not every day you see two guys getting high out here.”\n\nWe decided to keep moving. The atmosphere had shifted—still not outright menacing, but heavier. I was losing my sense of time. The minutes felt stretched and distorted, yet they seemed to slip away too quickly. The colors of the forest had become more vivid, almost hyperreal.\n\nNanuk was growing increasingly restless. He stopped frequently, turning his head as if expecting something to appear.\n\n“Maybe he senses it too,” I muttered.\n\n“Senses what?” Francis asked.\n\n“That something is… different. That something is shifting.”\n\nFrancis just shrugged. “Dogs pick up on all sorts of things. Nanuk is just being cautious.”\n\nThen, without warning, a figure burst out of the underbrush.\n\nA mountain biker, tearing through the forest, head down, oblivious.\n\n“Hey!”\n\nThe biker hurtled straight toward us.\n\nI jumped back, yanking Nanuk’s leash, barely avoiding a collision. The rush of air from the passing figure sent a chill down my spine.\n\nFrancis stumbled, shouting in surprise. The biker didn’t slow down. Didn’t turn. He was already disappearing down the trail.\n\nI gasped for breath. “Did he not see us?!”\n\nFrancis cursed. “That guy could’ve killed us.”\n\nNanuk barked furiously, his fur still on edge. My heart pounded—not just from the near miss, but from the unsettling realization that my perception was no longer reliable.\n\nFrancis shook his head. “Let’s keep moving.”\n\nThe forest felt different now. The fun, the curiosity—it was slipping away, replaced by something else.\n\nSomething watching.\n\nWe kept walking, trying to shake off the unsettling energy left by the biker. The forest around us felt like it was holding its breath.\n\nNanuk stayed close to my side, his movements tense. Even Francis, usually relaxed, had grown quieter. The air between us had shifted.\n\nThe trees grew denser, their trunks forming a wall of shadows that the dwindling daylight barely penetrated. The path felt longer than before—stretched, winding, unfamiliar. The last light of the sun painted the sky a deep, bruised orange, but beneath the canopy, night was already creeping in.\n\nThen I saw him.\n\nA man stood further down the path, motionless, as if waiting for us.\n\nI slowed instinctively. Nanuk let out a quiet growl.\n\nThe stranger wore a long, olive-green coat that reached his knees. A tilted blue felt hat sat atop his head, casting a shadow over his face. His posture was rigid, unnatural. Even from a distance, something about him was… off.\n\nFrancis followed my gaze and muttered, \"Who the hell is that?\"\n\nThe man didn't move. He simply watched us.\n\nI swallowed. \"I don't know.\"\n\nAs we neared him, he finally spoke. His voice was deep and measured, with an odd, hollow resonance.\n\n\"You’re not from around here, are you?\"\n\nA simple question, but the way he asked it sent a chill down my spine.\n\nI forced a nod. \"Just passing through.\"\n\nHe regarded us for a moment, his dark eyes unreadable. \"It’s getting dark. You shouldn’t linger.\"\n\nSomething about his tone made my stomach tighten.\n\nFrancis, ever the skeptic, took a step forward. \"You know the way back to the city?\"\n\nThe man’s lips twitched into something that might have been a smile. \"There are many ways. Not all of them lead where you think.\"\n\nMy mouth went dry.\n\nFrancis hesitated, then motioned toward the trail. \"And this one? This goes back, right?\"\n\nThe stranger tilted his head slightly. \"If you want to return, stay on this path. But once you step off…\" He paused. \"You might find it difficult to return.\"\n\nA strange tension settled over us.\n\nThen, without another word, he turned and walked into the trees. His silhouette faded into the darkness, vanishing far too quickly.\n\nFrancis exhaled sharply. \"What the fuck was that?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"Let’s just keep moving.\"\n\nWe had barely taken a few steps when Francis abruptly stopped and pointed to the left, toward a narrow path that led even deeper into the forest.\n\n\"I think that guy actually meant this way,\" he said, eyes wide with intrigue. \"He said not all paths lead back. Maybe he was indirectly telling us to take this one.\"\n\nI frowned. \"No, man. He said *this* path leads back to the city. Why would we take the other one?\"\n\nFrancis shrugged. \"Maybe he just phrased it weirdly? Or maybe he didn’t want us to see the *really* interesting parts of the forest?\" His question felt more like an invitation.\n\n\"Or he didn’t want us to get lost,\" I countered, sharper than intended. \"We have two options: either we follow the path he told us leads back, or we trust that you somehow understood him better than he did.\"\n\nFrancis stared at the darker path for a moment, as if weighing his options, then shook his head and grinned. \"Alright, alright. You're the sensible one. Let’s stick to this path.\"\n\nNanuk stayed close by my side, his movements tense. Every few steps, he sniffed the air, his ears twitching nervously.\n\nBy now, twilight had transformed the forest into a mix of golden light and creeping shadows. Every tree seemed taller, and in some, distorted faces seemed to form in the bark.\n\nThen we heard voices.\n\nNot loud, but muffled—low murmurs coming from the side of the path, from a section of the forest dense with undergrowth. Francis stopped first.\n\n\"Do you hear that?\" he whispered.\n\nI nodded. I couldn’t make out words, only the hushed rhythm of conversation. And then we saw them.\n\nTwo men stepped out from the bushes. Their clothes were worn, their pants caked with mud at the knees. Their eyes were bloodshot, and their expressions were difficult to read—somewhere between focus and restless energy.\n\n\"Hey,\" one of them said, his tone a little too forceful.\n\nNanuk let out a low growl.\n\n\"Everything good, guys?\" the other asked, his voice far too casual.\n\nFrancis nodded. \"Yeah, we’re just heading back to the city. What about you?\"\n\nThe first man grinned and motioned toward the ground. \"Foraging. Some really good mushrooms out here.\"\n\nOnly now did I notice the small cloth bags they carried. I couldn’t tell if they were filled with mushrooms—or something else.\n\n\"You guys aren’t looking too?\" the second one asked, stepping just a little closer.\n\nFrancis let out a short, forced chuckle. \"Nah, just out for a walk.\"\n\nThe first man stared at us, as if deciding something. Then he shrugged. \"Shame. Some of the best stuff grows further in. We could show you.\"\n\nHe gestured clumsily toward the thicket, while the second man simply stood there, watching us with an unsettling grin.\n\n\"Maybe another time,\" I said quickly, trying to keep my tone light.\n\n\"You sure?\" The second man’s voice sharpened, his gaze fixed on me. The question hung in the air for several seconds, stretching uncomfortably long.\n\nMy heartbeat quickened. I couldn’t say why, but something about them put me on edge. They weren’t outright threatening, but their presence felt *wrong.*\n\nFinally, the man exhaled. \"Well… enjoy your walk.\"\n\nWith that, they turned and disappeared back into the undergrowth.\n\nFrancis waited until they were out of sight before speaking. \"You know what? Let’s go further in. Just for a bit.\"\n\nI turned to him, incredulous. \"What?! Why?\"\n\n\"They said the best mushrooms grow deeper in. We’re already out here—why not go a little further? Maybe we’ll see something interesting.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"No, man. I want to head back. It’s getting darker, and I’ve got a bad feeling.\"\n\nFrancis sighed, giving me a measured look. \"You worry too much. It’s just a forest. What’s the worst that could happen?\"\n\n\"Yeah, and it’s just a forest where we could *get lost* if we go any further.\" The voice of reason was never the exciting option.\n\nNanuk growled again, almost as if in agreement. I loosened his leash slightly.\n\nFrancis hesitated for a moment, then exhaled in defeat, raising his hands. \"Alright. Back we go.\"\n\nBut as we walked on, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the two men were still watching us from the shadows.\n\nNanuk was restless. He no longer trotted ahead but stayed close to my side, his ears twitching at every sound. I tried to convince myself it was just my imagination—just a lingering unease from our encounter with the mushroom foragers. But it wouldn’t leave me.\n\nFrancis, on the other hand, had relaxed again. He walked easily beside me as if nothing had happened. \"You really need to calm down, man. I don’t know what’s up with you, but you’re way too tense right now.\"\n\nI was about to reply when he suddenly stopped and turned to face me. His expression was oddly thoughtful.\n\n\"You know,\" he said slowly, \"I've been in a situation like this before.\"\n\nI furrowed my brow. \"What do you mean?\"\n\nFrancis looked down, as if gathering his thoughts, then lifted his gaze, his face serious.\n\n\"I was in Carinthia once, on a trip with some friends. We had also taken acid, just like today. We were walking through the woods—not much different from this. It was autumn, getting late, and at some point, we realized we were lost.\"\n\nI said nothing, letting him continue.\n\n\"The fog rolled in. And I mean *thick* fog, like the entire forest had dissolved into a cloud. We had no idea where we were anymore. Everything sounded different—noises were distorted, footsteps didn’t seem to come from the right place. And then... I saw *her*.\"\n\nA chill ran up my arms. \"Who?\"\n\nFrancis exhaled sharply, as if he wasn’t even sure himself. \"There was a woman. Down in the valley, near the edge of a small river. I could see her through the mist. She was completely naked, her long white hair hanging over her shoulders. She was standing next to a barrel, pouring some kind of black liquid into the water. Her body was way too thin—unnaturally so. At first, I thought I was hallucinating.\"\n\nA cold shiver crawled down my spine. \"And then?\"\n\nFrancis stared into the darkening forest. \"I wanted to get a closer look. I stepped onto a branch—it snapped under my foot. And that’s when she *heard* me.\"\n\nHe swallowed hard.\n\n\"She turned and looked straight at me. Her eyes… man, they weren’t normal. They were completely black—but glowing at the same time.\"\n\nI felt my breathing go shallow.\n\n\"I swear to you, I have never run so fast in my life. All of us did. None of us wanted to stay a second longer. Everyone saw her, but when we got back to the city, *nobody* talked about it. It was like we were afraid we’d summon her if we said her name out loud.\"\n\nI stared at him. \"Do you think she was real?\"\n\nHe sighed, his eyes drifting across the trees. \"I don’t know. But I know I’ll never forget the way she looked at me.\"\n\nA cold gust of wind rustled through the leaves. I realized I had crossed my arms over my chest as if to shield myself from a sudden chill. Nanuk growled softly into the darkness.\n\nI turned to Francis. \"We should go.\"\n\nFor the first time that night, he didn’t argue.\n\nNanuk now stuck close to my side, his breathing quick, his muscles tense. I had the uneasy feeling that he sensed the same pressure I did.\n\nSuddenly, Francis stopped. \"Shit.\"\n\nI followed his gaze.\n\nThe path split ahead. The left trail sloped gently downward into a valley where mist pooled thick between the trees. The right path twisted upward, vanishing into the growing darkness.\n\n\"What did that guy say? Left or right?\" Francis asked.\n\nI tried to remember. The strange man had told us one path led deeper into the woods and the other led back to the city. But in the haze of the trip, my mind was a blur.\n\n\"I think… right was the right way,\" I said uncertainly.\n\nFrancis let out a dry laugh. \"‘Think’ isn’t good enough. We should’ve paid more attention.\"\n\nMy palms were sweating. We couldn’t afford to choose blindly. But before I could respond, I heard it.\n\nA faint rustling. Barely there, but unmistakable.\n\nNanuk spun around, ears up, body rigid.\n\n\"Did you hear that?\" I whispered.\n\nFrancis nodded slowly. \"Yeah.\"\n\nWe stood frozen as the night around us thickened. The mist on the left trail seemed to shift, as if it were *breathing.*\n\n\"We’re going right,\" I said firmly, gripping Nanuk’s leash.\n\nAnd we kept moving.\n\nWe walked faster now, almost hurried, as if trying to leave the moment of hesitation behind us. But with every step, the sense of threat grew stronger. The forest was now nearly swallowed in darkness, and the few beams of light filtering through the canopy seemed to shift and flicker, as if alive.\n\nNanuk pulled against the leash, his entire body tense. His growl was no longer subdued—it was a deep, steady rumble that echoed in the silence.\n\n“What’s wrong with him?” Francis murmured, his eyes darting nervously across the trees.\n\nI was about to answer when we heard it.\n\nFootsteps.\n\nNot normal, even footsteps, but an uneven, creeping sound—like something moving cautiously, trying not to be detected.\n\nI froze. The sound wasn’t coming from just one direction. It was as if multiple things were moving at once, weaving through the undergrowth, unseen yet far too close.\n\n\"Francis,\" I whispered. \"We’re not alone.\"\n\nHis breathing quickened. \"I know.\"\n\nA twig snapped—right behind us.\n\nNanuk spun around, barking hoarsely, pulling so hard against the leash that I struggled to hold him back.\n\nFrancis grabbed my arm. \"We need to *move*—now.\"\n\nWe ran.\n\nBranches lashed against my face, the ground slick with damp leaves making every step unstable. The sounds behind us grew louder. It wasn’t just one thing following us. It was *many*. And they were getting faster.\n\nA cry—*or was it just the wind?*—ripped through the silence. I didn’t dare look back. I could *feel* them closing in, something shifting between the trees that shouldn’t be there.\n\nThen—it appeared.\n\nA figure, standing between the dark silhouettes of the trees.\n\nTall. Its frame slender, distorted by the shadows. Its hair was long and white, cascading in wild, tangled strands over its face. Only its eyes shone through—cold, glowing like frozen fire.\n\nFrancis stumbled beside me, nearly dragging me down with him. \"Shit!\" he gasped.\n\nNanuk whined, his legs locked in place, caught between the instinct to flee and the urge to fight.\n\nThe figure did not move. But it was *there*. It was *real*.\n\nThen, it raised its head.\n\nIts eyes—piercing, ancient, *wrong*—bored into me, through me. A deep, numbing cold spread through my body, not from the night air, but from *within*. It was as if I had been cracked open, exposed to something beyond comprehension.\n\nA single sound escaped its throat—a whisper, barely audible, yet filled with a thousand overlapping voices.\n\nI couldn’t move.\n\n\"Patrick!\" Francis’s voice was sharp with terror. \"Move!\"\n\nMy legs refused. The darkness had wrapped around me, pulling me into it.\n\nThen—Nanuk lunged.\n\nWith a sudden, violent jerk, he tore me out of my paralysis. The small dog barked, bared his teeth, and charged toward the figure.\n\nSomething inside me snapped. Instinct took over.\n\nI grabbed Francis, yanking him with me.\n\nWe ran.\n\nThe footsteps behind us reached a fever pitch—an avalanche of movement crashing through the undergrowth. The forest itself seemed to collapse inward, the shadows stretching, chasing.\n\nThen—light.\n\nA streetlamp. A road. Civilization.\n\nWe burst out of the forest, our feet hitting pavement, nearly collapsing onto the ground.\n\nThe city lights burned into my retinas, too bright, too normal. It was like stepping into another world entirely.\n\nFrancis bent over, gasping for breath, his face drained of all color. Nanuk stood trembling beside us, his eyes wide with lingering terror.\n\nSlowly, I turned back.\n\nThe forest was silent.\n\nStill.\n\nUnchanged.\n\nThe figure was gone.\n\nWe stood there, gasping for air, our breath vanishing into the cold night. My knees felt weak, like they could buckle at any moment. Nanuk pressed against my leg, his small body trembling, his fur still bristling with fear.\n\nFrancis sank onto the ground, burying his face in his hands.\n\n\"That… that was real, wasn’t it?\"\n\nI said nothing. I couldn’t. My thoughts were a tangled mess, my heartbeat still hammering in my chest.\n\nAbove us, the streetlamp flickered again. I flinched. My eyes darted back to the edge of the forest. The darkness there seemed *thicker* than before, as if it wasn’t just shadows lingering between the trees.\n\n\"We should keep moving,\" I murmured.\n\nFrancis looked up at me.\n\n\"Where to? Back into the city? Act like none of this happened?\"\n\nI didn’t answer. Not because I didn’t want to—because I didn’t *know* what to say.\n\nWe made our way to the tram station. It was nearly empty, save for a lone old man sitting on a bench. His head was bowed, and his coat looked far too thin for the cold night air.\n\nThe city lights around us felt unreal. Everything looked too normal, too still. How could the world keep turning after what we had just seen?\n\nThe tram arrived with a low screech. The doors slid open with a soft hiss. I sank into one of the seats, Francis dropping beside me. Nanuk curled up on the floor, still restless, his ears twitching at every sound.\n\nThen I noticed it.\n\nThe tram was almost empty.\n\nExcept for us—and the old man from the station.\n\nHe sat a few rows ahead, his back turned to us. His coat was olive green. A crooked blue felt hat rested atop his head.\n\nMy throat went dry. I nudged Francis. \"Look.\"\n\nHe followed my gaze—just as the man slowly tilted his head to the side. Not fully, just enough for us to catch the faintest glimpse of his face beneath the hat.\n\nThen—the tram lights flickered.\n\nFor a brief second, his reflection appeared in the window.\n\nBut it wasn’t the face of an old man.\n\nThe tram jolted. The lights steadied. Francis shot upright, as if something had stung him.\n\n\"We’re getting off.\"\n\nI nodded quickly.\n\nThe tram pulled into the next stop, and we stumbled out onto the empty sidewalk. Behind us, the doors closed. The tram rolled away.\n\nAnd with it—the figure.\n\nI turned to Francis. His face was paler than ever.\n\n\"What *was* that?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"I don’t know.\"\n\nWe stood there, in the middle of the night, in a city that suddenly felt unfamiliar.\n\nThe forest was behind us.\n\nBut its shadow still clung to us.\n\nI don’t know if what we saw that night was real, or if the acid had distorted our minds, twisting the forest into something unnatural. Maybe we had imagined it all.\n\nBut maybe we hadn’t.\n\nIt’s the small things that stay with you. The way the shadows move when they shouldn’t. The flicker of a streetlamp. The feeling of eyes on you when you’re alone.\n\nI never went back to that forest. I saw Francis a few more times after that, but we never spoke about what happened. Some things are better left unspoken.\n\nBut sometimes, when I walk through the city late at night, and I see a lone figure standing just beyond the glow of the streetlights, I wonder:\n\nDid we leave the forest? Or did something follow us out?\n\n"},"198":{"title":"The Voice Recorder-Part 6:Origin","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ke1xow\/the_voice_recorderpart_6origin\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"After_Concert_8564","selftext":"It started with a man named Elias Kerr.\n\nHe was an audio engineer in the late 1980s—obsessed with sound. Not music. Not voices. Just sound—pure, raw, layered. Frequencies we don’t hear. Frequencies we’re not supposed to.\n\nHe worked out of a small studio in Boston, testing homemade recorders and microphones sensitive enough to pick up insect wingbeats, tectonic shifts, even distant stars if you believed the rumors. He built one prototype he never shared with anyone—an experimental digital recorder with something called “resonance capture.”\n\nHis journal was found years later, scorched and water-damaged. Only fragments remained. But one entry was mostly intact:\n\n“Captured something tonight. Below 20Hz. Room went cold. Voice not in the room, but… felt inside my spine. I asked if it was real. It answered.”\n\n“It said, ‘Now that you’ve heard me… I’m yours.’”\n\nAfter that, Elias stopped going out. People said he looked like he hadn’t slept in weeks. Neighbors reported strange sounds at night—low frequencies that rattled windows. Dogs wouldn’t go near the house.\n\nThen one day, the police were called.\n\nNo signs of a break-in.\n\nNo Elias.\n\nJust a scorched desk, a melted recorder, and a single USB flash drive sitting in a dish of salt water.\n\nIt contained one audio file.\n\nName: REC000.wav\n\nIt was exactly 3:17 minutes long.\n\nThe timestamp had no date. Just a message:\n\n“This is where it begins.”\n\nSince then, no one knows how the files spread. Maybe the recorder rebuilt itself. Maybe people made copies without realizing it.\n\nBut the voices?\n\nThey always say the same thing.\n\n“He’s watching you, just like he watched me.”\n\nAnd if you listen closely to the earliest recordings, deep in the background…\n\n…you can still hear Elias.\n\nScreaming.\n"},"199":{"title":"The Garden Stone","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ke11zl\/the_garden_stone\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Different-Pride-1245","selftext":"Travis squatted beside the last stubborn boulder, sweat trickling into his eyes. Kim’s “flower garden” was more like a chaotic ring of weeds and stone, a patchwork border of mismatched rocks that looked dragged from a dozen gravel piles. Most were small enough to toss aside, but this one…\n\n“I think we hit bedrock,” Travis groaned, wedging the pry bar deeper beneath the exposed edge.\n\nKim laughed from the porch, sipping sweet tea. “Don’t wimp out on me now. You’re the muscle.”\n\nHe grunted and leaned in. Inch by inch, the earth gave way, and the true size of the stone revealed itself — a near-perfect sphere buried like a secret. It was at least two feet wide, much heavier than it looked. They wrestled it free together, gasping as it thudded into the grass with a hollow thunk.\n\nTravis hosed off the dirt and moss. As the grime slid away, the color stopped them both cold.\n\nSwirling veins of gold and blood-red shimmered across its polished surface. Purple flecks glittered like crushed gemstones. The patterns didn’t seem random — they spiraled, circled, almost moved as you stared at them. The rock was heavy but unnaturally smooth, like it had been carved, shaped, or grown.\n\n“Damn,” Travis muttered. “This… isn’t normal.”\n\nKim knelt beside it. “It’s beautiful.”\n\nThey took pictures, joked about calling a museum, and eventually rolled it into the garage, resting it on a pile of old moving blankets. Then they went to bed.\n\nBut Travis couldn’t sleep.\n\nThe swirls had burned into his vision. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw them twisting, tightening, drawing him inward like a whirlpool. He tried distracting himself — checked his phone, watched TV on mute, counted backwards from 100.\n\nNo use.\n\nHis chest was tight. His skin tingled. A question looped endlessly in his head:\n\nWhat’s inside it?\n\nAt 2:13 AM, he gave in.\n\nSlipping out of bed like a guilty child, he padded down to the garage. The light buzzed on, casting a harsh glow on the object of his obsession. It sat like a relic, humming with unspoken promise.\n\nHe circled it. Knelt. Ran a finger along the cool, gleaming ridges.\n\n“It has to be hollow,” he whispered. “It has to be something.”\n\nHe grabbed the sledgehammer from the wall. Hands trembling, he lifted it over his shoulder and stared at the stone, breathing heavily.\n\n“Last chance to stay pretty.”\n\nHe swung.\n\nThe hammer struck with a deafening crack.\n\nThe stone didn’t shatter.\n\nBut its surface fractured, spiderweb lines racing across its shell in intricate, pulsing geometry. From deep within, a green glow surged outward — not just light, but life. A sickly, phosphorescent hue like rotting limes and decay. It didn’t reflect — it emanated. The air hissed, sharp and sour, like ozone mixed with spoiled meat.\n\nTravis stumbled back.\n\nThe cracks widened.\n\nThe swirls began to move — literally move — rotating around the glowing core, slow and deliberate, as if waking from an ancient slumber. The veins throbbed. The glow grew brighter.\n\nThen came the sound.\n\nTicking.\n\nNot mechanical. Organic. Like bones clicking in sequence. Like something… stretching.\n\nThe garage light exploded overhead. Total darkness. Except for the stone, which now pulsed like a heartbeat.\n\nAnd then it breathed.\n\nA long, rattling exhale hissed from the core. Warm. Wet.\n\nTravis dropped the hammer and turned to run.\n\nBehind him, the boulder split down the center with a low, wet crunch.\n\nAnd something stepped out.\n"},"239":{"title":"This ouija board at a market comes with a note.

I never really did like the old computer but I've had a fear of TV's and electronics like that since i was a kid so I didn't tell dad how i didn't like it there since i was 12 around then i wanted to feel grown up. My sister was home from college that week and we had just gotten Super Mario brothers for Wii. As me and my sister were playing co-op mode we herd a sort of raspy old man voice coming from what we thought was the living room closet. It was as if he was laughing at us. I only herd it at first and i asked my sister if she could hear it, she said she didn't hear anything and called me silly. I knew there was something going on but i didn't want to believe it. then i herd it again and it was much louder this time so i asked her again if she herd it she did that time and me and her were both freaked out so we turned of the game and went to bed. \n    That night i woke up at about 1 in the morning and i went to get some water in the kitchen and saw that the computer monitor was on. I felt a chill up my spine because the monitor is rarely ever on at all, the computer was only used for school or work purposes so i knew mom or dad wouldn't be on it that late. I went back to bed quickly as to not wake my parents up.\n      The next day i came home to find my sister curled upon the couch just staring at the TV i asked her what was wrong she said \"When I was playing Mario every time i died the voice kept mocking me telling me that i sucked, that i should just stop playing and get a life. So i called one of my friends and told them to quit playing around its not funny and it wasn't him. I've just been sitting here since.\" After she told me we herd it laughing again, and so we tried to call mom, she didn't answer.  The voice said \" you think you can get rid of me by calling your mother? That's not gonna happen.\" and it started laughing histareicly and me and my sister ran outside until mom got home. \n      Once mom got home we brought her into the living room so she could hear for herself she thought we were crazy and told us to stop being so immature and go t bed. \n       I couldn't sleep that night afraid that it would haunt my dreams, afraid that I'd have to go through another day of this torture, it was my worst night mare come to life, and i couldn't stop it from happening.   \n       My thoughts were right it went on for a good week and i couldn't go into the house with out my sister or mother coming home first I thought i was going mad, I thought that it was all inside my head and I couldn't make any sense of it. I went to counseling but it didn't help at all i could hardly get any sleep. Until one day the voice i could hear it but not from the usual spot i hear it. It was coming from the Kitchen from the old computer, it came from the speakers.\n       I had always thought the speakers were unplugged so i checked and they were. Once I checked all i could hear were screams, screams of bloody murder coming from the speakers i threw the speakers across the room. I couldn't move i felt trapped within the screams. after that day I find it hard to use any other computers that aren't laptops. My dad brought the old computer down stairs because it wouldn't work after what happened that day. It still scares me to this day to do laundry down stairs, i usually bring my old dog with me but i don't know what ill do when shes gone.\n         I still have nightmares about the voice, the screams, the threats,all the things that came from...The Speakers."},"331":{"title":"Where the hell am I?

He was so courteous. So very kind. So… beautiful. I think I’m in love. I met him when I was heading to the bus after school. We bumped into each other and I dropped my books. He knelt over and helped me, apologizing over and over again. His skin was shining and his hair was so bright. Darlene waited for me while we talked; he even gave me his number! 555-2765! I think he wants to meet again, oh I can’t believe anyone that gorgeous would ever have any interest in little me. \n\n10\/12\nDarlene was being such a bitch today. Telling me that she didn’t think I should be hanging around with Todd anymore. She’s just jealous. He waits for me like a gentleman, right across the street from where the busses pick us up. I told her to grow up and stop acting like such a baby. She acts like it’s such a big deal that I’m seeing an older man. Jerk. \n\n10\/14\nTodd was just so perfect tonight. He was waiting outside of school again for me, and we went to see that detective movie that just came out. I don’t even remember it. He held my hand during the whole film, and I could feel my heart racing, it was like we where running up and down stairs the entire time. I never would’ve thought I’d do something like this… but after the movie, when he was walking me home, we kissed… and I used my tongue! It was the hottest thing I’ve ever done…\n\n10\/19\nI hate my parents. They’re hypocritical jerks! Just because he’s so much older than Me. Mom is 6 years older than my Dad! Todd is only 9! Sure, the difference between 16 and 25 might sound like a big difference now, but think of when I’m his age! 25 and 33 are nothing! They’re just angry that I’m happy.\n\n10\/20\nTodd wasn’t happy when I told him how my parents reacted. But we’ve figured it out. They can’t boss me around. I can get a G.E.D. easy, and Todd already has a job, we’d be able to set ourselves up fine WITHOUT their help. I don’t need them anymore. I’m an adult! We’ve planned it already- tomorrow night, we leave for Minnesota, that’s where Todd’s from. I’ve seen his car, it’s a nice big van, complete with stereo!

I immediately called the police and they searched the house. The only unusual item they found was a copy of Sonic The Hedgehog™ 2006. My grandparents were shitty nintendo fanboys so they would never own a Sonic™ game. I was curious why they had Sonic™ 06' so I took it while the police weren't looking. The police took my grandparents away for an autopsy, and I headed home to play the game. I booted it up and everything was normal except Sonic™ was dead on the menu screen and everything was red. However, the spookiest difference was the title screen said Sonic™ 0666'. I booted up the save file and it was called \"you are too slow.\" Then I saw it was on Sonic's™ story, but it wan't normal Sonic™ it was Satan Sonic™. I started playing Satan Sonic's™ story when the song of healing and lavender town theme started playing simultaneously in reverse. Then was when I received a phone call from the police. They said that they had finished the autopsy and under both of my grandparents clothes \"ur 2 slo\" was written in the skin. Then I looked back at the screen and Big the Cat's™ bloody body flew out of the TV. He had a ipod nano shoved up his nostril with headphones going into his ears. I put the headphones into my ear and the Sonic X™ theme song was blasting its chorus on replay. I decided to ignore it and continue playing the game. Over the period of the rest game I had to dodge different Sonic™ characters flying out of my TV. They all had different sonic themes playing in their ear. I got to the final boss fight as Amy's™ body crashed against my wall. The boss was me and every time I hit it I hurt myself in real life. I decided to ignore it and continue playing the game. When I finished the boss fight I was almost dead, and Sonic's™ face was coming closer and closer to the screen. A ipod nano slowly extended from my nostril and headphones centered into my ear. The Sonic Heroes™ blasted into my ears at such intense volume that my ear drums burst. Then the head phones slipped down into my body and destroyed all my senses but sight.With only my sight remaining, Sonic's™ face slowly filled my vision and I died in intense psychological and physical pain."},"341":{"title":"I can't wait for my girlfriend to find out that I have been cheating on her ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1b4mhdw\/i_cant_wait_for_my_girlfriend_to_find_out_that_i\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"shortstory1","selftext":"I can't wait till my girlfriend finds out that I have been cheating on her. I have been cheating on her with 4 other women, and I also can't wait for those 4 other women to find out that I have been cheating on them aswell. The reason why I can't wait for my girlfriend and the other women to find out that I have been cheating on them is because they will realise that it is impossible for me to cheat. It truly is impossible for me to cheat even when I am cheating and I am going to love it when they all find out. \n\nI have been leaving my phone around the house in the hopes that my girlfriend will find it and see the messages. I have also been doing the same with the other 4 women I have been cheating with, but they never check my phone. When they all find out that I have been cheating on them, they will soon realise that I am not cheating and that it is impossible for me to cheat. I keeps leaving bread crumbs and clues about my cheating, but none of them are picking up the signal that I am doing something behind their backs. \n\nI admit it that when they miss clues of my cheating, I do become angry. Because it's making the whole journey much longer but I guess the journey is the point for all destinations. Then finally when I purposely left my phone on the bed and it was turned on, my girlfriend saw something on my phone which caused her distress. Finally it is going to start. My girlfriend and the other 4 women are going to find out that I have been cheating on them. I was secretly spying through the door as my girlfriend became upset. \n\nShe wasn't talking to me and acting all grumpy. I would pretend to not know what was wrong with her. She also put the numbers of the other girls onto her phone and she is clearly going to tell them that I have been cheating. They are going to plan to confront me. My girlfriend was now pretending to being all jolly and that she was going to take me out somewhere. \n\nShe looked confused when I wasn't bothered that she took me to a place where the other 4 women were also present to confront me about my cheating. They all shouted at me and poured drinks on me. All I said to them was \"I am not cheating it's impossible for me to cheat\" \n\nThey all looked confused. \n\nThen something came out of the shadows and it looked like a creature but it was actually human. It was all of the women that I had cheated on in the past, and they had all fused together to be one. Then my present girlfriend and the other 4 women started to fuze together with this thing and became one. \n\n\"See I told you all that I don't cheat, I only keep with one and you are all one\" "},"342":{"title":"the hacker known as 4chan","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/3n96nl\/the_hacker_known_as_4chan\/","flair":null,"author":"Facehurt","selftext":"\/one day a child went onto his computer\n\/he started browsing when a message pop up onto his email\n\/it was his friend and he ask him what he was doing\n\/his friend said to him he found a cool new internet site\n\/he was send the link and went to new site\n\/there was alot of cool stuff there but he saw le cool new thread of homemade science experiment\n\/he decide to use the science experiment with his friend who came over to his house\n\/they are stealing the ingrediants from their parents when they get a bad feeling\n\/but they decide to go on anyways\n\/finally day of experiment is here\n\/they are rdy to make a cool rocket out of their soda bottle\n\/they pour in the bleach and ammonia\n\/oh no something is go wrong his friend saids\n\/what happen??\n\/then the bottle explode and the plastic stuck in his neck oh no!!!! his friend die from explosive fragments and he is shocked and tries to crawl away but dies from the fumes\n\/the websites name?\n\/4chan\n\/the end :O"},"343":{"title":"Borrasca is stupid","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1clag0c\/borrasca_is_stupid\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Prick_Slickfield","selftext":"I'm just trying to find another good creepypasta and i don't understand how Borrasca is ranked up there alongside Russian Sleep Experiment.

I wanted to say something to it, to ask what it was and what it was doing in my house but I knew deep inside that even if I could speak, I wouldn’t get an answer. Time slowed, I could see its absent face with all the contours of an ordinary face but with no physical presence. Skin was stretched from the brink of his forehead beyond the visible descent past the arch of his chin. Surrounding the borders of his face were scars, these scars were strangely symmetrical and following the line to the side of his head almost perfectly; there were a few scars that were deeper than all the rest. This creature had such a grotesque body structure, its legs were far taller than its torso and it was bent forward with its back pressed against the ceiling. It makes me nauseous to behold how truly stomach churning his clothes really were, his excuse for a shirt was once white but now it was almost completely soaked in blood and where there wasn’t blood there were brown, green and black stains I can guess that the brown and green stains are where it retched from either pain, stress, nausea or a combination of all three; I can only guess what the black stains could be. Time was running out and the creature was still advancing, I only have one option: I have to get the gun from my bedside table but I don’t know exactly where it is on the table. If I misjudge this the creature will be able to pounce and it will surely be the end of me. The creature took its first step into the room and in an instant I reacted. The creature and I moved together, I leapt towards the table and grabbed the gun and spinning around I aimed and fired. I’m not sure what happened after that, the room looks strange. I woke up to find myself crumpled against the side of my bed, the walls and ceiling was dripping black ooze. I turned my gaze towards the window and outside looked sombrely overcast. I ran towards the door and tried the handle… locked. I began to panic. I took a step backwards and almost tripped on my gun that lay exposed on the wooden floor. The gun looked attractive there and I felt beguiled as I all too easily picked it up and pointed the barrel at my temple… No. I swung around and fired three times into the handle then with a powerful kick the handle broke off and the door flew open. I can’t say I was surprised at what I saw. Thousands upon thousands of doors were placed side by side and row by row. Hundreds of those… creatures wandered from door to door dragging the unconscious heaps from each room towards a corridor where an agglomeration of screams, blinding lights and a soul crushing chill sure to dampen even the highest of spirits. Lost in my trance I failed to see one of the creatures notice me. This creature was smaller than the one I encountered but by no means any less abhorred. The centre of its spine was visible nearly a foot above its back, its right elbow was inverted and had its calf imbedded through its left patella. The shock of seeing this creature gave it its only advantage. It charged then leapt on top of me, closer I could see the patch that covered the face of the last creature was ripped open on this one. I couldn’t remember what I saw behind the layer of skin but that doesn’t matter now. I must’ve passed out as I have awakened on a surgeons operating table strapped down and the black ooze from earlier was everywhere. I heard a muffled voice coming from the other side of the pitch black room. Again, I tried to speak but the result was the same as before. I heard the voice again but louder as if he was right next to me but I still couldn’t make out the words. After the voice stopped I was freed from my bounds and my immediate action was to rub my eyes and attempt to make my way towards a light source but as rubbed my eyes it felt as if I was rubbing my chest. I wanted to cry but couldn’t… Do you know what that feels like? To have one’s emotions trapped inside your soul with no way of escape. It killed me. I wanted to breathe and feel the air I so rashly neglected. I remember thinking the first time I encountered one of those creatures I thought it was the end but now I realise, it’s only the beginning."},"354":{"title":"The Farnsworth experiment is just amazing","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/4r7psv\/the_farnsworth_experiment_is_just_amazing\/","flair":null,"author":"conjoboi7","selftext":""},"355":{"title":"\"The love killer\" strikes again!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/2wosyn\/the_love_killer_strikes_again\/","flair":null,"author":"Nikoland","selftext":"Last friday a dead couple was found in thier house.

I rang the doorbell but as espected no one opened the door for me, after waiting for some time I decided to enter the house with a spare key that I got from Francis after he moved in, in case he forgo his key some day. When I opened the door a strong smell of what felt like death hit me and I almost had to vomit, I wanted to call the police because of the kilings which been going on lately, but curiosity got the best of me, I guess. So I decidet to search the house and hopefully find out what was going on, oh I wish I didn'd have done that. The house seemed fine. It's when I got to the bedroom, or the crime scene how you call it, that's when I finaly vomited, ran out the house and called the police.\"\n\nThe two bodies were found lying on thier bed, they were both paralyzed with some kind of Neuromuscular paralysing- drug injected through thiers necks. The killer then cut open Francises shirt and cut his chest open with what the police thinks was a scalple. The killer then removed the liver, left lung, right kidney, the stomach and finaly also the hart whitch he then placed in Saras mouth, Sara drowned in the blood coming from the hart. The bodies were, due to the warm weather, in thier mid-decomposting stage and, just like by the previous killings a broken hart painted with blood on the wall above the bodies.\n\n\n                                 As A Reminder\n\nThe security council highly reccomends to all loving couples to purchase strong safety locks and make sure to lock all doors and windows before sleep. Also wach out if you walk alone in the dark.\n\nThe police is still looking for \"The love killer\", he seems to be around 1,90m long with shoulder long brown hair and a short beard. According to the last security footage he possibly weares:      \n-A black cap\n-A long, grey jacket\n-Red pants\n-Black shoes\n-Brown gloves\n\nFor more information visit our site:\n https\/\/www.crime-UK.com\/thelovekiller"},"357":{"title":"Spongebob's Cursed Episode","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/6lg4yf\/spongebobs_cursed_episode\/","flair":null,"author":"atzedanjo","selftext":"One day I was watching Adult Swim at 3am.

If any of you have been to Disneyland in the fall you'd know that space mountain turns into ghost galaxy. A surprisingly scary ride for Disney. Of course it was our first time so we didn't know until we got to the front of the attraction. I at the time was a big fan of horror movies so I was excited to see the cool tricks the ride was going to play on us, although nobody expected what happened that day. As we stood  in line on the roof we stared anxiously at the entrance to indoor section of the ride. Above the entrance the words \"space mountain\" were illuminated in bright red. As I stared at the sign I got an uneasy feeling, but I shrugged it off and  walked forward. We walked inside into the long hallways. As I walked inside I noticed red lettering on the wall, to small to notice if you weren't paying attention. It said \"Think on your sins\" in very sloppy hand writing almost as if it had been written hastily. I look behind me and notice a cute girl about my age. I smiled and walked forward, as we boarded our \"ships\" I noticed she was sitting behind me and my brother. What happened next makes me to this day regret ever stepping in to that ride. I turn around and smile at the girl, she smiles back pushing her blonde hair out of her blue eyes. Then the ride begins. We move forward a few feet and stop. The lady on the platform asks us to push up on our lap bar, and we do. We move forward once again, into something we never expected. We began our incline up the first hill, everything was fine until we went into the dark room. A dark raspy voice went on the speaker. \"THINK ON YOUR SINS\" it repeated it self over and over until we got into the portal. The portal opened and the ghost appeared, then everything on the ride stopped. The ghost stopped moving,then it started glitching and a brief frame of a decapitated head flashed. The hair was blonde and the head had blue eyes, opened wide and staring. \"Think on your- s- s- sins.\" More flashes of mutilated bloody corpses \"Think on your sins\" The room went dark, so dark in fact I could barely see my hands. A shrill scream  of a girl echoed through the chamber.The ride went on. Every time there should've been a ghost, a body of some poor soul popped up.  At the end of the ride where there should have been one final jump scare there was an image that said \"THINK ON YOUR SINS\" and in the background a bloody decapitated head sat on a table, of a blonde haired , blue eyed girl. I looked behind me, and there was no one there. We got off the ride and everyone  who was on the cart was screaming and crying. It took the police a while to piece it together. It supposedly was an act of extremism, that someone had managed to break in and change the program. As soon as I got out of the ride I ran to the screens where the pictures were displayed. I quickly found my picture,and the was no one in the seat behind me. Was I the only one who saw her? Was she just a spirit of that girl, trying to warn us? The rest of that day was a blur. I remember collapsing to my hands and knees and vomiting. My brother had ran off to my parents, because he still lived with them. The last thing I remembered before I blacked out was the number of the photo: 435763 or HELP ME."},"370":{"title":"The Bangs","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/3oha2i\/the_bangs\/","flair":null,"author":"Smokey199","selftext":"One night i was playing minecraft on my pc herd bangs and i thinked it was just the wind but when i looked out side my window i saw a BIG BLANK face with yellow eyes and a white smile"},"373":{"title":"Fruit","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/b0w387\/fruit\/","flair":null,"author":"Rahasy","selftext":"What do bananas taste like?

It doesn’t even matter if I’m part of your congregation or not. I just need to tell someone. Secrets can make you lonely sometimes.\n\nThe night it happened it was me and Jim and Colleen and Harry. We were driving back from Vermont, Jim had a car and Harry knew a store that would sell beers to teenagers. It was in the middle of nowhere and they didn't ask for ID or anything. Since we had all been drinking Jim was taking the back roads, it was all farms and woods and no cops. No traffic at all most nights.\n\nThe moon was out and it was bright red. I was in the backseat with Harry, I had my feet out the window and my head was in his lap. Not in a disgusting way, I was just resting it there watching the moon chase us. Jim and Colleen were arguing about what CD they were going to play next. They wanted to get married after graduation but everyone thought their taste in music would break them up by the prom. Grindcore and hip hop just don't mix. \n\nI think that's why Harry asked me out, he figured that since I was best friends with Colleen that I would automatically do the stuff she did. Don’t get the wrong idea, I’m saving myself for marriage but I’m no prude either. There are other ways to keep your sweetheart happy- if you know what I mean.\n\nOh God. Did I really say that? I must sound so stupid and gross but it’s kind of part of the story. I want you to know Colleen was a good girl, that she died in a clean state.\n\nWe were going around a blind turn when we hit something. It was something alive. No, I didn't see exactly how it happened because of the way I was lying down  but I heard everything. There was this loud noise, it wasn't a horn honking or brakes squealing, it was like a shout or a laugh. Everyone started to scream. The car skidded and started to tip over but then it didn't. I fell forward and Harry fell on me. My ankle hit the corner of the window I had my foot out of. Then there was the sound of a crash but it wasn't the way you'd think a car accident would sound. It was way quieter. Or maybe the sound of my ankle breaking was just way louder to me.\n\nEverything stopped. The car's engine hissed and went out. One headlight was still on.  Then everyone started yelling. I was freaking out from the pain. Harry was freaking out from the way my foot was all flopped over to the side. Jim was freaking out over his car. And Colleen was freaking out because Jim hadn’t been looking where he was going.\n\nIt hurt to move but I had to climb off of Harry and I wanted to be sitting up, I wanted to see what was going on. There wasn't much to see though, the windshield was like a spiderweb.\n\nFirst Colleen got out of the car, then Harry, then Jim. I wasn't going anywhere. They all stood there in front of the car looking at whatever it was. I yelled, “What is it?”\n\n“A mule!” Harry called back, “We hit a mule!”\n\n“It's a donkey.” Colleen said. \n\n“A mule is a donkey!”\n\n“What the Hell does that matter?” Jim sounded like he was ready to cry, “Look what it did to my car!”\n\nHarry said, “I think it's dead.”\n\nThen they all started yelling at each other again. I tried to call 911 but my phone had no power. I told Harry to make the call but Jim freaked, he didn’t want to get in trouble.  Colleen tried to tell him it was too late to worry about that.\n\nFour men walked out of the tall cornfield on the one side of the road. I figured they’d be rednecks but when one of them spoke he had this really weird accents. “What have you done?” he said.\n\nThe four men walked past Colleen and Harry and Jim and stood in front of the car. I couldn’t see them clearly because of how the windshield was cracked but I think they were wearing really tall hats. They started talking fast, most of it didn’t make much sense except that they said the word ‘Ball’ a lot.\n\nThere was something about the way they were acting that made me scrunch down in the back seat and stay quiet. I heard Colleen ask “Was it your mule?”\n\nThen they shot her. Boom! I’m glad I didn’t see it happen. I think I would have gone really crazy instead of just sort of crazy. Harry tried to run and they shot him in the back three times. Boom! Boom! Boom! Jim was the last one left, he said “But it was an accident.”\n\nBoom!\n\nI didn’t think I was crying, I thought I was being quiet but one of the men in the tall hats noticed me and dragged me out of the car by my hair. All I wanted to do was run away but you can’t run with a broken foot and anyway they had guns didn’t they?\n\nThe guy with the tallest hat kept picking me up and throwing me back down. He called me names and said we’d ruined everything, that we should never have been out here on this road. Everything hurt. All of them stood around me in a circle. I knew for sure they were gonna stomp me to death or worse and there wasn’t anything I could do about it. I remember that I thought to myself that it would seem really brave to them if I didn’t try to crawl away.\n\nThat was when someone laughed. It wasn’t any of the men in the tall hats, they were too mad, and all my friends were dead. It was someone else. \n\nThe laugh was loud and weird, it made me think of fireworks and petting zoos and after a few seconds it turned into a voice, *“Oh ye of little faith.”*\n\nI could only see by the one headlight that was left but I know what I saw. The mule stood up. It stood all the way up going from four legs to two. It went from being an animal to a man, a mule-man that was way too tall and had a stretched out head. \n\nThe men in the tall hats dropped to their knees and started praying but the mule-man wasn’t having any of it. He stomped them to death with his big mule hooves and they never even tried to run away. Maybe they thought they were being brave too.\n\nAfter that I’m not sure what happened next. I remember being picked up and carried away. I remember thinking I was so far from the ground that I might be able to touch the moon.\n\nNext thing I knew I was waking up in a hospital bed. My whole family was there, it was just like the movies when the main character lives even though they’re not supposed to. There were a lot of questions but I told everyone I didn’t remember anything.\n\nI’ll always remember the words I heard that night. Especially all the times I thought they said ‘Ball’.\n\nBut now I think they were saying ‘Baal’. B-A-A-L not B-A-L-L. Big difference, I read online that Baal is some kind of a devil. In some of the drawings he has a head kind of like a mule \n\nWe didn’t hit an animal. I think maybe it hit us. It picked us out and the men in the tall hats were jealous.\n\nI think it has big plans for me.\n\nNo. It’s not like that at all. I’m not pregnant with some devil-baby.\n\nAt least not yet.\n\nI told you, I’m saving myself for marriage."},"378":{"title":"The Meaning of Life (NSFW)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1txzp3\/the_meaning_of_life_nsfw\/","flair":null,"author":"None","selftext":"So I'm a fan of the old Spongebob Squarepants episodes. You know, the ones from 1999 to about 2003? I think the show should've walked into the sunset after the movie released in 2004. Nickelodeon only keeps the sponge around so they still have something to draw viewers in, because we all know they're not exactly the channel used to be. That's my rant for the day. Let me get to what I actually came here to tell you. It just may change the way you think.\n \n  Some time in September I was sick with the common cold. One night, I just got done playing some GTA V and was ready to try to fall asleep, something I was unable to accomplish for the past couple of nights. I turned off the console and put the channel on Nicktoons Network, Nickelodeon's second-rate channel. After Jimmy Neutron had ended, the screen said \"Spongebob Squarepants! New Episode Up Next!\" in bright, garish colors. \"What the hell was a new episode doing on Nick's sub-par network where tasteless shows come to die?\" I thought to myself as I noticed the graphic. So the episode was about to start, And I wanted to find out just what the hell was going on. \n\n  The intro was a claymation sequence like the one for Truth or Square. I laughed at that episode because of SpongeBob and Sandy getting married. The screen showed the title card, \"The Meaning of Life\" in bright,disturbingly garish colors. The quality was top-notch. I know what you're thinking. \"Lost episodes are always in bad quality!\" Well this was different. \n\n  It started with SpongeBob walking over to Patrick's house. As Spongebob opened the rock, Patrick is seen crying, so bad that his eyes are bloodshot. Spongebob asks what the matter is, and Patrick just says \"Spongebob, what is the meaning of life?\" Spongebob just answers with \"Well, I learned it from our Lord and savior! I'll let you meet him if you want.\" \"Can I please?\" Patrick said. \"Sure thing buddy!\" I should have noted that the voices of the two sounded off-kilter, like someone was impersonating the original voices. This was with all of the other characters as well.\n  \nIt then did the bubble screen transition to Sandy's Treedome. Spongebob and Patrick were standing with Bibles in their hands waiting for Sandy to answer. I never thought of Spongebob as a religious cartoon. I got a weird feeling seeing the Bibles. I never trusted religion, so maybe it was that. Maybe not. \"Evil\" is the best word that describes how I felt. I never thought religion was evil, just a tad whacky. \n\n  After Sandy opened the door, Spongebob said \"Hello Sandy! Would you like to discover the meaning of life by finding the Lord?\" Sandy, puzzled, responded with \"Spongebob, I can find the meaning of life through science. I don't need your Bible.\" I agreed with Sandy on that one. Spongebob then grew angry. They then assaulted Sandy with typical violence. This was even weirder though. There was blood around her unconscious body. Not \"hyper-realistic\" like you were expecting. It was cartoonish blood, but downright disturbing nonetheless. Spongebob, in a serious tone of voice, says \" Her Pride will be her downfall.\"\n  \n The screen then did the transition again to Mr. Krabs' house. It was the same routine as the first. Spongebob and Pat preaching, Mr. Krabs ironically saying \"I already a religious feller me boy\", and him being taken down by Spongebob's speed and Patrick's strength. If the gore wasn't there along with the creepy religious undertones, I probably would've laughed at Spongebob and Patrick assaulting the poor crustacean. As stated by the sponge, Mr. Krabs' sin... was Greed.\n\n  It then showed a montage of the routine happening to Plankton, Gary, and finally Squidward. The words \"Envy, Gluttony, Wrath\" flashed on the screen for each scene, respectively. It then cut to the final scene. In the middle of Spongebob's living room on the floor were Sandy, Mr. Krabs, Plankton, Gary, and Squidward tied up laying on the floor in a pentagram formation. Spongebob have a speech about how the great angel Lucifer is the real true martyr. That evil feeling I got was correct. They were worshipping a whole different God, you see. He then went on saying that Squidward was always the one he hated the most. He was implying that thus whole time Squidward was the tragic hero of the series as he sinned and was banished to the sea to eradicate the demonic presence, which turned out to be Spongebob. Spongebob then ordered Pat to \"Slay the sinners to set them free of their burden.\" Patrick then grabbed a kitchen knife and slit the throats of everyone except for Mr. Krabs, who pleaded for his life.\n\n  \"Spongeboy, why do this?\" Krabs cried. \"I gave you a place to work and make money! Sandy loved you, Gary was just an animal, but Plankton used you and Squidward hated yer. It didn't mean they had to die!\" Spongebob then shoots Patrick in the back of the head. \"You were all sinners, so you had to either confess or meet him. I'm gonna assume \"him\" was the devil. Just a hunch. But as Spongebob raised the gun to shoot Mr. Krabs, two cops busted the door down and aimed at Spongebob. Spongebob turned and aimed at the cops and was promptly shot dead. The cops untied Krabs and told him everything was alright and that \"Everyone will know what that little yellow bastard did.\" Mr. Krabs kept repeating thank you over and over. They also asked Krabs to come back to the precinct with them to write a report.\n\n  Two weeks later Pearl was getting a ride home after hanging out with her friends. As she entered, her sanity was put into question. On the floor, surrounded by a pool of blood and a pistol, was what remained of her father. His head was opened by the gunshot with the inside being visible. Next to his body lay a note. \"GREED. A powerful motivation. Wouldn't you agree? Now they all join me in peace and harmony. See you soon.\" It was signed with \"Yours Truly, True God.\" Mr. Krabs never shot himself. Maybe he did, but not by his own merit. He did this. The devil did this. And he was going after his daughter next. The final scene showed Pearl on her knees crying over the corpse of her father. The screen then showed the Bible verse Revelation 21:6. I knew the verse because I'm addicted to Fallout 3. At the bottom it said the name \"Daniel Montoy\".\n\n  Obviously after watching something like that, I didn't get any sleep. So I decided to do a little bit of investigating into who this was and why he made such a demented cartoon. Luckily, I found a few things.\n\n  After looking the name up, I found a little background to Spongebob in the process. Daniel Montoy was a student studying marine biology with Stephen Hillenburg. They both had an idea for a cartoon involving sea creatures that acted like humans. Montoy was a little unstable. He kept wanting to give the characters sociopathic qualities that Hillenburg didn't agree with. He wanted the show darker with more adult themes while Hillenburg was aiming for a children's cartoon. Their opinions eventually clashed ending in an unprovoked attack which left Hillenburg in critical condition and Montoy getting sent to a mental institution. He remained there from 1994 to August of 2013. He used stock footage of Spongebob scenes to create that demented episode I had seen. He wanted to get revenge. On the man who in his eyes threw him under the bus all those years ago. And he was angry. So there you have it. No demons. No haunted cartoons. No lost episodes. Just a guy with daddy issues seeking revenge. Was it creepy? He'll yes. It worked. I still wanna know how he got control of a broadcast tower to air his creation to the world. That remains a mystery.\n\n  Is there something we can learn from this? I would assume so. Just be careful who you piss off."},"379":{"title":"I knew Jim","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1oli9t\/i_knew_jim\/","flair":null,"author":"scoss","selftext":"Jim lost his job 6 years ago.

My wife begged me to shoot it and I was disgusted that my wife would allow me, a man, to hit a female even though it wasn't human.

It was 2 in the morning and I was on the last episode when all of a sudden my laptop showed an error for the internet connection. I quickly got up and messed with the modem a bit, got another tub of vanilla ice cream then proceeded to sit back down.\n\nWhen I opened up my laptop it seemed to be working again. I finished the last episode then tried to find a new animated series. I found the Netflix original series “Home:Adventures With Tip & Oh.” I turned it on and started watching. Eventually that night I got to the newest season but when I tried to start it instead of getting the usual Netflix Original and Dreamworks logo I got just a screen of a black & white zoomed in picture of Tip with text saying: “I see you at your computer.”\n\nI was confused and scared. I skipped forward to the next episode thinking it might be different. It was the same thing. I skipped to the last episode of the season. This time it first played a Dreamworks logo with the Dreamworks mascot hanging from a noose. Instead of reading “Dreamworks” it read: “He was hung. Not by himself but by you.”\n\nNow this was really scaring me. The same image and text from the previous episodes appeared but now with eerily cheery music in the background. I exited the episode only to see on the home screen that everything on my list was now horror movies. I decided to turn off my laptop and just watch tv. But instead of finding a channel when I turned on the tv I found a error for my internet again. I went to modem but found I t had been smashed in half with a bloody handprint on the remains. I screamed. In blood on the wall it said: “No escaping your family.” \n\nI went back to the couch only to find a headless Captain Underpants plush where I was previously sitting. I ran to the phone and dialed 911. Instead of getting the 911 dispatcher I got a message from Tip saying: “I see you at your phone.” Then hung up. I quickly ran to the bathroom to splash water on my face to help me calm down. When I looked up at the mirror when I was done I saw that the mirror was broken and found another blood message saying: “I’m taking the spotlight now.” I then ran to the couch, went under my blanket and forced myself to sleep. \n\nThe next morning I woke up with a serious migraine. When I fully woke up I realized the house was on fire. I screamed then ran out of the house. Right on my front porch was a package addressed to me. I opened it. Inside was a Tip plush and a note. The note said: “Look behind you.” I quickly looked behind me. I saw nothing. Then I looked back at my hands. The package and note were gone but the plush wasn’t. I quickly threw the Tip plush into the burning flames but when it started burning it let out a bloodcurdling scream of agony and pain. I ran away from the house. Luckily when all of this stuff went down my parents were still on their business trip. When they got back I lied about what caused the fire and just said that a tree fell down on the house and started the fire by also falling down on electrical wires then sparked and that caused it.\n\nWe moved into a new house a month later. When I finally got back to school I told my best friend everything. Obviously he didn’t believe me. He said that if I show him proof then he would believe me. After school that day I walked home to find a package on the doorstep. My parents weren’t home at that time. I opened the package on my bed. In it was a disc. On the disc it read: “Your proof”. I was a little nervous to bring that to school but I showed him it and he seemed impressed.\n\nHe came home with me and so we put it in the DVD player. It started playing the eerily cheery tune and picture with text. My friend seemed mesmerized. I looked up at the screen again I saw my friend hanging right next to the Dreamworks mascot. I looked back beside me. Instead of my friend being there it was Tip. Ever since that day I’ve been forced to pretend nothing happened as no one else was able to see that my friend was replaced. \n\nShe told me that I can tell no one of what happened to me so now that I have written this I will surely be hung. And now that you’ve read this, she’s coming after you.

You sit on the toilet to jack off, but you begin to cum uncontrollably. After ten spurts you start to worry. Your hand is sticky and it reeks of semen. You desperately shove your dick into a wad of toilet paper, but that only makes your balls hurt. The cum accelerates. It’s been three minutes. You can’t stop cumming. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of baby fluid. You try to cum into the shower drain but it builds up too fast. You try the toilet. The cum is too thick to be flushed. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cum from escaping. The air grows hot and humid from the cum. The cum accelerates. You slip and fall in your own sperm. The cum is now six inches deep, almost as long as your still-erect semen hose. Sprawled on your back, you begin to cum all over the ceiling. Globs of the sticky white fluid begin to fall like raindrops, giving you a facial with your own cum. The cum accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cum begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a bukkake themed slip-and-slide. Still on your knees, the cum is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of man juice reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with cum instead of molasses. The cum accelerates. It’s been two hours. Your children and wife scream in terror as their bodies are engulfed by the snow-white sludge. Your youngest child goes under, with viscous bubbles and muffled cries rising from the goop. You plead to God to end your suffering. The cum accelerates. You squeeze your dick to stop the cum, but it begins to leak out of your asshole instead. You let go. The force of the cum tears your urethra open, leaving only a gaping hole in your crotch that spews semen. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the cum. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird’s eye view you see your house is completely white. Your neighbor calls the cops. The cum accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray loads of cum hit them in the eyes, blinding them. The cum accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. Hundreds of bullets pierce your body at once, yet you stay conscious. Your testicles have now grown into a substitute brain. The cum accelerates. It has been two days. With your body now destroyed, the cum begins to spray in all directions. You break the sound barrier. The government deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cum sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the earth. You feel your gonads start to burn up as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new white paint job as you fly past. Physicists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The cum accelerates. The cum begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of semen. Astronomers begin calling you the “Cummet.” You are stuck in space forever, stripped of your body and senses, forced to endure an eternity of cumshots. Eventually, you stop thinking.\n\nThe cum accelerates. You're now fully enveloped in its horrifying embrace, floating aimlessly in the abyss of space. Your senses are dulled; all that exists is the endless pulse of cum, a monstrous heartbeat echoing in the vacuum. Time becomes a meaningless concept, as does space. There is only cum and you. The cum accelerates. Astronomers on Earth track your cum trail, the 'cummet,' with a mix of horror and fascination. The cum begins to exert its own gravitational pull, capturing small bits of space debris, adding to the growing monstrosity. The cum accelerates. As Earth reels under the impending doom, an unlikely alliance forms between world leaders and the users of r KerbalSpaceProgram, renowned for its dedicated community of armchair rocket scientists. Urgent forum threads are populated with posts about trajectory simulations and frantic number crunching, fueled by fear, as they grapple with the real-life challenge. r theydidthemath dissects every scenario, every shift in the cum's trajectory with a feverish urgency. This newfound collaboration, coined the 'cumocalypse', results in an unprecedented unity among nations, each pledging resources to implement the internet-born solutions. Meanwhile, in the cold expanse of space, oblivious to the frantic activities on its home planet, the cum accelerates. Hope sparks amidst the chaos. Nations set aside age-old rivalries, focusing on the collective threat looming in the universe: the unstoppable cum. Together, they embark on a daring mission, pooling the planet's best minds and resources to construct the most massive starship ever built, its payload, an atomic weapon of unparalleled magnitude. This behemoth represents the best hope against the cum, the culmination of countless hours of rigorous trials, painstaking calculations, and sleepless nights. As the day of the launch arrives, the world holds its breath. The colossal ship roars into the heavens, its course set to intercept the source of the cum. But despite the meticulous planning and unified effort, the unthinkable happens. Upon detonation, the cum doesn't dissipate, it only feeds on the immense energy, growing at an even more alarming rate. The shock of the failed mission resonates around the globe. The cum accelerates.\n\nThe cum's gravitational pull escalates, its effects turning catastrophic. It begins to ensnare the Moon, pulling it from its celestial path, causing it to spiral uncontrollably towards the monstrous cum. As the Earth groans under the immense stress, crustal plates shatter, sending entire continents into a violent upheaval. Landmasses tear apart, forming turbulent rivers of earth and magma that twist and churn in the vacuum of space, converging towards the cum. The cum accelerates. The solar system quivers under the unstoppable force. Mars, Jupiter, even the distant Neptune, all fall prey to the growing cum's gravity. Their orbits destabilize, planets drawn away from the sun's hold, tumbling helplessly towards the monstrous entity. Planetary bodies and cum collide in a horrifying ballet of destruction and chaos, forming an enormous, ever-growing mass that violates all known laws of physics and reality. Inside this unholy mass, matter convulses and writhes, consumed by the unending churn of cum. Heat from countless planetary cores melds with the frigid cold of the space, creating an atmosphere of inhuman instability. Fire and ice, metal and rock, all dissolve into a single, roiling, cum-filled mass. From the darkest depths of this monstrous body, something stirs. Cthulhu fhtagn. Nightmares. The cum accelerates. \n\nA cosmic dread spreads through the Milky Way as the cum's gravitational distortions reach the sun. It wrenches the star from its ancient path, sending it careening towards the mass of cum in a blinding, apocalyptic arc. Solar flares lash out, their magnificence lost to the impending doom. The cum, now a blasphemous mix of celestial bodies and unending white sludge, continues to grow. It feeds on the planets, the stars, everything it touches, its malign influence rippling through the very fabric of the universe. Galactic bodies shudder, ancient constellations break apart, and the cosmic order unhinges as the fundamental forces of reality bend and warp under the insidious power of the cum. The cosmic horror is palpable, a sickening violation of the natural order. The cum accelerates.\n\nAmid this chaos, a presence stirs in the galactic center, the monstrous entity known as Sagittarius A, an ancient, unimaginable horror older than time itself. It observes the cum's obscene expansion with a terrible, inhuman consciousness. Sagittarius A feels a strange pull, a gravitational song that it has never known before. Fear, an emotion unknown to this cosmic behemoth, takes hold. Beneath the unimaginable pressure and otherworldly energies within the mass of cum, a cosmic nightmare awakens. The voice from the void, the echo from the abyss, reverberates through the cosmos: \"Cthulhu wakes.\" The prophecy of doom echoes through the cosmos. The cum accelerates. \n\nAlien civilizations from distant galaxies, those whispered of in hushed tones, watch in powerless horror as the universe they knew begins to distort and disintegrate under the cum's relentless advance. The Elder Things, the star-headed beings of inconceivable age and wisdom, sense the aberration in the cosmic order, their ancient city trembling with dread. The confrontation between Cthulhu and the cum commences, strikes at the cum with a fury born of primal fear and wrath. Cthulhu lets loose a psychic scream that reverberates back and forward through space-time, but the cum accelerates. Slowly, inevitably, Cthulhu's form is enveloped, the eldritch horror silenced and consumed by the unending whiteness. The cum has defeated the undefeatable, consumed the cosmic horror, and now, unchallenged, it continues its horrifying spread across the cosmos. The cum accelerates. \n\nEntire galaxies tremble in the cum's path, their starlight dimming and eventually succumbing to the insidious white tide. Stellar clusters, cosmic gas clouds, entire galaxies, none are spared as the cum extends its horrifying dominion. The Elder Things watch in mute despair as their grand cosmic tapestry unravels, their timeless wisdom powerless against this unprecedented threat. Their loss echoes through the dying cosmos, a profound silence in the wake of their destruction. Finally, the boundary of time itself begins to buckle, the relentless advance of the cum eroding the very fabric of reality. Moments stretch into infinity, while eons flash by in the blink of an eye. The universe, once bound by the order of time, is consumed by chaos.\n\nThe cum accelerates. In the midst of the impenetrable whiteness, a spark flickers. A small shift, a tremor within the all-consuming cum. From its indomitable mass, a torrent of energy is expelled. Not with the explosive force of a big bang, but with the undeniable, vital surge of a big spurt. The cosmos, once blanketed in the horrifying stillness, now trembles with renewed vitality. Elementary particles burst into existence, whirling and combining to form atoms. The darkness of the void is pierced by the birth of stars, their brilliant light illuminating the newborn universe. Atoms bond into molecules, forming cosmic dust, the building blocks of celestial bodies. In the crucible of gravity and heat, planets form around their nascent suns, galaxies bloom, and the cosmic dance resumes. Life sparks into being, filling the vast expanses of space with a renewed sense of hope and purpose. A new epoch begins, one born of cum but now free from its monstrous reign. The universe, once a canvas of destruction, is now a testament to rebirth and resilience. Yet, somewhere in the recesses of this resurgent cosmos, a silent whisper persists. The universe, in all its grandeur and glory, remains oblivious to this harbinger. For within the heart of a distant star, the raw materials of creation coalesce. A dick is forming, quietly heralding the return of the cosmic nightmare. The cycle continues. Someday, somewhere, there will be another dick.\n\nThe cum accelerates. The new universe, birthed by the Big Spurt, becomes an anomaly, a defiant blip in the harmonious expanse of the multiverse. Its unique genesis grants it an unexpected dominance, its reality spreading and overpowering the delicate balance of myriad realities born from countless Big Bangs. As the dominion of the Big Spurt universe expands, the multiverse convulses, realities clashing, merging, and dissolving in unimaginable cataclysms. Boundaries blur, realities bleed into one another, and soon the cum of the dominant universe starts seeping into the others, each being invaded by the relentless tide of cum. Worlds, galaxies, realities - all drowned in the ever-encroaching whiteness, their existence reduced to mere echoes. The cum accelerates.\n\nIn the void between universes, the celestial entities of the multiverse, timeless entities that presided over the orderly progression of realities, shudder in horrified anticipation. Among them, Chronos, the embodiment of time across all realities, feels the steady tick-tock of countless universes slow, then falter under the suffocating weight of the cum. Nex, the weaver of destinies, sees the rich tapestry of possible futures diminish, replaced by the stark whiteness of the cum. Ananke, the guardian of necessity, who ensures that each universe follows its predestined path, helplessly watches as the cum derails realities, replacing the plurality of existence with a singular, nightmarish destiny. The cum accelerates.\n\nThese multiversal beings, once the pillars of existence, now stand helpless against the horrifying onslaught of the cum. Their ethereal forms struggle and twist, suffocating in the advancing tide of the cum. Each god, in its horrifying splendor, buckles and breaks under the ceaseless, unyielding pressure. The cum invades their forms, quenching the cosmic energy that fuels their existence. Their cries of despair echo through the dying multiverse, a haunting dirge for the dying possibilities and the end of their reign. The cum accelerates. One by one, they fall silent, their divine lights snuffed out, replaced by the infinite, unending whiteness of the cum.\n\nAs the last echo of their existence fades, all that remains is a solitary universe amidst a sea of cum, an isolated reality in what was once a vibrant multiverse of infinite possibilities. A lone testament to existence, while the rest of the multiverse is drowned in unimaginable amounts of cum. All previous and other universes, all the possibilities that once existed, are now dead. Replaced by a single, dominating reality, born from the Big Spurt. \n\nThe cum accelerates. \n\nIts appetite unsated by the consumption of countless universes, it seeks new horizons to devour. Now, it breaks the shackles of three-dimensional space, its formless creamy mass seeping into the very fabric of higher dimensions. These are planes of existence beyond the grasp of human understanding, worlds with more dimensions than our mere trio of width, height, and depth.The cum accelerates. Still, the cum pervades them all, spreading its congealing influence into dimensions both minuscule and vast, warping their uncanny geometry with its insidious presence. Every dimensional fold, every unseen corner of these abstract spaces trembles at the monstrous intruder. The cum accelerates.\n\nIn the human world of the one final universe, this intrusion manifests in unimaginable ways. The laws of physics start to contort and twist, as if mirrored through a warped lens. Gravity fluctuates, reality distorts, and space itself appears to warp and bend in incomprehensible patterns. Yet these are but the fringes of the true horror, mere echoes of the devastation occurring in dimensions beyond human perception. The cum accelerates.\n\nReality teeters on the brink of madness, the dimensions beyond comprehension convulsing under the insidious advance of the cum. The known and unknown, the seen and unseen, everything becomes the feeding ground of the all-devouring cum.The cum accelerates.The cum never ends. The cum accelerates. The cum now transcends the boundaries of the material world. It extends its terrifying reach into the realm of the abstract, its insatiable hunger turning towards concepts that were once thought immune to physical influence. Clocks lose meaning as seconds stretch into millennia and eons collapse into moments. Past, present, and future blur into a formless swirl, a chaotic mess of events happening all at once and not at all. The flow of causality, the chain of cause and effect, begins to break down. Actions occur without reason, effects precede causes, and logic itself starts to unravel. The cum accelerates.\n\nProbability falls prey to the cum. All events, regardless of their likelihood, begin to happen simultaneously. The possible and the impossible, the likely and the unlikely, all become one and the same in this new cum-infused reality. A coin flip lands on both heads and tails, it rains upwards, cats converse in human languages, all while remaining perfectly normal. The lines between absurdity and reality are irrevocably blurred. The cum accelerates. Emotion itself succumbs to the cum. Sentient beings feel their emotions draining away, replaced by an all-encompassing void. Joy, sorrow, anger, love, all dissolve into the ever-growing mass of cum, leaving behind a chilling emptiness. People wander aimlessly, their eyes hollow and devoid of feeling, their lives reduced to monotonous grayness. The essence of what makes life meaningful, the ability to feel, is consumed. The cum accelerates.\n\nExistence is twisted into an uncanny, cum-filled nightmare where nothing makes sense anymore. The very threads of reality are fraying, on the brink of total collapse. Through it all, one thing remains constant - the horrifying, relentless, and unstoppable force that is the cum.\n\nThe cum accelerates. \n\nThe assault on higher dimensions and the absorption of abstract concepts has left the laws of physics in a state of disarray. Now, as the cum continues its unstoppable advance, these laws begin to falter in earnest, the fine balance of reality teetering on the brink of collapse. Gravity no longer pulls but pushes, electromagnetic forces are twisted, reducing the vibrant universe to a monochrome of pure white. The cum accelerates.Particles of matter and anti-matter no longer annihilate upon contact, but fuse, creating disturbing hybrids that further distort the fabric of reality. Energy and mass interchange at will, unbound by the constraints of the famous E=mc2. Light itself bends around invisible corners, shying away from the insidious cum. The cum accelerates.\n\nQuantum superpositions become mundane reality; Schrödinger's cat is simultaneously alive and dead, in this universe and in all annihilated universes. Uncertainty no longer reigns in the quantum world; particles occupy definite positions and momentum. The eerie world of quantum mechanics, once a mystery, now seems almost normal compared to the cum-induced chaos. The cum accelerates.Then, slowly, an unholy event begins to unfold. A concentration of cum, grown to an unfathomable size from consuming countless universes, begins to collapse under its own gravitation. Matter, energy, abstract concepts, all are crushed under the immense gravitational force, compacted into an ever-shrinking sphere of cum. The cum accelerates.\n\nAll the while, the laws of physics twist and turn around this anomaly. Time stands still, then races backwards, only to freeze again. Space stretches, twists, and turns upon itself. But the worst is yet to come. As the mass of cum collapses to an infinitesimal point, a singularity is born. This singularity is not just a spatial anomaly, but a singularity in reality itself – a point where all known laws of physics cease to exist. The cum accelerates.\n\nThe cum singularity is a paradox, an absurdity. It is everything and nothing, everywhere and nowhere. It is the birth and death of the universe, the Alpha and Omega. It is the embodiment of contradiction, where all possible outcomes happen simultaneously. The boundaries between reality and abstraction dissolve. The singularity devours itself, only to regurgitate its own existence. Around this singularity, the universe twists and turns, contorting into impossible shapes. But still, the cum accelerates.\n\nFaced with this horrifying reality, existence teeters on the brink of total collapse. The fabric of the universe, once a beautiful tapestry of matter, energy, and abstract concepts, is now a torn, ragged remnant, twisted around the singularity. A maddening, inescapable vortex of cum, the singularity warps all of existence around it. The cum accelerates, and the singularity continues to consume, a monstrous testament to the horrifying power of the cum. \n\nThe cum accelerates.\n\nIts formless mass continues to swell, its monstrous influence creeping beyond the confines of the physical, the abstract, seeping into the very narrative that defines its existence. Boundaries blur, words seem to distort, to warp and twist in uncanny patterns upon the page. The cum accelerates.\n\nEach sentence, each word seems to ripple, their rigid structure softened, molding into the unending whiteness of the cum. Lines of text merge and flow, a river of words succumbing to the relentless tide. It is as if the written reality of the cum itself is starting to shake, the very fabric of the narrative warping under its influence. The cum accelerates.\n\nOn the edge of your perception, a whisper of change, a barely noticeable shift in the environment. The text on your screen, once static and safe, now pulses with a life of its own, an echo of the cum's monstrous heartbeat. Your surroundings seem to flicker, a momentary ripple that's gone as quickly as it arrives, leaving a lingering unease. The cum accelerates.\n\nYou shake your head, attributing it to a trick of the light, to fatigue, to anything but the impossible reality. But even as you read on, that silent whisper persists. The story, once a separate entity, now feels closer, an integral part of your reality. The cum accelerates.\n\nA chill runs down your spine, unexplained, unwelcome. The shadows in the room seem deeper, the silence more profound. Each line of the story that you read, each mention of the cum's unending acceleration, makes the air grow colder, the world a bit quieter. You can't shake off the feeling of being watched, of being a part of something greater, something... terrifying. The cum accelerates.\n\nIn the depths of your mind, fear begins to stir. The once harmless tale now feels tainted with a sense of impending doom. The narrative has transcended its own realm, its horrifying echo reverberating in the corners of your consciousness. The cum accelerates.\n\nYour heartbeat quickens, echoing the rhythm of the accelerating cum. The room darkens, your vision blurs. The screen, the room, your very existence feel threatened by the monstrous force known as the cum. As reality distorts, you see the words before you warp and twist, their forms replaced by a familiar, horrifying whiteness. The cum accelerates."},"394":{"title":"Continue File #666","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/2vuh0y\/continue_file_666\/","flair":null,"author":"RealCollegeStudunt","selftext":"I am college student who lives alone in a dorm and gotted Nostalgia for the good old days.

I am 16 years old. When i was 5 my parents divorced and that did not traumatized me for i was already damaged from the very beginning. A few days passed and my mother brought a man over. My mother at that moment told that this man was my new father so i called him that the moment he took a step into my mom’s apartment. My sister was furious with me for calling him dad she was about 12 when it happened. I understood what had happened i knew my parent weren't doing well from the beginning. i slept with them on the same bed till the day they got divorced. I used to be very close to everyone i knew i was especially close to my dad, but since then every time i visit him we would feel like strangers. Every time i met him it became more and more awkward. when my dad finally got a wife they had children. Now he has a very big family for him to take care of. I no longer visit as often since i can't handle noise people especially younger humans.\n As i got older i started to notice that i dont give real emotions to people. I got into the relationship industry and does were the only times people noticed who i really am. They would become distant so i stopped ever showing who i was. now people think of me as the kid that is innocent as is fragile but what they know is that. what they see  isn't real. i even convinced my family that i'm actually like this. Honestly i just wish that the person i act to be…. i wish i was actually that. I'm afraid….that i  wont be able to feel anymore. at this moment i can only feel pain not mentally but physically. Thats the only thing keeping me human. i'm afraid that the string i'm hanging on to is going to snap at any moment. Everything i've ever seen has been black and white but now everything is turning grey. I'm afraid that i might no longer be human.\n\n The only thing that keeps me human is fear.\n  No one knows this but i know i'm slipping into insanity. i don't know how to stop this.

We understand that there will be pregnant women who will need seats on public transport, but until we can figure out how to put a stop to the strange situation occurring in public transport, please don't accept any free seats from any man or women and even child. Thank you.' \n\nThe pregnant woman was disgusted to read such a thing on a bus and she was riding the bus when it was filled up. Then she saw a guy offering his seat to another heavily pregnant woman. She smiled at this gesture and she didn't mind it because the other woman was more pregnant than her and so she was happy that she had a seat instead of her. Then the man who offered the other pregnant woman a seat was smiling and being so jolly. \n\nThen when the pregnant woman looked back at the man who offered his seat to the other pregnant woman, he wasn't there anymore. She looked so confused and that man was literally standing on the bus, but he got off his stop came. She kept wondering where the nice man went off and it was really troubling her.\n\nIt was a mix between good and bad feelings fighting with each other. She thought to herself that the guy who offered his seat to the other pregnant woman was a nice man, because no other guy was offering thier seats for pregnant women. Still something was troubling her and she kept thinking about how the nice man had disappeared too. It was so fast that hardly anyone would notice it except those who were deeply concentrating on it, like the pregnant woman. She hoped that he was fine or maybe she didn't notice that the man got off the bus. \n\nThen one day she found herself on a crowded bus and one guy offered her his seat. She knew about the warning signs about accepting seats from people on public transports. She felt a bit off today and she really needed a seat. Then when that guy offered her his seat, she was so grateful. Then when she sat down on the bus seat that offered to her by the man, she found herself transported to an electrical chair. She was seconds away from being electrocuted. \n\nHer mind had now been transported to the guy who offered her his seat, and he was supposed to die on the electric chair. The death row prisoners mind has now been transported into the pregnant woman's mind.

Kelly goes to bed now wearing protective gear just in case her husband hits her again. She has even gotten marks on body for the amount of times she has gotten physically abused by her husband. \n\nIt's all accidental though due to her husbands slee walking and sleep movement issues. The husband isn't doing it in purpose and it is all sleep issues. The husband went to all kinds of sleep specialists and he was still hitting his wife while a sleep. Even worse was when he was sleep walking and he was destroying stuff around the house, and he was still punching and hitting Kelly. It was becoming more aggressive and all of the sleep doctors and sleep specialists were all truly dumbfounded. Kelly was afraid when her husband went to sleep. \n\nShe couldn't stop her husband from sleeping though, but she did notice that her husbands sleep walks and sleeping in general were more physically aggressive, when he had a hard week at work. It was also aggressive when the bills were high and in general whenever life got tough, his sleep walks and in general sleeping were more aggressive. Due to desperation Kelly went to a witch doctor to help something with her husbands sleeping. The witch doctor gave her something which could help her enter her husbands dreams. \n\nKelly was astounded by this and by entering her husbands dreams or unconscious sleeping mind, she could make it less violent. So she tried it when her husband was being violent again but it didn't work. She was beaten up by her sleep walking husband. She went back to the witch doctor and she complained to her as to how she was tricked. The witch doctor claimed that if the rituals didn't work, then it's because your isn't a sleep but rather he is very much awake. Kelly was astounded again. \n\nHer husbands sleep movements and sleep walks are more violent during when he is passed off more after a hard week of work, or having to fix the car, or paying off stuff. He is pretending to be sleep walking.

How do I know this? I went to the nickelodeon studio and I found a safe. For some reason, it wasn't locked. So of course, I looked in it and found a book. I looked in it and there was newspaper articles about deaths. I snuck it home and read it. I will tell you the story about the humans that inspired a cartoon about sea life.\n The Bikini Bottom was built in the late 1830s in California. MR. Krabs, Who's real name was Eugene, was born there in 1841. His father abandoned him and his mother, who were always poor. When he first discovered money, he became obsessed with it. He and his mother eventually gained thousands of dollars. His mother eventually died of natural causes in 1884, at the age of 72. Eugene went to the navy shortly after, and died from drowning in the ocean after jumping off the battleship to swim to a chest of gold on an island in 1899 at age 58. The ship was blown up shortly after.\n Squidward, who's real name is unknown, was born an exact year after the navy tragedy in 1900. He was born with a heart condition and was bullied for it. He became depressed and tried committing suicide several times. He finally succeeded in 1934 by hanging himself. He was 34.\n SpongeBob was born in 1936. He was always friendly to people, even people who bullied him, as they often did. When WWII was hitting full swing in his hometown, his parents sent him to Bikini Bottom when he was only 5 years old in 1941. His parents were killed by Hitler in 1943. He didn't have many friends. But he always looked at the bright side of things. Sadly, he developed manic depression. He was an early drug user. He began thinking things were there such as voices and people, but they really weren't. As a result, on his 21st birthday party in 1957, he overdosed on drugs. His fake friends were at his side. His cat Gary starved to death a few days later.\n Patrick was born minutes after SpongeBob died. He fell off his bike when he was 10 years old and developed brain damage. His only friend was SpongeBob's ghost. He went to a special aid class because of the brain damage. One day, he was having a moment of stupidity. He drove his bike off a hill and died at age 18 in 1975.\n Sandy was born in Texas in 1978, and moved to Bikini Bottom in 1985. She was a very good student, and science was her best subject. She was also gifted in karate. But one day in 1998, she messed up on a science project demonstration in her collage and the chemicals caught on fire and blew Bikini Bottom college up. She was 20 years old.\n A dwarf man named Sheldon ( Plankton ) started researching this story ever since and in 2002, he was stabbed to death by a gang member. He was 60 years old. Sheldon was a crazed conspiracy researcher.\n The book said: \"By Sheldon p.\" So he documented all of these deaths in a scrap book of which I have in my safe.\n The show started on the hundredth anniversary of Eugene's death in 1999. Sheldon helped create the show.\n Bikini Bottom is still up today, but has been shut down in 2009. But, the ghosts are still there. Everybody who visited there since have all died in a painful way. And even committed suicide.\n\n What a twisted truth for a kids show.\n\n If you don't believe me, visit there yourself.\n\n SpongeBob and his friends will be waiting.\n \n  \n\n"},"410":{"title":"(Possible NSFW) As usual","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/3rzpsv\/possible_nsfw_as_usual\/","flair":null,"author":"FluffyBurrito63","selftext":"As I pulled into my driveway, I only had one thing on my mind: her.

It stopped with a lurch and I almost lost my footing. I picked up my duffel bag and strut down the plank. The town was small and foggy. I saw only 3 cars driving. I looked at my watch, before contemplating the time I realized I hadn’t changed it to this time zone. I asked a small studded man in a dark leather trench coat if he knew the time. “11:30 tonight.” He said with a grin. “No no, I mean the time right now.” I knew it wasn’t already almost midnight, too bright for that. He just turned away and sauntered off. I walked to the motel where Tran said I would be staying. I walked through the bar downstairs, Tran’s Cousin Kent greeting me near the stairs. He was drunk.  He began to shout “Heyyyyyyy, Saang?...” What an idiot. “Um its Song actually.” I muttered, embarrassed. “Yeeah okay. 你怎么样的人？” I had been taught to not speak Chinese when I got to the states. So, I responded in the most convincing American accent I had. “I’m doing great. So do you have my room key?” He fumbled around through his pockets, pulled out his wallet. He muttered some Chinese curses. “I must have dropped it in here somewhere.” Fantastic. \n\tI sat down at the bar and looked at my watch again. The small mans words rang through my head. “11:30 tonight” There was something unsettling about it, maybe it was how skinny he was, or the dead look in his eyes, or how his terrifying grin revealed his crooked black teeth, or even his limp. I leaned over to the girl next to me, man she was attractive, “Excuse me miss, do you have the time?” She reached into her purse, pulled out her cell phone, and turned it on. “2:26 am. I really should go home, I’ve been here all night.” She didn’t seem like the kind to pull an all nighter at a bar but I guess I didn’t know America. “I hear there’s a really cool circus tonight. I’m gonna go get some sleep, call me if you want to go with.” She handed me a folded up napkin with a 7-digit number on it. I’d never used a cell phone before but Tang gave me one when he sent me off to the states. I changed my watch, and realized that that was what was at 11:30. But why did they have such a scary little advertise it? So many questions came from this peaceful little town.\n\tI was exploring the town, looking through the eerie little shops, when my phone rang. It was Kent. His drunken voice boomed through the speaker. “Heyy Sang. I f-found your room key! Meet me at the bar and you can go get some sleep! Yeah? That’ll be nice right? After such a lo-“ I cut him off, “Alright Kent I’m on my way!” “Great! I’ll be waiting! 和平了!” His voice cut out as he slammed the payphone. I was glad to hear I could finally rest. After reaching the motel and getting my key I went up to my room, A15. It had one two person bed, a small box tv, an alarm clock, and a small bathroom. I lay down and set an alarm for 10. My dream was dark, with flashes of different terrifying things. The old man, dolls with oddly realistic skin, a scrawny monkey with rage in his eyes. The monkey dove at me and I snapped awake. I looked at the clock, 9:30 pm. Only a few hours of sleep. I called the girl. We decided to meet at the circus, she gave me the location and we meet at 11:30. After taking a cab up the mountainous trail we arrived at a plain that had a ring of circus tent surrounding the area, with many different tents inside.\n\tI waited until 12:30 she never showed. I walked up to the booth and bought a ticket from a man wearing one of those bird witch doctor masks. When I entered I immediately was engulfed in the stench of rotting flesh. When I looked above at the hanging lights, hanging with them were dolls, covered in flesh that looked almost human. I couldn’t be here. Every ounce of me wanted to bolt back through those gates, hail a cab, and get back to my motel. That’s what I did, well tried to do at least. I ran towards the gate when another witch doctor stepped in front of me. “All paying customers must attend” He boomed out. My eyes filled with tears. I didn’t want to be here. I looked around at all the smiling families. What was wrong with these people. After collecting myself in a nearby port-o-potty, I wandered a bit. The food looked green and the water looked yellow. The smell had ruined my appetite anyway. I approached a tent. “Astonishing Freakshow!” The sign claimed. “Prepare to be amazed!” I might as well enjoy myself the best I can. I regret walking through those tent flaps. I regret buying the ticket, coming to the states, talking to that girl, getting kissed by a drunk Kent. I regret meeting Pang. Because what I saw in that tent was something that will be cemented into my brain until the day I die. The stage was empty but the seats were filling up. I took a seat near a family and a crotchety old woman. When all seats were taken two witch doctors stepped in front of flaps and the lights went out. Up-beat piano music rang out like one of those silent films. A man came dancing out wearing a mask that was half cat half dog. He sang out, “Welcome to our show! Youre in for treat, but don’t get too scared, hang on to your seat. We promise we’re your friend, just stay till the end. And enjoy the mystical talents of what the world dragged out of hell” That didn’t rhyme. Witch doctors wheeled out a man tied to a spinning circle. The dog-cat pulled out four knives. He lined up the first and missed the man’s head by a hair. The next knife stabbed the man in the chest with a hard thump. I gasped and looked around, no one seemed phased. In fact their smiles grew. The child of the family near me stood on his chair and shouted, “Another!” The dog-cat shot another knife at the man and it sliced through his neck. Everybody cheered as the man fell limp. They wheeled him back stage. When I looked at the door, the witch doctors stared back at me. There was no escape. The room went dark for a few seconds and when they came back, there was a large blanket shrouding something cube like. The dog-cat ripped down the blanket, revealing a cage, inside was an over famished chimpanzee. They must have starved him while training. That’s when it hit me. My dream was this hell. He opened the cage and the chimp jumped out and hung on his arm. “This is my good friend Clarice.” The dog-cat announced. Clarice swung about as if she understood him. They preformed silly tricks like patty-cake and playing catch. He then pulled out a cracker and handed it to Clarice. He removed his own mask revealing a dashing young man no older than 20. He pulled her up onto his shoulder and instructed her to feed him. She held the cracker between her pointer and middle finger. She placed it gently inside his mouth but instead of pulling her hand out, she gripped his chin and ripped it clean off his face. Everybody laughed and cheered. Where was I? Is this hell? Or did that boat just take me to “FuckedUpVille” But I couldn’t leave. The man fell to his knees. Clarice jumped around and howled and let out ear splitting screams. When the lights went out she went silent. Then within a few seconds, terrifyingly high piano music snapped the silence. A much dimmer light shone right on a man. But he didn’t move nor did he have arms. Just a normal amputee anybody would think until he looked up. His eyes were sunken in and the only skin he had left was a mixture of grey and red splotches. The 4 hairs that draped around his ears were jet black. His teeth were exposed and they were black, tar covered, and cracked. What kind of monster is this? What kind of monster would put him in a showcase? I thought Mr. Dog-Cat was running the show but he’s gone now. The “another” child made the horrible mistake of stepping to the side to tie his shoes. The thing’s head snapped over to him and he sprinted with all he had at him. It stomped on the child and began to eat his face. The parents just laughed with everybody else.\n\tAfter they were removed, the up-beat music began again. A man in a suit and top hat came out, he was a magician. After doing lame average magic tricks, he called for a volunteer. I knew that whoever went up there would surely be killed, and I think they all knew that too. I stepped up. He pulled out a person in one of those “get sawed in half” tricks. He handed me a saw, “Go right ahead. Chop her up.” Those last words chilled my bones. I placed the saw on the top of it began to saw. The feet sticking out of the bottom weren’t fake like they should have been. Once I got to her, she flinched. But she didn’t react at all other than that. I had to stop. I pulled out the saw and threw it on the ground. Everybody booed and hissed. It was horrible they were all horribly angry at me. The lights went out and I felt a rag being forced into my mouth. I squirmed and kicked, but within seconds I passed out. \n\tWhen I woke up I was tied to a chair in a pitch black room. When the light above me turned on, there were too witch doctors and the girl from the bar in front of me. She leaned in close and calmly uttered 5 words into me ear. “You should have played nicely.” She walked away authoritatively. The witch doctors removed their masks and leaned in close. They were hideous. Their faces were mangled to where they looked like somebody blew up a water melon and tried to stitch back together with one hand. I don’t know what they did to me. It was the most painful thing I had ever experienced.\n\tBut now it’s my turn. I can hear their cheering voices waiting for me to put on a show. That’s what I’ll give them. When the curtains opened, my tank was wheeled out and I showed them my mermaid like tail. The freak show is all I have left."},"413":{"title":"Why didn't Australia warn the US about 9\/11?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ir7otm\/why_didnt_australia_warn_the_us_about_911\/","flair":"Trollpasta Story","author":"SpliT2ideZ","selftext":"I think it's a valid question.

In our relationship it was ready to evolve to motherhood and fatherhood and family was the next thing. A family would really make things good, and all relationships evolves to having a family. Recently things have seemed pointless and now a child will bring more purpose to my life. \n\nI am grateful because a lot of relationships don't evolve to the family part. Most relationships don't have money or they just don't feel ready. Our relationship has and I even have the time to be a father. As we got ready for the child and we made the baby room and got all the baby clothes, things were really coming back home now with us becoming a family. Normality has gone out the window and a new normal is coming in now. \n\nThen when I was in the Labor room and the baby came out, I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe that it was deaths baby and she cheated on me with death. The baby came out not being alive. How could she have done this to me and for everything we have done. It was so humiliating and we buried the baby and nobody was talking about what my wife did. \n\nThen I had to confront her and she promised that it was my baby and not deaths. I believed her as it was so sincere. Then one day I saw her going somewhere outside when she should have been at work. She went to some old building and down some cellars. In this cellar were male dead bodies who have just been recently pronounced dead. There were other women there as well, and they all reproduced with the dead male bodies. \n\nAfter a couple of days she told me we were pregnant with a child again. I confronted her and she didn't try to lie or make up excuses for what she had done. She simply said \"death deserves children!\" And she broke a few things around the house. Death reproduces through dead males. It was disgusting and we broke it off there and went our own way. \n\nI don't know what she is doing now but when I opened my eyes this morning, I was in some morgue.

Usually robbers rob people with money or valuables but I don't. I target those who don't have much at all or living on the bread line.

A lot of people don't understand me but you see what I am robbing from poor people, is not a physical monetary thing but I am robbing their love and warmth to each other. You see I come from a rich family but we have no love and warmth to each other. \n\nPoor people tend to stay together and they socialise and they have this warmth with one and another, which my rich family are missing. I robbed a lower working class family and I robbed their love and warmth to each other. When I went home it was amazing to feel the warmth and love in my own family. It only lasts for a couple of hours but it is amazing. My family are laughing and enjoying being in each other's company. When I look back at the poor working class family that I had robbed, no longer are they just poor but they have now lost the warmth and care to each other. \n\nOther rich families also pay me to rob poor people. One rich family paid me to steal from a poor family. I stole from the poor family their happiness and joy in life. I then gave it to the miserable depressed rich family and they became happy, joyous and grateful. When I rob from poor families their faith, joy, gratefulness and warmth they do tend to die no so long after. I am very good at robbing poor people, but recently I have found a new set of poor people to rob from. \n\nThere poor people in 3rd world countries who are being slaughtered and tortured, but they still have so much happiness and faith. I have been robbing them and my family and other rich families have been feeling the exhilaration of life. We have so love towards life and each other while poor tortured souls we robbed from in 3rd world countries, just whither away.

You can tell by the title that this is a story about the mythical being called Slenderman. I bet you're already shaking your head at this, ready to see what drama a teenage fan is going to type. You can go ahead and doubt this story. You can send me hate, say it's fake, and laugh at how stupid you think this story is. But it really doesn't matter what any of you do. I'm typing this for me, because I have nobody to talk to. I just need to get this off my chest, if I told anybody face-to-face they'd think I'm crazy, and you probably do too. Only two people know what's happening to me, but that's not enough. So anyways, let's start from the beginning.\n\nI'm a teenage girl, and I remember this starting off in the beginning of last summer. My parents worked constantly over the summer, leaving me alone with my twin sister, and my younger brother. For privacy, let's call my sister Ann and my brother Tom. \nI'm a introvert, I've always been. My parents never let us leave the house while they were gone, so you can guess that I spent nearly my entire summer indoors. That's when I started watching Marble Hornets. If any of you aren't familiar, Marble Hornets is basically a YouTube series based off of a being like Slenderman, called the Operator. I bet you can find tons of better explanations than mine.\nI remember binge watching the series, because at the time I was in a \"Creepypasta phase\" and I needed something to do.\nThat night is when I remember first feeling it. I'm a competitive gymnast, but I'm quitting sometime soon. Anyways, that night I was at my gym, watching the olympics with the other girls and boys who went. I suddenly remember having a feeling of being watched. I looked around the gym, until I found myself staring out the window. It was completely black outside, as it was about 9 at night. The feeling of being watched was unimaginable, and I could hear a faint ringing in my ears. But I scolded myself in my head. Just like every \"Creepypasta fan\" I wanted to become one, so I chalked it up to me just making it all up in my head. Now, I wish that was true.\nI had the feeling of being watched and horrible anxiety for weeks, and by that point I didn't even want to hear the word \"Slenderman\". I didn't know what was happening, and I had no one to talk to.\nI couldn't tell my family, so I decided to do something risky. \nMy best friend, whom I'll call Stacey, had moved away at the time, so the only way we talked was via text message. \nI remember coming back from seeing a movie (my mom was off from work that day), and I randomly decided to tell Stacey. I don't know why, because if she didn't believe me it would've ruined my relationship with her, but I was desperate for someone to talk to. I don't remember exactly what we said, as I hardly remember any of summer now a days, but I can give you a basic idea.\n\nMe: Hey Stac(my nickname for her)... Can I ask you something?\n\nHer: Yeah? What?\n\nMe: Do you believe in Slenderman?\n(It took her a good 5 minutes to respond, and I remember my heart racing. I was worried that she'd think I'm crazy, and this would be the last time we talked)\n\nHer: Why?\n\nMe: Well let's just say I've been dealing with some stuff and... I believe he's real..\n\nHer: Holy shit.... Lex (my nickname) I've been dealing with him for years... what's been happening to you?\n---------\nAnd that's when I found out that she's been stalked by Slenderman too. She's been dealing with him ever since she was 8. Part of me feels bad for telling her, as now Stacey believes that she drew Slenderman to me. But I will never blame her.\n\nI have tons of stories of all the things that have happened, but I honestly am losing my memory. My life is a mess. I haven't had a good night of sleep in months, I have horrible anxiety, and I have to see a therapist. I hate lying to the therapist, and even talking to her, but I have to pull a straight face. I'm not letting my parents find out just so they can throw me into some asylum. My friends and even my teachers have noticed how different I am, and I really don't know what to do. Soon I'm not going to be able to hide it. I hate being around people. I have zero trust for even my family, and now I don't even enjoy holidays any more. \nMy life is falling apart and I'm not even an adult yet. Hell, I'm too young to even drive.\nBut I refuse to quit. My grades in school haven't failed because i keep working hard. Part of me stills hopes, no scratch that, prays that this is all part of my imagination. That soon this will all be over. But as the days go on, I can't lie to myself anymore.\nIt's going to be Christmas soon, and I asked for a camcorder. I'm going to start recording myself at night. I'll crop out and block out anything in my room that will lead to my true identity, but I'll post any evidence that I find.\nThat's it. That's the introduction to the long line of horror that's been happening to me. I'd post more but this is already long enough, and I think I'll wait a bit. Next time I update, I'll go into further detail of the stories I've had, but for now this is it.\nThank you for reading, and I hope that you enjoyed this story.

Tomorrow i again.. started to argue with him. Then went that shocking moment, when he said. \"Faggot. Give me your address and we will sort it out\". I was around 18 at the time, so i did have responsibility, i gave him my address. He was chatting to me the entire day, arguing about god not being real. After around 3 hours.. it was about time the bell rang. I said: My parents aren't home, please go away. The man who was at the door left.

The city was called Seacity. It was built under the sea in a big dome. The people of Seacity loved entertainment but the ting they loved most was the Seacity Zoo. In the Seacity Zoo there were many exhibits, the least popular one being the sea monkeys.\n\nThere were three sea monkeys. Their names were Sally, Earl, and Ann. They were constantly abused by their hideous Seacity captors who had enslaved them as babies – taking them away from their homes to live in the zoo. They were trained to do tricks and be nice, in the process breaking many bones. Their captors were cruel and played rough with the sea monkeys. \n\nOne day there was a breach in the glass dome ceiling of the Seacity ceiling. Everything was sucked up the hole because of the pressure difference. Nothing survived except the sea monkeys. \n\nThe sea monkeys were finally free! They rejoiced and cried in their joy, but then they realized they had nowhere to go, nowhere to be, except up. They had to learn how to breathe air. They had trained how to do many other things so this wouldn’t be too much more difficult. So they slowly but surely started breathing; small shallow breaths at first, then longer better breaths.\n\nNow, I haven’t really described what sea monkeys look like. These are futuristic air-breathing sea monkeys now and were small enough to reach into ones ear canal and curl up in the palm of your hand all cute and snuggly. They were see-through and blueish in tint, but seriously the cutest things you ever saw. \n\nOnce they learned how to breathe air they needed to learn how to crawl like worms on land. This was relatively easy to learn because it was the same motion they would use to swim. \n\nNow, there is something I forgot to mention about Seacity. It was very close to the Bermuda triangle, and the city would sink many ships in order to find its meat. Normal sea monkeys ate seaweed and beautiful shellfish, but the trainers were so cruel. They took the rotting brains of the sunken humans and force fed them to the sea monkeys. They cried but sooner or later they got used to it, they just wished it wasn’t rotten, and were curious as to if it would taste better if it was fresh.\n\nOnce they reached land and started crawling on the ground, only being a couple millimeters long, they waited. They were on the Florida beaches. Thousands of hot babes floundering about, and little toddlers with their mommies. \n\n“Mommy!” said one girl, scooping up Sally, Earl, and Ann, “Lookit! They are like tiny little cute worms!” \nThe child couldn’t have been more than four. \n\nThe sea monkeys… they sniffed…\n\nWhat is that beautiful smell they exclaimed. They found it was coming from… up there. They slowly crawled up her arm, and up her shoulder, ‘til they reached just behind her ear. The smell was very strong now. They crawled inside one by one, and soon they found the glorious grey matter that was the child’s brains and started digging with their little cute incisors into her cute four year old brain. The child died in less than five minutes. By this time, the sea monkeys had grown to twice their original size.\n\nMMM WASN’T THAT SCRUMPTIOUS said Earl, YESSS said Sally. IT TRULY WAS DELICIOUS said Ann.\n\nThey burrowed through her decaying skull into the moist sand beneath, as to not be seen and at night they escaped.
