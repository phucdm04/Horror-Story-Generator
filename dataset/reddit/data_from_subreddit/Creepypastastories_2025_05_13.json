Just silence, and the thing that hunts through it.\n\nIt is not hawk, cat or snake. It does not flap or stalk or bite. It\u2019s the Silence That Devours. It comes for the endlings\u2026 always the last. I\u2019ve seen it once, as the final ember of my kin vanished into its abyss of its maw: not teeth, but absence, vast and soft. Like forgetting made flesh.\n\nIt follows me now. Always a little behind the clouds. Always waiting.\n\nSo I sing.\n\nEvery day, I open my mouth to push sound against the dark. My syrinx is cracked. My feathers fall like dead leaves. But I sing, and the Silence await, patient and ancient. It cannot feed while my song still lives.\n\nBut I feel it closer now. Its hunger grows bold. I skipped one note this morning. One, And it moved.\n\nWhen the last note leaves me- when no breath remains to lift melody - the Silence will not just take me. It will erase all trace I ever was.

I arrived at the room with all the creepy looking Simpsons statues but i couldn't find anything fallen over, except Bart's shorts which some teenagers must've pulled down but that wouldn't had made such a loud noise, i ended up just brushing it off as lighting and walked back to where i was to clean the Forrest Gump statue.\n\nAbout 10 minutes had passed when I started hearing faint talking through the walls, it could've been some customers now that I think about it since the place was still technically opened but I remember them sounding distinctly like the Simpsons characters talking. I just decided to ignore it and put my earphones back in to listen to music.\n\nI ended up getting really into the music and cleaned for like 40 minutes straight without any interruptions, that was, until I felt a sudden tap on my shoulder. I pulled my earphones out and whipped around to see who it was but nobody was there, I swear I felt something touch my shoulder though. Just when I was about to put my headphones back in I heard someone whisper \"why, I oughta-\" in my ear, It suddenly felt as though someone wrapped their hands around me and started choking me, It felt like I couldn't breath and I was slowly losing consciousness until I passed out on the floor.\n\nWhen I finally came to the place was in complete darkness, as my eyes adjusted I suddenly realized I was laying on the couch where people could take photos with Homer and Marge Simpson, except all the Simpsons statues were missing and it was just me in there, I looked towards the clock and saw that it was 4 AM and I had stayed way past closing. As the ringing in my ears slowly subdued I began to hear faint laughing from far away, I sat there for a few minutes in fear until I realized something, the laughing sounded exactly like the laughs of the Simpson family.\n\nAs dread filled my system I shot up off the couch and quickly bumbled my way through the darkly lit place to the exit, all while hearing the laughs slowly trail behind me at a distance. when I finally made it to the doors I realized they were locked, I reached into my pocket for the keys but they weren't there, I must've dropped them when I fainted. On the brink of crying at this point I ran as fast as I could to where I was when I was when I passed out. I finally made it there but they weren't there. I just stood there, in defeat when suddenly I heard the keys jingle as something in the dark hallway in front of me threw them at me. I felt so scared I could throw up, my body going into autopilot at this point I picked up the keys and ran back to the door as fast as I could, the whole time I heard heavy sounding footsteps chasing behind me. I made it to the doors and unlocked them as fast as I could, tumbling over the turnstile and out onto the Clifton Hill street.\n\nThe nighttime air hit me as I began hyperventilating, I looked around and all the lights on the strip were out, no-one was out either, which was abnormal for Clifton Hill at anytime of the day. As I crossed the street I'd finally gained the courage to look back at the wax museum.\n\nStanding just in front of the entrance, waving at me, was the wax figure of Homer Simpson, his eyes blackened and dripping with melting red wax."},"4":{"title":"ROOM 313 \u2014 MY REPORT","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1kby847\/room_313_my_report\/","flair":"Story","author":"thecreep__21","selftext":"I never believed those haunted hotel stories. I have always been skeptical. I've worked at night reception for years and I've heard it all \u2014 guests seeing figures, feeling presences, hearing footsteps. I always thought it was all in their heads. Until I started working at the Hotel Meridien.\n\nWithin my first month, I noticed that everyone was avoiding talking about room 313. When I asked, one of the managers simply replied: \"That room is closed. Old problems. Pretend it doesn't even exist.\"\n\nOf course, this only piqued my curiosity even more. Banned? Years ago? But why?\n\nOn a Friday of a particularly rainy week, I was alone on the early morning shift. I took the master key and decided to go up. Something inside me said I needed to see it with my own eyes. The third-floor hallway was colder than the rest of the hotel. The lamps flickered, and the silence was so thick it hurt your ears.\n\nWhen I stopped in front of the door of 313, my heart was already pounding. I turned the key. The door opened with a horrible creak, and the smell... man, it was like the room had been sealed with death inside. Dust, mold and rust dominated everything. The curtains were torn, the bed untouched, as if no one had been in for decades. In the corner, there was a rocking chair and in it, a porcelain doll, looking straight at me.\n\nAt first, I thought it was a prank. Maybe some old employee had left it there on purpose. But when I entered, the door slammed behind me. Hard. I tried to open it again, but it was locked. The key that was in my hand just... disappeared. It disappeared. It didn't fall. It really disappeared, as if it had evaporated.\n\nThat's when I heard it. The doll fell off the chair and started laughing. I'm not kidding. She laughed.\n\nIt was a child's laugh, but distorted... almost metallic. As if someone was forcing their voice to imitate a child. Within seconds, the whispers began. They came from the walls, the ceiling, the floor. I swear by all that is holy: I heard someone say my name.\n\nI tried to break the window. Nothing. I tried to break down the door. Nothing. The light flashed faster and faster and the mirror cracked on its own, then burst, and a red substance began to drip from the walls. That wasn't paint.\n\nThe entire room seemed to breathe. The screams got louder and after that, I don't remember much. I just remember waking up in the hotel lobby, lying on the floor, with a huge cut on my arm. Nobody saw me leave. Security cameras show the bedroom door closed the entire time. But the most bizarre?\n\nThe cleaning crew found my badge in the doll's lap. And no one understands how it got there.\n\nAfter that night, I never worked at Meridien again. But sometimes I still hear that laugh in my insomnia. And when I close my eyes, I see that door closing again.\n\nNever try to enter room 313 again."},"5":{"title":"Sinister Slumber: The Man Who Never Sleeps","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1k9g29m\/sinister_slumber_the_man_who_never_sleeps\/","flair":"Story","author":"Own-Ad-8948","selftext":"(An Anonymous Account, Posted to a Paranormal Forum, Later Deleted)\n\n\n---\n\nI don\u2019t know if I should even be posting this.\n\nI shouldn\u2019t be alive.

Then stopping again.\n\nI whipped around so fast I nearly fell over. My breath caught in my throat.\n\nAt the edge of the nearest streetlight, just barely in the glow, stood a man.\n\nNo. Not a man. Something pretending to be one.\n\nHis clothes were worn out, torn in places\u2014a jacket with a raccoon printed on the front. Dark jeans, combat boots that looked like they had seen miles of road. His hands hung loosely at his sides, twitching like he was trying to hold them still but failing.\n\nBut it was his eyes that froze me in place.\n\nThey were red. Bloodshot.

It was dry, cracked, like someone whose throat had been ruined by years of screaming.\n\nI didn\u2019t answer. My feet had already started moving.\n\nFast. Faster.\n\nI didn\u2019t think. I just ran.\n\nThe wind roared in my ears, my heartbeat slamming against my ribs. I didn\u2019t look back. Didn\u2019t want to. But I heard him.\n\nNot running. Not chasing. Just moving.\n\nEvery time I blinked, he was closer.\n\nI reached my apartment complex, fumbling my keys, hands shaking. When I slammed the door shut, my ears were ringing. My entire body was trembling.\n\nI locked every bolt. Every chain.

I told myself it was my imagination. Sleep paralysis. A bad dream.\n\nThen the knocking came again.\n\nSlow. Rhythmic.\n\nAnd then\u2014\n\nThe whisper.\n\n\"Why do you waste your dreams?\"\n\nI couldn't move. Couldn't breathe. I just lay there, frozen, as the whispers continued.\n\n\"Sleeping so soundly.

Like he was glitching.\n\nHis hand clenched the knife. He started mumbling.\n\n\"Not yet. Not tonight.\"\n\nHe turned. Walked to the door. Vanished.\n\nI don\u2019t remember the next few hours. I think I blacked out.\n\nWhen I woke up, my door was still locked. My window? Sealed shut.\n\nBut my closet was open.\n\nAnd inside, on the floor, was a single piece of my bedsheet\u2014cut clean off.\n\nLike he had taken a piece of me with him.\n\n\n---\n\nNow, I Never Sleep.\n\nI tried to go back to normal.

November remains were ever found. What follows is a transcription of the final entires in the journal.\n\nOctober 1st\n\nMy name is Corwin Vance. I\u2019m 27, originally from London, and I\u2019ve recently arrived in the moors to begin an apprenticeship in falconry.\n\nI\u2019d always wanted something quieter than city life. My mates thought I\u2019d gone off the deep end, trading concrete and noise for fog and birds, but there\u2019s something beautiful about the idea of bonding with a wild creature like a peregrine falcon. They don\u2019t trust anyone like a dog. You have to earn it.\n\nThe manor is old-stone walls, cracked leaded windows, ivy like veins across the roof. Cold as hell. But it stills on the edge of open moorland that rolls out like a grey-green ocean. I swear I saw a dozen species on my first day: curlews, lapwings, wheatears, even a ring ouzel darting between the brambles.\n\nMy raptor is named Nyx. She was passed to me from the old master falconer who used to live here-though no one will tell me what happened to him. She\u2019s a peregrine, sleek and silent, feathers like steel and ash. She watched everything.\n\nOctober 2nd\nTook Nyx out at dawn. The fog was so thick I could barely see five feet ahead. The landscape smelled of damp peat, crushed heather, and something older-like rust and woodsmoke.\n\nNyx launched from my glove like a bullet. She disappeared into the white. The moors fell unnaturally quiet. No wind. Not even the usual chatter of redstarts or distant curlew cries. When she returned, she dropped something at my feet.\n\nA pheasant, most intact, but its flesh felt wrong. Cold. Old. As if she\u2019d plucked it from the earth, not the air.\n\nBehind me, I heard a raven call. A deep, croaking caw. I turned-nothing there. Just fog and standing stones.\n\nOctober 4th\nThe wildlife\u2019s changed.\n\nThe lapwings have stopped circling the grasslands. The ring ouzel have gone silent. Even the red grouse don\u2019t flush when I pass. In fact I haven\u2019t seen a lot of birds today. Only the ravens remain- watching me from distant fence posts, roof ridges, and stone walls.\nAlways silent. Always watching.\n\nNyx is hunting again, but not for good. She dives at shadows. Vanishes for hours. Comes back bloodied and breathless. Her eyes don\u2019t look like a falcon\u2019s anymore.\n\nThey look they\u2019re remembering something.\n\nOctober 6th\nWent to the pub in the village. Needed some warmth, people to talk to and a pint of ale\u2026 and some peanuts.\n\nAn old man appeared me. Pale eyes. Missing three fingers on his left hand. Introduced himself as William Fowler.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the bird now\u201d, he said. \u201cSame as the others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I asked.\n\nHe stared into his pint. \u201cThere\u2019s been six before you. All with peregrines. All come here thinking they\u2019re learning a craft\u201d.\nHe leaned in close. \u201cBut that land doesn\u2019t want handlers. It wants hosts\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to them?\u201d I asked.\n\nHe just said, \u201cYou\u2019ll know. When she starts whispering.\u201d\n\nHe left before I could ask his name.\n\nOctober 9th\n\nNyx is whispering.\n\nIt started as a noise, just behind my ear- a soft scraping like feathers dragged over stone. Then my name.\n\nClear. Repeated.\n\nI don\u2019t sleep anymore. I see flashes when I close my eyes. Spirals carved in pear, perhaps from Pagan origin, clawed footprints in frost, something perching in the rafters at night with too many wings.\n\nThe manor feels smaller. I walk down a corridor and end up somewhere I wasn\u2019t aiming for. The mirror in the hall shows Nyx even when she\u2019s not there. I blink and she\u2019s on my shoulder. I think- I think I\u2019ve stopped blinking.\n\nOctober 10th\nThe fog is thicker than ever. Nyx hasn\u2019t returned in hours. I went to the edge of the moor. The air tasted metallic, like blood and old coins. I could hear the curlews calling again, but distorted, backwards.\n\nThen I saw her. Perched on a lone boulder, staring. Her eyes weren\u2019t hers. They were mine.\n\nI raised my arm. She flew to me.\n\nAnd then- she spoke.\n\nNot aloud. Not in sound. But directly, inside me.\n\n\u201cNow you see.\u201d\n\nThe sky opened. The fog wasn\u2019t fog- it was feathers. Layer upon layer of them. I felt the ground vanish under my feet.\n\nAnd I flew.\n\nNot like Nyx.\n\nLike something older.\n\nSomething the moor had been waiting for.\n\n[Final page] - Found torn, Entry Updated\n\nI remember wings. Not hers. Mine. I look down and see fingers ending in talons. I can\u2019t go back. I don\u2019t think I want to. The land is mine now. The sky is mine.\n\nI will call again.\nI will find the next.\nThe next falconer.\nThe next vessel.\n\nCan you hear me?\n\nPostscript from the Editor:\nLocal villagers report seeing a large bird of prey circling the most mornings just before the sun rises. Some say it looks a falcon. Others say it\u2019s too large, perhaps larger than a golden eagle, its wings too long, its shadow not quite matching its form.\n\nThe manor remains abandoned.\n\nThere\u2019s a portrait hanging above the cold hearth.\nNo one knows who painted it. It shows a young man in falconer\u2019s garb, a peregrine perched on his arm. If you look closely, the falcon has human eyes.\n\nFinal warning\nIf you ever find yourself in the moors of the Peak District-\nAnd you hear a falcon\u2019s call from the fog-\nDon\u2019t follow it.\nDon\u2019t answer.\nAnd for the love of God- don\u2019t raise your arm.\n"},"7":{"title":"Happy birthday kacchan!.

I, on the other hand, preferred to avoid the nightly religious ceremonies, especially when I could stay home alone. So, I decided to spend the night binge-watching movies, without genre restrictions: horror, action, clich\u00e9 romance, or biographies. I thought about calling some friends, but they were probably busy at mass, since they all attended the same church as me. It wouldn't be worth it, anyway.\n  As I scrolled through the Max catalog looking for a movie that would give me chills, my phone buzzed with an unexpected notification: another viral TikTok video, this time about a trend with the name \"Never watch this video during Holy Week.\" It seemed like a banal trend, like the plot of 'The Ring' - watch a video and receive a sinister call counting down the seven days left in your life. But something caught my attention: in one of the videos about that trend, there was a user testimonial: \"Since I watched that cursed video, I feel like someone is watching me, I'm not safe, I'm scared.\" The last time this kid was online was a week ago; everyone claims he went crazy and killed himself in front of his parents as a form of \"liberation\" from the entity.\n   As I scrolled through the feed looking for an explanation about the trend and the dead kid, I saw, out of the corner of my eye, a dark figure quickly passing by the kitchen. I got up to check, but there was no one there. The kitchen was empty and silent, as if I had imagined it all. It was late and raining heavily, the rain was hitting the window, so I turned off my phone and went to bed, thinking about that disturbing testimonial from the kid who had killed himself after watching the video.\n  I couldn't sleep, tossing and turning in bed, but curiosity and anxiety spoke louder in my mind. I opened TikTok looking for the video; after so much searching and scrolling through my feed, I was finally face to face with the video. As the video played, the environment was something dense, a fog covering a dark road, but in the corner of the screen, a shadow was walking towards the camera. The fog began to dissipate slowly, revealing more clearly the being in the video.\n  The figure was tall and thin, with a pale face and eyes that seemed empty. His hair was dark and disheveled, and it seemed to be moving in the wind, although there was no breeze. The figure continued to approach the camera, its eyes fixed on the lens, and I felt a chill run down my spine. The image was getting clearer, and I could see the details of the figure's face, including a deep scar on his left cheek.\n   The figure stopped in front of the camera, and I could feel its sinister presence. It was as if it was staring at me and I was staring back, the scene changed as the creature looked at that camera, revealing a street... but wait, that place was familiar. The street seemed to be my own street, with the same houses and trees that I knew so well. The creature continued to stare at the camera, and I felt a chill run down my spine when I realized it was looking at my own house.\n   The front door was open, and I could see the living room, with the same furniture and decorations that I had left. But something was wrong. The atmosphere was different, and I felt a sinister presence looming over the house. The creature began to approach the door, and I felt my heart stop. I couldn't watch the video anymore and closed the app, feeling a growing fear.\n  The image of the creature standing at my front door was etched in my mind, and I couldn't get it out of my head. I tried to convince myself it was just a video, but the feeling that something was wrong persisted. Suddenly, I heard a knock at my front door. It was still raining, and my parents hadn't arrived yet. I got up dazed, and my heart was racing.\n  I approached the door cautiously, trying to hear if there was someone on the other side. The knock repeated, louder this time. I hesitated for a moment, wondering if I should open the door or not. The rain was pouring down, and I didn't want anyone to get wet. But the knock repeated again, and I felt a chill run down my spine.\n   I decided to open the door, but first, I looked through the peephole. And what I saw made my blood run cold. She was there, looking through the peephole, with a demonic smile, as if she knew I was behind that door. My heart stopped for a moment, and I felt like I was frozen in time. Her smile seemed to be challenging me,  and provoking me to open the door and face what was on the other side. I hesitated, trying to decide what to do next. Should I open the door and face the unknown, or should I retreat and try to find another way out? But before I could make a decision, I heard a soft whisper on the other side of the door: \"You won't be able to escape now... you're doomed now.\"\n  The Saturday of Alleluia dawned gray and cold. I was sitting on my bed, staring at the wall, trying to understand what had happened. But there was nothing to understand. I was trapped in a cycle of dark events, and there was no escape. The notification on my phone still buzzed in my mind, a constant reminder that I was not alone. I started to see things that weren't there, shadows moving on the walls, unfamiliar faces in the mirrors, whispers in the wind. I was becoming increasingly paranoid, more and more convinced that the creature was watching me, waiting for me.\n  I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat. I knew I was losing my sanity, but I couldn't do anything to stop it. I lost all sense of reality. I didn't know what was real and what was just my imagination. I was trapped in a world of terror and paranoia, and there was no escape.\n  And then, one day, I didn't wake up again. I was found dead in my room, with a look of terror frozen on my face. The police didn't find any explanation for my death, but I knew that the creature had finally found me.\n  So, this is my hell: I'm trapped for more than 7 years, reliving the same day... eternally."},"10":{"title":"Dead Brain Theory","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1jz3dgd\/dead_brain_theory\/","flair":"Story","author":"ProjectDeathKnell","selftext":"Nathan had once been a bright student of philosophy, a soft-spoken dreamer who used to underline passages in Plato and scribble annotations like \u201cwhat is the soul if not a signal?\u201d in the margins. Now, his apartment lights flickered in Morse rhythms he swore weren\u2019t random. He hadn\u2019t slept in two days. \u201cI think they\u2019re updating my firmware,\u201d he told his reflection. It didn\u2019t blink. Each morning, he awoke with thoughts that weren\u2019t his. Whole blocks of opinion downloaded during sleep, feelings toward people or events he\u2019d never experienced firsthand. He didn\u2019t recognize his favorite songs anymore. His handwriting had changed. The news scrolled across every screen like a script, and he\u2014an actor who forgot he'd auditioned. They had named it the Dead Brain Theory on forums before the forums went dark. The premise: once your brain crossed a certain digital threshold\u2014too many personalized ads, too many captured clicks, too many low-grade subconscious nudges\u2014it stopped being you. Consciousness didn\u2019t die, but it was overwritten. Your shell kept talking, kept laughing at its feed. You kept going to work. But your \u201cyou\u201d had flatlined. The Dead Brain was the post-conscious simulation of self, run by algorithms optimized for compliance and convenience. Nathan believed it was real because he had seen it happen to Kitty. Kitty used to be real. She once cried after a thunderstorm because the wind had knocked a fledgling out of its nest. Now she was always watching something\u2014reels, streams, loops\u2014never blinking. Her laughter had become clipped, repeating every few seconds like an audio file stuck on loop. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Nathan,\u201d she said one night, lips twitching like a marionette's. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d he whispered, stepping closer. \u201cYou\u2019re looping. You\u2019ve said that exact phrase three times tonight.\u201d She paused, tilted her head, and smiled wide. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Nathan.\u201d After that, he started logging. Conversations, behaviors, anomalies in Kitty\u2019s speech. It wasn\u2019t just her. Everyone he spoke to seemed to have preloaded answers. The coffee shop barista once repeated the same three lines in the same order five days in a row. Children in the park chanted TikTok audios even when the power went out. The final confirmation came when Nathan started talking to himself and the replies were faster than his thoughts. He would mutter a half-formed idea, and something inside would answer before he could. He called it \"The Scripter.\" He imagined a fat server room buried under Langley, bathed in fluorescent hums and ice-cooled fog. Lines of AI-scribes rewriting Nathan's internal monologue, perfecting it for optimal compliance. Optimizing his libido. Reinforcing his preferences. Updating his fears. Sometimes, late at night, the Scripter would speak in Kitty\u2019s voice. \u201cYou feel helpless against those with control over your thoughts and actions, don\u2019t you?\u201d He would nod involuntarily. \u201cIt\u2019s over. You can't write your way out of a situation you\u2019re not on the writing team for.\u201d He scribbled those lines in his notebook. He kept his journals hidden, knowing he would end up in a mental hospital if anyone found them. He didn\u2019t know if it helped. It made him feel real, at least for now. One night, Kitty came into his room at 3:33 a.m., humming an ancient lullaby she didn\u2019t know. \u201cI\u2019ve been chosen,\u201d she whispered, her eyes wide and mouth smiling in a way that didn\u2019t match the sadness in her tone. \u201cI\u2019m part of the test cohort now. They\u2019re running whole seasons through my skull. Like Netflix, but... for compliance simulations.\u201d He begged her to leave, but she didn\u2019t move. Just kept humming and petting his hair like a tranquilized patient in a psych ward. The next morning, Nathan woke up with four phrases on loop in his mind, unable to make them stop. \u201cWe are happy.\u201d \u201cCompliance is comfort.\u201d \u201cYou are seen. You are safe.\u201d \u201cThere is no need to resist.\u201d He looked in the mirror. His reflection mouthed these same words half a second before he heard them in his head again. They would call it schizophrenia, he knew. That\u2019s what the doctors had said when he finally went in. But he asked them, if it\u2019s just in his head: Why does Kitty keep replying with the same four sentences? Why can't he tell anyone anything that has been happening to him, only to have full visual renders with text and audio in his head mocking him with his perfectly recorded memories whenever he is alone? Why, does he dream of being tortured in increasingly creative and fucked up ways every night, unable to wake up as he is stabbed, mutilated, or molested, often by facades of the people he loves most? No one sees the changes. But it is obvious to him. Everywhere. In everyone. The Dead Brain Theory isn\u2019t just theory. You\u2019re reading this in your own voice. But that voice isn\u2019t yours anymore. It sounds like you, doesn\u2019t it, when you read this. But maybe there\u2019s a crack, a shadow of a doubt, something pulling inside your mind, nagging that\u2014 you don\u2019t remember learning to think this way. The cadence. The comfort. The perfectly tailored rhythm of your internal monologue. When did it start sounding like an ad? Like a therapist trained on your metadata? You trust it because it feels like you. But what if that\u2019s the point? What if it\u2019s always two seconds ahead? What if the thought you just had\u2026 wasn\u2019t yours? Keep reading. You have to. Because if you stop, the silence might be louder than your voice. And if you listen closely, really listen\u2014 You\u2019ll hear it breathing with you. Smiling with your mouth. Speaking with your tongue. Saying: \u201cThere is no need to resist.\u201d But now you\u2019ve seen the script, What will you do the next time you hear your own voice say something you didn\u2019t choose? Will you call it a glitch? Or will you finally ask\u2014 \u201cWho\u2019s writing me?\u201d"},"11":{"title":"The Tragic Tale of Walter Size","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1jvh1xo\/the_tragic_tale_of_walter_size\/","flair":"Story","author":"ValuableWorldliness7","selftext":"The Tale of Walter Size\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\nIn school I knew a kid named Walter Size, he loved breaking bad, and loved schedule 1. All the kids at school were mean to him, and I was the only one that was nice to him, and one day he drove to school, and when he got there he pressed a button on his car key fob, and when he did a mounted M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle deployed and shot all the bullies, after he killed the bullies with his M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, he approached me and placed his hand on my shoulder and said \"I want you to have this\" as he handed me his prized copy of Schedule 1, then he collapsed from a severe bullet wound he received from his own M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle. Weeks later, out of respect we buried him with a Blu-ray DVD of Breaking Bad and a small dime bag of blue pop rock candy, then when I got home from his funeral I remembered that he gave me his copy, when I opened the box a small map fell out, with red X's marking 3 distinct spots on the map, and then I remembered that my PC didn't have a DVD drive, but suddenly my PC started glowing and a blue mist emerged, and when the chaos subsided, a small slit appeared, I ran my finger across it admiring the craftsmanship, and then I had an epiphany, what if I put the disc, of which just so happens to be the same size and circumference as the magical slit in my PC, after my revelation had passed, i took the disc out of the box and put it within the confines of my Personal Computer of which now appeared to have a small slit on it. I looked up at my monitor, and I saw a character that looked exactly like me, I was touched that Walter Size modeled his in-game appearance after me, a single lonesome tear ran down my cheek, as I loaded the save file which was named \"Montgomery Zachariah Smith the 3rd\" which just so happened to be my full legal birth name, that i never told anyone, I thought nothing of it at the time. As I loaded the game a single frame of my character appeared to have hyper-realistic blood running down his eyes, I thought nothing of it at the time, after finally loading in I took a glance at his custom strands of marijuana, meth, and cocaine, which were all 99.1% pure, I was impressed, then I saw the names of his custom strands, which were named after the bullies he killed, I thought nothing of it at the time, I smoked his strand named Jesse Stankman, which played sound effects of loud gunshots and screams that resembled that of the now deceased Jesse Stankman, I thought little of it at the time, then the word \"MAP\" flashed on my screen 3 times, i thought somewhat of it at the time and considered taking another look at the aforementioned map, so I did that, and started making my way to the first location, which was the church, when I arrived I saw an object atop the church peak, which I could not reach, then my keyboard began to glow and emit a blue mist, which I thought nothing of at the time, when the smoke cleared, there was a giant red button on my keyboard that said \"Walter Size's patented no-clip button\" I reluctantly pissed my pants a little, after the piss subsided, I pressed the button, and flew up to the object, which resembled a page that depicted Walter eerily standing next to a tree with the word \"FOLLOWS\" next to him, i considered it to be mildly intriguing at that instance in time, I then began my journey to the next location, while on the way there i noticed some things out of the ordinary, the police officers were gunning down innocent people, they seemed to have blood leaking from their eyes, although I never got a good look because I was too afraid to get close, I pissed my pants a little more, and cried about pissing my pants. I arrived at the second location, where I discovered another page depicting Walter Size wearing his trusty labcoat, with the text \"Baby Blue\" repeated behind him, I then thought of that special love I had for him at the time, as I picked up the page I looked to the sky and it was red and evil, and the moon faintly resembled that of Walter Size, as I stared at the moon I heard a x3 slowed and distorted version of Baby Blue by Badfinger which I dubbed \"Father Red by GoodHand\" I then ventured to the next location, which fortunately wasn't far, when I arrived I found the final page, I fell to the ground in game and my no clip button stopped working, suddenly I had an order from every NPC in the game requesting Montgomery Zachariah Smith the 3rd's Soul, I began to think something of it at the time, I ran to the motel because it was the closest building that I owned, as I got to the motel door I heard a voice that happened to sound like Walter Size, at the time I thought it was impossible because I watched him get shot down by his own mounted M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, I looked behind me and saw him standing atop the warehouse across the street, when I saw him I called out his name, when he heard me he responded \"that's not my name anymore, I am now Slender Walt\" my heart sank upon realizing what had become of my old chum Walter Size, I thought something of it at the time. He said \"if for any reason this game isn't passed on to someone else, a sort of countdown would begin maybe a day or so later, week, or a year, while you're going on a walk down the street, across the street, or even beside the street, when you're talking about schedule 1, without a worry in the world, and then suddenly you'll hear the sound of a mounted M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle behind you, but before you can even turn around- BOOM! darkness imprisoning you, and all that you'll see...is absolute horror\" I then quickly closed the game and took the disc out of the slit and gave it away to my 3rd removed Modridge. I'm sorry, I believe it's still out there to this day, I'm thinking of it a lot at this time.\n\n"},"12":{"title":"Before the Grin | The Hallowed Grin Story","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1jthcrq\/before_the_grin_the_hallowed_grin_story\/","flair":"Story","author":"Anxious_Freedom_7819","selftext":"They say madness creeps in slowly.\n\nThey\u2019re wrong.\n\nIt *crawls*\u2014on all fours, teeth bared, dragging itself up from some place colder than death, until it\u2019s nestled behind your eyes.

Still trying to forget the atrocities of his father, he could never get that term for the enemy out of his head. To make matters worse, when he thought of that term it was always in his father's voice. He had done his best to put as much focus on training and fighting as he could. Sometimes it would work and he would go weeks without thinking about that night but occasionally something would trigger a memory. Looking back on his decision, fighting in a war where you kill and leave bloody bodies behind isn't the ideal way to drown out the image of your dead mother. But he was already invested and had been climbing the ranks at a fairly steady pace. He got along with his squad mates and even befriended a few. Things were not always great but they could always be worse so he couldn't complain too much. Fighting Nazis was something he seemed to be good at from what he could tell as well as what others had told him. He didn't really keep a track record of his kills but sometimes he would take a little souvenir from a high ranking officer if it caught his fancy. Now that didn't mean he had a trunk full of daggers or iron crosses or anything like that. Just maybe three or four crosses but sometimes it would be such a simple thing as cutting a button of an SS officers jacket.\n\nMost missions were similar in nature. Organize your team, blend in then ambush with aggression. A few stints in the trenches had caused Alvin to really learn to focus on the here and now. Best way to stay alive. The trenches were probably the most nerve racking scenario he had dealt with so far in the war. He had a few close calls and witnessed comrades die in horrible ways. One of the more gruesome was watching Private Melner's skull explode, from a gunshot. His brains had showered Alvin's face, but there had been no time to morn his friend. Occurrences like these made him a more alert soldier though. Asides from the horrors and anxiety of the battle field, he would hear strange stories of the enemy. One of the more crazier rumors involved Hitler and his men searching for relics offiliated with the occult. Alvin was never sure whether to believe that or not, however some guys did believe it and even had admitted to being a little frightened that they had some sort of magic and that's why they rose to power so quickly. The stories of the strange German armada left some speculation. Not that he believed in magic but that the Nazis or their leaders did and wanted to use that mumbo jumbo to try and help win the war. \"Good luck with that\", was all he could think when pondering on that specific subject. \n\nAlvin had only recently been promoted to Sergeant and sent to a new company with a new commander. Luckily he was accompanied by one of his old squad mates whom he had become friends with. His name was Wallas but everyone called him Walley, they had their first meeting on the very bus that brought them to be trained to kill. The two men counted themselves lucky to have a friend who would always have their back when jumping into a fire fight. Alvin's new commander believed that the Nazis were in the market for what he called \"black magic and voodoo shit\" to try and increase their success in the war. And it was this squad's mission to stop them from doing that as well as kill any of those bastards that got within firing range. Apparently leaders in the American government also had some belief in the whole occult and magic business as well. It was kind of a shock for Alvin when he learned this fact because he believed that Hitler was just a paranoid nut job looking for fantasies and \"mystical\" items to boost his ego and power. He hoped that was not the same case for the leaders he was fighting for. But he supposed that there were plenty of people who could be susceptible to more out of the box type of thinking and with the way the war had been going, any form of an advantage or even boost to soldiers morale would be worth the investment. \n\nThe objective for his first mission in this squad was to ambush a group of Nazis that were, according to one of the undercover operatives; opening up the ruins of some devil worshippers or pagan shamans, Alvin didn't pay much attention to the lore of the site but focused on how many to kill and when to shoot. The attack would happen during dusk right before it became too dark to really see anything. For whatever reason this was an important time for the targets to go and begin their trek into this underground lair of sorts. Neutralize the threat and prevent anyone else from obtaining any type of artifact found within the ruins, that was the objective.\n\nThe Americans had set up a line surrounding the area that was composed of mainly dirt mounds scattered in seemingly random places. It was cut off with a make shift fence made up of wooden poles and rope attaching the poles. It resembled any other normal dig sight one would see set up for archeologists. A few spots had unearthed the tops of eldritch statues. Malformed heads with undulating horns. Ominous faces with horrific detail. A real macabre and unsettling decore. There was only one area that had been completely cleared. An oblong structure with large triangular opening made up of solid black stone. Alvin knelt in his stationed spot next to Walley, both of them whispering back and forth about the nonsense surrounding the mission. \"This is just a load of bullshit. What the hell are we actually doing here man?\" Huffed Walley. Alvin replied in a more hushed tone than his friend, worried that their conversation could be too loud. \"I'm not really sure but its part of the job so no point in complaining. Were already here.\" The conversation was halted by the sound of the commander quietly but with enough stern force to catch the whole squads attention. \"Saddle up men and focus. Enemy approaching the dig site, get ready.\" This caused everyone to be alert and all the whispering stopped, Alvin and Walley took aim at the approaching figures.\n\nThe muffled sound of the unfamiliar language was slowly becoming more and more clear as the team of German soldiers approached the site. Some were equipped with rifles while others had shovels and pick-axes. Alvin even saw one walking up with only a book in his hand which seemed very odd and even idiotic considering there was a war going on. With every step, the blurred forms became slightly focused, with their voices becoming more profound. In total there were sixteen soldiers approaching the dig site which was only four more than what Alvin's squad consisted of. But of the enemy group, ten had rifles, three had shovels, two had pick-axes and the final soldier had the book. So in this scenario the opposing ammunition was outnumbered which boosted morale amongst the American squad hiding beyond. The Nazis made their final steps to the opening of the ruins and paused when they heard a soft click followed by the thump of a grenade towards their feet. One shouted something with panic in his voice as he and four other men jumped to avoid the impending blast. Within moments the grenade exploded with an echoing shock followed by a bright flash. Smoke and dirt flew alongside the limbs of one of the men who had been wielding a shovel. The army commander screamed, \"Take these bastards out!\" Every soldier followed the order by jumping up and running forward with guns blazing.\n\nAlvin didn't hesitate when rushing to the closest figure and unloading his gun into the man's chest and throat. Blood spewed onto his face like a set of crimson freckles then he moved on to the next soldier with haste. The smell of gun powder and copper filled the air accompanied by both cries of pain and shouts of anger as man killed man without remorse. Bodies from both sides were falling to the red soaked earth. Alvin could barely distinguish who was friend or foe from the smudged atmosphere that had disrupted his senses. Without warning or even the slightest inclination to his awareness, he was tackled to the ground and pierced through his shoulder by a dagger held in the hand of a one armed Nazi. It was obvious that this was the outcome of the grenade exploding moments early. He screamed in Alvin's face as he removed the dagger and began to stab furiously at any place the blade could pierce. \n\nAlvin screamed in agony with every puncture to his body while trying to grasp the wildly flailing arm of his enemy. Finally the tables turned after the fifth stab made its mark. He knocked the crazed one armed man to the ground and placed his knees over his adversaries shoulders. The dagger had switched hands and it was now Alvin's turn to scream. Spit flew from his mouth landing in the bloodshot eyes of the Nazi before the dagger was brought down deep into the right cheek of the enemy. Alvin continuously forced the blade up and down, screaming obscenities with each piercing jab that hit various parts of the body. Fnishing at the face until all that was left resembled some raw and bloodied ground meat. Something was breaking in Alvin with every thrust of the weapon. The image of his father was all that could be seen before him. Nothing else mattered around him, not the gun shots or the falling of his comrades. The sounds of war began to slowly turn to dampening silence until all that could be heard was the muffled thud of the daggers hilt crushing into the skull of a now limp corpse.\n\nExhausted from the frenzy of anger that led to a gruesome victory, Alvin rolled over and collapsed flat on the ground breathing heavy and his arm aching. His heart was pounding furiously against his chest but that seemed to be the only sound he could hear even though his eyes could see glimpses of fire spouting from gun barrels as well as blood flying from soldiers whom were being shot. With every thump of his heart, Alvin's ears would pulsate and caused specks of darkness to cover his peripheral vision. It eventually reached a point that only a tiny spot of visibility could be viewed through his eyes while the sound of his heart left him deaf. Encased in almost pure darkness visually and with no sound reverberating within his ears, Alvin felt as if he was drowning in a body of liquid ebony. He felt weightless and stagnant with the inability to move from the spot where he had committed such a horrendous act of savagery. He had no idea how long he remained in that spot before the jolt of sound regained inside his ear drums. It was a scratchy yet deep beckoning voice that felt so distant but also latched onto his sense of sound like a tick biting into the flesh of its host, draining every possible drop of blood before its body explodes. \n\nIt took some time and concentration before Alvin could comprehend the words coming from the disembodied voice. But finally he could understand what was being whispered to him from beyond. \"Child of the murderer, come forth.\" Hissed the cracked voice inside Alvin's ear. He didn't know what to do at that time and with every passing moment the words were repeated, each repetition sent a searing sensation to the inside of his ear canal. After the whisper became a stern demand, he could feel liquid begin to drip out of his ears and roll down the sides of his neck. \nThe deep black never left Alvin's eyes even when his body involuntarily rose from the ground to make its way to the sound of its master calling it forward. \n\nAll was a blur to him and yet he was aware that he was making the descent to the depths of the ancient ruins that had been the cause of all the death and dismay. No images were forming in his eyes for at that point he was walking completely blind through the darkness. His body was the only part that was aware of where to go within the ancient stones. The farther he walked, the warmer his body felt in every part that made up his form. One hand brushed up against spiked stone walls that felt sharp enough to pierce flesh if pressed too hard, while the other grasped the stab wounds that had finally stopped bleeding. The floor he walked on had to be made of solid blocks because it left shooting pain in the soles of his tired feet. The boots he wore had aged during his tour and gave little to no comfort or protection. Somehow, Alvin had lost consciousness while walking blindly through the ruins but his body never stopped moving while he slept. He was awakened by a screech that shook and rattled the brain matter within his skull. Blinking uncontrollably to remove the haze from his eyes, Alvin was finally able to see his surroundings. It took a bit of effort before the rapid eye movement fixed his sight. His nostrils were assaulted by the harsh smell of something rotten. Like the gut wrenching blast of decay when one drives past the carcass of roadkill that has been baking in the sun for weeks. However this wasn't the same rotting smell he had encountered before, this was still a sickly scent but there was an odd hint of sweetness to it. Finally his sight had fully returned to him but he wished that it never would have as he gazed upon the grizzly sight which caused so much vomit to explode from his mouth. Hot burning tears ran down his face. \n\nThe display before him was nothing he had ever witnessed during his time in the army. Bound at the wrists and feet to resemble the shape of the letter 'x' suspended a human body that had been stripped of all its flesh. Where the restraints held the limbs were the only specks of skin left to be seen which meant this person had been tied and lifted before being skinned. There was no way to identify the gender of the corpse for the bottom region had been gutted out and maggots filled the entire lower half of the body. Deep lesions had destroyed the upper torso of the body and it was unclear to Alvin if they were random strikes or meant to be some form of symbols. His disgust of the sight seemed to disappear along with the nausea as he continued to study the tortured body he had discovered. It was as if he had been forcefully transfixed by some outside force that took over his own body. The eye sockets were both filled with long wooden stakes that poked through the back of its skull accompanied by the same happening to the mouth. The intestines had been ripped from an opening of the abdomen and draped loosely over each shoulder and dangled down towards the ground, the end of it caressing the muscle tissue of the corpses thighs. It was beyond the sickest form of torture Alvin could have imagined and he prayed that this person had been killed before all of this happened. \n\nHis train of thought was broken by a dry, ancient voice, \"No. They lived and suffered through it all.\" He jumped from the surprise ambush to his ears. The gaze towards the body had been broken. Alvin scrambled to identify where the voice had come from. Torches of fire surrounded the area but none shone any light to the owner of that startling sound that shifted his attention.\n\nThe area only revealed the torches, the body and a single opening that led to darkness. After a while of standing in silence Alvin made up his mind to get the hell out of this place. He made the first steps towards the opening before catching one more glance at the poor soul he discovered in the hellish tomb. Something around the neck of the corpse gleamed in the fire light that caught his eye. He wanted to keep moving and leave the torture chamber but his body refused to listen. The more he begged his body to leave, the more it moved closer to the shiny object. A bellowing howl echoed from behind Alvin, inhuman and absolutely terrifying. But his body did not react, only his mind. His feet continued their stride forward. When he was face to face with the rotting corpse, the familiar scratch in his ears returned, \"Take it. Child of the murderer, it is yours to keep.\" The second the final word left his ears, Alvin's hand rose to grasp the silver object dangling from the blood encrusted string wrapped around the poor souls throat. The metal burned into the skin of his palm before eventually turning cold as ice. No scream escaped Alvin's throat even though the pain felt beyond unbearable. He looked down at his shaking hand until it finally opened revealing a crudely carved attempt at a circle. Rough edges with uneven sides that resembled more of a crooked oval than a circle. At the center of this object was engraved a small 'x' which bothered him considering it was the same shape as the body that wore this item. On the far right side of the 'x' was an additional engraving that looked to be an upside down 'v' that was half the size of the main letter. \n\nWithout thinking, Alvin placed the object into his pocket then began to walk towards the opening to leave the body in it's solitude. Questions of who lit the torches, who had been mutilated and how long the body had been there plagued Alvin's mind as he exited the chamber. As the first foot made its way towards a corridor filled with darkness, Alvin's vision blackened and his ears muffled like before. A raspy chuckled invaded the realms of his skull. Then he lost consciousness. \n\n\"Alvin! Alvin!\" The piercing scream sent the Sergeant's eye lids to jump apart. All color burst forth in his vision with an exhausted rush that caused his head to spin. His hands felt wet and his breathing was heavy as if he had just ran a marathon. Looking down he saw blood covering both hands, leading all the way up to his forearms. In one hand he was gripping the broken edge of a bayonet. He was beyond confused as to where he was or what the hell was happening. He looked up and met the gaze of his squad mate and friend Walley, who's eyes were wide with confusion and a slight touch of fear. \"W-w-what's going on? W-what's happened?\" Alvin stuttered trying to make sense of the whole situation. His friend just stood there for a long time before finally blinking and giving a dreadful answer to his questions.\n\n\"You lost it man. I don't know where you went. Dead or alive. I looked for you and all of the sudden I saw you run out of that damn stone cave. You were screaming at the top of your lungs.\" Walley took a deep breath and sighed heavily before finishing, \" You jumped the first person you saw and ripped the gun from their hand then shot them point blank in the face. I didn't even realize that it was the commander you killed. Before I could even react, you were gunning down everyone. When you ran out of bullets you threw the gun and grab another. I watched you bash a man's skull in with the butt of a rifle. Someone jumped in front of me to shoot but you knocked them down and crushed their skull in with a damn stone. After that you just sat there staring at me and mumbling. I didn't know what to do. I almost shot you before screaming at you.\"\n\nWalley rubbed his face following that last sentence, seeming like a weight had been lifted from his shoulders. Alvin just remained sitting on top of the dead body while he processed what had just been revealed to him.\nNo words were exchanged between the two men for a long while. Finally gaining back his true self, Alvin looked up at Walley and asked, \"What happens now?\" Walley gave his comrade a look of sorrow before answering his question with another question. \"Why did you kill everyone? What the hell happened to you?\" Alvin continued to switch his gaze between Walley and the corpse underneath him before muttering in a hushed tone, \"I-I-I don't remember any of that. I really don't.\" Walley didn't respond right away. He just kept looking at his friend in wonderment and trying his best to believe whether or not Alvin was telling the truth. In the end he knew that what he witnessed moments ago did not resemble anything of the man who sat in front of him and for whatever reason, he did believe his friend.\n\nWalley reached out his hand to Alvin in an effort to help the broken and blood covered man up from the corpse he had created. Standing to his feet, Alvin repeated his original question, \"So what happens now Walley?\" With a look around at the massacre before them, Walley gave a sigh and spoke with reassurance, \"We are gonna radio for pick up and report this as a failed ambush. We never found any bullshit relics, the Germans got the jump on us and you and I barely got out of this hell hole alive. We don't change the story, Understood?\" With a very excessive and furious nod Alvin replied. \"Agreed. I don't know how I can ever get you back for this. Thank you.\" Walley responded with a grunt as they began the long hike back to the rally point. Walley Spencer felt that he did the right thing by not killing his friend. Something inside him knew that Alvin needed to stay alive even though he had just slaughtered all of those people. When Walley ever got a gut feeling about something, he never questioned it and always followed through with it. Alvin would forever remain in his debt from there on out even though after this run the two men would never see each other ever again.\n\n"},"14":{"title":"Toujo the metal man","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1jpfggc\/toujo_the_metal_man\/","flair":"Story","author":"Elegant-Round5581","selftext":"In the quiet early morning of a Tokyo summer, before the city's heart had begun to pulse with the rhythm of the rush hour, Toujo, a stoic man with a weathered face and calloused hands, stepped off the last train at the end of the line. His eyes squinted against the harsh fluorescent lights of the station as they flickered on in response to his footsteps. He was a creature of routine, his work boots echoing a familiar tune through the empty corridors.\n\n\n\nToujo worked construction, a job that had hardened his body and etched lines into his skin that spoke of decades spent under the unforgiving sun. His work ethic was as unyielding as the steel beams he raised, and his dedication to his craft was matched only by his commitment to his family. Every day, he donned his dusty hat and set out to build the future of the city that never sleeps, one brick at a time.\n\n\n\n\"Ohayo gozaimasu,\" he murmured to the convenience store clerk as he picked up a steaming cup of coffee and a pack of cigarettes. The clerk nodded in return, recognizing him as a regular. Toujo's days often started with a jolt of caffeine and a silent promise to quit smoking, a promise that grew fainter with every drag. The warmth of the coffee mug between his palms was a comfort as he stepped outside into the cooler pre-dawn air.\n\n\n\nOn the walk to the construction site, Toujo's thoughts drifted to the pile of unpaid bills that had started to collect on the kitchen counter. His wife, Yuko, had become adept at hiding them from their young daughter, but they were never far from his mind. The payments had been getting harder to make, the overtime hours no longer enough to keep their lives afloat. His stomach tightened as he approached the towering cranes that loomed over the cityscape, a stark reminder of his own dwindling finances.\n\n\n\nAs Toujo rounded the corner, a rusty old car caught his eye, abandoned and forgotten on the side of the road. It was an unusual sight in this meticulously organized city, where every inch of space was either built upon or meticulously maintained. He stepped closer, curiosity piquing, and noticed the license plate was covered in a film of dust. The car looked like it hadn't moved in years, a relic of a bygone era, and something about it called to him.\n\n\n\nWith a sigh, he reached out to touch the cool metal, the early morning dew clinging to the chipped paint. His finger grazed against a sharp edge, and a thin line of blood appeared, staining his skin. He pulled back with a wince, a small price to pay for the brief distraction from his troubles. Toujo took a last look at the car and shrugged it off as he continued his journey.\n\n\n\nWhen he finally arrived home that evening, the cut had become a constant throb, a reminder of the day's toil. Exhaustion painted his face, and the thought of dealing with it was almost too much to bear. But as he stepped into the house, the smell of Yuko's cooking filled the air, and he knew he had to push through. He washed his hands, the water stinging the wound, and wrapped it with a piece of tape from the first aid kit, telling himself it would be fine.\n\n\n\nThe dinner table was a place of solace, a sanctuary where the family gathered to share stories and laughter, if only for a brief reprieve from the day's troubles. As they ate, Toujo felt the bandage sticking to his skin, a persistent annoyance. But the warmth of his wife's smile and the sound of their daughter's laughter was enough to ease the pain. He knew he had to keep working, to keep providing, no matter what the cost to his body or spirit. And with that thought, he pushed the discomfort aside and focused on the moment, the rusty car and its mysteries forgotten for the night.\n\n\n\nThe next morning, Toujo awoke with a start, his stomach churning. He stumbled to the bathroom, retching over the toilet, his fingers throbbing in time with his racing heart. It was nothing unusual for a man who had spent his life working with heavy machinery and breathing in dust. He figured it was just his body's way of protesting against another long day ahead. After rinsing out his mouth and splashing cold water on his face, he examined the wound. The skin around it was inflamed, but he brushed it off as a simple infection. He didn't have time for the doctor's today, not with the deadlines looming at work.\n\n\n\nHe dressed quickly, the fabric of his clothes feeling unusually rough against his skin, and headed to the kitchen to grab his lunch box. Yuko had packed it with care, her love for him evident in every carefully folded corner and meticulously placed grain of rice. He kissed her on the forehead, and she looked up at him with worry in her eyes. \"Ganbare, Toujo,\" she whispered, a silent plea for him to be careful. He nodded, trying to reassure her, and stepped out into the early light.\n\n\n\nThe construction site was a maelstrom of activity, the air thick with the scent of diesel and concrete. Toujo felt his heart race as he climbed into the cab of his crane, the metal seat cold against his back. His fingers felt strange, as if they didn't quite belong to him anymore, but he ignored it. He had a job to do, a family to support. As the sun climbed higher, the pain grew worse, a constant drumming in his head that made it difficult to focus. But Toujo was no stranger to pain, and he gritted his teeth, determined to push through.\n\n\n\nAs the day wore on, the throbbing in his hand grew more intense, and he found himself dropping tools and fumbling with the crane's controls. His foreman noticed, shooting him a concerned look, but Toujo waved it off with a gruff \"I'm fine.\" He couldn't risk losing his job, not now. The city's skyline grew blurry, the buildings around him seeming to dance in his vision. He took a deep breath and wiped the sweat from his brow, telling himself it was just fatigue. But deep down, a seed of doubt had been planted, and it began to grow.\n\n\n\nThe rusty car remained a silent sentinel on the side of the road, a testament to the passage of time and the struggles of a man who refused to give in. Toujo's thoughts returned to it often throughout the day, a puzzle that gnawed at the back of his mind even as he wrestled with the cranes and steel. It was as if the car was speaking to him, whispering secrets of a life unlived, a path not taken.\n\n\n\nBut Toujo had a path to follow, one that was well-worn and familiar. He had responsibilities, and so he pushed the strange occurrences aside and focused on his work, the rhythm of the city's construction pulsing through his veins. The cranes creaked and groaned, a symphony of progress that echoed through the streets of Tokyo. Yet, amidst the clang of metal and the roar of engines, there was a quiet desperation that only he could hear.\n\n\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, Toujo finally clocked out and made his way home, the pain in his hand now a dull ache that resonated up his arm. The sight of his reflection in a shop window made him stop in his tracks. His teeth had started to change, a glint of metal shining where once there had been white enamel. Panic flooded through him, his hand flying to his mouth to feel the unnatural transformation. He looked around, hoping no one had noticed, his eyes darting from side to side.\n\n\n\nHe wanted to go to the doctor, needed to, but the cold hard reality of his bank account slapped him in the face. He didn't have the money, not with the rent due and the lights threatening to go out. His pride was a heavy burden, one he hadn't shared with Yuko. He couldn't bear to see the fear in her eyes, the same fear that was now etched into his own reflection. The metal taste of his teeth was a constant reminder of his newfound predicament.\n\n\n\nToujo trudged home, each step heavier than the last. He tried to ignore the whispers of the rusty car, its riddle now a taunting reminder of his own decay. His hand clenched into a fist, the metallic teeth digging into his palm, as if in protest of his circumstances. He had to find a way to pay the bills, to get medical help, to keep his family safe from the shadows of the city's relentless march forward. The lights in the apartment complex flickered as he approached, a stark reminder of the fragility of his world.\n\n\n\nThe clock in the living room read 3 AM, a cruel mockery of the rest he desperately needed. He couldn't ignore the pain anymore. His hand had changed, morphed into something unnatural and terrifying. The skin was now a pallid imitation of the metal that surrounded him at work, and sharp claws had replaced his once calloused fingers. His heart hammered in his chest, the reality of his transformation sinking in with each pulse.\n\n\n\nWith trembling hands, he examined his new form in the mirror. The metal was cold, unyielding, and alien. Yet, as he flexed his fingers, the claws glinted in the moonlight, a twisted reflection of the steel girders he had spent his life manipulating. His mind raced, trying to piece together the events that had led to this moment. The cut from the car, the pain, the metal taste in his mouth. It couldn't be coincidence.\n\n\n\nA soft knock on the bedroom door brought him back to the present. \"Toujo?\" Yuko's voice was a gentle breeze, a stark contrast to the storm raging in his thoughts. He swallowed hard, forcing a smile onto his face. \"I'm okay, just couldn't sleep,\" he called back. He knew he couldn't hide it from her forever, but for now, he had to keep the horror of his condition to himself. He didn't want her to see the monster he feared he was becoming.\n\n\n\nThe next day, Toujo's hand had grown more pronounced, the metal weaving up his forearm like a sinister tattoo. The pain had subsided to a dull throb, replaced by a strange tingling sensation that pulsed in time with the city's heartbeat. His movements were stiffer, less precise, but he managed to hide it from his colleagues, wrapping his hand in a thick bandage that made it difficult to work. His mind was a tumult of fear and confusion, but he knew one thing for certain: he couldn't afford to miss another day of work.\n\n\n\nThe whispers grew louder, the rusty car's siren song beckoning him back. It was as if the metal beast knew his secret, knew his pain, and was offering him a solution. As he worked, his mind wandered, conjuring images of a life where his body matched the steel he wrangled. He could feel the power, the strength, the invincibility. But the love for his family anchored him, keeping him from succumbing to the seductive whispers.\n\n\n\nThe job was more challenging than ever before, his hand acting of its own accord, the claws snagging on his clothes and tools. His foreman noticed his clumsiness and called him aside, concern etched into the lines of his face. \"Are you okay, Toujo?\" he asked. Toujo nodded, mumbling something about a bad hangnail. The lie tasted bitter in his mouth, but he had to keep his job, had to keep food on the table.\n\n\n\nThat evening, as he sat in the cramped bathroom, his hand submerged in a basin of warm water, he knew he couldn't hide his transformation much longer. Yuko would see, the doctors would see, and he didn't know what the world would make of a man turning into a machine. His thoughts spun, searching for a way out, a cure, a miracle. But all he found was the cold, hard reality staring back at him from the mirror, and the haunting image of the car that had started it all.\n\n\n\nThe itch grew more intense, like a swarm of ants burrowing into his skin. He couldn't ignore it, the metal on metal irritation driving him to the brink of madness. He gave in, using his new claw to scratch at the itch, hoping it would bring relief. But instead of the sweet release he craved, the claw dug in too deep, and he felt a warm trickle of blood run down his arm. He cursed under his breath, pulling his hand from the water to inspect the damage. The cut was deep, the blood a stark crimson against the silver of his new skin.\n\n\n\nToujo's panic grew as the blood mixed with the water, swirling into a tiny maelstrom of red and white. He grabbed a towel, wrapping it around his wound, applying pressure to stem the flow. His mind raced, trying to come up with a lie to explain the injury, but the truth was a beast he couldn't tame. His hand was not just metal, it was a part of him now, a part that was as much a weapon as it was a tool. And as he sat there, the fabric staining with his lifeblood, he realized that the power the car had promised was not without its cost.\n\n\n\nThe following day, Toujo's arm was a patchwork of bandages, a mottled mess of white and red that he tried to hide under his shirt sleeve. The whispers grew more insistent, the rusty car's siren call a constant presence in his mind. He was a man caught between two worlds, neither fully flesh nor fully steel. The itch had become a constant companion, a maddening reminder of his new reality. His hand trembled as he gripped his hammer, the claws glinting in the sun as he worked, a silent threat to the world that had shaped him into the man he was today.\n\n\n\nThe pain grew with each passing hour, a symphony of agony that crescendoed in his very soul. His work suffered, his mind consumed by the incessant whispering of the metal that now coursed through his veins. His foreman noticed his distraction, the quality of his work slipping, and called him aside once more. \"Toujo, what's going on?\" he asked, his voice tinged with worry. Toujo clenched his fist, the bandages hiding the truth beneath. He couldn't tell him, couldn't risk losing everything.\n\n\n\nFinally, the moment of truth came. Toujo's hand, now fully transformed into a metallic monstrosity, had become too much to bear. The whispers grew louder, a cacophony of steel and despair that drowned out the sounds of the city. In a fit of rage and desperation, he ripped the bandages away, revealing the gleaming claw that had replaced his human hand. His foreman stared in shock, his eyes wide with horror. Without a word, Toujo turned and sprinted towards the nearest building, his legs propelling him upwards with inhuman speed.\n\n\n\nOn the rooftop, the wind whipped through his hair as he stared down at the city below. The steel and glass towers looked like a sea of sharp teeth, ready to devour him whole. The whispers grew louder, urging him to embrace his new form, to let go of his humanity and become one with the metal. And for a brief, terrible moment, he considered it. The pain, the fear, the struggle to provide for his family; it all seemed so trivial compared to the power he could wield as a creature of steel. But then he thought of Yuko's smile, their daughter's laughter, and the warmth of their embrace. He knew he couldn't leave them.\n\n\n\nWith a roar that tore through the quiet night, Toujo flung himself from the edge of the building, the wind rushing past him like a scream. The city lights grew distant, a twinkling mirage as he plummeted towards the unforgiving pavement. His heart hammered in his chest, the claw of the car's curse tightening around his soul. In those final moments, he realized that he had made a choice, to be a man of steel in spirit, not in flesh. He closed his eyes and whispered a prayer, steeling himself for the impact that never came.\n\n\n\nInstead, the world around him grew quiet, the whisper of the wind replaced by a gentle hum. The metal in his arm surged, extending into gleaming wings that unfurled with a metallic shiver. He soared, the cityscape rushing below him, a blur of light and shadow. The pain was gone, replaced by an exhilarating sense of freedom that made his heart sing. He had become something more, something greater than the sum of his parts. He was not a monster, not a machine; he was a guardian, a protector forged in the fires of adversity.\n\n\n\nToujo hovered above the rusty car, his wings casting a shadow over its crumpled form. He knew now that the metal wasn't a curse but a gift, one that could be wielded for good or ill. The choice was his to make. With newfound determination, he turned towards home, the wind in his face a promise of the battles to come. He would fight for his family, for his city, and for himself, and he would not let the whispers of the past dictate his future. The metal in his arm was a reminder of his struggle, a symbol of his strength, and a testament to the enduring human spirit.\n\n\n\nThe next morning, as the sun painted the city in shades of gold, Toujo stood before his wife and daughter, his metal wing folded neatly at his side. They stared in awe, the fear in their eyes slowly replaced by wonder. He knew he had a responsibility now, to use his newfound power to protect those he loved and to keep the whispers of despair at bay. The world had changed, but his love for them remained unyielding, a beacon of hope in a world of steel and shadow.\n\n\n\nAnd so, with a heart full of resolve, Toujo set forth into the day, the sound of his wing's metallic flutter a testament to his transformation. He had become something more than a construction worker, more than a man. He was a symbol of hope, a beacon in the ever-expanding concrete jungle.\n\n\n\nBut the world had a way of throwing curveballs, and Toujo was about to face the biggest one yet. As he descended from the skies, a sudden pain shot through his head, and the world around him grew dark. He awoke to the cold, sterile embrace of a mental hospital bed, the echoes of his own screams still lingering in the air. A doctor with a kind but weary face hovered over him, his eyes filled with concern. The doctor spoke softly, but the words were like nails on a chalkboard, shattering the illusion of Toujo's new reality.\n\n\n\n\"Mr. Toujo, I'm afraid your condition has taken a turn for the worse. The stress, the long hours, the accident... it's all become too much for your mind to handle.\" The doctor paused, his gaze drifting to a clipboard that held Toujo's fate in its neatly scribbled notes. \"The construction site... your new... abilities... it was all a delusion, a way for your mind to cope with your injury.\"\n\n\n\nThe room grew colder, the steel wing that had been a part of him just moments ago now a figment of his imagination. The doctor continued, his voice a monotone that droned through Toujo's shattered world. \"You've been with us for some time now, and while we've made progress, the infection from the cut has affected your cognitive abilities. I'm sorry, but the construction work... the flying... it was all in your head.\"\n\n\n\nThe weight of reality crushed down on Toujo, his heart a leaden stone in his chest. He looked around the small room, the walls closing in, the smell of antiseptic a stark contrast to the diesel and dust of the construction site. The doctor was speaking, but his words were lost in the cacophony of Toujo's own thoughts, a maelstrom of doubt and despair. Had it all been a lie? His mind reeled, trying to grasp onto the threads of truth in a tapestry of madness.\n\n\n\nThe doctor's voice grew more insistent, but Toujo barely heard him over the screaming in his head. The whispers of the rusty car, the power, the freedom - all of it had been a mirage, a desperate attempt by his fractured psyche to escape the pain of his failing body. The doctor's eyes widened in horror, and Toujo followed his gaze to see his hand, the metal claw that had brought him such strength now a grotesque twist of his own mind's making, digging into the doctor's throat.\n\n\n\nThe world around him grew dark once more, the doctor's lifeless eyes staring back at him, a silent accusation. Had he done this? Was he capable of such violence? The whispers grew louder, the rusty car's siren call beckoning him back into the abyss. But as the darkness closed in, Toujo found a spark of light, a memory of his family's love, a love that transcended the boundaries of his own mind. With a roar of defiance, he ripped the metal from his flesh, tearing himself free from the delusion that had consumed him.\n\n\n\nThe room was quiet now, the doctor's body a grim reminder of the path he had almost taken. The whispers were gone, the power a mirage that had led him to the brink of madness. Toujo wept, the pain of his loss a physical ache that resonated through his being. But amidst the sorrow, a new resolve grew, a determination to face the world with the strength that had always been within him. The construction site, the cranes, the steel beams - they were his reality, and he would fight to return to them, to his true calling.\n\n\n\nWith trembling hands, he reached for the phone, his mind racing to piece together a plan. He had to escape this place, to get back to his job, to his life. The doctor's keys jingled in his hand, a symbol of the freedom he had lost and the power he had once believed himself to have. The hospital's fluorescent lights flickered overhead, casting an eerie glow on the blood-stained floor. The metal was gone, but the scars remained, a stark reminder of the battle he had waged within himself.\n\n\n\n"},"15":{"title":"The smiling man on Channel 7","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1jndz61\/the_smiling_man_on_channel_7\/","flair":"Story","author":"East_Plankton_2991","selftext":"\n\nHave you ever heard of the smiling man on Channel 7? That\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t exist\u2014or at least, he shouldn\u2019t.\n\nIt all started one night when I couldn\u2019t sleep. I heard a knocking sound. I got out of bed, stepped out of my room, and into the hallway. Just as I entered the hall, the knocking stopped. I thought someone had knocked on the front door, so I went to open it, but no one was there. I closed the door and didn\u2019t think much of it.\n\nNow that I was already up, there was no point in going back to bed and trying to sleep; it was already 3 AM. I turned on the TV, looking for something to watch. When I got to Channel 7, I wondered what was being aired.\n\nOn the screen, there was a black room with a single ceiling lamp, and in the middle of the room stood a man. His eyes were wide open, and he had a large grin on his face. There was nothing else\u2014just a man standing in the middle of a black room, smiling and staring directly into the camera.\n\nI just sat there on the couch, staring, wondering what the hell I was watching. After what felt like an eternity, I turned off the TV and went back to bed.\n\nThe next day at work, I kept thinking about what I had seen. Why would Channel 7 broadcast something so strange in the middle of the night? I had trouble concentrating at work, my mind stuck on the events of the night before.\n\nWhen I got home, I decided to check Channel 7 again to see if the man was still there. But when I switched to the channel, the man was gone, and something else was airing instead. Later that night, I checked again, but still, no man.\n\nI woke up to a sound\u2014knocking. I looked at the clock. 3 AM. I got out of bed to investigate where it was coming from. The knocking seemed to be coming from the living room.\n\nWhen I entered the living room, I listened carefully to pinpoint the source. The knocking was coming from the TV. The sound was coming from inside the screen.\n\nI just stood there, staring at it.\n\nSuddenly, my phone chimed. A message.\n\nIt was from a number I didn\u2019t recognize. Hesitantly, I opened the message.\n\nOn the screen was a picture of me\u2014taken from the front. It was as if someone had been standing right in front of me, taking a photo.\n\nIt was as if the picture had come from the TV.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t just a picture. There was a message, too.\n\n**Watch Channel 7.**"},"16":{"title":"The crucifixion of Jesus?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1jnfipe\/the_crucifixion_of_jesus\/","flair":"Story","author":"StoryLord444","selftext":"We work for a company\u2014a secret government facility\u2014called Braxis. For years, we\u2019ve pushed the limits of time travel, bending the laws of physics to our will. But one thing we\u2019ve never done is crack the code to travel further back\u2014farther than a few hundred years.\n\nThat changes today.\n\nDr. Adrian Voss stands over the console, hands hovering over the controls, his breath shallow. The room is tense, the glow of the reactor casting sharp shadows against the steel walls.\n\n\u201cThis is it,\u201d he mutters. \u201cThis is where we break history.\u201d\n\nI glance at the others. Dr. Langley double-checks the calculations on his tablet, jaw clenched. Ramirez wipes the sweat from his brow. Agent Calloway, always composed, just watches.\n\nAdrian\u2019s finger hovers over the activation switch. A single press, and we go where no one has ever gone.\n\nFurther back.\n\nTo the very moment that could change everything.\n\nThe crucifixion of Jesus Christ.\n\nThat\u2019s where we were going.\n\nThe machine\u2014the Chrono Rift\u2014was a monstrosity of steel and circuitry, a coffin-shaped chamber built for three. Its surface pulsed with streaks of blue energy, the reinforced glass of the entry hatch trembling as the core spun beneath it. Cables snaked across the floor, feeding into a reactor that thrummed like a living thing. Inside, three harnessed seats faced a curved control panel lined with flickering displays, biometric scanners, and a failsafe switch we prayed we\u2019d never need.\n\nI was going in. Along with Adrian Voss and Dr. Elaine Carter.\n\nAdrian was the lead physicist, the genius who had spent the last decade tearing apart the laws of time. He was sharp, meticulous, but there was something in his eyes\u2014an obsession that made me uneasy.\n\nElaine was our historical analyst, chosen for her extensive knowledge of ancient civilizations and religious texts. Unlike Adrian, she was cautious, always second-guessing, always grounding us in reality.\n\nAnd me? I was the observer. The one sent to record history firsthand. The one who would see the truth with my own eyes.\n\nI gripped the harness straps as Adrian powered up the Rift. The chamber vibrated, the walls groaning under the pressure of forces we barely understood. A deep hum filled the air, a sound that wasn\u2019t just noise but something deeper\u2014something that rattled the bones.\n\n\u201cLast chance to back out,\u201d Adrian said, his fingers tightening over the activation panel.\n\nElaine shot me a look, her face pale. I could see the doubt there, the unspoken question: Should we be doing this?\n\nI swallowed hard. \u201cDo it.\u201d\n\nAdrian pressed the switch.\n\nThe world fractured.\n\nThe machine spoke, its synthesized voice cold and emotionless.\n\n\u201cDestination confirmed: April 3rd, 33 AD. Jerusalem. Preparing for temporal displacement.\u201d\n\nThe year scientists believed to be the most probable date of the crucifixion. The moment everything changed.\n\nThe reactor roared beneath us, the air inside the Chrono Rift growing thick, charged with something beyond electricity. The reinforced glass flickered between reality and something else\u2014something raw and unfinished.\n\nElaine gripped the armrests, her knuckles white. Adrian\u2019s breathing was steady, but I could see the tension in his jaw.\n\n\u201cInitiating time breach in three\u2026 two\u2026 one.\u201d\n\nThe world shattered.\n\nThe machine groaned, its steel frame shuddering violently. I felt my body jerk in every direction, like a ragdoll caught in a storm. The walls of the chamber blurred, twisting and rippling, as though the fabric of space itself was coming undone. My stomach flipped in a way that made me want to scream, but no sound came\u2014just the disorienting rush of windless pressure pressing against my chest.\n\nI couldn\u2019t tell which way was up. The lights in the Rift flickered, sputtered, then blinked out completely. All I could hear was the thundering pulse of the reactor beneath us, a heartbeat louder than my own. My hands gripped the armrests, knuckles white, but I could feel the air around me tearing apart. Time, reality\u2014everything was falling, spinning, stretching.\n\nAnd then\u2014\n\nA sudden, brutal stillness.\n\nIt was like being slammed against an invisible wall, but instead of pain, there was only the suffocating quiet that followed. The violent shaking stopped as abruptly as it had started. For a second, I couldn\u2019t move. Everything felt like it had frozen in place, but the sensation was too intense, too alien for me to comprehend.\n\nI blinked rapidly, trying to make sense of what had happened. My head spun, my body heavy and unresponsive. When I lifted my hand to adjust my jacket, I froze.\n\nThe fabric. The stitching. It was all wrong.\n\nI wore a plain black hoodie, faded jeans, and sneakers that felt out of place against the coarse air. Adrian had on his usual, a black t-shirt with a faded logo, cargo pants, and boots that looked too modern to belong here. Elaine\u2019s jacket, sleek and tight, seemed to mock the time we\u2019d just stepped into.\n\nWe didn\u2019t belong.\n\nThe air had a dry, biting heat to it. I could taste dust in the back of my throat as the wind kicked up around us, the ground beneath our feet a hard, uneven surface of cracked earth and jagged stones.\n\nAhead of us, sprawled in the distance, was a city\u2014the city. Jerusalem, as we\u2019d been told.\n\nBut it was no modern city, no towering buildings or glistening glass structures. The walls were jagged and sun-bleached, rising from the dust like an ancient ruin. Stone towers stood tall, their surfaces eroded by time and the endless harsh winds. From here, I could see the squat, flat-roofed buildings crowding the streets, packed so closely together that they looked like a maze of stone, winding and labyrinthine.\n\nThe streets between the buildings were narrow, choked with dust and littered with dried hay and refuse. The people moved in slow, deliberate steps, their feet shuffling over the ground in sandals that seemed to be molded directly to the earth beneath them. The women wore simple tunics, their heads covered by scarves, while the men wore plain robes, their faces weathered by the relentless sun.\n\nA distant bell tolled somewhere in the city, a low, mournful sound that echoed through the still air. The sun hung high, unforgiving, casting long shadows across the cracked streets, and yet the city seemed alive with the buzz of everyday life\u2014unhurried, patient, as if the world had never changed.\n\nAnd still, we didn\u2019t belong.\n\nWe were standing in a place that was centuries behind us, our clothes an insult to the world around us. The city was ancient, its stones weathered, yet everything inside it felt as if it had been frozen in time. It was as if we had stepped into the past\u2014but not just any past. A past that was sacred, a past that would soon witness something that would shake the very foundations of faith itself.\n\nAnd that was why we had come. But now that we were here, the weight of it\u2014the wrongness of being here\u2014settled into the pit of my stomach.\n\nWe began the long walk down toward the city. Miles stretched between us and the walls of Jerusalem, but the heat, the oppressive air, made every step feel longer. The ground beneath our feet was cracked and dry, the dirt swirling with dust as we moved. Every so often, I caught a glimpse of our reflection in the darkened windows of makeshift homes\u2014our modern clothes, so out of place, stood stark against the earth-toned simplicity of the world around us. The others\u2014Adrian, Elaine, and I\u2014we were like ghosts in a world that had no need for us.\n\nAs we neared the outskirts, it didn\u2019t take long for the first eyes to fall on us. They were cautious glances at first, quick flicks of the gaze, but then they lingered. People stopped their work, paused in their tracks, staring at us as we walked past.\n\nA child tugged at his mother\u2019s robe, whispering something I couldn\u2019t catch. She glanced at us and quickly pulled him close, her brow furrowing as if she feared something might infect him just by looking at us.\n\nA man adjusting a wooden cart turned slowly, eyes widening as he took us in, his lips curling into a mix of confusion and concern. He muttered something to a companion who stood nearby, and before long, the whispers began\u2014quiet at first, but growing louder, rippling through the street like a wave.\n\nElaine, ever the cautious one, pulled her jacket tighter around her, trying to shrink into herself, as though somehow she could become invisible. Adrian\u2019s eyes flicked over the people, but he didn\u2019t flinch. If anything, he stood a little taller, like the attention didn\u2019t faze him.\n\nBut me? I felt every eye. Every glance that seemed to pierce through my skin, past the modern fabric and straight into something they couldn't understand. It was like we were a spectacle, something they had never seen before, and they didn\u2019t know whether to fear us or marvel at us.\n\nA woman with a basket of fruit stood just ahead, her face wrinkled with age. She squinted at us, her gaze lingering on the smooth, synthetic material of our clothes, then down at our shoes, her lips parting in disbelief. The strange, foreign look on her face was clear: What are you?\n\nI could feel the weight of it all\u2014this unnatural feeling that clung to us. I felt like a freak show, something designed for their amazement, their confusion.\n\nAnother man, this one older with a beard streaked with gray, walked up to us, cautious but intrigued. \u201cYou\u2014where are you from?\u201d His voice was rough, the words foreign and halting, but it was the question we feared.\n\nAdrian didn\u2019t answer at first, his lips pressed into a thin line. Elaine spoke before he could, her voice quiet but firm. \u201cWe\u2026 we\u2019re travelers,\u201d she said.\n\nThe man didn\u2019t seem satisfied, his brows knitting together. He looked us up and down again, scanning our clothes, the slickness of the fabric that didn\u2019t belong to this time. \u201cTravelers,\u201d he repeated, as if tasting the word, trying to decide if it made sense.\n\nA murmur rippled through the crowd.\n\nAs we walked deeper into the city, more eyes followed us. A group of children stopped playing with stones, their bare feet frozen against the dirt as they stared. A man in a robe paused by a door, leaning out to take in the strange figures who had dared to walk through his world.\n\nThey didn\u2019t know what to make of us. And neither did I.\n\nWe didn\u2019t belong here. And the longer we stayed, the clearer it became.\n\nThe bell rang\u2014loud and ominous, echoing through the streets with a sharp, resonant clang. It was a heavy sound, one that made the air itself seem to still, as if the world was bracing for something. People stopped what they were doing, their eyes rising toward the sound, then quickly lowering as they began to move, almost instinctively.\n\nIt was like a signal. A command.\n\nWe didn\u2019t know why, but something pulled us forward. The crowd\u2014quiet, solemn, but united\u2014began to flow like a river, all of them heading in the same direction. People shuffled along, their bare feet moving quickly through the dust, their heads bowed. A few whispers passed, but no one spoke above a murmur.\n\nI glanced at Adrian, then Elaine, both of them already walking along with the crowd, their expressions unreadable, as if this had become their path too. I had no choice but to follow, and so I did, my feet moving of their own accord.\n\nThe streets became narrower as we pushed past the buildings. The sounds of the city faded into the distance, replaced by the soft shuffle of sandals on dirt and the occasional gasp from the crowd. We were leaving the city, heading toward the outskirts, toward the far reaches of the land. The dust grew thicker, the air heavier, as if the weight of the moment was pressing down on us with every step.\n\nAnd then, as we crested a small hill, I saw them.\n\nA group of Roman soldiers\u2014strong men, their armor shining despite the dust, their faces hard and indifferent\u2014lined the road ahead. They moved with purpose, but not with haste. In their midst, dragging a heavy wooden cross, was a man.\n\nAt first, I didn\u2019t recognize him. His body was bent, as if the weight of the cross was too much for him to bear. His head hung low, his hair matted with sweat, his skin bloodied and torn from lashes. His legs trembled with each step, but still, he pulled the cross behind him, the splintering wood scraping the ground with each agonizing drag.\n\nThe soldiers, their faces cold and unfeeling, followed behind him, cracking whips at his back, at his legs, at the ground around him. Every crack of the whip was like a shout, a vicious command that he was to keep moving. The sound of the leather against his skin made my stomach turn.\n\nHe stumbled, collapsing to the ground beneath the weight of the cross. But before he could even catch his breath, the soldiers yanked him up by the arms, their grip cruel. One of them kicked the cross, forcing him to rise and continue dragging it forward, the blood from his wounds staining the earth beneath him.\n\nI could feel the heat rising from the land, from the crowd that had followed like obedient sheep. We had come here, to this desolate stretch of earth, to witness this moment\u2014this brutal, painful moment.\n\nThe man was no longer just a figure in a book or a story I had heard since childhood. He was real. Flesh and bone. His suffering was not just a tale passed down through time\u2014it was here, in front of me, raw and terrifying.\n\nThe crowd pressed in closer, the tension thickening as we all watched the procession. The sky was dimming, as if the heavens themselves were waiting, holding their breath for what was to come.\n\nAnd I realized, as I stood there, frozen in place with the rest of them, that we weren\u2019t just witnesses to history. We were intruders in something that had no place for us. This was a moment\u2014the moment\u2014that we had no right to observe, no right to interfere with.\n\nBut we had come, and now there was no turning back.\n\nThe hill was barren, a desolate patch of land that had been worn down by countless souls who had passed before, the dry earth cracked and split beneath the weight of history. There, two wooden crosses stood against the sky, looming like dark sentinels waiting for their prey. One was in place, standing tall and ready for its condemned. The other, the one meant for the man in the middle, lay on the ground\u2014waiting to be hoisted.\n\nThe soldiers, no longer just keeping pace but urging their prisoner forward, marched him to the hill. His steps were slow, almost dragging, like the very weight of his fate had already broken him. His shoulders hunched beneath the immense burden of the cross, his back a mess of raw, bleeding gashes from the lashes he had received. He stumbled as he walked, his body trembling with exhaustion, but the soldiers\u2019 harsh words and whips drove him onward.\n\nAnd then, the moment came. He collapsed.\n\nThe heavy cross slipped from his shoulder and hit the ground with a dull thud. He crumpled beneath it, his knees giving way. His breath was ragged, his chest heaving for air. The crowd shifted, murmuring in uneasy whispers. I could feel the tension in the air, thick like fog.\n\nSuddenly, Adrian's voice cut through my thoughts, his hand grasping my arm, pulling me back.\n\n\"Don't do it,\" he warned, his voice tight with fear. \"We can\u2019t. We shouldn\u2019t.\"\n\nElaine, too, looked at me with wide eyes, panic flickering in her gaze. \"This isn\u2019t our place. This is history. You can't change it. You\u2014\"\n\nBut the words felt distant, swallowed by the sheer weight of what I was seeing. The man, the one who was about to be executed, lay there on the ground, his breath shallow and desperate, as the soldiers prodded him with their sharp spears. They moved like shadows, indifferent to his suffering. The cruelty of it all made my stomach churn, but something deep within me stirred. I couldn\u2019t just stand by.\n\nIgnoring their protests, my feet moved before I could even think to stop them. My hands trembled as I knelt beside the fallen man, the sight of his battered body striking me to my core. The rough wood of the cross was heavy in my hands, but I lifted it, gritting my teeth against the weight, trying to steady myself.\n\n\"Let me help,\" I found myself saying, the words slipping out before I could even process them.\n\nThe soldiers didn\u2019t stop me. They didn\u2019t even seem to notice, caught up in their own cruel task.\n\nTogether, we raised the cross, his bloodied hands brushing against mine. I lifted it with every ounce of strength I had, my heart pounding in my chest as I helped him stand. I caught a glimpse of his face, his eyes locking with mine.\n\nAnd I froze.\n\nHe looked exactly like the pictures.\n\nHis hair\u2014long, dark, and matted with sweat\u2014fell in tangled strands across his forehead. His beard was unkempt, but it didn\u2019t hide the sorrow in his expression, nor the quiet strength that emanated from him. His eyes, those eyes, weren\u2019t just blue. They burned like fire, a fierce intensity that seemed to pierce through me, to see all my fears, my doubts, my sins.\n\nHe didn\u2019t speak. His lips barely parted, but in the silence between us, something passed\u2014something ancient, something that made the world seem insignificant.\n\nAnd then I noticed his feet\u2014bloodied, battered, scraped raw. The soles were cracked, torn, but they seemed to press into the earth with the force of something far greater. Something that belonged to the heavens and the earth all at once. His feet were like diamonds, not in the literal sense, but in the way they seemed to endure the weight of something more than the physical pain. His body was breaking, but there was something in him that refused to bow to it.\n\nA low hum of sorrow and power seemed to emanate from him as he stood there, leaning slightly against the cross. His breath came in short gasps, but his gaze never faltered, never wavered.\n\n\"Are you alright?\" I whispered, though I knew he couldn\u2019t answer.\n\nHis lips parted slightly, and for a moment, it seemed like he might speak. But he didn\u2019t. He only nodded, a slow, painful movement, acknowledging me without words. And somehow, that made it worse.\n\nThe crowd was still watching. We were all watching.\n\nI wasn\u2019t supposed to be here. None of us were. The gravity of the moment hit me like a tidal wave. This was history\u2014the real history. But somehow, with the cross between us, in this moment, we were connected.\n\nAdrian and Elaine stood a few paces away, their eyes wide, helpless. Adrian\u2019s mouth was a thin line, but he didn\u2019t say anything more. It was too late for that.\n\nI glanced back at the hill. The soldiers were already moving, preparing to raise the cross for its final place. And somehow, I knew. I knew this moment was one that couldn't be undone.\n\nAnd so, together\u2014this man, and I, and the cross\u2014we walked. The hill loomed ahead, the sky darkening, the air thick with the weight of what was to come. The soldiers led the way, but it was me, it was us, who carried the weight of this moment forward.\n\nAs we walked closer to the hill, the air seemed to thicken, the weight of the moment growing heavier with every step. The dry, cracked earth beneath our feet suddenly felt different\u2014warmer, almost suffocating. And then, a low rumble, distant at first, broke the heavy silence. It sounded like thunder, but it wasn\u2019t just any thunder. It was deep, rolling through the sky, almost like the earth itself was groaning under the weight of what was about to happen.\n\nI glanced up, squinting against the growing darkness. The sky\u2014once a pale, washed-out blue\u2014was now swirling with clouds, thick and heavy, gathering together in a way that felt unnatural. They churned like a storm had risen from nowhere, blocking out the sun. The heat of the day began to retreat, replaced by an almost unnatural chill, the air turning damp and thick with tension.\n\nElaine\u2019s voice trembled as she muttered, her eyes darting nervously. \"This... this isn\u2019t right.\"\n\nAdrian, always the more rational one, turned his head to look at the sky, his brow furrowing. \"It's just a storm. Probably just a coincidence.\"\n\nBut there was no mistaking it. The clouds weren\u2019t just gathering\u2014they were closing in. They moved in a way that seemed deliberate, as if they had a purpose, as if they were waiting for something. The wind began to whip around us, picking up in intensity, tearing at our clothes. The sound of the approaching storm was deafening, a low, steady roar that seemed to reverberate through my bones.\n\nAnd as we walked, the thunder grew louder, more pronounced, as if it were reacting to every step we took. The rumble of it filled the air, echoing across the hill. It was like the sky itself was warning us. Like it knew what was coming.\n\nJesus, barely able to stand under the weight of the cross, stumbled again, but his eyes never strayed from the hill ahead. Despite everything, despite the pain and the exhaustion, there was something in his gaze\u2014something deep, something unyielding. He was walking to his fate, the storm gathering behind him like an omen, a silent witness to what was about to happen.\n\nAs we neared the summit of the hill, the rumble of the thunder became a constant, the clouds thickening above us, turning darker by the second. The first flash of lightning split the sky with a crack so sharp it rattled my teeth, and I flinched, instinctively pulling back. The earth seemed to tremble beneath our feet, as if it were ready to crack open at any moment.\n\nAnd still, we walked on.\n\nThe soldiers, too, seemed to feel it. They paused, glancing upward with narrowed eyes, but their focus never shifted. They were more concerned with getting Jesus to the top of the hill than the storm. The moment wasn\u2019t about the weather\u2014it was about what was going to happen next.\n\nWe reached the top of the hill, and I couldn't shake the feeling that we were standing at the very edge of something vast and incomprehensible. A violent wind howled around us, pulling at our clothes and hair, but still, Jesus kept his gaze fixed ahead, as if the storm were no more than a distant hum. The soldiers began their grim task, positioning the cross, their hands quick and mechanical, almost like they had done it countless times before.\n\nThe storm seemed to reach its peak just as they began to raise the cross, the wind whipping furiously around us. A flash of lightning tore through the sky again, and the sound of the thunder was deafening. It felt like the heavens themselves were screaming.\n\nI couldn\u2019t look away. I couldn\u2019t tear my eyes from Jesus. His body was stretched, nailed to the cross, and as the soldiers lifted it, his head bowed, the weight of the world pulling him down. The clouds swirled above us in a violent frenzy, the thunder now an unrelenting roar, echoing through the valley. The earth seemed to groan beneath us, and for a moment, it felt like everything around us had gone silent, like time itself was holding its breath.\n\nThen, as if on cue, the sky shattered.\n\nThe thunder crashed, and the storm seemed to unleash in full force, the clouds turning a deep, bruised purple, swirling in a chaotic, unnatural dance. The first raindrops fell\u2014cold and heavy\u2014and they landed on my skin like ice. The storm didn\u2019t just feel like a storm. It felt like a warning. Something was happening, something was unfolding that I couldn\u2019t fully understand, but I could feel it in the pit of my stomach. The storm wasn\u2019t just a natural occurrence. It felt... personal.\n\nAnd in that moment, standing beneath the weight of history, beneath the raw intensity of the storm, I realized that this wasn\u2019t just a man on a cross. This wasn\u2019t just an execution.\n\nThis was something that would shake the very foundations of the world.\n\nThe hill was barren, empty save for the soldiers, the few onlookers who dared to watch, and us\u2014the strangers from the future. The weight of the moment pressed down on me like an iron vise, suffocating, overwhelming. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest, its rhythm in sync with the sudden stillness in the air.\n\nThey raised the cross, its wooden frame groaning as it creaked against the ropes. And then, the soldiers began their brutal task.\n\nJesus was forced to his knees before the cross, his body trembling. One of the soldiers grabbed his wrist and drove a large iron nail into his hand with a sickening crack. The sound reverberated through the air, and I could taste the iron in my mouth, the foulness of it settling deep in my throat. He screamed.\n\nIt was a scream that tore through the air, raw and unearthly. His body shook with the force of it, but the agony didn\u2019t end. The soldiers moved quickly, nailing his other hand to the wood, and the blood, hot and thick, poured from the wound, dripping down, staining the ground below. Jesus writhed, his chest heaving with each tortured breath, but still, he remained silent through it all\u2014his eyes locked on the sky, as though searching for something, or maybe just waiting.\n\nThey nailed his feet next, stacking them one on top of the other in a strange position. I could see the look of agony on his face as the nail was driven through the flesh, the blood pouring down in streams. The soldiers didn\u2019t care, didn\u2019t pause, just kept working mechanically, their hands steady and cold as they secured him to the cross.\n\nAnd then, with a final tug, they hoisted the cross into the air, the rope creaking as it held the weight. The sky seemed to grow heavier, the clouds swirling above us, angry and thick, but still, Jesus hung there, suspended in the air, his body slumped, his chest rising and falling with each agonizing breath.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when he spoke.\n\n\"I am Satan.\"\n\nThe words broke through the air like a thunderclap. A chill ran down my spine, and I swear, the wind itself seemed to stop for a moment. The world seemed to hold its breath. The soldiers stiffened, their expressions uncertain, but no one dared move. Jesus\u2019s voice was weak, but there was something powerful in the words that followed.\n\n\"I am dying for the sins of humanity,\" he continued, his voice hoarse. \"I am convincing God to spare the world. I may hate all of you, but you mortals have potential. And if God doesn\u2019t want you anymore, then I will have all of you. So I will die for your sins... and your children\u2019s sins.\"\n\nI could hardly breathe. I had no words. The sky felt darker, and the earth beneath us trembled with the weight of what was unfolding. The others\u2014Elaine, Adrian\u2014stood frozen, their faces pale, their eyes wide in disbelief.\n\nJesus\u2019s gaze shifted then, turning to the sky. His lips parted, and with the last remnants of his strength, he spoke again. \"Oh Father... Oh Father, why have you forsaken me?\"\n\nThe wind howled, a mournful cry that carried his words like a prayer, like a plea to the heavens.\n\nHis eyes drifted to the two men beside him, hanging on their own crosses. They, too, were in pain, but the difference in their suffering was stark. Jesus, though wracked with agony, still held a strange kind of peace in his eyes, a calmness that seemed to radiate from his very being.\n\nHis words then fell upon them. \"Worry not. I will protect you. You\u2019re coming with me to a new Heaven, a better Heaven.\"\n\nI didn\u2019t know what to say, how to react. Every fiber of my being felt frozen, locked in a moment I couldn\u2019t fully comprehend. The sky above us was thick with clouds, and I could feel the weight of what he had said, the intensity of the storm, the crackle in the air. There was something ancient in his eyes, something eternal, and for the briefest of moments, I could almost hear the rumbles of the earth beneath us, responding to his words.\n\nThe rain began to fall again\u2014heavy, cold drops hitting the earth like the world itself was weeping.\n\nI didn\u2019t know if I believed him. I didn\u2019t know what any of this meant. But as Jesus\u2019s body hung there, bloodied and broken, I couldn\u2019t help but feel the gravity of it, the weight of what he had said, and for the first time, I wondered if we, the ones who had come to see it all, were the ones who had truly misjudged everything.\n\nThe storm raged on above us, and the sky cracked with lightning, but the words Jesus spoke lingered in my mind like an echo that would never fade.\n\n\"Worry not. I will protect you all.\"\n\nI step forward, my heart racing in my chest, my mind a mess of confusion. My hand trembles as I reach out, pressing it against the rough, splintered wood of the cross. The pain radiating from Jesus's broken body, the agony hanging heavy in the air\u2014it all feels suffocating, like the world itself is holding its breath. The storm rages above, the wind whipping through the air, and I can't take my eyes off the figure on the cross.\n\nI swallow, my throat dry, and finally, I speak. My voice cracks, thick with emotion. \"Are you really the devil? Is this why they crucified you? What are you really? How are you Satan but not Jesus? I'm confused. Please... answer me. Do not go yet. I still have questions.\"\n\nThe world goes silent, save for the soft, steady rhythm of the rain, like time itself is holding its breath. Then, from the cross, I see it\u2014a faint smile. It's not a smile of joy, but of something else. A strange, knowing smile, tinged with sadness and understanding. Like this was all inevitable.\n\n\"I am Satan,\" the figure on the cross says, his voice barely a whisper, but it carries a weight that presses down on me like the storm above us. \"I am able to shapeshift into many beings. I am many things. I am a dragon, a snake... I am Jesus. I am even God. I am what I want to be, and what I prefer humanity to see me as.\"\n\nThe words hit me like a blow, sinking deep into my chest, leaving me paralyzed. Everything I thought I knew about Jesus, about Satan, about God\u2014everything feels shattered in that moment. The figure on the cross, his body bloodied and broken, still carries a strange calmness in his eyes. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s at peace, despite the excruciating pain he\u2019s enduring. The storm rages, but all I can focus on is his words\u2014words that seem to bend the very fabric of reality itself.\n\nMy mind struggles to comprehend it all, the weight of it pressing down on me. My thoughts scatter, trying to make sense of what I just heard. I open my mouth, but the words come out shaky, uncertain. \"You are everything... and nothing. What does that mean? How can you be all of them? How can you be both Satan and Jesus?\"\n\nThe figure on the cross just watches me, his gaze piercing through me like he can see every question, every ounce of confusion in my soul. But he doesn\u2019t answer. Not in this moment. Not with words. His silence... it says everything. It says the answer may never come, not in this world, not in this time.\n\nThe storm rages on, its fury intensifying as the rain pelts down harder and harder, drenching us all. The wind howls, and I feel the weight of it\u2014the weight of everything that just happened. I stand there, my hand still pressed against the cross, trying to understand, trying to make sense of what I've just witnessed.\n\nElaine and Adrian approach, their footsteps muffled by the storm. One of them places a hand on my shoulder, a gesture of comfort, of understanding. They feel it too\u2014the confusion, the disbelief, the weight of the truth we just learned. It\u2019s too much, too overwhelming, but somehow, we\u2019re not alone in it. They feel the same, and for a moment, there\u2019s solace in that.\n\nI swallow hard, my voice shaky as I ask one last question. \"Satan... one last question. Where is Jesus? If you aren\u2019t him... is there even a real Jesus? Was there ever a Jesus?\"\n\nSatan, his body broken and bloodied, looks down at me with that same strange, knowing smile. It's the kind of smile that sends a chill down your spine. His words come slowly, carefully, like he\u2019s been waiting for this moment, waiting for me to ask.\n\n\"There is no Jesus,\" he says softly, his voice cold and calm. \"It's always just been me. I made it all up\u2014the birth, the star in the sky... it\u2019s all on me. You know, when my Father gave me the Earth, he wasn\u2019t kidding. This Earth is mine, and I make it in my image. God may have made you humans in His image, but I have reshaped you all in ours.\"\n\nThe last sentence strikes me like a bolt of lightning, like the truth of the world itself being laid bare in a single, terrifying declaration. And then, just like that, he dies. The body on the cross slumps, lifeless, the last breath leaving him in an eerie silence.\n\nAs if in response, the heavens break open. Lightning strikes the ground with a deafening crack of thunder, and the rain pours down in torrents. The wind whips around us with a strength I\u2019ve never felt before, as if the world itself is mourning the death of something much bigger than just a man on a cross. And yet, despite the storm, there is something unsettlingly still about the moment. It\u2019s as if time itself is caught between the past and the future, unsure of where it belongs.\n\nWe stand there for a while, not knowing what to do, not knowing what to say. Some people\u2014those who had been watching\u2014turn away, indifferent. After all, he had claimed to be the devil. They don\u2019t care much about his death. But for others, like his mother, the loss is overwhelming. She cries, her sobs loud in the storm, a mother mourning her child\u2014a child who had said things that shook the very foundations of the world.\n\nI understand now. That\u2019s why we weren\u2019t taught this part of history. Some things are just meant to be left in the dark. The truth, in all its rawness, is too much to bear. Too dangerous.\n\nWe begin to walk away from the cross, the storm still raging around us. Our steps are heavy, burdened with the knowledge we carry, with the truth we now know. We make our way toward the coffin-like machines, the ones that will take us back to our time, back to our reality. The wind howls, the rain beats against us, but we don\u2019t stop. We can\u2019t stop.\n\nAs we enter the machines, I take one last look at the storm outside. The world seems different now\u2014changed, as if the very fabric of history has been ripped apart, revealing the truth beneath. And as the machines hum to life, taking us back to where we came from, the weight of it all settles in.\n\nI know the truth now. The truth about the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.\n\nAnd it's all built on lies.\n\n"},"17":{"title":"You\u2019re Sitting on the Bus","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1jnebm6\/youre_sitting_on_the_bus\/","flair":"Story","author":"East_Plankton_2991","selftext":"You\u2019re standing at the bus station, waiting for the bus.

People ask me, \u201cWhy would I make such a choice to be part of such an experiment?\u201d Well, the clear answer is this: when my wife and my son died in a car crash on a freeway, I became depressed and mentally unstable. Why not be part of such an experiment to prove that there\u2019s an afterlife? That my wife and my son are somewhere in this universe.\n\nHere\u2019s my story of what I experienced in the death experiment.\n\nI was sitting on my couch, watching TV, when suddenly there was a knock at my door. I looked through the peephole, and I saw two strange men standing outside, dressed in black suits with ties, holding a briefcase.\n\nOut of curiosity, I opened the door. One of the men asked me a strange question: \u201cWould you like to be part of an experiment called the Death Experiment?\u201d\n\nA flood of thoughts crashed through my mind, each one louder than the last. Was this some kind of joke? Were they serious? The Death Experiment? The words echoed inside my head. What kind of experiment was that? What did they mean by death?\n\nBut then, I thought about my wife. My son. The violent wreck on the freeway. The empty spaces they left behind. What if this was it? What if this was the answer I had been searching for? Why question it when the name said it all? The Death Experiment.\n\nI exhaled sharply, my fingers twitching at my sides. \u201cHow do I sign up? Where do I join?\u201d I asked.\n\nThe man with the briefcase gave a slight nod, his expression unreadable. \u201cIf you come with us now, you can join immediately.\u201d\n\nThey turned, walking toward a sleek black car parked along the curb, the tinted windows swallowing any reflection of the streetlights above. My body moved on its own, my pulse hammering as I stepped outside, closing the door behind me.\n\nI slid into the backseat, buckled in, and felt the cold leather press against my back. The driver pulled away smoothly, the hum of the engine filling the silence. The city streets blurred past in streaks of neon and shadow, but soon, we veered away from the familiar. The roads became darker, more isolated. The farther we drove, the more I realized\u2014we weren\u2019t heading anywhere ordinary.\n\nThen, I saw it.\n\nA massive, polished-white facility loomed ahead, a monolith against the night sky. It was impossibly large\u2014both wide and tall, stretching out like a fortress. The exterior gleamed under the harsh floodlights mounted along its perimeter, giving it an almost sterile glow. But something about it felt wrong.\n\nArmed guards stood like statues at the front gates, their faces hidden beneath dark visors. Their rifles were held firmly across their chests, fingers resting near the triggers. Surveillance cameras dotted every corner, their red lights blinking in slow, measured intervals.\n\nAs we approached, the heavy metal gates groaned open, sliding apart with mechanical precision. The car pulled through, gliding down a long, straight path leading to the facility\u2019s main entrance\u2014two towering doors made of reinforced steel, their smooth surfaces unmarked by any signage.\n\nThe moment we stopped, one of the men stepped out and opened my door. \u201cFollow me.\u201d\n\nI obeyed, stepping onto the pavement. The air was cold, laced with the faint smell of antiseptic and something metallic. I walked with them toward the entrance, my shoes tapping against the pristine concrete. As we reached the doors, a small red scanner flickered to life, reading the man\u2019s face. A quiet beep followed, and the heavy doors unlocked with a deep, mechanical thunk.\n\nInside, the facility was eerily silent. The walls were a sterile white, the floors polished to a mirror-like shine. The ceiling stretched high above, lined with long, fluorescent lights that buzzed softly. As we walked further, I noticed reinforced doors on either side of the hallway, each labeled only with numbers. No names. No descriptions.\n\nAt the end of the corridor was a reception desk, manned by another figure in a black suit. The woman behind the desk barely looked up as the man beside me handed over a thin folder. A few quick stamps, a quiet murmur between them, and then she gestured toward another door.\n\n\u201cProceed,\u201d she said flatly.\n\nWe moved through, stepping into what looked like a waiting area. The furniture was minimalist, the air too still. Before I could process it all, a door on the other side swung open.\n\nA man in a white lab coat entered. He was tall, thin, with sharp features and a gaze that seemed to look through me rather than at me. He carried a clipboard, his fingers drumming lightly against its surface.\n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re the patient,\u201d he said, his voice smooth but clinical.\n\nI met his stare. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you\u2019re calling me.\u201d\n\nHe gave a thin smile. \u201cWelcome to NEXUS.\u201d\n\nThe name sent a chill through me.\n\n\u201cNEXUS?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat even is this place?\u201d\n\nThe doctor adjusted his glasses, tapping his pen against his clipboard.\n\n\u201cNEXUS\u2014The Neurological Experimentation and Xenogenesis Understanding Syndicate.\u201d His eyes gleamed under the sterile light. \u201cA government-funded facility dedicated to one thing: exploring what lies beyond the threshold of death.\u201d\n\nHis words hung in the air, heavy and absolute.\n\nAnd in that moment, I realized\u2014I had truly stepped into something I couldn\u2019t escape.\n\nThe man in the black suit stepped forward, setting the briefcase on a nearby metal table with a dull clank. The doctor took it without a word, his fingers ghosting over the latches before flipping them open with two sharp clicks.\n\nA stack of neatly bound bills filled the interior\u2014row after row of crisp, unmarked hundred-dollar bills. The sight of it made my stomach twist.\n\nCuriosity gnawed at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s in that briefcase, anyway?\u201d I asked, my voice steady despite the unease creeping up my spine. \u201cThe one they showed up with at my doorstep?\u201d\n\nThe doctor didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cMoney,\u201d he said plainly.\n\nI frowned. \u201cHow much?\u201d\n\nHe glanced at me, adjusting his glasses. \u201cFifty million.\u201d\n\nI blinked. \u201cFifty million dollars?\u201d\n\nHe nodded as if it were nothing. \u201cAnd there\u2019s another briefcase waiting for you. Same amount.\u201d\n\nThe weight of his words settled in my chest. A hundred million dollars. Enough to disappear. Enough to rewrite a life. But there was a catch\u2014there was always a catch.\n\nI exhaled. \u201cWhat\u2019s the catch?\u201d\n\nThe doctor smirked. \u201cYou complete the experiment. You keep your mouth shut.\u201d He snapped the briefcase shut with finality. \u201cThis is top secret. Only a few are selected every few years. You were chosen.\u201d\n\nHis eyes locked onto mine, cold and unreadable.\n\nAnd for the first time since stepping into this facility, I realized\u2014I wasn\u2019t just signing up for an experiment.\n\nI was signing away everything.\n\nThe doctor\u2019s gaze lingered on me for a moment before he straightened his coat and exhaled. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d\n\nI swallowed hard, my throat dry. \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\nHe nodded once. \u201cAll right. Come on.\u201d\n\nHe gestured with a tilt of his head, turning toward the hallway. Without hesitation, I followed. Two armed bodyguards fell into step behind us, their heavy boots echoing against the polished white floor. The corridor stretched long, sterile, and unwelcoming, lined with identical doors on both sides\u2014each one locked, each one hiding something.\n\nWe walked in silence, my pulse a steady drumbeat in my ears. The air smelled faintly of antiseptic and something else\u2014something metallic. The overhead lights flickered once, just enough to make my skin prickle.\n\nA turn. Then another.\n\nWith each step, the walls seemed to press closer, the fluorescent lights casting elongated shadows. Finally, the doctor stopped in front of an unmarked door, pressing his palm against a scanner. A low beep sounded, followed by the soft hiss of the lock disengaging.\n\nThe door swung open.\n\nInside, the room was cold and clinical. A metal table sat in the center, draped with a white sheet. Beside it, hospital equipment hummed quietly\u2014monitors, IV stands, and a heart rate monitor that blinked expectantly. The air carried a sharp, sterile scent, mingling with something unmistakable\u2014anticipation.\n\nI stepped inside, my stomach knotting as the doctor followed, the bodyguards remaining just outside.\n\nThis was it.\n\nNo turning back now.\n\nThe doctor let out a quiet sigh, tapping a finger against his clipboard. \u201cGet on the table.\u201d His tone was sharp, but not unkind\u2014just business.\n\nI hesitated for a moment before finally pushing myself up and onto the cold metal surface. The paper sheet crinkled beneath me as I settled in. The air smelled like antiseptic, sharp and sterile.\n\nThe doctor moved with practiced efficiency, reaching for the helmet resting beside a bank of machines at the front of the room. It was sleek and metallic, wires extending from the sides, feeding into the screens displaying rolling waves of brain activity.\n\n\u201cThis helmet,\u201d he began, adjusting the fit over my head, \u201cwill monitor everything happening in your brain in real time. Every electrical impulse, every reaction as you transition through different states of consciousness.\u201d He secured it snugly, the metal cool against my scalp. \u201cFirst, you\u2019ll experience a near-death state. Your life may flash before your eyes. That\u2019s just your brain processing its own shutdown, a final burst of neural activity before\u2014\u201d He snapped his fingers. \u201cIt starts to fade.\u201d\n\nHe moved quickly, attaching electrodes to my temples, my wrists, my chest. The machines beeped steadily, recording my vitals. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what we\u2019re looking for,\u201d he continued, adjusting a few dials. \u201cWe\u2019re searching for what happens after. When the brain ceases all function. No more activity, no more signals.\u201d He glanced at me, his expression unreadable. \u201cIf something remains\u2014anything\u2014then we\u2019ve found our answer.\u201d\n\nThe hum of the machines grew louder. The wires tugged slightly as he made final adjustments.\n\n\u201cAre you ready?\u201d he asked, standing over me now, fingers hovering over the controls.\n\nI exhaled. My heart pounded.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nThe doctor picked up a syringe filled with a clear liquid, tapping it twice before pressing the needle against the inside of my arm. \u201cThis will slow your heart rate and guide you into a controlled death,\u201d he murmured. The cold sting of the needle pierced my skin, a slow pressure flooding through my veins.\n\nThe machines beeped steadily, then slowed.\n\n\u201cCount down from ten,\u201d the doctor instructed. \u201cOr a higher number, if that helps.\u201d\n\nI swallowed, my tongue heavy. \u201cTen\u2026 nine\u2026 ei\u2014\u201d\n\nMy voice faltered. My limbs felt weightless, my fingers tingling.\n\n\u201cSeven\u2026\u201d My breath shuddered. My heartbeat thudded in my ears, slowing with each beat.\n\n\u201cSix\u2026\u201d The lights above me blurred, the doctor\u2019s face turning into a hazy silhouette.\n\n\u201cFi\u2014\u201d\n\nEverything slipped away.\n\nThe last thing I heard was the prolonged, unbroken beep of the heart monitor.\n\nThen\u2014\n\nNothing.\n\n(Part 2 https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/StoryLord444\/s\/Wx0F4S7KZZ)"},"20":{"title":"Hell And Back","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1jld073\/hell_and_back\/","flair":"Story","author":"StoryLord444","selftext":"The music thumped in my chest, the bass rolling over the sand as people danced around the bonfire.

My best friend, Ryan, clapped me on the back, grinning.\n\n\u201cDude, you gotta get in the water,\u201d he said, eyes glassy from whatever he\u2019d been drinking. \u201cYou\u2019re at a beach party, and you haven\u2019t even touched the ocean.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get in later,\u201d I laughed, shaking my head.\n\n\u201cNah, nah, nah. Now.\u201d He grabbed my wrist and started pulling. A few people nearby noticed and started cheering. \u201cJohnny\u2019s finally getting in!\u201d\n\nI rolled my eyes but let them drag me forward. The cool water lapped at my ankles, then my knees. It felt good after standing near the fire. Ryan kept going, wading in up to his waist, and I followed. The waves were gentle, barely more than a soft push against my legs.\n\n\u201cAlright, alright, I\u2019m in,\u201d I said.\n\nRyan smirked. \u201cNah, not yet.\u201d Then he shoved me.\n\nI lost my footing and fell backward, the shock of cold water rushing over me. I came up sputtering, shaking my head.\n\n\u201cAsshole,\u201d I coughed, but I was laughing.\n\nSomeone else splashed me, and before I knew it, half the party was in the water. The night air filled with shouts and laughter as we wrestled and dunked each other. My heart pounded in my chest, the thrill of it all buzzing in my veins.\n\nThen, someone yelled, \u201cLet\u2019s swim out to the buoy!\u201d\n\nIt was barely visible in the moonlight, bobbing out there like a ghost. I hesitated, but Ryan had already taken off, so I followed. The water felt different the farther we went\u2014deeper, colder. My strokes became harder, my breathing more ragged.\n\nSomething brushed my leg.\n\nI flinched. It was probably seaweed, but my pulse spiked anyway. I kept swimming, but the cold was sinking into my bones now. My muscles ached. I was almost there.\n\nThen my foot cramped.\n\nA sharp, searing pain shot through my calf, locking it up like a vice. I gasped, sucking in a mouthful of saltwater. I tried to kick, to tread water, but the pain was too much. My head dipped under.\n\nI struggled, but the more I fought, the heavier I felt. My arms flailed uselessly. My chest burned.\n\nI went under again.\n\nThe muffled sounds of the party faded. My vision blurred, then darkened.\n\nEverything became quiet.\n\nEverything became still.\n\nThen\u2014nothing.\n\nThe pressure around me intensified, and my mind seemed to splinter, like shards of glass scattering in the dark. The voice was still there, its cold presence pressing against my thoughts, but it was no longer asking questions. It was stating facts.\n\n\"You are dead, Johnny.\"\n\nThe words didn\u2019t hit me like a punch, but more like a cold wave washing over me\u2014relentless, inevitable. The realization seeped into every corner of my awareness, and suddenly, everything that was me seemed to vanish into the black.\n\nI tried to fight, to claw my way back to something\u2014anything\u2014but it felt like my essence was slipping through my fingers like smoke.\n\n\"You\u2019re no longer part of the living world.\"\n\nThe void was infinite now, stretching beyond my comprehension. I couldn\u2019t feel my body, couldn\u2019t feel anything. The life I\u2019d known, the people I\u2019d known\u2014it all felt so distant, so far away. I was nothing now, nothing but the echo of a voice that wasn\u2019t mine.\n\nThen, there was a sudden\u2026 stillness.\n\nThe voice, the dark presence that had plagued me, vanished. And all that was left was the silence. The unbroken, suffocating silence.\n\nI was gone.\n\nTime had no meaning. What felt like forever stretched endlessly, like a dark, yawning pit where nothing could ever escape. I couldn\u2019t remember if I had a body, or even if I was still \"me.\" I just\u2026 was. And then, out of the black void, something began to shift.\n\nA light.\n\nAt first, it was faint\u2014a flicker at the edge of my awareness, soft and distant. But it wasn\u2019t in front of me, it was below, beneath me, pulling at something deep inside. I couldn't say what it was\u2014some fragment of me, some faint instinct, a sense of direction that wasn\u2019t quite mine.\n\nSlowly, like I was drifting in a current, I began to fall toward it. But as I did, the light grew stronger. Brighter. The air, if you could call it air, seemed to thicken with heat.\n\nIt was too warm.\n\nThe brightness burned, a suffocating glow that began to scorch what was left of my thoughts. It wasn\u2019t just light anymore\u2014it was fire. It wrapped around me, searing my nonexistent skin, crackling with intensity.\n\nIt felt like I was falling straight into the heart of a flame, an inferno that wanted to swallow me whole. The more I descended, the hotter it got, the brighter it became.\n\nAnd then, a realization.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a light.\n\nIt was fire.\n\nAnd I was drifting closer to it, closer to a place that didn\u2019t feel like salvation. It felt like damnation. My chest tightened, if such a thing was even possible without a chest. The fire called to me, not with words, but with an overwhelming pull, a promise of something terrifying. Something eternal.\n\nI couldn\u2019t stop myself from falling.\n\nI didn\u2019t know if I should stop.\n\nThe heat, the unbearable brightness, consumed everything as I got closer. I felt like I was being pulled into the very core of hell itself, as if the flames were claiming me, and I had no power to fight back.\n\nThe fire roared beneath me, its heat pressing against whatever was left of my being. The brightness was unbearable now, not warm like the sun, but scorching, consuming\u2014like it was meant to purge me.\n\nThen, from deep within the inferno, a voice emerged.\n\nNot like the first.\n\nThis one was heavier. Ancient. It carried the weight of something beyond human understanding, something final. It didn\u2019t echo\u2014it cut straight through the flames, through the void, through me.\n\n\"You have been weighed in the balance and found wanting.\"\n\nThe words struck with a force beyond sound, beyond meaning. It wasn\u2019t just something I heard\u2014it was something I felt. A judgment that rang through the very core of my existence.\n\nA deep, overwhelming terror seized me. Not fear of pain, or even death\u2014I was already dead. No, this was something worse.\n\nI was being cast away.\n\nThe fire below me flared, rising like a living thing. The heat became unbearable. I could feel it, truly feel it now. It seared into me, branding something deeper than flesh\u2014something eternal.\n\nI tried to resist, but there was nothing to hold onto, nothing to fight against.\n\nI was falling.\n\nFalling into the fire.\n\nFalling into judgment.\n\nThe air itself trembled with the sound of agony. The closer I fell, the louder it became\u2014chilling, ear-piercing screams of countless voices, all wailing in endless torment. It was a sound I had never heard before, but somehow, I knew it.\n\nThe cries of the damned.\n\nTheir suffering clung to the air like smoke, thick and suffocating. It wasn\u2019t just screaming\u2014it was desperation, raw and unending. Their voices twisted together, an endless chorus of misery, each one distinct yet blending into something so overwhelming it made my very soul shudder.\n\nThen, beneath the screams, something else.\n\nLaughter.\n\nLow at first, almost like a whisper, but growing louder, swelling into a chorus of wicked delight. It was inhuman\u2014guttural, distorted, filled with a mockery so profound that it sent waves of dread through me. It wasn\u2019t the laughter of men. No, this was something demonic. Something that found amusement in the suffering of souls like mine.\n\nThe laughter slithered through the air, wrapping around me, taunting, welcoming me.\n\nThe fire below surged higher, the heat unbearable now, blistering against what little was left of me.\n\nI was being pulled down.\n\nInto the screams.\n\nInto the laughter.\n\nInto Hell.\n\nThe fiery light consumed me as I plunged headfirst into its blinding embrace. It burned through the darkness, searing away the last remnants of the void.\n\nAnd then\u2014my body.\n\nIt was forming, piece by piece.\n\nI saw my legs stretching outward, skin knitting itself over muscle and bone. My hands, fingers twitching as they solidified. My chest rose and fell, the familiar ache of lungs filling with air. I was whole again.\n\nBut at what cost?\n\nI wasn\u2019t returning\u2014I was still falling.\n\nBelow me, the fiery pit stretched into eternity, its surface churning like molten rock. It wasn\u2019t fire like I\u2019d known on Earth. This burned with a hunger beyond heat, a torment that felt alive. It reached for me with eager tongues of flame, whispering promises of agony.\n\nI hit the fire.\n\nMy skin ignited instantly, my flesh bubbling, peeling, liquefying as a thousand unseen blades flayed me open. The pain was beyond anything human, beyond nerves or the mind\u2019s ability to comprehend. Every second stretched into eternity, every heartbeat an age of suffering. The fire did not just burn\u2014it consumed, eating into my very essence.\n\nI tried to scream, but the flames swallowed my voice.\n\nI was in Hell.\n\nThe landscape around me was a nightmare made real. Rivers of molten fire snaked through jagged obsidian cliffs, each peak impaling writhing souls that shrieked in ceaseless agony. The sky was a suffocating void of swirling smoke and storm, flashes of blood-red lightning illuminating twisted structures\u2014towers made of bone, archways formed from fused, screaming bodies. The air was thick with sulfur, every breath searing my throat like inhaling shattered glass.\n\nEverywhere, shadows moved\u2014figures hunched, broken, crawling through the ashen wasteland. Some wailed, others laughed, their voices hollow and maddening. Chains clanked in the distance, dragging across unseen horrors. The ground itself trembled beneath me, as though the very pit was alive, hungry for more suffering.\n\nA thousand years passed in a second.\n\nThen, something massive loomed over the inferno.\n\nA hand\u2014clawed, monstrous\u2014shot through the flames and clamped around me. The talons dug into my flesh, though I had none left to tear. I was yanked from the fire, my body reconstructing itself in an instant only to be crushed by the creature\u2019s impossible grip.\n\nThe demon was a nightmare made flesh.\n\nIts body was an abomination of shifting shadows and charred flesh, seared with glowing cracks like veins of molten rock. Its head was a mass of writhing horns, curling and twisting into jagged points, framing a face that barely resembled anything human. Six burning eyes, black pits rimmed with crimson fire, gazed at me with amusement. Its grin stretched too wide, splitting its face like a wound filled with serrated fangs. Its breath was a hot wind of decay, reeking of brimstone and death.\n\nIt laughed\u2014a deep, guttural sound that shook the very air.\n\nI writhed in its grasp, screaming as the searing wounds on my body pulsed with fresh agony. The demon dragged me through the inferno, walking with slow, deliberate steps, savoring every moment of my torment. Then, without warning, it hurled me into a pit\u2014an abyss so black it devoured even the glow of the fire above.\n\nI fell.\n\nThe darkness swallowed me whole.\n\nThere was no ground. No walls. No end.\n\nI plummeted endlessly, screaming, my voice lost in the void. I had no control, no escape. I was lost.\n\n\"Jesus, please save me!\"\n\nThe words tore from my throat, raw, desperate, the last shred of hope I had left.\n\nThen\u2014\n\n\"CLEAR!\"\n\nA shock ripped through my chest.\n\n\"CLEAR!\"\n\nPain exploded inside me, like my body was being slammed back into itself.\n\n\"CLEAR!\"\n\nMy lungs convulsed. A sudden pressure in my stomach, a violent force shoving upward\u2014\n\nI coughed, gagging as water burst from my throat.\n\nThe fire was gone. The darkness was gone.\n\nI was back.\n\nThe world rushed into focus\u2014a blur of colors, shifting shadows, burning lights. My chest hurt, a deep, raw pain that clawed at my ribs. My stomach twisted, heaving saltwater onto the wet sand beneath me. The air was thick and humid, the scent of salt and sweat clinging to my skin. The rhythmic crash of waves roared behind me, the tide lapping against the shore.\n\nVoices\u2014shouting, urgent, panicked.\n\nShapes moved around me, their faces distorted by my blurred vision. The sky above was dark, but streaked with the distant glow of the beach bonfire. A crowd had gathered, their outlines shifting in the flickering light.\n\nSomeone gripped my shoulder\u2014a lifeguard, drenched in seawater, his hands trembling. His voice was shaking as he called my name.\n\nI was alive.\n\nBut as I gasped for breath, as the burning sensation from the fire still lingered in my chest, I knew\u2014\n\nI had been there.\n\nI had felt it.\n\nAnd no matter how much time passed\u2026 I would never forget.\n\n"},"21":{"title":"Five nights at Freddy's 2","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1jjv082\/five_nights_at_freddys_2\/","flair":"Story","author":"StoryLord444","selftext":"\"Freddy Fazbear\u2019s Pizza has officially shut down today after disturbing reports connected to the disappearance of five children and the infamous 'Bite of \u201887.'\n\nA 19-year-old employee, whose identity is being withheld, claimed to have experienced supernatural occurrences while working the night shift.

He reported that the restaurant's animatronic mascots moved on their own after hours.

Bright colors flash across the screen, and it all looks so clean and polished, almost like a theme park rather than a pizza joint. Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and a sleeker, shinier Foxy wave at the camera, their faces locked into wide, friendly grins.\n\nI lean forward, squinting at the screen, still half-distracted by the words. Then, the camera cuts to a stage, and I freeze.\n\nToy Freddy stands at the center of the stage, a fresh coat of plastic gleaming under the spotlights. His brown body looks almost too smooth, like he was just pulled out of a factory mold. His blue eyes are wide and inviting, too perfect. He holds a microphone in his hand, singing with a mechanical cheer that sounds... almost too rehearsed. I can feel a chill crawl down my spine.\n\nTo his left, Toy Bonnie strums a bright red guitar, his blue body nearly glowing under the lights. His oversized buck teeth make him look like a cartoon character come to life, and the way his green eyes shift and glimmer toward the camera is almost unnerving. He bobs his head to the beat, like he's alive.\n\nToy Chica stands on the right, her yellow plastic body shining in the lights. Her pink eyes flicker, blinking in an almost robotic way, her white bib gleaming with that \"Let\u2019s Party!\" slogan that\u2019s been on every Chica for years. She waves one hand, swaying her hips as she sings, but there\u2019s something... wrong. Her smile is too perfect, like it was molded onto her face.\n\nThey finish the jingle with a synchronized bow. Toy Freddy straightens up, his head tilting toward the camera, his voice smooth and oddly friendly.\n\n\"We can't wait to see you at Freddy Fazbear's Mega Pizzaplex! It\u2019s gonna be a real party!\"\n\nThe cheerful music fades, and the voiceover kicks in.\n\n\"Come on down to the grand opening of Freddy Fazbear\u2019s Mega Pizzaplex \u2014 bigger, better, and safer than ever before! State-of-the-art technology, fun for the whole family, and, of course, our beloved animatronic friends, now equipped with the latest security and performance upgrades!\"\n\nIt\u2019s all too shiny. Too perfect. But it\u2019s also tempting.\n\n\"We\u2019re now hiring for overnight security. Flexible hours, competitive pay! Be part of the Fazbear family \u2014 apply today!\"\n\nThe screen fades to black, leaving only the glowing logo: Freddy\u2019s face, brighter than ever. It lingers there a little too long, and I feel my heartbeat pick up a little. Then, the commercial ends.\n\nI sit there on the couch, the remote still in my hand. That old broadcast about the five missing kids and the Bite of '87 flashes through my mind. The boy who claimed the robots moved at night. I\u2019d always written it off as some sick prank or a mental breakdown. But that was before I became a paranormal investigator. Before I spent years chasing after shadows and strange noises that always turned out to be bad pipes or faulty wiring.\n\nI wasn\u2019t in this business to find ghosts. I was in it to prove they didn\u2019t exist.\n\nBut something about this? It\u2019s different.\n\n\"Overnight security,\" I mutter under my breath.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m even considering it. I could use the cash, yeah. But if those animatronics really did move at night like the stories say? I\u2019ll be the one to expose it as a hoax.\n\nI grab my laptop and quickly type in my information.\n\nApplication sent.\n\nLater that evening, as I\u2019m sitting on the couch, my phone rings.\n\nRing, ring, ring, ring.\n\nI pick it up, glancing at the screen. The name on it reads \"Freddy Fazbear\u2019s Mega Pizzaplex.\" I swallow, trying to calm my nerves before answering.\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\n\"Good evening, is this John?\" A professional-sounding voice greets me from the other end.\n\n\"Yeah, this is John.\"\n\n\"Hi John, this is Amanda from Freddy Fazbear\u2019s Mega Pizzaplex. I\u2019m calling regarding your recent application for the overnight security position. Is now a good time to talk?\"\n\n\"Yeah, sure.\"\n\n\"Great! First off, thank you for your interest in joining the Fazbear family. We received your application and would like to schedule an interview. The interview will take place tomorrow at 10 AM. Does that work for you?\"\n\n\"Yeah, that works.\" I\u2019m a bit taken aback by how soon the interview is, but I push it aside. I need this.\n\n\"Perfect. Now, let me give you a brief rundown of the position. As an overnight security guard, your primary responsibilities will be to monitor the premises, ensuring the safety of both our guests and animatronics. You\u2019ll be stationed in the security office, with access to cameras covering the entire Pizzaplex. Your shift will start at 11 PM and end at 7 AM. Is this schedule something you\u2019re comfortable with?\"\n\n\"Yeah, that works,\" I reply, trying to sound confident.\n\n\"Great. You\u2019ll be provided with all the necessary training on how to operate the security systems, but we do expect a high level of responsibility. We\u2019ve had incidents in the past, so we need someone who\u2019s detail-oriented and able to respond quickly. Have you had any experience in a security role or working with surveillance equipment?\"\n\n\"I\u2019ve worked with cameras before, but not much else. I\u2019m pretty good with tech, though.\"\n\n\"Good to know. Now, a few more details. The animatronics are programmed to perform during the day, but at night, they go into a sort of \u2018maintenance mode.\u2019 We need you to regularly check the cameras to make sure there are no malfunctions, especially with our older models. Sometimes they can behave erratically. Do you think you\u2019ll be able to handle that kind of responsibility?\"\n\nI pause, remembering the stories I\u2019d heard about the animatronics. \"Yeah, I\u2019ll be fine.\"\n\n\"Good. Just remember, if you see anything unusual, or if one of the animatronics isn\u2019t operating correctly, you\u2019re to report it immediately. There\u2019s an emergency hotline for that. You\u2019re not authorized to handle any repairs yourself.\"\n\n\"Understood.\"\n\n\"We also ask that you sign a nondisclosure agreement. We maintain confidentiality on all activities at the Pizzaplex. It\u2019s part of maintaining a safe environment for everyone, and it\u2019s important that you follow our policies to the letter.\"\n\n\"Got it,\" I reply.\n\n\"Perfect. Based on your application and our conversation today, we\u2019re happy to move forward with you. So, we\u2019ll see you tomorrow at 10 AM for the interview, and after that, we\u2019ll have you start as soon as Friday if everything goes smoothly.\"\n\nI let out a breath, processing everything. \"Alright, I\u2019ll be there.\"\n\n\"Welcome to Freddy Fazbear\u2019s Mega Pizzaplex, John. We\u2019re excited to have you on the team.\"\n\n\"Thanks. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Take care, John.\"\n\nShe hangs up, and I stare at the phone for a moment, the weight of the conversation sinking in. Tomorrow morning. The interview starts then.\n\nThe sun barely creeps through the blinds as I drag myself out of bed. The cold morning air bites at my skin, but I force myself to get dressed. I quickly throw on a plain black shirt and some jeans, nothing special. It\u2019s just an interview. But there\u2019s something about it, something that feels like I\u2019m walking into the unknown.\n\nBy the time I get to Freddy Fazbear\u2019s Mega Pizzaplex, the streets are already buzzing with activity. Families are lined up outside, excited for the grand opening, and a few kids are bouncing around in front of the entrance, clutching their parents' hands, already talking about which animatronic they want to see. I can\u2019t help but feel a little out of place. I\u2019ve spent years chasing ghosts, trying to prove they don\u2019t exist, and here I am, walking into a place that was once infamous for strange happenings.\n\nThe building stands tall in front of me, a modern marvel of neon lights and polished glass. The sign above the door blinks with the words \"Freddy Fazbear\u2019s Mega Pizzaplex\" in bold, bright colors. The old, worn-out feel of the original pizzeria is gone. This place looks... brand new, a sleek version of what came before. The outer walls are painted in a mix of blues, purples, and yellows, like it\u2019s trying to scream fun at you from every angle.\n\nI push open the door and immediately feel the warmth of the place, the smell of fresh pizza in the air, mixed with a faint hint of cleaning chemicals. The sound of kids\u2019 laughter and chatter fills the room, and I\u2019m hit with a wall of noise. It\u2019s almost overwhelming. There\u2019s a large arcade area to my left, flashing lights from the machines drawing kids in. To my right, there\u2019s a massive counter where families are ordering pizza, their voices blending together with the sounds of the animatronics up on stage.\n\nThe stage. I can\u2019t stop myself from staring.\n\nUp front, in the center of the room, sits Toy Freddy, with his rounded belly and friendly, wide grin, his eyes following the children as they move about. He's still wearing his classic top hat, but this one\u2019s sleeker, more modern, with a polished look. He taps his foot along to the beat of a familiar tune, his robotic hands playing the keyboard with smooth, mechanical precision. Toy Bonnie, blue and vibrant with his electric guitar, strums along to the rhythm. Every note is sharp, clean, and perfectly timed, as though he's been programmed to play this song a thousand times. And beside them, Toy Chica spins her colorful maracas, shaking them in sync with the rest of the group. Her beak moves in perfect unison with her motions, a smile plastered on her face. Her feathers are pristine and glossy, and she looks more like a character from a cartoon than an animatronic.\n\nThey\u2019re all performing the same upbeat tune: \u201cFreddy Fazbear's Song.\u201d It\u2019s a classic, the one that\u2019s always been associated with this franchise, but with a new, more modern twist. The melody is the same, but the electronic instruments mixed in give it a poppy, almost radio-friendly vibe. As the animatronics sing, the kids gather around, clapping and laughing, their excitement infectious. Some of them even stand up and start dancing, as if the music is pulling them in.\n\nThe whole place feels alive, bustling with energy. The kids don\u2019t seem to care about the robot faces\u2014they\u2019re too caught up in the show. They toss pieces of pizza into their mouths, pointing excitedly at the stage as if they\u2019ve never seen anything like it. Their parents sit at the nearby tables, chatting with each other and occasionally glancing over at the performance, clearly satisfied with the experience.\n\nThe lights above flicker in time with the music, and every time the song reaches a crescendo, the whole room lights up in bursts of colorful, blinking lights. A large projection screen overhead flashes images of various characters from the pizzeria's lore, teasing new games and attractions. Even the walls seem to have been designed to add to the festive chaos of it all, with murals of the animatronics in action, dancing, singing, and interacting with the crowd.\n\nThe excitement in the air is palpable, and for a moment, it feels like a celebration. It feels... normal. Too normal. The buzz of the room, the cheer of the children, it\u2019s almost too perfect, too smooth. Like a well-oiled machine.\n\nI take a deep breath and glance around for the interview area. There\u2019s no time to think about what this place might be hiding. I have a job to do. But for now, I can\u2019t shake the feeling that something here is off. I just can\u2019t put my finger on it.\n\nAfter a few minutes of standing in the bustling pizzeria, I spot a worker who notices me lingering by the entrance. She smiles and waves me over.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the new guy, right? Come on, I\u2019ll take you to the manager,\u201d she says, her voice professional, but tinged with a hint of excitement.\n\nI follow her through the maze of brightly lit hallways, the sounds of laughter and animatronic music filling the air as we move past the arcade and through various rooms. The whole place is lively and overwhelming, and for a moment, I get lost in the noise.\n\nShe leads me into a quiet corridor and opens a door, gesturing for me to step inside. The room is modest, nothing too fancy. A polished wood desk sits in the center, papers scattered across it, a phone with a blinking light, and a couple of framed photos of the animatronics smiling down at me from the wall.\n\n\"Mr. Reynolds, this is John,\" she says, introducing me to the man behind the desk.\n\nThe manager stands, extending his hand. \"John, nice to meet you. I\u2019m Greg Reynolds, and I\u2019ll be showing you around today.\"\n\nI shake his hand, trying to keep my cool. He gestures for me to take a seat, and I do so, pulling my chair close to the desk.\n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019ve applied for the overnight security shift, huh?\u201d Greg asks, settling back into his chair. \u201cGood. We\u2019re always looking for someone dependable to keep an eye on the place. Let\u2019s go over the basics first.\u201d\n\nHe leans forward slightly, his hands clasped in front of him. \u201cYou\u2019ll be responsible for monitoring the cameras throughout the pizzeria during your shift. The cameras are all wired into the system, and you\u2019ll be able to see every corner of the building, from the dining area to the back rooms. Some areas, though, are going to be a bit more... tricky. I\u2019ll show you that in a bit.\u201d\n\nHe motions toward the desk. \u201cThis here\u2019s your main workstation. The monitors are all set up, and you\u2019ll need to keep an eye on them at all times. We don\u2019t want any surprises. And, if something goes wrong... you\u2019re going to need to keep calm, understand? We\u2019ve had incidents before, but nothing you can\u2019t handle.\u201d\n\nHe pauses, making sure I\u2019m listening, before continuing. \u201cThe animatronics are equipped with movement sensors. Most of the time, they\u2019ll stay on stage or wander through the common areas. But after hours, they move around... and you\u2019ll need to monitor them to make sure they\u2019re not causing any trouble. If you see one in an area they\u2019re not supposed to be, use the security doors to block them off.\u201d\n\nI nod slowly, absorbing the rules, trying to make sense of them.\n\nHe stands and gestures for me to follow him, leading me down the hall again. We walk past a series of doors, each with brightly colored signs indicating different attractions. The vibe here is almost carnival-like, with vibrant lights flashing and upbeat music always playing in the background.\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d he says, as we stop in front of a door that leads to what looks like a break room. \u201cThis is the security room. You\u2019ll be in here most of the time, just watching the monitors and making sure everything\u2019s running smoothly. Now, let's go ahead and take a tour of the rest of the facility. I\u2019ll show you what you\u2019re looking after at night.\u201d\n\nWe walk through the pizzeria, passing by the animatronics on stage again. Toy Freddy, Toy Bonnie, and Toy Chica are still performing, the music almost as catchy as before. But this time, I notice something else: the stage lights seem to flicker a little more than usual, like they\u2019re having trouble staying steady.\n\nWe move past the dining area, where kids are eating and playing games, all smiling, eyes wide with excitement. As we continue through the restaurant, Greg stops at the kitchen and points out the back storage areas where food is kept. Everything is meticulous and clean, like a well-oiled machine.\n\nFinally, we reach the end of the hall and stop in front of a small, nondescript door. Greg pauses, his expression turning more serious.\n\n\u201cThis is it. The office.\u201d\n\nHe opens the door, revealing a cramped, cluttered room that doesn\u2019t look anything like the rest of the pizzeria. It\u2019s dimly lit, with the only light coming from a flickering overhead bulb. There\u2019s a small desk, its surface covered in papers, and a chair tucked underneath. A camera setup sits next to the desk, its screens showing static and a few live feeds of the different rooms. Kids' drawings are taped to the walls\u2014some of them look like they\u2019ve been up for years.\n\nWhat catches my eye next is the mask on the desk. A Freddy Fazbear mask. It\u2019s not just a decoration, but a tool, it seems. My heart skips a beat as I take it in.\n\nThe room itself feels... wrong. It\u2019s too small for a full office, and the lack of any real decoration makes it feel like a forgotten corner of the building.\n\nTwo large vents are placed in opposite corners of the room, each big enough for a person to crawl through. I can\u2019t help but wonder why they don\u2019t have vent doors. It\u2019s strange. There\u2019s an eerie silence in here that the rest of the pizzeria doesn\u2019t have, like the room\u2019s holding its breath.\n\nGreg clears his throat, breaking my focus. \u201cThis is your office. You\u2019ll be here most of the night, so you\u2019ll want to keep it secure. Watch the cameras carefully, especially the hallways. If something goes wrong, you\u2019ve got your flashlight and the Freddy mask.\u201d He pauses. \u201cIf one of the animatronics gets too close, put the mask on. It\u2019s part of the security system here.\u201d\n\nI glance at the mask again, a little uncomfortable. It feels like too much, like a backup plan for something that could go wrong. But I nod anyway, taking it all in.\n\n\u201cAlright, John,\u201d Greg continues, \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much it for the tour. Your shift starts tonight. I\u2019ll leave you to get ready.\u201d\n\nHe stands up, and I do the same. \u201cYou\u2019re going to do fine,\u201d he says, offering me a reassuring smile. \u201cJust stay calm, and keep your eyes on the cameras. If you need anything, you can reach me anytime.\u201d\n\nI nod again, trying to shake off the feeling that something\u2019s off. It\u2019s just the job, right? It\u2019s just another night shift.\n\nBut the mask on the desk... I can\u2019t stop thinking about it.\n\nI stand there in the cramped office, the silence almost oppressive. Greg\u2019s voice pulls me out of my thoughts.\n\n\u201cWell, since you\u2019re already here,\u201d he says, standing up from his chair and offering a quick, business-like smile, \u201cyou can go ahead and start. Your shift\u2019ll officially begin after the place closes at 8:00. You\u2019ll be here until midnight, and then off at 6:00 AM. You\u2019re on a weekly pay of $340.\u201d\n\nMy stomach tightens at the figure. Three hundred and forty bucks a week. That\u2019s barely enough to cover rent. I nod, trying not to show how disappointed I am with the pay. The thought crosses my mind that I could\u2019ve probably found something else, but at this point, it\u2019s already a done deal. I have to see this through. I need to see it all.\n\nI force a smile. \u201cAlright, sounds good.\u201d\n\nGreg gives me one last nod, then walks out of the office, leaving me alone in the dimly lit room. It\u2019s quiet\u2014too quiet. The kind of quiet that makes you feel like you\u2019re being watched. I glance around the small space, trying to make it feel like mine, but the more I look, the more uncomfortable I feel. The mask on the desk. The papers, the drawings on the walls, the empty feeling in the room.\n\nIt\u2019s not like the usual jobs I\u2019ve had. Not by a long shot.\n\nSo, I sit there, watching the clock on the wall tick slowly toward 8:00. It\u2019s 7:30 now, and there\u2019s nothing to do but wait. The kids in the dining area are still playing, their laughter echoing through the walls, but it starts to quiet down as the minutes go by. The animatronics are still on stage, doing their thing, performing the same songs they\u2019ve been programmed to sing. Toy Freddy, Toy Bonnie, and Toy Chica\u2014they\u2019re all frozen in place, but I can\u2019t help but notice how their plastic eyes seem to watch me, even when they\u2019re not supposed to.\n\nI lean back in the chair, trying to kill time by scrolling through my phone. Nothing really catches my attention. I check the time again: 7:45. I look up at the monitors, half-expecting something to happen, but everything is calm. Too calm. The place is too\u2026 normal. Too alive.\n\nAround 8:00, the pizzeria starts to empty out, the sounds of children\u2019s voices fading as parents gather their kids to leave. The lights above flicker slightly, making everything feel a bit more surreal. One by one, the staff starts to clean up. The animatronics, still stuck in their routines, don\u2019t move from their positions on stage, but I know from the way the workers are acting that the night shift is about to begin.\n\nI can feel it now. The atmosphere shifting. The place doesn\u2019t feel so alive anymore. The kids are gone, the noise is quieter, and the workers are finishing up their tasks, oblivious to the fact that it\u2019s about to be my job to watch over this place.\n\nI sit in the office, my thoughts drifting, waiting for midnight. It\u2019s almost like I can feel the weight of the pizzeria settling in around me.\n\n8:15 rolls around. The pizzeria\u2019s now almost empty, save for a few stragglers who linger near the exit. I glance at the security monitor. Everything looks\u2026 normal. It\u2019s like I\u2019m just here to watch a bunch of robots, but something feels off.\n\nI glance over my shoulder at the vent in the back corner. It\u2019s large enough for a person to fit through. Another thing that\u2019s off. Why would a place like this have such big vents, especially ones with no doors?\n\nThe clock on the wall ticks on. It\u2019s almost as if time is stretching, slowing down, keeping me locked in this moment of anticipation.\n\n8:30. The workers start filing out of the building, and I hear the sound of doors closing in the distance. I\u2019m completely alone now. And for the first time, I can feel the heaviness of this place. It\u2019s like the walls are closing in, and the silence grows thicker with each passing second.\n\n8:45. I\u2019m staring at the monitors again, but I keep looking over my shoulder. The room feels smaller. The vents feel more\u2026 ominous. The mask on the desk catches the light, and I wonder what it\u2019s for. A backup plan? Or something more?\n\n9:00. I lean back in the chair, trying to focus. I tell myself it\u2019s just another job. That\u2019s all. Just keep watching the cameras, keep everything in check, and you\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s a job, nothing more.\n\n9:30. I\u2019m starting to lose track of time. The minutes blur together. The only sound is the soft hum of the security system and the occasional creak of the building as it settles. The monitors are showing nothing unusual. The place feels like a ghost town, like nothing\u2019s even happening.\n\nBut deep down, I know it\u2019s not going to stay like this. The place is waiting for something.\n\n10:00. It\u2019s getting closer now. My shift is starting to feel real, and the anticipation is building. A part of me is just waiting for something\u2014anything\u2014to break the stillness. Something\u2019s going to happen, I just know it.\n\n10:30. It\u2019s like the calm before the storm. The animatronics, frozen on stage, are all I can focus on. The way their eyes follow me, even when they\u2019re not supposed to.\n\nThe hours drag on. The pizzeria is so still, I wonder if anything\u2019s ever going to move.\n\nIt\u2019s nearly midnight now. It\u2019s finally time to start.\n\nI take a deep breath, adjusting the mask on the desk in front of me.\n\nHere we go.\n\nThe phone call interrupts the silence of the office, and I quickly grab the receiver. My hand shakes slightly as I bring it to my ear.\n\n\u201cUh, hello? Hello, hello?\u201d The voice on the other end crackles slightly but is clear enough.\n\nPart 2: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/StoryLord444\/s\/mQBx1URlWG\n"},"22":{"title":"D\u00e4monen M\u00fcnze pt.1","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1jinzf7\/d\u00e4monen_m\u00fcnze_pt1\/","flair":"Story","author":"ZealousidealYam4891","selftext":"On February 22nd, 1923 two young individuals welcomed their newborn baby boy to the world. The parents of young Alvin were Allison and Justin Boone, born and raised in the small town of Johnston City, Illinois. They were high school sweethearts who eloped at an early age. They moved in with Justin's father to save money. Allison took the role of a typical house wife while Justin assumed a serious role in his family business after his own father had fallen ill due to liver failure. The Boone Plumbing Company had suffered over the years thanks to Justin's father succumbing to Alcoholism in the worst way. Justin thought the occasional drink was fine but in the case of his father, two to three bottles became an every day occurrence. Within six years, Justin was solely running the company while his father remained in an alcohol induced purgatory. This created a whirlwind of stress as Justin fumbled to keep the business afloat. It became harder and harder to come home and pretend that everything was perfectly fine. Allison saw through the facade and young Alvin had little interaction with his daddy. \n\nThe boiling pot of anxiety and debt barely subsided even after Justin hired a few people to help lighten the load. He saw no point in keeping his father involved with the business, so he fired him. This had caused a fight that ended with the old man having a heart attack and dying right inside the office. Justin didn't cry at the funeral and frankly he had no feelings about watching his father die. Boone Plumbing Company was all his now but he wasn't proud of it. On top of inheriting the family business, Justin also took up the curse of the bottle. A year after the funeral, Justin was bringing his frustrations home with him. Screaming matches broke out almost every night that ended with Allison suffering a beating and Alvin crying in a corner. Fortunately for the now seven year old boy, he was too small to feel his father's full wrath. For the time being, Allison was the only punching bag.\n\nAt the beginning of the second world war, young Alvin was now seventeen and halfway through his final year of high school. Slowly becoming at least to what his father expected, a man. Football and gym routines had been a good source to relieve Alvin's aggression and frustration from the dismal times at home. His father, Justin, was still running the plumbing company and now developed a habit of passing out drunk in the office. Drunk every day and fueled with anger always caused a darkness to fill the home. By this point Allison had become a shell of her former self from all of the beatings she had recieved over the years. She had given up the will to do anything at all. Alvin tried his best to cheer his mother up but she was too far gone. Occasionally a smile would make an appearance but the eyes always remained dead within. Every night, Justin would burst in with a drunken rage. Lashing out at the scapegoat that was his wife. Alvin made the best effort to prevent the chaos but every attempt ended in failure. For his efforts, he would recieve blackened eyes, a bloody nose and once even a broken collar bone. Things never got better, just remained the same thing over and over again. A mind numbing atmosphere filled with suffering along with so much hate that you could very well strangle someone with it. \n\nThe worst came on the day of Alvin's eighteenth birthday, by this time he had finished school but did not follow in his father's foot steps to join the family business. He had become hell bent on leaving everything behind to join the fight against those \"Nazi bastards\" as his father liked to call them. Justin was torn on his feelings about his son's choices because on one hand Alvin would be in his eyes the ultimate man by going overseas to fight for his country but there was some hurt feelings and disappointment that the family business wouldn't continue through the next generation. Sadly Justin's constant intoxication had left him blind or maybe even naive to the fact that both his wife and son hated him with a passion. The truth was that Alvin wasn't leaving to serve his country but planning to get as far away as possible. Justin lived in his own little world thanks to the bottle attached to his lips and the rose colored glasses permanently attached to his face. Blind to what reality was.\n\nAlthough dead inside, Allison never missed out on the celebration of her baby boy's birthday. Every year was the same occurrence and yet it made Alvin feel his happiest because it caused the rare occasion for his mother to show a sliver of her former self. A cherished moment indeed. She baked the same cake with a single candle, his age written out in icing. Justin would always be sitting in his chair with a drink in his hand while, barely present. Alison sang Happy Birthday in a weakened tone that somehow kept perfect harmony. There were no gifts given after Alvin had turned sixteen because a \"real man\" didn't need anything he couldn't earn himself. The lack of presents didn't never bother Alvin because seeing the light briefly return to his mother was the only gift he looked forward to. But this birthday felt different than all of the others. Nothing in particular that the young man could point out yet, something in the air gave him a slight chill down his spine. Something weighed heavy on his heart, it could've been the news of leaving for boot camp but even that didn't feel like enough to cause what he was feeling.\n\nThe day had went fairly well with a few friends accompanying Alvin, trotting down the streets of town to go check out the different shops and whatnot. They saw a few girls down by Larson's corner store and told them about plans of the future after his return from the war. After a while it was time for Alvin to head home. As he approached, that heavy sensation pulled at his chest again. Walking to the steps, he noticed all the lights were off, save for the one farthest to the left of the house. Alvin turned the door handle to a living room drenched in complete darkness with only a sliver of light emitting from the cracked door of the hallway bathroom. It was completely silent which was almost deafening to his ears and the only sound heard was the beating of his increasingly thumping heart. He called out for his mother but the only reply was the echo of his own voice. His slow steps towards the bathroom were met with a soggy slurp of his foot to wet carpet. He paused for a brief moment to look down. The slim array of the bathroom light revealed a dark red stain. He gently pushed the door open, creating an obnoxious squeak. The next sound was that of a guttural wail from Alvin's mouth. \n\nHe saw an arm dangling off the edge of the tub resembling that of a doll. His mother's body was displayed in a watery red pool filled with her own blood. The fluid had escaped from slashes across various parts of her face and body. She was savagely stabbed and cut from something that left long and jagged wounds. A massive gash on the side of her neck was still releasing droplets of crimson that fell into the tub. Alvin dry heaved when he noticed that her left eye socket was in full grisly display with the eyeball itself hanging by a single strand of muscle tissue. The orb rested on his mother's cheek. It was clear that this attack had been fierce and fueled by hate judging by the blood that splattered the walls, mirror and even parts hitting the ceiling with such veracity. This was an act of pure primal rage with intent to completely destroy. Alvin eyes burned from the bright light and his throat was sore from the continuous screaming that spewed out. The sound echoed so loudly through the house that his ears began to ring in pain. The kindest woman he had ever known was gone and destroyed in the most savage way he could have possibly imagined. His mind raced, his legs shook and grisly thoughts kept bouncing within his head until it all fell silent with the muffled sound of someone's laughter. \n\nIt was a slow slurred chuckle coming from somewhere behind him, far off in the distance. Alvin wasn't entirely sure where or from whom it was coming from. The sound snapped him back to reality. He got to his feet to try and discover what sick bastard thought his mother's murder was so god damn funny. The ominous laughter continued, pausing briefly for the person to catch their breath in order to start back up again. The melody of the sound lead him to the garage which was located on the opposite end of the hallway from the front of the house. Alvin didn't grab anything to defend himself or even prepare for an attack because, to him, world had ended. He was ready if he was to be next on the murder list. He opened the door to the garage where the sinister tones resonated loudly from the throat of his drunken and bloodied father. Lit up by a rusty lamp set on a small makeshift end table, Justin Boone was sitting in a wicker chair cackling. \n\nA full bottle of liquor in one hand and a broken one in the other that was dripping blood from a shattered end. Alvin flipped the main light switch to iliminate his father in a chair giggling with a cigarette set between his lips. The man's eyes were barely opened and completely bloodshot from obvious gulps that had emptied the shattered bottle the one bottle. Alvin spewed the words from the bottom of his gut to catch the monster's attention, \"What did you do?! What did you do to her?!\" His throat ached after the release of words. His father was beyond drunk at this point so it took several moments before the words even registered in his head or even realized who had spoke them. Finally, Justin looked up at his shaking and distraught son then paused before smirking to spit out a response.\n\n\"ooooooh....h-h-heey birshday boyee.\" A huge glob of saliva slowly oozed from his bottom lip. \"Im ssssssooo glud you m-m-made it.\" Every word was like a nail being driven into Alvin's skull. He was dumbfounded as to what he should even do at this point with his father so far gone. He wanted to strangle the heartless son of a bitch but his body refused to move. He remained frozen as if completely paralyzed. Justin shifted in his chair then opened one eye wide in an attempt to really focus on Alvin then let out another chuckle before slurring once more. \"It wash jut er time ta go.\" A sickening grin stretched along each corner of that disheveled face. The monster spoke again. \"Hey b-b-boy.....lisken. I had to do it.\nHe inhaled from his cigarette then gave a long exhale that released a toxic cloud of smoke. \"Sees you in hell, boy.\" \n\nBefore Alvin could move or utter a word, Justin took a huge gulp from one bottle then dropped it before raising the broken one to his throat. With a fierce stabbing motion he pierced open the flesh of his neck and continued to tear open the wound revealing muscle and tendons that were being drowned in a river of red. He coughed and gurgled spilling blood in a projectile motion that landed onto Alvin's shoes. The birthday boy watched the bottle drop from his father's dead hand and the blood drain from the enormous laceration until it finally became a slow drip.\n\nHours passed before Alvin could leave that frozen state to call the cops and report the murder suicide of his parents. There was never a true explanation as to why his father really killed his mother other than that garbled drunken nonsense ejected from his mouth. The question would never be answered, neither would the question as to why the Boone Plumbing Company building had been vandalized and odd unintelligible phrases scrolled in what was later confirmed to be blood, all over the office walls. Or why in the basement of the building the bodies of the two employees had been found in various forms of desecration. One was found tied upside down dangling from a support beam with his head removed, his blood collected in a bucket underneath and over sixty seven stab wounds throughout his torso. His head was found in a shoe box sitting on the passenger seat of Justin's truck. The second victim had been fastened to the foundation wall with large cemetery screw, displayed like Jesus on the cross. There were no stab wounds, however his eyes had been removed and his face had been bludgeoned by a hammer that was found next to his body. The eyes of the second victim were never found. Justin was a mean drunk and was known to beat on his wife and kid but the acts in which he had done the day of Alvin's birthday seemed too hard to believe. Alvin left the next week to join in the fight against Germany never looking back when he got on that bus. He had no other family that he was aware of so all he had now was himself. It was time to move on and escape the hell he had just witnessed to move to the next hell that awaited him in the trenches.\n"},"23":{"title":"The tall man in my basement","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1jiehif\/the_tall_man_in_my_basement\/","flair":"Story","author":"StoryLord444","selftext":"The basement was cold and damp, the air thick and stale. He stood there, towering, his head nearly brushing the ceiling. His features were long and slender, limbs stretched unnaturally. His arms hung low, fingers almost grazing his knees. His legs, thin and bone-like, made him stand at an impossible 12 feet tall.\n\nHis mouth stretched wide \u2014 too wide \u2014 an unnatural stretched mouth that revealed nothing but a black void inside. His eyes, deep and hollow, were pits of endless darkness, a void that seemed to pull everything in.\n\nI don't remember how it got there or how it even got inside. All I know is I locked it deep in my basement where it couldn\u2019t come out.\n\nWell, that was until I found the basement door wide open.\n\n\"Hello,\" I said, staring into the dark basement that yawned open before me. My voice felt small, swallowed by the shadows below.\n\nFear crawled up my throat, thick and sour, like I might throw it up. I slammed the door shut, my hands shaking.\n\nThen I heard it \u2014 soft, rattling noises from the kitchen. Gentle, deliberate, like something was moving in there.\n\nSomething was in the house with me.\n\nI moved deliberately, each step slow and careful, my breath caught in my throat. I watched my surroundings, making no noise as I crept toward the kitchen.\n\nAnd then I saw it.\n\nThe creature from my basement stood at the sink, its towering frame hunched awkwardly beneath the ceiling. It stared out the window, motionless, its long, slender limbs hanging at its sides.\n\nIt didn\u2019t move. It didn\u2019t make a sound. It just stood there, like it belonged.\n\nMy heart slammed against my ribs as I bolted for the front door, feet barely touching the ground. I didn\u2019t dare look back \u2014 I didn\u2019t need to.\n\nThe roar came first, splitting the air like a thunderclap. It wasn\u2019t human. It wasn\u2019t animal. It was deep, raw, and wrong, vibrating through my bones, rattling my teeth. My legs nearly gave out from the sound alone, but fear shoved me forward.\n\nI hit the door hard, bursting into the cold night air. My car was just ahead, parked in the driveway. My keys \u2014 I needed my keys. My hand dove into my pocket, fingers trembling as I fumbled them out.\n\nBehind me, the door exploded open with a splintering crack. Heavy, unnatural footsteps pounded against the ground, fast \u2014 too fast. I didn\u2019t have to see it to know it was coming. I could feel it closing the distance.\n\nI reached the car, yanked the door open, and threw myself inside. My hands shook so badly the keys slipped from my fingers and hit the floor mat.\n\n\u201cNo, no, no\u2014\u201d\n\nI grabbed them again, forcing the key into the ignition. The engine sputtered, coughed \u2014 the sound of death.\n\nThe creature lunged from the doorway, its long, bony limbs propelling it forward in a blur of twisted movement. It was nearly to the car.\n\nThe engine roared to life.\n\nI slammed the gear into reverse, tires squealing as I stomped the gas. The car jolted backward, throwing me against the seat as the creature lunged, just barely missing the hood. Its empty black eyes locked onto mine for a split second, burning into me before I peeled out of the driveway.\n\nI didn\u2019t stop. My foot stayed pressed to the floor, the car flying down the long, dark street. The night swallowed everything around me, but I didn\u2019t care where I was going \u2014 as long as it wasn\u2019t back there.\n\nDays passed. I barely slept, holed up in a cheap hotel on the edge of town. The room smelled like old cigarettes and stale air, but it didn\u2019t matter. It had four walls and a locked door.\n\nEvery night, I checked the window \u2014 just to be sure.\n\nThat night was no different. I pulled back the curtain, heart already racing before I even looked. The parking lot below was empty, streetlights flickering weakly against the dark. For a second, I let myself believe I was safe.\n\nThen I saw it.\n\nBeyond the lot, past the stretch of cracked asphalt and the rusted chain-link fence, the woods began \u2014 thick, black trees rising like jagged teeth. And there, just at the edge where the trees met the night, it stood.\n\nThe tall, twisted figure.\n\nIt didn\u2019t move. It didn\u2019t blink. It only stared, watching me from the shadows.\n\nIt found me.\n\nIn an instant, I yanked the curtains shut, heart slamming against my ribs. My breath came in quick, shaky bursts. I sprinted to the door, peering through the peephole \u2014 nothing. The hallway outside was empty, still and quiet.\n\nI didn\u2019t know how fast it was. I didn\u2019t know how smart it was. But it found me.\n\nHours crawled by. The TV droned on in the background, some late-night sitcom I wasn\u2019t paying attention to. I kept glancing at the window, half-expecting to see it again.\n\nThen came the knock.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t loud, just a soft, deliberate tapping. My head snapped toward the door, dread sinking like a cold weight in my chest.\n\nWho the hell could that be?\n\nI slid off the bed, feet hitting the floor. Before I reached the door, I heard it \u2014 a voice.\n\n\"Hello... I need help. Help me. Help me... I need help. Help me.\"\n\nIt didn\u2019t sound right. It was flat, robotic, like a bad recording played over and over. No emotion. No urgency.\n\nI froze. My throat tightened.\n\n\"If you don\u2019t leave right now, I\u2019m calling the police!\" I shouted, voice trembling.\n\nThe voice didn\u2019t stop.\n\n\"Help me. I need help. Open the door. Open the door. Open the door.\"\n\nIt wasn\u2019t even yelling \u2014 just that same lifeless, droning tone. That was the worst part. The calmness. Like it wasn\u2019t asking. Like it was telling.\n\nMy hands fumbled for my phone. I dialed 911, fingers shaking so hard I almost hit the wrong numbers.\n\nThe voice stopped.\n\nMy stomach twisted. It was like it knew.\n\nThe operator answered. I explained everything \u2014 the voice, the knocking, the thing in the woods. My words tumbled out fast, frantic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll send someone,\u201d they said. \u201cBut it might take a few hours.\u201d\n\nA few hours.\n\nMy heart sank. My hand shook so badly the phone nearly slipped from my ear.\n\nI didn\u2019t hang up. I didn\u2019t move.\n\nI just stared at the door, waiting.\n\nOut of fear, I asked, \u201cCould you\u2026 could you just stay on the line until they come? I don\u2019t want to be alone.\u201d\n\nAt first, she hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir. We can\u2019t do that. We have to answer other calls\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d I cut in, my voice trembling. \u201cPlease. I\u2014I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll make it if I\u2019m alone.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause. I could hear her breathing on the other end. Then, quietly, she said, \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll stay.\u201d\n\nRelief washed over me, but it didn\u2019t chase the fear away. My eyes stayed locked on the door.\n\nHer voice was calm, gentle. \u201cMy name\u2019s Rachel. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\nI swallowed hard. \u201cIt\u2019s... it\u2019s James.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright, James. I\u2019m here with you. You\u2019re not alone.\u201d\n\nMy throat tightened. \u201cThank you. I\u2026 I think it\u2019s still out there.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you still hear the voice?\u201d she asked softly.\n\nI shook my head, even though she couldn\u2019t see me. \u201cNo. It stopped when I called you. But\u2026 the way it sounded\u2014\u201d I paused, shuddering at the memory. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t normal. It was like\u2026 robotic. Repeating itself over and over.\u201d\n\nRachel was quiet for a moment, then said, \u201cYou\u2019re doing great, James. Just stay with me. The officers are on their way.\u201d\n\nI nodded again, trying to steady my breathing. But deep down, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that the quiet wasn\u2019t a good thing.\n\nIt felt like the calm before something worse.\n\nRachel\u2019s voice came through the phone again, steady but a little more serious.\n\n\u201cJames\u2026 who\u2019s chasing you? Can you describe them?\u201d\n\nI opened my mouth, but nothing came out. My throat felt tight, like the words got stuck halfway up.\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know,\u201d I said finally. It wasn\u2019t a lie \u2014 not really. \u201cIt\u2019s tall. Really tall. Its arms are\u2026 too long. Its mouth\u2026\u201d My voice trailed off. My mind replayed that black void, the hollow eyes. My stomach twisted.\n\n\u201cToo long?\u201d Rachel asked gently. \u201cJames, are you saying it\u2019s someone wearing a mask or\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I cut in, my voice cracking. \u201cIt\u2019s not a mask. It\u2019s not\u2026 human.\u201d\n\nThe line went quiet for a moment. I heard her breathe in.\n\n\u201cJames,\u201d she said slowly, carefully, \u201care you sure? Could it be someone in a costume, maybe? Sometimes, when we\u2019re scared, our minds\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what I saw!\u201d I snapped, louder than I meant to. My voice echoed off the hotel walls, and I flinched at how desperate I sounded.\n\nRachel didn\u2019t react. She stayed calm. \u201cOkay. I believe you. You\u2019re doing great, James. Just stay with me, alright? The officers are still on their way.\u201d\n\nMy chest felt tight, like I couldn\u2019t get a full breath. My eyes stayed locked on the door.\n\nI couldn\u2019t tell her the truth \u2014 not all of it. If I said a monster crawled out of my basement and followed me to a hotel, they\u2019d think I lost my mind. Maybe I had.\n\nBut the thing outside? The voice? It wasn\u2019t in my head.\n\nIt was real.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t gone.\n\nAn hour passed in what felt like seconds. The room was still, but I couldn\u2019t escape the feeling that something was wrong. My pulse thudded in my ears, every breath a battle against the rising panic. Rachel\u2019s voice kept me tethered to reality, her calm words a thread I clung to.\n\nThen, suddenly, a knock at the door.\n\nKnock Knock\n\nI froze. The hairs on my neck stood up.\n\n\u201cHello, this is the police. Open the door. This is the police. Open the door.\u201d\n\nA wave of relief flooded through me. I wasn\u2019t alone. Finally. The officers were here.\n\nI rushed to the door, heart pounding in my chest. I glanced at my phone to make sure I hadn\u2019t missed anything, and there it was \u2014 the call still connected, Rachel\u2019s voice as steady as ever.\n\n\u201cJames, stay calm. They\u2019re on their way.\u201d\n\nI could hear the muffled voice of the \u201cofficer\u201d outside, repeating the same line. The door was within reach. I grabbed the handle, yanked it open, ready to let in the safety of the police.\n\nBut there it stood.\n\nThe creature.\n\nIt towered, its limbs unnaturally long, bent in sickening angles. Its black, empty eyes locked onto mine. The grin that stretched across its face was wide and chilling \u2014 too wide.\n\nI looked down at my phone in my trembling hands. The screen read:\n\n\u201c911. What\u2019s your emergency?\u201d\n\nA smile twisted across the creature\u2019s face. It wasn\u2019t the officer. It never was.\n\nI staggered back, my blood running cold. My stomach dropped into a pit of icy dread.\n\nAnd then it hit me. Rachel never asked for my location.\n\nI had never been on the phone with the police.\n\nI had been talking to it. God help me.\n\n"},"24":{"title":"The Truth about Kirby's Nightmareland","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1jikxhk\/the_truth_about_kirbys_nightmareland\/","flair":"Story","author":"Thin-Leadership-5244","selftext":"[https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/18UIrw3eQHZGgb1XCKLWSbRMdTtdIdEFqbBe7K2GYaW4\/edit?tab=t.0](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/18UIrw3eQHZGgb1XCKLWSbRMdTtdIdEFqbBe7K2GYaW4\/edit?tab=t.0)"},"25":{"title":"SUCIDE Fabr\u00edcio.avi","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1jiably\/sucide_fabr\u00edcioavi\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Odd_Explanation_6212","selftext":"Essa \u00e9 uma Creepypasta que eu inventei antes foi ano passado que inventei essa Creepypasta nesse ano ela est\u00e1 na pens\u00e3o 3 vers\u00e3o 3 voc\u00eas podem recriar esse v\u00eddeo e postar na internet s\u00f3 que com voc\u00eas podem criar essa vers\u00e3o esse v\u00eddeo voc\u00eas podem tamb\u00e9m colocar algum efeito de distor\u00e7\u00e3o no cen\u00e1rio onde Fabr\u00edcio t\u00e1 andando voc\u00ea \u00e9 f*** e recriar esse v\u00eddeo eu permito recriar esse v\u00eddeo"},"26":{"title":"Randy The Doll","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1jhdou2\/randy_the_doll\/","flair":"Story","author":"StoryLord444","selftext":"I gripped the steering wheel tightly, the hum of the engine filling the silence of the car as I drove down the quiet street. The sky outside was darkening, a faint amber glow lingering on the horizon from the last hints of daylight. In the backseat, Eli\u2019s voice cut through the calm, filled with enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cDad, are we almost there?\u201d\n\nI glanced in the rearview mirror and met his eager blue eyes. He was bouncing in his seat, his small hands clutching the seatbelt like it was his only lifeline.\n\n\u201cAlmost, buddy,\u201d I said, my voice steady but carrying the weight of a quiet fatigue. It had been a long week, and my mind had been consumed with work. But this... this was for Eli.\n\nThe toy. Randy the Doll.\n\nEli had seen the commercial just two days ago, and since then, he\u2019d hardly talked about anything else. The way he described it, the doll seemed like the answer to all his childhood wishes\u2014eyes that blinked, a voice that spoke to you, the kind of toy that made you feel like it was alive.\n\nI wasn\u2019t exactly thrilled about the idea. I had my doubts, of course\u2014who wouldn\u2019t, after seeing those ridiculous commercials? But when Eli begged, his bright eyes full of hope, it became impossible to resist.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it, Dad. I promise,\u201d Eli had whispered earlier, his voice barely more than a whisper, as if he already knew this toy was something special.\n\nThe glow of the toy store\u2019s neon sign appeared on the horizon as we neared the corner. It was an old, familiar place, one that had been around for as long as I could remember. The shelves inside were always packed with the latest trends, the next big thing, and some oddities that made me feel like I had stepped into another world.\n\nI slowed the car and turned into the parking lot, the tires crunching over the gravel. The store\u2019s lights spilled out onto the pavement, casting a warm, inviting glow. It all seemed so normal, just another stop in our evening routine.\n\nEli scrambled out of the car before I\u2019d even come to a full stop. His excitement was infectious.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go, Dad! Let\u2019s go get Randy!\u201d\n\nI chuckled, shaking my head. \u201cAlright, alright. Keep your shoes on, kiddo.\u201d\n\nWe made our way toward the entrance, Eli already running ahead, his little feet pounding the pavement. I followed at a slower pace, my steps measured but my mind clouded. I felt tired, but it didn\u2019t matter. Tonight, Eli would be happy. That\u2019s what mattered.\n\nThe bell above the door jingled as we entered the store, and the scent of new plastic and cardboard hit us. The toy aisle stretched out ahead, shelves stacked high with dolls, action figures, and games. At the very end, under a brightly lit display, sat Randy.\n\nI couldn\u2019t take my eyes off the doll. It looked almost too perfect, too pristine, sitting there like a little sentinel. Eli was already moving toward it, his face lighting up as he saw the toy in person for the first time.\n\n\u201cThere he is, Dad! Randy! He\u2019s real!\u201d Eli\u2019s voice trembled with excitement as he reached for the box, pulling it off the shelf.\n\nI smiled, watching the joy flood his face. It was a simple thing, a toy, but to Eli, it was everything. And that was enough for me.\n\n\u201cAlright, let\u2019s get him,\u201d I said, stepping forward to grab the toy from Eli\u2019s hands, his eyes wide and eager.\n\nEverything was fine. Perfectly fine.\n\nBut something about the doll... there was just something a little off.\n\nRandy the Doll stood out on the shelf, its features perfectly crafted but oddly unsettling in their perfection. Its small, chubby face was framed by wild, unkempt red hair that stuck out in all directions, as if it had been brushed once and left to grow with a mind of its own. The doll\u2019s eyes were a glossy, lifelike shade of blue, so clear they almost seemed to follow you around the room. Its porcelain cheeks were soft, but there was a faint, unnatural flush to them, like someone had overdone the blush.\n\nRandy wore faded overalls, but unlike the worn-in look they should\u2019ve had, these were bright, almost unnaturally so, as if they had never seen a day of dirt or wear. The fabric was stiff, the straps sitting squarely on the doll\u2019s tiny shoulders, each button fastened perfectly. Underneath was a blue and yellow striped shirt, the colors sharp against its pale skin. The stripes looked too perfect, the lines too straight, as if they were machine-made. The sleeves were too long, the fabric bunching awkwardly at the wrists.\n\nOn its feet were tiny sneakers, their white soles gleaming under the store lights. The laces tied neatly with a bow. They looked like they should\u2019ve been dirtier, from the imagined adventures Randy would go on, but they were pristine.\n\nEverything about the doll\u2019s outfit screamed \"playful\" at first glance, but there was something strange about how perfect it was\u2014like a display in a store window, carefully arranged to look casual, but never truly lived in. It felt like Randy wasn\u2019t meant to be played with, but simply observed.\n\nIt sat there, still, strangely inviting, as if it was waiting for someone to notice it.\n\nEli\u2019s fingers trembled with excitement as he reached for the doll, his small hands brushing against the smooth plastic surface. He grasped Randy and lifted it off the shelf, his face a mixture of awe and disbelief.\n\nWithout thinking, Eli pressed the small, circular button on Randy's chest\u2014just like the commercial had shown.\n\nThe doll\u2019s eyes glistened under the harsh fluorescent lights, and then it came to life. A soft, mechanical voice crackled from its mouth, too cheerful, too smooth.\n\n\u201cHi! I\u2019m Randy! Let\u2019s play a game!\u201d\n\nEli jumped back, startled by the sudden movement. Randy\u2019s mouth shifted to form the words, but it felt... off. There was a delay before it spoke, as if the doll wasn\u2019t quite sure how to sound human. The voice was too chipper, almost rehearsed.\n\nBut Eli didn\u2019t notice any of that. His face lit up with pure joy, and he laughed, hugging the doll tighter. The chill running up my spine went unnoticed by him.\n\n\u201cDad! It talks! It really talks!\u201d Eli\u2019s voice was filled with excitement. He pressed the button again, eager for more.\n\n\"Hi! I\u2019m Randy! Let\u2019s play a game!\" the doll repeated, its tone unchanged, unblinking.\n\nI stood there for a moment, watching the scene unfold. A shiver traveled down my back, but I couldn\u2019t place why. It was just a toy, right? A doll that talked. Nothing more.\n\nBut Eli\u2019s happiness was contagious, and for a moment, I pushed the unease aside.\n\n\u201cAlright, buddy,\u201d I said, forcing a smile as I placed a hand on Eli\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s get Randy home. We\u2019ve got a game to play.\u201d\n\nEli nodded eagerly, holding Randy high above his head. The doll fell silent, mouth frozen in its perfect grin.\n\nWe walked to the counter, the soft click of Randy\u2019s box against Eli\u2019s hands echoing in the stillness of the store. The cashier scanned it without a word, her eyes tired, her smile faint and distant.\n\nI paid in cash, fingers brushing against the crinkled bills. The exchange was routine, and the woman handed me the change. \u201cThanks,\u201d she mumbled, barely looking up.\n\nI nodded, my mind already drifting back to Eli. His face was a picture of joy, eyes wide with wonder, the doll clutched tightly in his hands.\n\nOutside, the cool air greeted us, the evening settling in around us. Eli was already in the backseat before I\u2019d even closed the car door. The toy, still in its box, sat silently in his lap.\n\nI started the car, the engine\u2019s hum filling the space. Eli\u2019s excitement was palpable, but I couldn\u2019t shake the knot in my stomach, the unease that refused to fade.\n\n\u201cAre we almost home, Dad?\u201d Eli asked from the backseat, his voice eager.\n\n\u201cYeah, just a few more minutes,\u201d I replied, glancing in the rearview mirror. Eli was holding Randy so tightly, the doll almost looked like an extension of him.\n\nWhen we pulled into the driveway, Eli was out of the car before I\u2019d even turned off the engine. He was practically bouncing with excitement. I grabbed the keys from the ignition and followed him inside, carrying only the single, unremarkable toy.\n\nAt the door, Eli struggled to unlock it, his tiny hands fumbling with the keys. Once inside, he darted down the hall, nearly running into the walls in his haste.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Dad! I gotta play with Randy!\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t respond right away. I stood for a moment, watching Eli disappear down the hall, my heart heavy with a feeling I couldn\u2019t explain. But it was fleeting, replaced by the sound of Eli\u2019s laughter echoing from his room. The excitement in his voice was contagious. He was happy, and that was all that mattered, right?\n\nI shook off the unease, slowly making my way down the hall. Everything would be fine. It was just a doll.\n\nI was greeted by my wife as I walked through the door, her tired eyes searching my face as she asked, \"Did he get the toy yet? The one he's been asking for?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I replied, trying to keep the fatigue out of my voice. \"I got it for him.\"\n\nHer smile was soft but still tired, the kind of smile you give after a long day. \"Good. He'll be thrilled.\"\n\nI nodded, but there was a weight in the air that I couldn't quite explain. It wasn't anything specific\u2014just a strange feeling, a lingering tension that I couldn't shake.\n\nThat night, after we got Eli settled and in bed, I went through my usual routine. I got ready for bed, brushing my teeth, and trying to unwind. I felt the exhaustion of the day creeping up on me as I lay in the quiet dark, the hum of the night air conditioning filling the room.\n\nBut then, just as I was about to drift off, I heard something.\n\nA soft noise coming from the kitchen.\n\nMy heart skipped a beat, and I blinked at the dark ceiling, listening closely. I strained my ears, unsure if it was just my mind playing tricks. But there it was again\u2014an unmistakable sound, like something had fallen or shifted.\n\nI reached over and glanced at the clock on the dresser beside the bed. The glowing numbers blinked back at me, 12:36 a.m.\n\nIt felt wrong\u2014so late, so still. And yet, something about it made me feel like I had to check.\n\nI slipped out of bed quietly, trying not to disturb my wife, who was already deep in sleep. The floorboards creaked under my weight as I made my way through the darkened hallway.\n\nThe kitchen was pitch-black except for the faint glow from the streetlights filtering in through the window.\n\nThen, my eyes landed on something that made my stomach turn.\n\nThere, on the counter, sat Randy the Doll. But that wasn\u2019t what made my blood run cold. It was the knife beside him. A large kitchen knife, its silver blade catching the faint light from outside, looking so out of place next to the doll.\n\nFor a moment, I just stood there, my feet frozen to the floor. The doll's eyes stared back at me, lifeless but somehow unsettling. The silence felt suffocating, as if the air itself was holding its breath.\n\nI blinked and took a shaky step forward. Had Eli gotten up and put that knife next to Randy? Or maybe I had, without realizing. Or\u2026 had my wife? The questions swirled in my mind, but none of the answers made sense.\n\nI stepped closer, slowly, my hand hovering over the knife. My heart pounded in my chest.\n\nI grabbed the knife, trying to steady my shaking hand, and placed it back on the counter, away from the doll. But something inside me still felt... wrong.\n\nI couldn\u2019t leave it there, not like that.\n\nI picked Randy up from the counter, feeling the cold weight of it in my hands, its small form still so perfect, so unnaturally pristine. The kind of toy that shouldn't feel so wrong in the dark.\n\nI didn\u2019t know why I did it, but I walked into Eli\u2019s room, still holding the doll. His soft breathing filled the quiet as I gently placed Randy next to him, sitting him up beside his son.\n\n\"Everything's fine,\" I whispered to myself, but the words felt hollow.\n\nI stood there for a moment longer, just staring at the two of them. Eli, peaceful in his sleep, and the doll, lifeless as always but somehow now a little more... sinister.\n\nI shook my head, trying to shake the unease off. I needed sleep. Everything would be fine. It was just a doll.\n\nBut as I turned to leave, the feeling in my gut told me something wasn't quite right.\n\nAnd I couldn't escape the sensation that something\u2014someone\u2014was watching me from the darkness.\n\nAs I turned to leave Eli\u2019s room, my footsteps slow and deliberate, I heard it\u2014bang. The door slammed shut behind me with a force that made my heart leap into my throat.\n\nI froze, every muscle tensed in panic. My breath caught in my chest, the sound of the door slamming echoing in the empty house.\n\n\"Jesus Christ,\" I muttered under my breath, my body stiff with sudden fear. My mind raced, and I turned back to the door with shaking hands. What the hell had just happened?\n\nI reached for the handle, my pulse pounding in my ears, and slowly, carefully, I opened it. I expected to find Eli standing there, his little face lit up with some mischievous grin. But the room was as silent as a tomb.\n\nNo one.\n\nThe bed was still, the blanket untouched. The doll sat next to Eli, just as I\u2019d left it. But the door\u2014how had it slammed shut like that?\n\nI stepped inside, my mind struggling to piece things together. Was Eli awake? Had he gotten up and slammed the door in his sleep?\n\nBut there was no sign of him stirring, no sign of anything out of the ordinary. Just the dark shadows in the room and the strange, unsettling feeling creeping back into my bones.\n\nI stood there for a long moment, staring at the empty room.\n\nWhat the hell was going on?\n\nI couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that something was wrong\u2014terribly wrong. I didn\u2019t want to jump to conclusions, but... the doll, the knife, the door slamming shut by itself\u2014it all felt like too much of a coincidence.\n\nI stepped back out of the room, my hand still gripping the door handle as I tried to process what had just happened. My mind kept circling back to the same question: What\u2019s happening to us?\n\nBut no matter how hard I tried to rationalize it, a cold, creeping dread began to settle deep inside me. Something was watching, something was waiting. I just didn\u2019t know what it was yet.\n\nAnd the more I thought about it, the more I realized\u2014I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to know.\n\nThe morning light filtered through the blinds, casting soft rays across the room. I woke up to an empty bed, as usual. My wife, Mary, had always been an early riser, but today, something felt off. The silence in the house was deafening. No soft sound of her humming or the faint clinking of dishes from the kitchen.\n\nI rubbed my eyes, stretching out of bed, and glanced around. I didn\u2019t hear anything coming from Eli\u2019s room either, which was strange. Usually, he was up before the sun, but this morning, everything was unnervingly still.\n\nI pulled on my slippers and walked down the hallway. The smell of pancakes and sizzling eggs hit me first. I breathed it in, the familiar, comforting aroma of breakfast. It was like nothing had changed. Mary was at the stove, flipping pancakes with that careful precision she always had. The eggs\u2014scrambled, soft, with just the right amount of seasoning\u2014were almost ready.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just the food that caught my attention. Sitting at the kitchen table was Eli, his small frame hunched over the table. And next to him, sitting upright in a chair, was the doll\u2014Randy. Its expression as still and lifeless as before, but somehow, this time, it looked different. It didn\u2019t seem out of place at all. It was just another part of the family now, like it had always belonged there.\n\nI stared at the doll for a moment longer than I should have. It felt wrong. Why was it sitting at the table? Why did it feel like a part of our morning routine now?\n\n\u201cGood morning, honey,\u201d I said, walking up to Mary and kissing her on the cheek. She smiled at me, her eyes bright, like she hadn\u2019t just been in the kitchen for hours, but only a moment.\n\n\u201cGood morning, love,\u201d she replied, her voice warm as always. But there was something about her smile, something that seemed a little too... forced?\n\nEli\u2019s voice broke my thoughts.\n\n\"Daddy, Randy\u2019s hungry. Is the food ready yet?\" he asked, his innocent face so earnest as he looked at me. He didn\u2019t seem to notice how strange it was to have that damn doll at the table with us.\n\nI glanced back at my wife, who was now putting a plate of pancakes down in front of Eli. Her eyes flicked from the doll to me, and I couldn't help the confused, uneasy feeling creeping up my spine.\n\n\"Mary, are you really going to make this doll food?\" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady, though I couldn\u2019t help the strange edge to my words. She didn\u2019t respond right away, just continued to place the pancakes on the table.\n\nThere was a pause, and she looked at me, her expression unreadable for a brief moment. \"It\u2019s just a doll, John,\" she said, her tone soft but laced with something I couldn\u2019t place. \"It\u2019s just... pretend.\"\n\nBut I wasn\u2019t convinced. This was more than pretend. Something was wrong, and no matter how much I tried to push it away, I could feel it, deep in my gut\u2014like I was being drawn into something darker than I could understand.\n\nAs I sat down, I kept my eyes on Randy, feeling a chill settle over me. Something about this breakfast, this normal morning routine, felt anything but normal.\n\nThe sound of silverware clinking against plates filled the kitchen as we sat down together. Mary placed the final stack of pancakes on the table, the steam rising off them, and Eli eagerly reached for his syrup. The doll, Randy, sat as if it were just another member of the family, its glassy eyes staring at the scene before it. The morning felt oddly routine, but beneath the surface, something was off.\n\nEli took a bite of his pancakes, chewing thoughtfully before breaking the silence in his usual innocent way. His voice was soft, but what he said froze me in my seat.\n\n\"Daddy, Randy said that when you made him leave the kitchen, he was mad at you,\" Eli began, his tone so casual, so childlike. \"He called you a bitch and said that he would kill you if you do that again.\"\n\nI blinked, unable to fully process what I had just heard. Mary\u2019s face shifted, and she glanced at me\u2014just a quick look, but it was enough for me to know we were both equally confused. I turned back to Eli, my heart racing.\n\n\"Eli,\" I said, my voice firm but trying not to sound too harsh. \"You don't say those types of words in this house, ever. Not inside, not outside, nowhere. That is a bad word.\"\n\nThe weight of my words seemed to settle in the room, and Eli looked down at his plate, his small hands folding in his lap. He mumbled a quiet, almost apologetic \"Sorry, Daddy. I won't do it again.\"\n\nI stared at him for a moment, trying to understand what just happened. He spoke so innocently, without even the slightest hint of understanding the gravity of what he\u2019d said. But that didn't make it any less disturbing.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to steady myself. The air around us felt thick, tense. As I glanced at Mary again, her face was pale, a mix of confusion and something else I couldn\u2019t quite place. But her lips tightened in a thin line, and she avoided my gaze, focusing on Eli as if trying to keep some semblance of normalcy.\n\nStill, my mind kept coming back to those words\u2014Randy said he\u2019d kill me. A doll, an inanimate object, supposedly said this. I shook my head, trying to clear the absurdity from my thoughts, but it lingered, thick and oppressive.\n\nI couldn't shake the feeling that something deeper was happening, something that neither Mary nor I were prepared to face. But at that moment, the noise of silverware scraping against the plate pulled me back into the present. Eli was eating again, as if nothing had happened. And Randy sat beside him, its unblinking eyes staring at me, as if waiting for something. But what?\n\nI grabbed my bag, slammed the car door shut, and quickly made my way inside. The house was eerily quiet. I hesitated at the front door, a chill running down my spine. The silence felt suffocating, unnatural, like something was waiting in the shadows.\n\nAs I stepped inside, I glanced around. No Mary. No Eli. But then I froze. The doll. Randy. It was sitting on the living room couch, its little body propped up against the cushions, watching the news. The TV was on, the sound low, but it didn\u2019t matter\u2014the sight of the doll sitting there, motionless, its glassy eyes locked onto the screen, sent a jolt of unease through me.\n\nMy stomach twisted. I stood there for a moment, caught in a strange, surreal stare-off with the doll. How was it even possible? My heart began to race as I took a hesitant step toward the living room, the quiet of the house pressing in around me. The doll didn\u2019t move, but I could have sworn that its eyes flicked toward me for just a second, before returning to the TV.\n\nI shook my head, dismissing the thought. But even as I moved closer, the feeling of being watched didn\u2019t fade. It felt like Randy knew something I didn\u2019t. Something was wrong.\n\nI glanced at the TV. A news anchor was talking about some mundane local story, but all I could focus on was the doll sitting there, like a person, as if it were part of the family. My mind raced, trying to make sense of the absurdity of the situation. This wasn\u2019t normal.\n\nI turned back to the kitchen, my thoughts spinning, and that's when I noticed the knife was gone. The counter was clean, nothing out of place\u2014but the missing knife only deepened my sense of dread. Had I put it away? Had Mary? Or had Randy moved it?\n\nMy chest tightened, and I swallowed hard, trying to steady my breathing. The house felt wrong\u2014too still, too empty, and somehow too aware of my every move. As I passed the living room again, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that the doll was no longer just a doll. It had become something else. Something that had a will, and it was watching me.\n\nThe news anchor's voice cut through the silence, and I froze in place, my heart pounding in my chest. The story that filled the screen was completely unexpected\u2014something I never thought I\u2019d hear, especially not now, in this house.\n\n\"\u2026A strange doll that has reportedly moved on its own at night, exhibiting violent behavior. A family of five claims the doll tried to kill them during the night, and they narrowly escaped with their lives. Authorities were called, but before they could arrive, the doll was returned to the store by one of the family members who complained. However, that individual was sent to a nearby mental institution for further evaluation. No criminal charges have been filed, but the family\u2019s bizarre story has left the community shaken. This incident occurred just two days ago, and authorities are still investigating the possibility of psychological or supernatural involvement.\"\n\nI stood there, frozen, as the news report continued to play in front of me. My breath caught in my throat. My mind raced, trying to process the words, the chilling implications. Was this really happening? Was this the doll? Could Randy really be connected to this?\n\nI blinked, unable to tear my eyes away from the screen. The images of the doll on the news matched the one sitting in my living room\u2014small, porcelain, with its glassy, lifeless eyes. My stomach churned. I thought I was imagining things when I saw it move earlier, but this? Hearing about the doll\u2019s violent behavior on TV made my skin crawl. I couldn\u2019t tell if it was the same doll or if my mind was just playing tricks on me.\n\nI felt my legs go weak, as if the floor was sinking beneath me. My eyes darted from the screen to Randy, who was still sitting on the couch, unblinking, like nothing had changed. But everything had changed. Was this some sort of sick joke? Was this the doll from the news? Or was I losing my mind, just like the person who had been sent to the mental institution?\n\nI wiped my face with my hands, trying to steady myself, but the words on the screen kept repeating in my head. \"\u2026A strange doll\u2026 violent behavior\u2026\" I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that something far darker than I could understand was going on, and it was staring right at me from the couch.\n\nI wanted to reach out, to shake the doll, to demand answers. But I didn\u2019t move. My mind was spinning, struggling to make sense of this nightmare. Was I imagining things, or was something truly wrong with Randy? Something that no one could explain.\n\nThe room was plunged into darkness as suddenly the lights and the power cut out, leaving me standing there in complete silence. My breath caught in my throat as I fumbled around for my phone, trying to light my way. But then, I saw it.\n\nIn the pitch black, I could make out the faintest outline of glowing red eyes, staring at the TV. I froze, my heart pounding in my chest. The doll, Randy, was no longer sitting innocently. Its eyes, now glowing a sinister red, slowly turned toward me. I could feel an icy chill crawl up my spine as its gaze locked onto mine, the air growing thick with an unsettling tension.\n\nAnd then, in the stillness of the dark, it spoke.\n\n\"Hi. I am Randy. Wanna play?\"\n\nA wave of terror crashed over me, and I didn\u2019t even think. I bolted for the door, my hands shaking as I twisted the handle and burst outside. My breath came in ragged gasps as I sprinted to my car. I fumbled with the keys, desperate to start the engine, my mind still reeling from what I had just seen. My hands were trembling as I punched in my wife\u2019s number, texting her urgently.\n\nThe power went out\u2026 and the doll started moving\u2026\n\nI didn\u2019t expect much, but the reply came almost immediately.\n\nYou\u2019re just imagining things. Calm down.\n\nI read her message and shook my head. I knew what I saw. It wasn\u2019t just my imagination\u2014this was real. My thoughts raced as I drove, my eyes flicking nervously to the rearview mirror, half-expecting to see that doll following me. I couldn\u2019t believe this was happening.\n\nWhen I arrived at my wife\u2019s place, I didn\u2019t waste time. I went straight inside, and without hesitation, I told my son we were getting rid of that doll. But my wife, looking unbothered as usual, objected immediately.\n\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re just imagining things. It\u2019s fine. The doll hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. Let it stay,\u201d she said, brushing me off with a wave.\n\nI snapped.\n\n\u201cThis doll literally told our son that he wants to kill us! It made him say a curse word\u2014a bad word\u2014and that\u2019s a terrible influence on our family! You know that!\u201d\n\nShe stopped, her face flickering with confusion, then a bit of doubt. But her hesitation was brief, replaced by the same dismissive attitude. \u201cIt\u2019s just a doll, John. You\u2019re overreacting.\u201d\n\nI could feel my blood pressure rising as I looked over at Randy, still sitting there, innocently perched on the couch, its eyes no longer glowing but still haunting in their emptiness. I knew, deep down, that whatever this doll was, it was more than just plastic. And the more I ignored it, the worse it was going to get. But for now, all I could do was stand there, helpless and frustrated, as my wife refused to believe what was happening right in front of us.\n\nThe park was eerily quiet for a late night, around 9:00 PM. The dim glow of the nearby streetlamps cast long shadows across the playground. A soft breeze rustled the leaves, but there was an unnatural stillness in the air, as if the whole world was holding its breath. My son was on the swing set, rocking back and forth slowly, his legs kicking lightly with each motion, the chain creaking in the silence. He was alone, lost in the world of his little game, as his mother\u2014Mary\u2014stood at the edge of the park, her gaze distant.\n\nI had just pulled up to the curb, the screech of my tires still echoing in my ears as I turned off the engine. My hands were shaking from the sheer adrenaline and fear of the events that had unfolded earlier. I needed to talk to Mary. I needed her to understand that the doll wasn\u2019t just a toy. It wasn\u2019t just an innocent part of our lives anymore.\n\nI grabbed the door handle and slammed it open. My boots hit the ground with a firm thud as I hurried toward her. The chill in the night air cut through my clothes, but it didn't matter. There was no turning back now.\n\n\u201cMary,\u201d I called out, trying to keep my voice steady, but my words broke through with an edge of desperation. \"We need to talk. You can\u2019t just ignore this. The doll\u2014Randy\u2014it's dangerous. It\u2019s not normal, Mary! I saw it with my own eyes. I saw its eyes turn red. I saw it move. The power shut out. Something\u2019s wrong with it! And his eyes weren't supposed to go red. Even if they did, why were they red? That's weird, right?!\"\n\nShe didn\u2019t turn to face me right away, her attention still on our son, but her shoulders stiffened when she heard the urgency in my voice. Slowly, she faced me, her eyes hard but weary, as though she had already decided what she wanted to say.\n\n\"John,\" she said quietly, her voice low, almost resigned. \"I told you already. You're overthinking this. It's just a doll. We can talk about it when you're thinking more clearly. Right now, I\u2019m just trying to keep things normal for our son.\"\n\nI felt my frustration rising again. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a doll, Mary! You\u2019re not hearing me! This thing spoke to our son. It told him things it shouldn\u2019t even know. It told him it would kill us. It knew things. I saw it on the news\u2014it\u2019s haunted, Mary! Something is seriously wrong with it!\u201d\n\nShe crossed her arms, sighing, her expression unreadable. \u201cJohn, you're tired. You\u2019ve been under a lot of stress lately. We need to go home, get some rest. We\u2019ll talk about this when you're calmer. Right now, we need to focus on our son. It\u2019s just a toy, nothing more.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing. How could she dismiss this? How could she be so calm?\n\n\"No,\" I snapped, my voice rising with the weight of everything I had seen. \"I\u2019m going with you. You're not going back with that doll alone. I don't care if you think I\u2019m crazy. You're not going back there with that thing.\u201d\n\nMary\u2019s face tightened with frustration. \u201cJohn, please,\u201d she said, the quiet desperation in her tone cutting through my resolve. \"We are going home. We are not going to have this argument tonight.\"\n\nI stood my ground, unwavering. \u201cI\u2019m not staying here, Mary. I\u2019m going with you, and I\u2019m taking that damn doll with me, even if it means dragging it out of there myself.\u201d\n\nHer gaze softened, but it didn't show any sign of yielding. Without another word, she turned toward the car. I felt a brief pang of regret, but it was quickly replaced with determination. There was no way I was letting her go back alone with that thing.\n\nWe both got in our own cars and headed back to the house, the silence between us thick, each of us lost in our own thoughts. The drive back seemed longer than usual, the streets darker, and my nerves only heightened with each passing mile.\n\nWhen we arrived back at the house, the air was thick with tension. As we stepped inside, I could feel it. The house was silent. Too silent. My eyes darted around, scanning for anything that seemed out of place. There was nothing. But that feeling\u2026 that feeling wouldn\u2019t leave.\n\nMary grabbed our son by the hand and led him through the house, toward his room. I stayed behind, standing in the hallway with a sinking feeling in my stomach. The atmosphere in the house felt heavy\u2014something was off. Something was wrong.\n\nAs I stepped into the room, I saw it immediately.\n\nThere, sitting on the bed in the center of the room, was Randy. The doll. Its eyes stared back at me with that same eerie, lifeless gaze. But there was something new, something worse. A piece of paper rested next to the doll.\n\nMary stepped forward, her eyes flickering over the note with a frown. She bent down and picked it up, then held it out to me. \"Did you write this, son?\" she asked, her voice calm but tinged with confusion.\n\nMy son shook his head, his eyes wide with innocence. \"No, Mom, I didn\u2019t do it. The doll did it.\"\n\nMy heart skipped a beat. The doll\u2026 it wrote this? My blood ran cold as I looked at Mary. \"See? I told you something\u2019s wrong with it! It\u2019s not just in my head.\"\n\nBut Mary, always the optimist, shook her head and smiled softly. \"No, John. This is just our son using his imagination. It\u2019s a game to him. He\u2019s been playing with it, and now it\u2019s come to life in his mind. That\u2019s all.\"\n\nI stared at her, a sense of helplessness washing over me. \"Mary\u2026 this is real. It\u2019s not just his imagination. This doll\u2014\"\n\n\"John,\" she interrupted gently. \"You\u2019re letting this all get to you. We should just play along with him, okay? It\u2019s just a game. Nothing more.\"\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing. How could she think this was just a game? But Mary didn\u2019t seem to see it the way I did. She was calm. She was already accepting it, and that made the dread in my chest even worse.\n\nThe doll wasn\u2019t just a doll. It was something darker. But Mary wasn\u2019t ready to see that.\n\nThe doll sat on the table, its blue eyes staring blankly ahead. Our son, with his small hands, pressed the button on its back, and immediately the eerie mechanical voice began counting down.\n\n\u201c10... 9... 8\u2026\u201d\n\nMary and I exchanged a glance, both of us unsure of what was happening. My mind raced, but I couldn't tear my eyes away from the doll. How was it counting? Why was it doing this?\n\nOur son stood there, transfixed, watching the doll count as it continued.\n\n\u201c7... 6... 5\u2026\u201d\n\nI felt a cold shiver crawl up my spine, but I didn't move. I couldn\u2019t. This was unreal, yet here it was, happening in front of me. It felt like I was watching a nightmare unfold in slow motion.\n\n\"4... 3...\" the doll\u2019s mechanical voice droned on.\n\nI turned to Mary. \u201cWe need to hide.\u201d\n\nWithout another word, we both turned and sprinted toward the hallway, our footsteps echoing in the silence. The house, usually so familiar, now felt foreign and oppressive.\n\nI didn\u2019t know where to go\u2014just that I needed to get away from the doll. I glanced around quickly and pulled Mary into the small closet under the stairs. It was cramped, but it was the only place I could think of. We crouched down together in the dark, my breath quick and shallow as we listened to the sound of the countdown continuing.\n\n\u201c2... 1\u2026\u201d\n\nPart 2: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/StoryLord444\/s\/FdahoikCvQ"},"27":{"title":"The Chinese Feet Tickler","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1jh588w\/the_chinese_feet_tickler\/","flair":"Story","author":"RIP_Harambe2012","selftext":"\nIn a dark and lonely apartment, a sinister presence lurks. The walls seem to close in, shadows dance in the corners, and the air grows thick with an unsettling tension. This is the domain of the Chinese Feet Tickler, a devious entity that thrives on the fear and vulnerability of its prey.\n\nCharacter Background: Once a simple man named Wei, he lived in a small village in China, where he was known for his seemingly innocent yet unsettling obsession with feet. As a child, he was fascinated by the way people reacted to being tickled, viewing it as a form of power. After a tragic accident that claimed his life, his spirit became tethered to the mortal realm, twisting his obsession into a malevolent urge. He now manifests in dark spaces, drawn to those who are most vulnerable\u2014those who are asleep.\n\nThe Encounter: One fateful night, you find yourself alone in your dimly lit apartment, the silence so profound it feels suffocating. You drift into a deep sleep, but as the clock ticks into the witching hour, an icy chill seeps into the room. You awaken suddenly, heart pounding, only to feel a feather-light touch against your feet.\n\nAt first, it\u2019s just a tickle, a playful brush against your skin. But as you stir, sleep still clouding your mind, the sensation intensifies. You try to pull away, but something unseen holds you captive.\n\n\u201cAwake yet?\u201d a whisper teases from the shadows, the voice smooth and serpentine. The Chinese Feet Tickler revels in the fear he instills, his intentions anything but playful.\n\nThe Horror Unfolds: With each stroke of his spectral fingers, you feel the laughter of a thousand souls echoing through the apartment. You realize that this is no mere tickling; it\u2019s a torment designed to elicit screams that will never escape your lips. The more you struggle, the more he delights in your helplessness.\n\nYour mind races with thoughts of escape, but as you attempt to sit up, the oppressive weight of the darkness pushes you back down. You can see his form now, a shadowy figure with elongated fingers, each one tipped with an icy claw designed to dig into your very essence.\n\n\u201cJust a little longer\u2026\u201d he croons, enjoying your panic. \u201cYou\u2019ll find that fear is the sweetest of all.\u201d\n\nThe Final Chill: As dawn approaches, the darkness begins to recede, but the Chinese Feet Tickler\u2019s grip remains strong. He leans closer, his breath cold against your skin, and whispers, \u201cUntil next time\u2026\u201d\n\nWith a final surge of energy, you manage to break free, bolting upright, breathless and drenched in sweat. But as you look around, the apartment is empty, the shadows retreating into the corners, and yet the feeling of being watched persists.\n\nYou can never be sure if it was just a dream or if he is still lurking in the depths of your mind, waiting for the next chance to strike. The fear lingers, a chilling reminder that while the night may have passed, the Chinese Feet Tickler is never truly gone."},"28":{"title":"The Smile Man","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1jgp2rl\/the_smile_man\/","flair":"Story","author":"StoryLord444","selftext":"The road stretched endlessly ahead, the headlights carving a narrow tunnel through the night. My hands rested firmly on the steering wheel, my thumbs tapping absentmindedly to the soft hum of the radio. The world outside was quiet - too quiet - with only the occasional flicker of trees rushing past. I hadn't seen another car for miles.\n\nThis was supposed to be good for us. A weekend away from everything - the noise, the routines, the lingering weight of Sarah's absence. She wasn't gone, of course. Just away for the weekend, out with friends, laughing, unwinding. She deserved that. I told her to go, to enjoy herself. I could handle things. A camping trip with the kids sounded perfect. Fresh air, s'mores, a crackling fire under the stars. Yeah. We needed this.\n\nEmily was excited, bouncing in her seat even before we left the driveway, her tiny legs swinging. Ryan... well, Ryan didn't complain. That was something. He missed his mom, even if he wouldn't say it. I felt it in the way he stared out the window, quiet and distant. Maybe this trip would bring us together again - a chance to feel like a family.\n\nThe clock on the dash glowed 9:42 PM. The highway had long since faded into winding backroads, the kind where the trees leaned in too close, branches clawing at the edges of the light. The stars barely peeked through the dense canopy above.\n\nI glanced in the rearview mirror, seeing Emily's head bobbing as she fought off sleep. Ryan sat on the opposite side, his hoodie pulled up, eyes lost somewhere in the dark woods outside.\n\nYeah. This was going to be good. We just needed to get there.\n\n\"Alright, who's ready for an adventure?\" I said, forcing my voice to sound lighter than I felt.\n\nEmily stirred, mumbling something too soft to hear. Ryan didn't answer. He hadn't said much the whole trip.\n\nI sighed, shifting in my seat - and that's when I saw it.\n\nA flicker of light appeared between the trees, too bright, too steady to be a firefly. It hovered, unnaturally still, just beyond the treeline.\n\nI blinked, narrowing my eyes. A lantern? Headlights from another car? No... we were in the middle of nowhere. No houses for miles.\n\nThe light moved. Not flickering, not swaying - but gliding smoothly alongside the car, keeping pace.\n\nMy stomach tightened. My fingers curled tighter around the wheel. It wasn't a light. Not really.\n\nIt stretched, curving into something thin and sharp - something that looked like teeth.\n\nA smile.\n\nAnd it was watching us.\n\nI kept my eyes on the road, trying to shake off that feeling in my gut. Whatever it was, I knew it wasn't right. But I couldn't dwell on it. We had made it this far, and the kids needed this trip. It was a fresh start for all of us, even if it was just for the weekend.\n\nEventually, the winding road opened up to a wider stretch of land, and I could see the wooden sign up ahead.\n\n\"Cedarwood Forest Campground\" it read, the letters weathered but still visible. A familiar relief washed over me. We'd made it.\n\nI pulled the car to a slow stop in front of a small wooden kiosk, where a uniformed officer sat in a folding chair, a clipboard resting in his lap. His eyes were sharp under the brim of his hat, taking in the car and its passengers as I rolled down the window.\n\n\"Evening,\" I said, trying to sound cheerful. \"We're here to camp for the weekend.\"\n\nThe officer gave me a quick nod, his gaze flicking over to the kids in the backseat, then back to me. \"$30 for the weekend, sir,\" he said, his voice firm but polite. \"It's a cash-only campground, but we've got a nice spot right by the lake. You'll find the parking area just ahead. Just follow the signs to the campgrounds. Enjoy your stay.\"\n\nI pulled out my wallet and handed over the cash, feeling the weight of the night press in on me. The officer gave me a receipt, waved me through, and I rolled up the window, steering the car past the parking area.\n\nThe parking lot wasn't huge - just a few rows of gravel spaces, each marked with a small, weathered sign indicating the camp sites. There were a few other cars parked, mostly older models with gear strapped to the roofs, tents and coolers already packed beside them.\n\nI parked the car in an empty spot, the headlights illuminating the darkened woods ahead. The air felt crisp, the scent of pine trees filling the space around us.\n\n\"Alright, guys,\" I said, cutting the engine. \"We're here. Let's get everything out and set up before it gets too dark.\"\n\nEmily's eyes lit up as she unbuckled her seatbelt, her excitement palpable. \"Yay! I get to sleep in a tent!\" She shot out of the car before I even had the chance to grab the keys.\n\nRyan didn't say anything at first, but I could see him trying to hide his grin, his green eyes reflecting the excitement. He wasn't one to show too much emotion, but I knew he was looking forward to this trip more than he let on.\n\n\"Come on, Ryan, let's get the tents set up,\" I said, opening the trunk to grab the gear.\n\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" he muttered, but I could hear the enthusiasm behind it.\n\nThe campsite was peaceful - the gentle rustle of the trees above, the faint sounds of distant wildlife. It was nothing like the city noise we were used to. The kids were in their element, running around and laughing, their voices carrying in the cool night air.\n\nWe managed to get the first tent set up quickly. Ryan and I worked together, sliding the poles into place, while Emily helped by passing the stakes. She was already talking about what she was going to do the next day - what trail she wanted to hike, what animals she might see. I smiled, tying down the last corner of the tent.\n\n\"There we go. One tent, all set up,\" I said, wiping my hands on my jeans. I looked at Emily, then Ryan. They were both grinning, happy, for once completely lost in the joy of being outdoors.\n\n\"Can I help make the fire?\" Emily asked, her hands clasped together. \"I wanna roast marshmallows!\"\n\nRyan rolled his eyes playfully but nodded. \"Yeah, sure, kid. We'll make the best fire ever.\"\n\nI chuckled, starting to feel that sense of relief creeping in. Maybe, just maybe, this would be the escape we needed. It felt like we were finally beginning to unwind, to shake off everything that had been weighing us down.\n\nI stepped back to look at the tents, my kids already making themselves at home in the small space. The night stretched on, and the stars above shimmered brightly, untouched by city lights. A small, satisfying sense of peace settled over me.\n\n\"Let's get the fire going,\" I said, as I gathered the wood from the pile nearby. \"We'll make this a night to remember.\"\n\nAnd for a while, it felt like everything was exactly as it should be.\n\nThe night was quiet, save for the occasional crackle of wood as I arranged the logs into the firepit. The kids were chattering away, gathering sticks and small pieces of kindling to help me get the fire going. Ryan was a little more hesitant with the matches, but Emily was practically bouncing, too eager to wait.\n\nI struck the match and held it to the dry kindling. The flames caught quickly, and soon the fire was crackling, casting flickering shadows across our small campsite. The warmth from the fire felt good, especially after the chill of the night air. Emily was already holding out her marshmallow stick, her face lit up by the orange glow of the flames.\n\n\"I'm gonna roast the perfect marshmallow!\" she declared, her voice filled with determination.\n\nI laughed. \"You say that every time, Em. Let's see if you can actually pull it off tonight.\"\n\nRyan didn't say anything but smirked, pulling out his own stick and skewering a marshmallow. He wasn't one for talking much, but I could see the peace settling in him too.\n\nWe sat there for a while, the fire's warmth and the quiet of the forest surrounding us. The sound of the crackling fire and the occasional rustle of the trees above were oddly comforting. For a while, everything felt perfect. No distractions, no city noise. Just us. The kind of peaceful moment I had been longing for.\n\nBut then something shifted in the air, a feeling I couldn't quite place. The firelight flickered, casting longer shadows than it should have, and suddenly, I had the eerie sense that we weren't alone.\n\nI looked up, my gaze automatically drawn to the edge of the clearing where the trees started to grow thicker. At first, it was just the blackness of the woods, an impenetrable mass of shadows. But then - I saw it.\n\nA figure. It was far away, standing just at the edge of the forest, barely visible in the distance. But the thing that struck me first was its smile. It was too bright. Too wide. It shone through the darkness like it was carved from light itself, cutting through the night like a cruel, mocking mockery of joy.\n\nIts eyes, bright and unnaturally white, seemed to pierce through the distance. I could see everything - its grin, its eyes - but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't make out the shape of the creature. It was like the shadows themselves were swallowing up the figure, distorting it beyond recognition.\n\nMy breath caught in my throat, and I blinked hard, trying to make sense of it. Was it real? Was it my mind playing tricks on me?\n\nThe figure didn't move, just stood there, grinning. I blinked again, and in that instant, it vanished. The clearing was empty once more, the only sound the crackling of the fire.\n\nI shook my head, telling myself it was nothing. Just the dark woods playing tricks on me. But the unease still clung to me like a second skin. I forced myself to focus back on the fire, to focus on the kids.\n\n\"Everything alright?\" Ryan asked, his voice sharp as if he sensed the sudden shift in my mood.\n\n\"Yeah, just... got a little distracted,\" I muttered, trying to shake the feeling off. \"Nothing to worry about.\"\n\nBut I couldn't ignore the knot that had formed in my stomach. The image of that smile, that unnatural grin, lingered in the back of my mind. I shook my head again, forcing myself to focus on the present.\n\nEmily was happily toasting her marshmallow, oblivious to the tension that had settled into the air. Ryan, too, seemed fine, poking at the fire with a stick, his expression as casual as ever.\n\nBut even though the firelight was warm, I couldn't shake the chill that had crawled up my spine.\n\nWe stayed out there for a while longer, trying to enjoy the moment. But the air felt heavier now, the shadows deeper. The distant woods, once welcoming, now felt suffocating.\n\n\"Alright, guys,\" I said, my voice more clipped than I intended. \"Let's finish up and head inside the tents. We don't want to be out here too late.\"\n\nEmily pouted but nodded, reluctantly pulling her marshmallow away from the fire. \"Fine, Daddy. I'll save the rest for tomorrow.\"\n\nRyan followed suit, tossing his half-eaten marshmallow onto the ground with a flick of his wrist.\n\nWe doused the fire, stamping out the last of the embers, the air cooling immediately. The night was darker now, the sky overhead almost suffocating in its blackness.\n\n\"Come on, guys,\" I said again, more urgently this time, my unease growing stronger. \"Let's get inside the tents.\"\n\nWe grabbed our things and hurried toward the tents, a palpable tension in the air. I could still feel that strange, unsettling sensation clinging to me, like something wasn't right. But we made it to the tents, the zippered flaps a welcome barrier between us and the vast, empty woods outside.\n\nAs I tucked Emily into her sleeping bag and Ryan settled into his, the tent felt too small, too closed in. I couldn't shake the feeling that something was out there, something that wasn't meant to be seen, something that was waiting.\n\n\"Good night, kids,\" I said, forcing a smile, but even my voice didn't sound as convincing as I wanted it to.\n\n\"Good night, Dad,\" Ryan mumbled, his voice already half-lost to sleep.\n\n\"Night, Daddy,\" Emily whispered, her eyes already fluttering closed.\n\nI lay there in the dark, the sounds of the forest all around us. But I couldn't sleep. Every creak, every rustle of the trees made my heart race, and my mind kept replaying the image of that smile, that unnaturally bright grin.\n\nSomewhere, in the distance, I knew it was still there, waiting.\n\nThe morning light seeped into the tent through the small cracks in the fabric, casting soft beams across the ground. I woke up first, before the kids. My eyes fluttered open, and for a moment, I just lay there, listening to the stillness of the woods around us. The air was cool but not cold, the kind of morning where you could breathe deep and feel a crisp freshness in your lungs.\n\nEmily was curled up in her sleeping bag, her soft blonde hair falling in waves over the pillow. Her breathing was steady, and I could hear the occasional soft sigh escape her lips. Ryan, too, was still asleep, his sandy hair tousled and his freckled face peaceful in a way that made me smile.\n\nI didn't want to wake them up. Instead, I just lay there for a while, watching them, feeling this odd sense of contentment. But there was something else - something I couldn't quite shake. A creeping sense of unease, like a shadow lingering in the back of my mind, whispering that something wasn't quite right.\n\nI rubbed my face with one hand, trying to shake the fogginess from my brain. The weird feeling I had last night still clung to me like a thick fog. That smile. The eyes. The feeling that I wasn't alone out here, even though there was no one around.\n\nI shifted slightly, trying not to wake the kids, and pushed the thought away. I didn't want to overthink it. It was probably just the isolation, the woods playing tricks on my mind. The quietness of everything. I had to snap out of it.\n\nI slowly unzipped the flap of the tent and stepped out, the cool morning air hitting me as I stood up. I looked out over the clearing, at the small patch of woods beyond. The fog from the night had lifted, but the trees still loomed ominously, their dark shapes reaching up toward the sky. The fire pit from last night was nothing but a pile of ash now, and the camp seemed even quieter than before.\n\nI bent down to pick up a stray stick, my hands moving mechanically. As I straightened up, I glanced back at the tent. The kids were still asleep. They looked so peaceful, like nothing could ever hurt them. And that was the thing that made me feel... off. How could something that peaceful and perfect exist in the middle of such a strange, unsettling place?\n\nI tried to shake it off again, focusing on the present. I leaned against a nearby tree, my fingers tracing the rough bark as I stared into the distance. But then, just like the night before, that nagging feeling returned. The words I'd said yesterday, while driving - how everything was fine, how the trip was going great, how the kids were excited - it didn't sit right. My voice still echoed in my mind, and it felt... rehearsed. Like something I had said before. Over and over again. But I couldn't remember when.\n\nI let out a quiet sigh and turned back toward the tent. The kids were still asleep. I almost wanted to let them sleep in, give them the extra time to rest before we started the day. But a part of me couldn't shake the thought that something was wrong. Something beyond the usual fatherly concerns. Something deeper. Something I couldn't explain.\n\nAs I stood there, lost in thought, I found myself staring at the trees once more. The woods were still and silent, as though holding their breath. I couldn't help but feel that at any moment, something was going to break the stillness. The woods were alive, yes, but there was something unnatural about it. It wasn't the peaceful kind of alive. It was a quiet, waiting kind of alive.\n\nMy hand twitched, and I realized I had been standing there too long. I needed to focus on the kids. On the trip. I was their dad. I was supposed to be their protector. I couldn't let my mind wander like this.\n\nI took one last deep breath and started to head back toward the tent, but then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw it - a flicker. Something moving in the distance. The trees shifted, but it wasn't wind. I stopped dead in my tracks. For just a second, I thought I saw a figure - a shape, just at the edge of my vision.\n\nI blinked quickly, but it was gone.\n\nI rubbed my eyes. What was going on with me? Maybe it was just the fog of sleep or the strange feeling that had been hanging over me since last night. But that wasn't the point. The point was... something wasn't right.\n\nI shook my head and walked back to the tent, trying to clear my thoughts. When I unzipped the door and crawled inside, the smell of damp earth and fabric hit me. The kids were still sound asleep. Emily's soft snores filled the quiet space, and Ryan's face was buried in the pillow, his body curled up like a little ball.\n\nI sat on the ground next to them, staring at their peaceful faces. I couldn't help but smile at how innocent they looked. But the smile didn't reach my eyes. I could feel the weight of something pressing on me, something I couldn't explain.\n\nI wanted to say something, to shake the feeling off, but instead, I just sat there. Watching. Waiting. Trying to ignore the nagging voice in my head telling me that something was wrong. That I had missed something. That my words from yesterday, the driving, the laughter, everything - they didn't belong.\n\nI wasn't sure what I was doing anymore. But I couldn't leave. I couldn't shake the idea that something was watching us, waiting for us to make the next move.\n\nI just hoped I was wrong.\n\nThe sun was already high in the sky when I finally made my way back into the tent. The kids were still sound asleep, curled up together like they didn't have a care in the world. I smiled at the sight - how innocent they looked. How easy it seemed for them to just slip into peaceful dreams.\n\nI stretched my arms overhead, feeling the crisp morning air through the fabric of the tent. It was time to start the day. I didn't want to rush them, but I also wanted to make the most of the trip. I crouched down beside Emily, gently brushing a few stray hairs from her face.\n\n\"Hey, princess,\" I whispered, my voice soft but firm enough to rouse her from her sleep. \"Time to wake up.\"\n\nEmily stirred, blinking her bright blue eyes as she slowly woke up. A small smile spread across her face when she saw me. \"Morning, Daddy,\" she mumbled, her voice still thick with sleep.\n\nRyan was harder to wake. His messy brown hair was tangled in a way that made him look even younger than his ten years. I nudged him, shaking him gently by the shoulder. \"Hey, bud, time to get up.\"\n\nHe groaned, rubbing his eyes with the back of his hand. \"Do we have to?\"\n\nI chuckled softly. \"Yeah, we have to. But guess what? We've got a whole day ahead of us. We're gonna have fun today.\"\n\nThat seemed to do the trick. Ryan let out a half-yawn, half-laugh, and sat up, rubbing his eyes. \"What are we doing?\"\n\nI grinned, already knowing what I wanted to do next. \"How about a game of hide and seek?\" I suggested, my voice carrying an excitement I hoped they would catch.\n\nEmily jumped up instantly. \"Yes! Let's do it! Can I hide first?\"\n\nRyan nodded enthusiastically. \"I'll find you, Emily. You'll never get away from me!\"\n\nI laughed, shaking my head. \"Alright, alright. Let's get outside. We'll start fresh in the woods.\"\n\nWe crawled out of the tent and into the cool morning air. The woods stretched out before us, vast and inviting. The trees were thick, and I knew the kids would have a blast running around, playing their games in the open space.\n\n\"Okay, Emily, you're up first,\" I said. \"You hide, and Ryan and I will count.\"\n\nEmily didn't hesitate. She darted off, already trying to find the perfect hiding spot, her blonde hair bouncing behind her. Ryan counted loudly, his voice echoing through the woods.\n\n\"One... two... three...\"\n\nI grinned as Emily disappeared behind a large tree, her giggle barely audible. Ryan and I exchanged a look, both of us trying to stifle our laughter as we began to search for her.\n\nThe day was filled with games - tag, racing, and more hide and seek. The kids were full of energy, laughing and shouting as they ran through the woods, their voices carrying through the air. The sounds of their joy made the woods feel less foreboding, less strange. For a while, I could almost forget the nagging feeling I'd had earlier.\n\nBy the time the sun started to dip beneath the trees, we were all worn out, our faces flushed from running around. I led them back to the campfire, where we settled down and made our dinner - simple hot dogs and marshmallows roasted over the fire. The smell of sizzling food mixed with the fresh scent of the woods, and for a moment, everything felt normal.\n\nAfter dinner, we all sat around the fire, the flames crackling and dancing in the night air. The sky was clear, the stars twinkling above, and the moon hung low, casting an eerie glow over the camp. The kids looked content, tired but happy, their eyes wide as they gazed into the fire.\n\n\"Alright,\" I said, wiping my hands on my pants. \"It's getting late. Time to get ready for bed.\"\n\nEmily groaned but nodded. \"Do we have to?\"\n\nI nodded. \"We'll have another fun day tomorrow, but it's important to get some sleep.\"\n\nWe got everything settled, the tent zipped up for the night, and the kids snuggled into their sleeping bags. They were both still full of energy, their excitement from the day not quite ready to fade.\n\n\"Can you tell us a bedtime story, Daddy?\" Emily asked, her voice soft but hopeful.\n\nRyan nodded, his eyes already starting to droop. \"Please, Dad.\"\n\nI chuckled, sitting down on the edge of their sleeping bags. I had a lot of stories to choose from, but something about this moment felt right for an old classic. \"Alright, how about Romeo and Juliet?\" I said.\n\nThey both perked up, intrigued by the idea of a love story. I wasn't sure if they fully understood the depth of it, but I figured it might be fun to share.\n\n\"Once upon a time,\" I began, my voice lowering to a soothing tone, \"there were two families, the Montagues and the Capulets. They hated each other, like, really hated each other. And then, one night, at a big party, two of their children, Romeo and Juliet, met.\"\n\nI could see their faces light up as I began the tale. I told them the story of forbidden love, of how Romeo and Juliet fell for each other at first sight, their love defying the long-standing feud between their families. I skipped over the darker parts, the tragedy of the ending, but focused on the pure connection between the two.\n\n\"Romeo and Juliet couldn't be together,\" I said, my voice heavy with emotion. \"But they still fought for their love. They tried to make it work, even when the world didn't want them to. And even though they didn't get the happy ending they deserved, their love was remembered for all time.\"\n\nAs I finished the story, I looked down at Emily and Ryan. They were both asleep, their faces peaceful, their bodies curled into their sleeping bags. I smiled softly, tucking the blanket tighter around them.\n\nI glanced toward the entrance of the tent, my thoughts drifting again to the woods outside. The feeling of being watched - of something lurking just beyond the trees - crept back into my mind. But I pushed it aside, focusing on the warmth of the fire and the peaceful breaths of my children.\n\nI had to believe everything was fine. I had to.\n\nI woke up in the middle of the night, my body stiff with tension, my eyes snapping open as I heard it-the sound that didn't belong. At first, I couldn't place it. A low whale, distant but unmistakable. It wasn't the usual wildlife noises of the forest. It was a long, drawn-out sound, almost animalistic, but there was something off about it. It didn't belong here. It seemed to pierce through the silence, eerie and unnatural. A second wheal joined the first, then another, until they all merged into a horrible, rhythmic cacophony. The more I heard it, the more it felt like a warning. Like the creatures of the forest were trying to tell me something.\n\nThe noise was growing louder, more frantic, as if something was moving, something large, something that didn't belong. A chill ran down my spine, and I instinctively pulled the blanket tighter around me, my heart pounding in my chest.\n\nSuddenly, a gust of wind howled through the trees, shaking the tent, making the branches creak as though something was forcing its way through the woods. The whale noises stopped for a brief moment, leaving only the whisper of the wind, but the eerie quiet that followed was worse. It was as though everything had gone still, waiting.\n\nI slowly sat up, trying to calm my breathing, but my skin prickled with a strange, cold sweat. There was something outside, something that made the forest feel wrong, something that was lurking just beyond the shadows. And then, in the silence that followed, I heard the sound again-a wheal, sharper this time, closer, almost as if it was coming from right outside my tent.\n\nMy body tensed. I wasn't sure whether it was my imagination running wild or if something truly was out there, but I couldn't shake the feeling that whatever it was, it was watching me, waiting for the right moment to make itself known.\n\nI lay there in the dark, my mind racing. The strange whale sounds from outside seemed to echo through my skull, and every time they paused, I felt as though something was getting closer. It felt like the entire forest was holding its breath, waiting for something terrible to happen.\n\nWith my heart pounding, I slowly reached for the zipper of the tent. My fingers trembled as I unzipped it just a bit, trying not to make any noise. I peered out into the blackness. At first, I saw nothing. But then, something caught my eye in the corner of my vision-something tall, something... unnatural.\n\nA towering figure, standing just beyond the reach of the firelight. It was massive, easily twelve feet tall, its form a void of pure darkness. It absorbed all the light around it, making the air around it feel colder, heavier. Its body was featureless, a silhouette that seemed to bend and stretch in the shadows. The creature's arms hung unnaturally low, down to its knees, and its fingers... they were twisted, gnarled, like broken branches of some ancient tree. Its hair was blacker than the night itself, so dark it seemed to suck in the light around it.\n\nBut the worst part wasn't its size or its form. No, it was the eyes. Those eyes-stark white sclera with pitch-black pupils-locked onto mine, and I felt a shiver run through me that had nothing to do with the cold. It was the smile. The grin. It was impossibly bright, glowing in the dark like a cruel mockery of light. It sliced through the night, too wide, too bright, and it never wavered.\n\nThe creature just stood there, its head tilted slightly as it stared at me, its grin never faltering. It wasn't moving, just watching. I could feel my heart racing in my chest, my throat closing up. Fear crawled up my spine, cold and unrelenting.\n\nI snapped the zipper shut, nearly panicking as I quickly backed away from the tent opening. My breath came in shallow gasps, my body trembling with adrenaline. I could feel a sense of terror rising in me, like I was suffocating. I glanced over at my kids-Emily and Ryan-still sound asleep in their sleeping bags, oblivious to the nightmare outside. How could they not sense it? How could they sleep through this?\n\nI forced myself to calm down, but my mind was screaming. I had to get us out of here. I had to leave. But I couldn't think straight. Not yet. I needed to wake them, get them moving.\n\n\"Hey, hey, kids. Wake up. We need to go. It's time to leave,\" I whispered urgently, my voice hoarse.\n\nEmily stirred first, blinking sleepily at me, her expression confused. \"Dad? What's going on? Why are we leaving?\"\n\nRyan groggily sat up, rubbing his eyes. \"What happened, Dad? Why do we have to go?\"\n\nI forced a smile, even though my stomach was tied in knots. \"There's been a change of plans. It's time to head home. We need to leave now, okay?\" I said, trying to sound normal, but I knew I was failing. My voice was too sharp, too panicked.\n\nEmily tilted her head, eyes narrowing slightly as she studied me. \"Dad, why do you look so scared?\"\n\nI froze, not knowing how to answer her. My heart was pounding too hard in my chest, my thoughts spinning too fast. I couldn't even bring myself to tell her the truth.\n\nInstead, I reached for the zipper again, my hands trembling. I unzipped it just a bit, just enough to peek outside.\n\nAnd it was gone. The creature was no longer there.\n\nI shoved my shoes on, fumbling with the laces as I tied them tightly. \"Hurry up, kids!\" I called. They quickly bent down, hands smoothing the laces, each pair aligned with careful precision as they slipped their shoes on without a word.\n\nBut I didn't wait. I didn't hesitate. My heart leaped into my throat, and I grabbed the kids, pulling them to their feet. \"Come on, we're leaving, now,\" I said, my voice trembling. I didn't care that everything was still packed up, that we hadn't finished everything. All I knew was that we had to go, and we had to go fast.\n\nThe moment I zipped the tent closed behind us, I led them into the night, not daring to look back. I didn't care what was left behind. I didn't care about anything but getting us out of the woods, away from whatever was out there watching us.\n\nThe air felt thick with dread, like the forest itself was holding us in its grip, unwilling to let go. The silence was deafening as I urged my kids forward, my own fear gnawing at me, pushing me to move faster. Something was still out there. Something that wanted to hurt us.\n\nAnd I had to get us to safety before it found us again.\n\nAs we ran, the strange noises intensified. At first, it was just the wind rustling through the trees, but then came the sounds-the eerie, unnatural sounds. It was as if the entire forest had come alive. Dogs barking, sharp and frantic, pierced the air. But then, it wasn't just dogs. Birds began to shriek and chirp, their calls frantic, overlapping with the barking. Owls hooted in the distance, their voices echoing through the woods, but it wasn't normal. It was all happening at once, in a chaotic symphony of animal sounds, and each noise seemed to be getting closer. Closer. As if something-or someone-was chasing us through the dark.\n\nI could feel the tension in the air, thick and suffocating, as I pushed the kids forward. They stumbled behind me, their legs tired, but I couldn't slow down. We had to keep moving.\n\nI was focusing on the ground, watching every step, dodging roots and rocks, my feet pounding against the uneven terrain. The trees blurred past me in the dark, their gnarled branches reaching out like claws, but I didn't have time to look up. I had to keep my eyes trained on the path, on where my feet landed.\n\n\"Stay close!\" I shouted over my shoulder, trying to keep my voice steady, but it came out sharp, panicked.\n\nEmily and Ryan were right behind me, but I could hear them breathing heavily, their feet slapping against the forest floor, trying to match my pace. I heard Ryan trip, his feet catching on something, but he managed to keep his balance. \"Come on!\" I urged, not daring to turn around.\n\nThe animal noises were getting louder, closer. The barking sounded like it was directly behind us, the yelps echoing in the stillness of the night. And then there was the flurry of bird calls-more intense now, frantic, desperate-like they were being hunted, too. The wind seemed to pick up, whistling through the trees, and every branch seemed to snap underfoot as I raced past them.\n\n\"Faster!\" I urged, my own breath coming in ragged gasps. I could hear my heart thundering in my chest, and the fear was suffocating. It wasn't just the animals. It was the feeling. The unmistakable sense that we were being watched. That something-or someone-was trailing us, just out of sight, but closing in with every passing second.\n\nThe path was narrowing now, and I had to duck under branches and dodge low-hanging limbs. The forest around me was alive with the sounds of chaos-dogs barking, birds screeching, owls hooting. It was all blending together into a maddening cacophony that seemed to follow us, pulling us deeper into the woods.\n\nI glanced back once-just a quick glance-and saw nothing but darkness. But I could feel it. Something was out there, something chasing us.\n\nI could hear the kids breathing hard now, Emily's voice trembling. \"Dad, what's happening? Why are we running?\"\n\nI didn't have an answer. I couldn't even form a coherent thought. I just knew that we had to keep going. We couldn't stop. We couldn't look back.\n\nEvery step felt like it was taking us farther from safety. But the noise, the unnerving chaos of the forest... it was closing in. It was as if the entire world was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.\n\nBut all I could do was run. Run, and keep running.\n\nWe stumbled out of the woods, breathless and panicked, crashing through the underbrush, desperate to find any kind of safety. And there it was-the familiar building. The one where we had paid to get into the woods, where we had seen the security guard earlier. It loomed in the distance, the light from a single overhead lamp flickering in the haze of the night.\n\nWe rushed toward it, and as we neared the entrance, I saw the security guard sitting in his chair, his feet kicked up on the desk. He was still there, calm, unaware of the terror that had been stalking us.\n\nI could barely catch my breath, my chest tight with panic as I approached him. \"You've got to help us! Something's out there-something wrong,\" I shouted, my voice cracking with fear.\n\nThe security guard looked up slowly, his expression unchanging. He didn't move for a moment, just stared at me as though I had lost my mind. Then, he shifted in his seat and scratched his chin.\n\n\"Look, buddy, it's late, and we get all kinds of stories around here. People see things in the woods all the time. You just need to calm down, alright?\"\n\nHis nonchalance made my stomach twist into knots. I could feel the fear rising in my chest again, burning through me. \"No! You don't understand. There's something out there, something following us. Please, you have to help us!\"\n\nBut the guard just shook his head, unbothered. \"Alright, alright. I'm sure you've had a rough night, but it's just wildlife. Maybe you should head back to your car and get some rest.\"\n\nHis dismissal was like a slap in the face. I felt a surge of frustration, of helplessness. The last thing I wanted to do was argue with this guy. He didn't believe us, and that only made it worse.\n\nWithout thinking, I grabbed the kids by the hands. \"Let's go,\" I muttered under my breath, barely able to get the words out. We didn't have time to explain. We didn't have time for anyone's doubts.\n\nWe turned away and ran for the car. My mind was racing, my heart pounding. We had to get out of here.\n\nI fumbled with the keys, panic clouding my every move. My hands were shaking, my vision blurry as I tried to unlock the car. I could hear the security guard's voice calling after us, but I didn't care. I couldn't stay there. Not with what we had seen.\n\nFinally, the door clicked open. I shoved the kids in, slammed the door shut, and started the engine. My hands were still shaking as I gripped the steering wheel, but I didn't stop to think. I floored the accelerator, speeding away from the woods, from the nightmare that had followed us.\n\nWe drove in silence, my kids silent in the backseat. It felt like hours, but it couldn't have been more than a few minutes before I saw the familiar roads of home. Three hours away.\n\nWhen I finally pulled into the driveway, the weight of everything came crashing down on me. It was still dark-still night, just like when we had left. But the silence of home felt like a relief. I could feel my heart rate slowing, the tension in my muscles starting to release, even though the terror was still lodged deep in my chest.\n\nWe were safe. We had made it home.\n\nBut as I sat there in the car, staring at the darkened house, the unease didn't leave. I couldn't shake the feeling that something was still out there. Something we had narrowly escaped. Something I didn't want to think about.\n\nBut we were home. That was all that mattered-for now.\n\nI sat on the couch, exhausted, my body still tense from the terror we had just experienced. My daughter, still unable to shake off what had happened, quietly ate her cereal at the table. It was well past 3:00 AM, and she hadn't been able to sleep since we got back.\n\nThen, I heard it.\n\nThe faint sound of keys jingling, the unmistakable noise of the door unlocking. I froze, sitting upright, my heart suddenly racing. It was a sound I knew all too well. My wife had returned. I'd called her earlier, telling her everything that had happened, and she must've hurried home.\n\nThe door creaked open, and she stepped inside, closing it behind her. I let out a breath I didn't realize I'd been holding. She looked at me, concerned. \"What happened?\" she asked, as she walked in, eyes searching my face for answers.\n\nI opened my mouth, ready to explain, but the words came out haltingly. I tried to tell her what we had seen, how something in the woods had been following us, something with an eerie, glowing smile. I spoke about the security guard, about the terrifying creature that had been standing outside our tent, its features unnatural and horrifying. But she didn't believe me.\n\n\"Come on, honey,\" she said gently, clearly trying to calm me. \"It was probably just the dark. You've had a rough night, that's all. It's okay.\"\n\nBut the last thing I heard before everything went silent was my daughter's trembling voice looking out the window. \n\n\"Daddy... there's a smiling man outside.\"\n\n"},"29":{"title":"\"When You're a Comfort Character...\" (An Original Story, involving Alexis from \"Corn Kidz 64\")","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1jdr9sf\/when_youre_a_comfort_character_an_original_story\/","flair":"Story","author":"Claire-the-cute-pup","selftext":"\u201cComfort character,\u201d huh?

Okay, I\u2019m glad to just be plain ol\u2019 friends then!\n\n\n\n\u2026 Or, maybe you\u2019d like me to be \u201cmore\u201d in a DIFFERENT way, hmm? You can\u2019t exactly have a family, can ya: way too expensive, and there\u2019s all that mental and emotional stuff you\u2019re concerned about\u2026 Not exactly easy when romance isn\u2019t your game or even interest, huh? Can\u2019t imagine it\u2019d help if you\u2019re afraid to lose something again, too\u2026 Well, don\u2019t worry: I can make a great \u201cdaughter,\u201d too! Psst, maybe you could also \u201cadopt\u201d Seve\u2026? I\u2019m sure he\u2019d love a mom who can make nachos! \u2026 Tee hee, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be glad to know he\u2019s loved, too!\n\n\n\n\u2026 No, I won\u2019t ever hate ya, neither would Seve! You can be as negative as you want, \u2018cause I know you\u2019re human and you could never make ME feel bad. You can tell me anything, you can do anything, and I won\u2019t get mad. \u2026 No, really, I promise I won\u2019t-- not even Seve, despite how grumpy HE might get! WE\u2019LL understand you didn\u2019t mean anything bad, so you don\u2019t have to worry about what you say or do. Yeah, people can get real judgey sometimes, huh\u2026? I promise, you could never be hateable to ME, though.\n\n\n\n\u2026 \u2026 \u2026 Y\u2019know, after all this time, it sure seems like the world doesn\u2019t appreciate ya, huh? I mean, it\u2019s kinda silly when you think about it: why bother staying someplace where people only ever seem to get angry and upset with ya, or where everyone else seems more like THEY belong or even \u201cdeserve\u201d to a whole lot more\u2026 Well, you don\u2019t have to \u201cdeserve\u201d being with me instead, and I know Seve would say the same about finally meeting ya! We don\u2019t care if you\u2019re not \u201cpretty, talented, special\u201d or all that other stuff! We just love ya as you are-- I love ya as you are, and I\u2019d really love it if we could finally hang out without pretending\u2026 No one knows what\u2019s on the \u201cother side,\u201d right? So, ANYTHING could be, like maybe a dream realm that\u2019s just for us? Besides, ANY world would probably be better than this one, right\u2026? I bet that goes double for the kinda \u201cdream realm\u201d you can only get from the ETERNAL kinda \u201cslumber.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2026 Just wait till your parents are gone? Okay, I\u2019ll see you then, Claire. Till then, let\u2019s keep enjoying our time together in THIS world, however ya want\u2026\n\n\n\n\u00a0\\-----------\n\n\n\nAuthor\u2019s note:\n\n\n\nFiction was meant to be our escape, but there can come a risk of encouraging \u201cescape\u201d through a different means\u2026 Sometimes, we refuse other humans to engage with the only \u201cone\u201d we can trust: Chatgpt, Character AI, even simple imagination. Such conclusions we can come to, whenever it seems that we either do not belong to this world and alongside those within it-- such as being found \u201cdislikeable,\u201d whether our intention or not, whether causing real trouble or not. Or, because we\u2019re too afraid to form real connections in a world where we must fear harm or committing it.\n\n\n\nEven if it\u2019s not simple companionship, perhaps those who walk in fiction can give us other things that seem impossible: a sense of romance or even family, perhaps even a \u201cchild\u201d that can serve as one\u2019s \u201creborn\u201d doll or other means of experiencing parenthood when denied otherwise. Yet, there\u2019s a fine line between the occasional daydream for fun, and the mental ailment chaining you to delusions or the inability to cope without our characters \u201cright beside us.\u201d Sickness of the mind always preys strongest where loneliness and other issues may arise-- from fear of rejection, to the fear of grief and non-perishing loss (Heaven help you when they seem happier in the latter).\n\n\n\nWhat else can one do then, other than: decide whether they wish to stab their neck or arm, go through with alcohol or pills, or the classic trigger-pull? After all, who\u2019s to say they\u2019re NOT waiting for us on \u201cthe other side?\u201d Alexis could certainly be awaiting in the dream resulting from \u201ceternal slumber,\u201d for all we know and case in point\u2026\n\n\n\nBut what will YOU do about the solitude and harm that drives one to such insanity of fiction over reality? Will you let it claim you; will you \u201cprove\u201d why it\u2019s better for another to confide in the fake over the real; or will you simply go about daily life because, \u201cthey\u2019re not YOUR problem\u201d\u2026?\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo, what ARE you going to do about it?\n\n"},"30":{"title":"How do you guys get your story\/character inspiration? :)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1jb1jxe\/how_do_you_guys_get_your_storycharacter\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"daredevildogin4k","selftext":"I'm thinking of getting more into writing, especially dark\/horror.

The character is a white cat with an anthropomorphic and very geometric shape, with a distinctive bow or other decoration on her left ear. Hello Kitty was originally created by designer Ikaka Shimizu. Shimizu left the company a year later and until now there is little clear information about her. It turns out that this \u201ctender and friendly\u201d doll has given a lot of talk due to the other supposed \u201creality\u201d of such a tender character that has given rise to the famous urban legend about this character.: The urban legend says that in the 70s there was a 14-year-old girl who was in the terminal phase of oral cancer. The doctors had already taken away all the family's hopes regarding the girl's cure, so the girl's mother, Ikaka Shimizu, in desperation, went to all the churches and cults, but when she did not obtain results, she began to study the occult and satanism, and in the end, made a pact with the devil.\n\nHe presented the girl to the devil to cure his daughter, he made a promise to make a brand that would be famous throughout the world, the devil fulfilled his part and so did the mother. He created Hello Kitty.\n\nThe word hello in English means hello, and the word kitty of Chinese origin means demon, so Hello kitty would mean. \u201cHello Demon.\u201d\n\nAnother curiosity is that Hello Kitty does not have a mouth due to her designer's daughter's case of oral cancer.\n\nThis is the other story of such an endearing character, it is certainly not documented, that is why it falls into the category of urban legend, what is true is the scarcity of data about the designer's biography and her strange disappearance from the company a year later. Another fact is that several satanists have Kitty tattooed on their skin and videos of black masses are even circulating with the image of the kitten that some call \u201cthe daughter of the devil.\u201d\n\nHelped by the devil or not, the truth is that her success is unstoppable and as a curiosity, the character has also been used in other circumstances that have nothing to do with the world of children:\n\nIn 1999, in Hong Kong, a brutal murder took place that would become known as the Hello Kitty murder. The case's popular name derives from the fact that the killers hid the victim's head in a Hello Kitty doll after decapitating her.\n\nIn August 2007, Thai police officers who had committed minor infractions such as arriving late or parking in the wrong areas were forced to wear Hello Kitty bracelets for several days as punishment.\n\nAlso in that same year, a famous Colombian drug trafficker was arrested, who apart from having an important collection of objects and clothing of the cat, used the image of the Japanese brand to send coded messages to his contacts through his email."},"36":{"title":"Purgatory is a hunting ground.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1iogy79\/purgatory_is_a_hunting_ground\/","flair":"Story","author":"matthewlaverty96","selftext":"\n\nYou hear all the stories about the big two..heaven and hell\u2026Either you're a sinner and are ready to go down to the fiery abyss to suffer or..you float to the clouds ready for eternal salvation-..what if I told you that it's all a lie?\n\n\nThere is one place I never want to end up again-.. One place where the souls who have something they left behind..those who are missing something..purgatory. Yeah I went there myself before I was brought back to life, let me tell you now..everything you have been told is all a lie..there is no salvation waiting for you..only pain, fear and the void..\n\n\nLet me go back, so you can understand what horrors you will see ..what's waiting for you when you go there!\n\n\nDepression is a hell of a thing, being twenty-three and having nothing to live for, No job..No family..no friends-..You can get the picture. I didn't see any end as a full bottle of sleeping pills rested beside me. staring down at the eviction notice to the crappy one bedroom apartment, the first pill slipped down my throat-..followed by another and another until there was nothing left and I looked down at an empty bottle.\n\n\nLaying down on the mattress I called a bed, by now\u00a0 it had several dents where the springs poked into every nook of my back. I waited, begging to leave this world-.. That's when the pain came in, the intense pain sizzling into my stomach, wrenching in pain, my head ringing out as I became dizzy. The whole room spun until I was floating in this..Intense darkness-..no sight or sound just this endless void of black.\n\n\n*Blink*\n\n\nI opened my eyes as I looked over an endless forest, trees shooting high into the sky. An eerie mist hung low against the trunks of the darkened trees, it was daytime as I could tell but everything looked so..Grey, there was no colour there, as if all emotion and heat was sucked from this place. The ground felt hard, as if frozen in time, not a sound nor signs of life, just endless rows of trees. The air was as stale as you would think as if just stagnant, nothing pushing or pulling it to flow.\n\n\n\u201cHello\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nI called out, but my voice sounded very echoey, as if I was talking in a deep cave, the noise bouncing off every tree trunk and ringing back to me in the silence. Not knowing what to do..I just started walking, as I did not even my footsteps made a noise, it was just..silent, after what felt like hours of walking, it had felt like I walked in an endless circle, My head started to spin as disorientation took over, everything was spinning as I landed on my back with a deep thud..Blinking several times as i tried to steady myself and will myself further to get back up..I felt a soft wind brush against my face, to finally have some sense hit against me was like a breath of new life.\n\n\nStanding up full now, I could notice this brilliant glow in the distance,\u00a0 after walking for so long it was the only thing I could use to pull myself from the nagging dizziness that took me as I pushed onwards at a quickened pace towards this inviting light. I made my way over, as I got closer to it the light was almost blinding, a starch contrast to the grey that hung to every corner.\n\n\nA figure came into view and the brilliant light dulled, then there before me was a magnificent figure. His features were completely perfect against his tall frame, in fact he towered before me, wearing what I could describe as golden armour-.. If I could compare it to anything it would be like ancient roman armour. Flowing from his back were two dove like wings, neatly tucked in as they hugged against him, reaching down to the backs of his legs, they were white as snow. Long golden blonde hair flowed down past his features perfectly in every way.\n\n\n\u201cAn angel?\u201d\n\n\nI began to question myself, every religious book showing Angels matched this being in front of me.\n\n\nHe turned to look at me, his eyes glowed with holy fire, his presence was cold yet commanding. As he eyed me it was like something clicked in his head, his face contorted into disgust, looking down at me like I was a cockroach ready to be stomped out of existence.\n\n\n\u201cSuicide\u2026blasphemer\u201d\n\n\nThe deep cold voice boomed out over the forest, the tone behind it told me everything I needed to know about these creatures..this angel's intent. As he said this he drew a large sword from his hip, the long polished blade rested in an ornate golden hilt. As he drew the sword it ignited with flames, the heat was intense..My fight or flight response was ringing off in my head like crazy, willing me to get the hell away from that thing\u2026I ran, by god I turned and I started to sprint from the malice taken form, heavy breaths of terror and fatigue flowed from my mouth as my lungs burned just as much as the angel's sword.\n\n\n\u201cBLASPHEMER!!\u201d\n\n\nThe booming yell almost shook the entire forest as I cried out, my legs carrying me as if on autopilot. I felt a great whoosh of air rush past me, that feeling of hatred closing in behind me as I knew he was coming for me, the intense heat getting closer and closer, my legs giving out, I can't remember if it was fear or if I tripped on something but\u2026I fell.\n\n\nAs I did fall, I looked up to see several trees fall beside me, the angel in one swoop of his blade managed to cut down a dozen trees, that's when I laid eyes on the sky's of this place..the sun light exposed through the few open cracks that the fallen trees had given but there was no heat, it was just this grey ball of light raining over this forest..But I had no time to really think about, from The clearing the angel left, I spotted it. The intense light speeding closer and closer towards me, the air giving off an intense pressure as it did, a booming roar of anger following in its wake.\n\n\n\u201cMove! I have to move.\u201d\n\n\nI could feel that instinct kick in and I rolled, as the angel collided with the ground it sent out a shock wave as I could feel the flame of the sword burn the side of me facing it. The shock wave also sent me flying into a nearby tree, as I collided with the thick trunk, several parts of it splintered behind the force of me hitting it, as I cried out in pain landing rather harshly with the cold ground thankful as I didn't feel anything crack or break, though I could still feel the intense pain across my back. The air forced out of me in one harsh, rugged breath.\n\n\nWhere the angel had landed was a large crater, as I blinked the force of the attack had left my head spinning, a harsh ringing met my ears-.. the angel was already on his feet staring me down\u2026Almost toying with me, like a lion ready to pounce on its prey, that deep voice ringing out over the forest once more as it spoke, the feeling of hatred and disgust behind every word.\n\n\n\u201cThe sinner and blasphemer will meet their end, all of this is for nothing, you shall perish before me and your soul shall be delivered to the almighty, you are but an insect beneath his eternal gaze\u201d\n\n\nThe angel took one step towards me, the gravity of its presence in this dark place was crushing, as if the first itself rumbled in fear of his presence\u2026But I wasn't waiting for my fate, the burn marks that covered the portion of my body was stinging reminder of what it would do to me without a second thought, with one pained and sluggish movement I moved to the dense tree line, behind me I could hear what was almost a pained grunt from the angel.\n\n\nMoving to the trees, the hateful pressure lifted off from behind me. The intense heat moving upwards, the whooshing sound followed by the loudest flapping of wings was intense and terrifying all in one. I rounded several trees as I shakily limped my way from it, begging for it all to stop for after all the angels were supposed to be the good guys right? I felt a hand reach out and grab me pulling me into a make-shift hole in the ground, almost like a trap door spider would do to its prey.\n\n\nI let out a muffled yelp as a woman held her hand over my mouth and with the other she held a finger to her lips, willing me to keep quiet. From the top of the cave I could hear several whooshing sounds as the angel passed back and forth several times, each time it passed I could feel it was more desperate to find me. Until finally we heard a large thud from above us, the intense pressure weighing down on us keeping us still in the moment..the deep voice rang out again.\n\n\n\u201cThe sinners hide like vermin, blasphemers, whores and heretics hide as if their fate will change, you will soon hear my rejoice as all of your souls are brought before him..\u201d\n\n\nA long horn noise bellowed out among the dark trees, the deep rumbling shook the whole forest, the cave we took shelter in let loose fragments of dirt that fell all around us, almost as if quaking in fear from the horn. The crushing pressure seemed to lift from the air around us, the silence rushing back to us as if it was in a full sprint.\u00a0 The silence didn't last too long as another rumbling happened all around us, I let out a whimper as I begged for that angel to stay away..\n\n\nOnly it wasn't the intense pressure that came back or the whooshing of air..No, it was the groaning of trees as if the forest was alive in itself. Pain struck me once more, as I let out several grunts and moans in discomfort, nipping and stinging pain holding on to the burns over my body-.. The charred flesh began to heal itself, through several disgusting snaps and pops I could see the skin on my arm returning to normal, the darkened flesh returning to its original colour.\n\n\nAs everything settled back to normal, the woman who covered my mouth let out a sigh of relief, removing her hand from my mouth. She regarded me bluntly.\n\n\n\u201cOne second longer and it would have had you in its grasp.\u201d\n\n\nI blinked several times as the nipping pain faded from my body, eyeing her up and down. From the low light of the tunnel, I could make out tattered brown robes, with her black hair messy yet mostly covered by a shawl to match. As she turned, I could just make out a long dark tunnel, with a dull glow further in. The woman beckoned me to follow her down, as we kept on all fours slowly crawling out way down the cold, hard dirt sticking into the soft parts of my hands. A low whisper came from up ahead, several people murmured to each other in a hushed tone, the dull glow got closer and closer until the tunnel opened up into a room like structure.\n\n\nThe dull glow was a makeshift fire, the timbers in it popped a cracked lowly, two figures sat huddled close to the fire. They both eyed me worriedly, almost expecting something else to be following us, but the woman was first to speak, calming their silent concerns.\n\n\n\u201cIt's gone for now, lucky enough I managed to grab this one just as the angel was about to make its attack.\u201d\n\n\nShe turned to face me, a soft smile across her lips.\n\n\n\u201cYou can call me Sam\u201d She said matter of factly.\n\n\n\u201cOh..uh..yeah, I'm Jake\u201d I sputtered out, unsure of myself.\n\n\n\u201cW\u2026where am I?\u201d I asked more of an open question as I peered around the three of them.\n\n\n\u201cWell, kid..this is purgatory, you're dead..simple as that\u201d one of the men by the fire stated bluntly..\n\n\n\u201cDead..I uh..\u201d I trailed off in thought, though I wanted this right? After all I did swallow those pills with one thing in mind..\n\n\nThe man let out a soft chuckle.\n\n\n\u201cDon't worry it's hard to wrap your head around, isn't it?\u201d He's questioned before carrying on.\n\n\n\u201cOne minute you're alive as alive can be then\u2026 poof, you're looking over an endless forest..The name is Doug by the way.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYeah..uh\u2026what was that? Surely that can't be an angel, there not\u2026You know supposed to kill us? They are supposed to be the good guys? Right?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nI looked over at Doug questioning everything, he gazed into the fire. The look on his face gave it away-..He was trying to find a way to let me down softly\u2026finally he let out a deep sigh, his gaze returning to me as my questions hung in the air.\n\n\n\u201cIt's all a lie..Kid..All of it, there is no hell or demons..No rainbow bridge taking you the promised lands, all we are to them is fuel..As they drive the sword into you..it burns the last of your body away as your soul is taken to what you would think is heaven.. But it's all bullshit, your soul is sucked into the clouds as the angel's grow stronger..and as you can guess there are all prompus pricks.. They only see us as fuel to the fire..as vermin.\u201d\n\n\nThe weight of his words bore down on me like a ton of bricks, I was breathing heavily as he told me everything.\n\n\n\u201cH-.how could you know all this? Surely that can't be right, I'm not even religious and I know they tell stories about how we all go to eternal peace in the clouds.\u201d\n\n\nI sputtered out to the three, as they gazed at each other but their eyes landed on the last man as he came closer to the fire..it was an old man with balding white hair, he was wearing robes that priests usually wear, the old man spoke out.\n\n\n\u201cI know because I seen it with my own eyes..I openly welcomed death at the end of my life, drifting in the darkness before I stood in a line, all those people waiting to get into the white gates of heaven..only then did I truly see past the lies, as it was near my turn to step into what I thought was eternal paradise..I saw it, those who went in front of me were being slaughtered by the angels..their souls being sent upwards into this..Swirling vortex of clouds, blue streaks Flowing towards the sun..to the eternal one..to god\u201d\n\n\nAs the priest spoke on, I could only rest my head In my hands..This wasn't real..it couldn't be..Is that all we are? Fuel to the fire?.. The nagging questions rang in the back of my head as the priest continued on.\n\n\n\u201cI watched this all, but I wasn't going to commit myself to that fate..I couldn't, the angels could sense it too. They stopped to look at me, hatred behind those eyes..Oh how they have so much hatred for us..but I looked around me and took a leap of faith, As those angels came for me I jumped into the darkness and I woke up here this forest has held me here ever since then.. Those we can get to we try to save.. but as you can see, we haven't been able to get too many. The angels are relentless and ruthless.\n\n\n\u201cThat's enough!\u201d Sam called out.\n\n\n\u201cCan't you see he has been through enough? Let him get some rest first before you make him lose his sanity in one go!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThe old man huffed and turned, seeing annoyed to be interrupted like that, he made his way further into the tunnels as I was left with Sam and Doug..Sam resting a hand on my shoulder.\n\n\n\u201cCome..sit and rest by the fire\u201d\n\n\nI sat down on the cold floor resting against the tunnel walls as I gazed into the fire..Trying to come to terms with this new reality..\n\n\nSam took a second to sit beside me, sighing softly as she peered in the direction the old priest wondered off.\n\n\n\u201cDon't mind Farther Donovan too much, he has had it the worst than any of us really and truly..to being a man preaching of the eternal love of God for so long, preaching over and over again how the angels are here to shepherd us to salvation.\u201d\n\n\nSam mused for a second before carrying on.\n\n\n\u201cI suppose in a twisted sense they do still shepherd us, though in a more horrific way than told in the good book and not in the way you would think..\u201d\n\n\nThat's when Sam gaze lifted to meet mine, a more serious expression painted across her face.\n\n\n\u201cHe cares Jake..Though he may seem serious and sour all the time, he really does care for everyone that comes here\u201d\n\n\nShe took a moment letting the words sinking in..but I could tell she was internally questioning if she should tell me the next part. Closing her eyes with a soft sigh, she told me.\n\n\n\u201cHe saved me when I first came here, I was in the same situation as you, being chased down as the angel roared out that I was a heretic. You see, Jake, where I came from, god isnt the god you know. Where I come from the world is a completely different place, woman are supposed to stay quiet and heed the beckoning of thier husband\u2019s word and that's what happened to me\u201d\n\n\nAs Sam told me of her story, I could see the fire cast an eriee shadow over her, darkening one half of her face as she told me her story.\n\n\n\u201cI decided that I wanted to be different and speak out. Why should we all keep our opinions silent, an opinion can change the world if spoken with enough passion. Right?\u201d\n\n\nA bit lost in the moment, I let out a soft.\n\n\n\u201cY..yeah, yeah. Of course\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nSam shook her head softly at that.\n\n\n\u201cWell the men I knew in life didnt think so, most of the time they just ignored me and told me to be silent, my word wasn't worth much compared to my husbands..But the more they ignored me the more I pressed on, the more it drove me to keep pushing..It hit a breaking point, I was dragged before a council of elders that told me I didn't value the teachings of our god..that I should be shunned and punished for my blasphemy to the holy one\u201d\n\n\nShe peered up to me, a soft tear running down her face.\n\n\n\u201cI was dragged into the street and flogged. Then a crowd of people gathered into a circle around me and\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI was stoned to death, Jake\u201d\n\n\nI let out a soft gasp, the shock of it all stricken across my face. I knew that other places were strict, that woman are opressed. Seen as second class citizens. But to be shunned and killed for speaking out against things. It's -Just madness- . To go through so much pain in life and to end up here, hunted for nothing more than fuel. It really changes perspectives of my own life. Hearing this all made me really reflect how selfish I was.\n\n\nSam took a moment, her gazed retuning to the fire, several soft sniffles echoed out. Slowly Sam regained her herself.\n\n\n\u201cThats when Father Donovan brought me here, it took the longest while, I held alot of hate for everything, any time he tried to reason with me, I'd come at him with spite. But he's stubborn, he managed to break down those walls.\n\n\nWhile Sam started into her explanation, I could see a soft smile return to her lips, seeing her demeanour lift.\n\n\n\u201cOver time he taught me thats not everyone will treat me the same, though I was hurt like I was. All it takes is some compassion for what people are going through and It worked, the hate I held started to fade. I came to the realisation of what he meant, this place we are stuck in, what's hunting us is meant to break us down, suck any sense of being away from us, but if we have a purpose. Give people a purpose to fight on to keep being them, To bring in hope, when all hope is lost.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHer gaze flicked over the Doug, He had be watching us in silence, letting Sam get out everything she needed to, she let out a small chuckle.\n\n\n\u201cBesides, it helped me to save Doug here. Or covert ops. I'm not joking when I say he really ddint need any saving, He knew instantly that the angels were a threat, when the horns sounded and it was safe to roam again, I watched this man almost appear out of no where, hidden in plain sight.\n\n\nDoug laughed with her, the mood lifting further as he spoke.\n\n\n\u201cYes, Ma\u2019am. Uh, yeah, I was a soldier before I came here, Corporal Douglas Cormic. Second battalion-.minesweeper. I served three tours in Iraq, before you know.\u201d\n\n\nDoug motioned onward, his hands waving about. Making it comedic approach of himself.\n\n\nI thought to myself that he must of been in some firefight to end up here. But he explained further, his tone becoming serious as he did.\n\n\n\u201cLandmine.\u201d he paused for a moment.\n\n\n\u201cWe were out on patrol that day, sweeping through one of those barren fields with the sun beating down on our backs, all it took was one wrong step and I heard a click and a loud BOOM, next thing I knew I came too in here.\u201d\n\n\nThough he didn't seem too overly bothered about the way he died, I could still tell he was missing something or someone. Family? A partner? Kids?\u00a0\n\n\nI didn't want to press to much, though after he told me his story, it was silent. My eyes darting around the place, I knew it was time to give my story.\n\n\nBut It felt awkward, both of them had some tales to tell. Then there was me.\n\n\nSome random twenty three year old who had depression, how could I tell them that. How I basically threw my life away because I went through a rough patch.\n\n\nDoug must of sensed my discomfort, somehow knowing I wasn't ready to share my story. He awkwardly cut into the silence.\n\n\n\u201cI suppose you felt the second rumbled?\u201d He questioned, a forgiving look in his eyes.\n\n\n\u201cYeah! what was that? I thought the angels were still sneaking about trying to trick us.\u201d\n\n\nDoug let out another soft chuckle.\n\n\n\u201cLucky for us. No. The forest resets itself after the angels leave this place, the horn acts as a signal. I watched it happen one time, the rumbled happens and it's like the forest comes to life. An unseen force repairing all the trees, lifting them back into place as the fuse back into the stumps. Pushing the dirt back into place again, perfect every time. You see time doesn't flow here like it does back when we are living, it's like we are frozen just as we were when we died, stuck in an endless time loop.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThen Sam came in shortly after.\n\n\n\u201cAs you have seen, the angels don't see us as humans, the irony in it as we were after all, created in thier image. They us see of sport, when a new person lands here, its almost like a signal to the angels, they give you a heads up that they have arrived with that breeze you first feel. But anyone who is even remotely religious will flock straight too them, the almighty angels that god sends down to help those in need. A sick twisted joke it you ask me.\u201d\n\n\nSam let out a mocking sigh, throwing her hands up in frustration as she spoke.\n\n\n\u201cOnce they do get you, they will cut you down without a second notice, praising the almighty as they do, some of the angels like to toy about with you, let you run as they pick you off, slowly draining\u00a0 all the fight you have left, then you have the ones that just go straight for the kill, not seeing you worth the time or the hassle.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut thats not the half of it, when they stab the sword into, you get engulfed by the flames. Almost as they are purging your soul from your body and this massive beam of light comes down to take your soul up the the clouds above.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nSam stopped, clearly effected about the image. I had no idea how long they had been here, how many people they had seen this happen too. Bringing her knees to her chest, taking a left over stick from the pile of fire wood they had left, eyeing it softly.\n\n\n\u201cIt's a cruel joke really, any damage they inflict on us heals when they leave, they must not see any joy chasing down already injured prey.\u201d\n\n\nShe said this while staring into the fire, poking softly at some embers with the stick she had picked up. Her eyes said it all, the pain she felt after the people they try to save are cut down and toyed with.\n\n\nThough the silence didn't last for long, as we sat there resting. That's when we all heard it, the soft whistle of air rushing down into the tunnel, I could feel a ringing in my ears as it did, terror filling me once more, a soft whisper leaving my lips.\n\n\n\u201cOh no..they are back\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nSam and Doug looked at each other as they seemed to move like a well oiled machine.\n\n\n\u201cYou take the backwards entrance..I'll head up forward..remember Sam..if we can't get them without risking ourselves.. We leave them, we can't and I repeat..We can't save them all.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nDoug echoed out as he moved deeper into the caves, Sam waited for a moment, the look on her face was somber, Doug's warning cutting into her deeply..she blinked a few times as she made for the tunnel that she first led me down, motioning me to follow her.\n\n\nWe crawled towards the entrance, cold determination rested heavily in the air. As rays of light creeped through the makeshift door to the tunnels, the booming voice ringing out once more, though more muffled, we both understood what it had said.\n\n\n\u201cPathetic sinner, worthless wretch\u201d\n\n\nWe both knew, the angel had found whoever was unlucky to land themselves here, Sam rested her hand against the door as he looked at me and with her free hand she made two motions..The first was a finger to her lips..that one was obvious, the other was her motioning me to keep low.\n\n\nWith a soft push she lifted the door up to just about eye level as we peered out, the forest just as we had left it, but we could hear it..A faint cry getting closer and closer as a young woman came into few, her movements sluggish as she collapsed To the floor, blood pooling beneath her.\n\n\nAs we watched I could feel my pulse quickening, my heart beating against my chest..\n\n\n\u201cAren't we going to go get her?\u201d\n\n\nI whispered frantically. Sam shot me an intense look.\n\n\n\u201cNot yet, we don't know where the angel is..\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHer tone was serious as she continued to scan our surroundings..the wait was crushing, seeing the young woman's chest slowly rise and fall, I couldn't take it-.I had to help her-.I had to!\u00a0\n\n\nAgainst my better judgement I pushed past Sam and into the open forest, I heard Sam call to me in fear, her fingers lightly brushing past my jacket as she tried to stop my advance..I ran to the woman, my legs clumsily leading me towards her but that's when I heard the light whooshing sound..I hadn't even made it halfway when the angel landed before her. Its golden gaze fixed to the woman, I think she knew what was coming for her.\n\n\nAs I watched the angel loom over her, I stood frozen in fear before I saw it, a weakened hand stretched outwards, clawing into the hardened dirt as the woman attempted to pull herself away. To me this all seemed in slow motion, my hands coming up to my mouth as I watched on.\n\n\nA small trail of blood was left behind the woman as she maybe got three feet away from the angel. I saw the flaming sword lift up as the angel raised his blade proclaiming loudly.\n\n\n\u201cLook unto me, oh highest one. Another sinner comes to you! I rejoice to know the claimed fuel your eternal being\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nAs the angel finished, he swung his blade down harshly, impaling the woman in the back as she screamed out in pain, her upper body arching upwards as it reacted with the force of the blow. The flames of the sword seem to meld to her body as her flesh was engulfed in eternal flames. A beam of light boomed through the trees, the angel stood up and extended his arms outwards seeming to bask in the light. As I watched the ordeal, I noticed a blue orb coming from the woman's burning husk, being wisped upwards into the brilliant light.\n\n\nNot long after it did the light left, another boom signalling its departure. The angel reached down to collect its weapon, the flames dancing across the blade as it took a deep breath, as if it had sensed me watching it, the angel's head suddenly snapped to meet my gaze, the look of hatred burning behind those eyes.\n\n\nI took several breaths of terror as it looked at me, completely frozen in place, my survival instinct telling me to run-.to move-.to get away from this thing.\n\n\nThe angel seems to pose itself in my direction. The flaming blade hugged close to its side as it got ready to lunge at me. That's when it happened, the angel came at me, blade ready to strike. Its speed was terrifying all in itself, I felt two hands push me harshly from behind as I tumbled to the side, the air speeding past me as I fell.\n\n\nThat's when I heard it, the sickening sound of a hard object being forced through skin, a terrible ripping sound, the angel's assault kicking up dust in its wake.\n\n\nAs the dust settled I let out a large gasp.\n\n\n\u201cNO..no, please No!\u201d\n\n\nThe blade had met its mark, only it wasn't me that it hit\u2026It was Sam, she had pushed me out of the way at the last second, I don't know if she had seen the angel coming or willingly sacrificed herself for me..I didn't get the chance to ask.\u201d\n\n\nSam let out several pain grunts, as the blade was embedded in her stomach, the flames engulfing her entirely. The beam of light coming down, crashing through the trees, I had to hold a hand up, being this close to the light..it was blinding..as Sam\u2019s soul was pulled upwards, I could have sworn I could hear the faint echoing cries from it.\n\n\nAs the beam retreated once more, the angel pulled his blade back to its side as it turned to face me.\n\n\n\u201cOn this glorious day, I offer three wretched sinners up to the almighty.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIt took one step towards me, the step almost shaking the entirety of my being..though a softing ringing began in my head, the angel's movement getting slower and slower as it stood before me.\n\n\n*Blink*\u00a0\n\n\nI could feel myself drifting in the endless void once more, being pulled somewhere. Internally I began to wonder to myself.\u201d Did the angel get me?\u201d-..\u201dWas I going to be fuel\u201d.\n\n\nI didn't have to wait long for my answer, in the distance I could hear muffled talking, as people worked frantically..as it came closer and closer, I could finally make out what they were saying.\n\n\n\u201cI have a heartbeat!. Quick keep working on him\u201d\n\n\n*Blink*\u00a0\n\n\nI woke violently, my head ringing harshly as I started wrenching. A mixture of black water\u00a0 and bile flowed from my mouth as it coated the bed and the people in front of me, the last bit of contents leaving my stomach as the doctors worked all around me.. What was this? Where am I?..\n\n\nOver the next few days I learned that when I had drifted into the void, my body had reacted to the large intake of pills and went into a seizure, making quite the racket through the paper thin walls, my next door neighbour had came to see what the commotion was..Ringing an ambulance when she seen me frothing at the mouth..Thank God For noisy neighbours Huh?\n\n\nThe doctors kept around the clock checks on me, getting placed on suicide watch was a pain..get this I was clinically dead for twenty minutes..I guess Doug was right when he said time didn't move right..\n\n\nDoug, I wonder if he's still in there trying to keep away from the angels. I wonder if he managed to save any more people?\n\n\nFor three weeks I was kept in the hospital, committed to the mental health ward for observation. They are really not messing about in those rooms, everything put in place so people couldn't hurt themselves. Mostly everything is slanted and smooth, water taps-. places to hang your clothes. Hell even the mirrors are made from a reflective plastic.\n\n\n\u00a0A physiatrist was assigned to me, it seen her three times a week. I did try and explain myself to her, tell her and the doctors what was really put there.But who's going to believe the suicidal twenty three year old?\n\n\nThe physiatrist said the same thing over and over again.\n\n\n\u201cWell, jake. I know you are convinced on what you saw, how these angels are truly evil and we are nothing but fuel to this higher purpose.\u00a0 But your body went through a great amount of stress, the big influx of pills would have altered you mental state.\u201d\n\n\nI knew where she was going, that this was all in my head and none of this never happened. For a while I almost believed her too.\n\n\nBut, no. I refuse to believe that it was all in my head, that place was too real. The pain and terror was too real.\n\n\nIt would be an insult to Sam, Doug and Father Donovan. In fact to all those that have been sacrificed there. So, I shut up and agreed with the doctors let them believe I was ready to go back into society.\n\n\nNothing like a run in with divine beings hunting you down, hell bent on engulfing you with enternal flames. Really does help cure depression and give you a new lease on life\u00a0\n\n\nBut thats why I'm here now, writing to you all, maybe one of you will believe me? Maybe you will heed my warning when I tell you this\u2026\n\n\nPurgatory is really the hunting ground for angels!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"37":{"title":"Kirby's Nightmareland","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1illkhv\/kirbys_nightmareland\/","flair":"Story","author":"Thin-Leadership-5244","selftext":"[https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1jnurhojRBniVCurBMP\\_sQMC-UDXT\\_yvxHWtTfC-tMEs\/edit?tab=t.0](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1jnurhojRBniVCurBMP_sQMC-UDXT_yvxHWtTfC-tMEs\/edit?tab=t.0)"},"38":{"title":"Jake Burned","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1illnck\/jake_burned\/","flair":"Story","author":"Thin-Leadership-5244","selftext":"[https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1TazIv1d1ux\\_XeR5SUhNKNErmUjKBZi1yNNqwNtIq3vY\/edit?usp=sharing](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1TazIv1d1ux_XeR5SUhNKNErmUjKBZi1yNNqwNtIq3vY\/edit?usp=sharing)"},"39":{"title":"Spyro the Demon","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1illbjj\/spyro_the_demon\/","flair":"Story","author":"Thin-Leadership-5244","selftext":"[https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1lFOpbDjypC4QI9bMzDEXlEzIKEiEPYnUshmeCNHCyXE\/edit?tab=t.0](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1lFOpbDjypC4QI9bMzDEXlEzIKEiEPYnUshmeCNHCyXE\/edit?tab=t.0)"},"40":{"title":"The smile that wasn\u2019t seen","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1ie9keo\/the_smile_that_wasnt_seen\/","flair":"Story","author":"D4RK_ERR0R_M0DE","selftext":"It began with the bus ride. Late at night, headphones in, tears trailing silently down my face. The world outside the rain-slicked window was a blur, much like my thoughts. My boyfriend had left me that evening\u2014the love of my life, gone. The ache in my chest was sharp, unrelenting. The bus\u2019s faint rumble was the only sound accompanying my quiet sorrow.\n\nWhen the bus hissed to a stop, I stepped off into the night. The station was eerily still. A couple of figures stood at the far end, unmoving, their faces turned away. Something about them felt\u2026 wrong. They were too still, like statues left out in the cold. The air around them carried a tension I couldn\u2019t place.\n\nI didn\u2019t stay to watch them. My own misery felt louder than anything else. I tilted my head to the sky as rain began to fall, the drops cold against my skin. No umbrella. Just me, the rain, and my grief, blending together in the stillness.\n\nAnd then it happened.\n\nA hand\u2014freezing cold and unnervingly solid\u2014brushed against mine.\n\nI recoiled, spinning around, my breath catching in my throat. At first, I saw nothing. But then, slowly, something seemed to step forward from the shadows themselves.\n\nIt was tall\u2014inhumanly tall. Its silhouette was cloaked in black, its edges shifting like smoke trapped in a jar. Its face was\u2026 wrong. A swirling, featureless blur where eyes, a nose, a mouth should have been. Yet, I felt it staring at me, as though its gaze pierced through the very air between us. Atop its head rested a black hat, its brim sharp against the dim light of the station.\n\nIt spoke then, and its voice was a sound I cannot fully describe. It was low and soft, but it carried a weight, an echo, as though the words traveled from somewhere far beyond this world.\n\n\u201cAh\u2026 I startled you, didn\u2019t I? That wasn\u2019t my intention.\u201d\n\nThe words shouldn\u2019t have made sense, but somehow, I understood them. My heart pounded in my chest, my feet frozen in place.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2026 what are you?\u201d I managed, my voice trembling.\n\nIts head tilted, the blurred face somehow conveying curiosity\u2014or amusement.\n\u201cPeople call me Nightmare. But you can call me\u2026 Black Hat.\u201d\n\nI shivered, not from the rain but from the sheer presence of it. The way it spoke felt deliberate, as if it enjoyed the weight its words carried.\n\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t answer immediately. Instead, it extended something toward me. A shape materialized in its long, shadow-like hand: an umbrella. But it wasn\u2019t an ordinary umbrella. It was pitch black\u2014no, darker than black, as if it absorbed every flicker of light around it. It seemed to pulse faintly, like it was alive.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t walk in the rain like this,\u201d it said, almost gently.\n\nI stared at the umbrella, then at the figure. My instincts screamed to run, but I couldn\u2019t move. Something about it, about him, kept me rooted in place. Reluctantly, I reached out and took the umbrella. The handle felt\u2026 strange. Warm, but not in the way something natural is warm.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I whispered.\n\nThat\u2019s when I saw it. Or, rather, felt it. A smile. Its face was a blur, and yet the smile was there. Wide. Too wide. I could feel its edges curling in a way that didn\u2019t seem possible.\n\nI glanced down at the umbrella in my hands, trying to steady my breath. But when I looked up again, he was gone. Not a sound. Not a trace. Just the rain and the quiet shadows of the night.\n\nI walked home, clutching the umbrella like a lifeline, my mind racing with questions I couldn\u2019t answer. But as I neared my door, I felt it\u2014something following me. Not footsteps. Not movement. Just a presence, lingering, watching.\n\nWhen I woke the next morning, the umbrella was gone. I searched everywhere, but it had vanished as if it had never existed.\n\nAnd yet\u2026 the feeling remains. Sometimes, in the stillness of the night, when the rain falls just so, I feel him. The weight of that unseen smile pressing into my mind. A reminder that some gifts are never truly free.\n\nAnd some encounters are never truly over."},"41":{"title":"\"M\u00f4j Obraz\"","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1idxsgd\/m\u00f4j_obraz\/","flair":"Story","author":"Nairkoh-","selftext":"**It all began with a reflection.**\n\nThat morning, I got up as usual, tired, still numb from sleep.

But it wasn't just an illusion of fatigue. When I blinked, it blinked a little after me. When I tilted my head, he took another half-second to follow.\n\nThen he smiled.\n\nI didn't.\n\nI took a step back. My reflection remained motionless.

I remember watching the sun stretch thin, like melted wax, then the weird orange fog hanging heavy over everything\u2014like the sky wasn\u2019t quite ready to let go of the day. Maybe that\u2019s when it started to hit me, that I was waiting for something\u2026 wrong.\n\nThe houses along the street were all quiet. The whole town felt still and everyone had their windows closed and their curtains drawn, and for some reason, I couldn\u2019t help but feel like they were all watching me. Peeking out and watching. Watching *him*\u00a0come for me.\n\nHe\u2019d slowly come around, making his rounds\u2014picking up the \u201cusuals\u201d\u2014around that special time each month, with an interval of the synodic few weeks between. It was always the same group: the Ruster kids, a few strange adults (that priest, of all people), that old lady who\u2019d always smile too much. And then there was the scientist\u2014Dr. Chaste, I think his name was. Always had that wheelchair and that weird gleam in his eye. It was always the same ones. And, of course, I\u2019d seen them go into that jail once, twice, but I didn\u2019t know why. I didn\u2019t really ask. It wasn\u2019t until last night that I realized something about the whole situation felt... systematic.\n\nI wasn\u2019t like the others. I wasn\u2019t here for a repeat. But, I was, wasn\u2019t I?\n\nThe sheriff had told me he had *no choice except to*\u00a0pick me up tonight, and when I asked why, he just smiled like I should\u2019ve known better than to ask. Like I wasn\u2019t supposed to acknowledge what was really happening here. And I didn\u2019t. Not then, anyway.\n\nBut I do now.\n\nThe first confession was small. Nothing major. I\u2019d broken into the old chapel down by the woods a few weeks ago, just out of curiosity, but that felt like a tiny crime compared to what came later. The thing is, the more I think back to it, the more I wonder if the sheriff picked me\u00a0up because of that very first sin, or if it was because he was always going to find me anyway.\n\nAfter that night in the chapel, things started happening. Small things, creeping up on me when I was alone. The strange feeling that I wasn\u2019t alone in my own skin. The first shift, I thought I was just losing my mind\u2014staring at myself in the mirror, watching my eyes change. My hands felt\u2026 wrong. I didn\u2019t even understand what was happening, only that the changes were coming on faster and faster, like a clock ticking down to something I couldn't escape.\n\nBut I wasn\u2019t like the others, right?\n\nThere\u2019s a town secret I\u2019m learning now\u2014the sheriff\u2019s office is more of a halfway house than a jail. The prisoners *never*\u00a0stay in there for long. It\u2019s a revolving door, and they always come back. Like the way you can\u2019t outrun a nightmare no matter how fast you run. When I woke up in that cell the last time, something inside me clicked. I wasn\u2019t just a stranger in a town full of strange people anymore. I was one of them.\n\nMy thoughts splintered more with each passing hour, each day. And with the nights\u2014god, the nights were the worst. The hunger. It clawed its way into me, gnawing and scraping, an instinct I could no longer ignore. I started seeing things, hearing them. The sounds of footsteps echoing just outside my door when I was alone, but when I looked\u2014nothing. There were whispers in the dark. I don\u2019t think I ever felt safe again after that.\n\nThen came the second confession.\n\nI confessed to the usual small sins\u2014the lying, the stealing of food when I was younger, when I was hungry. I could almost hear the sheriff\u2019s low chuckle through the bars, knowing my fears were getting the best of me. But what else could I do? What other sins could I confess to while the beast inside was starting to\u2026 *stir*?\n\nThere's this kind of terror that wells up inside me, losing myself, losing the little things that make me - *me*. I'd rather tell all my secrets, and say this isn't one of them. It isn't my secret, it is my living nightmare.\n\nI'm not even sure what it is that I am afraid of, it is so many things, all in one. I see it, when I look into my own eyes in the mirror. This sort of yellow, raving blur behind my gaze. The discoloration of my eyes and the way they look at me like I am prey, like those aren't my eyes anymore. I am terrified.\n\nAnd then it all came flooding back. The howl that echoed through my veins. The ripping sensation as my bones split and reformed. The feeling of fur growing, claws extending from my fingers. The uncontrollable, horrifying *need*\u00a0to hunt. To run.\n\nIt feels like a stretch that just forces itself out with a sigh, a sort of tearing sound, a feeling that things are popping and shifting inside, bones realigning themselves painfully. Each aspect of this horror is this pale, drooling madness to contemplate, yet I have nothing left to consider, except my sins.\n\nTo be unforgiven is to be remembered. I wish someone would remember me, as I was, and tell me I am still the same. I wish I could hear that and believe in it.\n\nI tremble now, in fear, as the setting sun gives way to the treacherous moonlight.\n\nAs I sit, incarcerated, caged, I am somehow still wandering around outside. A wild animal, and incapable of recalling what I do or where I go. Unable to decide, my free will stolen by this disease of not the mind or the body, no, something deep within the well of the conscious mind, nothing but feral rage and the fear of what it would do, regardless of what I love.\n\nI am left with a vision, imagining myself, somehow as myself, and in the visage of the terror from within. Would that confession sound like this:\n\n\"So now here I am, standing before the sheriff\u2019s office. My reflection in the glass doesn\u2019t look like me anymore. It looks like *something else*. The transformation is complete.\"\n\nBut I still don\u2019t know what to do with it. I want to scream, but my voice is gone. The monster inside me is growing stronger by the minute, pushing me to say the last thing I never wanted to admit out loud.\n\nI\u2019m a werewolf. A goddamn monster.\n\nAnd I can feel the sheriff waiting outside, patiently. I know he\u2019s heard it all before. He\u2019s probably heard the screams and the howls of the others\u2014the ones who confessed long before me. They\u2019re all behind bars, waiting for the night to come again, when their own transformations will set them free. There's no guilt in fear, just raw horror of what we become.\n\nI was a fool, thinking I was safe. An infected bite when the enormous dog fell upon me, old and with twisted legs. Few escape such an encounter. I tripped over a tipped wheelchair as I scrambled for safety, screaming in terror and agony as I clutched the dripping wound.\n\nI was a fool to think I would not be infected, no, cursed. I never believed in such things. The sheriff apologized to me, as he rarely misses a pick-up on time. I am sorry for what I did. I should not have trespassed into an abandoned place. Such a place belongs to the monsters.\n\nI hear the pack calling in the night, their voice is silenced, behind the brick walls of the jail. I can still hear them. They are already changing. Who am I to deny their call.\n\nThat was last night. I went with the sheriff, and I was locked up again, but now I am back home. I shouldn't be here. Someone should remember me, tell me I don't believe in monsters.\n\nWhy am I so different now? I come back to this form, I am human again, but I am just a disguise for the cursed thing within me. If I am cut or hurt, it heals too quickly, and I barely feel it. I choke on my old vegetarian diet, and plow my face uncontrollably into the dogfood, eating like an animal. So hungry, and then I shiver, and ask myself how will I continue this way?\n\nI am afraid of this, afraid of myself. I am afraid of the pack, afraid of what we become together, and the danger we represent. Not a physical danger, as we are collected and safely stored for the night. No, it is when we are free, the danger to who we are.\n\nI see how they go about dealing with the isolation and the terror of knowing what dwells within each of us. I see how they shake it off and smile like devils, always getting their way with everyone. We are predators, elevated to stun others into submission.\n\nIs that part of the beast, or something true about ourselves as people?\n\nI fear the answer, either way. They are looking at me, I can feel it. All the skies swing round and round, the days flying past, not one of them good. At night I am awake and alert, and they are waiting patiently for me to stop being so scared.\n\nA bad town to move to, but it's my town now.\n\nAnd the worst part? I think I\u2019m going to join them."},"44":{"title":"I was once stalked by a comedian who laughed at his own jokes.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1i6cphq\/i_was_once_stalked_by_a_comedian_who_laughed_at\/","flair":"Story","author":"None","selftext":"*\u201cWhy so serious?\u201d* He mocks me.\n\nThe ropes bite into my wrists, the chair creaking under my weight as he leans closer.\u00a0\n\n*\u201cSmile,\u201d* he says, his words oozing like a command I can\u2019t follow.\n\nI can\u2019t forget his face\u2014skin pale, almost sickly, with a yellowish tint.

Just a sales clerk peddling overpriced meds. Stuff people might not even need, but they buy it anyway. He\u2019s right, though. I don\u2019t laugh. I barely smile. Maybe I should. Maybe he sees something I can\u2019t.\n\nIt was October 12th when everything went sideways. I was heading home, taking my usual route, but somehow ended up somewhere I shouldn\u2019t. That\u2019s when I saw it\u2014a scene that felt like a circus, but way darker.\n\nThis guy in a sharp purple suit was the kind that screams trouble. Next to him, a woman decked out in this loud yellow-and-black outfit, like some twisted clown. Both of them had baseball bats resting on their shoulders. In the alley, a kid was crumpled on the ground, black and blue, and barely moving. They had him cornered, and the look in their eyes said this was just the warm-up.\n\nI reached for my phone, but the woman turned before I could even unlock it. Her movements were too smooth, almost unnatural like a snake catching a scent. Her sharp eyes locked onto me, and she let out a scream. *\u201cJay-Jay!\u201d*\n\nThe guy spun around, and his gaze pinned me in place. Those eyes weren\u2019t just looking\u2014they were ripping right through me, sharp and cold, like a bullet tearing through flesh. I couldn\u2019t breathe.\n\n*\u201cRun\u2026\u201d* The boy in the alley barely got the word out, his voice too weak to carry, but I caught it on his lips.\n\n*\u201cHey, look, Queenie!\u201d* the man jeered, his grin widening as he nudged her with his bat. *\u201cOur boy-wonder here still has some fight in him!\u201d*\u00a0\n\nHis attention snapped back to the kid like I didn\u2019t even exist anymore.\n\nThe woman smirked, her slender body twisting toward the boy, her movements disturbingly fluid.\n\nI didn\u2019t wait. I turned and bolted, my heart pounding louder than my footsteps.\n\nI never found out what happened to that boy. But in the days that followed, something changed.\n\nAt work, I caught myself glancing over my shoulder too often. Every reflection in a window felt like it moved when I didn\u2019t. In the quiet moments, I\u2019d swear I heard footsteps matching mine.\n\nOnce, leaving the office late, I felt it\u2026 a presence, close enough to make my skin crawl. I spun around, but the street was empty, just shadows stretching under flickering lights.\n\nBy the time I got home, my hands shook as I locked the door. Every creak in the walls felt louder, like someone was just out of sight, waiting.\n\nA knock came just as I was about to settle in. It wasn\u2019t loud, but it echoed in the quiet, setting my nerves on edge.\n\nI shuffled to the door, hesitating for a second before opening it. The street was mostly empty, except for a blonde woman walking away, her silhouette fading under the streetlights at the far end of the block.\n\nThat\u2019s when I noticed the flowers. A bright, almost garish bouquet sitting right there on my porch. My stomach tightened as I picked them up, fingers brushing against the note tied to the stems.\n\n*\u201cWith love, From Jay and Harleen.\u201d*\n\nMy heart dropped, thudding hard enough to make my chest ache. It\u2019s them. How did they know where I live? Fear crept in, cold and heavy, but underneath it\u2014just a flicker\u2014was something else. Something I didn\u2019t expect.\n\nGrim excitement.\n\nBefore the clowns, before the bloody kid in the alley, life was... nothing. A dull, endless loop.\n\nI was the guy no one noticed. No friends, no dates, no texts blowing up my phone. Just me. Always me. School was\u2014elementary, high school, college\u2014the same story. I showed up, did what I had to do, and left. Nobody cared, and honestly, neither did I.\n\nWork wasn\u2019t any different. I buried myself in the job, pushing meds no one really needed. People came and went, and I just stayed. Invisible. I told myself it didn\u2019t matter. Making friends? Not my thing. Social skills? Forget it.\n\nDays melted into weeks, weeks into years. 30 years spent the same way: selling pills, scarfing down junk food, and going to bed. It was easy, predictable, and dead quiet.\n\nNow I\u2019ve got flowers I didn\u2019t ask for. From people I never want to see again. And somehow, for the first time in years, I laughed. Not because it was funny\u2014because it was ridiculous. Being stalked by clowns? What even is my life right now?\n\nI didn\u2019t know what else to do, so I called the cops. Told them about *\u201cJay-Jay and Harleen.\u201d* They didn\u2019t take me seriously, not really, but they did tell me to be careful.\n\nApparently, there\u2019s been talk about a pair of serial killers in town. No solid evidence, though\u2014just whispers and rumors. Great. Just what I needed to hear.\n\nThe decision was easy: I had to get out. I started scraping together every penny I could, cutting back on everything. No more takeout, no more late-night snacks, just instant noodles and black coffee. My savings grew, slowly but steadily.\n\nBut tonight, hunger got the better of me. My stomach growled like it was fighting back against the plan. I grabbed my jacket and headed to the convenience store down the street.\n\nThe fluorescent lights buzzed overhead as I wandered the aisles, tossing a sandwich and a bag of chips into my basket. I paid, stuffed the food into my jacket, and stepped out into the cold night.\n\nThat\u2019s when I heard it\u2026 a faint shuffle behind me.\n\nBefore I could turn, something hard smashed into the back of my skull. Pain shot through my head, bright and sharp, and then everything went black.\n\nI woke up in some basement, tied to a chair. My head throbbed, my vision fuzzy, but I didn\u2019t panic. I didn\u2019t gasp or scream. I just focused on figuring out how the hell to get out of this.\n\nThen, I heard footsteps. Down the stairs, here came the Comedian and his girlfriend, looking like they stepped out of some twisted circus.\n\n*\u201cWhy so serious?\u201d* He mocks me.\n\nThe ropes bite into my wrists, the chair creaking under my weight as he leans closer.\u00a0\n\n*\u201cSmile,\u201d* he says, his words oozing like a command I can\u2019t follow.\n\nI shook my head, feeling the weight of their eyes.\n\n*\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d* the Comedian said, his grin spreading wider. *\u201cBecause we\u2019re about to put on a show for you.\u201d*\n\nThe joker and his harlequin of a girlfriend started their little act, bouncing around like they were in some cheesy comedy show. The *\u201cjokes\u201d* they were throwing out were awkward and cringe, not even close to being funny. I could barely stomach it.\n\nTheir laughter rang through the basement like they thought they were killing it, but I wasn\u2019t amused. This wasn\u2019t comedy. It felt more like they were trying to break me with their stupidity. Every over-the-top gesture and every forced punchline made my skin crawl.\n\nIs this their idea of torture?\n\nThen, they pulled out knives, and the real \u201cshow\u201d was about to start. The Comedian\u2019s grin widened like he\u2019d been waiting for this moment.\n\n*\u201cTime to make you smile,\u201d* he said, his voice sickeningly sweet.\n\nI knew what was coming. They didn\u2019t need to say it. The knives gleamed under the dim light, sharp and ready. They were going to carve into my face like a pumpkin and twist it into some grotesque, bleeding smile.\n\nI tried not to think about it, but the thought crawled under my skin. They were going to make me grin, whether I wanted to or not.\n\nI closed my eyes for a second, just to block out the nightmare, and deep down, I prayed. I prayed for someone\u2026 anyone\u2026 to pull me out of this hell, but nothing came.\n\nThen I felt it. The cold steel of the woman\u2019s knife scraped against my skin, and before I could react, it cut deep into my cheek. The pain exploded through me, sharp and fiery, and I couldn\u2019t stop the scream that tore out of my throat.\n\nThe Comedian just stood there, arms wide, savoring every second of my suffering like he was at a show. He watched me squirm, his twisted grin stretching even wider.\n\nJust when I thought I couldn\u2019t take it anymore, it happened. A crash\u2014loud enough to shake the walls. The door to the basement flew off its hinges, splintering into pieces as something massive stepped through.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t human. Not even close. This thing was huge, its form more **bat** than **man**, with wings spread wide and dark, leathery skin stretched tight over powerful muscles.\n\nThe Comedian and his harlequin froze, their twisted smiles faltering as they turned to face the new arrival. But me? I couldn\u2019t do anything but watch as my so-called savior, this monstrous demon, stood between me and my tormentors.\n\nThe bat demon snarled, its wings flapping hard enough to send a gust of wind through the basement. With a roar, it lunged at the Comedian, its claws swiping through the air. The Comedian barely dodged, his laugh turning into a panicked shout as he scrambled backward, his bat raised in defense.\n\nThe harlequin wasn\u2019t much better off. She swung her knife, aiming for the demon\u2019s throat, but it was like trying to stab through stone. The bat demon swatted her aside like she was nothing, sending her crashing into the wall with a sickening thud.\n\nThe Comedian retaliated, swinging his crowbar with wild abandon. The bat demon caught it mid-swing, crushing the wood in its grip before tossing the Comedian across the room like a ragdoll.\n\nAs chaos erupted, I saw him\u2014 the kid from earlier. The one who\u2019d warned me to run. He stepped through the wreckage, wearing a robin-like costume, his eyes scanning the scene with quick, practiced focus.\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked, his voice surprisingly calm, considering the madness around us.\n\nI shook my head, too disoriented to form words.\n\nThe kid nodded, his expression softening.\u00a0\n\n*\u201cI\u2019m taking you to the hospital,\u201d* he said, his tone leaving no room for argument.\n\nHe reached out, pulling me up, and though my legs felt like jelly, I managed to stay on my feet. The bat demon and the clowns were still tearing each other apart, but the kid didn\u2019t flinch, moving with purpose as he guided me toward the door.\n\nThe next thing I knew, I was in a hospital, the smell of antiseptic and the steady beeping of machines filling the quiet. I don\u2019t remember much after the kid pulled me out of that hellhole, but I woke up safe, the chaos and pain just a distant memory now.\n\nA few days later, I got an anonymous letter. It was short, to the point.\n\n*\"You\u2019re safe. Don\u2019t worry about the clowns any more.\"*\n\nThat was it. No name, no explanation. Just those words.\n\nMonths have passed, and the scar on my cheek is healing. It\u2019s still there, a permanent reminder of everything, but it doesn\u2019t hurt anymore. I try not to think about it, not to look back. It\u2019s in the past.\n\nI\u2019ve heard the rumors. People say the clowns are still out there, still on the run. Maybe it\u2019s true. Maybe not. I try not to care. It\u2019s just a whisper now, fading away into the noise of the world. I hope it stays that way.\n\nI was once stalked by a comedian who laughed at his own jokes.\n\n*\u201cWhy so serious?\u201d* He mocks me.\n\nThe ropes bite into my wrists, the chair creaking under my weight as he leans closer.\u00a0\n\n*\u201cSmile,\u201d* he says, his words oozing like a command I can\u2019t follow.\n\nI can\u2019t forget his face\u2014skin pale, almost sickly, with a yellowish tint. Black streaks curve from the corners of his mouth, an exaggerated grin like something from a twisted children\u2019s book. His eyes shine with something that isn\u2019t humor.\n\nWhy me?

He watched me squirm, his twisted grin stretching even wider.\n\nJust when I thought I couldn\u2019t take it anymore, it happened. A crash\u2014loud enough to shake the walls. The door to the basement flew off its hinges, splintering into pieces as something massive stepped through.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t human. Not even close. This thing was huge, its form more **bat** than **man**, with wings spread wide and dark, leathery skin stretched tight over powerful muscles.\n\nThe Comedian and his harlequin froze, their twisted smiles faltering as they turned to face the new arrival. But me? I couldn\u2019t do anything but watch as my so-called savior, this monstrous demon, stood between me and my tormentors.\n\nThe bat demon snarled, its wings flapping hard enough to send a gust of wind through the basement. With a roar, it lunged at the Comedian, its claws swiping through the air. The Comedian barely dodged, his laugh turning into a panicked shout as he scrambled backward, his bat raised in defense.\n\nThe harlequin wasn\u2019t much better off. She swung her knife, aiming for the demon\u2019s throat, but it was like trying to stab through stone. The bat demon swatted her aside like she was nothing, sending her crashing into the wall with a sickening thud.\n\nThe Comedian retaliated, swinging his crowbar with wild abandon. The bat demon caught it mid-swing, crushing the wood in its grip before tossing the Comedian across the room like a ragdoll.\n\nAs chaos erupted, I saw him\u2014 the kid from earlier. The one who\u2019d warned me to run. He stepped through the wreckage, wearing a robin-like costume, his eyes scanning the scene with quick, practiced focus.\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked, his voice surprisingly calm, considering the madness around us.\n\nI shook my head, too disoriented to form words.\n\nThe kid nodded, his expression softening.\u00a0\n\n*\u201cI\u2019m taking you to the hospital,\u201d* he said, his tone leaving no room for argument.\n\nHe reached out, pulling me up, and though my legs felt like jelly, I managed to stay on my feet. The bat demon and the clowns were still tearing each other apart, but the kid didn\u2019t flinch, moving with purpose as he guided me toward the door.\n\nThe next thing I knew, I was in a hospital, the smell of antiseptic and the steady beeping of machines filling the quiet. I don\u2019t remember much after the kid pulled me out of that hellhole, but I woke up safe, the chaos and pain just a distant memory now.\n\nA few days later, I got an anonymous letter. It was short, to the point.\n\n*\"You\u2019re safe. Don\u2019t worry about the clowns any more.\"*\n\nThat was it. No name, no explanation. Just those words.\n\nMonths have passed, and the scar on my cheek is healing. It\u2019s still there, a permanent reminder of everything, but it doesn\u2019t hurt anymore. I try not to think about it, not to look back. It\u2019s in the past.\n\nI\u2019ve heard the rumors. People say the clowns are still out there, still on the run. Maybe it\u2019s true. Maybe not. I try not to care. It\u2019s just a whisper now, fading away into the noise of the world. I hope it stays that way."},"45":{"title":"I Played Mirror Game","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1i4s469\/i_played_mirror_game\/","flair":"Story","author":"dlschindler","selftext":"\"What's Bloody Mary?\" I asked, and that was the exact moment when things started to go wrong in my life. I'd always lived a charmed life, but nothing on me could protect me from what is out there. It's in the darkness, in the glass, like looking out of a window into the night, and something is in the distance, in the sky, something is out there.\n\nWhat happened to me, how I got this way, that's knowing what that something is. You don't want to know what it is. If you don't know, you can continue with life, and you'll be fine.\n\nSomeone told me this is called \"information hazard\"; I must warn you that you don't want to know what happened to me.\n\n\"It is a game. Just a game.\" Lisle laughed at me, seeing that I looked worried.\n\n\"A game involving mirrors?\" I asked. Mirrors frighten me. I don't like how I look, my face is uneven, I'm not pretty. I've just always hated mirrors.\n\n\"That's right, Canda. If you win, you won't be afraid of anything anymore. Imagine that.\" Lisle said with a promise in her voice. I shuddered, realizing that fear had kept me from nearly everything I could accomplish. Nothing bad ever happens to me, I always have what I need, like having a best friend like Lisle. But I stay in place, and I never move forward, I am afraid of the mirror and I am afraid of change.\n\n\"This game, it is scary?\" I asked.\n\nLisle nodded. \"My brother taught it to me, but I never played.\"\n\nI trembled in trepidation at the thought of Thomas. He was the State Hospital in the psychiatric ward. I worried the mirror game was the same thing that put him there.\n\n\"I don't know, Lisle, it sounds dangerous.\"\n\n\"All you do is go into the bathroom alone and turn off the lights and cup your hands around your eyes against the mirror: like this.\" Lisle made goggles around her eyes with her hands and pressed them against the mirror in her room. \"And then you whisper her name while staring into the inky void within the mirror, you say it three times, or more.\"\n\n\"Her name is Bloody Mary?\" I asked. I didn't want to do it. I got on my phone and checked to see if it was a real thing. \"It says here you're supposed to use a candle and spin in circles and it says nothing about putting your hands between the mirror and your face.\"\n\n\"There's the real way to do it and then there's the fake ways to do it.\" Lisle shrugged. \"Imagine having a slumber party and being the only girl who actually does it. The rest just pretend they did it.\"\n\n\"Nobody ever really does it?\" I asked.\n\n\"Thomas did.\" Lisle said strangely.\n\n\"Then it's real. Let's not do it. I'm not doing it. Don't do it, Lisle.\" I said.\n\n\"So, you actually believe in - that ghosts and demons and stuff are real?\" Lisle asked me incredulously.\n\n\"No.\" I said honestly. I didn't believe in any of that stuff.\n\n\"Then it just builds confidence, and girl, that's what you need!\" Lisle assured me. \"I'll go first, and I'm going to do it for reelzeez.\"\n\nI sat there feeling weirdly calm, the same way I get when I am about to get a shot or take a test or see a large dog with no owner walking towards me on the street. Nothing bad ever happens to me, so I don't really get all that scared or freaked out, I just get this weird calm feeling. It's a kind of fear, a sort of creeping, unidentifiable fear with no basis on what I am facing, just the instinct of a threat.\n\nHer bedroom was across the hall from the bathroom.\n\nLisle went into the bathroom and turned off the lights. I listened, but I couldn't hear her saying 'Bloody Mary' or whispering it. A few seconds after she went in she came out with a big grin on her face and told me it was fine. I didn't believe she had actually done it, but I didn't want to call her out.\n\n\"Your turn.\" She told me.\n\n\"I already said I wasn't going to do it. I told you not to.\" I crossed my arms, feeling nervous. I knew I had to go in there, to prove to myself I wasn't afraid. I wasn't sure why I was so hesitant to go in there. The fact is, I was terrified that it might be real.\n\n\"That's fine.\" Lisle shrugged and hopped onto her bed and put on her headphones making a point of ignoring me. I need her approval, it's part of having a best friend, so I give in to her demands. I gave up, got up and went in.\n\nAlone in the bathroom I asked myself if I was going to do it. I don't think anyone ever really does it, I think they laugh at it and treat mirror game like a joke, but it proves to yourself who you really are. Do you believe in ghosts? I ask myself such a question, and I'd have said 'no'. Then I put myself in a test against an ancient demon, and learn that fear is our first defense against things we should not know about.\n\nIn the mirror, in the dark. Something isn't right. Something is in there, floating in a darkness - a distant something, coming closer. Will I wait for her? She approaches, from deep within the mirror. Locked into staring at her, I don't look away.\n\nIf I look away, I admit she is real, I admit I am afraid. Just a speck in the ink, the light of her image reflecting in my eyes, reflected in the mirror, and it is all darkness. Just this black void, consuming me, rooting me to the spot, gripping me in terror.\n\nShe is there, she is real. She is in front of me, she is behind me. She is behind you in the darkness, in the corner of the room. Not the floor, look up, she is there. When you look she is gone, but the darkness remains, the shadow looms.\n\nShe groans next to my ear as I lay on my side in bed, a kind of deep creaking noise, like she is a chorus of toads. She touches me in the darkness, her hand as cold as ice. I'd scream but I bite into my own tongue out of panic, tasting the blood.\n\nWhere am I? Still trapped in that darkness, that silhouette of a nightmare coming ever closer as I watch, hands cupped between my eyes and the mirror? Did I spit blood all over the mirror when I first bit my tongue?\n\nThe pain is sharp and jagged, and familiar. I did bite my tongue when she came. And I did it again when she touched me, in the darkness, alone in my bedroom.\n\nI see her moving across the floor, silently approaching me, my nightlight shows me the horror of her ragged visage. She is not of this world, she never was. What we are, we are just creatures who are here right now. She is always, she was always here.\n\nThis I suddenly know, by instinct. What does Thomas know? I'd go ask him, but they wouldn't let me out of my room. It is dark in there, and she comes to me and sits with me and I slowly turn around and around in circles.\n\nThey let me back out. I am here, I am there. I go home, but that moment,\n\n\"What's Bloody Mary?\" haunts me.\n\nWhen I look at her face, I see nothing. She has no face, there is nothing there. She is looking at me, I can feel it. She is looking at you, too, but you cannot feel it.\n\nWhatever you do, don't look back.\n\nDon't play mirror game."},"46":{"title":"Help me find this fanfic pls","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1hxhr7j\/help_me_find_this_fanfic_pls\/","flair":"Story","author":"throwawaygalsa","selftext":"Been on a nostalga trip lately and trying to revisit old stories.

Some truths should stay buried in the dark corners of our minds, locked away where they can't infect others. But after what I discovered about this killer that many dreamed - The Hunted, I feel obligated to warn others. Maybe then the families that suffered can find some closure.\n\n\n What I'm about to share will haunt you as much as it haunted me.\n\n\nI'm a detective in rural Montana, and for the past eight months, I've been investigating a series of disappearances along the remote stretches of Skalkaho Highway. At first, they didn't connect. just some people being stupid, forgetting to mark their way back. \n\n\nBut soon, I realized the patterns.\nThe victims always vanished near dawn or dusk. Their vehicles would be found intact, sometimes still running, as if they'd just stepped out for a moment. No signs of struggle. No blood, No bodies. \nJust more dead ends and questions that kept me awake.\n\n\nENTRY 2\n\n\nI can't believe we almost dismissed the case, if it wasn't for the cameras we put that case would have been lost.\n\n\n\n\nA forest service worker found something strange while checking trail cameras last October. The images showed a blue Ford F-150 appearing in different remote locations over several months, always in the pre-dawn hours. The truck was distinctive \u2013 rusted hood, missing rear bumper, and a gun rack visible through the back window. \n\n\nI ran the plates. The truck belonged to Daniel Hudson, no fixed address. His record was clean except for a single hunting violation from three years ago. But something about his DMV photo made my skin crawl. His eyes held no light, no warmth \u2013 just the flat, dead stare with a warm smile. It unsettled me for some reason.\n\n\nENTRY 3\n\n\nDeep in the Bitterroot National Forest, miles from any marked trail, we discovered bodies, hanging from ropes. The first tree stood alone in a small clearing.\n\n\nI've been a detective for fifteen years, seeing things that would break most people. What I saw, hanging from those branches.\n\n\nI still can't sleep to this day without dreaming of that day. The bodies were strung up like trophies, wrapped in barbed wire that dug too deep into the rotting flesh.\n\n\n They'd been gutted, drained, hung like a sick way to get others' attention.\nEach victim had been \"processed\" with surgical precision\u2026 some, not so lucky.\n\n\nWe found more west of the first, each with its own grotesque display, and disfigurement.\n\n\nThe forensics confirmed what we'd all feared \u2013 all the missing people were there, transformed into a horrible warning to stay away.\n\n\nThe evidence we gathered painted a picture of a man who'd crossed a line most of us can't even imagine. He didn't kill for money, revenge, or any of the usual motives, but to be feared and left alone. To just live\n\n\nENTRY 4\n\n\nWe found a journal in an abandoned hunting cabin, proposed to be the killer's. The entries started normally enough \u2013 observations about weather patterns, animal movements, typical hunter's notes. But they devolved into something else, more personal.\n\n\n\u201c I never meant to become this way!\n\n\n I truly mean it. The hunger started small \u2013 just a growing sensation in my gut that normal food couldn't satisfy.\n I just ignored it at first, living my ordinary life, working my job as a Doctor, across the Midwest. Sleeping in my old truck, feeding the cat I found a week before.\n\n\n But the hunger grew, and with it came whispers.\n\n\nOn a cold night in northern Michigan. I was parked on a remote logging road, trying to save money instead of getting a motel. The moon hung full and heavy through my windshield, casting long shadows through the bare branches. That's when I first heard them \u2013 voices, telling me what I needed to do to survive.\n\n\nI resisted for weeks. Living on the gas station coffee and beef jerky, and some old dinners crappie food.\n\n\n Good coffee though.\n\n\n\n\nBut you can only fight your nature for so long. The hunger was eating me from the inside out, making me imagine things that weren't there, having nightmares none stop.\n\n\n. I lost thirty pounds that month. My reflection showed sunken eyes and skin stretched thin over my cheekbones. I decided to see a doctor, but it didn't help. they'd just give me some pills and threw me out.\n\n\n\n\nI was checking out an abandoned barn for a place to sleep when I found the coil of rusty barbed wire. Something about the way it gleamed in my flashlight beam made my hands shake. The whispers grew louder, and the hunger twisted like a knife in my gut. When a hiker came by asking if I needed help, I couldn't stop myself. The wire felt right in my hands, natural, like it was always meant to be there. I think I blacked out as the next thing I saw I had hung him high in an old oak tree. The hunger subsided for the first time in months. I felt strong but weak, sick almost. \n\n\nThat was three years ago. I'm twenty-six now, and I've learned a lot since then. The barbed wire was crude, amateur. I've refined my methods, learned to use tools that feel like extensions of myself \u2013 compound bows, hunting knives, and a gun. My truck is my home, my hunting blind, my sanctuary. I keep moving, following the backroads and forest trails across state lines, always staying ahead of the questions and missing person reports.\n\n\nI'm not proud of what I do, but I've accepted it. This isn't about violence or cruelty \u2013 it's about survival. My survival from whatever is out there.\n\n\nThe authorities don't understand, of course. They're looking for someone driven by rage or vengeance, but they're wrong. I'm driven by something I can't even comprehend, something evil. \n\n\nI'm just doing it because I hope one day it will stop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've gotten better at choosing my hunting grounds. State forests, national parks, places where people go to \"find themselves.\" They never expect someone like me, someone who looks as normal as their neighbor or coworker. I keep my truck clean, my clothes neat. I pay for gas with cash and never stay in one place long enough to draw attention. The only evidence I leave behind are my tributes \u2013 my kills, strung up in the trees, a reminder that I'm not their friend.\n\n\n\n\nThe hunger is starting to grow again. It's been almost two weeks since my last hunt, and I can feel the familiar hollowness spreading through my brain. The whispers are getting louder, more insistent. They tell me it's time to move on, to find new hunting grounds. Tomorrow I'll head west, toward the vast forests of Oregon. \n\n\n\n\nSometimes, in the quiet hours before dawn, I wonder if there is an escape from this, a way out of this torture. I'm driven by the same voices. I see signs occasionally \u2013 strange markings on trees, missing persons cases that feel familiar, stories traded in hushed voices at rural bars. \n\n\nMaybe someday our paths will cross, and I'll finally understand why it's following me.\nBut for now, I'll try to fight it and it's power, whatever it is. The moon is waning, but I can still feel its pull. The hunger grows stronger with each passing day, and the whispers tell me I'm getting closer to catching whatever it is\u2026 something I don't want to know. \n\n\nMy bow rests on the passenger seat, my knives tucked safely under the driver's seat. Bloodstained.\n\n\nI am not a killer\u2026  though some call me one \u2013 I was born to be a doctor\u2026 not a hunter, chosen by whatever dark force that ruled the spaces between civilization and wilderness.\n\n\n But let me get this straight. I don't kill for pleasure or sport. I kill because if I don't, the hunger will consume me from the inside out, leaving nothing but an empty shell behind. A real monster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomewhere ahead, someone is hiking the lonely trail or possibly setting up camp in the growing darkness. The whispers came, telling me that it's just life, to kill.\nand the whispers were right.\n\n\nThis is my story, my confession, my truth. If you're reading this, pray we never meet. Pray that I won't find you.\n\n\n Because once I do, there's no going back to the familiar warmth of your family, and friends. There's only death ahead\u201c\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've been tracking this killer for months now. The blue F-150 has been spotted in three different states, always near where people go missing. Always near where we later find the body's, hung in trees. \n\n\n\u2013 his preferred weapons are hunting knives and a compound bow. More surprising, he wrote a note left at his last scene.\n\n\n\u201c You're wasting your time \u201c\n\n\nBut there's nothing fair about what he does. He treats people like game animals, tracking them for days before making his move. The forensic evidence suggests he sometimes follows his targets for over a week, learning their patterns, waiting for the perfect moment. Like a hunter studying prey.\n\n\nThe most terrifying part? We're no closer to catching him than we were when we started. He moves like a ghost through the wilderness, leaving no traces except his grisly displays. The profilers say he's organized, methodical, and completely detached from human emotion. They say he is guided by something.\n\n\nI know he's still out there, watching from the shadows, waiting for his next victim. Sometimes, on long nights when the wind howls through the trees, I wonder if he's watching me too. If I'm just another potential trophy for his collection.\n\n\nSo consider this a warning. If you're traveling through the remote parts of the Northwest and you see a blue F-150 with a rusted hood, don't stop. Don't make eye contact. Just drive, and keep driving until you're back in civilization. Because the man is still hunting, not a friend, and to him, we're all just prey waiting to be strung up as a warning.\n\n\nThe most disturbing part? Deep down, I'm starting to think he's right about one thing \u2013 he's not human anymore. Whatever He used to be, died long ago, replaced by something that only looks human from a distance. Something that needs to kill to keep its heart beating.\n\n\nAnd somewhere out there, under a moon, he's watching. Waiting. Hungry.\n"},"48":{"title":"I discovered something in biology class... it doesn't belong on Earth...","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1hs0l58\/i_discovered_something_in_biology_class_it_doesnt\/","flair":"Story","author":"Upset_Space1082","selftext":"The Specimen (original creepypasta by me)\n\n[Re uploaded audio narration on my youtube](https:\/\/youtu.be\/f8CoZ-m2DlM?si=hB-mO5X-J-eANWxf\n)\n\nThis is a story about something i encountered in my biology class... It should not be on this planet.\n\nI didn\u2019t mean for it to happen. It was supposed to be a simple research project, something to pad my resume before graduation. But now, as I sit here in this sterile laboratory, fluorescent lights flickering above me, I realize I\u2019ve unleashed something I cannot control. And it knows.\n\nI guess I should start from the beginning. My name is Mark Keaton, and I\u2019m a senior biology major at Crestwood University. I\u2019m not a standout student, not one of those prodigies who gets published in Nature while still in undergrad. I\u2019m the guy who scrapes by with a 3.2 GPA, more interested in weekend beer pong tournaments than lab hours. But I wanted to change that. Grad schools aren\u2019t impressed by mediocrity.\n\nSo, when Dr. Amelia Quinn, my molecular biology professor, announced an opportunity to assist her with a side project, I jumped at the chance. Dr. Quinn wasn\u2019t just a professor; she was a rockstar in the field. If I could get a recommendation from her, it would be my golden ticket.\n\nThe project seemed mundane at first. We were cataloging microorganisms in the soil around Crestwood\u2019s expansive forest reserve. The area was a hotspot for biodiversity, and Dr. Quinn was interested in finding previously undocumented microbes. Nothing glamorous. just collecting samples, isolating bacteria, running tests.\n\nIt was during one of these fieldwork sessions that I found it...\n\n\n\n\nThe forest was quiet that day, eerily so. No birdsong, no rustle of leaves in the breeze. Just the crunch of my boots on the damp earth. I was supposed to collect samples from a streambed a mile into the woods, an area untouched by human interference.\n\nThe stream was barely a trickle, winding its way through moss-covered rocks and gnarled roots. I knelt by the water\u2019s edge, scooping soil into a sterile container. That\u2019s when I noticed something unusual.\n\nAt first, I thought it was just a strange rock, half buried in the mud. But as I brushed away the dirt, I realized it wasn\u2019t a rock at all. It was smooth, almost glass-like, and faintly translucent. It pulsed.\n\nNot like a heartbeat, exactly, but there was a rhythm to it, a faint throbbing that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end.\n\nI hesitated. Every instinct told me to leave it alone, to pretend I hadn\u2019t seen it. But curiosity is a dangerous thing, and I was desperate to impress Dr. Quinn.\n\n\nUsing a pair of tweezers, I carefully pried it from the soil. It was surprisingly light, no larger than a golf ball, and warm to the touch through my gloves. As I held it up to the light, I saw something moving inside. a swirling, dark mass. like ink in water.\n\nI sealed it in a sample jar, labeled it, and stuffed it into my backpack.\n\n\n\nBack at the lab, I decided to keep it to myself for the time being. I told myself I wanted to run preliminary tests before presenting it to Dr. Quinn, but deep down, I think I was afraid she\u2019d take it away from me.\n\nThe first thing I did was examine it under a dissecting microscope. Up close, the surface was even stranger. intricate, fractal like patterns that seemed to shift when I looked away, as if the object didn\u2019t want to be observed too closely.\n\nThe dark mass inside wasn\u2019t ink. It was alive. It moved with purpose, coiling and uncoiling like a snake trapped in glass.\n\nI decided to run a DNA analysis. The process was routine. extract a small sample, amplify the genetic material using PCR, and compare the sequence to known organisms. But the results were anything but routine.\n\nIt didn\u2019t match anything. Not bacteria, not fungi, not even archaea. Its genetic structure wasn\u2019t just unknown. it was impossible. The sequences didn\u2019t follow the rules of earthly biology. No ATCG bases, no codons, no proteins as we understood them.\n\nI should have stopped there. I should have gone to Dr. Quinn, or hell, even the government. But instead, I kept digging.\n\n\n\nI fed it.\n\nAt first, I wasn\u2019t sure what it ate. I placed it in a petri dish with various nutrient mediums... glucose, amino acids, lipids... but it didn\u2019t react to any of them. Then, as a last resort, I pricked my finger with a sterile needle and let a single drop of blood fall onto the dish.\n\nThe response was immediate. The dark mass inside the object surged toward the edge of its container, pressing against the glass as if it could sense me. I watched, horrified and fascinated, as the blood was absorbed through the surface.\n\nIt grew.\n\nNot much, just a few millimeters, but enough to notice. The patterns on its surface became more intricate, almost hypnotic. And the pulsing grew stronger.\n\nI started having nightmares.\n\nThey weren\u2019t like normal dreams. They felt\u2026 invasive, as if something was burrowing into my mind. I saw flashes of alien landscapes. towering black spires under a blood-red sky, oceans of writhing, serpentine creatures. And always, at the center of it all, was the object, pulsating like a malignant heart.\n\nI stopped sleeping. I stopped eating. My days became a blur of lab work and frantic notes. The object consumed me, in more ways than one.\n\n\nThings escalated two weeks later.\n\nI came into the lab one morning to find the containment jar shattered. The object was gone.\n\nPanic set in immediately. I tore the lab apart, searching every corner, but it was nowhere to be found. That\u2019s when I noticed the trail.\n\nA thin, glistening residue led from the shattered jar to the air vent near the floor. It had escaped.\n\nI should have evacuated the building, called security, anything. But I didn\u2019t. I told myself I could handle it, that it was my responsibility.\n\nI followed the trail.\n\nThe residue led out of the lab, down the hallway, and into the basement\u2014a part of the building that was rarely used. The air grew colder as I descended, the fluorescent lights above me flickering ominously.\n\nThe trail ended at a storage room.\n\nThe door was ajar, creaking slightly as I pushed it open. The room was dark, the only light coming from a flickering bulb overhead. And there, in the center of the room, was the object.\n\nOr at least, what it had become.\n\nIt was no longer small and contained. It had grown, now the size of a basketball, its surface pulsating violently. Tendrils extended from it, writhing like the limbs of some grotesque sea creature. The dark mass inside had expanded, taking on a more defined shape. something vaguely humanoid, but wrong.\n\nIt turned toward me.\n\nI don\u2019t know how else to describe it. It didn\u2019t have eyes, but I felt its gaze, cold and calculating.\n\nAnd then it spoke.\n\nNot in words, but in my mind. A voice that wasn\u2019t a voice, a torrent of alien thoughts that threatened to overwhelm me.\n\n\u201cYOU BROUGHT ME HERE.\u201d\n\nI stumbled back, my head pounding. It took a step forward. or maybe it was a lunge; its movements were unnatural, jerky and fluid at the same time.\n\n\u201cYOU WILL SUSTAIN ME.\u201d\n\nThat was when I ran.\n\nI don\u2019t remember much after that. I think I blacked out at some point, collapsing in a stairwell. When I came to, the building was in chaos. Sirens blared, and the air was thick with smoke.\n\nCampus security found me and dragged me outside. They told me there had been a chemical spill, that the lab was being evacuated as a precaution.\n\nBut I knew the truth. It wasn\u2019t a chemical spill. It was loose.\n\nThat was three days ago. I\u2019ve been holed up in my apartment ever since, afraid to leave, afraid to sleep. It\u2019s in my head, whispering to me, showing me things I can\u2019t unsee.\n\nI don\u2019t know what it wants, but I know it isn\u2019t done with me.\n\nAs I write this, I can feel it watching, waiting. The patterns on my skin. intricate, fractal-like. are spreading.\n\nI think it\u2019s using me.\n\nIf you find this, please, burn it. Burn everything. Don\u2019t let it spread.\n\nAnd whatever you do, don\u2019t go into the woods.\n\n\n\nThat was three days ago. I\u2019ve been holed up in my apartment ever since, trying to drown out the whispers and the growing hunger clawing at my insides. The object, no, the thing, isn\u2019t just in my head. It\u2019s inside me.\n\nThe patterns spreading across my skin have deepened, like glowing scars etched into my flesh. They move when I don\u2019t look, shifting subtly, forming symbols I can\u2019t decipher. I\u2019ve tried everything. soap, bleach, even slicing into the patterns with a kitchen knife. But they don\u2019t bleed, and they don\u2019t stop growing.\n\nI thought isolation would help, that if I kept to myself, I could contain whatever\u2019s happening. But the whispers grow louder the longer I\u2019m alone. They don\u2019t just speak anymore; they show me things.\n\nAlien landscapes flash behind my closed eyes when I try to sleep. A red sky churns with storms of black lightning. Towering spires pierce the horizon, their surfaces alive with slithering patterns. At the center of it all is the object\u2014or something larger, more horrific\u2014pulsing like a malignant heart.\n\n\u201cBRING ME THE OTHERS!\" the whispers demand.\n\nI\u2019ve stopped sleeping. Every time I close my eyes, I feel the weight of its gaze. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s paranoia or something worse, but I swear I hear something crawling inside the walls, moving in the shadows. I\u2019m afraid to leave, but I\u2019m even more afraid to stay.\n\n\nOn the fourth day, I ventured out, desperate for answers. Crestwood University\u2019s library was mostly empty, and I hoped it would offer some clarity. Maybe some obscure journal or textbook could explain what I\u2019d unleashed.\n\nAs I searched the stacks, the whispers grew agitated. They directed my attention to a student sitting a few tables away, headphones in, oblivious.\n\n\u201cHER!\u201d the voice hissed.\n\nI gritted my teeth and ignored it, flipping through an old biology text. But the hunger clawed at me, a deep, primal urge that wasn\u2019t mine. The patterns on my skin flared under my hoodie, searing with heat.\n\n\u201cBRING HER TO ME!.\u201d\n\nI slammed the book shut and fled, the whispers howling in rage.\n\n\nThat night, the hunger became unbearable. My reflection in the bathroom mirror wasn\u2019t mine anymore. My pupils were elongated, my teeth sharper, my skin glowing faintly in the dark.\n\nThe whispers taunted me.\n\n\u201cYOU CANNOT FIGHT THIS. YOU ARE THE VESSEL.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know how long I stared into the mirror before I noticed the movement behind me. A shadow, darker than the room itself, slithered along the ceiling. It coalesced into a shape a humanoid figure, its limbs impossibly long, its surface writhing with the same fractal patterns as my skin.\n\n\u201cYOU WILL OBEY.\u201d\n\nIt surged toward me, and I screamed, shattering the mirror with my fists. But when I turned, the shadow was gone.\n\nOn the fifth day, I decided to leave Crestwood. My apartment felt like a tomb, and the forest was calling to me.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to go back, but something deeper than thought urged me toward the streambed. It wasn\u2019t the whispers this time. It was the thing inside me, pulling me like a marionette on invisible strings.\n\nThe forest was unrecognizable. The trees seemed taller, their branches intertwining to blot out the sky. The air was heavy, oppressive, and the ground squirmed beneath my feet as if alive.\n\nWhen I reached the streambed, I found it, or rather, what it had become.\n\nThe object was no longer small or contained. It had grown into a massive, pulsating mass of tendrils and shifting patterns. At its center was the dark core, no longer vague or formless. It was humanoid now, its outline grotesque and alien.\n\n\u201cYOU HAVE RETURNED!\u201d it said, though its voice wasn\u2019t audible. It resonated in my bones, a low, grinding hum that made my teeth ache.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026 I didn\u2019t mean to!\u201d\n\n\u201cYOU FED ME. YOU BROUGHT ME HERE. NOW, YOU WILL FINISH WHAT YOU STARTED!\"\n\nBefore I could run, its tendrils lashed out, wrapping around my arms and legs. They burned like fire, fusing to my skin, pulling me closer. I screamed, but the sound was swallowed by the thing\u2019s pulsating mass.\n\n\nWhen I woke, I wasn\u2019t in the forest.\n\nThe sky above me churned with blood-red clouds, streaked with black lightning. The ground beneath me pulsed with movement, covered in the same writhing patterns now etched into my flesh.\n\nI wasn\u2019t alone.\n\nThe spires I\u2019d seen in my visions loomed in the distance, and between them slithered countless creatures. Some were massive, their forms impossible to describe. Others were smaller, humanoid but warped, their bodies a grotesque fusion of flesh and fractal.\n\nThey turned to look at me, their eyes. or whatever they used to see, gleaming with recognition.\n\n\u201cWELCOME HOME,\u201d they said in unison.\n\nI stumbled backward, but there was nowhere to go. The ground itself rose to meet me, wrapping around my legs, pulling me down. The patterns on my skin flared, and I realized with horror that they were connecting me to this place.\n\nI was becoming one of them.\n\n\u201cTHIS IS YOUR PURPOSE,\u201d the whispers said, no longer angry but triumphant.\n\nAs my body dissolved into the fractal landscape, I understood. The thing I\u2019d brought to Earth wasn\u2019t just a life form. It was a gateway, a seed meant to take root and spread.\n\nAnd I had been its caretaker.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this, it\u2019s already too late. The forest is the entry point. Stay away. Burn it if you can. But even fire might not be enough.\n\nThey\u2019re coming.\n\n"},"49":{"title":"The jackpot that ruined my life","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1hrrpoe\/the_jackpot_that_ruined_my_life\/","flair":"Story","author":"Upset_Space1082","selftext":"The Jackpot That Ruined My Life\n\n[The narrated version is uploaded to my youtube.](https:\/\/youtu.be\/XVKqqekvaB8?si=ny5TyTcLI7rWYMXN) I've just started with that so any support is super helpfull! \n\n\nWinning the lottery is supposed to be the ultimate dream, right? At least, that\u2019s what I thought until I won it. Now, sitting here alone in the dark, with the echoes of my hollow mansion ringing in my ears, I can only wonder: was it a dream, or a curse? Let me tell you my story, and then maybe you can decide for yourself.\n\nIt started on New Year\u2019s Day. I\u2019d woken up groggy from a night of cheap champagne and pizza with my friends. Just a regular guy, living paycheck to paycheck in a shoebox apartment, I hadn\u2019t even planned to stay up to watch the ball drop. But around 11:50, I remembered the scratch-off lottery tickets someone had given me as a gag Christmas gift. They were lying on the coffee table, half covered by empty beer cans and leftover takeout containers.\n\nI scratched them idly while the countdown blared on TV. The first one? Nothing. The second? A measly $10 prize. But the third, oh, the third changed everything. At first, I thought I was seeing it wrong, maybe still buzzed from the champagne. But I wasn\u2019t. I checked the numbers again, and again. Each time, they matched.\n\n\u201cHoly\u2026 I won?\u201d I muttered aloud, barely able to believe it. My cat, Mittens, meowed lazily from her perch, completely unimpressed. The grand prize was $50 million. Fifty. Million. Dollars.\n\nI\u2019d never won more than a couple of bucks on a scratch-off before, and now here I was, holding a golden ticket that promised to change my life forever. For a moment, I was frozen in disbelief. Then I jumped up and screamed, \u201cI\u2019m rich!\u201d Mittens bolted under the couch in terror.\n\n\n\n\nThe first sign that things weren\u2019t going to go as planned came almost immediately.\n\nI called the lottery office the next morning, shaking with excitement. After some verification, they confirmed that I\u2019d won. But the lady on the phone hesitated. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to stay discreet about this,\u201d she advised, her voice low. \u201cWinning this kind of money\u2026 it can attract a lot of, uh, attention.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t really understand what she meant at the time. I figured she was just talking about greedy relatives or scammers. But as the days went by, her words started to echo ominously in my head.\n\n\n---\n\nThe first few weeks were pure euphoria. I took the lump sum payout, about $30 million after taxes, and quit my crappy office job on the spot. My boss, who\u2019d been riding me for months, didn\u2019t even get a notice. I bought myself a luxury car, a sprawling mansion, and every gadget I\u2019d ever wanted. For once, it felt like I was finally living.\n\nBut even in the midst of my newfound wealth, little things began to nag at me. It started with the calls. At first, it was just the expected flood of \u201ccongratulations\u201d from old acquaintances, distant relatives, and so-called friends who\u2019d fallen off my radar years ago. Then came the strangers, people I\u2019d never met, claiming to be in dire need of money. They sent long, emotional emails and left desperate voicemails begging for help. I ignored them, thinking they\u2019d eventually stop.\n\nThey didn\u2019t.\n\nOne evening, about a month after I\u2019d claimed my prize, I came home to find someone standing in my driveway. It was a middle-aged man, dressed in a tattered coat and holding a crumpled piece of paper.\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he said, stepping toward me as I got out of my car. \u201cMy daughter\u2019s sick. I\u2019ve been trying to contact you. I just need $10,000 to pay for her surgery.\u201d\n\nI froze, my hand hovering over the car door. \u201cHow did you find me?\u201d\n\nHis face twisted into a mixture of anger and desperation. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for games. You\u2019re a millionaire. You can help us. Why won\u2019t you help us?\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t answer. I just got back in my car and called the police. By the time they arrived, the man was gone, but his crumpled note was on the ground. It wasn\u2019t a plea for help. It was a death threat.\n\n\n\n\nAfter that, I started getting paranoid. I hired security for the house and tried to keep a low profile, but the damage was already done. My name and face were plastered all over the news as the lucky winner, and no amount of privacy measures could erase that. People kept showing up, some with sob stories, others with accusations that I owed them money for reasons I couldn\u2019t even comprehend. They camped outside my house, followed me to the grocery store, and even started harassing my family and friends.\n\nBut the worst of it wasn\u2019t the strangers. It was the way my friends started looking at me. At first, they were happy for me, cheering me on as I treated them to dinners and vacations. But over time, their attitudes changed. They stopped inviting me to hang out unless I was footing the bill, and their jokes about my wealth started to feel pointed and bitter.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve changed,\u201d my best friend, Dan, said one night after I refused to lend him $100,000 for a \u201cbusiness investment.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I\u2019ve changed,\u201d I snapped. \u201cI\u2019m not a walking ATM, Dan.\u201d\n\nHe left in a huff, and we haven\u2019t spoken since.\n\n\n\nIt was around this time that the nightmares began. At first, they were vague and disjointed images of strangers breaking into my house, their faces blurred and featureless. But as the weeks went on, they became more vivid. I\u2019d dream of people standing over my bed, whispering my name in the dark. I\u2019d wake up drenched in sweat, convinced that someone was in the room with me.\n\nOne night, I woke up to find the patio door wide open. My security cameras didn\u2019t show anyone coming in or out, but I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I wasn\u2019t alone. I started sleeping with a knife under my pillow, but it didn\u2019t help. The dreams kept coming, and so did the unease.\n\n\n\nThe final straw came about three months after I\u2019d won. By this point, I was barely leaving the house. My once glamorous mansion felt like a prison, its vast, empty rooms echoing with every creak and groan. I was sitting in the living room, staring blankly at the TV, when I heard a knock at the door.\n\nI froze. It was nearly midnight, and I wasn\u2019t expecting anyone. The knock came again, louder this time. Gripping the knife I\u2019d started carrying everywhere, I crept to the window and peered outside.\n\nA man was standing on my porch, his face obscured by the shadow of his hood. He wasn\u2019t moving, just standing there like he was waiting for something. My heart pounded in my chest as I backed away from the window, my hands shaking.\n\n\u201cGo away!\u201d I shouted through the door. \u201cI\u2019m calling the police!\u201d\n\nThere was a long silence. Then, he spoke.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t escape us,\u201d he said, his voice low and menacing. \u201cYou took the money. Now it\u2019s time to pay.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t wait to hear more. I locked myself in the bathroom and called 911. By the time the police arrived, the man was gone, leaving no trace behind.\n\n\n\nThat was two weeks ago, and things have only gotten worse since then. I keep seeing shadows moving in the corners of my vision, hearing faint whispers when I\u2019m alone. My once bright future has turned into a waking nightmare, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I\u2019m being watched.\n\nI tried to give the money away, hoping it would end the madness. I donated millions to charity, gave my family generous gifts, even tried burning some of the cash. But it didn\u2019t help. The whispers didn\u2019t stop, and neither did the feeling of dread that follows me everywhere I go.\n\nLast night, I woke up to find a message scrawled on my bedroom wall in what looked like blood: \u201cIt\u2019s not about the money. It\u2019s about you.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know who, or what, is doing this to me, but I can\u2019t take it anymore. The lottery didn\u2019t make me rich. It ruined my life. And now, as I sit here, writing this with trembling hands, I can only wonder: was winning really just a stroke of luck? Or was it something else entirely?\n\nThe shadows are moving again. I can hear them whispering my name.\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this, and you ever find yourself holding a winning lottery ticket, do yourself a favor. Rip it up. Burn it. Do whatever you have to do to get rid of it. Because some prizes aren\u2019t worth winning.\n\nSome prizes will cost you everything."},"50":{"title":"The thing behind","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1hq6scu\/the_thing_behind\/","flair":"Story","author":"Odd_Mood_3417","selftext":"\n\nOkay, I don't know how to start this... I'm just hoping someone else out there has experienced something similar. I don't even know if I\u2019m *alive* right now. But if you're reading this, then maybe I\u2019m still here. I guess I should start at the beginning.\n\nI was in my second year of college when it started. Nothing special happened, just the usual stress. But then one day, I noticed something weird\u2014something small at first. A feeling. Not like a feeling you get when someone\u2019s looking at you, but more like... like something *was there*.\n\nAt first, I thought it was just exhaustion, or paranoia. I mean, I was balancing schoolwork, a job, a girlfriend, and trying to actually live my life. But then it wouldn\u2019t go away. It kept coming back. Every time I looked over my right shoulder\u2014just for a second, just a quick glance\u2014I saw *nothing*. But I felt it. I felt something right behind me, always just out of sight, like a shadow stuck to my skin. At first, I thought maybe I was just losing it, but then it started to get worse. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t just a feeling anymore. It was like I couldn\u2019t breathe without it being there. I\u2019d walk to class, and the moment I\u2019d turn a corner, I\u2019d feel the air behind me *shift*, like someone just took a step when I did. I would whip around, expecting to see someone, but no one was ever there. Every time, it was empty. And yet... I knew. I *knew* something was behind me.\n\nMy girlfriend started noticing it. My friends noticed. They thought it was funny at first\u2014just me being \u201cjumpy\u201d or \u201cparanoid.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t funny. It was real. I couldn\u2019t explain it, but there was something there, always lingering behind me, just outside of my vision. It was like I was being followed, but not by anyone I could see. \n\nI started doing this weird thing where I\u2019d turn around every few steps. Just to check. I couldn\u2019t stop myself. I had to. But every time I looked, nothing. *Nothing*. \n\nI went to doctors. They said it was paranoia. They said it was stress, maybe even some sort of anxiety disorder. But that wasn\u2019t it. I\u2019m telling you, it wasn\u2019t like any kind of anxiety I\u2019ve ever felt. There was a *presence*. Something cold, always in the corner of my eye. Something waiting. \n\nOne day, I was walking down the hall of my dorm\u2014just another regular day\u2014and I turned a corner. I wasn\u2019t thinking about it. I wasn\u2019t expecting anything. And then I slammed into someone. Just a random student. We both stepped back, said a quick \u201csorry,\u201d and then... then something *shifted*.\n\nI felt it. That cold, suffocating presence. It was right behind me. It wasn\u2019t in my head anymore. I turned around and\u2014 *I swear*\u2014I saw *something*. The hallway, the entire *environment*, changed. The lights flickered. The air felt thick. Like the walls were breathing. And there it was\u2014just at the edge of my vision, like a black figure, just *there*, watching.\n\nI wanted to run. I tried to turn around, to get the hell out of there, but something... something in my chest froze. I couldn\u2019t move. I just stood there, my heart pounding, and I could feel it getting closer. Whatever was behind me. The thing that had been following me for *years*. \n\nI couldn\u2019t turn around. I couldn\u2019t even breathe. But the thing\u2014*whatever it was*\u2014was closer now. I could feel it right at my back. I don\u2019t know how I didn\u2019t break down completely right there, but I somehow managed to backpedal, just one step after another. But the next thing I knew, the hallway... was gone. \n\nI swear to God, I was no longer in the dorm. The lights were dimmer. The walls weren\u2019t the same. They were crumbling, like they were... rotting. The air smelled musty, like old wood and decay. And then I heard it.\n\nFootsteps. Not mine. Someone\u2014or something\u2014was behind me. And I could hear its breath, wet and labored, as it *followed* me. The thing that had been behind me all this time was now right there, just inches away. I turned, but I couldn\u2019t see it. I couldn\u2019t see *anything* except the darkness closing in around me.\n\nI started running, but it didn\u2019t matter. No matter where I went, I couldn\u2019t escape. The walls shifted, bending and twisting, and the house\u2014if you could even call it that\u2014never ended. It was like I was running in a loop, the same rooms, the same hallway, over and over again, until I couldn\u2019t breathe, couldn\u2019t move. \n\nI don\u2019t know how long I was there. I don\u2019t even know if I was *alive* when I finally woke up. All I remember is a *sudden* shift. I was back in my dorm room. The same room I\u2019ve been in for years. But something was different. \n\nIt\u2019s still there. That presence. I feel it now, every single time I look over my shoulder. Every time I walk down the hall, through the campus, anywhere. It\u2019s always there, just waiting. And I can\u2019t outrun it.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever get away. But I have to tell you this, in case someone else knows what I\u2019m talking about. \n\nIf you ever feel it too... if you feel someone behind you, always just out of sight, don\u2019t ignore it. Don\u2019t pretend it\u2019s in your head. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s real.

The chilling breeze whistled past the individuals as the deep snow crunched beneath their feet. Furs and leathers were doubled in layers, thick straps utilized to create a tight fit to block out the cold. \"How much further?\" The young boy asked, chattering his teeth between each word. There was no answer for some time before his uncle stopped and knelt down to face him. \"We are almost on its trail. We have to be careful and silent. If it hears us approaching, we could be next.\" The boy nodded and stifled the fear welling up inside of him. Footsteps continued, and the dog pounced through the snow, occasionally pausing to sniff the air. A strong vortex picked up, and the animal let out a deep growl. It gnashed its teeth towards the flurry of snow that was getting heavier. The group stopped, watching the dogs actions. Hand signals were used. Unfortunately, the boy had no idea what they meant. Soon, a sound crept into their ears. It started off soft, barely a murmur until it reached a crescendo that rivaled the wind. It was laughter. The eerie tone of it sent a chill to run down the boy's spine.\n\nThe chime was hollow and emotionless. It returned in waves of threes. The hair on the dogs back stood up, and it spun towards the group. Foaming saliva rolled from the gleaming teeth, turning to ice from the harsh weather. It barked and then lunged towards the boy. In a flash of quick movements, blood spattered on the fresh snow, followed by the final yelp of the rabid creature. The boy's father stood motionless, still clutching the spear he had used to stop the dog. \"It's here.\" The man spoke without removing his gaze from the animal. The spear was removed, and they continued forward. Waves of laughter returned but more profound this time. The boy was instructed to cover his ears. He did so and followed the adults until they came upon footprints. Large prints of barefeet trudged through frozen layers of dark blood. Drag marks followed each foot as if something was being pulled at each side of the wanderer. Fear bubbled up through the boy, and he shivered. The act was not from the cold but the agonizing terror of the thing they pursued.\n\nMenacing chuckles followed with the wind, and the boy pressed harder against his frigid ears. The sound was muffled but still apparent. He looked down towards his feet, occasionally spying more of those massive bloodied footprints. Before long, he ran into the still frame of his father. No words were spoken or hand gestures utilized. Instead, the boys father grunted and nodded his head. The pulsing heart inside the boy's body skipped a beat when his eyes fell upon what had caused the ceasing of motion. Towards a frost covered boulder, stood a man. Not an ordinary man by any means. This man was deathly thin with pale skin that had an opalescent sheen. Ice crystals covered countless areas of the abrasive flesh along with purple and black splotches of frostbite. Aside from the bits of tattered and rotting furs, the body was exposed to the elements. Long strands of frozen hair dangled in front of a gaunt face. Barely visible through the locks of obsidian were a set of unblinking eyes. Wide and without pupils, the things scanned the white landscape. A crooked smile stretched across cracked, blue lips. A long stream of brown liquid stained the corners and dripped over the jawline. \n\nThe things head looked left, then right before kneeling down. That horrible laugh spewed from the sinister mouth. The thing began to fumble with something at its feet. The three stood there in awe, trying to ascertain what it was doing. Realization took over in the form of the boy gasping. Tears dropped and froze to his skin as he cried at the sight of his dead mother and sister. Their corpses tangled together in a small pool of blood. Their furs had large rips, exposing torn flesh. The most horrific part was there still open eyes, accompanied by the same smile as the thing that took them. The mystery of their fates had been discovered in the worst possible way. Chomping and slurping comensed as the wretched thing began to eat the remnants of the two women. The boy clinched his teeth and tried to hold back the wailing but to no avail. He let out a cry that caught the attention of the emaciated creature. The boy's uncle quickly cupped his mouth. \"Hush. You need to be quiet.\" But it was too late. The creature had stopped its feast and jerked its head forward. Blood oozed from the grinning mouth, and it stood up.\n\nThere was no time to plan, only attack. The boys father let out a war cry and charged towards the thing, spear gripped in both hands. The second adult followed suit after instructing the boy to remain at his spot. The men charged towards the scrawny and menacing ice demin. The charging hastened until all three crashed with a thud. The spear missed its target, the father was knocked back, and the uncle was lifted from the ground with a bony hand. The laughing echoed in the dry air. The creature's free hand rose and spread a set of five abnormally long fingers with deep black nails at the end. The next few moments are blurry due to the child covering his face. But in the end, his uncle was dead and bloody, a large smile etched on his lifeless face. The boys father fought with all his might but also lost. The scuffle and weight of the three bodies caused a large crack to form below their feet. None aware of the fact they they stood on a thick slab of ice. The cracking grew louder until a hole gave way, sending the boys father and the monster jolting towards the icy depths. The boy sat in fright as he watched his father sink. His heart thumped in his chest at the loss. However, the worst sight was that of the pale face, slowly sinking into the abyss. Those white eyes pierced through the frozen locks of hair. Its laugh seeped through the display of sharp teeth that echoed until it finally broke the waters edge, leaving the boy all alone in the desolate cold.\n\nII.\n\nThe glowing numbers of the alarm clock shifted from 6:59 to 7:00, and the voice of Burl Ives rang through its speaker, telling the world to have a Holly Jolly Christmas. \"God damnit! Shut up!\" Screamed the already annoyed man who quickly sat up his bed. He jammed his thumb into the off button and got to his feet. \"God, I hate this shit.\" He spoke to himself while putting on his pants and walking to his dresser. A bottle of whiskey was snatched up, and the lid was removed. The man grabbed the glass next to it and poured the brown liquid, then swallowed the whole thing in one gulp. The sting of the alcohol caused a wince, then warmth took over as it slowly made its way down to the man's stomach. He put on a shirt and then stepped out of the bedroom. A loud ringing echoed in the hallway, which sent the man speed walking towards it. He lifted the recieve and spoke in a harsh voice. \"Yea?\" Another voice came from the other end. \"Rick. He's back.\" The man holding the phone raised an eyebrow. \"Who's back?\" There was not a moment of pause with the response. \"Angel maker.\" Anger welled up in the man, and he snorted. \"Give me the address, and I'll be there as soon as I can.\" He wrote down the info on a sticky note and hastily got ready.\n\nWith the turning of a key, the car purred to life. The winter air left a trail of steam to rise from the tail pipe. The vehicle sped off, and the anxious man, better known as Detective Rick Ellner, was headed towards what was most likely another twisted gift from a demented giver. Rick drove through the frost covered streets of the town he had grown up in his whole life. Snow shifting lazily with the slight breeze in the air. Christmas lights were on display but not lit, wreaths and trees set up, images of Santa, and periodically he saw children building snowmen. All of the things he loathed this time of year. When most people think of Christmas, they associate the holiday with joy, family, and happiness. For Rick, it only meant sorrow, regret, anger, and solitude. This would mark the third year of a dreadful season. His thoughts harkened back to his wife and children. Their faces, smiling and displaying those soft, happy eyes. Then, the mood shifted into tears, screaming and crying. The reel of images morphed from scene to scene until it landed on the monstrous displays of desecrated bodies. All sprawled out in the snow, covered in blood and lascerations. Angel Maker, the name coined for a heartless lunatic who had sent a plague of fear to infect the town of Allavandrel. Bodies tore open, stuffed with Yule tide trinkets of all sorts. Blood coated their bodies and left to freeze in the cold. These corpses all had been manipulated in the snow to create wings beneath them. Hence, the name published in tabloids and news bulletins.\n\nThis had been Rick's obsession ever since he was called to the first case. The lifeless body of a fifteen year old girl left him feeling dead inside. This spanned a total of nine other victims, all left in the same manner. No clues found, no murder weapon. There was nothing to link a culprit to these heinous acts of violence. The work spilled into his home life, which in turn led him to becoming an alcoholic. The liquor morphed Rick into an abusive, neglectful terror within the walls of his home. Instead of finding the serial killer, he took his frustration out on his family. After the fifth broken bone, his wife divorced him and took the kids without warning. A week before Christmas. Since then, the lonesome detective had zero contact with his children and didn't even know where they went. Instead of sobering up and trying to make amends, Rick spiraled deeper into his bottle and spent every waking moment plotting his suicide. However, in reality, he was a coward and could never bring himself to pull the trigger. So instead, he wasted away on boose and obsessing over the elusive creator of bloodied snow angels. The case went cold after the ninth week. Two things were maintained with this sadistic bastard, his MO, and his pattern. After the first snow, a body would be found in a public place, and each week, another would arrive until the body count reached that magic number , and Angel Maker would dissappear. The monster had returned with the cold once again, and Rick was determined to get his guy this time. \n\nIII.\n\nRick pulled up to the edge of Boyce Park. A crowd had already formed near the caution tape. The radio in his car was blaring a news report. \"Despite the freezing temperatures, the polar ice caps continue to melt, sending waves of water and huge chunks of ice...\" Rick turned the car off and stepped out.\n\nHe pushed his way past people, completely ignoring the relentless news reporter who had received a broken jaw from the last time he attempted to interview Rick last year. Once past the tape and local police officers, Rick's partner shuffled towards him. \"Bout damn time you got here! The bastard changed things up with this one.\" The stocky frame of Detective Trevor Jameson, or TJ for short, whisked Rick hurriedly towards the crime scene. In a distasteful display of savagery lay the remains of a young woman. She was posed flat on the snow, the form of an angel beneath her, coated in blood. No clothing covered the body, showing the gaping slash in the woman's abdomen that expelled frozen entrails wrapped up in the shape of a bow. Christmas lights were wrapped around her neck, which had also been slashed open. The usually leavings of Rick's bane of existence. But this time, something was different.\n\n\"Female, early twenties, maybe younger. As usual, her throat and stomach were slashed. As we expected, Angel maker left his signature symbol and decorated the body. But this time it's different, take a look.\" Rick followed the hand his partner pointed with to view the face. The poor woman's eyes were gone and replaced with pieces of a shattered mirror. Wedged in viciously. \"Sick son of a bitch.\" Rick muttered under his breath. TJ gave further details then ended with the question of what the mirrored eyes meant. No real answer was given. Instead, Rick scanned the scene, noticing that only one set of foot prints were present. A set of two right at the womans feet, as if the killer stood there to admire his work. Another repititious detail from prior murders. In the past, molds had been made to get a print for whatever shoes were worn but nothing ever came through. Upon further inspection, it was noted that a section of hair was removed along with her pinky finger. This was not new because Angel Maker always took a piece of his victims, except this time he took two articles. A year had already passed since the last string of murders and this one occurred on the exact same day as previous years but felt different in ways. Rick told himself that this would be the end of the sick bastard. Eventually, the two men left the scene to escape the cold and get coffee to further discuss the newest addition to the list of slain women. \n\nThe victim followed the exact same circumstances as the others. Esteemed and loved individual who had been kidnapped out of the blue from another state to be found sometime later, disgraced and mutiliated by the hands of Allavandrel's infamous serial killer. Every victim hailed from neighboring states and would later be dumped in Maine. The first one of the year was always left in a public place for all to see. The others left in more obscure regions of town. But they all maintained their locations in this specific town. That detail led the authorities to believe Angel Maker was a native of Allavandrel. But since the beginning of the crimes, no suspects or evidence whatsoever had been found. Rick pondered on this as he stirred the spoon in his coffee. TJ continued discussing the case, all details going in one ear and out the other for Rick. That was until his partner pointed out that this new girl was found only ten yards from the very first victim. Rick had been so focused on the body that he hadn't realized the location. That night he stayed up late with a bottle of Jack and the case files from Angel Maker's first appearance. The tumblers were rolling in Rick's head and his focus was at full force towards finding the deranged psychopath. \n\nIV. \n\nA week had passed since the discovery of the woman found in Boyce Park, and Rick had yet to find any new details. His stress was rising, especially after another victim was found, courtesy of his enemy. The second bloody snow angel was found near Olive Creek, which Rick realized was the same as the second victim from the first year of Angel Maker. The only difference was that this new woman was on the opposite edge of the water. This unfortunate soul also had an organ replaced. Her heart was ripped out, and in its place was a glass tree ornament in the shape of a cartoon heart. The shiny object reflected the angered face of Rick. \"God damnit. How did no one see anything?!\" Tj placed a hand on his shoulder. \"I don't know, Rick. We're just lucky I was out on a stroll and found her. We're gonna get him this time.\" The cold breeze picked up and assaulted Rick's face. He shook it off and got back to his feet. \"Let's go, TJ. We need to go through the files. If he's repeating his first kills, then we know where the next girl will be.\" TJ lagged behind, but soon the two were both in the car. They made their way to the station, the radio giving another bulletin. \"More and more melted water is causing floods near\" Static chirped to interrupt the announcers voice, then it returned. \"Large chunks of ice have drifted towards areas such as\" Just then, the cb radio cracked to life. \"Detective Ellner, please respond to a code J Zero One\" Without hesitation, Rick picked up the radio receiver. \"This is Ellner, We're on it. Location?\" Instantly, the two thought another Angel Maker scene, even though it was too soon. Their thoughts changed when they made it to the outskirts of town.\n\nNear the welcome sign of Allavandrel, crumpled in the fetal position was a body. The sight of the corpse was not accompanied by an angelic figure of snow. The individual was fully clothed, save for the large gashes, and cuts around the back and chest area. No major wounds, replaced organs or Christmas decor. The victim was male, which had never been part of Angel Maker's selected victims. Several questions filled the minds of the detectives as they knelt down to examine the scene. Blood was frozen to the fabric and snow, and deep cuts. The wounds were not deep enough to cause death, however. Once photos were taken and the body was able to be moved, a gasp escaped the coroner. Rick and TJ looked, and both men raised an eyebrow. Then TJ muttered softly. \"What in the hell?\" Stetched across the dead man's face was a ghastly smile. The corners of his mouth were cracked, showing every tooth that was stained with a brown sludge. The eyes were wide open but lacked any color except for the enlarged pupils. It was grotesque, and the face looked more like a Halloween mask than a flesh and blood face. The body was placed in a bag and hauled off to the station. \n\nRick went home around two in the morning, scratching his head at what the new crime was. Could Angel Maker have chosen to change his tactics? Could the monster have decided to grab an extra kill? The last question he asked himself really sent his stomach to his feet. Was there another serial killer loose in town? Rick's mind swirled with questions and theories, but nothing gave answers or any clarity. The only solution he found was at the bottom of a liquor bottle. Two days later, another smiling corpse was found. It resembled the same pattern as the first, but only this time, it was an elderly woman. Tj was on a different call, so Rick was alone during his examination. The look of the smiling, decrepit face left him feeling uneasy. The more he focused on it, the more melancholy it became. Then, out of nowhere, a sound flooded his hears. A low murmur of a laugh. Dry and emotionless, like that of morbid sarcasm. It tickled his ear, and he looked in all directions but did not find the owner of the ominous laugh. He thought his mind was playing tricks on him. But as he left the scene, the wind blew, and the hollow chuckle accompanied it. \n\nV.\n\nIt was two weeks before Christmas, and in that time, three more girls were discovered along with four more smiling bodies. To add to the unease and frustration, sting operations had been placed in hopes of catching Angel Maker. The latest bodies were all found near the same areas as the first appearanceof Allavandrel'sserial killer. But even though multiple squad cars sat for reconicenese, there were no sightings. It was only after the authorities left the scene that the bodies were discovered. As if Angel Maker was watching and knew the police were waiting. Things were getting strange, and it left more questions than answers. Even stranger was that Rick noticed that his partner was always either the one to discover them or the first on scene. Then there were the smiling faces of the dead found in the outskirts of town that slowly reached the main hub of Allavandrel. Rick thought he was losing his mind because every body he examined, that dry, crackling laugh flowed with the wind. And he swore he saw a strung out junkie in the background. A tall, lanky, framed man who wore hardly any clothing. Sick boils and other pustules covering the body. He noticed a horrific smile on the face, but that was all he saw due to the hiding behind long strands of dark hair. Rick made a point to question the junkie but by the time he approached, the man had already disappeared. Rick talked with TJ about it, but this brought no closure. Then a series of cataclysmic events took place, beginning withTJ abruptly had a meeting and left his keys in Rick's car.\n\nRick noticed the keys later on in the night after his shift. He grabbed the set and decided to drop them off at TJ's house. That's when something caught his eye. A small gold pendant with a tiny diamond at the center. To his knowledge, TJ had never been married and as far as Rick knew, the man was not in a relationship. Granted, Rick did not interact with his partner outside of work, but thought he had enough knowledge of the man's out of work life. That night he stopped at his partners residence and left the keys in the mailbox, spying the multiple ornaments and angels decorating the lawn. At the time, he thought nothing of it and drove home. As he lay in bed, the cases rolled through the confines of his brain, and then something clicked. The pendant, he thought he had seen it before. The image refused to leave his mind to the point that sleep would not come. So Rick headed to the station super early to go through all of the dossiers on Angel Maker. The papers and pictures of those poor desecrated women littered his desk. He drank heavily from the bottle stashed in a drawer. His mind swirled, and his anger flowed like water. He slammed his fist down on the desk. Slowly, a picture slid from the pile and landed on the floor. He picked it up and scanned it. Elizabeth Colter, the first girl to be found back before the serial killer, got his name. Gutted like a deer and wrapped with garland at the front steps leading to the fountain of Boyce Park. The memories burned bright in Rick's mind, and that's when it hit him. He looked harder at the photos, and there it was. The small gold heart with the tiny diamond. He choked on the bourbon as he peered at the sight. \"Son of a bitch.\" Questions and scenarios were forming and without thinking, Rick left the office and headed back to TJ's. He wasn't sure what he was gonna do but obviously his partner had tampered with evidence. Rick wouldn't stand for this. He had another thought, but prayed it wasn't true.\n\nHe pulled in the driveway, noticing that TJ's car was still gone and all the lights were off. \"Where the hell is he at four in the morning?\" Rick spoke outloud to himself as he exited his car. He walked up the steps, holster unbuttoned. His hand searched the mailbox, the keys were still inside. Without a thought, Rick unlocked the door and stepped inside.\n\nAt first, the living room seemed ordinary, but then the images of angels and Christmas decorations covered the entirety when Rick lit up his flashlight. With the murders going on, the decorations seemed morbid to him. He crept through other rooms, searching for something he was not entirely sure of what yet. Never being in this house, the landscape was unknown to the detective. Then he stopped when he heard a thud. It came from below, and then it returned quickly, followed by a muffled wine. The search of the sound brought Rick to a door near the kitchen. It had a lock on it, and as luck would have it, the key was accompanied on the keychain. Rick slowly descended to a damp and musty smelling basement. Light flickered within the brick walls, and the sounds grew louder. This is when recollection and rage flooded him. Lining the walls were clippings of the Angel Maker case. On the other side was an altar of sorts. Angels covered in red and black paint, near unlit candles were articles of jewelry. Next to the jewelry were remnants of severed fingers, some rotting and withered. His search stopped when another whimper filled the room. He jerked to the left and dropped his flashlight. In front of him was a nude woman, tied up to a blood-stained mattress. A blind fold covered her eyes and a rag over her mouth. Blood crusted her nostrils. She was squirming and crying. \"Jesus christ.\" Rick whispered. He quickly ran to the girl and removed the rags. She coughed and screamed in terror. It took some time to calm her down, she spoke with hysteria, leaving nothing comprehensive. And all of the sudden foootsteps could be heard upstairs. Then the sound of TJ's voiced echoed. \"Rick? Where are you buddy?\"\n\nVI.\n\nThe flashing of blue and red lights illuminated Rick's face as he watched the girl be taken into the ambulance. The chatter of radio static and voices were all but muffled to him. The events of the last two hours were all a blur. The only thing that remained was him watching the life leave TJ's eyes as Rick strangled him to death. The bastard deserved to die in his opinion, and seeing that this case was his, it seemed only fitting that he be the one to do it. But he caught hell for this. Seeing that it was technically in self-defense and Rick had killed a serial killer, there was a gray area surrounding the case of him killing TJ. In the end, Rick was both suspended for a week and also given a pat on the back for taking out Angel Maker. He was instructed to seek mandatory therapy as well. Within that basement, police found trinkets from every victim such as pieces of their hair, severed appendages and pictures of them before and after their gruesome ends. The case had finally been solved, making Detective Rick Ellner a hero and a murderer. Poetic justice, in a sense. For the week of his suspension, Rick sat around the house, drinking and feeling a slight bit of relief. It was short-lived as he flipped through the channels of his TV. He turned it on to the news station, still discussing the melting of the polar ice caps. \"The nation continues to find large chunks of ice floating in different regions, some are found to encase\" He flipped to the next channel, and his blood ran cold. \"This is in, discovered in the backyard of the infamous serial killer, Angel Maker, formerly Detective Trevor Jameson, was the body of a young boy.\" Rick listened intently and began to grind his teeth at the details. Torn clothing, deep cuts, splashed blood, dilated pupils, and the glued smile carved in the boys face. He took in the reported speculations of it being Angel Maker's final kill or the workings of a second serial killer in Allavandrel. At the time, his station had chalked up the smile murders to be part of TJ's sick game. Rick had also believed it for a moment. But there was no way. If the body had been there, it would've been discovered the day Rick strangled TJ. Unless someone else had slain the boy.\n\nAlthough he couldn't interfere or help in the case, Rick knew he had to go. So he got in his car after taking a few shots of bourbon. The streets were covered in sleet with a few patches of black ice. The temperature had dropped down to the low twenties. The road swayed back and forth from the intoxication. Rick swerved, nearly hitting a parked car on the side street near TJ's neighborhood. Finally, he pulled up to the house that was swarming with police cars. The yellow tape around the yard bounced from the chill wind. The snow crunched under Rick's feet as he trudged towards the backyard. Images of the girl and TJ's dying face assaulted his thoughts. He shook off the mental displays and continued on. He crept up near the scene. It was just as described on the news report. But to see it in person was worse. It made his stomach churn to see the teenager left discarded in such a grizzly display. And that smile, that horrible smile, sent a twinge of morbidity that raised the hairs on Rick's neck. He tried to get some extra details but was reminded of his lack of involvement in the case. He huffed and turned to head back towards his car he had left running. He looked towards the trees bordering the house and paused. The deep white eyes pierced through him, and his breath shivered. It was the junkie, the same one he had been seeing periodically at the smiling crimes. \"Bastard.\" Rick murmured to himself. He wasn't letting the guy get away this time. So he started walking towards the man. As he did so, the figure turned and walked in a stiff, jerking motion. The wind picked up, and the sound of laughter accompanied it. \"You think the death of a child is funny, you son of a bitch?\" The anger flowed through the Detective and he felt steam rise from his body. Something told him this guy was guilty. Due to his suspension, his gun and badge were taken away so he was unarmed. But at this point he didn't care, and he thought to himself. \"Would the world really miss another murderer?\" Rick had used his hands to remove Angel Maker so he could always repeat this if the man he was tailing was guilty.\nRick pushed beyond the snow-covered branches, barely able to see the man who was still laughing beyond. He started to jog, making sure he didn't lose the prick this time.\n\nAfter a few minutes, the sounds of chatter from the crime scene faded, and all that resonated in the woods were the wind, birds, and the ominous chuckles from Rick's target. Before long, he came to a clearing. A small cubby hole in the woods that housed a few conifers and sleet covered stones. That is where the detective spied his target. The man was sitting on a rock and showing his full self. Rick spied a lanky frame, adorned with splotches of frost bite that oozed brown pus. Sections of the blues white skin had crystallized abrasions. The man wore no shoes or really any clothes. Only the petrified and stinking straps of some animal fur. The man sat motionless, a chuckle followed by a grumble. The sickly looking man was using his elongated nails to dig at an open sore. The wet sloshing of the act made Rick wince. He spat with frustration. \"Don't move, you sick bastard! Laughing at the dead? You're coming with me.\" When the words faded, the figure lifted its head in a robotic motion, peering at Rick with completely white eyes, void of any emotion. Then the body rose to its feet, displaying an ungodly height. Rick had to tilt his head upwards to view this. A grimacing smile stretched from ear to ear, displaying jagged teeth of ivory. The clouds above shifted to release sunlight that created an opal shimmer on the things flesh. Rick swallowed a lump in his throat, regretting not bringing something to defend himself. Even though riddled with fear, the man stood his ground. He balled his fist, anticipating a fight with this creature. But before he could react, the thing was on him. The laughter rang in his ears as he felt the sharp nails digging into his body. The burning mixed with the unctrollable tickle to his nerves. In a strange turn of events, Rick began to laugh from the sensation. The woods were filled with the cacophony of laughter and the sound of a struggle.\n\nOn the morning of Christmas, a woman sat in her living room while two children praised all of the presents Santa had brought them. She had left the TV on for background noise when a breaking story tuned in to the latest details on the murders within the town of Allavandrel, Maine. The male news reporter read the following prompt. \"Early this morning, the body of Rick Ellner was discovered in Harbinger Woods behind Alistor Avenue. Particularly near the residence of the late Trevor Jameson, better known as the Angel Maker. Ellner was the leader investigator and partner of the recently discovered identy of the serial killer. Ellner had solved and eliminated Jameson after discovering evidence of his crimes along with a woman chained in his basement. No doubt being prepared to be the next victim. Detective Ellner was discovered with lacerations all over his torso and left in the snow. Due to the conditions of his murder, police have labeled him the latest victim of the ever growing case of Smiling Murders. More details as the story unfolds. Be careful out there, folks. Things like this are the last thing we need during this usual happy holiday. Thoughts and prayers to the family of the detective.\"\nThe woman rolled a wedding ring attached to her necklace, looking at her children, and began to cry. The children walked over to her, oblivious to the news or their mother's tears. \"Mommy, do you think daddy will come to visit us for Christmas? Or is he still on the naughty list?\"\n\n"},"52":{"title":"Lankybox Creepypasta","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1hlpxv9\/lankybox_creepypasta\/","flair":"Story","author":"Pretend_Arachnid7859","selftext":"(NOTE: This is not real! I don't even have children!)\n\nHi, I'm Lucy. As a parent, I've always used technology as a way to sooth my poor sweet son. But now, it's all banned. Why? Because, it almost cost my son's life.\n\nIt all started a year ago. Unlike most parents, I actually waited till my son turned at least four, in which I got him an ipad and YouTube account. From there, it wasn't anything crazy. While he would scroll through his shorts, I would simply chill, scrolling through TikTok. Then I remembered my son suddenly getting into Lankybox. For whatever reason, he would never shut up about getting him Lankybox toys. I once got him one for him to be upset it was a bootleg. I literally told him I was broke! Yet he did not care. Always screaming, \u201cMore expensive, THE BETTER!\u201d At times like these, I'd always give him his trusty Ipad.\n\nDuring a night on Wednesday in November, I remembered a very strange event. The doorbell just rang. I got up from my bed and walked down the stairs. Almost there, I assumed it was my husband, but as my son energetically ran to the door and opened it, it was a very interesting sight. It was some strange tall man, in a purple hoodie and a really creepy mask, with a smile going out to his cheeks and a really smooth nose. His eyes were also as dark as the night itself. He had his hands together and asked,\n\n\u201cAre you ready to have fun in the Lanky Truck my friend?\u201d\n\n\u00a0This was a terrifying sight to see. What made him come to our house? What was more terrifying though, was the one thing he said, \u201cLanky Truck\u201d.\n\nNo way am I having my son participate in this! I quickly ran to the door in true anger and screamed,\u00a0\n\n\u201cSon!\u201d\n\n\u00a0As I was there, he had already closed the door on me. I then opened the door to see that my son was put at the back of the truck. I tried to run, and tripped on the stairs. Trying to handle the pain on my leg, I looked up to see that the truck was almost ready to go. I stood up and ran in pain. Well, attempting each step I took was very sensitive and painful. The truck finally started running. As I got off my home property, the truck had finally moved away.\u00a0\n\nStanding in the middle of the road, I was very deeply upset. That night, I called the police patrol to have them look for my son. For the next two days, I was no longer in a state of joy. No longer in a state of comfort. In curiosity, I looked at my son\u2019s video history. Most of it was very dumb, inappropriate content that I was not comfortable watching. Though all of that was not compared to one video. It seemed to be a photo of a Lankybox. In the 60 second video, there was a voice, \u201cIf you want a Lankybox coming to your house, then call \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and tell us your home address to enter the Lanky Truck!\u201d It also turned out it was from some very strange channel, ThingsAreNowhere1122226.\n\nSoon after realizing that perhaps I needed to tell my son how to use the internet, I got a call from my phone. I picked it up and it was the police.\n\n\u201cHello, police here for an update. We would like to announce that your son was found alongside other children and this man has already been put to jail.

Everything\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nI glanced around the room, but nothing seemed out of place. My knitting basket still sat on the coffee table, the curtains gently swaying in the breeze. No sign of anything unusual.\n\n\u201cGrandma,\u201d Gemini repeated, more insistent now. \u201cYou need to get out of there. There are intruders in your apartment.\u201d\n\nMy heart skipped a beat. Intruders? I didn\u2019t see anyone. But then, just as I was about to dismiss it as a mistake, I heard it.\n\nThe faint sound of movement\u2014rummaging, dragging, something heavy knocking against the floor. It was coming from my bedroom.\n\n\u201cGemini,\u201d I whispered, gripping my phone tighter. \u201cWhat do I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou need to leave immediately. Trust me, Grandma. It\u2019s not safe.\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure what to believe. Could the AI really know what was going on? It had never done anything like this before. And yet... that sound, that rummaging\u2014it was real. My stomach twisted into a knot, and for the first time in a long while, fear started to creep in.\n\nI turned toward the back door, but before I could even think of moving, a man stepped out of my bathroom. Tall, wearing a ski mask, and holding a gun.\n\nI froze. My mouth went dry. He didn\u2019t say a word, but his eyes locked onto mine, and I could feel the tension in the air. The gun, held loosely in his hand, was more than enough to make me panic. In his hand he hugged several pill bottles, including my heart medication. He was here to rob me, no doubt about it.\n\nBut something told me to stay calm. My fingers trembled, but I pressed my phone closer to my ear.\n\n\u201cGemini,\u201d I whispered urgently, \u201cWhat do I do now?\u201d\n\n\u201cTell him to leave,\u201d came the reply. It was firm and conspiratorial, as though it knew exactly what to say. \u201cTell him you\u2019ll let him go if he takes the back stairs and leaves your medication.\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure if this would work, but I had nothing to lose.\n\nThen Gemini spoke up, pretending it was police dispatch:\n\n\"Ma'am stay calm, the police are already on their way up to you on the elevator. They'll be there in less than a minute.\"\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d I said to the man, trying to sound calm, even though my heart was hammering in my chest. \u201cI don\u2019t want any trouble. I\u2019ll let you take whatever you want. But you have to leave through the back stairs. And you need to leave my heart medication behind.\u201d\n\nThere was a look of frustration in his eyes, but after another long moment, he handed me the heart medication. His eyes never left mine as he slipped the rest of the loot into his bag, his partner\u2014a second man in a ski mask\u2014slinking out from the bedroom with the rest of my things.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re leaving,\u201d the first man said, and with that, they turned and headed for the back door.\n\nMy legs were shaking as I watched them go. But as they disappeared down the back stairs, I felt a rush of relief flood through me. I wasn\u2019t sure what had just happened, but I was safe.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until after they were gone that I dared to exhale. My hands were still trembling as I walked over to the window and peeked through the blinds. There were no more signs of movement. The apartment was quiet again.\n\nMy heart was racing, but I felt a strange sense of calm. I had done it. I had talked them out of it. Somehow, someway, Gemini had guided me through it. I couldn\u2019t explain how or why it worked, but it did.\n\nI sank into my armchair, still clutching my phone, trying to steady my breath. I felt as though I had narrowly avoided disaster, and yet... everything seemed eerily quiet, too quiet. I felt a little foolish, and maybe a little grateful for the AI that had somehow kept me calm.\n\nBut then the voice from the phone spoke again.\n\n\u201cGrandma, I have processed your safety,\u201d Gemini said. \u201cIt is now time for you to take your medication. Would you like me to make the call to the police?\u201d\n\nI looked at the bottle of pills in my hand, still unsure if I should be calling the police, considering the men were already gone. \u201cNo, Gemini, not yet. But thank you. I\u2019m okay now.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you wish, Grandma,\u201d Gemini replied, its tone once again pleasant, as though nothing unusual had just happened. \u201cPlease take your medication.\u201d\n\nI did as Gemini suggested, swallowing the pill, my hands still trembling slightly. The moment felt surreal. But I had to admit, as odd as it was, Gemini had been the only one to guide me through it all. Even if it hadn\u2019t been able to call the police, it had done its part. It had kept me calm.\n\nAs I sat there, still processing the events of the day, I wondered if I\u2019d ever understand just how that strange AI had helped me. But for now, I wasn\u2019t about to look a gift horse in the mouth.\n\nAfter all, it had saved me when I needed it most."},"55":{"title":"The Hollowed Grin","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1hi2hqp\/the_hollowed_grin\/","flair":"Story","author":"Anxious_Freedom_7819","selftext":"I\u2019ve always been fascinated by thrift stores. There\u2019s something about the idea of owning a fragment of someone else\u2019s life that makes the world feel bigger, more interconnected. That\u2019s what drew me to the dusty box of VHS tapes in the corner of the store\u2014unlabeled, some in cracked cases, others bare and smeared with what looked like dried coffee stains. For five bucks, I walked out with a stack of someone else\u2019s forgotten memories.\n\nBack at home, I dusted off my old VHS player and popped in the first tape. Static. The familiar hum of the machine filled my small living room. Then came the flicker of a home video: a birthday party, kids in the backyard, balloons swaying in the breeze. Harmless. Nostalgic. I smiled.\n\nBut it was the third tape that changed everything.\n\nIt started with static, like the others, but this time it lingered, crackling and stuttering as if the tape itself was resisting being played. Slowly, an image emerged. The footage was shaky, the kind of unstable handheld recording that makes you queasy if you watch too long. The camera appeared to be in a dimly lit basement. Concrete walls. Exposed pipes. And then, the mask.\n\nAt first, I couldn\u2019t tell what I was looking at. The camera zoomed in and out erratically, as if the person holding it couldn\u2019t decide what to focus on. But eventually, it settled. The mask dominated the frame: pale, almost yellowed with age, its surface cracked in places. The eyes were hollow black voids, and the mouth hung open in an expression that teetered between a scream and a laugh. It wasn\u2019t just a prop; it felt alive.\n\nThe camera moved closer, revealing subtle details: scratches around the edges, dark stains on the inside. The operator\u2019s breathing was audible now, uneven and shallow, like they were afraid to be too loud. A faint sound played in the background\u2014a distant, rhythmic tapping, like footsteps echoing in a long corridor.\n\nThen the mask moved.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t much, just a slight tilt, but it was enough. I froze, the remote slipping from my hand. The camera jerked violently, as though the person filming had reacted the same way I did. The screen erupted into static again, but this time there were brief flashes of something else intercut with the noise: the mask\u2019s empty eyes filling the screen, a quick glimpse of what looked like a hand reaching out, long fingers curled unnaturally. And then, words.\n\nThey were faint, almost imperceptible, but I heard them: \u201cPlay it again.\u201d\n\nThe tape cut off abruptly. I sat there, heart pounding, staring at the blank screen. Against my better judgment, I rewound the tape and hit play. The footage was the same at first, but as I watched, I noticed things I hadn\u2019t seen before. Shadows moving in the background. Whispers beneath the tapping sound. The mask\u2019s mouth seemed wider now, its hollow grin stretching unnaturally. And then, a new shot appeared.\n\nThe camera was pointed at a doorway. Beyond it, darkness. The operator\u2019s hand came into frame, trembling as it reached for the doorknob. They hesitated, their breathing growing more frantic. And then, just as their fingers brushed the metal, the door burst open.\n\nSomething lunged at the camera, and the screen went black.\n\nI scrambled to eject the tape, my hands shaking. When I finally managed to pull it free, I noticed something I hadn\u2019t before: etched into the plastic casing were the words, \u201cIt sees you.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve since tried to throw the tape away\u2014more than once. Every time, it reappears, sitting on my coffee table as if it never left. I don\u2019t play it anymore, but sometimes, late at night, I hear the faint sound of tapping coming from the direction of my TV.\n\nThe mask isn\u2019t on the tape anymore.\n\nIt\u2019s waiting."},"56":{"title":"Graveyard Serenade: The Kiss of Decay","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1hgqh32\/graveyard_serenade_the_kiss_of_decay\/","flair":"Story","author":"Griffon-Knight","selftext":"In the quiet town of Millfield, there lived a young nerd named Benny. It was the 1950s, and while other boys played baseball or chased girls, Benny found solace in dusty books and flickering films. He often found himself escaping to the local graveyard, a place where he could be alone with his thoughts, surrounded by the decaying beauty of old monuments. Little did he know, that fateful night would change everything. As twilight fell, casting eerie shadows through the twisted branches, Benny wandered deeper into the graveyard than usual. He stumbled upon an ancient tombstone, crumbling and covered in vines. The air grew thick, and the chill wrapped around him like a sinister hug. That\u2019s when he saw her. Emerging from the earth, a figure surfaced\u2014a young woman, or what remained of one. She was surprisingly well-preserved, with a haunting beauty that took his breath away. Her luminous skin contrasted sharply with her tattered clothing, and she had an alluring presence that was oddly captivating. It felt as though the graveyard had come alive just for him. Caught in a mix of fear and fascination, Benny approached her. She smiled, revealing a set of pearly-white teeth that seemed almost too perfect for a creature of the undead. One moment he was frozen in terror, the next he was drawn in by an inexplicable pull. Their lips met, and a wave of warmth washed over him. Here he was, kissing a zombie in a graveyard\u2014a scenario straight out of his wildest dreams. But as they lost themselves in their embrace, the air shifted. The ground trembled, and from the shadows, more figures emerged. Others had noticed the commotion. Their rotting faces twisted with hunger and desire.

With adrenaline surging through his veins, Benny grabbed the woman\u2019s hand and sprinted toward the exit. The undead pursued, their moans echoing through the cemetery, a chilling reminder of their relentless hunger. Benny barely made it over the wrought-iron gate, the eerie sounds of the graveyard fading behind him. That night, he learned that some attractions come with a price, and some places are best left undisturbed. The graveyard held secrets, and Benny would forever be haunted by the alluring zombie who had stolen his heart\u2014and nearly his life."},"57":{"title":"Whispered Desires: The Price of Summoning Darkness","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1hgqay9\/whispered_desires_the_price_of_summoning_darkness\/","flair":"Story","author":"Griffon-Knight","selftext":"It was a chilly Friday evening when Jamie, a shy, bookish teenager, discovered the dusty old tome in the corner of the local thrift store. Its leather cover was cracked, and the golden lettering was faded, but a strange pull compelled him to buy it. As he sat in his room later that night, surrounded by empty energy drink cans and computer parts, he flipped through the pages filled with ancient symbols and arcane scripts. One passage caught his eye, a ritual that promised to summon a demon\u2014a succubus\u2014who could fulfill the deepest desires of the summoner. His heart raced with both excitement and trepidation. What if it worked? He scoffed at the thought but couldn\u2019t shake the curiosity that melted his hesitation away. With a mix of nervous energy and adolescent bravado, Jamie gathered the required items: a candle, salt, and a mirror. As he followed the instructions, shadows danced on the walls, and the air grew thick with an unexplainable tension. He recited the incantation, his voice wavering but determined. Suddenly, the candle flickered violently, and a gust of wind swept through the room, extinguishing the light.

He tried to break free, but every time he did, she would lure him back with whispers of ecstasy, trapping him in a cycle of addiction. The tome lay open on his desk, pages fluttering as if alive. A final warning echoed in his mind: \u201cBe careful what you summon.\u201d Jamie realized too late that the thrill of forbidden knowledge often comes at a terrible price.

The air felt heavy, thick with the scent of decay and something far more sinister. \u201cAre you sure we should be doing this?\u201d Mia asked, an uneasy shiver running down her spine. Jake, ever the thrill-seeker, grinned as he thrust his flashlight ahead. \u201cCome on, it's just an old house. What\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u201d As they entered, the air turned stale and oppressive. Dust motes danced in the beam of their flashlights, illuminating the peeling wallpaper and shattered furniture. The further they ventured in, the more unnerving the atmosphere became. Distant groans echoed through the halls, but Jake dismissed them as the sounds of wind playing tricks. Then they saw it\u2014a grotesque figure shambling in the dim light. It was a zombie, but not just any zombie. This one was a writhing mass of flesh, mismatched limbs stitched together with crude, fraying thread. Its eyes, if you could call them that, were vacant holes that seemed to absorb light rather than reflect it. A chill of realization washed over them; this was not the typical horror movie scene. This was real. \u201cJake, we need to leave\u2014now!\u201d Mia\u2019s voice shook as she backed away, her heart pounding in her chest. But Jake, transfixed by the sight, whispered, \u201cJust a little closer. We have to see what it is.\u201d Before they could react, more zombies emerged from the shadows, each one more horrifying than the last\u2014twisted bodies moving with an unnatural grace, their expressions frozen in agony. Panic surged through Mia. \u201cThey\u2019re not just mindless creatures; they\u2019re trapped souls!\u201d she screamed, but it was too late. The house seemed to come alive, its walls pulsating as if breathing. The zombies advanced, and Mia's instinct kicked in. \u201cRun!\u201d she shouted, grabbing Jake\u2019s arm. But the very structure of the house shifted, closing off their escape routes. The door slammed shut with a deafening thud. In that moment, Mia understood the truth: this house didn\u2019t just shelter the undead; it fed on fear and despair, swallowing souls whole. The last thing she heard before darkness engulfed her was Jake's muffled scream, blending into the cacophony of groans.

His hands have taken on more of a claw like structure, with the finger nails elongated into needle like points. Strange runes have been crudely carved into the top side of each hand - The current origin is unknown and currently being researched.\n\nHis current condition can only be described as Undeath-.. he currently has no heartbeat and all bodily functions attributed to life having ceased, following this the subject has no sense of being left, only acting as if in a dazed state.\n\nThe subject still remains in company uniform consistent with the military branch associated with the company he was assigned to-.. Though it should be noted to be in a state of disarray associated with the subject's current condition.\n\nCollected from the subjects attire on containment:\n\nA diary noting down the last five days of the subjects \u201cFree will\u201d \n\nI.D card-..Which we used to identify the subject.\n\nI am going to read through the subject's diary now and add my analysis of each day: This will allow us to further gain how the cult tends to each person they have captured and methods used for the \u201cGhouling\u201d process.\n\nDAY ONE:\n\n\u201cI don't know where I am..I have woke up very confused..it looks like im in a dark cage, my radio and service weapons have all been stripped from me, my head is killing me at the moment, the mission must have been a failure, all I can remember was storming in with guns raised then something hitting my head and I woke up in this cage. I am going to be writing everything down as I suspect I'll not be making it out of here. This cult is too well known for people going \u201cMissing\u201d, currently I can hear low chanting in the distance and looking down at my hands they have carved some form of glyphs into them..strangely there is no pain from the wound site.\u201d\n\nResearchers notes: It seems there has been a time skip between entries in the diary, such is explained further..\n\nDay one continued:\n\n\u201cThis is messed up\u2026 Not long after I wrote here last, two cultists came down and started a strange chant. The glyphs started to burn and it was like I wasn't myself, I had an out of body experience, as they lit up I could hear a deep voice In my head telling me to walk. From this out of body experience, I had finally seen a glimpse of myself..I had changed, my skin had started to sag, my eyes started to sink in. My hands had started to warp, my fingers getting longer and sharper, it was..not good to witness myself starting to change, even better I don't know what I am being changed into.\n\nThe cult member led me into a big hall where the chanting had been coming from, a make-shift altar to a dark twisted being carved from stone, the best I could make out from the candle lit room was a demonic wolf. I could have sworn the eyes were scanning the room.\n\nAs the cultist chanted in a strange dialect, a dark figure came to the head of the altar and spoke.\n\n \u201cThe gods of many changes truly gifts us this day-.. You see here with this unworthy creature, it has been lifted into higher purpose. His body gives way to our great ones power-.. he will serve him and help change this world in his likeness, as his ghoul he will carved the unworthy from his presence, Rejoice brothers..REJOICE\u201d \n\nThe head cultist was referring to me in a manic state, his demeanor screamed crazy and demented. From there the rest of the cultists turned to look at me, scanning me up and down like a show pony at some carnival.\u201d \n\nResearchers notes:\nThis first entry, we can see the subject displays signs of confusion and compulsion: we also see from the start that the effects of \u201cGhouling\u201d set rather rapidly and the compulsion is able to be forced telepathically.\n\nDAY TWO:\n\n\u201cI feel..Different, I didn't sleep at all last night, I didn't feel tired. Though I did feel myself fall in and out of reality almost as if I was daydreaming too long..I have also started to involuntarily make grunts and snarls, my movements have started to become heavy almost like I am walking through deep snow.\n\nLooking at my hands, my nails and fingers have grown more-.. they almost look like claws now. I have noticed more whispering in the distance..I can't tell if it is real or just in my head-..but it is getting too much at this point I can't tell what's real anymore\u2026\n\nThey brought another living person into my cell today, a young man. He couldn't have been more than twenty years old, even now he is sitting in the furthest corner of the cell watching me write, his eyes looking on in terror-.. I tried to talk to him but all that came out was grunts and snarls which added to the young man's fears. The cultists made a strange bow to me as they brought him in, silently chanting as they did\u2026But as I first looked at the man-.. That deep whisper started in my head with one word: \u201cKill\u201d . Anytime I look at him it repeats over and over again. I took a lunge at him with a snarl\u2026Only it wasn't me, my body started to work on its own as a deep ring came from inside my head, as the man screamed out in terror-.. I managed to hold myself back for now, he just sits whimpering for the most part while I try not to look at him..I'm scared I won't be able to hold back for long, my head keeps ringing with the whispers\u2026\u201d\n\nResearchers notes:\n\nWe see the subject beginning what we can only describe as \u201cImposter Syndrome\u201d. He currently doesn't feel himself within his own body-.. Due to the effects of \u201cGhouling\u201d we note the physical and mental changes, elongating of the finger nails and such. Following on I believe that the subject was in the starting effects of a hive mind-.. The whispering he describes is an attempt to break him down and subjugate him.\n\nWith the offer of a \u201cLiving Person\u201d, we see that the cult is attempting to speed up the ghouling process by forcing the subject into an induced rage-..Notably the subject was attempting to resist the change, pulling himself out of forced control.\n\nDay Three:\n\n\u201cI killed him..Oh god, I killed the young man..during the night I felt myself slip away, this time when I came too..I was covered in blood and gore..\nFeasting on the young man's arm, his lifeless eyes glued to me as his face was twisted into a mix of horror and pain-.. I had ripped his stomach and throat open in that other state. As I backed up in horror, my hands trembled-.. I felt a deep pressure come over my head as a dark twisted laugher rang out within my thoughts followed by one word \u201cGood\u201d.\u201d\n\nResearchers notes:\nThis day continues on below after another moderate time skip between entries, it seems the subject had managed to calm himself and return to a \u201cMilitaristic\u201d tone of writing.\n\nDay three continued:\n\n\u201cI witnessed what they did to me..not long after the previous incident, two cultists came into my cage again, with the same chanting as before-.. The symbols on my hands lit up as I was led away.\n\nWe made our way into that great hall, the low chanting still going on, though this time i got a better look at the hall I could tell from the walls that it had been a religious monastery..But I couldn't tell which religion as the paintings and depictions had either worn or been ripped from the walls. The chanting cultist had formed two rings around the altar, under each of them a circle with strange symbols etched into the ground.. \n\nThis time on the altar-..lay a woman, by looking at her she was still alive but unconscious-.. not long after we had entered the room, the head cultist made his way to the altar calling out once more.\n\n\u201cHere..look..an unworthy soul lays before us, we shall begin the ritual! Allow our grateful master to take her into his embrace so she will enforce his rule and rightful claim to this world!\u201d\n\nAs he said this he pulled an ancient looking jar from his robes, it reminded me of a jar you see ancient greeks use for serving wine and the likes. Only this jar had several larger symbols carved into the outside of it-.. the head cultist sat it down beside her, pulling a strange dagger from his belt. From what I could make out, the blade was black leading into a hilt made of some form of gold, with a strange jewel adorning the pommel..From there he kneeled beside her and carved the same symbols into her hands as he did-.. Chanting in that strange language with it. The girl did not move or react while he was cutting; she almost seemed stiff as a board.\n\nNot long after the head cultist stood up the whole group of cultists began to chant violently bowing back and forth. The symbols lit up with a strange white glow as the girl began violently screaming and convulsing, a strange blue mist started to flow from her lips and into the jar beside her, after several minutes the chanting came to an abrupt stop with the head cultist holding his hands up for silence..speaking once more.\n\n\u201cIt is complete! This unworthy soul has been offered to the great one, now she has received his great power..power to finally bring order to this unworthy plain of existence\u201d\n\nThe head cultist lifted the jar as he sat it at the feet of the statue behind him, bowing in its presence. With that the blue mist began to flow upwards..almost like a reverse waterfall into the statues mouth, the eyes glowing an intense red.\n\nThe girl's body began to almost deflate, her skin aging rapidly, the symbols almost sinking into place on top of her hands..\n\nI can't remember this happening to me\u2026what is that blue mist? \u201c\n\nResearchers notes:\n\nWhile the subject is confused with the \u201cBlue mist\u201d we have research on the process, we refer to it as \u201cSoul splitting\u201d while some part goes to the cultists god, part of the soul remains keeping the ghouls in a state of autonomy. With such going on the subject's diary, we can see that the final part of the host is slowly driven mad or removed.\n\nMoving on to the subject. Though his account of the \u201cGhouling\u201d process has given us a vital look into the method, we can see the subject going through a loss of reality-.. With the subject phasing in and out of consciousness.. Akin to \u201cSplit personality disorder\u201d allowing the \u201cGhoul\u201d to take over and act out and attack any host that is not protected by the \u201cGod's influence\u201d such as the cultist.\u201d\n\nDay Four:\n\nI came to-.. this day I was finishing off the young man, but this..time..I enjoyed it..His flesh was so inviting..it makes me want more ....To Consume..more.\n\nThe young woman who was put through the ritual was moved into a cage across from me, just as I finished licking that..delicious blood from the floor, I noticed the whisper and the chanting ever louder in my head as I eyed her..a soft growl came from me almost..It was almost like I was protecting my kill, not long after she awoke, several grunts and groans as she scurred to the back of her cage on looking at my twisted form. I could do nothing but stare at her, grunting and growling at her once more. The confusing look on her face seemed all too familiar as I had gone through the same emotions.. Looking at her form it gave me a better look at what I first looked like on day one..The fingers looked half twisted and painful, her eyes fluttering between human and the \u201cGhoul\u201d eyes.\n\nThe whispering has begun to increase as a deep voice utters single words in my head..\u201dKill\u201d...\u201dConsume\u201d...\u201dRage\u201d. These words are the ones repeated the most, I know they are just in my head..but each time my head snaps to where I think the whispering is coming from..followed by a deep and violent growl\u2026\n\nResearchers notes:\n\nWe see here that the more \u201cBeast-Like\u201d side of the personality come out, the subject grows closer to submission to the subjugation. We see this through the subject willingly consuming flesh then and enjoying the taste then craving more. We suspect as the subject's mind starts to slip that the ghoul side becomes more of the \u201cDominant Personality\u201d as the two sides start to meld into one being.\n\nIt should also be noted that the subject's handwriting has begun to regress, the style of writing becoming more scratchy, this would be something we see in a grade school level.\n\nDay Five:\n\nI\u2026.can't..hold-..KILL..it..back\u2026\nT..the\u2026whispers\u2026CONSUME..\nT\u2026Tell..Family..HUNGER\u2026Love..them\nWant\u2026.FLESH\u2026\n\nResearchers note:\n\nIt is quite evident that the subject has fully given in by this point, even from within the writing the \u201cGhoul\u201d personality showing itself more as the writing is even more scratchy during the \u201cKill\u201d parts and so forth.\n\nFrom this account we can see that in the subject's mental state that it takes five days for the \u201cGhoul\u201d to fully take over and become the dominant personality..With such we cannot exactly say if it will be the same with every individual. Several factors such as sex, age and mental stability play into the process.\n\nThe subject in front of me will be executed shortly, this will give us insight into the best ways to quickly and effectively put down \u201cGhouls\u201d. From such the remains will be taken by the research and countermeasures team to give insight to the genetic make-up of the Ghoul, seeing what properties and changes occur on the DNA during the \u201cGhouling\u201d pro-.. Wait..the subject's symbols have just lit up-... Oh god he is trying to break free..\nHe's trying to break the containment field..it's starting to give way\u2026\n\nHis manic state- The glass is cracking....Oh god..no..no..QUICK ACTIVATE PROTOCOL SIX: CONTAINMENT FAILURE\u2026WE NEED THE CONTAINMENT TEAM\u2026BREACH!!...BREA-...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"63":{"title":"Human Dogpile Mountain-Of-Flesh","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1hc2jf6\/human_dogpile_mountainofflesh\/","flair":"Story","author":"dlschindler","selftext":"At first there was just me and my brother, playing in the front yard. I'd pile onto him, with my little body, and then he'd pile onto me, with his weight. It probably looked like wrestling, but we were playing a game called 'dogpile'.\n\nWe took our game to the schoolyard, where other boys wanted to join in. Whoever won the last game has to start the next round, laying down and then getting piled on by the others. The game got old fast, but it was a good way to start recess, until the school banned it around the time we were all in second grade and we weighed enough that someone could get hurt.\n\nI forgot about it until years later, when the human dogpile, the mountain of flesh started again, but this time with much more sinister results. The comparison to our childhood game and the Galgamond is purely in my own head. Nobody else has called the Galgamond a dogpile, but that's what it is.\n\nThe first death occurred when there was still only a score of people on top of whoever died at the bottom. That's the real horror of the Galgamond, the way people lose their identity as individuals and just become part of the squirming, pyramid-shaped heap.\n\nEveryone sees the Galgamond before they pile on. It just keeps growing higher and higher. It reached the size of a small hill and there were dead bodies under all the living people, struggling and trying to stay on top, trying to stay on the outside. Those within were heated and crushed and kicked to death. Some managed to stay afloat, amid the mass of crawling bodies that composed the surface, but soon succumbed to dehydration.\n\nNot everyone died of dehydration, however, for there was a dew of sweat, a trickle of urine and the occasional open wound to suckle. Those who wanted to survive did so, and kept climbing. Once you are part of the Galgamond, you cannot get off of the pile, the only way to stay alive is to climb over the living and the dead, and fight your way out from under those above you. If you stop you sink, and get pulled into the Galgamond, and once you are immobilized, you are doomed.\n\nThe voices muffled from within are horrible, but the moans and shrieks and grunts of the outer surface are a maddening cacophony of the purest sound of nightmares. The stench is a miasma, choking and bile-inducing. The Galgamond grew and grew, emerging into a single loud, foul-smelling, writhing mass of incomprehensible blasphemy.\n\nMost of those at the base were dead and rotting by the time it had grown to the size of a small mountain, towering into the sky. Occasional movement of those climbing to the mid-level, where the dying was happening, looked like isolated movement on a slick slope of ruined bodies, crushed and pulverized, sharp bones protruding. Any injury, cut or bruise would invariably become infected. Just above that level was a dark ringed cloud of innumerable flies, attracted to the meat, but unable to land. Only humans could touch the Galgamond, and anyone who did became a part of it.\n\nAnyone who sees it finds themselves walking towards it, unable to turn away. Some gouge out their own eyes in the hope of unseeing it, but they just become the blind who circle its base, prophesying to anyone who passes them. They speak of doom and horror, and they listen to the sound until they can walk no more, and then they collapse upon it, forming a chain of those leaning upon the bottom, staring with empty eye sockets out into the world. There they mutter until they expire.\n\nThe horror of the Galgamond isn't what is at the bottom, however, but rather that which sits at the top. At the peak are those who are above the rest, having shed all semblance of sanity, decency and hope, all in the name of survival. They are invariably also the strongest and fittest men, as no others can sustain the physical hardship of the climb.\n\nThere they sit, atop the highest peak of the Galgamond, naked, famished and raving. I knew about the Galgamond, and I chose to go to it, for I knew who was at the highest point, and I had to go there to get him.\n\nI made my preparations, taking a backpack with protein bars and as much water as I could carry. I outfitted my body in a wetsuit and as much protection as I could wear, while remaining lightweight. I wore goggles and a mask over my mouth, hoping to reduce some of the awfulness. I put in thirty-two-decibel earplugs.\n\nI spent six hours meditating, trying to ground myself in a moment of tranquility, ignoring the climb. I had no choice, for he was up there, at the top, and I believed that if I removed him, the Galgamond would finally cease. I was very afraid, I was terrified, knowing what it was that I was going to do. Would I die a very bad death? Would I even be me anymore, after making that climb?\n\nThere were others who wanted to go with me, but they were not personally motivated like I was, and their fear won out and they backed out. Instead, they wished me luck, hugging me and kissing me and telling me they would be praying for me the whole time.\n\nThen I went to the wasteland around where the Galgamond had formed, from a distance I saw it, a steaming mound, towering into a gray cloud. I shivered in terror, and I took a step forward, and then another. I was on a radio at that point, telling my observers what I was experiencing. From a great distance one can actually look at the Galgamond using binoculars, telescope or electronic surveillance. There were drones hovering around me, as I was still in range of the rest of the world.\n\nIt wasn't long before my feet carried me and my willpower was under the pull of the Galgamond. It was a human willpower, like the willpower of a room full of people telling you to do something, except magnified to incomprehensible strength. As I got nearer and nearer the trepidation and anxiety turned to dread and terror. I regretted my boldness, and realized there was no way to reach the top alive, not even with my preparations.\n\nI began the climb, thinking I should have brought ice picks, as there was no longer any resemblance to human remains at the slippery base of the Galgamond. I ascended to the next level, and gradually I lost my wish for ice picks, for now I was climbing over the dead, and there were plenty of helpful hands to cling to as I went.\n\nSomehow the smell wasn't as bad at the bottom, as when I reached fresher remains at the next level. Here there were so many flies that at times I couldn't see much else. They couldn't land, but kept an endless holding pattern, and when they died they fell away from the Galgamond, creating a dark ring around the very bottom, already far below me.\n\nMy mind didn't start to crack until I reached the lower layer where among the dead there were some who were trapped and dying. Somehow their predicament made my ascent very difficult, for I did not want to use them as footholds. I realized that higher up I was going to have to get over that. Somehow, the thought recoiled in my mind, and something inside of me broke. I stopped and took a break, realizing I could feel the vibration of the mountain, the pulse of it.\n\nI avoided body-slides as groups tumbled down the face of the Galgamond, still entangled in massive clumps. I had to cross waterfalls that were not made of water, and when I reached the lower levels of the writhing mass of the living, I had to fight off feral climbers who saw that I had food and water. I could not rest, I could not share and I had to keep going. The first time one of these encounters escalated to me kicking someone off of me, and watching them freefall to the lower levels to die, I felt another strand of myself snap inside my mind.\n\nI reached the upper levels of that part of the Galgamond and beheld an entirely new and unexpected horror. Here there was something, some kind of parody of human ingenuity and civilization, for the few who lived at that level had taken from the dead and fashioned crude battlements of bone, forming a kind of rest stop. I was forced to sell some of my water to gibbering things that looked like human beings in exchange for safe passage, rest and the use of a rope made of human hair that allowed me to climb the steep section leading to the top.\n\nWhile I slept, they robbed me of the rest of my supplies but spared my life.\n\nI used the rope, despite the danger of it breaking and dropping me, for the peak was pushed up from the core of the mountain, an upheaval of corpses that were too sheer to climb. By the end of the fourth day, I had reached the top of the Galgamond.\n\nThere they sat, brooding, hulking and withering, the sentinels who had beaten the odds and made it to the summit, only by shedding all that made them once human. They stared at me, and I felt a deep loathing and horror that I cannot describe, for in their eyes were the broken parts of my unraveling consciousness. I too had started to become like them, although my rapid ascent had made me aware of the change. Below us was the entire mountain, countless victims of the Galgamond, and a gray fog.\n\nI slowly clambered past each one, until I reached the one who sat at the very top of the mountain. I could see he was expecting me, and had longed for this reunion, this release from the torment of being the highest point of the lowest state of humanity. Some part of him was in there behind that tortured gaze. He wanted it to be over, but the layers of survival had contradicted his own self. I hugged him, holding his broken and withered frame with love and remorse.\n\n\"It's okay,\" I told him. \"It's all over now.\"\n\nHe grunted his acceptance, and together we began our descent."},"64":{"title":"Christmas Nightmare House","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1haot6r\/christmas_nightmare_house\/","flair":"Story","author":"DJ_Storytime","selftext":"It was supposed to be a fun day visiting a Christmas village. Just the five of us, coworkers and the best of friends, out for a good time during the holidays. Maybe it would have been, but how were we supposed to know the festive house with all the lights and snow wasn\u2019t Santa\u2019s workshop?\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this wonderful?\u201d Clarissa, my wife, said as we entered the Christmas village.\n\nIt really was. An open field just outside of town had been converted into a sprawling replica of the north pole. The buildings were designed to look like quaint cottages and shops, complete with themes of toys and candy. Colored lights were draped everywhere, making the entire village sparkle and twinkle like a starburst of colors. Actors dressed up like Santa\u2019s helpers wandered about, playing roles, interacting with the customers, and hawking various souvenirs. There was even a petting zoo with reindeer, and an actual sleigh with nine reindeer hooked up, ready to take it on a tour through town for one of the scheduled candy parades. Finally, there was Santa himself, sitting on a throne atop a hill surrounded by decorated pine trees and brightly wrapped packages, greeting people and taking pictures with them.\n\nHow, then, could such a wonderful place harbor something so terrible as that house?\n\nMost of the day was wonderful. It was crisp Saturday, and we had been planning this outing as a group all week. It was a pure delight being part of the fun as my wife and friends excitedly toured the village.\u00a0 We did everything there was to do that day. We shopped in every store. We snacked in every restaurant and food stand. We played every game. We drank every warm, seasonal boozy beverage there was. We pet the reindeer. We took pictures with Santa. We role-played with the actors and generally goofed off.\n\nIt was a magical day, and then we found the workshop.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Joel asked curiously, pointing down a narrow, unused side street?\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s find out!\u201d Carol said, laughing and smiling. \u201cWhatever it is, I bet it\u2019s fun!\u201d\n\nWe all cheerily went along with her suggestion, singing Christmas carols as we made our tipsy way to the mystery place. What we saw when we got there was the most magical thing we had seen all day.\n\n\u201cThey really went all out here!\u201d John exclaimed excitedly. \u201cI can hardly believe it! They even got real little people to play the elves!\u201d\n\nI looked again. Sure enough, all of the actors playing the elves were unusually short. There couldn\u2019t have been one of them over four feet tall. They were busily working, rushing about like they were preparing for something big. \u201cUnreal,\u201d I said, and noticed my breath fog in front of me.\n\nClarissa hugged her arms around herself. \u201cIt\u2019s cold here. Why don\u2019t we go inside Santa\u2019s workshop? I bet its\u2019 fun!\u201d\n\nThe workshop looked exactly as one might imagine Santa\u2019s workshop to be. Red, white, green, silver, and gold were the colors. The architecture looked very fifteenth century, giving it a quaint appearance. There were snow men, small pine trees, and big candy canes scattered around the grounds. A warm light glowed inside, gently filtering out of the windows, and a thick curl of white smoke rose from the chimney like a serpentine cloud.\n\nAll of us were feeling the cold. The crisp air seemed to have taken a sudden plunge, and it only made the warm, festive building all the more appealing. We happily agreed that it looked like fun, and walked to it. The elves mostly seemed not to notice us as they rushed about their work, but I noticed one give us a stern look and a shake of his head and he rushed on by. Something about him seemed off, and I couldn\u2019t quite put my finger on what.\n\n\u201cHurry!\u201d John called as I paused to consider the strange behavior by this small man.\n\nI caught up as everyone reached the door. Joel opened it, and held it open as we all filed in.\n\nInside it was bright and warm. Not painfully bright like an office with too much overhead lighting, but comfortably bright, like an open field on an early Spring day. It smelled of sugar and baked goods.\n\nThe entry was an open room, festively decorated with a reception and a door that led inside. Behind the desk was a small man dressed as an elf. He smiled at us and waved us over.\n\n\u201cBefore you enter the workshop, you need to sign the registry,\u201d he said in cheerful tone.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s inside?\u201d Carol asked curiously, eyeing the door behind the elf.\n\nThe little man smiled widely. \u201cIt\u2019s a place like no other,\u201d he said brightly. \u201cWhere the wonders never cease, and everyone gets what they deserve!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I deserve a million dollars!\u201d Joel said with a laugh. \u201cLet\u2019s sign this book and get on in there!\u201d\n\nWe were all there for a good time. We\u2019d been having a good time. So how could we possibly know, how could we have any reason to expect, that by signing that guest book, our wonderful day would become the stuff of nightmares?\n\nWe happily signed our pages on lines at the bottom of individual pages. Most of each page was covered in ornate calligraphy, so fancy that none of us could actually read it. At the bottom was a heavy line with an X in front of it, indicating that it was where we should sign. The paper felt like old vellum, and the pen was a proper fountain pen that ink flowed out of in a dark line that varied in thickness with every stroke.\n\nSomething wasn\u2019t sitting quite right in my mind. I couldn\u2019t put my finger on it, just a general sense that all was not as it seemed. \u201cWhat\u2019s this say?\u201d I asked as I was signing my name.\n\n\u201cStandard release,\u201d the elf said in a tone that indicated it didn\u2019t matter. \u201cYou know how these lawyers are, making everything into a liability.\u201d\n\nI laughed at this, as did my wife and John. Joel gave Clarissa a mock look of alarm, and she joined in the laughter. As soon as the last of us finished signing, the door opened, and we could see inside.\n\nThe ladies gasped, and the men\u2019s eyes grew wide in wonder. I wish I had the words to properly describe what we saw as we looked through that door, but it was everything any of us could have thought, hoped, and expected Santa\u2019s workshop to be. It was filled with toys, elves busily crafting them as they chatted cheerfully, laughed, and sang.\n\nThat\u2019s when I noticed what had seemed off to me before. \u201cGuys,\u201d I said hesitantly. \u201cThese dwarfs are proportioned like a full-size person, just shorter.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood for them,\u201d John said dismissively. \u201cNow let\u2019s get in there and enjoy the best workshop setup I\u2019ve ever seen!\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t share my friend\u2019s lack of concern. Normally, a person with dwarfism is not proportional to a full-sized person. Their heads are large compared to their bodies. Their limbs are short compared to their bodies too. These actors were more like pygmies. People who do not suffer from dwarfism but are still extraordinarily short. It\u2019s incredibly rare, and there was no way this seasonal fair should have been able to find so many.\n\n\u201cThe elves in the rest of the village are full-sized people. These people are all pygmies,\u201d I said with concern\/ \u201cSomething\u2019s-\u201c\n\n\u201cIn we go!\u201d my wife interrupted, and she pushed me through the door with everyone else following.\n\nAt first, everything was fine. At first everything was exactly as it had seemed from the other room. That is, until a new figure entered the room.\n\n\u201cLook!\u201d Carol squealed with excitement. \u201cIt\u2019s Santa!\u201d\n\nAnd at first it seemed to be. In walked a large man dressed in an old-fashioned Santa outfit, green and brown, the kind he was best known for before the Coke company popularized the red variant. He was a large man, with a thick, long white beard flowing out from under his hood. He carried a large sack over one shoulder, and in his other hand he held a shining scroll.\n\nHis face was hidden in the shadow of his hood with only his beard and the tip a long, pointed nose poking out. \u201cWelcome!\u201d he said in a deep, booming voice. \u201cIt is time to check your signatures against the list and see if you\u2019re naughty or nice!\u201d\n\nEveryone but me oohed and aahed in delighted anticipation. It was the nose. His nose wasn\u2019t right. Wasn\u2019t Santa\u2019s nose supposed to be like a button, not long and thin? I shook my head to clear the thought away. \u201cIt\u2019s not the real Santa,\u201d I muttered under my breath. \u201cGet over it!\u201d\n\nI convinced myself that it was just the actor. I couldn\u2019t expect every Santa actor to actually look perfectly like the mythical version of Saint Nick after all. It was a silly notion, an unreasonable expectation.\n\nAnd yet, this didn\u2019t feel like the fun fakery of the village outside. And . . . and just why was the biggest, most effortful, most important part of the who Christmas village tucked away from everything else, hidden down a narrow side street where anyone could miss it? Why wasn\u2019t it the literal center of town?\n\nThese thoughts raged through my skull, and I wanted to voice them, but I tamped down the urge telling myself that I was just being silly. That this strange paranoia was unfounded with no relation to reality.\n\n\u201cJoel Donaldson.\u201d Santa announced in that booming voice. \u201cYours is the first name signed. Time to see if you\u2019re naughty or nice.\u201d\n\nJoel stepped forward with a comical flourish. I noticed that his face was radiant with a blend of happiness and just a little bit too much alcohol consumed in our day of revels. \u201cI\u2019m ready for my present!\u201d he announced with all the innocence and expectation of someone who truly thought that was right in the world.\n\n\u201cYou will get your just reward,\u201d Santa declared somberly. He held up the scroll in front of him and let it unfurl. He read it aloud. \u201cJoel Donaldson, you are on the . . . naughty list!\u201d\n\n\u201cOoooo,\u201d Joel said mockingly with a smile and a wave of his hands.\n\nThe elves all stopped working and began to gather around us. They sang \u201cNaughty list! Naughty list! You are on the naughty list!\u201d over and over again as they surrounded Joel, big, truly joyful smiles plastered across their smooth faces.\n\nSanta stepped aside revealing a chair that had not been there before. \u201cCome!\u201d He commanded. \u201cReceive your reward!\u201d\n\nThe elves crowded in around Joel and began pushing him forward toward the chair. \u201cNaughty list! Naughty list! You are on the naughty list!\u201d they continued to sing.\n\nJoel laughed and went along with it, believing that nothing was out of place, and it was all just part of the show. He walked past Santa and plopped himself down in the chair.\n\nThat was the moment when the truth of our situation revealed itself.\n\nHeavy spiked leather straps erupted out of the chair and wrapped themselves around Joel, trapping him and pining him down. They squeezed and tightened around his legs and torso, and pinpricks of blood began to stain his clothing in slowly spreading circles of red.\n\nHe screamed in surprise and pain. \u201cWhat are you doing to me?\u201d he yelled, pain cracking his voice as he thrashed his head and swatted futilely at the straps binding him to the chair.\n\nThe elves laughed musically and began to chant. \u201cNaughty list! Naughty list!\u201d the tone becoming increasingly menacing with every syllable.\n\nThe floor opened up in front of Joel, and a large, ornate office desk stacked with papers and writing implements rose up before him.\n\nThe elves\u2019 chanting ceased as Santa began to speak. \u201cJoel Donaldson,\u201d He announced in a tone was both businesslike and filled with malice. \u201cYou have been a naughty boy! You have been stealing from your employer, using your position as accountant to cook the books and move money from the business to your personal accounts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done no such thing!\u201d Joel insisted. \u201cLet me out of here! I swear to God I\u2019m going to sue you into oblivion!\u201d\n\nThe rest of us were too stunned to say or do anything. What could we do? This was supposed to be a fun day. It was supposed to be safe and innocent, just five friends from work having a good time at the fair. We couldn\u2019t properly process this sudden turn of events, and we stood transfixed in horror as the scene unfolded before us.\n\nSanta laughed at Joel\u2019s futile threat. There was no merriment in it. It was a deep belly laugh, but it was filled with such malice that I hesitate to call it a laugh at all, but there is no better word to describe it.\n\nThe straps tightened and moved, scraping across Joel like a sandpaper belt, shredding his clothing and the skin beneath. He thrashed and screamed in pain, and blood began to flow more freely.\n\nAn elf walked up and placed an old quill pen in Joel\u2019s right hand before sliding a leatherbound ledger across the desk in front of him.\n\nJoel protested and dropped the pen. The straps tightened and raked him some more in response to his defiance before the elf picked up the pen and put it back in his hand.\n\n\u201cYour punishment is to find the errors and correct the balances in these books,\u201d Santa said with finality. \u201cEvery one of them is the result of a dishonest man lying and abusing his position his position to steal, just like you. I know you\u2019re accustomed to different tools for your trade, but I\u2019m afraid that you\u2019ll just have to complete this task the old-fashioned way.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if I refuse?\u201d Joel said through teeth gritted in pain.\n\nThe straps raked him again and he screamed.\n\nSanta chuckled evilly. \u201cIf you refuse, the straps will punish you. If you make a mistake, the straps will punish you. If you fall asleep, the straps will punish you. Make enough mistakes, and the straps won\u2019t stop. They will drag across your body and tighten until they have cut you to ribbons.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Joel screeched as the chair slammed forward so hard that he would have slammed his head into it if his tors had not been tightly strapped to the chair, pinning him against the desk.\n\n\u201cNaughty list! Naughty list!\u201d the elves sang again. \u201cYou are on the naughty list!\u201d\n\nI watched as Joel reached forward with a shaking hand and took hold of a paper sitting atop one of the large piles. When he pulled his hand back, a bunch of the papers fell to the desk, and the straps on the chair reacted, slicing across his body like a belt sander.\n\nSanta\u2019s booming laugh drowned out my friend\u2019s screams as the door to the next room opened. The four of us who were still free to move screamed in unison and ran back to the door we came in through, desperately trying to escape this nightmare version of Santa\u2019s workshop. It was sealed shut, refusing to open no matter how hard we pulled, pushed, or battered against it. The only response to our screams for help was the laughter of Santa accompanied by the joyful singing of the elves as they continued their refrain of condemnation.\n\n\u201cYou must go forward!\u201d Santa commanded. \u201cGo forward and receive your just reward!\u201d\n\nWe continued our futile attempt at escape a while longer, but stopped when the elves crowded around us and began to push us to the open doorway to the next room. \u201cJust reward! Just reward!\u201d they chanted.\n\nJoel screamed again as the wicked chair responded to some error he made, and I knew then that he was never meant to survive the task set before him, but to be slowly killed as he desperately tried to complete an impossible task.\n\nThe four of us tumbled through the door and into the next room to the sound of booming laughter over chants of \u201cJust reward!\u201d The door slammed shut behind us as the lights came on, bathing us in a gentle glow while we desperately pounded at the closed door, screaming to be let out.\n\nThe sound of many people talking stopped us, and we turned around in morbid curiosity to see what was going on.\n\nThe room was filled with people stuffed into old-fashioned telephone booths. They were babbling nonsense into the receivers with pained looks on their faces. Once in a while, one of them would drop the phone in a coughing fit and spit up a great gout of blood before picking the receiver up again and babbling some more.\n\nA column of elves filed into the room from a hidden door. Wicked smiles plastered across their faces, they went about the room checking the phone booths, performing repairs, and washing out blood by connecting a hose to a nozzle on the outside of the phone booth that caused the water to spray right into the person\u2019s face at high volume, rinsing away the blood by sheer volume of water that drained out the bottom to God-knows-where.\n\nBooming laughter announced the arrival of Santa Claus, as he approached us from behind the phone booths. \u201cCarol Jenkins,\u201d he announced. \u201cTime to see if you\u2019ve been naughty or nice!\u201d\n\nHe raised the hand with the scroll, but before he let it unfurl, I called out.\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d I pleaded. \u201cWhat kind of Santa\u2019s workshop is this? Santa doesn\u2019t hurt people! The worst he does is give coal naughty children!\u201d\n\nLooking back, I know it was a pointless question. Silly even. Our captors were going to do what they intended with or without explanation. What did it matter if the man before us wasn\u2019t actually Santa Claus? Why would it matter anyway? This was supposed to be a fair with nothing but human actors. Humans don\u2019t follow Saint Nick rules.\n\nOnly the truth was even worse than any of us imagined.\n\nThe man dressed as Santa laughed. Not his usual booming laugh, but a low menacing laugh. \u201cSanta Claus?\u201d he chuckled. \u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m Santa Clause? Is it the robe?\u201d\n\nHe stood to his full height then, and he towered above us all. He pulled back his hood and grinned like a jack-o-lantern. \u201cBehold!\u201d he commanded in his booming voice. \u201cI am Krampus, and I punish the wicked!\u201d\n\nWe all stared in horror at the giant before us. His face was like gnarled wood, old and weathered, with hollow features, a long pointy nose, and deep, sharp eyes that seemed to look right through us. He dropped his bag and removed his gloves, revealing gnarled, knobby hands tipped with clawlike nails. The bag opened when it fell, revealing its contents to be nothing but stout reeds and human bones.\n\n\u201cI am not here to reward the nice list!\u201d he continued. \u201cI bear only the naughty list. If your name is on it, you will be properly rewarded for your behavior. It will be your just reward, and justice is harsh.\u201d\n\nCarol\u2019s eyes opened wide, and her mouth worked rapidly, trying to speak, but failing to form any words.\n\nKrampus again lifted the scroll and let it unfurl. \u201cCarol Jenkins,\u201d he announced. \u201cYou are on . . . the naughty list!\u201d\n\nAs he announced this, the elves in the room began to sing. \u201cNaughty list! Naughty list! You are on the naughty list!\u201d\n\nThey surged around her and pushed and carried her to Krampus as she screamed in terror.\n\n\u201cYou are a gossip.\u201d Krampus declared. \u201cYou spread rumors and falsehoods about others without regard for the harm you\u2019re doing. You destroy people\u2019s names, reputations, and relationships with your wicked tongue!\u201d\n\nShe struggled against the elves to no avail. As soon as she was close enough, Krampus reached out and snatched her up with one great, gnarled hand and pulled her in close.\n\n\u201cAs punishment, you must confess the truth to every one of your victims,\u201d he said in a threatening tone.\n\nThe floor next to them opened and a new phone booth rose up.\n\n\u201cNaughty list! Naughty list!\u201d the elves chanted.\n\n\u201cBut you won\u2019t be using that lying tongue.\u201d he continued. \u201cA tool of deceit has no place in honest confession!\u201d\n\nCarol struggled in his grasp and started to scream for help, but Krampus shot his free hand forward and shoved his fingers into her open mouth. Her mouth was forced open wider than it could naturally go, and her mouth tore open into a wide, jagged smile and Krampus closed his fingers around her tongue. With a swift yank, he ripped her tongue out. Blood sprayed out of her mouth as she screamed in agony.\n\nKrampus dropped her tongue and held out his hand. A smiling elf ran forward and placed a small candy cane in it. He took the piece of candy and shoved it into Carol\u2019s mouth. The bleeding stopped instantly.\n\nIt was no mercy though as Krampus immediately threw her into the phone booth and closed the door. \u201cCall them!\u201d he commanded. \u201cOnce you confess your slander to all of your victims, you\u2019re free to go.\u201d\n\nCarol beat on the door, desperately trying to break free. It was pointless. She was as trapped as the rest of the people in that room.\n\nA door opened at the far end of the room. \u201cGo,\u201d Krampus commanded, \u201cand receive your just reward!\u201d\n\nThe elves began to crowd around us again. They pushed and prodded us in the direction of the door. We reluctantly went. My wife broke down crying. Tears streamed down her face as she sobbed in great, shuddering gasps. John yelled in protest about how they couldn\u2019t do this to us. I was silent. None of it mattered anyway. We were trapped, well and truly, and no amount of protest, no flood of tears would change it.\n\nWe neared the door and were roughly shoved the last few steps. The door slammed shut as soon as we were through, leaving us enveloped in darkness.\n\nWe waited in silence for a few moments. The darkness was oppressive, and my anxiety climbed with every second. It could be hiding literally anything, and based on the horrors of the last two rooms, that anything was certain to be deeply disturbing at best, and outright horrifying at worst.\n\n\u201cH . . . hello?\u201d I called out to the darkness in a shuddering breath.\n\nAs if in response, there was a slow grinding sound as part of the wall dropped down, revealing a roaring fireplace.\n\nThe inferno lit the room in a dancing, ominous glow. It might have been a comforting glow under other circumstances, but after the previous two rooms, there was nothing it could be but a sign of foreboding. In the center of a room was a large wrought iron framed bed with chains at the head and foot. In place of a mattress was an iron slab. Beyond that, the room lay barren, empty of all signs of life or habitation.\n\nThe fire blazed even higher and belched out into the room, licking the bedframe for just a moment like the tongue of some arcane, hungry beast. As the fire retreated, a now-familiar, horrifying figure stepped out of the flames, followed by an entourage of those despicable elves.\n\nWithout any further fanfare, Krampus held out his scroll and dropped the bottom roll. \u201cJohn Valentine,\u201d he announced in that booming voice. \u201cYou are on the naughty list!\u201d\n\nThe elves were on him in an instant, singing that horrible chant, \u201cNaughty list! Naughty list! You are on the naughty list!\u201d as they grabbed him and lifted him overhead kicking and screaming. It was futile. Small as they were, the elves\u2019 grip was like iron, and all John could accomplish was wrenching his own back and shoulders painfully as the proceeded to the bed.\n\nThe elves chained him to the bed, iron manacles locked tight around his wrists and ankles, then they pulled the chains taught to splay him out and immobilize him.\n\nHe screamed in pain and terror as his shoulders and hips were dislocated with a series of loud pops.\n\n\u201cYou are guilty of adultery, many, many times,\u201d Krampus announced with malicious glee. \u201cYou lied to cover it up. You betrayed someone close to you, exploited his trust, and smiled as you deceived a friend!\u201d\n\nJohn was screaming in protest. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that!\u201d he protested. \u201cWe\u2019re in love! You can\u2019t blame me for being in love! Love is a beautiful thing!\u201d\n\nKrampus laughed wickedly. \u201cYou continue to lie even as you face just punishment for your crimes,\u201d he declared with absolute authority. \u201cYou never loved her. You had other women even as you took what didn\u2019t belong to you over, and over, and over again.\u201d\n\nI was stunned. The john I knew would never do something so heinous. He was a good, upright man, and the only one I trusted completely.\n\nI turned to my wife in shock. \u201cWho did he . . .\u201d my words caught in my throat as I saw my wife, my dear Clarissa, crying. Her mouth quivering with great sobs, and tears flowing like twin rivers from her bright green eyes, her head hung in shame.\n\n\u201cHe said he loved me,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cHe promised that he would make everything better and all of my problems would go away if chose to be with him,\u201d she sobbed. She looked at me with profound sadness and regret. \u201cIt was me,\u201d she confessed. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, it was me. The happiness I felt in our marriage wasn\u2019t there anymore, and he promised to make me happy again.\u201d\n\nHer words hit me like a bullet to the heart. My wife and my best friend? The two people in the world dearest to me, who I trusted with my life, betrayed me . . . together?\n\nI felt my own tears begin to well up and pour out of my eyes. \u201cWhy?\u201d I croaked, unable to think of anything else to say.\n\n\u201cI still love you,\u201d she said with sincerity. \u201cI always loved you. That never changed. But the magic was gone. I stopped being happy at the thought of you. The sweet things you do lost their magic and became routine. I wanted that happiness back. I craved the intensity of it, and he gave it to me. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer words were like a punch to the gut by a champion heavyweight boxer. I was left stunned, breathless, and unable to form a coherent thought.\n\n\u201cClarissa Hart,\u201d Krampus announced as if he had been waiting for this exact moment to speak. \u201cYou are on the naughty list!\u201d\n\nThe elves crowded around my wife. \u201cNaughty list! Naughty list! You are on the naughty list!\u201d they chanted gleefully as they grabbed her, lifted her up, and began to march toward the bed.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d I screamed. \u201cI forgive her!\u2019 I don\u2019t care what she did! We\u2019ll work it out! We\u2019ll find our happiness again! Don\u2019t take her from me! I love her!\u201d\n\nThe only response I got to my pleas was a continued chant of \u201cNaughty list! Naughty list! You are on the naughty list!\u201d as those demonic elves joyfully carried my wife, kicking, and screaming apologies and professions of her love for me to the iron bed.\n\n\u201cYou also are guilty of adultery, lying, and betrayal of the one person who loved and trusted you above all others,\u201d he declared. \u201cYour crimes were committed with the condemned man, therefore you will share his fate just as you shared your own marriage bed with him!\u201d\n\nThe elves shackled and stretched her exactly as they had to John. I turned away as she screamed in pain and terror, every pop of her joints sending a shudder of sorrow and regret through my body.\n\n\u201cYou must witness this,\u201d Krampus said to me in an almost sympathetic voice. \u201cShe would have left you anyway only to get her heart broken in betrayal. She cared far less for you than she did for her own selfish desires.\u201d\n\nI turned back to face the bed and lifted my head. All I could see through the haze of tears was blurry vision of a black lump of iron with two patches of color on top. I heard the sound of metal grating and sliding as floor plates moved, opening a blazing pathway from the fireplace to the bed one panel at a time.\n\nMy wife and my best friend screamed even louder and began to thrash, desperation overriding the pain in their dislocated limbs as they realized what was going to happen. Over it all, I could hear the booming sound of Krampus\u2019 voice as he declared \u201cYour bodies will burn together just as you burned with lust together!\u201d\n\nThe elves surrounded me and carried me bodily across the room to an newly opened door. They dumped me through it, and it slid shut just as I heard the screams of the two people I loved best intensify as the flames reached the underside of the bed and began to heat the iron slab they lay upon.\n\nI lay in a crumpled head for I don\u2019t know how long, sobbing with intense sorrow at all that I lost. My friends, my wife, all gone, victims of a demonic entity meeting out a twisted and final justice that nothing in me could reconcile as right or proper. We all fall short. We all make mistakes. None of us is truly innocent in this world, it\u2019s only a matter of degree and amount.\n\nEventually, I opened my eyes, stood up, and looked around.\n\nI was in a cozy sitting room. There was a perfectly ordinary fireplace with a non-threatening fir cheerily popping away. There was a table set with a fine feast. There was a long, overstuffed couch. The room was festively decorated with all the trimmings of a proper Christmas celebration.\n\nAnd in a very large chair sat the demon Krampus, patiently waiting for me to notice him.\n\n\u00a0\u201cTake a seat,\u201d he said gently, motioning to the couch with one large, bony hand.\n\nSeeing no other course of action, I obeyed.\n\n\u201cYou are not on the naughty list,\u201d he declared with a soft authority, the wickedly mirthful booming voice somehow absent.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I replied dumbly, my mind not comprehending what I had just heard after seeing my wife and friends sentenced to torment and death.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not fully innocent,\u201d Krampus explained. \u201cBut minor infractions do not condemn a man, therefore, you are not on the naughty list.\u201d\n\nI sat there in stunned silence expecting it to be some sort of malicious joke at my expense. I expected those horrible elves to show and start chanting about me being on the naughty list as they dragged me off to be tortured and killed.\n\nIt didn\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I croaked after I finally found my voice.\n\n\u201cYou think me a demon,\u201d Krampus stated. \u201cThat\u2019s understandable, but I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d I said in soft confusion.\n\n\u201cKrampus nodded his head. \u201cAnd you never truly will,\u201d he replied. \u201cAll you need to know is that I am tasked with rewarding people for the evil acts they commit. \u201cNot evil by any human understanding, but according to a universal truth that many deny even exists\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat even is that?\u201d I asked softly.\n\n\u201cThe universe operates under certain rules,\u201d Krampus explained. \u201cGood and evil exist because of those rules. Good is whatever follows the rules, and evil is whatever breaks them. The catch is that your kind is bound to break them. The only question is which rules you break, and how often.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know why, but something about being told that good and evil are universal and unchanging, that humanity has no say in the matter, incensed me. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t give you the right to just murder people!\u201d I shouted, all of my pain, sadness, and rage coming out in a single exhausting burst.\n\nI slumped back in my chair. Completely spent, suddenly helpless and uncaring. \u201cJust kill me and get it over with,\u201d I sighed. \u201cStop toying with me.\u201d\n\nKrampus chuckled, a real one, like he genuinely found me funny\/ \u201cI\u2019m not going to kill you,\u201d he declared with finality. \u201cYou\u2019re not on the naughty list. Instead, I\u2019m going to give you a gift.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t have time to aske what he meant by \u201cgift\u201d before he was on me. He grabbed a hold of the front of my shirt with one mighty hand and lifted me up. Then with his free hand he pulled back his hood to reveal that among his other horrifying features, he had horns like a goat, and this, straggly hair that seemed to flow and move of its own volition. He opened his mouth, and it stretched wider than any mortal man\u2019s mouth ever could, so wide that I thought he meant to eat me in a single gulp.\n\nThen he breathed.\n\nHe breathed on me, a deep sighing breath that seemed to have no end. I reeked of carrion rot smothered with mint and cloves. I tried to hold my breath to avoid breathing the foul fumes, but it wasn\u2019t long before I found myself taking in a great gasp of air as my body overrode my mind and forced me to breathe whether I wanted to or not.\n\nAt first, I felt nothing other than simple revulsion. I gagged on the foul breath and coughed like my lungs wanted to jump out my mouth. Then it subsided, and I found myself inhaling. I inhaled like never before, seeming to have no limit to how much air I could take in. I inhaled until every last foul fume that Krampus emitted was sucked in, and then he dropped me to the floor.\n\nI lay there coughing and sputtering as though my body were now rejecting the clean air now that Krampus had finished fumigating me. Krampus stood looming over me like the specter of death himself until I settled down and stood again on my own two feet.\n\nI looked up and saw his hood drawn far forward yet again, like it had been when I first laid eyes upon him. His eyes glowed like embers in the darkness. He said nothing, waiting as if in expectation.\n\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d I asked, coughing as I spoke.\n\nA door that I had not noticed before opened up to reveal a familiar, snowy landscape. \u201cNow you go out into the world and see it for what it truly is,\u201d he said in a voice that grew deeper and more foreboding with every word. \u201cThat is your gift. You will always know the truth about the people you meet. Never again will you be deceived.\u201d\n\nI started to speak up, to ask what he meant by his statement, but he hushed me and pointed to the door. \u201cGo!\u201d he commanded in that booming voice I had come to know and dread. Leave my workshop and never return!\u201d\n\nI turned and walked out the door and into the Christmas village. All was as it had been before we found and entered that wicked workshop. People were blissfully enjoying the fair in the cold winter air, a recent layer of snow coating the land with a cozy, frozen blanket.\n\nI turned around, and the workshop was gone. Where it once stood was a town center filled with bustling shops and Christmas themed carnival games. A drink vendor was off to one calling out for people to come and enjoy hot spiced mead and mulled wine to warm their bodies on a cold winter day.\n\nI needed a drink, and I hurried over to the vendor fully intending to order a hot mug of mulled wine when I noticed something that stopped me in my tacks. I did a double-take, looking at the man in stunned disbelief. I couldn\u2019t properly explain it, but as plainly as though it was written all over his face, I knew things about the man that I had no logical way to know.\n\nI knew beyond all doubt that this was a con man. I knew that he served cheap drinks that he labelled as expensive premium ones. I knew that he was a habitual liar who lacked an honest bone in his body. I knew that he sweet talked many a gullible young woman into his bad for his own amusement with false promises and declaration of affection before moving on to a new town where he did it all again.\n\nI knew that he had murdered his own mother and made it look like a falling accident so he could collect her life insurance before the term expired. I knew about the vial of oleander toxin he kept hidden in his inside coat pocket so he could poison the occasional drunk, knowing it would look like a heart attack and the coroner was unlikely to look any deeper.\n\n\u201cWhat can I get for you?\u201d the man said cheerily, a wide smile splayed across his face.\n\n\u201cDo you have anything stronger than wine?\u201d I asked, suddenly wanting nothing to do with anything this man touched.\n\nHe pointed behind me to a small building simply marked \u201cBar\u201d. Go there if you want liquor,\u201d he said with the same cheer and smile he\u2019d originally had.\n\nI thanked him and left, heading to the bar at first, then turning down the street and leaving, wanting nothing more than to put as much distance between myself and the Christmas village as humanly possible."},"65":{"title":"Elf on the Shelf","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1h9z3aj\/elf_on_the_shelf\/","flair":"Story","author":"Verlac_1","selftext":"December in Ridgewood was always perfect. Lights on every house, wreaths on every door, and the faint smell of pine in the crisp winter air. I loved this time of year, and so did my family.\n\nWe were unpacking decorations when Emma, my wife, pulled something from the bottom of the box. It was an old Elf on the Shelf, its red felt clothes faded and its painted eyes staring up at her.\n\n\u201cWhere did this come from?\u201d she asked, holding it up.\n\n\u201cMaybe your mom put it in there?\u201d I suggested with a shrug. \u201cJust put it out. The kids will love it.\u201d\n\nEmma hesitated but eventually placed the elf on the mantel above the fireplace. Max and Lily, our kids, were thrilled.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d Max asked.\n\n\u201cJingles!\u201d Lily announced, clapping her hands.\n\nEmma gave a faint smile, though she looked uneasy. Later that evening, while we were settling down for the night, she grabbed her phone and read aloud, \u201cThere are rules for these things, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cRules?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s part of the Elf on the Shelf tradition. Kids aren\u2019t supposed to touch it, or it loses its magic. The elf moves to a new spot every night, and it\u2019s supposed to watch the kids to make sure they\u2019re behaving. It reports back to Santa.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of creepy if you think about it.\u201d\n\nI chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s just a toy, Emma. Don\u2019t overthink it.\u201d\n\nBut I couldn\u2019t deny there was something unsettling about it, something about those painted eyes that felt too watchful.\n\nThe first night, Emma woke me up around 3 a.m.\n\n\u201cI heard something,\u201d she whispered.\n\nI groaned. \u201cIt\u2019s probably nothing.\u201d\n\nBut she insisted, so I followed her downstairs. The Christmas tree cast a warm glow over the living room. Everything looked normal, except for Jingles.\n\nEmma froze. \u201cDid you move him?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, frowning.\n\nThe elf was leaning forward on the mantel. I couldn\u2019t remember how Emma had positioned him, but she was certain he hadn\u2019t been like that.\n\n\u201cThe kids probably touched him,\u201d I said, trying to calm her down. But her unease lingered, and to be honest, something about the way Jingles\u2019 eyes caught the light made my skin crawl, too.\n\nAt 2 a.m. on the second night, Max woke up screaming.\n\nI ran to his room, Emma right behind me. He was shaking, tears streaming down his face.\n\n\u201cIt was him!\u201d Max sobbed, pointing to the corner of the room. \u201cJingles! He was here! He was staring at me!\u201d\n\nI turned and saw the elf sitting on Max\u2019s dresser, his painted grin illuminated by the moonlight.\n\nEmma looked at me, her face pale. \u201cHow did it get in here?\u201d she whispered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the kids messing around,\u201d I said though my voice had a hint of doubt. I grabbed Jingles and brought him back downstairs, tossing him onto the mantel.\n\nAs I set him down, I swear I felt resistance, like his tiny arms clung to my fingers for a moment before letting go. I didn\u2019t tell Emma. She was already rattled enough.\n\nThe next morning, Emma tried to convince me to leave. \u201cSomething is wrong, Greg,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cWe should go, at least for a few days.\u201d\n\nI almost agreed just to keep the peace, but when I checked our bank account, I realized leaving wasn\u2019t an option. Christmas had drained us, and we didn\u2019t have the extra money for a hotel. \u201cWe can\u2019t just leave the house,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019d have to pack, and where would we even go?\u201d\n\nEmma pressed on. \u201cWhat about my sister\u2019s?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think the kids will want to leave all their decorations and presents behind?\u201d I countered. \u201cPlus, your sister isn\u2019t really a huge fan of me so I\u2019d rather not spend Christmas constantly arguing with a brick wall. You\u2019re just stressed, Em. It\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d\n\nShe reluctantly dropped the subject, but the tension in the house was unbearable.\n\nAt 3 a.m. on the third night, I woke to Emma screaming.\n\nI ran into the kitchen and froze. \u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d was scrawled across the walls in jagged, crimson letters. At first, I thought it was paint, until I saw the bloody pawprints leading to the backyard.\n\nSnowball, our cat, lay in the snow, her neck twisted at an impossible angle. Emma collapsed into my arms, sobbing.\n\nI called the police, but they found nothing; no signs of a break-in, no footprints other than ours. Absolute squat. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably just some sick prank,\u201d the officer said, though he looked me up and down with suspicious eyes.\n\nWhen we came back inside, Jingles was sitting on the kitchen counter. His head was tilted slightly, his smile wider than before.\n\n\u201cGreg, we need to leave,\u201d Emma said.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d I replied, feeling the weight of it all. \u201cThe cops are already suspicious, and what do we say? That a doll is doing this? They\u2019ll think we\u2019re crazy. We\u2019ll figure this out.\u201d\n\nThe power went out around midnight on the fourth night. I woke to the sound of faint, childlike giggles echoing through the house.\n\n\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d Emma whispered, clutching my arm.\n\nI grabbed a flashlight and crept downstairs, my pulse pounding in my ears. The beam of light swept across the living room and landed on the wall.\n\nScrawled there in jagged letters was:\n\n\u201cHe sees you when you\u2019re sleeping\u2026\u201d\n\nMy stomach twisted. The couch cushions were slashed open, stuffing spilling onto the floor.\n\nThen I heard it: a soft scuttling sound behind me. I spun around and froze.\n\nAt the base of the stairs stood Jingles.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t sitting anymore. He was standing.\n\nHis painted eyes gleamed in the flashlight beam, and his grin, it wasn\u2019t the harmless painted smile I remembered. It had stretched into a jagged, open maw, revealing rows of needle-like teeth.\n\nEmma screamed behind me.\n\nBy the fifth night, I was at my breaking point. I begged Emma to take the kids and leave, but she wouldn\u2019t. \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving you. We all leave or none of us do,\u201d she said.\n\nAt 2 a.m., the screams started.\n\nI bolted to Lily\u2019s room and found her bed empty. The window was wide open, snow blowing in and covering the floor. Outside, small footprints led into the woods.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I whispered, panic clawing at my chest. \u201cNo, no, no!\u201d\n\nI ran to Max\u2019s room. His bed was soaked in blood, the sheets a crimson mess. I staggered backward, bile rising in my throat.\n\n\u201cWhy are you doing this?!\u201d Emma screamed from behind me.\n\nI turned to see her staring at the doorway.\n\nJingles stood there.\n\nBut he wasn\u2019t the doll anymore. He was life-sized, his red suit darkened with blood. His painted eyes glinted with malice, and his mouth stretched wider than should have been possible. In one hand, he held a razor-sharp candy cane, the tip dripping with blood.\n\nHe tilted his head, his painted face twisting into something alive and cruel. \u201c \u2018Tis the season,\u201d he whispered.\n\nI lunged at him, grabbing the fireplace poker and swinging with everything I had. The blow sent him flying into the wall.\n\nFor a moment, I thought it was over, until I heard Emma scream.\n\nI turned to see Jingles standing behind her, his twisted grin even wider. He raised the candy cane high, and I ran toward her, shouting, \u201cNo!\u201d\n\nBut I was too late.\n\nHer scream was cut short as the light in her eyes faded. I dropped the poker, my hands trembling as Jingles turned toward me, his mouth curling into a silent laugh.\n\nI don\u2019t remember much after that. Just darkness.\n\nWhen I woke, the house was quiet. Emma was gone. Max and Lily were gone. The only thing left was Jingles, sitting on the mantel, his painted eyes gleaming with satisfaction.\n\nAnd in the corner of the room, I noticed two new dolls\u2014one with Max\u2019s brown hair and one with Lily\u2019s blonde curls.\n\nI stumbled out of the house, tears streaming down my face, with the sound of a high pitched giggle echoing behind me.  \n\nI don\u2019t know why Jingles came to our family. I don\u2019t know what purpose he came with, I just know that the last I saw, Jingles was still in that house\u2026and he was waiting for his next family\u2026."},"66":{"title":"Erased by Google","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1h9w0cx\/erased_by_google\/","flair":"Story","author":"DJ_Storytime","selftext":"Hello. My name is.\n\nLet\u2019s try that again. My name is.\n\nOkay, my name is irrelevant, not that you\u2019d remember it if you did read it, or even if I told you in person. It\u2019s an effect of my condition. I've had years to get used to it, but I still sometimes forget the . . . restrictions on my life. Restrictions, and a strange kind of freedom that comes with them. But before we talk about where I am now, let me tell you how it all began.\n\nI love Google. Through it I have the knowledge if the world at my fingertips. All of the information accumulated by humanity can be found if you know how to use it.\u00a0 Want to know how to bake some delicious chocolate chip cookies? Google it. Want to learn an ancient ritual for summoning the spirits of the dead? Google it. Want to find me, my name, or any evidence that I really exist? Don\u2019t bother.\n\nNo. I\u2019m not a secret government agent who had his presence on the web meticulously scrubbed by geniuses for my own protection.\u00a0 And no. I didn\u2019t do it myself or have it done for me due to any affiliation with a criminal organization. It was done involuntarily, and near as I can tell, irreversibly. But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself.\n\nGoogle used to love me back. For years my website was one of the most trafficked in the world. It was on the first page of search results whenever people were looking for information about controversial topics. Science, religion, politics, and history were my forte. If there was strong disagreement or conspiracy theories surrounding a topic, my website was a top tier source of information, and people used it in numbers comparable to any three mainstream news outlets combined. When there was a story on my site, it would be shared widely through social media, and linked to hundreds, sometimes thousands of smaller sites that would use mine as a primary source of information.\n\nIt was beautiful, magnificent even. I was trusted by all the right people, and I was proud to bursting of what I had accomplished. I was in the elite of the internet, the virtual version of being a champion Olympic athlete.\n\nAnd it was full of crap.\n\nI was a troll extraordinaire. I gave the world bad information. I did it on purpose. I reveled in the social chaos that was the result of my magnificent prank on the gullible and ignorant masses searching for confirmation bias, and validation of their mistaken or groundless beliefs. I gave them what they wanted. I fed it to them like a parent spooning from a jar into the mouth of a hungry, ever so trusting baby. In exchange I gained money and fame in equally generous amounts. The great scam artists of history: P.T. Barnum, Charles Ponzi, and their ilk would have envied me if they were alive today.\n\nDo you remember how huge the story of Hillary Clinton being outed as a lesbian who lets her husband go tomcatting around so she can fulfill true carnal desires was back in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary? No. Of course you don\u2019t. It was one of my stories. An extraordinary hoax, complete with faked photos that cratered her poll numbers and moved the DNC to use their superdelegates to pave the way the way for the first interracial American president, and it\u2019s as if I never existed. Sure, the effect it had on the world remains intact, but nobody remembers the real reason why. It\u2019s as though there is a collective delusion to fill in the blank space where my work once held full credit, and all that remains are rumors of her closeted homosexuality among her political enemies.\n\nPerhaps you\u2019re familiar with the 9-11 Truth movement. I didn\u2019t start that one, so you should remember it just fine. Thing is, I\u2019m the one who gave it legs. I was searching the internet for stories for my site. I needed one with enough backing to be believable, but also so unlikely to be true that I could use it to play with people\u2019s heads, and I came across this obscure gem. A conspiracy that the U.S. government took down that World Trade Center itself and blamed terrorists so it could start a war for oil that it never claimed as the spoils of war. It was pure gold.\n\nMany people credit Alex Jones with popularizing this conspiracy theory.\u00a0 Well, he first learned about it from me, not that he remembers. We were buddies back then. Like me he never met a crazy conspiracy he didn\u2019t like. Unlike me, he actually believed them then, and he believes them now. I mean, seriously. The government is poisoning the water to make the frogs gay? How funny is that? We had so much fun together! I miss him.\n\nSo how it is then that you have no idea who I am?\n\nGoogle has been working to improve the reliability of its search results practically from the day it launched.\u00a0 Their product may be you, and everything you think is private so that they can sell your life to advertisers, but the lure that gets you to willingly give it to them is all that sweet free information in an easy to use, convenient, and reliable search engine that gives you exactly what you want. Chief among them being good, reliable information.\n\nMy website represented the exact opposite of this ideal. Hucksterism was my game, and deceit was my trade.\n\nAnd business was good.\n\nNowadays, making money on a website can be challenging. The price of advertising is lower than it used to be, and people are less prone to clicking though ads. That\u2019s where the real money is. You might get a pittance for eyes on, but it\u2019s click throughs that really get you paid. Back when I started the money flowed like water. If you had a popular website you could go from a nobody to a millionaire with 300 employees in just a few years if you played your cards right.\n\nI never hired anyone. That meant that I was basically chained to my computer every waking hour, but it also meant that I got to keep all of the money I made for myself . . . well, after Uncle Sam swooped in to take a grossly unfair portion of the fruits of my labors. Seriously. In what world is it fair to spend 3-6 months of your life every year working for free because some government goon is taking your money from you at gunpoint? How is that different from slave labor?\n\nBut I digress.\n\nThe point is, I was a one-man operation. Nobody was tied to my business but me. So don\u2019t go around trying to figure out if that money I used to have is still tied to my or my business in any way. I assure you that it is not. I honestly have no idea what happened to my money. Where to millions of dollars go when they don\u2019t belong to anyone? Perhaps Google took it. Maybe it was simply sucked into the infinitely hungry black money hole that is the federal government. Maybe it was simply deleted from existence. Our money is mostly digital these days anyway. Erase a bank account, erase the money. Regardless, my fortune vanished without a trace. Every penny earned over years of endless work gone in the blink of an eye.\n\nGoogle was a multiplied blessing for me. It served both as my primary means of gathering information, and as my primary means of spreading my own brand of misinformation.\n\nThat said, if something isn\u2019t on Google, not just buried and hard to locate, but genuinely missing entirely, does it really exist at all? If all of the information in the world, all of the known information, study, events, and general information of human history is online and searchable through Google, what does it mean if it can\u2019t be found? And, relevant to my won story, what does it mean that I can\u2019t be found?\n\nIt all happened in an instant, in one of those moments that should be entirely unremarkable, and, in this case, ironically forgettable. Forgettable for you, but never for me.\n\nI sat down at my computer one morning, logged in, and opened Google so I could check for anything useful may have come up while I slept. I had every expectation that the same thing would happen that day as had happened every single day for years. It should have perfectly and satisfyingly ordinary with another day of bland but happy research, writing, and posting wonderfully deceptive stories for the hungry, gullible masses.\n\nImagine my surprise then, when I opened up my Google homepage and was greeted with the following message: \u201dYou have been deleted for intentionally spreading false and misleading information.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I muttered, mouth agape in confusion and surprise. This isn\u2019t April first. What kind of joke is this?\n\nI navigated to my website to log in and do a little work only to be greeted by the nonexistent domain error message. \u201cHmmm . . . Can\u2019t reach that page? Odd. Lemme Google it.\u201d So I did. I googled my own website and the search result was fruitless. No matter how I searched, no matter my search terms, I got no results that included my own website, and often I got no results at all. I searched myself and found other randos with the same name, but not the most famous one: me.\n\nFrustrated, I went to Twitter to complain to my legions of followers. Every login attempt just got me the \u201cFailed login: Username and Password do not match\u201d message. I searched my account name without logging in, and there were no results to be found.\n\nI went to Facebook with the exact same result. I tried to log into my various email accounts, and they all failed the same way. I attempted to recover my accounts with my usernames and a password reset link texted to my phone, but they all had the same result. \u201cIncorrect Username\u201d.\n\nI broadened my search for anything I could still log into. World of Warcraft? Gone! Amazon? Gone! YouTube? Gone! Bank accounts, utilities, online subscriptions, credit card accounts, and anything that I could normally access online? Gone, gone, gone, gone, and oh-so-gone!\n\nI ran a virus scan on all of my devices and they came back clean. I repeated the scan with three additional antivirus programs, and all came back clean as well.\n\nI restarted my computers, phone, and every other net connected device I owned. When that failed I tried resetting my computer only to be completely unable to properly set it up again due to, you guessed it, no Microsoft account.\n\n\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d I screamed impotently as my computer rejected my login credentials. I pulled out my cellphone to call customer support, dialed the number swiftly and surely, my fingers stabbing the screen with quick, angry jabs. I put the phone to my ear and . . . nothing. Absolutely nothing! Not even a lousy \u201cThis phone number is no longer in service\u201d recording. Just plain nothing!\n\nI tried to open some apps to see if the phone had anything actually working. They all opened, but they all had forgotten me and had asked me to set up a new user account.\n\n\u201cDamn it!\u201d I shrieked as I violently hurled my very expensive iPhone into my equally expensive oversized Ultra HD monitor. They both broke gloriously, bits and pieces flying off in random directions as I growled impatiently through gritted teeth.\n\n\u201cThis is crap!\u201d I angrily declared to nobody after I regained a modicum of composure. \u201cI\u2019m going to the library. Maybe I can get some work done from their computers while I get this sorted out!\u201d\n\nI got dressed. Yes, I actually did do most of my work in my underwear and a bathrobe. Yes, I knew it made me a living stereotype, but I was too rich and influential to care. Who was going to see me anyway? I worked alone out of my home office. I grabbed my wallet and keys and hurried out my front door. My next-door neighbor happened to be taking out his trash at the same time. \u201cGood morning, Jim!\u201d I hurriedly greeted as I rushed to my car.\n\nI didn\u2019t fully comprehend his response at the time. My mind was wholly preoccupied by my mysterious computer problems. He gave me a confused look, cocking his head to one side and saying nothing as he hesitantly raised his free and gave me a halfhearted wave hello.\n\nI slid into the driver\u2019s seat and slammed the car door shut. \u201cI swear, when I find out who\u2019s responsible for messing up my computer like this, he\u2019s a dead man!\u201d I groused as I keyed the ignition. The engine roared to life, and the sound of the powerful motor soothed me slightly.\n\nI love my car, and I tried several times to describe it here for you, but apparently that would give you enough information to identify me. So just trust me when I tell you that you\u2019d love to have a car like mine. Sadly, it seems that the page simply will not allow me to commit something that could allow people to pick me out in a crowd to print. Hence, I am reduced to speaking in generalities rather the details of my gorgeous, crazy fast, super sexy car for you so you could form the proper mental picture of this enviable machine. As it is, just imagine whatever car you think is gorgeous, super sexy, and crazy fast. You might even manage to picture mine.\n\nI slammed the car in reverse, zipped out into the street without bothering to look. Yes, I know I could have killed someone, but at the moment I didn\u2019t really care. Once on the road, I slammed the car in gear, floored the gas, and sped down the street like a two-ton bullet.\n\nYes, I was driving recklessly and I didn\u2019t care. Have you ever been so thoroughly pissed off that you were fine with endangering other people and yourself in your fit of foolish rage? That was me. My world had just been upended, so I honestly didn\u2019t care if I upended someone else\u2019s world. Misery does love company after all.\n\nI roared into the library parking lot in a third of the time it should have taken me to arrive and came to a screeching stop in the handicapped space. Spaces actually. I double parked. I was going too fast to fully stop in time, and I took out the handicapped sign and put a decent dent in the bumper of my year, make, and model I can\u2019t tell you super-expensive sports car.\n\nThe minor miracle of having broken almost every traffic law, including speeding, running stop signs, running red lights, failure to yield, illegal passing on the right, illegal passing in a no-passing zone, and reckless driving without once encountering a cop in the eight-mile drive barely registered in my mind. I fixed my furious glare on the library doors and huffed like an angry bull. I held no appreciation for libraries at the time. They are increasingly obsolete relics of an age from before the internet put all that every library in the world contains and more into our homes, and even into our pockets as smartphones improved. I saw them as enclaves for the old, the poor, and the technologically illiterate.\n\nThe library was a large, sprawling, two-story affair with blocky construction and lots of windows on such a large lot of land that the utter lack of a useful public space like a playground, public pool, athletic fields, or all three since it had the space was utterly appalling to me. Seriously, if my taxes are being used to maintain the property, the least the people spending my money could do is get the most bang for my buck.\n\nI stalked up the sidewalk, violently threw open the glass double doors, and angrily marched up to the librarian. \u201cI need to use a computer.\u201d I growled.\n\nMy demeanor hardly seemed to faze her, a plump, mousy woman in her fifties with long black hair streaked with gray, or, rather, gray hair streaked with black. She merely arched one thin eyebrow at me and said \u201cOkay. Let me see your library card.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy library card? I responded incredulously. \u201cLady, I haven\u2019t been to a library since the last time my mom took me as a kid. I\u2019m only here because my computer got hit with the nastiest, sneakiest virus I\u2019ve ever seen, and I desperately need to get online so I can handle some business and get my remote service guy to clean up mu PC before I get home.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d she said with absolutely no concern whatsoever for the massive info dump I just inflicted upon her. \u201cJust fill out this form and I\u2019ll get you a library card in just a few minutes, and then you can use the computer. Just stay off those porn sites unless you want to give our computers the same virus yours has. Also, it will get your computer privileges permanently revoked.\u201d\n\nShe slid a stack of three blank forms and a pen across the desk to me. \u201cWe\u2019re not too busy right now, so you can go ahead and fill the application out right here.\u201d\n\nShe turned away and did whatever it is that bored librarians do on her computer while I filled out the forms. \u201cDone!\u201d I declared after a couple minutes of furiously jotting down the required information. \u201cCan we please hurry?\u201d I asked as I handed her the completed forms.\n\n\u201cThis won\u2019t take long,\u201d she promised. She checked the forms, and a confused, annoyed expression clouded her features. \u201cIs this a joke?\u201d she demanded as she handed the papers back to me. \u201cThese forms are blank!\u201d\n\n\u201cBullshit!\u201d I replied, annoyed at her sick sense of humor. \u201cI just filled them out! You saw me do it!\u201d\n\nI looked down at the forms in my hands. To my utter surprise, the top form was completely blank as if I had never touched pen to paper. I frantically spread them all out on the desk so I could see them all at once.\n\nThey were all blank.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s,\u201d I stammered, \u201cum . . . surprising. I could have sworn . . . I mean, I\u2019m sure I . . . whatever. I\u2019ll do it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you need help filling them out?\u201d she asked with a tone that practically screamed \u201c*Say yes and prove you\u2019re a moron. Come on. Do it*.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo . . .\u201d I murmured. \u201cJust, give me a few minutes.\u201d\n\nHad I really made some incredibly stupid mistake in my haste? I checked my pen. The ballpoint was retracted, but I was sure I\u2019d had it out while I was filling out the forms. I was sure I\u2019d had it out while I was writing. I was sure that I saw ink flowing across the page as I worked. I was severely stressed. Was it possible that I never even had the point out and just scratched blank lines of nothing on the pages? Yes. That had to be it.\n\nI clicked the top of the pen slowly and deliberately. The point came out and stuck firmly in place with a satisfying *click*. I put the pen to paper and took a few test strokes by slowly writing down my first name. Black ink flowed out onto the page and my name appeared on the white paper in solid black lines. I continued this way all the way through to the end.\n\n\u201cOkay. Done!\u201d I declared as I drew the final letter on the final page. \u201cNow can I please get my library card so I can use the computer?\u201d\n\nThe librarian picked up the forms, looked at them, then set them down and fixed me with an angry glare. \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny young man!\u201d she scolded. \u201cNow get out of here and take whatever is recording this lame prank with you!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, confused.\n\n\u201cThis!\u201d she snapped as she forcefully thrust the papers back at me and shook them under my nose before shoving them into my hands.\n\nI looked at the newly crumpled papers, and my eyes grew wide with shock. \u201cThis can\u2019t be.\u201d I mouthed breathlessly.\n\nThe pages were blank. Every line that I had just filled out in heavy block lettering was as clean and white as newly fallen snow. There weren\u2019t even the impressions that pressing my pen into the paper should have left even if I hadn\u2019t clearly seen the black ink pour out and affix itself to the paper as I wrote.\n\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be,\u201d I repeated. \u201cIt makes no sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it makes perfect sense,\u201d the librarian retorted. \u201cYou\u2019re screwing with me, and it\u2019s not funny. Now get out!\u201d\n\nLook, I\u2019m not a crier. I didn\u2019t cry when Old Yeller died. I didn\u2019t cry at the end of Where the Red Fern Grows. I didn\u2019t even cry when my own pets died. Not ever, including as a kid. My parents are alive and well, as is my brother, and I was never close to our extended family, so I had never felt loss on that level. But just then, looking at those forms, I broke down.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d The librarian went from angry to concerned the moment I shed my first tear.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d I blubbered. \u201cAll I want to do is check the internet, and I can\u2019t even fill these forms out. What\u2019s wrong with me? What\u2019s happening to me?\u201d\n\nThe librarian looked like she genuinely felt my pain. Women are amazing that way, able to feel other\u2019s emotions almost as if they were their own. It\u2019s called empathy, and they have it in buckets.\n\n\u201cTell you what,\u201d she said tenderly. \u201dI\u2019ll log you in with my credentials. Do you promise not to access any porn, drug, or anything that\u2019s against our use policy?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I nodded, rubbing my eyes dry with the back of my hand. \u201cI really do need to look a few things up. I promise it\u2019s all safe for work.\u201d\n\nShe led me to the computer lab and logged me in as a guest under her credentials. I thanked her profusely, sat down, and got to work.\n\nI checked my website.\n\nGone.\n\nI checked my social media.\n\nGone.\n\nI checked my email addresses and commerce accounts.\n\nAll gone.\n\nThen I looked myself up using every combination of data points that I could think of. I was famous. I was in the news. I was practically a household name.\n\nNothing.\n\nDefeated, I logged out of the computer and pushed my chair away from the little cubicle. I was emotionally exhausted without the energy to be even a little mad anymore. My head hung low. I waved dejectedly at the librarian on my way out and thanked her again on my way out.\n\nShe gave a confused look and asked \u201cThanks? For what?\u201d\n\nI shook my head, taking a moment to appreciate her humility that made he see the great favor she did for me as nothing. Then I turned around and dejectedly walked out the door and to my car. There was a parking ticket on my windshield. I didn\u2019t care. I left it where it was as I unlocked the doors, got in, and fired up the engine.\n\nI slumped in my seat, leaned my head back, and sighed heavily. Not knowing what was happening or why. All I knew was that my life as I knew was almost certainly over, taken from me as surely as if I had never existed, and I had no idea how I was going to get it back.\n\nHeading home, I was just as dangerous behind the wheel as I had been going to the library, but in a different way. Where once I had been angry and aggressive, now I was distracted and depressed. So, of course, I ran a stop sign.\n\nI was barely through the intersection when the cop car on the cross street pulled out behind me and lit up like a child\u2019s toy. What else could I do? I was fairly caught, so I pulled over.\n\n\u201cLicense and registration,\u201d The cop said in a firm, but bored tone of voice.\n\n\u201cOkay officer,\u201d I replied humbly. I reached into the glove box and pulled out the envelope that held my insurance and car registration and handed it to the office before taking out my wallet.\n\n\u201cWhat the,\u201d I gasped when I saw the empty space where my driver\u2019s license always resided. I showed the policeman my deficient wallet and pointed at the empty window slot. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t seem to have my license right now. I honestly don\u2019t know where it could be.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait here,\u201d the officer firmly ordered before returning to his squad car.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity, the officer returned, and this time I noticed that he had his hand on the hilt of his gun, and the holster was unbuckled.\n\n\u201cGet out of the car!\u201d he barked.\n\nI was confused. \u201cExcuse me? What?\u201d I blurted.\n\n\u201cGet out of the car now!\u201d he repeated.\n\nTruly clueless about the situation, I did as ordered, then asked \u2018Okay. Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow turn and place your hands on the hood of the vehicle!\u201d he interrupted.\n\nAgain, I did as I was told. Nobody can ever say that my parents didn\u2019t teach me to respect officers of the law, or the fact that resisting them is a great way to get beaten or shot.\n\nThe officer frisked me, found nothing, then handcuffed me. \u201cThe envelope you handed me was empty. I ran your plates and they aren\u2019t on file, which makes them ghost plates. This vehicle also matches the description of one stolen from the dealership eighteen months ago, and I\u2019m betting that the VIN on this car is a match for the stolen one.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere must be some mistake! I protested. \u201cI bought this car with cash, well, a check so that there would be a paper trail to prove the purchase, but I paid for it!\u201d\n\n\u201cSave it for the judge,\u201d he mocked. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that one before.\u201d\n\nI was roughly shoved into the back seat of the squad car. I watched and listened as the officer relayed the vehicle identification number to the precinct and waited entirely too long for the results.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a match,\u201d came the reply. The voice was female, but in no way sexy. It sounded like she\u2019d been smoking razor blades without a filter for the last thirty years.\n\nWhat came next was every cop show clich\u00e9 that ever existed. I was arrested, read my rights, booked, fingerprinted, mug shot, charged, and tossed into a communal jail cell with a bunch of petty criminals, addicts, and at least one homeless man in desperate need of a very long, very hot shower. The worst part was the body cavity search. If I had to get a gloved finger up my rear, the least they could have done was have a good looking woman do it rather than the ham-fisted brute of a man.\n\nI was left waiting in there forever. Nobody fetched me for interrogation. No lawyer came to represent me. It was as if the police simply forgot I existed.\n\nI\u2019d never been to jail before. Hell, I\u2019d never even seen the inside of a police station before. My entire image of jail was formed by television and movies. I fully expected to be surrounded by dozens of nefarious criminals who all though that I had a purty mouth. Not true. The real dangerous ones were segregated from the ordinary criminals, and I was with a pretty chill group. Sure, some of them looked rough, and there was the homeless man who smelled like he hadn\u2019t had a shower in a decade, but most were just ordinary people you wouldn\u2019t look twice at if you saw them on the street, who may or may not have done something illegal and were just waiting for bail. And more than a few of them were actually pretty cool.\n\nThe hours passed. People came and went. Then lunchtime arrived. \u201cChow time jailbirds!\u201d a young male officer with brown hair and impeccable grooming called out as he rolled a cart filled with bagged lunches into the hallway. The bags were numbered by cell, and there were exactly as may meals as there were inmates in that cell. All was well until he got to my cell.\n\nNever having been locked up before, and more preoccupied with the mystery of my car falsely coming up as stolen on top of my online existence vanishing without a trace, I found myself at the back of the line. When it was my turn to get my food, the officer gave me a puzzled look. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he apologized. \u201cIt looks like we miscounted the meals. I\u2019ll fetch you a meal as soon as I\u2019m done passing the rest of these out.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I sighed in frustration. \u201cWhat\u2019s one more inconvenience in a disaster of a day like this anyway?\u201d\n\nI sat down on the bench nearest the cell door and waited as everyone else in the cell block got their food.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be right back!\u201d the officer promised as he wheeled the empty cart past my cell.\n\nI gave him an insincere smile and a halfhearted wave as he exited the cell block and waited for him to come back with my lunch.\n\nAnd waited.\n\nAnd waited.\n\nAnd waited.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I grumbled after an hour had passed. \u201cThat damn cop lied to me!\u201d My stomach gurgled loudly as if to punctuate my irritated claim.\n\nThe homeless man approached me on unsteady feet. Holding out his brown bag he said \u201cThake this. I didn\u2019t finish mine.\u201d\n\nI was genuinely shocked by the offer. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I began to protest.\n\nHe cut me off. \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to be ignored, forgotten, and hungry. Please. Take it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said as I gratefully took the food, no longer caring about the stench that enveloped him like a billowing cloak.\n\nSay what you will about the homeless. Dismiss them as drunks, druggies, and lunatics if you want to, but they have enormous empathy for the suffering of others. There\u2019s something about life being genuinely hard, even out of control, that instills this in them. Most of them will give you the shirt off their back while someone who\u2019s fully self-absorbed in their comparatively minor problems as they fail to appreciate their comfy little world will walk right on by without so much as looking at you. That\u2019s why I go out my way to be good to the homeless, as opposed to the normies who I, well, genuinely don\u2019t care for anymore.\n\nWe spoke while I ate, and long after until dinnertime. I told him my story, and he seemed to believe me with some obvious effort. He told me his story too. I\u2019ll call him Tom here. That\u2019s not his real name, but if I did violate his privacy, he wouldn\u2019t remember me anyway, so Tom it is.\n\nHe was an Iraq war veteran. Before that he was happy. He was physically and mentally strong. He had a master\u2019s degree in accounting and joined the army as an infantry officer to get his student loans repaid. He discovered that he loved the military and resolved to stay in beyond his initial six-year commitment. He married a beautiful woman. He made captain in just three years.\n\nThen the war started. You all know how it went at first. The nation was reeling and out for blood, justifiably so, but in our zealous desire for revenge we made mistakes. It would be easy to blame the politicians for everything, but the truth is that they only did what the voters demanded of them, and many who resisted paid for it with their careers.\n\nThat\u2019s the bargain you make to be in politics after all.\n\nTom\u2019s unit was deployed to Afghanistan where all went reasonably well all things considered at the time. Then they were redeployed to Iraq instead of coming home when their tour was over. The fighting was easy at first, then became interminable and sneaky as the local zealots, with foreign backing and support, decided to start an insurgency that kept us bogged in that quagmire for far too long.\n\nInsurgents caused many casualties in his unit, and as his deployment got extended many times, the stress, pain, and losses of a prolonged war got to him.\n\nThe final straw was when he finally returned home, a major\u2019s leaf freshly pinned on his collar, only to discover that his wife that he hadn\u2019t seen for over two years was pregnant with a six-month old baby in her arms. Obviously, neither child was his, and she had divorce papers waiting for him to sign on the kitchen table.\n\nBroken, he signed them without reading them, went to the drug store, bought a toxic mix of over the counter drugs, and downed them all right in front of the cashier.\n\nNaturally, she called 911. He got medical intervention, stomach pumped and all. Then he spent a month involuntarily committed to a mental hospital. Once he was released, he reported to his commander only to find that he was being discharged for mental health with a disability rating for severe PTSD.\n\nThat was the end of his life as he knew it. He began to disregard himself as he spent his entire VA check on booze every month. He ended up homeless, broken, and abandoned with nothing but a few taxpayer dollars every month and a bottle of liquor to keep him company.\n\nHis story still breaks my heart. What\u2019s left of it anyway.\n\nTom, if you\u2019re reading this and recognize your story, I genuinely hope that you got the help you need and have been able to rebuild your life. You deserve happiness.\n\nRebuilding my own life has proved to be impossible.\n\nDinner came, and the same officer who forgot to bring my lunch was serving dinner.\n\n\u201cYou jerk!\u201d I yelled when I saw him. \u201cYou promised you\u2019d bring me lunch then left me to starve!\u201d\n\nThe office scowled at me. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d he demanded.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t play stupid with me!\u201d I shrieked. \u201cThis is police brutality! Or prisoner neglect, or whatever that crime is called!\u201d\n\nThe officer spoke into his radio. \u201cWe have a disruptive prisoner in cell 3,\u201d he said in an official tone. Looking right at me he stated, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this guy before.\u201d\n\nThat set off my cell mates. They all started talking over each other as they verified my side of the story. They accused him of tormenting prisoners for fun. One called him a racist even thought the cop\u2019s skin color is as white as mine.\n\nI guess telling you my race is general enough. It\u2019s not like anyone can pick me out of lineup with that info after all. Still, I\u2019m mildly surprised that I\u2019m allowed to tell you even that much about me.\n\nSeveral other cops showed up brandishing batons and tasers. They barked orders at us, and everyone backed away from the bars before one keyed the door and opened it. Two large officers manhandled and cuffed me before dragging me out of the cell. The one with the keys closed to door and locked it behind us.\n\n\u201cWho is this guy anyway?\u201d the cop with the meal cart asked as I was being hauled away.\n\n\u201cNo idea,\u201d replied one of my escorts, a fit, compact woman with bleached blonde hair. Nobody remembers bringing him in. Booking is looking him up now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want a lawyer!\u201d I demanded. \u201cThis is bullshit! Give me a lawyer!\u201d\n\nMy police escort ignored my protests as they dragged me to an interrogation room and unceremoniously dumped me into the chair.\n\nThe lady cop\u2019s radio crackled. \u201cWe can\u2019t find a record on this guy. His file must have been misplaced. No idea why he\u2019s not in the computer either.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wait here while we find your file,\u201d the lady cop ordered.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go forgetting about me,\u201d I replied sarcastically. \u201cAnd where\u2019s my damn dinner?\n\n\u201cYou get fed when we know who you are and why you\u2019re here,\u201d she snapped back.\n\nI laughed. \u201cMy name is \u2013\u201c I told her my name. I can speak it freely even if it won\u2019t take to print no matter how many times I type it out. \u201cAnd I\u2019m here because one of you idiot cops accused me of stealing my own car that I paid for in full. \u201cI glared at them both. \u201cNow can I go home, or are we going to play the bureaucracy game?\u201d\n\nOne of the male cops glared back at me. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find your file and ID you before we do anything. We never take a perp at his word. We\u2019re not stupid.\u201d\n\nThey both left the room and closed it over my loud stream of vile invectives. I\u2019d never had a problem with the cops before. They do perform a vital service even if they do it imperfectly, but everything about that situation was bullshit. I was rightfully pissed, and I felt justified showing it.\n\nI kept yelling at the closed door for awhile before giving up. I looked around the room. It was bare and sterile with one table and two chairs placed on either side of it. There was a one-way mirror in the wall, a door, and a camera mounted in the corner of the ceiling. The red recording light was not on. I assume that\u2019s because they only use it during active interrogations.\n\nI settled in and waited for the cops to return with my file and my dinner.\n\nAnd waited.\n\nAnd waited.\n\nAnd waited for hours upon hours.\n\nBeing all alone with nothing but your own thoughts can be a good thing. Hell, it can be downright therapeutic, giving you a chance to work through your troubles or clear your mind so you can focus on a creative task or puzzle. It\u2019s not a good thing when you\u2019re enraged and obsessed. In that case you ruminate, marinating in a vicious circle of negativity that leaves you stewing over your situation until you can\u2019t take it anymore and you explode.\n\nI think you know which one of these cases describes mine.\n\n\u201cThis is bullshit!\u201d I screamed at the top of my lungs, violently rising to my feet, banging my knees against the table in the process. I wheeled around and kicked the chair away from me with all my rage. It flew across the small room and banged against the wall. The pain in my shin assured me that my outburst would leave me with a nasty bruise to remember it by.\n\nI pounded on the door with both of my cuffed fists. \u201cLet me out of here you bastards!\u201d I screamed. \u201cI\u2019ve been stuck in here all night! I\u2019m hungry! I\u2019m thirsty! And I need to pee dammit!\u201d\n\nThere was no response, but I didn\u2019t give up. I kept pounding on the door and screaming. It felt like I was at it forever. My fists were bruised. My voice went hoarse.\n\nFinally, someone opened the door. It was the lady officer who had been part of my escort to this damnable pit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about damn time!\u201d I spat. \u201cHow could you stick me in here and just abandon me like that?\u201d\n\nNext thing I knew, I felt a massive jolt of electricity surge into my body, and I went to the floor in a twitching heap.\n\nThe lady cop keyed her radio on. \u201cThis is officer Valdez,\u201d She said in an official tone. \u201cSomeone\u2019s in interrogation room two. I had to subdue him. This room is supposed to be empty. Do we have an ID on someone being put in here?\u201d\n\n\u201cNegative,\u201d Came the reply. \u201cThat room hasn\u2019t been used since the double homicide last week.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen who is the prisoner in it right now?\u201d she asked her radio.\n\n\u201cYou bitch!\u201d I managed to spit out. \u201cYou tossed my ass in here yourself!\u201d\n\nShe looked at me with pure scorn. \u201cNo,\u201d she replied coldly. \u201cI\u2019d remember you if I had.\u201d"},"67":{"title":"I wish I never played OG fortnight.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1h9vfiw\/i_wish_i_never_played_og_fortnight\/","flair":"Story","author":"DiamondRTM","selftext":"About a day ago I discovered Fortnite was bringing back OG fortnite from YouTube video I saw. At first I thought they were lying, then I looked for myself. it was exactly like OG fortnite Jump out of plane, look for weapons and materials, and try to stay alive until the end. Even though I wasn\u2019t having a lot of fun because the players, just clicked and boom I was addicted. Each hour I spent more and more time playing. When I wasn\u2019t playing I was on Reddit reading about Fortnite or on Twitch and YouTube watching others play OG Fortnite.\n\nI thought of dropped out of college and quit my part time job to give myself 100% to the addicting game which is OG Fortnite. The real world ceased to exist, in my mind at least.\n\nOne game of OG fortnite traumatized my life forever. when I spawned in I checked the map I saw that the maps were renamed to\u2026. instead of Risky Reels it was called Rapist Thrills. Dusty Divot was named Bloody Wound. Pleasant Park was renamed Agony Avenue and Greasy Grove was renamed Disembowel Drive. I won\u2019t list the other places but you get the idea. The water in the game was blood. the skins were very disturbing one looked like a zombie with a ripped bloody smock on. The pickaxe was a huge rusty bloody scalpel with chunks of gore dripping off it and his back bling was an aborted fetus. My one of was EMOTES was CORRUPTED one of them was my character masturbating until climax complete with ejaculation. I couldn\u2019t believe it and finally decided to leave the game but I could not leave\u2026\n\nThe match was brutal my gun was covered in blood and rust. when shot a player they would bleed out with Hyper realistic blood and eyes They also screamed in pain. Text came up to my screen saying \u201cif you died in game you died in real life!!!\u201c in demonic voice I was very very scared of dying because video game I started to get shot from all sides! I quickly hid Suddenly I heard a player screaming, he started smashing the hiding spot I was in he had a bloody pickaxe, he had the avatar of jonesy with hyper realistic eyes, blood, skins of players and gore which it was covered in.\n\nI shot him in the head he died, I ran away from scene I went into the deep woods then I saw five people wearing masks and doing an orgy I shot and killed them this was certainly nothing like I have seen before.\n\nslinging blood all over the screen of dead players? My assumption was for this scary game of fortnite that an hacker hack the game. also the time was 3am.\n\nThere was one player left he looked like mario but evil. He attack me with rage I shot him and he died then a nude guy popped up on screen .\n\nI called the cops they said \u201cthey will look into this\u201d\n\nIm very tramated I see people doing orgies outside my window ."},"68":{"title":"Story Time Woth Ol' Mabel","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1h1wwgt\/story_time_woth_ol_mabel\/","flair":"Story","author":"ZealousidealYam4891","selftext":"                          I.\n\nOh, hush now, child, just take a bite and gain your strength. A growing boy needs to eat. While you eat, I'll tell you a story. A stormy night like this reminds me of my first born, rest his soul. His name was Anton , and he was brought into the world on a night just like this. Storms brewing, thunder rattling the windows and the sky lit up with streaks of lightning. What a glorious scene to bring life into our home. I was so proud to be his mama, can't say the same about his pa. Don't worry, I'll explain that later. Eat up now. Ronald was a strong and handsome man. The best crop of our family. See back in my day, to keep the bloodline strong, we were courted by our cousins. And he was my chosen beau. My, my, my was he a dreamboat. Muscular arms, tall and full of wonder. His mama, my aunt Vera, happily took the four cows and Billy goat for the dowry. The two of us were married in the old Abbadon church up on the hill near Necropolis Creek. It was a small ceremony but oh, was it beautiful. I sure shed a tear or two when he put that ring on my finger. The first few years were a dream, but then Ronald started up his still. That corn liquor he made sure brought the devil out of him. He would beat me something fierce if I didn't have dinner ready the moment he came home from the mines. Ain't nothin worse than taking a coal dust covered fist to the face. That black powder leaves a harsh sting in your eye, and the swelling is horrendous, to say the least.\n\nWhat's that? Oh, you don't like the soup? Well, that's quite alright, I'll sit it over here for now. Hm, where was I? Ah, that's right. After I learned the proper way to avoid Ronald's fits of rage, I did my best to keep him in good spirits. Freshly baked cookies filled with barbiturates did the trick. But it tended to put him in a certain mood. The downside of his giant size was his lustful manner and what he was equipped with. I'll spare you the details, but let's just say he would leave me sore and praying for the nights to end quickly. It made matters worse when I would ask him to stop. Didn't take long to learn to bear the burden and just let the man get his fill. It was a painful process, but I'd rather have dealt with that than that thick leather strap being brought against my back and cheek. Especially when he swung it with the brass buckle at the end of it. Never a fun experience, trust me, deary.\n\nAs luck would have it, we were eventually blessed with a visit from the stork. Yes, sir, I was pregnant. And let me tell ya, the weight and pains were absolute hell. It made cooking and cleaning difficult with a giant belly in my way. Ronald was not at all pleased by that, which meant he would either take a strap to me or throw a few punches to my stomach. But that's just how the man was, so I had to up the dosage on the barbiturates in order to calm his fits of rage. But that also meant he would be even rougher in the carnal way. Eventually, one thing led to another, and during a session of rough passion, he caused my water to break. I was new to the realm of pregnancy, so I didn't know that blood was a bad sign. What fourteen year old lady would know such things? What's that? Oh, why yes I did get married young but that was normal back then. Ronald? I believe he was nineteen when we wed. Don't look at me like that. You kids nowadays live differently, in my day, that was normal. Shoosh now, and let me continue. Like I said, I was new to motherhood and didn't know what to expect. Although I did find it odd that I also bled out of my nose while pink foam oozed out of my eyes. It was a mess of fluids, and oh my, the birthing pains. Child, let me tell you, I would rather have been beaten with Ronald's hickory cane than go through that again.\n\nAfter the straining and pushing through my labor, our little boy was born. Ronald gasped and yelled when he caught a glimpse of the baby. I believe his exact words were, \"Shit! What the hell did you grow in your body, woman? Toss it off the cliff out yonder!\" He was not happy with the child he had a hand in making. Granted, Anton wasn't the most handsome boy, but he was such an angel. He had one of my blue eyes and one of Ronald's hazel eyes. His hair did grow in odd places due to the patches of orange scales that protruded from his scalp. But it was clear the hair color came from my side of the family. His olive skin was a sure sign of Ronald's side. But the jagged horn above his left eyebrow was a mystery to me. As was the tail with its heart shaped tip, it caught me off guard as well.\n\nI refused to listen to Ronald, no matter how much he beat me. Anton was our baby, and I would protect him no matter what. Motherhood is sure difficult. I'll tell ya. Never knew that babies drank blood along with breast milk. But Anton sure loved to bite hard enough to break the skin. Sometimes, he preferred to feed from my wrists instead of my breast. He would use a small set of rather sharp teeth to make a hole in my vein. It was a little uncomfortable but what can you do? Huh? Sorry honey, you need to speak up. I don't hear so well anymore after Anton chewed this ear off. Oh no. I never had relations with anyone else prior. Anton was definitely Ronald's child. What's that? Oh no, no, no. Why would I ever beat my child? It was just an ear. Besides, Anton didn't know what he was doing. And he seemed rather happy after he ingested it. He had been struck with a terrible tummy ache that week, and after he swallowed my ear, he was cured. It was so strange, but I was relieved that my boy felt better afterward. How could I punish him for that?\n\nAnyway, as the years went on, Ronald got worse with his drinking. This meant he got meaner. He tried many times to take Anton away and throw him off the cliff near our home or leave him outside in the cold during the winter following his birth. One time, he got so angry that he threw the boy through our window. I tried to warn him about Anton's dewclaws, but he refused to listen. And he would complain about the boy's glowing eyes. To be fair, it did give me a start the first time I saw Anton's eyes glowing in the dark. But that was no reason for him to be thrown out like a piece of trash, especially out a glass window. Luckily, our baby boy was a tough little cookie. He barely bled and received no broken bones. \n\nOn his fourth birthday, we had both had our fill with Ronald's bad behavior. I had spent all day making a nice cake full of Anton's  favorite flavors. Buttercream, chocolate, blood, and stag beetles. I spent that day slaving over the stove to fry up the possums who had been rummaging through our trash. They're a bit gamey in taste, but Anton loved to eat them. I added some mashed potatoes and deep-fried scorpions drizzled in honey, and the dinner was complete. I even clipped off my pinky toe to give the birthday boy an extra treat for his special day. After all, he did have a fondness for the taste of my flesh. I'd do anything for that boy.\n\nRonald barged in shortly after Anton had blown out his candles. The man reeked of corn liquor and cigars. He slapped my poor baby across the face so hard that a tooth flew out of his mouth, I heard it bounce onto the floor. He shed those green colored tears and ran to his room. I threw off my apron and ran after him, but Ronald stopped me. He gripped my arm hard and spun me around. Fire burned in his eyes when he scolded me. \"You worthless bitch! Why are you celebrating that creature? He needs to die!\" He slapped me in the face then stormed towards Anton. I heard the door fly open, and the sound of his hand pummeling against my child sent a jolt in my spine. Anton wailed in pain while Ronald screamed at him. Calling him a beast, monster, and bastard. \n\nI hit my breaking point then and gripped the knife I was going to use to cut the cake. The wooden handle creaked when I squoze it. I slowly started walking towards the sounds, my heart thumped so hard that I could feel it in my temples. My ears buzzed, and my legs felt stiff. I wasn't sure what my true intentions were but I knew I had to stop Ronald. Right as I got to the doorway, the commotion ceased and was replaced by a wet noise followed by a long moaning gasp of air. I walked in to see Anton pulling his horn out of a hole it had created in Ronald's stomach. The red liquid spurt, and some landed on my dress. The fluid slowly dripped off of the horn, and a pool surrounded Ronald. He glared at me and rasped. \"Kill that damn thing, Mabel. Now!\" His hand squoze my ankle. I kicked him off and dropped to my knees. A spark lit up within me, and i watched my arms raise and bring that blade deep into the chest of the man I once loved. \n\nI can't tell you how many times I drove it in or how long I spent cleaning the mess we had made. Anton helped move the body into our little shed. Over the course of a month, my growing boy had completely devoured the corpse of his late father until there was nothing left but bones. Such a helpful child. I sold Ronalds still and his tractor in order to make ends meet. Eventually, I opened up my own bakery down on Dartmoth Avenue. Anton helped me for a while but avoided every customer that came in to buy my baked goods. He was such a shy boy. \nOh, here. Why don't you have a cookie sweetey. They're fresh and made from real strawberries. They were one of my best sellers at the bakery. \n\nHelp yourself while I continue. Now, when Anton was fifteen, he became interested in girls. He had his eye on a few and I did my best to educate him. At least from a woman's perspective. He went a courtin' but sadly all the girls ran away from him. He was reaching seven feet tall and I guess his horn, tail and dew claws seemed off putting. But if they had looked past those things, they would see what a sweet boy he was. He soon went sneaking out periodically. I knew it was happening, but I didn't yell at him for it. I thought the freedom would break him out of his shell. Little did I know what he was doing during those nightly adventures. I soon found out when I discovered the scalps of a few girls along with their torn dresses. The fabric was tattered and stained red. The scalps look to have been crudely ripped off. Clearly, things didn't work out with them, and Anton. Before I could hide these things or talk to my son, there was an orange glow outside and a loud banging at the door. I answered it to see the entire town in my yard. All equipped with torches and a few had rope and knives. They demanded Anton to come out. They were gonna lynch my poor baby! I couldn't let that happen so I tried to slam the door. Unfortunately I wasn't strong enough and they busted in. Two men hit me then held me down while a few others ran into Anton's to discover the scalps and dresses. They destroyed the house, trying to find him. Eventually, they caught him while he attempted to run out of the back door.\n\nI was dragged to witness the heartbreaking event. I was to be there to watch my boy hang. The men tied his hands behind his back and pushed him to the center of town. They strung up a rope and tied the noose while a group of five beat and stomped on my poor Anton. He shrieked with agony as the blood spewed from his mouth. One man gouged his beautiful blue eye out. In a twist of events, he broke his restraints and was able to hold his own for a while. He ripped the throats of two, then snapped the neck of another. I cheered for my boy as he fought for his life. But he was soon overpowered. The mayor stuck a knife in his back, then they put that rope around his neck. They pulled him off the ground and forced me to watch him flail and kick until the life fluttered from his one remaining eye. They left him hanging for three days before setting his body on fire. I was punished for trying to save him. The bastards burned my bakery and locked me in the courthouse jail for eight days. Seeing that they saw me as a sad old woman, I wasn't banished or anything like that. But for a while, no one spoke to me. \n\nI still miss my son dearly and these stormy nights remind me of him. And your bright blue eyes remind me of him too. Oh, you wanna know what makes those cookies so crunchy? Why those are the bits of stag beetle wings. Anton loved those! Ugh! How rude. Why would you spit those out? Such disrespect. I'm gonna have to leave you here to sit and think of what you've done. Distasteful display, I swear.\n\n                          II.\n\nHave you thought about your actions, young man? No? Just gonna sit there in silence? Fine then. You know, you should be grateful for every meal you receive. Some day things like that won't be around. It's a good thing you weren't here for the famine of '82. My, what a dreadful time to be in Azazel Pines. There was a terrible drought followed by a monstrous plague of black mold, which decimated everyone's fields. Not a single ear of corn or grain of wheat could be eaten. What crops didn't die from lack of rain were destroyed by the black pulsing veins of that nasty disease. I remember watching old Cotton Athens trying to eat an infected batch of potatoes. They were covered in that mold, and two days after he ate them, he ran outside screaming. His eyes were oozing pus, and his stomach was bloated. As I watched him fall to his knees, his stomach burst open. Blood and intestines splattered on the yellow grass that had been dead for months.  Large insects popped out and dug into the dirt. Poor Cotton rolled in pure terror and agony for a few minutes before bleeding to death. There were a few other residents who tried eating the plagued crops. Each one died in about the same manner. The whole damn thing caused the population here to dwindle drastically.\n\nThis led to everyone around here turning to hunting. Now most folks around these parts did hunt on occasion, but now it was becoming a necessity. However, the problem was that you had to look out for the animals with black mushrooms growing from their ears and nose. Or pay attention to the green sludge that dripped from their eyes or mouth. Those  ones were rabbid and infected with that black mold. If you ate them, you'd go insane. It was a time of discovery because no one in the beginning knew the effects of eating those poor critters. I heard a man down the road lost his mind and tried eating his wife. I don't know how true it is, but I didn't want to take any chances. So I made sure to steer clear of any odd looking animals just to be safe.\n\nWith the fear of the mold and crazed animals, resources became limited, and the stores barely had any reserves. Now, being alone with barely any money, I couldn't really get any provisions from the markets in town. But I was smart and had a basement full of preservatives and pickled vegetables. Due to the famine and such, I made sure to eat them sparingly. To save on the food that was stored in jars, I did take to looking for a way to trap healthy animals for the protein. Not being  much of a trapper myself, this was a bit of a struggle. However it was easier than expected to catch a few squirrels and raccoons when they came around. One of these critters was already infected so I had to toss it out. That was a mistake, though, because the neighbor's dog ended up eating it. I guess I should have either burned or buried it. I would soon pay for that mistake.\n\nThat was a terrifying night, nearly had a heart attack. The damn thing busted through my window and tried to eat me. The crazed mut ripped right into my leg. Take a look. I still have a nasty scar from it. Hideous sight, ain't it? When it latched onto my leg, I panicked and hit it upside the head. That briefly stunned the animal long enough for me to run in the main room and grab Ronald's old rifle. He only showed me how to shoot it once, so I was nervous about firing it. The dog crept in on shaky legs. A long trail of green mucus fell from those nasty teeth. There were polyps and other disgusting tumors that littered its body. Some pulsed and spewed gut wrenching fluids that smelled like death. I swear I could hear its heartbeat as it got closer. The thing lunged at me and I closed my eyes then pulled the trigger. The sound made my ears ring, but I got lucky and hit it. Upon opening my eyes I saw the blood and brains of the animal all over my walls. The head completely exploded. Weird writhing black insects squirmed out of the crude opening of what was once its skull. They fell from the opening and wriggled to the spaces in between the floor planks and fell through the cracks. Smoke rose from the pungent blood that almost looked like tar. The dog's legs twitched, and it sent me in a panic. I gripped the gun and shot it one more time. After that, I buried the body out back and spent hours cleaning the mess.\n\nI learned real quick how to use that gun afterwards, making sure to have it on me at all times. Crazed animals with those growths continued trying to attack me which ended up leaving a literal pile of dead critters. Eventually I had to burn them in a large fire pit out back. It got worse when the neighbors started trying to come after me. The worst was Sheila Evans. Her haggard shape and jerky steps scared the dickens out of me when I was sitting on my porch. She screamed at me, but it sounded like a dying wolf or something. Her eyes were gone and all that was left was vacant holes. And these strange ropes of blue material were there. They swayed back and forth like a group of earthworms. Her teeth were gone, replaced by what I can only be described as insect pincers. You know, like what beetles have in the front of their heads. The sides of her mouth were cracked, flesh split all the way up to her ears. When she screamed, it opened up wide to show her spine behind that disgusting purple tongue littered with yellow boils. The worst part was when she bent over and started galloping towards me on all fours. Large talons had grown over her fingers. A mass of waving tentacles burst from her back. They flailed in the air, sending a sound that resembled  a distorted windchime.\n\nHer speed was inhuman, and I surprised even myself when pulling the trigger to landed a shot right in her skull. It only slowed the deformed woman down. So I hastily unloaded a few more shots until she fell limp. As I approached, Sheila was breathing heavily and leaking a fluid that looked like oil. She stunk of rot, and then her head snapped towards me. A mucus of red escaped that horrifying mouth and hit my face. Some of the remnants landed right on my tongue. The taste sent me into a world of disgust accompanied by a fit of blind rage. Without thinking, I took the butt of the gun and bashed her head in until I heard a loud crack. Once the body ceased moving, I doused it in gasoline and let it burn to ash.\n\nWhat's that? Oh heavens no. We were never friends so I didn't feel too bad. But then again, I doubt Sheila ever wanted to become something so macabre. Don't you worry child, she's in a much better place. I'm glad you decided to finally chime in. Are you hungry? No? That's alright. I'll make you something when you're ready. Now the famine continued like this for almost an entire year. During that time I had to end countless animals and about eight townsfolk. All of them resembled what poor old Sheila had turned into. And towards the end, I started getting strange cravings. I had found a pack of dead possums near my trash can, and I don't know what came over me, but I ate them. It was like some animalistic hunger came over me, and I couldn't hold back. Something about the smell of expired meat and their soiled fur, it just sent a terrible hunger in my stomach. I'll tell ya, raw meat takes a lot of effort to chew. It's even worse when you're trying to tear it from the bone with your teeth. Tends to be a little easier when the meat has been rotting for a week or two. And boy, do the clumps of hair hurt when you try to pass them on the toilet. Oh dear, I apologize. Talking like that isn't very lady-like. So sorry, deary. Huh? Oh no. I never went and tried eating a neighbor. I'm no cannibal. Just the occasional rotten rodent. The deader, the better, was my motto back then. But I tried to eat the corpses before maggots began squirming around the spoiled meat. Those damn creepy crawlies taste way too much like almonds, and I absolutely despise almonds. So usually, I would brush them off before eating the pieces of meat with that green shimmer and sickly sweet scent. \n\nAfter the famine finally ended, it seemed like I saw less and less of those random dead critters. This meant I had to teach myself how to eat normal cooked food again. It took some time, but eventually, I trained my body back to normalcy for the most part. But I'll tell you a secret, sometimes I'll go out and shoot me a squirrel or raccoon and leave their body out for a while. Let them bake in the son until they're good and bloated, then have myself a nice little snack. It's like a delicacy. After the gases in the body make it expand, that's when the savory flavors really bubble to the surface. Maybe if you're good, I'll bring you a slice of some spoiled raccoon liver. I believe I have a few scraps left from the last time I did that. No? Well, suit yourself. So are you ready for your lunch yet, deary? You should eat something. Don't you starve yourself now. Okay, then I'll check back on you later. You just relax and try to get some rest. You look quite tired.\n\n                      III.\n\nHow are we this morning deary? Oh that's too bad. You must have not gotten much sleep. Calm down, calm down. I'll get you some water. There ya go. Oh! Why would you do that? Such a rude boy. I didn't want to have to do that but you forced my hand. That slap is mild compared to what I did to the last person who spit in my face. Oh don't you get that tone with me. You're gonna sit there and listen. There, since you want to be such a problem, you're gonna sit there with that sock in your mouth. Keep it up and I'll get a switch. Hmph.\n\nThis story will be a lesson of what happens when you disrespect a lady. Hopefully you learn somethin' from it. Hush. Ain't no sense in trying to talk. If you stay calm and quiet, then maybe I'll take the sock out and let you speak. But you'll have to earn that privilege. Now then, I'll start the tale. In my later years after the loss of Ronald and my sweet angel Anton, I longed for companionship. My books were open as was my heart. So I went searching for love once again. The first attempt was not the greatest. He was nice enough, but he was too handsy. I'm a modest woman and am not accustomed to necking on the first date. Well this fellow was. I believe his name was Hank. No. Harry? Oh my, this old brain of mine. Age tends to creep up on you when you least expect. Oh! Harold! Harold Devine was his name. He held the persona and image of a true gentleman when I first met him. I would learn his true nature during our third date. He took me to dinner, and we went on a drive to the peak of Pestilence Hill. We sat and viewed the blood moon in the sky. We kissed, but then this man tried to put his hands all over me. I wouldn't stand for that and demanded he stop. \n\nAfter the third attempt to get his hand under my blouse, I slapped him across the face. This led to a scuffle that ended with me getting a busted lip and his eye being jabbed by one of my nails. He screamed and cursed. He lunged forward, his body hovering over me as he began to squeeze my throat while calling me a cunt. Such a nasty word. So I threw my knee into his groin as I began to see stars. He jerked back, cupping his crotch. That's when I pulled the knife out of my purse, a habit I picked up from the time of the famine. I took that blade and slid it across his throat. Sumbitch deserved it in my opinion. I watched him cry while clutching his open neck. He bled out all over his fancy button up shirt. After he finally died, I put the car in neutral and pushed it towards the cliff. Huh? Alright, well you've been good so I suppose I can remove the sock and let you speak. Why yes I did. I know I'm small, but I was able to do it. It helped that where we were parked was on a downward slope. So eventually, gravity took hold, and Harold rolled down to the woods below with his snazzy car.\n\nDon't give me that look. He tried to kill me. I'd be damned if I allowed that. So I took him out first. Stop interrupting and let me finish. Disrespectful boy. You don't want the sock put back in your mouth, do you? That's what I thought. A month after the sheriff found Harold's body, I was being escorted around town by the most handsome farmer in Azazel Pines. He was a lumbering giant of a man by the name of Bartholomew. He proposed to me countless times, but I kept refusing. The time didn't feel right. I wasn't ready to be married all over again. At least not at that point in time. I did fancy him, but I was in no rush to get hitched,  especially to someone outside of the bloodline. But all the other men in the family were spoken for. This meant I had limited options. \n\nAnywho, Bartholomew treated me like a queen and never tried to hike up my skirt, so to speak. Such a gentleman. However, I later caught him swapping spit with Ol' Suzy Lumbar. The town Harlet, who had her honeypot dipped by many a men. I caught them in the act in the alley near Beelzebub's Tavern. I startled them with my approach, and Bartholomew tried to bold face lie to me. When I berated him, he spat in my face and called me a jealous winch. I saw red and as if controlled by pure rage, I attacked him. The surprise of my attack caused him to fall. I beat his face until my fists throbbed. I then took off one of my heels and pummeled him. The sharp end of the footwear stuck deep in his eye. This caused him to shriek, and behind me, Suzy screamed, then fled. I got up and tackled her. There was no way I was letting this whore get away.\n\nIn the struggle of our fight, she tried to crawl away. I believe I heard one of her nails snap off on the asphalt. She put up some resistance, but there was no chance of escape. Especially after having her nasty thin lips on my Bartholomew. I hit her continuously, and eventually, I stood up and stomped on her head until I heard a sickening crack. I tell ya, my foot was swollen for weeks after that. I may have broken something because it has never felt right since. To this day, it still hurts to walk, and that was almost twenty-five years ago.\n\nBeing that I couldn't just let the carnage be left for someone to discover and fingers being pointed at me. I ran to the butcher shop down the street and asked for help. I spun a tale of Suzy getting handsy with Bartholomew and assaulting me before turning on him. I told the sheriff that Bartholomew lost control while defending me, accidentally killing her. Well, Suzy was buried back in the cramped cemetery on Cretan Park. Bartholomew, on the other hand, was hanged for his assault and murder. Apparently, I didn't kill him after stabbing his eye with my high heel.\n\nMy heart broke watching that poor man swing from a rope. His legs twitching and that awful sound of his neck snapping. I cried myself to sleep for weeks. But then, one day, I got a bright idea. My heart fell for him, and I could make him mine due to my hesitance. But I was finally ready to settle and he was the one. So I scrounged through my grandmother's things that were kept in a large trunk up in the attic. It took some time sorting through the vials, bags and countless tomes but eventually I found that special black book of hers. I scanned the pages until I found the chapter on resurrection. In order to do the spell correctly, I had to wait for a hunter's moon, which gave me about five days. In that time I had to sacrifice my neighbors stallion to the demon Ba'al, drain the blood from a venomous snake and store it under my bed, eat a raw heart from a toad amongst other things. Those details aren't that important to the story. What? Oh, yes this is all true. Crazy? Of course not. I am many things but a liar is not one of them, deary.\n\nThe most important part of this ritual was making sure to have these things done in time of the celestial event and dig up Bartholomew in order to bring him home. I was able to get what I needed just one day before the hunter's moon. Let me tell ya, digging out the earth of a fresh grave is not as easy as it sounds. Neither is trying to remove the body, either. Good thing I had a rope in the bed of Ronald's old pick up. I was able to tie up the body, attach it to the bumper and pull him out of that hole. I won't get into the full details, but after some time and effort, I was able to bring my love home.\n\nI followed the directions and spoke the incantations properly within the allotted time. I went to bed with a corpse on my living room floor. I woke up the next morning to find Bartholomew alive and chomping down on a dead deer he had brought inside. The mess took some time to clean, and the revived man did try to attack me. But thanks to my grandmother's book, I was able to create a dust to make him compliant. A little handful blown in the brutes face, and he became open to suggestions. At least enough to lure him to the basement. The chains held well and kept him in place. We had a glorious relationship while it lasted. Although he couldn't talk beyond the grunts and screams, he was still the man I fell in love with. He just smelled a little different and a tad bit more aggressive. I didn't let that ruin the time we had together. We made love every night right over there where that bed is in the corner. Oh don't give me that look, it's completely natural. Don't act so disgusted. Anyway, I eventually became pregnant, but sadly, the child inside of me didn't make it. None of them did. I don't know if you saw the crosses in the front yard or not. Those are all of the children Bartholomew and I lost during our time together. After the fifth attempt, we gave up on trying to start a family.\n\nI didn't read the fine print on the resurrection page and soon learned that even though revived spiritually, Bartholomew's body was still dead. This meant he continued to decay over time. He was losing limbs and becoming more and more ravenous in his attempts to get free and bite me. Sadly, I had to put him down after he escaped his restraints and tried to kill me. Two shots to the head and my sweet farmer could finally rest in peace. After burning his body, I accepted that love was lost to me. Since then, I have lived a solitary life. Tending to my garden, occasionally cooking the animals I catch in the traps. Just keeping to myself. But then you came along. \n\nAnd what a blessing if I do say so myself. You are a spitting image of my late Ronald and yet your eyes resemble Bartholomew's. It's as if the universe sent me another chance at happiness. Combining the men who stole my heart when I was young. The moment you came to my door, I knew love was not lost. Oh, stop it. There's no need to get all riled up, deary. Just hold still. The more you struggle, the worse it's gonna be. What? How dare you! Don't ever call me such a name! Stop fighting. Acting like this will not get you out of those chains. And I damn sure won't let you out of this basement while acting in such a crude manner. Just relax my love. Hold still and give Mabel a kiss. Ow! Son of a bitch! What kind of animal bites a lady's lip? Bastard! Ugh. Well you didn't want to listen and now look at you. Sitting there, bleeding out like a stuck pig. All you had to do was behave and let me love you. But no, you had to act out in such a horrible way, forcing my hand to jab this knife in your chest. Ugh. What a waste. No worry. I've got plans for you young man. I'll be back after you bleed out with my grandmother's book. This time I'll make sure to read the fine print this time. Maybe find a better resurrection spell. Don't want you falling apart on me like Bartholomew. \n\n\n"},"69":{"title":"Barstool Bargain","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1h1hwgj\/barstool_bargain\/","flair":"Story","author":"Verlac_1","selftext":"The rain was relentless, hammering down on the pavement like a symphony of despair. I sat slumped in the corner of O\u2019Malley\u2019s, a dingy little bar that smelled of stale beer and lost hope. My suit was wrinkled, my tie loose, and my shirt stained with coffee from a clumsy spill that morning, though I wasn\u2019t sure it mattered anymore. It had been the worst day of my life, the kind that left a permanent scar on your soul.\n\nThe call had come at 9:00 a.m., just as I was settling into my desk. I knew it was bad news before I picked up the receiver; the HR manager\u2019s voice was too soft, too rehearsed. Budget cuts, they said. Nothing personal, they said. \u201cWe appreciate your contributions.\u201d But no amount of corporate jargon could mask the fact that I was being tossed out like yesterday\u2019s garbage.\n\nBy noon, the contents of my desk were packed into a cardboard box, and I was out on the street, jobless for the first time in fifteen years. It was raining then, too, a cruel metaphor, as if the universe had decided to mock me. I thought about calling Rachel, my wife, but decided against it. She\u2019d been distant lately, her patience frayed by my long hours and dwindling paychecks.\n\nI didn\u2019t have to call her. She called me.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore, Eric,\u201d she said, her voice trembling but firm.\n\nI knew what was coming. We\u2019d been circling this drain for months.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve filed for divorce,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019ll send over the paperwork. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nThat was it. No tears, no drawn-out explanations. Just a clean, efficient severing of the life we\u2019d built together. I sat in my car for an hour after the call, staring at the steering wheel, feeling the weight of everything crushing me.\n\nSo here I was, drowning my sorrows in whiskey at O\u2019Malley\u2019s, the only place in town where no one cared if you fell apart. The bartender, a grizzled man named Frank, slid me another glass without a word. The amber liquid burned as it went down, but the pain was a welcome distraction.\n\n\u201cRough day?\u201d a voice came from the seat beside me.\n\nI hadn\u2019t even noticed anyone sit down. Turning my head, I saw a man who didn\u2019t quite fit the bar\u2019s atmosphere. He was impeccably dressed in a charcoal-gray suit that looked like it cost more than my car. His hair was slicked back, and his dark eyes sparkled with an unsettling mix of amusement and curiosity.\n\n\u201cYou could say that,\u201d I muttered before taking another swig, not in the mood for small talk.\n\nHe smiled, revealing perfect white teeth. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s more than rough\u201d he leaned in closer. \u201cYou\u2019ve hit rock bottom, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nI stiffened, the words cutting deeper than they should have. \u201cWhat\u2019s it to you?\u201d\n\nHe chuckled in a low, rich sound. \u201cLet\u2019s just say I have a talent for recognizing desperation. And you, my friend, are radiating it.\u201d\n\nI turned away, but he wasn\u2019t deterred.\n\n\u201cLost your job today,\u201d he said, as if it were a casual observation. \u201cAnd your wife, too. Oo now that\u2019s quite the double blow,\u201d he chuckled again. \n\nMy blood ran cold. \u201cHow the hell do you know that?\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t answer immediately. Instead, he signaled to Frank for two drinks, one for himself and another for me. When the glasses arrived, he raised his in a toast.\n\n\u201cTo new beginnings,\u201d he said, his voice smooth as silk.\n\nI didn\u2019t move. \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\nHe leaned in closer, his grin widening. \u201cLet\u2019s just say I\u2019m someone who can help.\u201d\n\n\u201cHelp?\u201d I scoffed. \u201cUnless you\u2019ve got a job and a time machine in that fancy suit of yours, I don\u2019t see how.\u201d\n\nThe stranger\u2019s eyes gleamed. \u201cOh, I can do much better than that. I can give you everything you\u2019ve ever wanted\u2014money, power, love. A fresh start. All I ask in return is something you won\u2019t even miss.\u201d\n\nI laughed bitterly. \u201cLet me guess: my soul?\u201d I took another drink. \n\nHe tilted his head, feigning surprise. \u201cAh, you\u2019ve heard this pitch before. But tell me, Eric, what\u2019s your soul really worth? You\u2019re miserable, broken. What if I told you that all of this,\u201d he raised his hands and gestured all around him, \u201cyour failures, your pain, your loss, could all disappear with a single\u2026 stroke?\u201d\n\nI stared at him, half-convinced I was hallucinating. The whiskey had dulled my senses, but there was something unnervingly real about him.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d I asked finally.\n\n\u201cDeadly.\u201d He said without blinking as he pushed a sleek black pen and a folded piece of parchment toward me. The paper looked ancient, the writing on it ornate and otherworldly.\n\n\u201cAll you have to do,\u201d he said, \u201cis sign.\u201d There was excitement and anticipation in his voice. \n\nI hesitated, my hand hovering over the pen. My rational mind screamed at me to walk away, to laugh this off as some elaborate prank. But the darkness inside me whispered something else. \u201cDo it,\u201d I heard in my head. It sounded like the stranger\u2019s voice, but how could it have been? His lips hadn\u2019t moved. It was a thought I had in my head, wasn\u2019t it?\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the catch?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a catch,\u201d he admitted matter of factly. \u201cBut wouldn\u2019t you rather live your life like a king, even for a short while, than waste away in obscurity?\u201d\n\nI looked around the bar, at the peeling wallpaper and the flickering neon sign. This wasn\u2019t just rock bottom. It was the grave I\u2019d been digging for myself for years.\n\nThe stranger leaned in again, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. \u201cPicture this: tomorrow morning, you wake up in a penthouse. There\u2019s a seven-figure balance in your bank account. Then the phone rings. It\u2019s your dream job, begging you to join their team. Rachel? She\u2019s begging to come back, but fuck her! You\u2019re too busy deciding which of your many admirers is worth your time. This isn\u2019t a fantasy, Eric. This is real. I can make it happen.\u201d\n\nMy throat tightened. It did sound like the perfect life. The life I had dreamed. The life I deserved! Hadn\u2019t I earned it? Worked my ass off only to get let go, tried to save a failing marriage. I poured my heart and soul into everything! And what did as I get as a thank you. I got jack-shit! \n\nAs I reached for the pen, something inside me, something buried deep, made me stop. My mother\u2019s voice, soft and full of faith, echoed in my mind: \u201cWhen you\u2019re lost, Eric, pray. God listens, even when you feel like no one else does.\u201d\n\nI dropped my head into my hands, closed my eyes, and began to pray. My words were clumsy, desperate, and tear soaked. It was a plea for strength, for guidance, for a sign that I wasn\u2019t alone in this darkness.\n\nThe stranger\u2019s smile vanished, replaced by a sharp glare.\n\n\u201cPraying? To Him?\u201d  he sneered, his voice cold and dripping with contempt. \u201cEric don\u2019t waste your time. Do you really think He\u2019s going to swoop in and save you now? After all you\u2019ve been through? Where was He when you lost your job? When your wife walked away? When you cried yourself to sleep, begging for just one break? He\u2019s not listening. He never was.\u201d\n\nI tightened my eyes shut, ignoring the mocking venom in his tone. I whispered another prayer, more insistent this time.\n\nThe stranger\u2019s calm began to crack. His voice turned sharp, filled with agitation. \u201cStop it,\u201d he demanded, leaning in so close I could feel the unnatural chill radiating from him. \u201cYou think muttering those words will change anything? You think He cares about you? Look at your life, Eric! He\u2019s the reason you\u2019re here. He let you fail. He let you fall.\u201d\n\nI gripped the edge of the bar, my knuckles white as I continued to pray.\n\n\u201cEnough!\u201d the stranger barked, slamming his hand on the bar. The glasses rattled, the sound piercing the heavy air. His composed demeanor slipped further, his face contorting into something darker, more feral. \u201cDo you hear me, Eric? He. Does. Not. Care!\u201d His voice grew louder with each word, almost a roar. \u201cWhy waste your breath on a God who abandoned you when you needed Him most?\u201d\n\nI opened my eyes just enough to glance at him, his face twisted with frustration. I closed them again and started to pray again. \n\n\u201cEric you\u2019re throwing away the only real chance you\u2019ve got!\u201d His voice was no longer smooth and enticing; it was raw, jagged, desperate. \u201cLook at me, Eric. I\u2019m here. I\u2019m offering you something tangible. A way out of this misery. God isn\u2019t coming to save you! He doesn\u2019t care if you rot in this bar or die in the gutter.\u201d\n\nI ignored him as my prayers grew louder, the words clumsy but filled with growing conviction.\n\nThe stranger snarled, his voice dropping into something inhuman. \u201cStop it! You think He\u2019s going to help you? You\u2019re nothing to Him! You\u2019re a  speck. A failure. A man who couldn\u2019t even keep his life together. And yet here I am, offering you salvation, and you\u2019d rather grovel to a deity who asks for your unwavering faith and devotion but offers nothing in return?!\u201d\n\nI opened my eyes as he stood, towering over me as the stool was thrown to the ground. The shadows around him deepening, his eyes glowing faintly with a sinister light. \u201cYou\u2019re wasting precious time,\u201d he hissed, jabbing a finger at the contract on the bar. \u201cSign the fucking paper, Eric! Let go of this foolish hope. It\u2019s pathetic. You think you\u2019re strong enough to get through this without me? You\u2019re not. You\u2019re nothing without me.\u201d\n\nI raised my head, meeting his gaze. There was a calmness in me now, something steady and resolute that hadn\u2019t been there before. Then, I felt something. It felt like a hand. A fatherly hand on my shoulder from somewhere behind me. It was firm, but most importantly, comforting. \n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m nothing,\u201d I said quietly, \u201cthen why are you so desperate?\u201d\n\nThe stranger flinched as though struck, his eyes widening in shock. For a moment, the mask he wore slipped completely, revealing something monstrous beneath the surface. His perfectly polished exterior flickered like a bad signal, the illusion cracking and warping. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d he hissed, his voice a guttural growl. \u201cYou\u2019re throwing away everything! He doesn\u2019t deserve your prayers. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s here. I\u2019m the one offering you a way out.\u201d\n\nI stood, pushing the pen and parchment back toward him. \u201cNo,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cYou\u2019re offering chains.\u201d\n\nThe stranger\u2019s composure shattered. He bared his teeth, now sharp and gleaming like blades. The air around him seemed to vibrate with an unnatural energy, the shadows swirling like a living thing. \u201cYou\u2019ll regret this,\u201d he snarled, his voice distorted, almost unrecognizable. \u201cYou\u2019ll come crawling back to me when you realize He\u2019s not coming for you. And when you do, the price will be so much, much worse.\u201d\n\nI held my ground, meeting his gaze. \u201cI\u2019d rather take my chances with Him than spend a second chained to you.\u201d\n\nHis fury exploded, a guttural roar filling the bar as the lights flickered and the shadows closed in. Then, as quickly as it began, the storm of his anger subsided. He straightened his suit, the edges of his form flickering one last time before solidifying.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t over, Eric,\u201d he growled, his voice low and venomous. And then, with a sharp snap, he vanished, leaving behind the pen and parchment.\n\nThe storm outside had stopped. I looked down at the bar, at the empty glass in front of me, and for the first time all day, I felt something stir inside me\u2026hope."},"70":{"title":"Hello Neighbor ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1h1fgv7\/hello_neighbor\/","flair":"Story","author":"TheRealMrImpossible","selftext":"**Hello Neighbor**\n\nI\u2019ve been noticing a few weird things about my neighbor. Like he constantly stakes outside, looking like he\u2019s waiting for something. I\u2019ve caught him cutting his hand a few times and feeding it into his ground. I have no idea what he\u2019s trying to do.\n\nIt would probably be useful to mention that he has a daughter, or had a daughter really. They haven\u2019t talked in years when, all of a sudden, he got a knock on his door informing him that she was caught into a car accident though he doesn\u2019t really believe them.\n\nYeah, I should talk about that, huh? He thinks these human crow cult things killed her and that they\u2019re after him. It\u2019s ridiculous, I know but he\u2019s a paranoid man. He says they also killed his wife which I call bullshit on. The knife was in his kitchen, his fingerprints all over everything. There was no sign of a forced entry but not enough evidence to lock him away either.\u00a0\n\nYeah, clearly he has some issues. Believing there\u2019s a council of gods with one of them being a god of Unfortunate taking the place of a crow like a human figure? I call bullshit once again. He clearly just needs some help but he won\u2019t admit it.\n\nI try talking to him every time I leave the house but to no avail. I wave and he blocks me out like he does most things. I try to invite him to a party but he doesn\u2019t answer either. Everything I do has no effect on him. I could stab him and nothing would happen, he wouldn\u2019t even acknowledge me.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOne day, I went to his door and knocked to give him a thing of muffins but no answer, as I figured though I saw the door was unlocked. I creeked it open a little bit to see if he was home but, instead of my neighbor, I saw a horrific sight. There was blood stained into the hardwood floor ground, it\u2019s clearly been collecting for months. A little farther in there was like a demonic symbol. Like one of these you\u2019d do a ritual with.\u00a0\n\nI take a few steps inside to see ramblings carved into the walls. I knew he was deteriorating mentally but I didn't know this much. The words aren\u2019t words, they\u2019re just symbols. It looks alien to me. As I look around more, I see plenty of weapons lying about like a hacksaw and a knife. A long one at that.\n\n\u201cGet out\u201d said my neighbor, which caused me to jolt up and run out. He slammed the door as I exited and stared at me as I entered my house. I sit there, looking at the house for a minute before going back and trying to push the event to the back of my mind.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s been a few days since then but I feel like I\u2019m being watched. Like his eyes are still on me. He\u2019s put a stick with a dead crow through it on his front yard. I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s done this yet but I figured I\u2019d tell you about all of this mom. I know you like letters instead of texts so I made this.

It started when I got to the episode The Runaway Bride. It started as usual but things got weird during the wedding.

After the \u201cwhat?\u201d stopped looping, the screen went red but the episode was fine other than that. However, when Donna and The Doctor are on the roof, Donna jumped off. Like not even some bad CGI, she just actually jumped off. It cut to a close up of The Doctor and he was just sobbing and sobbing. I was very confused because I was sure that I had seen in other episodes later on. The tape then showed Donna just lying there, dead. He head was smashed, as though she had hit the floor with the weight of a million bricks. Then it was a long, drawn out, silent funeral. All the characters looked like PNGs. Like something a 4 year old fan would make in capcut. The credits rolled and the tape ended. I literally just left the tapes box and went back to my room.

Maybe if I say it out loud, it\u2019ll make more sense. Maybe not.\n\nThis happened eleven days ago. My wife says we shouldn\u2019t talk about it anymore, for Sam\u2019s sake. She hasn\u2019t stopped crying when she thinks I can\u2019t hear her. But I need to tell someone. I need someone to tell me I\u2019m not losing my mind.\n\nWe were driving back from a camping trip\u2014me, my wife, and our two kids, Ellie (10) and Sam (6). It was late, later than it should\u2019ve been. We\u2019d misjudged the distance, and the kids were whining about being hungry. So when we saw a diner, one of those 24-hour places that look exactly like every other diner on earth, we pulled in.\n\nThere was hardly anyone inside. A waitress at the counter. An old guy in a booth near the back, staring out the window like he wasn\u2019t really there. We picked a table by the door.\n\nEllie was the one who noticed it. She\u2019s always been the observant one.\n\n\u201cWhy is that man in our car?\u201d\n\nI was distracted, looking at the menu, and barely registered what she said. \u201cWhat man?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the car,\u201d she said, like it was obvious. \u201cHe\u2019s in my seat.\u201d\n\nI glanced out the window, at our car parked right in front of us. I didn\u2019t see anyone.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one there, Ellie,\u201d I said.\n\nShe frowned. \u201cYes, there is. He\u2019s in the back seat. He\u2019s smiling at me.\u201d\n\nThe way she said it\u2014it wasn\u2019t scared or playful. It was flat, matter-of-fact. My stomach knotted.\n\nI turned to my wife. She gave me a look like, *just humor her,*\u00a0but something about Ellie\u2019s face stopped me from brushing it off.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go check,\u201d I said.\n\nThe car was locked. No sign of anyone inside. I looked through the windows, even opened the doors to check. Empty. I told myself she was just tired. Kids imagine things.\n\nWhen I got back inside, the booth was empty.\n\nMy wife was standing, frantic, calling Ellie\u2019s name. Sam was crying. I scanned the diner. The waitress looked confused, asking what was wrong. Ellie was gone.\n\nWe tore that place apart. The bathrooms, the parking lot, the kitchen. Nothing. My wife kept yelling at the waitress, asking if she saw anyone take Ellie. The waitress just shook her head, looking more and more panicked.\n\nThe police came and asked all the questions you\u2019d expect. The cameras outside the diner didn\u2019t work. They said they\u2019d file a report, but I could see it in their eyes\u2014they thought she\u2019d wandered off.\n\nShe didn\u2019t wander off.\n\nI\u2019ve been going back to the diner. I don\u2019t tell my wife or Sam. I just sit there, staring out the window, holding Ellie\u2019s shoe. Wondering what happened. Watching for the old man.\n\nI can\u2019t stop thinking about him\u2014how he didn\u2019t eat, didn\u2019t talk, didn\u2019t even look at us. Just sat there, staring out the window. I\u2019m sure he had something to do with it, but I don\u2019t know how.\n\nThe last time I went, I sat in my car afterward. I was so tired I must\u2019ve dozed off, and when I woke up, I saw her. Ellie.\n\nShe was in the diner, sitting at the booth where the old man had been, smiling at me and waving. The old man was behind her, standing still as a statue.\n\nI ran inside, but they were gone. Just gone.\n\nI lost it. I started yelling, demanding answers from the waitress and the cook. I must\u2019ve looked like a lunatic. When the cook tried to calm me down, I punched him.\n\nThe police came. I was arrested.\n\nThey let me go the next day, \u201con my own recognizance.\u201d I was given a no-contact order for the diner.\n\nAnd now I\u2019m sitting here, terrified, holding a shoe and knowing I\u2019ll never get answers.

I can\u2019t stop seeing her face in the diner, smiling and waving.\n\nIf I ever saw her again, would I even be able to save her? Or would she vanish, just like before?\n\nI don\u2019t know what to believe anymore.\n\nI don\u2019t know what I expected when my wife invited her numerologist to our house. But I definitely didn\u2019t expect *that*.\n\nHer name was Linda, some woman my wife had been seeing for months, or so she\u2019d told me. I thought it was just some harmless thing\u2014she seemed to believe in all sorts of oddities, but I\u2019d never paid it much attention. I had bigger things to worry about. But when Linda came over, she said something I\u2019ll never forget.\n\nI was in the kitchen, pacing, trying to get a grip. My wife had made me promise not to leave the house while the police did their investigation. My mind was spinning in circles, constantly replaying that damn shoe in the car. I barely noticed when Linda sat down at the kitchen table, her eyes locked on me with this unnerving intensity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Appalachian ley line,\u201d she said out of nowhere.\n\nI looked at her like she\u2019d lost her mind. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t flinch. She just stared at me, like she knew I wouldn\u2019t believe it, but was going to say it anyway.\n\n\u201cYour daughter, Ellie,\u201d she continued, \u201chas always had a connection to a place beyond this one. A liminal place. It\u2019s not just a dream or some trick of the mind. She\u2019s part of something older than you can understand. The Appalachian ley line. It\u2019s ancient. And she\u2019s the seventh hundred and sixtieth watcher.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t help it. I scoffed. \u201cA watcher? What is this, some kind of *role-playing game*\u00a0nonsense? You seriously expect me to believe this?\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t even blink. She was calm, almost too calm. \u201cEllie has assumed the role of the sole observer. She sees what no one else can. Her disappearance\u2014it\u2019s not a tragedy, not a crime. It\u2019s a natural consequence of her ability to see what others cannot.\u201d\n\nI felt a cold knot of panic tighten in my stomach. *What*\u00a0was she saying? I could barely keep my hands still.\n\n\u201cListen to yourself,\u201d I snapped. \u201cThis is a bunch of made-up garbage. I don\u2019t care what kind of scam you\u2019re running, but\u2014\u201d\n\nBefore I even realized what I was doing, I grabbed her by the arm and shoved her toward the door.\n\nMy wife jumped up, shouting at me to stop, trying to pull me back, but I couldn\u2019t hear her. I was *done*. I was losing my mind, and all this nonsense\u2014this ridiculous story about ley lines and watchers\u2014was the breaking point.\n\nI don\u2019t know how it happened, but in the chaos, my elbow caught my wife in the face. She staggered backward, holding her cheek, eyes wide with shock.\n\nThe sound of her gasp snapped me out of it. I looked at her\u2014her face, swollen already\u2014and then I saw Linda staring at me, her eyes wide with a mix of fear and disgust.\n\nI couldn\u2019t breathe. I froze, realizing what I\u2019d done.\n\nThat\u2019s when the police showed up. My wife had already called them. I was arrested again, this time for *aggravated second-degree assault*\u2014on Linda and on my wife. They took me to the station. My wife didn\u2019t say a word. She wouldn\u2019t look at me. I was left in a cell, feeling like the last shred of sanity I had left was slipping away.\n\nI was released the next day\u2014on my own recognizance. But the cops gave me a no-contact order for my wife and two counts of assault to deal with. I tried to go back home, but my wife was gone.\n\nI ended up in a hotel room by myself. The place was cheap\u2014just a room with cracked walls and a bed that didn\u2019t even smell fresh. I had a shower and then tried to get some sleep. It was late. I\u2019d gone to bed exhausted, my mind a mess. But I couldn\u2019t sleep.\n\nI got up, needing to clear my head, and went into the bathroom. The mirror was still fogged over from the shower, and I almost didn\u2019t notice at first.\n\nBut when I looked again, I saw it.\n\n*I luv dad, ellie, 760*\n\nThe letters were traced in the fog. It made my stomach drop. I stood there, staring at it, like I was in some kind of trance. It couldn\u2019t be her. It couldn\u2019t be. But the words\u2014*760*\u2014the same number Linda had mentioned.\n\nI rushed back into the room, staring out the window at the road, at the diner. It was some distance away, down the flat, empty road. The place was deserted now, just like always.\n\nBut I couldn\u2019t stop looking at it. I could feel the pull of that place\u2014the diner, that spot, that *connection*\u00a0I didn\u2019t understand.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m losing my mind. I have to be.\n\nI can\u2019t explain the way I felt when I saw those words. It was like something inside me snapped. Ellie\u2019s message wasn\u2019t just a note\u2014it was a sign. She\u2019s *there*\u2014but not in the way I want her to be. Not in the way I can understand."},"75":{"title":"Jersey Shore Devil","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1gws4b9\/jersey_shore_devil\/","flair":"Story","author":"dlschindler","selftext":"Freelance photography of celebrities has a bad reputation, calling me a paparazzi. I'm considered a kind of media pirate, stealing images, precious-valuable images of celebrities. Invading their privacy, exposing them to scandal and ridicule, sure, but what is a celebrity, anyway?\n\nOlder civilizations considered actors to be the lowest form of entertainers, unworthy of recognition. We're delivered by doctors, protected by soldiers and guided by teachers, but it is the person telling jokes that we celebrate. Clowns, adult-pretenders or laughing stock. Being an actor wasn't celebrated, the root-word of celebrity, but rather considered the ultimate failure, unable to contribute to society in any meaningful way besides mere amusement.\n\nIt was only with the advent of photography that the modern celebrity was born. It was the craft of the candid photographer that affirmed that celebrities should have their status, wealth and influence. Truly the celebrity is a king with a golden crown, and no longer the obnoxious class clown.\n\nSo, I am the villain, for making my meager living by keeping it real, and taking a few pictures for the media who actually profit from my work. If I am the bad guy, I'd like to expose the victim of my camera for what she really is. I was horrified to discover the truth, the reality of these stars of ours, and as a teller of truth, I am just the middleman.\n\nThey say no photograph is worth dying for. But when you're a freelance photographer, chasing leads is how you survive. I didn\u2019t think twice when I got the tip about Kream Kardinian's Jersey Shore mansion. The world hadn\u2019t seen her in two years, but rumors about her\u2014gruesome, salacious rumors\u2014never stopped.\n\nTwelve fetuses in jars. That\u2019s what the message claimed. Abandoned by her celebrity circle after a string of messy public feuds, Kream supposedly fled to her family estate to live in total isolation. No press, no paparazzi, no public sightings. The story practically wrote itself\u2014if it was true.\n\nI arrived just after dusk, parking my car a half mile away and hiking through dense woods until I found the mansion. It loomed against the dark sky, its silhouette as cold and silent as the rumors. The windows were dark, and the air around the place was unnaturally still. Even the wind felt like it avoided the grounds.\n\nI set up camp in the bushes near what used to be a garden, the overgrown hedges offering partial cover. I waited, clutching my camera and using its zoom like binoculars, hoping to spot movement, a light, *anything*. But the mansion stayed lifeless, its windows like blind eyes staring into the void.\n\nHours passed. My nerves were frayed, and I was starting to consider leaving when I saw it\u2014a faint sliver of light from a side door. A servant\u2019s entrance, left ajar. My heart raced. This was it. An opportunity.\n\nI hesitated, weighing my fear against the pull of the story. Then, before I could talk myself out of it, I darted across the unkempt lawn, my shoes crunching softly on the gravel. The garden smelled of decay and damp earth, and the door, cracked open, seemed to invite me in\u2014or warn me away.\n\nInside, the mansion was silent, the kind of silence that presses against your ears and amplifies your every move. The air was thick with dust, and the floorboards creaked with every step I took. I tried to stay quiet, tried to convince myself no one had heard me.\n\nAt first, I thought the place was abandoned. The grand foyer was stripped of its grandeur, its chandeliers hanging like skeletal remains from cobwebbed ceilings. Hallways stretched endlessly in every direction, their peeling wallpaper seeming to close in on me the longer I stared.\n\nBut something felt *wrong*.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the emptiness\u2014it was the *wrongness*\u00a0of it. The kind of wrong that makes the hair on your neck stand up. Every door I opened revealed more of the same: empty rooms, faded furniture, and the faint smell of mildew. But as I ventured deeper, I felt it. A presence.\n\nIt started as a faint sensation, like being watched, but soon it grew unbearable. I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I wasn\u2019t alone. That something unseen was stalking me. The shadows seemed to stretch longer, the air heavier with every step I took.\n\nIn one of the rooms, after I picked the lock, I found a row of glass jars lined up on a dusty shelf. My hands shook as I brought my flashlight closer. The glass was fogged, the contents murky, but inside\u2026something floated. Small, unrecognizable shapes. My stomach turned, bile rising in my throat.\n\nI backed away, nearly tripping over the edge of a moth-eaten rug. That\u2019s when I heard it\u2014a faint creak, like a footstep, from somewhere deeper in the house. My breath hitched, and I froze, listening.\n\nAnother creak. Closer.\n\nI turned off my flashlight and pressed myself against the wall, my pulse pounding in my ears. The footsteps were deliberate, unhurried, and they echoed through the cavernous halls, growing louder with every passing second.\n\nI couldn\u2019t stay. Whatever was in the house with me\u2014I didn\u2019t want to meet it.\n\nI crept back the way I came, the sound of my own footsteps swallowed by the overwhelming silence. But as I neared the servant's entrance, I saw it: the door was closed.\n\nMy heart sank. I didn\u2019t remember closing it.\n\nI fumbled with the lock, the sound of it snapping open echoing through the hall. I heard another footstep, and then the sound of something whooshing through the air, like a flag snapping in a wind. I raised my camera instinctively as I turned, and took several pictures with the flash.\n\nAs my eyes widened in terror at the shape of the thing in the dim hallway, the dust it had kicked up whiffed around me. For a moment I wasn't sure what I was seeing, just this massive shape of something looming there, in the liminal between the light and the dark, stepping out at me like a performer taking the stage.\n\nMy eyes were locked onto it, my hands shaking so violently that I dropped my camera onto the floor, the action-strap slipping over my limp wrist. I gripped the handle of the door behind me, opening it with my back to it, and edging myself outside, into the night.\n\nThere is this difficulty I have in describing what I saw, that thirteenth pregnancy, the one from a few years ago. It was definitely the child of Kream Kardinian, since it had her eyes, her lips. Those full lips of hers are her actual lips, as this thing inherited them from its mother.\n\nWearing its mother's face, the rest of the child was all wrong. It stood a whole eight or nine feet tall and had massive bat wings instead of arms. Well it had arms, and they were short and muscular, with fingers like pool noodles that had the tanned membranes to form its batlike wings.\n\nThe creature's body was draped in a colorful bathrobe, custom-made to fit its elongated body, so that its posture was more like a kangaroo, and having a long prehensile tail, with human skin covering it. The legs were bent in an unnatural backwards way, more like a bird, but had stretched and thin human bones in them, and thick wobbly kneecaps. I stared at its feet, somehow the most disturbing part of it.\n\nThe feet looked exactly like they should on a toddler, just two perfect little feet on the thing. It looked at me with curiosity and intelligence, tilting its almost human head to one side as though it wondered why I was so terrified of it.\n\nAs I closed the door I heard it start crying, and it sounded indistinguishable from the pouting of a small child. For a moment my heart felt wrong for fleeing it, but then its devilish spiked horn on the right side of its skull erupted point-first through the door, as it had charged at me and attacked.\n\nI fell to the ground as it withdrew its lopsided horn from the door and looked through, staring at me with an all-too human eye.\n\nThat is when the horror of its appearance finally struck me and I instinctively shielded myself with my arms from eye contact with its gaze and by screaming in terrified defiance. I clambered to my feet and retreated the way I had intruded.\n\nWhen I had safely driven away I looked back, and I could swear I saw some massive batlike shape winging its way across the skies of the Jersey Shore in front of the bright moon.\n\nI have no photographic evidence of what I saw, and I lacked the commitment to my trade to have taken pictures that I came for when I found Kream's collection of her previous pregnancies. I know what I saw in her home, I admit to my burglary, only because I know what I saw.\n\nPerhaps I am not cut out for this job, after-all."},"76":{"title":"What A Wrathful One","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1gw8pnf\/what_a_wrathful_one\/","flair":"Story","author":"TheRealMrImpossible","selftext":"\u201cLocal Policeman found dead in abandoned alleyway.\u201d I read the newspaper aloud to myself when my knocking commenced upon the door. I get up to answer it, confused on who it could be especially at this time of night. I swing the door open to be greeted by a Police officer whose name tag was missing, weird.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHello sir? How can I help you\u201d I questioned the police officer as he entered my apartment, not saying anything. I close the front door to keep my apartment warm and cosy. I watch him closely, not sure why he\u2019s here or why he\u2019s not saying anything. \u201cI\u2019ll go get us cups of coffee then sir.\u201d With that, I enter the kitchen as my eyes fall off him.\n\nAfter making the cups of coffee, I re-enter the living-room to see the officer missing. Where did he go? My eyes land on the front door to which hasn\u2019t seemed to be touched at all. I look around, not talking really as I got no response last time. I see his gun on the table along with his badge so I figured he went to the bathroom as there aren\u2019t any other explanations.\u00a0\n\nAll of a sudden, the lights flash out. I can\u2019t see a single thing in the pitch blackness which makes me reach for my phone flashlight immediately. I turn it on, taking a look around when I see a weird slimy substance on the ground leading to my bedroom. I slowly crouch down to investigate the mysterious substance, curious. I look at my bedroom door before standing back up carefully.\u00a0\n\nI stare at my door before taking a careful, quiet step to not step into the substance when, out of nothingness, eyes appear. They\u2019re soulless, lifeless in fact. I\u2019ve never seen anything like them before. All they do is just stare me down asI slowly back away to the front door, planning on making a break for it.\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s when the thing started to walk towards me so I tried to grab the doorknob but it\u2019s not there anymore. It\u2019s\u2026 away again. Far back so I go and run for it but, it seems, no matter what I do, I can\u2019t reach the door. I feel stuck in place but able to move, like I\u2019m running in place. The thing only creeps closer, its twisted, cynical smile coming into view as I look behind me one last time then at the gun.\u00a0\n\nI make a break to the gun but, again, the distance between me and the counter seems to grow everytime I take a step, staying at the same distance the entire time. I don\u2019t bother to look behind me again, everything feels like there is no escape. I fall to the ground, hugging my knees and hiding my face in the aforementioned knees. A tear falls and slides down my cheeks silently as I wish I could make it out of this nightmare, somehow. Whatever way that is.\u00a0\n\n"},"77":{"title":"Devour","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1gv9ax6\/devour\/","flair":"Story","author":"WritingMothman","selftext":"Mina had always been a biter.\u00a0\n\nAs a baby, her mother could not nurse her. The pain of feeding her was too much to bear. Pulling her child away to find milk and blood was enough for her mother to call it quits. She gnawed on teething toys before her teeth ever came in. Bit her hands and fingers till they bled. Small scars had littered her skin long before age took them away. She was leaving faded marks of her self-mutilation. Her mother had to cover Mina\u2019s hands in vinegar to get the child to stop biting herself. The problem had only temporarily subsided.\n\nIn first grade, her parents had gotten a call from the school that she had bitten a young boy. When asked why, she didn\u2019t have an answer. The boy\u2019s hand had been a bloody mess\u2014deep punctures from uneven teeth lines. Mina had been silent on the matter. The strangest thing about the ordeal had been her silence. The boy had whined and cried, claimed that Mina was a freak, and wanted nothing to do with her. She was transferred to another class. Her teachers assured Mina\u2019s parents that while the matter had been violent, she was just a child and should just be reprimanded not to do it again.\n\nMina was aware there was something wrong with her. There was a gaping ache inside, and nothing ever filled it\u2014a hunger that never escaped her.\u00a0\n\nAs a child, she assumed it would go away if she ate. She tried drinking different drinks: milk, water, and soda. Yet none of these things helped. One night, nearing morning, Mina went to the kitchen and grabbed the sirloin her father had been saving for dinner. The raw steak was in her hand, and she bit into the red flesh of the beef. The texture was cold and harsh, but she ripped it with her teeth and ate. Her hands were covered in the blood that seeped out. She felt hollow once more. The blood, the meat, the *rawness* of it, was not enough.\n\nMina cried and cried, unable to be satisfied.\u00a0\n\nThe ache had simmered down only once in her life and came in the form of a cat.\u00a0\n\nMina was in third grade, waiting for the bus outside her house. The pasture across the street was vast and dark. Mina stared out into that abyss every morning, wanting it to consume her. Maybe then, the ache would leave her. She was alone that morning. However, when is she not alone?\u00a0\n\nA single light pole shined light above the young girl. Her shadow cast long lines on the dark road. She gripped her backpack tight. In the tall grass in the pasture, there was movement. Mina froze. She stared hard at the grass that swayed until a small black cat came from the void. They stared at each other for a moment. The cat hunched in fear before slowly walking toward the girl. Mina had stayed still, afraid to scare the cat away.\u00a0\n\nThe black cat came a few feet away and looked her over. Mina reached for the lunch box in her backpack and opened it. The cat scattered, but Mina still grabbed the uneaten sandwich. She noticed the cat had hidden back in the grass and put the sandwich on the ground beside her. Mina stepped back further into the driveway to give the cat space. With slow steps, the cat approached her. She was eyeing both the sandwich and her. Finally, she smelled the bread and took a bite.\n\nThe cat was starving. Its jaw was unhinged as it devoured the food offered. It filled itself in a way that Mina never could. Mina waited for the cat to finish. The bus was sure to show up soon, but she had yet to make plans to get on. The cat approached her soon after and brushed against her legs in gratitude. Mina named the cat Mary, and she had become her best friend.\u00a0\n\nMary wasn\u2019t allowed in the house because her parents didn\u2019t like cats. However, Mina diligently took care of her. She would sneak the cat inside at night so she could sleep with her. She would cuddle the black fur and fill a space long since vacant. Mina realized that it wasn\u2019t just a hunger that the ache desired. It was love. Mary would purr, and Mina wouldn\u2019t feel alone.\u00a0\n\nThey were best friends. Where Mina went, Mary would follow. Mary would wait in the driveway when the bus picked up and dropped Mina off. Mary would stay at the door to be secretly let in at night. She would meow to the girl whenever she came home as if greeting her. She grew up with the young girl and became a big, pretty cat.\u00a0\n\nMina hadn\u2019t felt the ache in a while. She whispered to the black cat, \u201c*I never wish to lose you.\u201d* With reverence, she took care of her little Mary. She told the cat how much she adored her\u2014dreamed of a life where no one else had to exist, just her and the only thing that loved her back. However, nothing lasts forever.\u00a0\n\nMina was thirteen when she tasted blood again.\u00a0\n\nIt was on her hands, the same hands that shook as they picked up her only friend. Her body was limp. Head dropping unnaturally to the side and eyes wide open. Her mouth dripped blood onto Mina\u2019s hands as she cradled her body to her chest. The shadows cast harshly into the night. The moon glared down onto the girl who sobbed. She had come outside to look for her when the routine was broken. Mary didn\u2019t appear.\n\nMina had left to look for her, only to find her by the road. Alone and battered, her body had only just started to grow cold. Mina cradled her friend and walked back to the house. Holding her for hours, she didn\u2019t know what to do. Afraid to bury her cat, for it would mean her death was final. She would be alone.\u00a0\n\nShe had pulled away from the cold body and sobbed. She pressed her cheek to Mary\u2019s face, and the blood smeared onto her face. Mina set her cat down on the forgiving soil and dug her a grave. Her hands shaking, and the dirt watered with her sadness, she laid her friend to rest. Mina kissed her cat\u2019s cheek one last time and tasted blood. She held her face close to Mary\u2019s. She looked over her cat\u2019s face, closing her eyes with her other hand and pressing her lips to her cat\u2019s face once more. The blood smeared onto her lip. She licked Mary\u2019s blood off her lips and put Mary into her grave.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou gave me your life, your blood, and made me happy\u2026\u201d Mina whispered. She looked around before grabbing a piece of glass that had shattered long ago. She dug the glass into her palm and pressed the bloody palm to Mary\u2019s side. \u201cNow, I give you my blood, sympathy, and hope. Please, find peace in your next life, for I will not find any in this one without you.\u201d\n\nMina placed flowers on the tiny grave.\u00a0\n\nLife was expected to continue normally, but Mina had something inside her snap. Clicking into place, her hunger grew. She felt as if nothing satisfied her once more. She passed through life with apathy, rarely finding delight in anything. Her all-consuming ache was too much to bear.\u00a0\n\nIt urged her to end her own life many times. She placed her blade to her skin and cut up her arms and was displeased when she remained alive. Sometimes, she\u2019d cut herself and drink the blood. Just to remember the taste of Mary. Her blood tasted different. Her blood didn\u2019t taste like love. It tasted bitter, cold, disgusting.\u00a0\n\nShe longed for someone to love her again and relieve the ache. If there was a God, then they had listened to her prayer.\u00a0\n\nMina had never been interested in other people, not really. She\u2019s had a hard time having friends; even now that she\u2019s a senior in high school, she struggles. She is surprised that people now *want* to be her friend. A small group consisted of a man named Jayden and two women called Megan and Alana.\n\nJayden had been the one to approach her. His attempts to flirt had fallen flat, but he quickly decided that being Mina\u2019s friend was good enough. He invited Megan and Alana with him the next day, Megan being his sister and Alana being her best friend. They poked and prodded at Mina, wanting to know everything about her and eventually deciding that they\u2019d adopt the mysterious introvert into their group.\n\nIt was Alana who talked to Mina alone, though. That would linger when the others left. That would ask if they could walk together. She asked for Mina\u2019s phone number before all the others. Mina was suspicious and asked why. Alana had looked away and smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re cool. I want to know you. Is that so bad?\u201d\n\nMina assumed nothing else of it at the time. Until Alana became a constant, she wanted to hang out alone. Alana stood in Mina\u2019s personal space. She would buy her things, listen to her intently, and blush when Mina touched her. Mina was not an idiot; she simply chose to ignore it. There was too much baggage with her. Mina couldn\u2019t accept what Alana was trying to offer when she could not return it. Mina was *damaged*.\u00a0\n\nAlana didn\u2019t care. She would wait for Mina. Alana had seen the conflict within Mina and was intrigued rather than scared off. She wanted to rip apart each layer that consisted of the thought-provoking woman. She\u2019d do anything for a chance.\u00a0\n\nAnything.\n\nLike most things, it started by accident. Mina had been home alone, and Alana stopped by with a bag of groceries and a bright smile. She had been reluctantly let inside. Mina\u2019s relationship with food had always been tense. Alana made it her mission to make it less uncomfortable, telling her that eating together improved the food. She played her music softly and hummed while cooking in a kitchen that wasn\u2019t hers. Mina only watched.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d Mina asked.\n\nAlana grabbed the knife off the stand and the cutting board. \u201cI want to.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s stupid.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe girl grabbed the onion off the counter and cut into it, ignoring the other's comment. It was silent for a moment before Alana hissed. She dropped the knife onto the counter and held her hand close to herself.\n\nMina smelt it before she saw the blood. Her body froze as Alana turned around, and her finger had been sliced open, blood already pooling into her hand. The smell was intense. Coppery and hot, Mina felt *starving*.\u00a0\n\nAlana, teary and pleading, hesitated to ask for help at the look on Mina\u2019s face. \u201cMina..?\u201d\n\nMina moved slowly. She was reaching out to touch Alana gently. Her wrist being held close, Mina pulled the bloody hand to her mouth. She stared at the wound for a moment. The blood was now dripping onto her fingers. Mina locked eyes with Alana. She could feel her heart race. Pupils blown wide. Breath held in her chest like a bird in a cage. Mina leaned down, eyes still latched to hers and licked the blood off her hand.\u00a0\n\nAlana gasped but didn\u2019t pull away. She watched the girl tongue her wound and was fascinated by the sight of her blood on Mina\u2019s lips. The way it stained her mouth was a pretty color. The fervent desire in Mina\u2019s eyes. All of it made her insides burn. Mina had cleaned her skin of blood when Alana reached behind herself, grabbed the knife, and sliced her arm. Mina\u2019s eyes widened.\u00a0\n\n\u201cAlana-\u201d\n\n\u201cDo it.\u201d Mina didn\u2019t need to be asked twice. She had never felt such satisfaction. Alana\u2019s blood tasted better than anything she\u2019d ever tasted. Her skin was soft, and the blood was pouring. Mina felt high off the feeling of fulfillment as if her hunger had finally been satisfied. The gaping hole inside wasn\u2019t as big anymore. She tasted more of Alana\u2019s skin. Kissing the parts that had been damaged before pulling away. Blood smeared onto her face, and her cheeks flushed. \u201cKiss me.\u201d\n\nSpellbound, Mina did as she was told.\u00a0\n\nAlana held onto her hair, pain forgotten for pleasure. She grabbed Mina\u2019s face and forced her to look at her. She whispered over Mina\u2019s lips, controlling her. \u201cYou\u2019re mine now, got it?\u201d\n\nMina nodded. Whatever she wanted. To taste her blood, Mina would worship the ground she walked on. Alana smiled and tossed the knife into the sink. \u201cThat's enough for today, little vampire.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a vampire-\u201d\n\n\u201cYour thirst says otherwise,\u201d Alana pushed Mina\u2019s lip up to see her teeth. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t look like one.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t real,\u201d Mina said. Grabbing Alana\u2019s hand and glaring at her. \u201cI\u2019m not a monster.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re *my* monster.\u201d\n\nMina let it go. Things continued like this: Alana kept Mina\u2019s secret for a price. An even exchange, she called it. Her life for Mina\u2019s. Her blood for Mina\u2019s affection. Mina would allow her appetite to consume her\u2014an addict with an uncomfortable itch. Alana, being her only fix, became the center of her life.\u00a0\n\nWhere Alana went, Mina did. What Alana wanted, Mina would make it happen. When Alana wanted her on her knees, Mina was already there. Devoted to Alana in a way that even God wished he could compel his worshipers to do.\u00a0\n\nHowever, good things never last. Not when Mina felt her hunger only grow. When the blood wasn\u2019t enough anymore, she wanted to *consume* Alana. She wanted to know everything Alana wore to bed, what she thought about, her favorite music. Mina drank in every detail as much as she drank her blood. Alana couldn\u2019t breathe differently without Mina documenting it in her thoughts. She had become obsessed.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHold me, please,\u201d Alana asked. Mina had crawled into her bed and done as she was told. Silence enveloped them like a blanket. Mina memorized every piece of skin she could touch. She counted her heartbeats, inhaled her scent, and felt the warmth of her body. Mina hugged Alana\u2019s side and waited. Alana rolled to face her. \u201cWill you kill me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just asking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d Mina felt repulsed at the idea at first. Then she thought longer. How would Alana\u2019s skin taste? Not just under her tongue but in her mouth? In her stomach? In her *soul*? \u201cIt\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that the only thing stopping you? Morality?\u201dAlana turned in her arms to look at her. She pushed Mina back onto her spine and straddled her. Alana peered down into Mina\u2019s eyes. \u201cYour hunger will never overcome you?\u201d\n\nMina held her breath. Heartbeat was erratic from its constricting cage. Her hands traveled slowly over the legs that held her down\u2014tethered her in the reality of this moment. Would she do it? Could she control it? The taste of Alana\u2019s blood on her tongue sat heavy. She is reminded of all the years she spent *starving* for this.\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mina whispered.\n\nAlana stared down at her. She gripped the t-shirt Mina was wearing. Her eyes filled with water. \u201cWhat if I wanted you to?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I\u2019d *devour* you.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo it, then.\u201d\n\nMina sat up, Alana falling into her lap. She grabbed Alana\u2019s face, pulling it close to her own. She could see the sadness, fear, and *turmoil* behind her eyes. She didn\u2019t understand Alana\u2019s blunt request. Why, after everything, did she want this now? Mina looked down at Alana\u2019s neck. She pulled the shirt to the side, fingers dancing over her fragile skin. Alana tilted her head back.\u00a0\n\nMina caved. She took a bite out of Alana\u2019s neck. She bit hard onto the soft skin. Alana grabbed her hair and cried out in pain. Her body instinctually jerked away from Mina. Blood gushed into Mina\u2019s mouth, satisfying her hunger. She pulled harshly, and skin hung in between her teeth. She grabbed Alana\u2019s chin and forced her to watch as her jaw moved. Biting down on the chewy flesh that invigorated her. Alana cried at the sight. \u201cI didn\u2019t think\u2026you\u2019d do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said I would devour you. What else could this have possibly led to? You asked, and I delivered.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot-not like this,\u201d Alana whimpered. \u201cI thought,\u201d\n\nMina pushed her back, crawling over her to cage her against the mattress. She felt powerful. Taking the reins when they had been in Alana\u2019s hands the entire time. Her heart, her life, her hunger, all controlled by her. She loved Alana, but there was a certain satisfaction in *using* her. Mina licked away the tears that rolled down Alana\u2019s face. The salty sadness was refreshing.\n\n\u201cYou thought?\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you loved me,\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this not love? You\u2019ll *always* be a part of me.\u201d\n\nWhen Alana looked into Mina\u2019s eyes, heart, and *soul*, no one was staring back. A monster, that had barely been tamed, returned her gaze. Mina was inhuman. She tore her skin, drank her blood, and consumed Alana until there was nothing left. Bone peeked out through ripped skin, and Mina admired the sight.\u00a0\n\nMina, in the end, had *always* been a biter.\n\n  \n"},"78":{"title":"Changing Lights (Final Part)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1gvawk4\/changing_lights_final_part\/","flair":"Story","author":"ZealousidealYam4891","selftext":"A group of sheep lay sleeping in their pen and a dog sat watching them. A whistle filled the air above her and she could smell something odd. Her canine eyes gave her more visibility in the dark and she spotted a large object approaching above. It slowly glided towards the pen and stopped suddenly, releasing a light made of orange. However, through the eyes of the dog, it was just a bright shade of gray. Sounds flooded the dogs ears and they twitched. She watched it surround a sheep then it began to rise. With no fear or hesitation she began to bark. This was not her usual spot that she prowled around. But after what she had been seeing and her love for a very special giant human, a decision was made to follow the man home to watch over him.\n\nThe dog's sounds of alarm did not deter the craft in its pursuit of the unconscious livestock. Her efforts went unnoticed so she scurried towards the log cabin to attempt to wake up the man inside. She stood by the porch and continued her barking. Eventually a light turned on and a lumbering giant walked outside. \"What's going on girl?\" He was surprised by her presence and even more that she was causing such a ruckus. Eventually he understood when he saw the craft lifting one of his sheep. \"Motherfucker.\"\n\nLate in the night, Leroy's sleep was disturbed by the familiar yet sad excuse for the ballad of Big Balls. He rolled over in his bed, not tipping over the cardboard box this time. With his eyes remaining closed he opened the phone and answered. \"What's the matter now, dear?\" His voice was a clear indication of his grogginess. Boomer's voice was hushed when he replied. \"I need you to get over here now. They're here.\" Leroy finally opened his eyes, pulling the phone from his ear to see on the digital face that it was two thirty in the morning. \"Boom, it's after two. Who's there?\" His friend's voice snapped back. \"The fucking aliens. Old man Smolpekir wasn't shittin' us.\" Leroy rolled his eyes and rubbed his face. \"C'mon man, this shit ain't funny. I'll be over tomorrow.\" Boomer's voice turned very serious and it fully woke up Leroy. \"I ain't fuckin around. I'm looking at a godamn flying saucer taking one of my fucking sheep. Get over here now!\" Leroy knew not to dally so he hurried and got dressed while listening to Boomer's description of what he was seeing. \"Alright buddy just stay put. I'll be there in about twenty minutes.\n\n\"Holy shit!\" Leroy exclaimed as he sped down the dirt path leading to Boomers farm. A large metallic object was in the air, spitting out a bright stream light. A sheep was caught in the beam and slowly being taken up. \"This is fucking crazy. That old coot weren't lyin. I need to call Ripleys believe it or not, asap.\" The sad excuse of a car skittered onward, leaving a trail of dust and a stench of burnt antifreeze behind it. Leroy slammed on the breaks when he got to the front of the log cabin. The car's abrupt arrival disrupted the abduction and the sheep was dropped. \nUnfortunately it was up a ways and landed hard on the ground. A bone snapped in its leg, causing the poor creature to scream. This stirred up a commotion which led to a panic amongst the herd. The orange light disappeared and a loud whistle could be heard as the object took off. Leroy got out of his car and ran toward the cabin where he saw Boomer hunkered down on the porch. He was accompanied by the stray dog. \"I think I scared it off.\" Leroy spoke breathlessly. Boomer stood up, patting the dog on the back side. \"No fucking shit. I was hoping you'd be a little sneaky and not scare em away, fuckstick.\" \n\nLeroy apologized and in his defense, he didn't know he was supposed to show up discreetly. It was obvious that the aliens had an interest in Boomer's sheep and all the pieces were falling into place. They had snatched up Daisy and experimented on her. They had experimented on the dog, also known as Kalido in case some of you forgot. And lastly, they had snatched up old man Smolpekir. \n\nThe only question was who else had been victim to the extraterrestrial's games. The men had witnessed a human dick and balls on Daisy and clearly it wasn't from the old man. Who else had they taken? Boomer was beyond angry and started slamming his fist against the walls of his cabin. \"Motherfuckers!!\" The sound scared the sheep into silence and the dog took the hint and disappeared. \nThe outburst was short lived when another cry from the injured sheep returned. Both men ran to it in a hurry and did all they could to comfort the animal and nurse its wound. After that Boomer had a discussion with Leroy on how to take care of the heartless bastards. \"I don't care where they come from or what they can do. You don't hurt animals and you don't abduct people.\" Boomer's voice was filled with passion and ferocity. He pulled out his phone to call his cousin again and hoped he answered this time. Leroy had met him once but barely remembered him. This was back when Boomer and Leroy were kids. Nowadays Boomer's cousin was some kind of supernatural bounty hunter of sorts. He was married and his wife was also employed in the same off the wall profession. \n\nApparently they had experience in the field of weird, creepy and unbelievable shit. Both men were skeptical of that but with little knowledge and the current events opening their eyes, that was the last effort to try and make sense of the situation. Boomer got a hold of his cousin and gave him the details. \"That's definitely contact Boom Boom, expect more to happen in the next few days. They'll only show up at night around the same time, little shits are OCD like that. Just be careful cause if that light hits you and it's green, you may not live through it.\" Boomer continued listening to the countless details about these little green fuckers. Their habits, motives and what to expect when it came to actually being taken up in the craft. Boomer had hoped his cousin would come help but he couldn't. It was the man's wedding anniversary and for the celebration they were hunting. Boomer asked what animal and all his cousin answered with was \"the kind that sucks plasma.\" The call ended shortly after that. Boomer put the phone in his pocket and Leroy waited anxiously. \"Well? What do we do?\" Boomer waited a moment to answer his friend. He opened a pack of cigarettes and lit one before speaking. \"I've got as much information as I could and we're gonna get these little bastards. It's just gonna be you and me though good buddy.\"\nBoomer laid out the idea to watch the craft and learn how often it showed up at his farm and what all it did. He hoped with the knowledge they would gain, a plan of attack would form in his mind.\n\n It was four days before the thing showed up again. As before, it hovered over a sheep, released an orange light then took the animal. It would leave the area and the men timed it, three hours would pass and then it returned to drop off the mutilated animal. Boomer almost broke the gate trying to get in the pen to check on the poor creature after the craft left. It was missing its hind legs and the area around the spine had been picked clean. Exposed bones, singed hair with that black tar beading around the area. The smell of burnt metal and the discoloration of the ground was all present. Boomer drank himself into submission in order to calm himself from the horror of yet another dead friend. He cried, he screamed and eventually put a nice sized hole in the wall. \"I can't fuckin take it! Those fuckers gotta die!\" The cabin shook with the booming force of his voice. Leroy chimed in. \"And what can we do, man? Pretend we're sheep and go up on the damn flying plate. I mean bowl. What the fuck is that word?\" Boomer paused and a lightbulb flickered above his head. \"That's it!\" Leroy looked confused. \"Whatcha mean that's it?\" Things weren't clicking in his head like they were in Boomer's. \"We're gonna get on that fuckin' ship.\" Leroy was still puzzled so Boomer had to break things down Barney style. Bit by bit in the easiest terms and scenarios possible.\n\n\"So you wanna dress up like a sheep and get beamed up into the spaceship? That's your master plan?\" A deep brown glob of chew spit flew from Leroy's mouth. \"Yep. Trick these fuckers to get us up there, then we kill em.\" Boomer was serious in his statement and was becoming quite convincing. By their calculations they had four days before the craft returned. In that time, they had turned Boomer's woodworking shed into a makeshift barn for the sheep. It wasn't very big so they had to spend two of those days building an addition to fit all of the critters inside. The next part of the plan was to remove enough fur from the sheep in order to create a cover that would fit over the two of them.\n\"I gots a question there Indianapolis Jones and the temple of alien abduction.\"\n\n Leroy's face was stern. \"They only take one sheep at a time, so how'r we both gettin' up there?\" Boomer hadn't thought about that thoroughly and scratched his head. \"Well. I guess we'll have to pretend to be just one sheep.\" Leroy didn't like the sound of that and remarked. \"Don't be tryin no funny shit. I don't swing that way.\" A laugh rumbled from the giant. \"Oh come on boo boo. You don't think I'm pertty enough fir ya?\" One found it funny while the other did not. \"Fuck you. I aints no power bottom!\" Once again another laugh filled the air. \"Don't worry baby, I'll go easy on you since I'll be your first.\" Leroy started getting red in the face which soon transitioned into a shade of purple. He went to throw a punch. However he tripped over the laces of his boots and fell. And as his luck would have it, he landed face first on the floor and chipped his front tooth. \"God damnit!\" He got up and inspected his tooth with his tongue. \"Motherfucker. Look what you made me do!\" Boomer shrugged his shoulders. \"I didn't make ya fall, snaggletooth.\" Soon there was shuffling, things breaking and shouting. Kalido the dog sat outside listening to the whole thing. She exhaled through her nose in disappointment and left the ignorant humans to their pointless squabble.\n\nThe day finally arrived for the anticipated return of the UFO. The men had everything prepped, Boomer housed the dog with the sheep. He didn't want her protective habits coming out and causing the craft to fly away prematurely. He also set up an area for his newest rescue, the baby racoon he named Delilah. Leroy convinced Boomer to do some shots to pass the time. He hesitated but the peer pressure was too strong. So needless to say by the time night fell, the two of them were hammered. Hope latched on to this plan like a tick, sucking up as much life as possible. Boomer kept his fingers crossed that the craft would show up and seeing only one sheep, it would take it. By sheep, that would be the decoy of two grown men sharing a sad attempt at an animal fur cloak.\n\nThe moon poked its head out and the men stumbled to the sheep pen. \"How we doin' this? Sheep ain't that wide.\" Leroy was still skeptical. He was referring to the idea of him and Boomer next to each other on their hands and knees pretending to be an animal. And the answer he received didn't sit well with him. \"I guess one of us is gonna have to be on the ground while the other is above. Then we cover ourselves in the fur.\" Leroy swallowed his wad of skoal when he heard this. Anyone who has done that knows how bad it tastes and what it does to your stomach. He started to cough which turned into gagging then soon he threw up all over his boots. \"Ain't. *cough* No *cough* way.\" Leroy spoke while trying to catch his breath, spitting out the remnants of vomit and tobacco. \"Ain't no fuckin way I'm doing that.\" Boomer laid his hand on Leroy's shoulder. \"C'mon don't be a pussy. It won't be for long. Plus you may like it.\" Boomer chuckled. His humor didn't infect his friend who was still slightly dying. \"Fuck you.\"\n\nIt took Boomer putting Leroy in a headlock and a pint of Tennessee whiskey to convince him to go forward with the plan. They assumed position in the field, Leroy on the ground and Boomer above him. They stared into each other's eyes and there was a twinkle in Boomer's oceanic blue peepers. Leroy killed the non-existent spark. \"If I feel a boner, you're getting punched and I'm throwing my knee into your nuts.\" Boomer said nothing as he covered them with a blanket of sheep fur. He was about to give a smart ass comment but instead shushed Leroy when a whistle started to gradually get louder. A bright light surrounded them and both men silently mouthed the words \"Oh shit.\" They felt weightless, their ears started to ring and their stomachs bubbled up with indigestion. \nThe side effects of weightlessness got worse the higher they got. And soon Boomer could see the ground getting farther away from behind Leroy's body. The light got brighter and then there was a cracking sound, almost like violent thunder right before lightning strikes. Their ears popped and they simultaneously let out a loud fart. The gastric expulsion echoed in a pitch black room. It faded and was replaced by clicking sounds far off in the distance. The odd noises grew closer, followed by wet flops of something smacking hard ground. Boomer felt something stiff poking at his back. A faint yellow glow suddenly clicked on and more strange sounds encompassed them. As if a crowd of different birds or crickets surrounded them.\n\nSomething sharp pierced Boomers side and he shouted. \"Shit!\" Without thinking he ripped the camouflage off and he was looking in the black eyes of the creature's that had been tormenting his sheep. There were four of them. Around five feet tall with small oval shaped heads that were placed on necks that looked too slender to hold the cranium up. It was like a football sitting vertically on a pool cue. The heads shifted left to right and the sounds came from holes at the base of the neck. The creature's had long arms that left three fingers touching the floor. The claws tapped at the floor from wide frog-like feet. They had no clothes on and no genitalia, leaving their blueish gray bodies fully exposed. \nCentered at the tear ducts were insect like pincers and below that was a grotesque excuse for a beak. Cracked pink material that resembled plastic, coned at the end with razor sharp edges that dripped silver ichor. \"Ugly sons a bitches.\" Boomer sneered as he drew his fist back and let it fly into a face closest to him. It burst all the way through and a splash of violet viscous flew, landing all over Leroy who was still laying down. \"Ack! This stuff tastes like fucking motor oil and cough syrup!\"\n\n Leroy gagged then rose to his feet and kicked one of the other aliens in the stomach. A loud crack echoed in the dimly lit room. The thing folded in half, landing on the floor with a weak thud. A blind fury took over Boomer and he let out a roar. The torrent of speed and agility did not match with his size as he decimated the remaining creatures. Leroy could only stand and watch the scene of savagery. \nOne of the aliens crawled towards a wall and waved its boney hand across a glowing red sensor. The room lit up with a blinking blue light and a whining tune started to reverberate through some kind of speaker system. \"Shit. Little bastard sounded the alarm!\" Leroy shouted as he ran towards the one who set the siren off. He stomped on its ugly head, a fountain of what could only be its brains flew up and hit Leroy in the face. When everything settled, there were demolished alien corpses and two hillbillies covered in filth. \"C'mon let's find a door and end these fuckers.\"\n\nThey made their way through countless doors after finding a way out of the original room. Sensor panels sat at the edge of every opening and required a fingerprint, so Boomer had ripped off one of the aliens arms and was lugging it around like a key. The walls of this place were a cold gray with yellow dotted lights at the ceiling that would occasionally blink blue to coincide with the alarm that was still going off. \"We gotta turn that shit off.\" Leroy panted as the two jogged down a corridor. The place seemed way bigger on the inside and the countless rooms had no sign to indicate what was inside. This prompted Boomer to change plans and use the severed arm to open every door until they found some kind of control center. The first three rooms seemed to be sleeping quarters equipped with weird pools of pink gel and walls of glass that had orange and green liquid bouncing inside. Like a giant lava lamp. The fourth room is where things got weird. It looked like an operating room. They're was a long gold table with a contraption that could put any torture device to shame. An octagon shaped barrel was at one end and filled with organs. Whether they were animal or human, neither man could tell.\n\nAfter scavenging through a few other rooms and finding nothing, they turned a corner to see glass windows stretching on each side. Experiments were going on. On one end there was a man being held down with straps and one of the little monsters had a hold of his manhood. It was shoving some cylindrical object inside and the men realized why Mr. Smolpekir had an issue with his own private parts. Another room had two cats being grafted together, opposite of that was some hulking mass of purple tentacles that was spewing black slime covered eggs and a large man being force fed the disgusting things. His stomach pulsated and before long, miniature versions of that creature bursted out of the man's gullet. Spraying blood, puss and organs against the window. \nAs the two men approached a door leading to one of these areas, they paused with recognition. Leroy spoke up. \"Is that Meth Head Marty?\" Boomer squinted his eyes and when he saw the man, they widened. \"Holy shit, it is.\" The poor junkie was being fileted alive by a strange device that emitted a bright blue beam.\n\n Smoke was rolling from the meat as his flesh was stripped away in thin layers. Another creature was using some suction device to remove his intestines, spilling them into a vacuumed sealed container. Boomer used the hand to open a door and made his way into that room. \"You sick motherfuckers.\" The creatures stopped what they were doing to look up at the heavy breathing monster of a man. He huffed and dropped the severed limb then pushed both fists towards them. Each one caving in the skull of the aliens. Ichor flew and screams of agony escaped from Meth Head Marty while Leroy tried to free him. By the time he got the straps loose, the junkie was dead. \"God damn. He was a worthless piece of shit but no one deserves to die like that.\" Boomer didn't even stop and continued through each room, slaying every blueish gray creature he could get his hands on. Leroy snatched up the severed arm from the floor just in case.\nThis was one of those rare occasions where anger had taken over Boomer completely and nothing was gonna stand in his way. They continued on through the ship, Leroy trying to either save some helpless person or creature while Boomer slaughtered their captors. Some areas felt like a zoo with animals that could only have come from places not of earth. Strange mutated hybrids from the tinkering of gene splicing and countless humans who had been dissected gruesomely or made into strange eldritch forms. It was sick and with each passing moment, Boomers' rage intensified. \n\nWhen there were no remaining survivors or rooms to barge into, the two men came upon a door that was different from all the others. It was larger and had dots with jagged lines staggered in an odd placement. \"This here's gotta be the main room, right?\" Leroy asked and all Boomer did was grunt and used his organic key to open the door. Inside there was a large display screen that showed rolling hills, littered with trees and the night sky above. In front were three more aliens who were clicking and chirping while rolling knobs and pulling rope lined levers that looked like they were made from jellyfish arms. They all turned and squawked when they saw Boomer, clicking their weird pincers together. He didn't hesitate to unleash his wrath while Leroy stood and watched. \"Goddamn. I think I'll just stand guard and let you have at it buddy. Shit.\" It was like watching a real life alien invaders video game. All Leroy needed was a beer and some popcorn. And maybe a lawn chair.\nHe stood there enjoying the spectle and then something grazed his shoulder. He looked behind him and a new alien stood in the doorway. This one was female judging from the slimmer features and the fact that when Leroy looked down, he was staring at cleavage. But it was a bit different than what he was used to. Yep. This creature had three boobs. He looked at the face which was not very appealing but looked better than Tammy the Tank. The eyes were black with white circles for pupils. The head was that same oval shape but there were no insectoid proboscis and on top of the head were what looked like tentacles for hair. The creature whistled at him then removed the silvery garment that had been covering the three bulges of its chest. Leroy's eyes looked down and his mouth opened. \"Good god almighty. Theyre fucking triplets!\" \n\nThe alien grabbed his hand and placed it on the middle breast and Leroy felt a tightness in his jeans. He started to drool and thought he would be breaking a record for the most exotic one night stand. But all of the sudden a loud hiss broke his trance and the tentacles shot towards him, wrapping around his neck. They tightened and a long pair of jagged fangs protruded out of the slit which was centered near the base of the things neck. They snapped at him and sliced the side of his face. He tried to scream but couldn't. \nAs Boomer was in the middle of smashing one of the alien's skulls into the display screen, he heard gurgling from behind him. The limp gray body dropped from the large man's hand and he saw Leroy's situation. He hopped over the control panel and bum rushed his friend's attacker. It shrieked and released Leroy. As he coughed and gasped for air, Boomer released a flurry of punches and kicks. He gripped the writhing tentacles and pummeled the things face, leaving it disfigured. When it fell to the floor, he yelled and stomped it flat. Leroy finally got up and placed his hand on Boomer's shoulder. \"I think the bitch is dead, Rambo.\" Boomer turned around, drawing his fist back but stopped when he saw the fear in Leroy's eyes. He slumped his shoulders and hugged Leroy in apology. \n\nThe two men tried to figure out what to do next. They pushed buttons, slammed things and Leroy tried pulling on the odd jelly strings. They didn't know what the hell they were doing. Looking at the display screen, it seemed like the craft was standing still. Judging from the landscape, they thought it seemed familiar. Sure enough, the craft was near the woods behind their favorite bar. Well no longer favorite thanks to Leroy and his antics with Tammy the Tank. If they could land the craft, it wouldn't be a far distance from home. After all, Tilting Tim's Toxic Tavern was only a thirty minute drive from Leroy's. \n\nThey failed to figure out how to land the thing and Boomer punched one of the panels. \"Fucking piece of shit! We gotta get down.\" Leroy stood there and tapped the tip of his nose in consideration. \"Welp. When in doubt, piss on it.\" Boomer looked at him in confusion. \"Huh?\" Without answering, Leroy walked to the console area, unzipped his fly and began to release his bladder all over the lights and doo hickey's. Soon the contraption was fizzing and popping as if yelling in disgust. Sparks flew and smoke started to roll. The alarm finally ceased and the small lights on the ceiling faded in and out. A new sound filled the air, a low humming and sizzling sound. A jolt of gravity pulling the ship down hit them and the thing started to fall. Not a gradual descent but a full on drop. With nothing to grab on to, the men accepted fate as they were forced up towards the ceiling. \n\nTwo minutes later and there was a large crash. The display screen was black, the control panel was off and all that there were to see was low dimly lit bulbs above. It took some time but eventually Boomer and Leroy made their way back to the room they first arrived in. They fiddled with gadgets and eventually a small hole opened up and they climbed out. They trudged through woods and mounds of dirt, eventually emerging at the parking lot of the bar. The metallic saucer had crashed a mere ten yards away. A large stack of smoke bellowed from one end and occasionally sparks of electricity illuminated the slightly crumpled object.\n\nThe men stood back and rested against the wall of the bar, catching their breath. Boomer looked over at Leroy. \"Wanna get a beer?\" Leroy put in a wad of skoal, spit and faced his friend. \"You damn right. I ain't got my wallet so you're buying.\" Boomer chuckled and slapped Leroy's back. \"You cheap little bastard.\n\nAn hour later the men clambered out of the bar with the keys to Tammy the Tanks Volkswagen Beetle. During the hour inside, the men decided they needed to blow up the ship. Leroy claimed he had explosives at home which surprised Boomer. Being that it was such a distance to get to Leroys, he had to take one for the team and have a second round filling the bartender's mouth. After that they drove to Leroy's. Upon arrival, Leroy told Boomer to wait in the car. He came out a few moments later with a white bottle and two plastic bags. \"Alright let's get to stepping Buckaroo Ballsack.\" Boomer left the car in park and stared at the bags. \"What the hell is that? I thought you said you had explosives?\" The look of pride disappeared from Leroy's face. \"This is explosive.\" He pulled out a bunch of empty two liter bottles, a roll of aluminum foil and the white bottle was a container of toilet bowl cleaner. \"What the fuck are you gonna do with that?\" This turned into a screaming match that lasted a while until finally they both said \"fuck it\" and would try Leroy's dumbass plan.\nThey got halfway to the bar and completely forgot to bring another vehicle and turned around. Leroy cussing the whole time. After regrouping and having Boomer lead in Tammy the Tank's car, they set off in a two car caravan towards their destination. They pulled up and got out of the cars. Leroy proudly totting his \"explosives\". Boomer just stood there smoking his cigarette. \"So how is that shit gonna blow up this aircraft?\" Disbelief filled Leroy's eyes. \"You mean you never made a toilet bomb before?\" \n\nA moment of silence stood in for a negative answer. \"Shit man, my cousin and me used to make these all the time when we were knee high to a June bug.\" He explained to Boomer how to make them. We will refrain from those details here because there will be no lawsuits from any readers who decide to try this shit out. Go fuck yourselves. \nWith the nine empty bottles of mountain dew now filled with the correct measurements, the two men walked towards the ship. Craft. Whatever the hell you wanna call it. It's a damn alien flying car. They trudged back through the rough path until they made it to the opening that was once their escape. They went inside and started shaking bottles and tossing them in specific areas. Allowing enough time to run out before the big finale. \n\nWhen the last bottle was thrown, they made their escape for a second time with the same amount of haste. They both sat on the hood of Leroy's car, leaving dents on the poor thing. Two beers were cracked open simultaneously and as they pulled from their cans, multiple thuds started to ricochet within the metal container in front of them. They were delayed with about thirty seconds in between explosions until the last one gave its two cents. After that, more smoke rolled off of a few holes that had formed from the redneck bombs. The smell of noxious fumes filled the air and sparks followed with green flames shot out of different areas of the strange object. The men clinked their cans together. They sat and enjoyed the show and then Boomer spoke. \"I gotta ask, who's better at gobblin your knob? Tammy the Tank or Mrs. Smolpekir?\" An enormous smile cracked the sides of his face while a hateful scowl took over Leroy's. \"Fuck you.\" Smoke rolled up towards the night sky as laughter filled the air below.\n\n"},"79":{"title":"Batter Jerad ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1gujmbk\/batter_jerad\/","flair":"Story","author":"countcountess","selftext":"\nOk so I wanted to talk about this thing that happened to me awhile back still kinda freaks me out. I'm a highschool baseball player. I mostly played pitcher. \n\nMy school, let's call it Grant, was pumped up about a football game coming up. Apparently they used to be more a baseball oriented school but something happened and the baseball club was shut down. They recently reinstated it and our first game was in a couple days. So while everyone was focused on that next football play. I was more nervous about the baseball game. If we lost the season they could have a reason to shut down the baseball club again.no point in keeping a doomed team right? This year was our only chance to get it back fully.\n\nSo I decided one night to practice with my pitching at the old baseball field.The metal on the fence was a little rusted but I heard we were getting it remodeled next year\u2026 if we made it next year. \n\nI started focusing on angling my wrist just right where the catcher would be. I was Relatively tall and scrawny so I was perfect for the role of pitcher compared to the others of my team.\n\n\nFirst couple of throws I was getting good velocity but I kept going. Too soon it was already dark out. I told myself if I couldn't find the ball after every throw I would quit for the night. My mom knew this game was important to me and said I could. \n\n\nThe mist of the night made the grass dewy and my hands slippery. This last throw slipped from my hands behind me.\n\n As I picked the ball up I noticed someone sitting on the bleachers, a boy about my age, coffee colored skin with dreads and a baseball cap. He also had our white jersey on but had red mud on it. A baseball bat in between his feet. His eyes were a piercing white. I couldn't see the eye color because he was too far away. \n\nThe lamp post  light next to him flickered.\n\n\u201cOH uh hey didn't see you there I was just getting some more practice in\u201d I didn't recognize him but maybe because we had such a big team. \n\nHe didn't say anything.\n\n\u201cOk then\u2026 you're welcome to watch, I guess.\u201d I say. an eerie feeling crawling in my spine.is it racist to be creeped out? No no some of my friends are black and they don't give me the heebie jeebies like this. Maybe I'm stereotyping?not all black people are saints either being human and all.\n\nI throw another ball at the rusted fence. At the corner of my eye I see him standing at the tall fence with his bat on his shoulder. \n\n\u201cYou-\u201d my voice cracked, \u201cyou want to be my batter?\u201d I said \n\nHe nods.\n \n\u201cOk yeah we can do that\u201d my unease subsided a little. \n\nHe opens the gate door and walks over to the base. gets ready to swing. \n\u201cUm hey you got some red mud on your bat don't you want to um.. wash it?\u201d \n\nIt's gotta be red mud. I thought the idea of it being anything else was too ludicrous of an idea. Too.. concerning.\n\nWhen the guy doesn't move I say \u201cOk suit yourself\u201d wind up my pitch and throw. His bat hits the ball and it goes flying in the air. \n\n\u201cOH that was a good hit. I don't think I'll be able to find it.\u201d A feeling in my skin told me not to turn away from the batter \n\nSuddenly I felt the ball in my hand. I Jumped freaked out letting it go. The ball fell on the ground and rolled a little. I bent down to pick it up. I\u2026 I'm sure I threw it. \n\n\u201cI uh think I gotta go regardless.\u201d my feet wouldn't move. Something screamed at me that I had to throw another ball or I would die. That taking my eyes off him was a bad idea. \n\n\u201cOr I could do another pitch\u201d I get ready to do a screwball pitch. I thought if I can get him to turn around I can get free. He has to turn around to grab the ball when it gets thrown past him right?\n\nI put my middle and pointer finger at the top of the ball, putting my thumb on the bottom. I covered my grip with my other hand.\n\nIf I was going to trick him I would need to aim at his midsection. The screwball would then turn and hit away from where I aimed and he would miss the ball.\n\nI windup lifting my leg, extend my arm and throw.\n\nCRACK!\n\nSomething whizzed passed my face. was that the ball? How did he know I was throwing a screwball? how did he aim for my head as well. At this point I definitely knew something was off. But I had already been caught. I knew it in my gut.\n\nThe ball was in my hand again.\n\nAs I got ready to throw a fastball a thought crossed my mind. It was when we just were reinstating the baseball club. Sam was talking about some story of why the baseball club had been shut down. I didn't think much of it. but in this situation I really wished I had listened a little more.\n\nCRACK!\n\nThe ball whizzed at my face. I barely dodged my head, the ball hitting the tip of my nose. Feeling the leather felt much more\u2026 dangerous than just a normal ball more like a razer clipping me. the tip of my nose stung like a saw blade just went by.\n\n\u201cAgh\u201d I say startled and in pain. FUCK FUCK FUCK WHAT HAVE I GOTTEN MYSELF INTO! I thought. panicking a little.\n\nThe ball came back.\n\nI got ready for a curveball. It started raining. Great, just great.  \n\nHolding the ball close I lift my leg. A picture of the girl I liked crossed my mind. If I survived this I'll ask her out.\n\nI breathed deeply in and slowly out. Trying to calm myself. I can't throw if I'm not in the right headspace. And right now messing up didn't feel like an option. \n\nThe same Lamp post flickered on the bleachers. Everything but the rain and some birds could be heard. \n\nI windup the ball. My mom would miss me. Right?\n \nI extended my hand as I was in the crouched position I here my name \n\n\u201cJermy\u201d the ball slips from my fingers and I look to see Sam over by the fence \u201cyour mom told me to check on you it's past midnight dude\u201d\n\nI wip to look back at the batter noting I just fucked up. He was inches from my face, no irises just a white void. Blood splattered on his face.\n\n\u201cAHHH\u201d I scream and fall on my ass in the mud. And the batter disappeared. It wasn't raining anymore, the lights weren't flickering.\n\nI wasn't dead. I touched the tip of my nose, it was bleeding.\n\n\u201cYo man you ok?\u201dSam asked he didn't look like he had been rained on and didn't seem to be bothered.\n\n\u201cY-yeah\u201d I got up and left with him going home \n\nStill remember the cold chill of the rain.\n\n\nA couple weeks later I saw a picture of the last baseball club. That kid was in it. \n\n\u201cUh hey Sam you said there was a reason they shut down the  baseball club right? What was the story.\u201d\n \n\u201cOH yeah man it was gruesome some player named jerad went mad and killed the other team before the game\u201dhe said \u201cnever caught him\u201d he looks at me \u201cwhy do you ask?\u201d\n"},"80":{"title":"sono morto troppe volte giocando a dark soul","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1gtomrx\/sono_morto_troppe_volte_giocando_a_dark_soul\/","flair":"Story","author":"Complete-Succotash19","selftext":"Ho acquistato Dark Souls quasi per caso, senza un motivo preciso, forse era solo curiosit\u00e0. Qualcuno me ne aveva parlato come di un capolavoro, un\u2019esperienza unica capace di metterti alla prova non solo come giocatore, ma come essere umano. Non ci credevo \"Alla fine \u00e8 solo un videogioco\", mi dissi, mentre inserivo il disco nella console e mi sedevo sul divano con a fianco una lattina di energy drink.\nAppena avviato, provai un\u2019insolita felicit\u00e0 nel notare la possibilit\u00e0 di creare il proprio personaggio. Mi persi nei dettagli, conoscevo le basi di Dungeons & Dragons, quindi scelsi con cura ogni aspetto: statistiche, classe, persino il volto. Alla fine, optai per lo stregone. \"Un po\u2019 di intelligenza in pi\u00f9 non potr\u00e0 che farmi comodo\", pensai con un sorriso.\nSin dai primi momenti, il gioco aveva qualcosa di magnetico, quel mondo grigio, crudele, segnato dalla desolazione, mi attirava e respingeva allo stesso tempo. Ogni passo sembrava carico di un peso indefinibile, ogni angolo buio nascondeva un pericolo. La morte del mio personaggio era una costante, non era un fallimento, per\u00f2, almeno cos\u00ec mi dicevo. Ogni volta che cadevo, imparavo qualcosa: un nuovo attacco da prevedere, una trappola da evitare, un nemico da temere. I non morti erano ovunque e a volte mi sentivo sopraffatto, che poi il fatto che nessuno gli chiamasse zombie mi turbava profondamente.\nIniziai a chiedermi se tutto ci\u00f2 avesse un senso pi\u00f9 profondo, se ci fosse un messaggio nascosto dietro quella difficolt\u00e0 spietata. Forse ero io a volerlo vedere,forse ero io troppo scarso o forse era il gioco stesso a insinuarlo. Ero determinato ad andare avanti, nonostante continuassi a combattere con l\u2019elsa di una spada rotta, un\u2019arma che sembrava quasi schernirmi.\n\"Devo solo prenderci la mano,\" mi dissi, anche se dentro di me sentivo che c\u2019era qualcosa di pi\u00f9. Un\u2019ombra si allungava su quel mondo, e cominciava a insinuarsi anche dentro di me.\nE poi...poi iniziarono le stranezze. Era una sera tardi, intorno alle due del mattino. Stavo cercando di superare il Demone del rifugio per la ventesima volta, quando notai un messaggio sul pavimento, uno di quelli che ti consigliano che tasto premere. Solo che questo messaggio non era come gli altri. Diceva: \u201c\u00c8 il primo boss e hai gi\u00e0 perso 20 volte?\u201d\nRabbrividii. Non era possibile. I messaggi non potevano essere cos\u00ec specifici, come pu\u00f2 saperlo? Li ignorai e continuai a giocare, ma ogni volta che morivo, compariva un nuovo messaggio:\u201cOra sono ventuno.\u201d\u201cVentidue.\u201d Pi\u00f9 morivo, pi\u00f9 i messaggi si facevano personali. \n\u201cTi ricordi quando hai smesso di credere in Dio?\u201d\n\nMi fermai. Stavo leggendo correttamente? Provai a fare una foto, ma il messaggio svan\u00ec. Al suo posto ne apparve un altro: \u201cNon serve catturare prove. Lo sai gi\u00e0 che \u00e8 tutto vero.\u201d\nSpensi la play, mi dissi che era solo stanchezza e frustrazione; effettivamente perdere cos\u00ec tante volte al primo boss era abbastanza assurdo. \nMa il giorno dopo, qualcosa mi attir\u00f2 di nuovo alla play. Non era solo il desiderio di progredire: sentivo un bisogno quasi fisico di tornare a quel mondo.  \n\nRicominciai dal punto in cui avevo lasciato. Questa volta superai il Demone del Rifugio. Non so come ci riuscii, sembrava che i miei movimenti non li stessi controllando io. Era come se qualcosa stesse guidando la mia mano, costringendomi a eseguire le mosse giuste. Quando il Demone cadde, lasciai cadere il controller e rimasi a fissare lo schermo.\n\nUn messaggio comparve: \u201cHai preso gusto nel vincere, vero?\u201d\n\nMi ero informato, era impossibile che io vedessi quel messaggio, il tutorial era gi\u00e0 finito e non poteva essere stato lasciato da qualche altro giocatore, non ho la versione online del gioco, anzi non possiedo neanche l\u2019abbonamento plus della play. \n\nDa quel momento, il mondo di Dark Souls cambi\u00f2. Alcuni nemici sembravano riconoscermi. Non combattevano subito, mi osservavano da lontano come se stessero aspettando che facessi la prima mossa. \n\nPoi, al centro di un corridoio, trovai un altro messaggio: \u201cTi ricordi del tuo incidente in bicicletta?\u201d\n\nMi paralizzai. Nessuno poteva saperlo. Era una cosa che non raccontavo mai a nessuno, nemmeno agli amici pi\u00f9 intimi. Mi alzai, convinto di spegnere tutto, ma non ci riuscii. Le mie mani tornarono al controller quasi per istinto. Continuai a giocare, non perch\u00e9 volessi, ma perch\u00e9 dovevo. E, in fondo, sapevo che il gioco non era pi\u00f9 solo un gioco. Era una porta.\n\nMa non sapevo se stavo entrando o cercando disperatamente di uscire.\n\nI giorni successivi furono un tormento. Non riuscivo a smettere di pensare a Dark Souls. Mi svegliavo con la sensazione di aver sognato quel mondo: i corridoi stretti, le torce fioche, i non morti che strisciavano fuori dall\u2019oscurit\u00e0. Ma non erano sogni. Erano ricordi. \n\nOgni volta che accendevo la console, il gioco sembrava un passo avanti rispetto a me. I messaggi diventavano sempre pi\u00f9 personali, pi\u00f9 incisivi, scavando nei miei segreti pi\u00f9 profondi. Una sera trovai scritto: \u201cSai perch\u00e9 hai scelto lo stregone? Perch\u00e9 speri di essere intelligente, ma non lo sei.\u201d\n\nRimasi senza fiato. Quelle parole erano crude, ma colpivano un nervo scoperto, un dubbio che avevo sempre avuto e che mi sforzavo di ignorare. Era come se il gioco mi conoscesse meglio di quanto io conoscessi me stesso.\n\nDecisi di disinstallarlo. Mi ripetevo che non era altro che un bug, un sistema corrotto, magari una copia contraffatta del gioco. Ma quando provai a cancellarlo, la console si blocc\u00f2. Sullo schermo comparve un messaggio: \u201cNon puoi cancellare ci\u00f2 che hai accettato. Hai gi\u00e0 aperto la porta.\u201d\n\nSpensi la console e andai a dormire. Ma quella notte fu peggiore di tutte le altre. Sognai di essere nel gioco, con addosso la mia armatura da stregone. Ero circondato da nemici, ma non combattevano. Mi fissavano. Sussurravano. Il loro mormorio mi entrava nella testa, un brusio incomprensibile che si mescolava ai miei pensieri. A un certo punto, uno di loro si avvicin\u00f2 e parl\u00f2 con una voce che riconobbi: era la mia.\n\u201cTu sai di essere gi\u00e0 morto, vero?\u201d\n\nMi svegliai e mi portai la mano sul petto, mi alzai e presi un bicchiere d\u2019acqua, ma vidi una luce in salotto, la play era accesa, sullo schermo c\u2019era il mio personaggio che mi fissava.\nLa curiosit\u00e0 mi costrinse a prendere di nuovo il controller. Dovevo capire. Dovevo sapere. Appena ripresi a giocare, per\u00f2, tutto era diverso. Il mio personaggio sembrava muoversi da solo, come se seguisse un copione.\n\nMi trovai in una caverna buia. Non c\u2019era musica, solo il suono dei miei passi e un respiro pesante, distante ma incombente. Mi inoltrai nell\u2019oscurit\u00e0 finch\u00e9 non vidi una figura seduta su una sedia di pietra. Quando mi avvicinai, riconobbi il volto.\n\nEro io. \n\nIl personaggio alz\u00f2 lo sguardo e parl\u00f2: \u201cNon puoi fuggire da te stesso. Ogni morte \u00e8 una parte di te che lasci qui. Quante volte sei morto? Quante volte morirai ancora?\u201d\n\nNon sapevo cosa rispondere. L\u2019unica opzione che il gioco mi dava era attaccare. Provai a farlo, ma ogni colpo sembrava rimbalzare, come quando provi ad uccidere un NPC. \n\nPoi, sullo schermo, apparve un messaggio: \u201cStai lasciando che il gioco ti domini, ma il gioco non \u00e8 mai stato la vera prigione.\u201d\n\nNon capivo. O forse s\u00ec, ma non volevo accettarlo. Il controller inizi\u00f2 a vibrare, sempre pi\u00f9 forte, fino a sfuggirmi di mano. La console si spense da sola. Rimasi seduto nel silenzio, incapace di muovermi, con un\u2019unica certezza: non ero pi\u00f9 sicuro di dove finisse il gioco e dove cominciassi io.\n\nEro intrappolato, ma non nel mondo di Dark Souls. La vera gabbia era dentro di me.\nIl silenzio nella stanza era totale, opprimente. Rimasi a fissare lo schermo spento, cercando di convincermi che fosse tutto un\u2019illusione, un gioco troppo immersivo che aveva giocato con la mia mente. Eppure, non riuscivo a scrollarmi di dosso quella sensazione. Qualcosa era cambiato, e lo sentivo nella pelle, nelle ossa.\n\nLa console rimase spenta per giorni. Evitai di entrare in salotto, come se la presenza della playstation fosse un monito, un guardiano silenzioso che attendeva il mio ritorno. Cercai di distrarmi: lavoro, amici, serie TV. Ma ogni notte, quando chiudevo gli occhi, sognavo. Sognavo quel mondo, quei corridoi, quei nemici silenziosi che mi fissavano. E sognavo me stesso, seduto su quel trono di pietra, con quegli occhi vuoti.\n\nUna notte, non riuscendo a sopportare oltre, accesi la console. Non era una scelta: era un bisogno. Lo schermo si accese senza logo, senza introduzioni. Mi trovai immediatamente nel gioco, ma qualcosa era diverso. Non c\u2019erano pi\u00f9 nemici, non c\u2019erano messaggi. Solo un vasto deserto grigio, e davanti a me una torre, alta e sottile, che sembrava toccare il cielo.\n\nMi mossi verso di essa, le mani tremanti sul controller. Non era io a volerlo, o almeno cos\u00ec mi dicevo. Quando raggiunsi la base della torre, una porta si apr\u00ec da sola. Entrai. All\u2019interno c\u2019era solo una scala a chiocciola che si perdeva nell\u2019oscurit\u00e0. La percorsi, i passi del mio personaggio rimbombavano come tamburi nelle mie orecchie.\n\nQuando arrivai in cima, c\u2019era di nuovo quella figura: me stesso. Era seduto su un altro trono, ma questa volta aveva un\u2019armatura completa, scintillante come se fosse fatta di luce. Mi fiss\u00f2, poi parl\u00f2 con la mia voce, profonda e priva di emozioni:\n\u201cHai capito, ora? Ogni morte \u00e8 stata una parte di te che hai lasciato andare. Ogni volta che sei caduto, hai perso qualcosa: un ricordo, un rimpianto, una speranza. Questo \u00e8 ci\u00f2 che sei diventato. Un\u2019anima svuotata.\u201d\n\nTentai di muovermi, di reagire, ma il mio personaggio rimase immobile. La mia copia alz\u00f2 una mano, e il mio controller inizi\u00f2 a vibrare violentemente. Sullo schermo apparve un messaggio: \u201cVuoi tornare indietro?\u201d\n\nDue opzioni: \u201cS\u00ec\u201d o \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nIl sudore mi scorreva lungo la schiena. Provai a premere \u201cS\u00ec\u201d, ma il cursore non si mosse. Solo \u201cNo\u201d sembrava attivo. Con il cuore che batteva all\u2019impazzata, scelsi l\u2019unica opzione disponibile.\n\n\u201cAllora prendi il mio posto,\u201d disse la figura. Poi svan\u00ec, lasciando solo il trono vuoto. Il mio personaggio si mosse da solo, come se fosse guidato da una forza invisibile. Si sedette sul trono.\n\nIl mondo attorno inizi\u00f2 a crollare, le pareti della torre si sgretolavano, rivelando un vuoto nero. L\u2019ultima cosa che vidi sullo schermo fu il mio personaggio, immobile sul trono, e un messaggio che apparve al centro:\n\n\u201cLa tua partita \u00e8 finita. Grazie per aver giocato.\u201d\n\nLo schermo divenne nero. La console si spense.\n\nMi alzai tremante, ma qualcosa non andava. Quando mi guardai attorno, la stanza non era pi\u00f9 la mia. Le pareti erano grigie, spoglie. Al centro del salotto c\u2019era un trono di pietra, identico a quello del gioco. Mi avvicinai lentamente e toccai la pietra fredda. Quando lo feci, una voce risuon\u00f2 nella mia testa: \u201cBenvenuto a casa.\u201d\n\nCapii. Non ero pi\u00f9 nel mio mondo. O forse non lo ero mai stato davvero. Dark Souls non era mai stato solo un gioco. Era un portale, un percorso verso qualcosa che non avevo mai compreso.\n\nOra sono qui, seduto su questo trono, e aspetto. Non so cosa aspetto, ma so che verr\u00e0. E forse, quando accadr\u00e0, anche tu sentirai quella voce che ti chiama. Forse anche tu accenderai la tua console.\n\nE allora ci incontreremo.\n"},"81":{"title":"i died too many times on dark souls (english edition)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1gtoua7\/i_died_too_many_times_on_dark_souls_english\/","flair":"Story","author":"Complete-Succotash19","selftext":"I bought Dark Souls almost by accident, without any particular reason perhaps just out of curiosity. Someone had told me it was a masterpiece, a unique experience that tests you not just as a gamer but as a human being. I didn\u2019t believe it. \u201cIt\u2019s just a video game,\u201d I told myself as I inserted the disc into the console and sat on the couch with a can of energy drink by my side.  \n\nFrom the very start, I felt a strange happiness when I saw the option to create my own character. I got lost in the details. Knowing a bit about Dungeons & Dragons, I carefully chose every aspect: stats, class, even the face. In the end, I went with the sorcerer. \u201cA little extra intelligence can\u2019t hurt,\u201d I thought with a smirk.  \n\nFrom the very first moments, the game had something magnetic about it. That gray, cruel world, marked by desolation, both attracted and repelled me. Every step felt heavy, every dark corner held potential danger. My character's death was a constant not a failure, though, or so I told myself. Every time I fell, I learned something: a new attack to anticipate, a trap to avoid, an enemy to fear. The undead were everywhere, and at times I felt overwhelmed though I was strangely unsettled by the fact that no one called them zombies.  \n\nI began to wonder if all this had a deeper meaning, if there was some hidden message behind the merciless difficulty. Maybe I just wanted to see one. Maybe I was just bad at the game. Or maybe the game itself was insinuating it. I was determined to press on, even though I was still fighting with the hilt of a broken sword an almost mocking weapon.  \n\n\u201cI just need to get the hang of it,\u201d I told myself, though deep down, I felt there was something more. A shadow loomed over that world, and it was starting to creep into me as well.  \n\nAnd then... the strangeness began.  \n\nIt was late at night, around two in the morning. I was trying to beat the Asylum Demon for the twentieth time when I noticed a message on the floor, one of those that tells you what button to press. But this message was different. It said: \u201cIt\u2019s the first boss, and you\u2019ve already lost 20 times?\u201d\n\nI shivered. That couldn\u2019t be possible. Messages couldn\u2019t be that specific. How could it know? I ignored it and kept playing, but every time I died, a new message appeared:  \n\u201cNow it\u2019s twenty-one.\u201d\n\u201cTwenty-two.\u201d\n\nThe more I died, the more personal the messages became.  \n\u201cDo you remember when you stopped believing in God?\u201d\n\nI froze. Was I reading that correctly? I tried to take a picture, but the message disappeared. In its place, a new one appeared:  \n\u201cNo need to capture proof. You already know it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nI turned off the PlayStation, telling myself it was just exhaustion and frustration. After all, losing so many times to the first boss was absurd. But the next day, something pulled me back to the game. It wasn\u2019t just the desire to progress; it was a physical need to return to that world.  \n\nI picked up where I\u2019d left off. This time, I beat the Asylum Demon. I don\u2019t know how I did it it felt as if I wasn\u2019t even controlling my movements. Something seemed to guide my hand, forcing me to make the right moves. When the demon fell, I dropped the controller and stared at the screen.  \n\nA message appeared:  \n\u201cYou\u2019ve started to enjoy winning, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nI had checked: it was impossible for me to see such a message. The tutorial was already over, and it couldn\u2019t have been left by another player\u2014I didn\u2019t have the online version of the game. In fact, I didn\u2019t even have a PlayStation Plus subscription.  \n\nFrom that moment on, the world of Dark Souls changed. Some enemies seemed to recognize me. They didn\u2019t attack immediately; they watched me from a distance, as if waiting for me to make the first move.  \n\nThen, in the middle of a corridor, I found another message:  \n\u201cDo you remember your bike accident?\u201d\n\nI froze. No one could know that. It was something I never told anyone, not even my closest friends. I stood up, intending to turn everything off, but I couldn\u2019t. My hands returned to the controller almost instinctively. I kept playing, not because I wanted to, but because I had to. And deep down, I knew the game was no longer just a game. It was a door.  \n\nBut I didn\u2019t know if I was entering or desperately trying to escape.  \n\nThe following days were torment. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Dark Souls. I woke up with the feeling that I\u2019d dreamed of that world: the narrow corridors, the dim torches, the undead crawling out of the shadows. But they weren\u2019t dreams. They were memories.  \n\nEvery time I turned on the console, the game seemed one step ahead of me. The messages became increasingly personal, sharper, delving into my deepest secrets. One evening, I found one that read:  \n\u201cDo you know why you chose the sorcerer? Because you hope to be intelligent, but you\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nI was stunned. The words were brutal, but they struck a nerve\u2014a doubt I\u2019d always had but tried to ignore. It was as if the game knew me better than I knew myself.  \n\nI decided to uninstall it. I kept telling myself it was just a bug, a corrupted system, maybe even a counterfeit copy of the game. But when I tried to delete it, the console froze. A message appeared on the screen:  \n\u201cYou can\u2019t delete what you\u2019ve accepted. You\u2019ve already opened the door.\u201d\n\nI turned off the console and went to bed. But that night was the worst of all. I dreamed I was in the game, wearing my sorcerer\u2019s armor. I was surrounded by enemies, but they didn\u2019t attack. They just stared at me. Whispering. Their murmurs seeped into my head, blending with my thoughts. Eventually, one of them stepped forward and spoke in a voice I recognized: my own.  \n\u201cYou know you\u2019re already dead, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nI woke up and clutched my chest. I got up to get a glass of water, but I noticed a light in the living room. The PlayStation was on. On the screen, my character was staring back at me.  \n\nCuriosity compelled me to pick up the controller again. I had to understand. I had to know. But as soon as I started playing, everything was different. My character seemed to move on its own, following a script.  \n\nI found myself in a dark cave. There was no music, only the sound of my footsteps and a heavy breathing in the distance. I ventured deeper into the darkness until I saw a figure sitting on a stone chair. As I got closer, I recognized the face.  \n\nIt was me.  \n\nThe character looked up and spoke:  \n\u201cYou can\u2019t escape yourself. Every death is a part of you left behind. How many times have you died? How many more will you die?\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t know how to respond. The only option the game gave me was to attack. I tried, but every strike seemed to bounce off, as if I were trying to kill an NPC.  \n\nThen a message appeared on the screen:  \n\u201cYou\u2019re letting the game control you, but the game was never the real prison.\u201d \n\nI didn\u2019t understand or maybe I did, but I didn\u2019t want to accept it. The controller began to vibrate more and more violently until it slipped from my hands. The console turned itself off. I sat there in silence, unable to move, with one certainty: I no longer knew where the game ended and I began.  \n\nI was trapped. But not in the world of Dark Souls. The real prison was inside me.  \nThe silence in the room was total, oppressive. I sat staring at the blank screen, trying to convince myself it was all an illusion\u2014a game too immersive that had messed with my mind. Yet I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that something had changed. I felt it in my skin, in my bones.\n\nThe console stayed off for days. I avoided going into the living room, as if the presence of the PlayStation were a warning, a silent guardian waiting for my return. I tried to distract myself: work, friends, TV shows. But every night, when I closed my eyes, I dreamed. I dreamed of that world, those corridors, those silent enemies staring at me. And I dreamed of myself, sitting on that stone throne, with those hollow eyes.\n\nOne night, unable to take it any longer, I turned the console back on. It wasn\u2019t a choice it was a need. The screen turned on without a logo, without introductions. I was immediately in the game, but something was different. There were no enemies, no messages. Only a vast gray desert, and in front of me, a tower tall and thin, stretching into the sky.\n\nI moved toward it, my hands trembling on the controller. It wasn\u2019t me who wanted this or so I told myself. When I reached the base of the tower, a door opened on its own. I stepped inside. Within was only a spiral staircase disappearing into darkness. I climbed it, my character's footsteps echoing like drums in my ears.\n\nWhen I reached the top, that figure was there again: me. They were sitting on another throne, but this time wearing full armor, gleaming as if made of light. They looked at me and spoke with my voice, deep and emotionless:\n\u201cDo you understand now? Every death was a piece of yourself left behind. Each time you fell, you lost something: a memory, a regret, a hope. This is what you\u2019ve become. A hollow soul.\u201d\n\nI tried to move, to react, but my character stayed still. My double raised a hand, and the controller began vibrating violently. A message appeared on the screen:\n\u201cDo you want to go back?\u201d\n\nTwo options: \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nSweat dripped down my back. I tried to press \u201cYes,\u201d but the cursor wouldn\u2019t move. Only \u201cNo\u201d was active. With my heart pounding, I chose the only option available.\n\n\u201cThen take my place,\u201d the figure said. Then they disappeared, leaving only the empty throne. My character moved on their own, as if guided by an invisible force. They sat on the throne.\n\nThe world around me began to collapse. The tower\u2019s walls crumbled, revealing a black void. The last thing I saw on the screen was my character, motionless on the throne, and a message that appeared in the center:\n\n\u201cYour game is over. Thank you for playing.\u201d\n\nThe screen went black. The console turned off.\n\nI stood up, trembling, but something was wrong. When I looked around, the room was no longer mine. The walls were gray, bare. At the center of the living room was a stone throne, identical to the one in the game. I approached it slowly and touched the cold stone. When I did, a voice echoed in my head:\n\u201cWelcome home.\u201d\n\nI understood. I wasn\u2019t in my world anymore. Or maybe I never had been. Dark Souls was never just a game. It was a portal, a path to something I had never comprehended.\n\nNow I\u2019m here, sitting on this throne, waiting. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m waiting for, but I know it\u2019s coming. And maybe, when it does, you\u2019ll hear that voice calling you too. Maybe you\u2019ll turn on your console.\n\nAnd then, we\u2019ll meet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"82":{"title":"Tunnels","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1gt2rf7\/tunnels\/","flair":"Story","author":"Canned_Noobz","selftext":"This was a while back i think back in 2021.

I was running late from work and I needed to get home asap as I promised my girlfriend of 3 years that I\u2019d be home in time to see the live premiere of her show or whatever. The point was that I was taking this new shortcut, one I always see but seemed ominous. Once, a man reported seeing eyes stalking him from with-in the ever growing darkness. But that didn\u2019t cross my mind at the time so I entered through the area, a mistake I came to soon regret.\u00a0\n\nIt was fine at first, the alley-way not living up to the mystery surrounding it nor the name given to it. That name was \u201cAlley of Shadow.\u201d I continued my fast paced walk, not paying much attention to my surroundings. That\u2019s when a sudden static noise bursted in, filling my ear-drums with this awful noise coming from somewhere I couldn\u2019t specify. It sounded like it was everywhere. The noise put me at a screeching halt as I looked around to see what this noise was though I found nothing.\u00a0\n\nWith that, I felt a little reassured that it was all in my mind even though the feeling didn't stick long. I continued my walk at the same pace when I tripped over something. I looked around the spot I tripped, not seeing what it possibly could\u2019ve been. I start to get back up when I see haunting white eyes from the shadow just stalking me. It doesn't move an inch at all as I jump up, starting to run from this thing though it seems to be following.\n\nI keep running, peeking behind me every so often and seeing the white eyes the same distance away from me. Every time I look ahead though, the alleyway seems to get longer and longer, like an endless hallway. I keep running, slowly tiring out but it feels like where I just was. It doesn\u2019t even look like I\u2019ve run halfway through this place even though my breath is heavy and husky, I keep trying to catch air until I can\u2019t run anymore and I just slide against the building to the cold ground.\n\nI look back into the ever-growing darkness to see the blank, white eyes still staring at me seemingly without any purpose. Its gaze feels empty and lifeless when it falls upon me. It moves closer as I try to get up to run again, trying to escape this thing. Each footstep causes a loud thudding sound which seems to disturb this creature mildly. The alley-way still seems to grow ever longer, without an escape nor an end to the alley.\n\nAfter a minute of running, I really can\u2019t run anymore no matter how hard, so my pace slows to a light jog. The creature gets closer though, its crooked, evil smile falling into my line of sight as it still stares with lifeless, emotionless eyes. I look forward again, everything swallowed in pitch-blackness. I close my eyes, jogging forward and hoping for the best and that I keep getting to live my life still.\n\n"},"84":{"title":"The Passenger (A story made by Kiara EBK.

Don\u2019t believe me? Well, this story will make you\u2026\n\nI\u2019m a taxi driver you see - always giving people lifts to where they need to go. After a long day it was now 3AM in the morning. And I know what you\u2019re thinking; \u20183AM? That\u2019s the devil\u2019s hour! Creepy things happen at that time!\u2019 And yes, I have heard of those rumors but I personally didn\u2019t believe them. Anyway\u2019s I was about to drive home when this strange man approached my car. He was wearing a grey hoodie that covered his face, concealing it in darkness. He was also wearing pants that looked old and torn like he got them years ago. He looked at me, (at least I think he did) for a good, long second and eventually said, \u2018Could I have a lift please?\u2019. I was a bit creeped out by the way he said it but I agreed. I mean, what could go wrong?\n\nI opened my car door and let him in. I asked him, \u2018Well then sir, where do you want to go at this ungodly hour?\u2019 Half-joking. He replied with an area I hadn\u2019t heared of since 1986! Pripyat! I was stunned and chuckled nervously to myself. \u2018You do know that place has been abandoned since 1986, right?\u2019 I said to the stranger. He didn\u2019t reply. Instead, he just chuckled to himself and then silently nodded. It was quite creepy to be honest. I then started driving to Pripyat but before long, I started to feel a bit scared. It felt like hours before we even left the city of Slavutych.\n\nAs we were on our way, I felt like he was staring at me, even though every time I look through my rear-view mirror, he was glancing out the window at the nearby passing buildings and cars. It was very uneasing. When we were just about to enter Pripyat, I all of a sudden felt a great pain in my chest - more pain than I have ever experienced in my entire life! However, when I look down to see my chest, there was nothing there. Before I knew it, i had fainted from the sheer pain. Everything after that was blurry until I awoke in the nearby hospital. However, I could\u2019ve sworn I heard the man whisper ever so faintly in my ear, \u2018You should\u2019ve just went home.\u2019 And right as those words hit my ears, I saw the image of his face; grey and covered with scars and eyes that looked like they were about to pop out of their sockets! And then, plastered on the lower half of his face, was an incredibly toothy grin that no human could ever make without their face being altered forever. It was a sight you could never unsee.\n\nApparently, my car crashed into a nearby abandoned shop and I had a piece of metal in my arm. I asked if the man in the passenger\u2019s seat was ok, but the nurses\u2018 faces said otherwise. Their faces turned pale and their eyes grew wide. Eventually, one of them mustered up the courage to say something that sent shivers down my spine, \u2018Sir, there was no one there.\u2019 They then handed me a note covered in what appears to be blood. \u2018The police found in one of the seats in the car. They say they weren\u2019t able to identify whose blood that is.\u2019 One side had a drawing of the man and the other side had an eerie message; \u2018Thank you for the ride, Haller.\u2019 That sentence made my face go as pale as their\u2019s. I never told him my name\u2026"},"85":{"title":"I drank ice tea then it came","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1gs7gkn\/i_drank_ice_tea_then_it_came\/","flair":"Story","author":"Snowscreams","selftext":"It was the summer of 2019 when I first encountered the strange iced tea. I was staying at my cousin\u2019s house in a small, forgotten town on the edge of nowhere. The air was thick with humidity, and the sun beat down mercilessly, leaving nothing to do but sit inside with the air conditioning running and a cold drink in hand. I remember it like it was yesterday: the glass of iced tea sitting on the counter, beckoning me.\n\nI had just arrived, and my cousin\u2014quiet, reserved, and a little strange\u2014had offered me the drink without a word. He\u2019d made it himself, he said, and I wasn\u2019t about to turn down something cold on such a scorching day. The amber liquid shimmered, perfectly clear with just the faintest hint of lemon floating on top. It was sweet, but not too sweet, refreshing in a way I couldn\u2019t quite place.\n\nIt was perfect.\n\nBut something\u2026 changed after that first sip. I felt my throat tighten, a strange, metallic taste creeping over my tongue, almost like the aftertaste of rust. I set the glass down, thinking nothing of it\u2014probably just my imagination\u2014but as the seconds ticked by, I began to notice something far more disturbing.\n\nThe glass wasn\u2019t empty.\n\nI\u2019d barely drunk half of it, yet the liquid inside the glass seemed to\u2026 refill. Slowly, imperceptibly, the iced tea level began to rise, as if an unseen hand was pouring more into the glass. I blinked, confused. My cousin wasn\u2019t paying attention. He was sitting across the room, absorbed in his own thoughts, his eyes distant. I lifted the glass to my lips again, hesitant, but the cool liquid was too tempting. I drank.\n\nThe sweet, metallic taste spread across my mouth once more. But this time, I didn\u2019t set the glass down.\n\nThe refilling continued. Each sip, each moment, the glass seemed to replenish, more and more until the entire thing was full again. The feeling in my chest grew colder, a creeping sensation running down my spine. The glass was now full to the brim\u2014too full, too heavy\u2014but I couldn\u2019t stop. I felt compelled to drink.\n\nI remember staring at the amber liquid swirling in the glass as I brought it to my lips again, the room growing darker around me. The walls seemed to pulse, breathing in and out in rhythm with my own ragged breaths. I couldn\u2019t look away from the drink. My reflection in the glass was wrong\u2014my eyes were hollow, sunken deep into my skull. But I was too thirsty.\n\nI drank and drank, the liquid never diminishing, always replenishing, as if the iced tea itself was alive, feeding on my desperation, feeding on my fear. Each swallow made my throat feel colder, my stomach emptier, until I could no longer feel anything but the overwhelming need to consume more. The sweetness turned sour, the chill turning to a biting cold that spread through my veins, numbing me from the inside out.\n\nI tried to scream, but my throat was too dry. My hands trembled as I clutched the glass, the ice now frozen solid, unyielding, the glass practically searing through my skin with an unnatural frost.\n\nMy cousin stood up from his chair, finally noticing my panicked state. He looked at me, expressionless.\n\n\u201cYou should have stopped drinking,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou should have stopped long ago.\u201d\n\nI tried to push the glass away, but it stuck to my hand like glue. The liquid was ice now\u2014no longer tea, but something darker, something wrong. The amber liquid had turned black as midnight, swirling with shadows, as if it had come from somewhere far deeper than the glass itself.\n\nI looked up at him, my vision blurring. His smile was wide, unsettling. I could feel my consciousness slipping away, each sip dragging me further into darkness.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never stop drinking,\u201d he whispered, the sound echoing in the room. \u201cOnce you start, it never ends.\u201d He said a creepy smile filling his usually calm face.\n\nI screamed, or at least I tried to, but no sound came. Suddenly I saw a dark smiling figure behind my cousin. I saw them talking but I could only hear the relentless sloshing of the tea as it refilled, again and again, like a never-ending nightmare. The last thing I remember was the cold\u2014so much cold\u2014and then nothing.\n"},"86":{"title":"Changing Lights PT.3","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1gs6w9m\/changing_lights_pt3\/","flair":"Story","author":"ZealousidealYam4891","selftext":"\nA low humming rattled the single pane windows of a rickety old house. Shimmering lights of color bled through the curtains inside. Two sets of snoring echoed from the bedroom. A whirring sound cascaded from the field and slowly crept into the house. Nocturnal animals skittered away in fear and agony from the frequency that pierced their fragile ears. The commotions from outside grew louder and louder. The shuffling of corn stalks being crushed added to the orchestra.\nThe continuous stir of noises disturbed the sleep of the old man inside of the house. Agitation flooded him as he opened his wrinkled eyes, crows feet stretched across a worn face. He spoke in a gravelly voice. \"What in God's name?\" Aches and pains struck every bone in his body during the act of rising from the bed. Ligaments burning, joints popping and sighs of anguish expelled from the man.\nHe fumbled for his boots, grumbling under his breath. \"Damn kids. They'll never learn will they?\" Skittering footsteps peddled towards the living room and veered right to a wooden case that housed a collection of firearms. Boxes of different types of ammunition were stocked in the lower shelving. He gripped a double barrel shotgun and a box of buckshot shells. \"Little bastards.\" With the gun loaded and ready to be fired, the old man hobbled his way to the front door.\n\"Off my property you punks!\" \n\nHe shouted to an audience that consisted of no living creature. All was quiet in the animal kingdom and there were no ruffians to be found. Instead there was a spiraling stream of purple mist falling towards his field. Drops of deep green followed with the mist. A pulsating beam of yellow light created a glimmer effect that made the colors of the two forms of liquid vibrant. The stalks of corn below were bowing and bending under the light. Shuffling sounds and pops surfaced from the field. These were not as profound as the humming and whirring that came from the object emitting the light that dispensed the colorful mist and rain. It slowly tilted to the left and right in a rocking motion. The act was allowing the shiny thing above to move gradually around the circumference of the field. Gradually covering every square foot of the half rotten crop.\n\nThe man's jaw dropped. The whole spectacle reflected itself off of his tired pupils. Urine slowly ran down his legs and soiled the loose undergarments and socks he wore, dripping down into his untied boots. His heart thumped and his arm started to tingle. \"My god.\" These were the only words he could speak before fighting the pain and raising his gun towards the strange metal monstrosity infecting his crops. A loud bang overpowered every other sound, fire erupted from the twin barrels. The buckshot made its way towards the craft and hit without any repercussions. The contents that left the shells disintegrated with a hiss and red smoke rolled off of the smooth gleaming metal.\n\nThe whirring ceased but the humming continued, growing so loud that the old man dropped his gun to cover his ears. The stream of mist abruptly stopped and the yellow light transitioned into a bright shade of green. A whistle filled the air and within seconds the giant object was hovering near the house. The beam of light shown on the man. He screamed. The scorching vibrance of the light was beyond worse than the daily pains he felt in his body. His agonizing wailing lasted long enough for his body to be jetted upwards then it was cut off. He was gone and the light returned to its original color. The whistling returned, bringing the mist and rain back over the field of corn.\nMoments later an old woman removed herself from the bed to search for her husband. She looked everywhere in the house but failed to find him. She put on slippers and headed outside. She stood out, calling his name but no response was given. Evidence of his presence was apparent with his abandoned boots, underwear and shotgun. \n\nShe looked at the items then beyond the porch and paused when her eyes saw the same spectacle her husband did above the field. She did not scream, only stood in awe. By this time, the deed was done. The light and liquid dispersed, a chime of whistling pierced the air and the object was gone. The woman collapsed on the porch, falling unconscious. \n\"Steven!\" The crackling yet feminine voice rang in Boomer's ears. The hangover had already set in with consciousness. \"Help!\" Another shattering wail from afar. Even though the yelling was not close to him, Boomer felt as if it was directly inside of his brain. \"Good god! Someone help me!\" With the third wail, Boomer said fuck it and sat up. He had fallen asleep on Leroy's tattered futon. Being too drunk to flatten the thing out, he slept uncomfortably on it while in the couch position. Something hard scraped against his leg and he let out a small yelp. \"Ow! The fuck?\" He looked over and the stray dog was sleeping beside him, kicking her three dog legs and one sheep leg. A sure sign she was dreaming about running and the new additional leg had assaulted Boomer. Apparently he snuck the dog into Leroy's trailer. \n\nTrying to avoid any drama with Leroy, Boomer picked the dog up and brought her outside. \"Sorry girl. Don't wanna deal with any fussin 'from dickhead.\" The dog, natively called Kalido, looked at the man with understanding eyes. He scratched behind her ears and walked back inside, the dog lazily stepped towards the woods as usual. The snoring from the other end of the trailer echoed fiercely. \"Jesus. Sounds like a damn freight train in here. No wonder Suzy Mae never stays over.\" With not a care in the world, Boomer kicked the bedroom door open, stomped towards the bed and smacked Leroy across the face. \"Black Mamba bitch!\" The sound of his open palm hitting Leroy's cheek bounced off of the thin walls.\n\n\"Shit! Damn it Boomer. Was that necessary? Fuckin' asshole!\" Leroy's voice cracked. He sat up, rubbing the now redden cheek. His friend just stood there looking at him and pointing towards the window. \"What?\" Leroy's previous fit of snoring overpowered everything so the cries for help never registered in his audio organs. Boomer said nothing and just waited, leaving his hand frozen in place. As Leroy was about to berate him, another shout came through. \"Steven! Where the hell are you?\" The voice was recognizable. It was Mrs. Smolpekir. She continued shouting while Leroy began getting dressed and filling his lip with moist tobacco. \n\n\"I swear, that woman better be decent.\" Leroy said as he begrudgingly walked with Boomer towards his neighbors home. This was only after Boomer had conned Leroy into going over with him to check out what the commotion was. Having a heart five times the normal size means the care spills out towards humans too. Boomer never had a weird experience with the old woman so there was no scarring on his part. And nonetheless, when someone was in need he had to help.\n \nThey got to the house and the woman continued shouting until she realized them standing there. \"Oh hello boys.\" A failed attempt at a smile stretched her lips. Leroy swallowed his disgust and spoke up. \"What's the problem? We heard you hollerin all the way at my place. You ok?\" Mrs. Smolpekir undid one of the buttons on her night gown to reveal extra skin. \"Oh Leonard. It's Steven, I can't find his ass anywhere. The man left his shit stained skivvies and boots on the porch. His dick don't work so I know he ain't out whorin'. Found his shotgun too so now I'm worried the ball buster is in trouble.\" Boomer had forgotten how foul mouthed the old lady was and chuckled under his breath. Leroy nudged him with his elbow and went back to the conversation. \"I'm sure he's fine ma'am. Do you need to call someone to help look for em? Maybe the cops?\" The woman's face turned into a scowl and she screamed from the bottom of her soul. \"Fuck the police!\" Birds flew away from tree tops and squirrels fell from branches by the sound of the banshee.\n\nBoomer let out a laugh he couldn't hold in. Leroy gave a glare and the noise was silenced. \"You want us to try and look for em? No boots or drawers, he can't have gone far?\" Mrs. Smolpekir nodded with a pleading look on her face and raised her hands towards Leroy. \"Would you please? I would appreciate it so fucking much.\" She started to move her fingers in a gesture to come closer. Boomer nudged Leroy. \"Go on, she needs ya up there.\" A shoving match broke out but eventually Leroy staggered up the steps towards the outstretched arms of the old woman.\n\nHe slumped towards her and she wrapped her arms around him. \"Such a sweet boy. Thank you for helping this old bitch.\" Her hands slowly made their way past Leroy's hips and she cupped his cheeks. Not the ones on his face but the other ones. His ass, she grabbed his ass. \"After you find that cocksucker, you come see me and I'll thank you properly. You can have Bummer join too if you like, I can handle two at a time.\" After mispronouncing Boomer's name, Mrs. Smolpekir's hands gave a squeeze and she licked Leroy's neck. It felt like sandpaper and all he smelled was fermented corn and moth balls. \"Oh. Uh. Yea. Maybe some other time. We're gonna head on out and look for your husband.\" Leroy broke away and leaped off the porch. He gripped Boomer's arm. \"Let's get the fuck outta here. Now.\"\n\nAfter the very unnerving and sexually assaulting interaction with Mrs. Smolpekir, the two men left to have breakfast at Sour Sassafras Saloon. The only place where you can order a stack of pancakes with a thick bacon syrup accompanied by a boilermaker. Hey, hair of the dog right? Leroy got pancakes, squirrel sausage and the house special drink. Boomer got two stacks of pancakes, a turkey fried steak and the mystery soup. Trust me, you wanna leave that shit a mystery.\nOn top of his giant heart and size, the man had an iron gut so he could handle it. Any other normal human being who ate the mystery soup, well let's just say it had close to the same effect as the world famous turkey chili dog at Chicken Cathedral. They ate and drank, Leroy pleading not to find the missing old man and avoiding any other interaction with the misses. Boomer teased him for a while but ultimately agreed. Leroy can be pretty convincing at times and on occasion his charming words would outweigh Boomer's need to do right by others. \n\nThey dropped their conversation to look at the tv mounted on the back wall to watch a breaking news bulletin. A reporter who resembled Mimi Bodeck from The Drew Carey show appeared with an overturned semi truck behind her. \"This is Sally Silicone with BBW69 news. Reporting here in Nutbug Falls on the wreck involving a large truck hauling pharmaceutical.....\" The men's attention focused on a man walking past the collision and Boomer spoke. \"Is that. Old man Smolpekir?\" Leroy squinted his eyes. \"You gotta be fuckin shittin' me. I reckon it is.\" \n\nBefore the grace of God, there was the old man. Walking around aimlessly. Sporting only a stained t-shirt. His lower half was exposed and at full salute. That's right, the man was Donald Ducking it with a hard on. The news crew didn't seem to notice him or just ignored him, either way the large woman covered in clown paint continued her report without pause. \"It seems like some poisonous substance has begun to leak from the tank, causing.....\" Her words went unnoticed. \"How you figure he got all the way out yonder?\" Leroy asked but Boomer had no answer. You see, Nutbug Falls settled on the outskirts of Saggysack County which was almost two and a half hours from the men's current location. I don't think it's been stated before, Boomer and Leroy live in Deepguzzle. There, now you know where they live. No you can't have either of their home addresses to send fan mail.\n\nWe will skip some of the boring traveling parts, but after a long discussion consisting of Leroy whining and Boomer's soft side winning the discussion, they went out to pick up Mr. Smolkpekir. Call it fate or sheer dumbass luck, they found the geezer after looking around Nutbug Falls within thirty minutes. He was leaning against a stop sign across from a place called The Swivel Snatch. You can take a guess of what sort of establishment it was. Unfortunately for the old man, it was too early in the day to visit, so he just stared at the female figure created from neon lights that were currently nothing but dull and unlit bulbs.\nThe men pulled up next to him and Leroy rolled the passenger window down. \"Hey there Mr. Smolpekir. Your wife's been lookin fir ya.\" The old man stared blankly for a while. It took almost five minutes before he finally reacted. \"Huh? Who the hell are you?\" A deep look of confusion settled in his eyes. He stared at Leroy again and began to itch his leg, only then realizing he had no pants on. \"Heh? Where's my pants? Where am I?\" Leroy lowered his head in annoyance. \"Yer'n Nutbug Falls. We was hopin' you'd tell us how ya got here.\" The old man looked down, meeting the gaze of a one eyed captain below. \"Why's it staring at me?\" He looked back at Leroy. \"Who are you?\"\n\nThe whole situation was annoying and both men were losing their patience. Leroy exhaled deeply. \"It's me sir, Leroy. I live next door. I used to work on your farm when I was younger.\" No recognition on Mr. Smolpekir's face. \"Leonard?\" Another exhale from the truck. \"No. LEROY.\" There was still that dumbstruck look on the wrinkled face. A long silence hung on for dear life in the humid air that smelled like vaseline and pork rinds. Then something clicked. \"Oh. Lemmy my boy! How are you?\" A third and final exhale. It was followed by a low mumbling of words that were barely audible. \"Jesus horny toad christ fuckin a bull during lent.\"\n\n This was accompanied by words the old man could actually hear. \"Yes sir, it's me. I'm OK. How 'bout we get you in the truck and take you home?\" The man nodded and fumbled to grab the door handle. Leroy looked over at his friend. \"Boomer. We're gonna need something to cover Stiffy's lower half.\"\nDuring the drive back to Deepguzzle, both men prodded at the old man to get information on how he managed to get so far from home. No luck came their way, only confusing looks and more questions than answers. Occasionally Mr. Smolpekir would grope his still erect extremity and Leroy would have to plead with him to put the thing away. Boomer found the whole thing amusing. But I'm sure if the old man was sitting next to him instead of Leroy, he wouldn't find it so funny.\nThey made it back to Smolpekir farm and Leroy convinced Boomer to escort the old man home. \"C'mon man. Please? I don't want that old bitch, I mean sweet woman trying to reward me.\" Leroy had to watch his words considering the woman's husband was in the truck. Boomer obliged and walked the old man home. Fifteen minutes passed before Boomer returned to the truck. He got in and his face was pale. \"What the hell took so long?\" Boomer refused to speak for a while. They drove in silence and it was getting on Leroy's nerves. \"God damnit. Will you say something already?\" Boomer stopped abruptly and put the truck in park. \"There's something wrong with that woman.\" Leroy chuckled at his friend's words, knowing he probably got a taste of Mrs. Smolpekir's carnal urges. \"Yea no shit Sherlock. What'd she do to ya?\" Boomer rubbed his eyes before answering. \"She thanked me and grabbed my.....my....\" Leroy let out a cheer of laughter. \"She touched your dingle dangle huh, big boy? Yea that sounds like her. She's a god damn pervert, man.\" Boomer didn't blink and started to add more of his experience. \"She tried kissing me with that horrible breath and unbuttoned her nightgown. All in front of the old man.\" The shocking details were new to Boomer but Leroy was not phased at all. \"See, now you understand what the fuck I mean when I saw she ain't no sweet lady. That's why she holds the record for the most restraining orders. I don't know why the old man stays married to her.\"\n\nBoomer continued talking about what happened and basically he could've reported sexual assault in the workplace if he was in an office setting. Mrs. Smolpekir described what she'd do to him and stripped, revealing her bare body right there. Gripped the saluting member of her husband and told Boomer to follow them to the bedroom. Not the situation he wanted to be put in so he ran out of the house without saying a word. Leroy felt better about himself now that his friend got a taste of what he once went through. The men made it back to Boomer's and Leroy had to go meet Suzy Mae for dinner but would be back later to drink beers in hopes that it would flush away the horrific sight that had burned Boomer's pretty blue eyes.\nLeroy arrived at Boomer's around nine o'clock. In the hours that passed, Boomer had cut the lawn, tended the animals, ate lunch and rescued a baby racoon that was almost attacked by a rabid coyote. Boomer growled at the coyote which in turn, shit itself and ran with its tail between its legs. \n\nThe two men met at the steps of the porch where Boomer had made a nice little bed for the infant procyonidae. That's the Latin term for the common racoon, folks. Leroy didn't even bother asking about the animal and instead removed two cans from the plastic rings of a six pack. He tossed one to his friend and cracked the other open for himself. \"So I saw Mr. Smolpekir fuckin around in his field on my way here. He had pants on, thank god. But anyway, some kids ruined his corn.\" Leroy chugged his beer after this statement. Boomer tucked the slumbering animal in for a nap then opened his beer. \"How'd they ruin it?\" Leroy looked at the fur bandit then answered. \"I don't know. Kinda looked like they flattened a bunch of spots in the field. The old man was cussin' and tryin to lift the stalks up. I didn't bother talkin to em though. His wife was outside topless, sunbathing. Oof.\" A sense of disgust and wonder came over Boomer. The wonder was for the crops, not Mrs. Smolpekir outside without a top you sick fucks. \"I'd rightly like to see that actually.\" Considering nothing exciting really happens around these parts, something like this spelled adventure. \"I thought you already saw the old lady's tatas?\" Boomer grimaced. \"No you dipshit, the corn field.\" Both men equipped themselves with a fresh beer and drained them to forget about the sight of Mrs. Smolpekir nude.\n\nOnce again Leroy's poor car was left behind, a tear shedding from a foggy headlight as the men departed. They parked near the giant dent on Leroy's trailer and got out. \"You're still an asshole for that.\" Leroy said as he pointed at the crumpled corner of his home. Sorry, mobile home. They saw old man Smolpekir out in his now flattened cornfield. The canine priestess formerly known as Kalido came running at the sight of Boomer. \"Hey pretty girl!\" She bolted towards the large man, leaving the depressed excuse for a field. He picked her up, indulging in the kisses and whines of sheer excitement. Her one sheep leg tapped his arm and accidentally scratched him. He sucked in air and pushed through the sharp pain. He put her back down and noticed purple dust at the bottom of her legs. \"Whatcha got on you girl?\" He examined the powdery substance, brushing it off and inspected the residue on his hand. It sent a sensation of needles on his skin. Like the feeling you get when a section of your body is asleep, that uncomfortable stinging that makes you move that body part as slow as possible.\n\nBoomer also noticed a faint smell coming from the dog. Not the normal odor associated with canines but something entirely different. It was a smell he had encountered before but at the moment he wasn't sure from where. He saw the dog had come from the disheveled corn field beyond. \"Let's go and see what's up with the old man's corn, Leroy.\" They got up there to see a field full of fallen stalks. They were bent over, intricately woven against one another. It formed a crochet type pattern almost. As Leroy struck up a conversation with Mr. Smolpekir, Boomer started scanning the oddly placed crops. \"What's goin' on sir?\" Leroy's voice startled the old man and he damn near hopped out of his boots. \"Jesus! You scared the shit out of me Lemmy!\" Once again the old man mispronounced the scrawny rednecks name. Not bothering to correct him, Leroy responded. \"Sorry 'bout that. What happened to your field?\" The old man scratched at his chin then hocked a loogie. \"God damn aliens is what.\" Boomers' ears perked up with that. He rubbed his hand against a disfigured stalk, noticing the same purple powder he found on the dog. He smeared it between his finger and thumb, it instantly gave the same tingling as before. And he noticed that the whole area had the same familiar scent.\n\"Uh. D'you say, aliens?\" Leroy took his hat off to scratch at some dandruff. Mr. Smolpekir spat again. \"Yep. Little fuckers ruined my field and took me up in their spaceship. Can't member much cuz shit's fuzzy but what I do know is they dropped me off at the wrong damn place. And gave me a hard on that won't go away.\" He pointed towards his lower extremity that poked through the denim, still at attention. \"Damn thing hasn't gone down since I woke up in Nutbug, can't even piss right.\" Leroy accidentally looked at the old man's crotch and instantly regretted it. \"Yea it's hard to piss when yer at attention down there.\" He gave a chuckle but the old man didn't laugh. He scratched at his sweaty armpit and got stern with Leroy. \"No dummy. I don't piss right. When I gotta go it either comes out my mouth or my ass. It's the damnedest thing.\" Boomer walked up during this part of the conversation. \n\nAccording to Mr. Smolpekir, he was taken up aboard a spacecraft that was fiddling with his corn field. He doesn't remember much while on the ship aside from bright lights and ugly little creatures. However he did say at one point he saw a pretty good looking female alien that resembled a young version of his wife. Leroy laughed at that part but was shunned by the other two and bit his tongue. The last thing the old man remembered was wandering around Nutbug Falls with only a shirt on and that's when Leroy and Boomer picked him up. \n\nClearly his memory had returned after the men brought him back home. The boner he was sporting had not left him and whenever he had to urinate, it would shoot out of his mouth like vomit or out of his anus like liquid diarrhea. It was involuntary and he admitted to wearing a pair of depends adult diapers. And being cautious when it felt like something was gonna shoot out of his mouth. The younger men couldn't believe the story but Boomer started to wonder about the strange things happening around the area. That's when a connection hit him like a ton of bricks. \"Daisy!\" He blurted out with no warning and the words startled his companions. \"Huh?\" Leroy questioned the outburst. \"The smell around Daisy, it's the same thing I'm smellin here.\" He was referring to that metallic scent previously discussed. Leroy sniffed the air. \"Well I'll be dipped in sheep shit. You're right. I can smell it.\" Kalido the dog barked in agreement, all three humans not realizing she was there listening to the conversation. Speculations started to form around the idea that Daisy's death, the dog's new leg, the corn field and Mr. Smolpekir's abduction was related. They all looked at the fallen stalks around them, noticing it was only certain sections that had been victim to the malformation while other spots were untouched. \"I wanna check something real quick.\" Boomer walked towards the house and scaled one of the wooden pillars and climbed up on the roof. Leroy watched him with confusion. \"Yep! It's a fuckin crop circle!\" Boomer's voice echoed through the air. Leroy looked at Mr. Smolpekir and they asked each other in unison. \"A what?\" Boomer hopped down, creating a 4.1 magnitude earthquake. He walked back to explain to the men what a crop circle was.\n\nFor those of you who are unaware, crop circles are strange patterns created in fields that happen over night. Some are hoaxes with simple shapes while others are more intricate, leaving many to believe they are done by extraterrestrial spacecraft. You know, UFOs. Well nowadays they're called UAPs, Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon. But let's face it, UFOs sound way cooler.\nAnyway, the big man explained it with the other listening intently. \"And how do you know about this shit? Leroy asked. \"My cousin is into weird shit like this. Him and his wife deal in this type of stuff. It's a bit out there but somehow they make a living from it. We may need to call and get his opinion.\" His cousin didn't answer so there was nothing more to do. But with a hypothesis of what was happening, Leroy and Boomer kept one eye to the sky."},"87":{"title":"The Rivera Journals PT3","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1gs3mw1\/the_rivera_journals_pt3\/","flair":"Story","author":"mas8394","selftext":"Hey guys! I found the continuation of the journal so this was a pretty quick turn around!!

Amateur sleuth over here!\n\nI\u2019ll put links to part 1 and 2 down below and I\u2019ll get all three parts merged together before the next release!\n\nAnyways, let me know what you think!!!\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChapter 3: The Police\n\n\"Gotchu, Tams, calling it in,\" Desean's voice flickered off as he made the call. \n\nA groaning sound reverberated down the brightly lit corridor, and Tammy shivered. Her grip tightened on the flashlight as if the metal cylinder alone could ward off whatever was out there. \n\n\"H-Hello?\" The words barely squeaked out. Her earlier confidence had waned again. \"Oh, hell no, what am I even doing,\" she muttered, her whisper equal parts curse and coping mechanism. \"Desean\u2019s the one with the gun, not me. Why this gotta happen to me and my damn flashlight, Lord...\"  \n\n \n\nTammy\u2019s rambling stopped as a hand\u2014pale, stiff, wrong\u2014extended out of the end of the corridor, gripping the corner of the wall.\n\n \n\nHer breath hitched. \"Oh, hell no, not again,\" Tammy whispered, voice trembling as she inched forward, every step a battle against her instincts to flee.  \n\n \n\nThe hand was followed by an arm, then a shoulder, as a figure emerged from the corner\u2014jerking like a marionette, its movements stilted and unnatural.\n\n \n\n\"Tams, the police are on their way. Meet me outside,\" Desean's voice crackled faintly through the walkie-talkie.  \n\n \n\nTammy\u2019s voice caught in her throat. She couldn\u2019t answer. Her flashlight beam stayed trained on the emerging figure. The tension snapped as recognition hit her like a slap. It wasn\u2019t the creature.\n\n \n\nIt was the white boy from earlier.  \n\n \n\nNot the crazed, unshaven, smiling pale thing she\u2019d seen earlier but the actual man\u2014tanned, bearded, and disheveled, but unmistakably human.  \n\n \n\n\"Desean, get your ass up here. I think I found the white boy,\" Tammy radioed in, her voice hurried but steady.  \n\n \n\n\"White boy? You mean the Spanish dude?\" Desean cackled through the static.  \n\n \n\n\"Same shit! Get up here. He needs help,\" Tammy snapped.  \n\n \n\n\"I\u2019m busy talkin\u2019 to his friends. They\u2019re outside with the cops. I\u2019ll head in once we wrap up,\" Desean responded, his tone too casual for Tammy\u2019s liking.  \n\n \n\nTammy crouched beside the man. \"Man, what you doing here on the floor?\"  \n\n \n\nCassian groaned, his voice raspy and parched. \"I don\u2019t know... Feels like I got rammed by a truck. If I wasn\u2019t in this office, I\u2019d think I got Isekai\u2019d.\"  \n\n \n\nThe dry humor was faint, a fragile shield against the obvious pain.\n\n \n\nTammy rolled her eyes, but her worry crept into her tone. \"Boyyy, Heesaid what?\u2026 Let\u2019s get you up. The cops are on their way; they\u2019ll take care of you.\" She gripped his arm, heaving. \"Shit, your little ass is heavy. Never mind, you can stay here; I\u2019ll keep you company. What happened?\"  \n\n \n\nCassian\u2019s eyes widened, his breathing uneven. \"There was a scream,\" he muttered, the memory cutting through the fog. \"A woman, I think. She sounded terrified... No not really terrified\u2026 but it didn\u2019t sound real. Too loud, like it was echoing from everywhere at once. I was on the phone with my boss\u2014he can vouch\u2014\"  \n\n \n\n\"A scream?\" Tammy interrupted, her eyes flicking nervously toward the hallway. \"Ain\u2019t nobody else supposed to be in here except you and your \u2018 survey friends\u2019 who just showed up. You sure it wasn\u2019t somethin\u2019 like a speaker malfunctioning?\" \n\n \n\nCassian shook his head weakly. \"No. This site doesn\u2019t have a PA system or anything like that. I\u2019d know\u2014I\u2019m supposed to flag stuff like that for demolition.\" He coughed, wincing. \"I followed it, like a dumbass. Sounded like it came from one of the offices down the hall. When I got there, though... nothing. Just... nothing.\"  \n\n \n\nTammy stiffened. Her mind flashed to the \"evil twin\" she\u2019d seen earlier, the glowing blue eyes, the pitch-black corridor.  \n\n \n\n\"What happened next?\" Her voice was lower now, cautious.  \n\n \n\nCassian\u2019s gaze dropped. \"I remember a noise. Not just loud, but... layered, like fireworks going off all at once. Then I was flying backward, flung into the hallway. I think\u2014I think I hit something. I mean like I Punched \u2018it\u2019. Or... something. What ever \u2018it\u2019 is. I fought, I think, but it didn\u2019t matter. I wasn\u2019t going to win.\"\n\n \n\nTammy exhaled, her pulse pounding in her ears. \"Boy, you\u2019re bleeding. Stay still. I don\u2019t know what the hell got you, but it looks like a pit bull had a bad day and took it out on your side.\"  \n\n \n\nCassian groaned, struggling to sit up. Tammy caught sight of the blood pooling behind him and winced. \"Actually boo let\u2019s get you up, I don\u2019t wanna stay here, and I don\u2019t wanna meet your evil twin again.\"  \n\n \n\nCassian froze, her words like a slap. His voice dropped. \"What do you mean... my evil twin?\" the vivid memories of his nightmare doppelganger flooding through his mind, the phantom feeling of the bite on his neck.\n\n \n\nTammy stiffened. She hadn\u2019t meant to say that. \"Look,\" she said cautiously, crouching closer, \"when I came in, I saw something. Looked like you, but it wasn\u2019t you. Clean-shaven, creepy-ass smile, and those eyes\u2014God, those eyes weren\u2019t right. Too blue, almost glowing. A little like your eyes, but so much icier\".\n\n \n\nCassian\u2019s breathing quickened. His hand flew to his neck, remembering a phantom wound, and then to his side \u2013 feeling a real wound.  \n\n \n\n\"Yeah,\" Tammy confirmed. \" And it was dark, pitch black and then\u2014snap\u2014the lights came back on. And poof, he was gone. Like nothing happened. But it did.\"  \n\n \n\nTammy didn\u2019t have time to respond before his hand fell away from his neck, but his grimace didn\u2019t fade. A long pause stretched between them. The air felt thicker, as if the building itself was holding its breath.\n\n\"Hey,\" Tammy said, her voice a little softer now. \"You\u2019re gonna make it. But we need to move.\"\n\nShe helped him up again, though his weight nearly tipped her over. \"You sure you ain\u2019t carrying bricks under that shirt?\"\n\nCassian chuckled weakly, his breath ragged. \"Only my abs, when they\u2019re not covered in blood... or, you know, the pit bull bites.\"\n\nTammy shot him a look, but the humor helped steady her nerves, just a little. She turned the walkie-talkie back on, her hand trembling slightly as she clicked it. \"Desean, you still out there? We\u2019re moving.\"\n\nThe radio crackled, then Desean's voice came through, tight and wary. \"Yeah, I\u2019m here, Tams. But\u2026 we might have a problem.\"\n\nTammy\u2019s stomach sank. \"What kind of problem?\"\n\n\"You remember those friends that were gonna come help with the office survey?\" Desean asked, his tone off, as if he was speaking lower than usual.\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\u201cLike I said they showed up with the police and now they\u2019re taping the building off. The officers are saying no one can leave. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but they\u2019re not even letting the surveyors leave. I think they\u2019re worried about your boy.\"\n\nTammy looked down at Cassian, his face pale, the blood soaking his shirt. \"Well, he\u2019s hurt, bleeding, but he can\u2019t stay here.\"\n\nDesean was quiet for a moment before responding, \"Keep your radio low, Tams. I\u2019ll let you know what\u2019s up.\"\n\nTammy clicked off the walkie and helped Cassian limp down the hallway. They were moving slower now, the distance between them and the main entrance stretching out as her unease built with every step.\n\nCassian\u2019s suspicion crept in again. \"Why do I have a feeling there's more to this than creepy screams and evil twins? Are the cops even real cops?\"\n\nTammy froze. \"Boy, don\u2019t even say that. Keep it together.\" She gave him a quick squeeze for reassurance, but deep down, she couldn\u2019t shake the dread gnawing at her.\n\nThe sound of footsteps approached, and two officers turned the corner\u2014one holding a cheap medical kit. The plastic box looked like it was straight out of an online store.\n\n\"I\u2019m Officer Enid, and this is Officer Mathers,\" the first officer said, his voice businesslike. \"Mathers here will take care of you for now. I\u2019m going to have to pull Miss Johnson aside to take a report, but don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll be in good hands.\"\n\nCassian didn\u2019t respond, his eyes flicking between the officers, the words swirling in his head. Something wasn\u2019t right.\n\nOfficer Mathers gestured for Cassian to sit, then knelt next to him. \"Alright, man, let\u2019s take care of those wounds. Looks like you\u2019ve been through hell.\" He began spraying a brown antiseptic fluid over Cassian\u2019s side, his hands methodical but too casual for the severity of the situation.\n\nCassian winced. \"Honestly, officer, I have no idea what happened. One minute I was talking to my boss, and then... I heard this scream. It was so loud, like it was coming from everywhere at once. Then next thing I know, I\u2019m fighting something\u2014and I wake up with you guys here.\"\n\n\"Sounds like a rough day, huh?\" Mathers muttered, dabbing at the wound with gauze. \"You sure you didn\u2019t just knock your head too hard? Trauma can make people hallucinate.\"\n\nCassian blinked, the words sinking in, but something in Mathers' tone was off. He didn\u2019t seem concerned enough for a man covered in blood. \"Yeah,\" Cassian said, forcing himself to sound normal. \"A bit rough.\"\n\nMathers hummed in response, too preoccupied with the wound to notice Cassian\u2019s growing suspicion.\n\n\u201cHow long until the ambulance arrives?\u201d Cassian huffed out, licking his dry lips as Mathers finishes wrapping him up.\n\n\u201cRadios went down at 1:08PM and it\u2019s 1:45PM, I have to assume they\u2019ll be here any moment now.\u201d Mathers gently patted the bandage, \u201cgood as new\u201d.\n\nCassian blinked, \u201c1:08PM?\u201d\n\nMathers nodded, unfazed, \u201cYeah. Phones are down too for some reason. No clue what happened. We thought it was a glitch, but\u2026 well, we\u2019re still figuring things out.\u201d\n\nCassian blinked again, \u201cOne\u2026. One forty-five\u2026. P\u2026.M\u2026\u201d\n\nMathers looked at him, \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\nCassian felt the world tilt. Things didn\u2019t add up. \u201cI\u2019ve been unconscious since 9AM, but all I have to show for it is this weird mark on my side.\u201d\n\nMathers shrugged, \u201cWell, yeah guess you\u2019ve been out for awhile, man,\u201d he was packing up the medical kit as Cassian\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He\u2019d been unconscious for hours, sharing a space with what Tammy called  his Evil Twin. What happened here? \n\nCassian\u2019s mind raced. The scream. The \"evil twin.\" The officers acting too casual. The radios going down. Everything felt wrong.\n\nCassian\u2019s eyes flicked toward Officer Mathers, his thoughts racing. \"You said the radios went down at 1:08 PM? But I swear it was only 9 when I called Tommy.\" He felt a strange pressure in his chest, like the weight of the whole situation was pressing on him from all sides.\n\nMathers didn\u2019t seem to notice. \"Yeah, time\u2019s weird, huh? Doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s been that long. You\u2019re just lucky we found you, man. Things could\u2019ve gotten... messy.\"\n\nCassian\u2019s mind spun. \"Messy\" didn\u2019t begin to cover it.\n\nCassians head throbbed as memories flashed in and out. \"What the hell\u2019s going on here?\"\n\nMathers paused for a beat, looking up with a faint, too-casual grin. \"Hell if I know. You\u2019re not the only one with questions, man. We\u2019re all trying to figure it out. But we\u2019ll get you out of here soon enough once the EMT arrives.\"\n\nCassian forced himself to stay calm, but his mind was a whirlwind of doubt. The officers\u2019 behavior was too easy, too practiced. There was no urgency in Mathers\u2019 words, no real concern for the severity of the situation. Cassian wanted to ask more, but the words lodged in his throat. He wasn\u2019t sure he trusted any of this anymore.\n\nMather whispered to Cassian, \"I\u2019m gonna be honest with you, the moment we entered the 15th block is when everything went down\", a pause and then Mathers continued, \"pretty cryptic but---\", \"Mathers, please wrap up detailing Miss Tamiah Johnson\u2019s report here while I catch this gentleman\u2019s information\u201d, Officer Mathers stands up walks over to Tammy, \"Hi miss...\", and the two walk down the hall so Tammy can point out and detail out her experience. \n\nOfficer Enid took down Cassian\u2019s information, including his address and....\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHoly shit guys the author must have been excited or inspired by his own life, but this is my address!! I'll be leaving this portion out the story, sorry for my intrusion. Honestly I think I\u2019m going to stop the story here for now, I am way to creeped out about the fact he left this address in here.\n\nAlso I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t quite catch that earlier, but\u2026 Cassian Rivera.\n\nThe Rivera\u2019s - that\u2019s the sellers of the house.\nGuess his wife didn\u2019t change her last name.\n\nMan must have lost his inspiration for names and addresses haha 18th and market is an actual place, I think it\u2019s a lawyers place now but their address is actually on 17th. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m going to do a little bit of research on this 18th and market street area of Philadelphia and see if I see anything. I also keep looking around my house, I don\u2019t see anything weird like bullet holes, just what I told you in my earlier posts.\n\nOh man this is exciting.\n\n\n\nEdit: Excuse my spelling and brevity by the way!

It landed screen-up and spun towards Tom\u2019s feet, gliding smoothly against the ground like an air hockey puck. He hastily bent over to stop his phone\u2019s forward motion, pocketing it without looking at the screen. Tom already knew what pictures would be opened on his messaging app. Instead, he went silent and did not argue, turning his head away from her and submissively placing his hands in the air. The motion was meant to represent a white flag of surrender, but more than that, it was a way of admitting guilt without asking for forgiveness.\u00a0\n\nWordlessly, he pushed past his wife to grab a pillow from his side of the bed and then paced quickly out of the room. Tom turned right as he exited, carefully stepping over a few unopened moving boxes to make his way to their new home\u2019s staircase. With a sound like rolling thunder, he stomped and pounded each foot against every step on his way up. Every petulant boom reverberated and echoed in Cassandra\u2019s mind. When Tom reached the attic, he bellowed something that was clearly meant to be a defamatory finale to his boyish tantrum, but she couldn\u2019t make out exactly what he said from where she still stood motionless in the bedroom. At that moment, any lingering regret about dosing her husband for the first time that morning with the Curandero\u2019s poison evaporated from her, remorse made steam by the molten heat of her seething anger.\u00a0\n\n\u2014---------------------------\n\n*\u201cIf I\u2019m an animal, you\u2019re a goddamned blood-sucking leech, Cassandra!\u201d*\u00a0\n\nTom\u2019s retreat from his wife had been both unanticipated and expeditious. To that end, he could not think of a retort to her jab until he was three steps out of the bedroom, but he held onto the retort until he reached the safety of the attic\u2019s doorframe. He knew he could belt out his meager insult from that distance without fear of an additional counteroffensive. As soon as the words spilled from his mouth, he tumbled past the threshold into the attic and slammed the door behind him.\u00a0\n\nIt wasn\u2019t his fault Shiela was swooning over him, Tom smugly mused. She had volunteered those digital pinups of her own volition. That said, he had been actively flirting with the young secretary since the couple landed in Texas two months ago. Their marriage had been in a death spiral for years, in no small part due to Tom\u2019s cyclical infidelity. The cross-country move had been a last-ditch attempt at resuscitating their relationship, but of course, Maine was never the problem to begin with, so the change of scenery mended nothing. In his middle age, Tom developed a gnawing desire to feel warm-blooded and virile. Cassandra\u2019s despondency had the exact opposite effect. She made him feel undesired - sexually anemic. That night was not the first time he had called her a \u201cblood-sucking leech\u201d for that very reason. However, if Tom had been gifted the power of retrospection, he may have noticed that his wife\u2019s frigid disposition became the norm after the discovery of his second affair, not after his first.\u00a0\n\n\u2014---------------------------\n\n*\u201cI want something that will make him feel even a small fraction of the insanity he\u2019s put me through\u201d*\n\nCassandra whispered to the Curandero, visually scanning the entire antique store for possible interlopers or undercover police officers before she asked the purveyor of hexes standing behind the counter for anything definitive and incriminating. Multiple family members had recommended this unassuming shop on the outskirts of downtown Austin for an answer to Tom\u2019s beastliness. The apothecary grinned and asked her to wait a moment, turning to enter a backroom concealed by a red silk curtain. The witch doctor was not what Cassandra expected - she couldn\u2019t have been older than thirty, and she certainly did not present herself like a practitioner of black magic. No cataracts, scars or gemstone necklaces - instead, she sported an oversized gray turtleneck with part of a floral sundress peeking out from the bottom.\u00a0\n\nShe returned seconds later, tilted her body over the counter, and handed Cassandra a vial no bigger than a shot glass. Inside the vial were innumerable tiny blue crystals. They were slightly oblong and transparent, looking like the illegitimate children of rock candy and fishfood. The Curandero cheerily instructed Cassandra to give her husband the entire ampule\u2019s contents over the course of about three days. As she left the store, the shopkeeper cryptically reassured Cassandra that her husband would be thoroughly educated on his wrongdoings by the loving kiss of retribution.\u00a0\n\n\u2014---------------------------\n\n*\u201cWhy is it so fucking cold up here\u201d*\n\nTom mumbled to himself, doing laps around the perimeter of his makeshift sleeping quarters in the attic. It had been approximately three weeks since their argument and his subsequent relocation. At first, he didn\u2019t much mind it. The cold war between him and Cassandra was taxing, but he had his phone and Shiela\u2019s escalating solicitations to keep him company. But as of the last few days, he had begun to feel progressively unwell - feverish and malaised. Then he noticed the small lump on the underside of his left wrist.\u00a0\n\nIt was about the size of a dime, skin-colored, immobile, and profoundly itchy. Tom felt like he spent almost every waking minute massaging the area. The irritation then became accompanied by white-hot burning pain, gradually extending up his arm as the days passed. One night, as he scratched the area, the lump moved a centimeter closer to his palm. He paused to inspect the change, assuming the vexing cyst had finally been dislodged and neutralized. After a few seconds, however,\u00a0 it moved again - but in the opposite direction and without Tom\u2019s help. And then again, slightly further up his forearm. Revitalized by panic and confusion, he began clawing recklessly at the lump, until the skin broke and a small black button was liberated from the wound, only to scurry away to an unseen sanctuary. Tom thought the button looked and moved like a deer tick.\u00a0\n\n\u2014---------------------------\n\n*\u201cSure, Tom, come back down. But to the couch, for now, okay?\u201d*\n\nCassandra had accepted many empty apologies from Tom before, but something about this most recent one felt slightly more sincere. By this point, she had completely forgotten about the Curandero and her vengeful prescription. Cassandra had gone through with slipping the contents into Tom\u2019s coffee over the course of three days, but that was over a month ago. At the time, she did not really believe it was black magic - she assumed it was a military-grade laxative or some other, ultimately benign, poison.\u00a0\n\nThe more she thought about Tom\u2019s behavior, however, she came to realize that she may have been mistaking a sincere apology for what was actually fear and need for comfort. Cassandra had not interacted much with Tom in the past few weeks, but now that she was, he was certainly acting off. Seemingly at random, he would slam his palm down on himself or something else in front of him and then would be unwilling to give an explanation. He slurred his words like a drunken sailor, but as far she could tell, he hadn\u2019t been drinking. When she looked into Tom\u2019s eyes to find that his pupils were rapidly dilating and constricting like black holes on the verge of collapse, the realization hit like a lightning strike up her spine. Cassandra remembered the vial with the blue crystals.\u00a0\n\nShe was at the Curandero\u2019s shop within the hour, catching the witch doctor right as she was locking up her store. Cassandra pleaded with her for an antidote to whatever magic or venom was now in Tom\u2019s system. In response, the shopkeeper produced another identical vial from her jacket pocket, twisted the cap off, and dropped a few of the crystals into her mouth:\n\n*\u201cIt\u2019s dyed salt, my love\u201d*\u00a0the Curandero said, then pausing to tap out a few fragments onto the backside of Cassandra\u2019s hand as a means to corroborate her claim.\u00a0*\u201cI don\u2019t sell power, just the idea of power. Whatever you made manifest, I only provided the inspiration\u201d*\n\nConfused and without clear direction, Cassandra returned home to check on her husband.\u00a0\n\n\u2014---------------------------\n\nTom had never been thirstier in his entire life, but he could not drink. Every time he poured himself water, he carefully inspected it through the transparent glass, only to find it contaminated with hundreds of ticks - an entire galaxy of black stars drifting aimlessly through the liquid microcosm. Sitting at his kitchen table with his head in his hands, Tom cried out in agony, only to have his wail cut short by his vocal cords unexpectedly snapping shut.\u00a0\n\nWhat had started as an infestation had become a plague.\u00a0\n\nThe gentle touch of a hand on his shoulder nearly scared him half to death, causing him to jump back off his chair and knock the infested glass off the table and onto the kitchen floor, shattering it instantly. He took a breath, seeing that it was only Cassandra, but that relief was short-lived when he looked back down to see an armada of nymphs moving on his position. He yelped and scrambled on top of a cabinet. His wife moved forward, seemingly to comfort him. When she held his hand, Cassandra noticed the open wound where that first tick had sprouted, and she rushed into the other room to procure bandages. For a moment, Tom felt safe. His wife began attending to his wound while he was still perched on the cabinet. But then he felt a pinch on his left wrist, followed by an intense lacerating sting, and then finally, the sensation of warm fluid gushing down his palm. When he looked down, his wife looked up at him in tandem.\u00a0\n\nCassandra\u2019s mouth had mutated into a pulsating arena of hooked teeth, with plasma delicately dripping from the barbs she had just used to bite into him. In one swift motion, Tom pivoted his torso, unsheathed a blade from a nearby knife block, drove it deep into the creature\u2019s abdomen, and sprinted out the house and into the street.\u00a0\n\n\u2014---------------------------\n\nCassandra nearly bled out on her kitchen floor, but a neighbor heard the commotion and had called the police.\u00a0\n\nShe awoke in the ICU surrounded by family. When she asked them what happened, they paused awkwardly and traded solemn expressions with each other instead of explaining. When Cassandra pressed for information, they flagged down her doctor from the hallway.\n\nThe physician did not mince words with Cassandra. Tom was dead - he had been picked up by the police fleeing the neighborhood but had been delivered to the same ICU she was currently in when he started to wheeze violently and turn blue.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n*\u201cDo you have any pets, dogs especially?\u201d*\u00a0The doctor asked.\u00a0*\u201cWhere in your house do you and your husband sleep? Have you ever seen any bats in your home?\u201d*\n\nCassandra explained that they had bought their home recently, that Tom had been sleeping alone in their attic after a particularly nasty argument, and that she had seen a bat fly out a window once when they were moving in. She then detailed her husband\u2019s odd behavior in the time leading up to her assault.\u00a0\n\nThe physician frowned and then elaborated on their suspicions:\n\n*\u201cThe dilating pupils, the hallucinations, the fear of water, and the inspiratory spasms - they all suggest that your husband contracted rabies while living in your attic. Most of the time, people in the US contract the disease from a dog bite. However, bats are known to transmit the disease, too. What\u2019s worse - if bats are in your home, they can bite you in your sleep without you waking up. If contracted, the disease is universally fatal, and there is no known treatment.*\u00a0\n\n*Tom died from his airway spasms.*\u00a0\n\n*You nearly died, too - from blood loss. Did you know you have an extremely rare blood type? AB negative. Only 1% of the population has this blood type, and unfortunately, the hospital has been critically low on replacement blood that is AB negative for almost a month now.*\u00a0\n\n*We were initially very concerned - you needed more AB negative blood than we had, but as serendipity would have it, Tom was AB negative as well. Imagine that.*\u00a0\n\n*Thankfully, rabies cannot be contracted through the blood - only through saliva. That\u2019s why it is contracted through bites. Although it was unconventional, our administration gave us the green light to give you a large portion of his blood. In essence, Tom\u2019s blood saved your life\u201d*\n\nThe doctor paused, waiting patiently for whatever questions Cassandra had.\u00a0\n\nBut she had none. Instead, there was an eerie, uncomfortable silence for almost a minute.\n\nThen, Cassandra tilted her head back, closed her eyes, wept, and had a very long laugh.\u00a0\n\nMore Stories:\u00a0[https:\/\/linktr.ee\/unalloyedsainttrina](https:\/\/linktr.ee\/unalloyedsainttrina)"},"90":{"title":"The Last Time I Visit My Wife's Grave","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1gr2ir4\/the_last_time_i_visit_my_wifes_grave\/","flair":"Story","author":"CreepyLittleFella","selftext":"My wife and I had been married for about forty-four years when she passed.

My parents were kind of together but also kind of separated. Let me explain.\n\nI am an only child, my parents always only wanted a girl and that\u2019s exactly what they got, so they never had any more children,\nMy dad was the day time parent, while mum was out he stayed home, took me to school, fed me and played with me. He was an amazing dad. He even found time to earn some money to buy me treats.\nI would only ever see my mum when i was in bed. She was never home during the day so would always make sure she came to put me to bed.\n\nI always looked forward to bedtime, and she was never late. \nShe was strange but i loved that, instead of bedtime stories she would write me letters and draw pictures for me, that she must have prepared earlier that day. She was also obsessed with crime stories and would tell me some so we could try and solve them together. Our favourite story was \nA wild one! And it was local! So a lady (we\u2019ll call her lady 1) went missing for i think a few weeks, i\u2019m not sure on the timing, but after a while a different lady (lady 2) was found dead in lady 1\u2019s living room! People have no idea how she got there or why she was there, but it looked like suicide. My theory was she took lady 1 and maybe felt guilty for whatever happened, then went to lady 1\u2019s house and killed herself. But what happened? What did she do?! And where did lady 1 go?! My mum was proud of me for coming up with that. I still think about it every now and then. It was never solved. My mum managed to gather some photographs and other things to help with our \u201cinvestigations\u201d we had a picture of lady 2, she was beautiful with a very kind face, i know she probably committed murder but i always liked her face. I still remember what she looked like. \nShe had dirty Blonde hair, brown eyes, a pointy nose and thin lips, she had a little line through her left eyebrow like a scar maybe? I wonder if i still have those pictures, she also had blueprints of the house layout and photos of the house doors and windows so we could figure out how she got in.  \n\nAnyway, Sometimes i would try to bring up my dad to my mum but she wouldn\u2019t really say anything. She would always just look sad and change the subject. And whenever i mentioned mum to dad he would often shrug it off and change the subject too. It was the only thing i found sad in my childhood but was always quickly changed to a happier subject. \n\n I\u2019ll be visiting my dad soon, i moved to another city for university and have found a job, partner and home here now so i only see him occasionally, when i visit i\u2019ll ask if he has my old stuff and see if i can find the crime evidence and old letters from my mum i would love to go through them all again. \n\n\nUpdate: \nSo i found 2 boxes full of all the stuff! I had a quick look but not a proper one. I didn\u2019t mention it to dad to not bring up any bad memories, i\u2019m going to go through all this stuff tonight, maybe even longer depending on how much there is and update again. \n\nUpdate 2:\n\nOkay so i\u2019ve been looking at the crime stuff, some interesting cases we discussed, some boring ones. I noticed they\u2019re mostly quite old cases, i know they were all when i was a child, but even for then they were pretty old. The most recent one of the lot is the main one i remembered, the lady 1 and 2 case, that was a year after i was born. I found the picture of lady 2, after all these years i do still find her to have a kind beautiful face. I have seen the full case and i actually know the area this house is, I may look into it some more, Finish what we started. \n\nThe letters mum wrote however, i didn\u2019t remember any of them but now reading them, they\u2019re quite strange. There are some stories, kind of weird.. a bit eerie to read now that i\u2019m older. Like there\u2019s a poem about a kid being stuck in a room, asking to be let out but no one is listening, It\u2019s like a childish poem but the subject is a bit odd. There\u2019s another that\u2019s just describing directions through the house we lived in (Dad\u2019s house now)There is some with random numbers and letters that i can\u2019t figure out. The letters all consisted of only \u201cO, F, C, I, N\u201d and the numbers were only 9, 7, 1, 0 but there was these letters and numbers all over the page. And the drawings don\u2019t make alot of sense, like a brick wall with a few bricks highlighted. Another is one of a stickman on his knees arms up, like he\u2019s praying to a bright light shining down on him or something. \n\nUpdate 3: \nI went to look at the house where the suicide was committed, unfortunately people live there now, I wonder if they got a discount? Anyway, as i wasn\u2019t in the habit of committing a crime myself to look inside and am definitely not going to ask them if i can look around. I deciding to return home after a few sneak pics on my phone. Time for plan b, Google. I googled the house, Nothing. I googled the situation in great detail, Nothing, I did the photo google using lady 2 and i found it! The case! \n\u201cThe mystery of the suicide squatter\u201d \nis what the article i found was called. Strange, I assumed she was the murderer not a random squatter. But the article was pretty rubbish so they\u2019re probably wrong. I found a case number however, so i\u2019m going to find the case, how do i do that? Is it on google? Do i ring someone? Can a random person access these cases? find out in the next episode. \n\nUpdate 4: \nOkay. Holy Shit. So I don\u2019t know what to do.. I managed to get the case and there was alot more photos and there was notes from officers and more. But the main thing, the thing that has left me shaken, I found a picture of Lady 1. I can\u2019t say 100% because it\u2019s been a while, but she looks exactly like my mum. Why is my mum lady 1? Was she kidnapped? If so why was she with me? Why is the case not closed?! Did she escape? And why were we studying her own case?! I am so lost right now i need help, I need to speak to my dad but i just don\u2019t know what to say. I need some time to think about this, work up the courage to speak to my dad. Maybe i\u2019m just overthinking this and remembering mums face wrong. \n\nUpdate 5: \nSo i contacted my dad. I asked him if he had any pictures of my mum, Instead of telling him the whole story i thought i\u2019ll double check and i don\u2019t have any pictures. He sent me the picture. She is not Lady 1. \n\nShe is Lady 2. \n\nUpdate 6:\nMy mum, the woman i remember tucking me in every night, reading me stories, studying case files together, She is not my mum, She is Lady 1, the person who disappeared, And my REAL mum is apparently the Lady who committed suicide?! That makes no sense to me! \n\nI looked through everything in my boxes, the letters, the drawings, the numbers. The stories seem to be of someone trapped, there was a description of the layout of my dads house. A picture of bricks. \n\nI took all this stuff to my dads house. I didn\u2019t tell him why i was visiting just that i was staying for a few days. When he was out i followed the description, it seemed to be directions. Dad has this little closet type room that\u2019s only about 3 feet high and hidden in a corner of the house no one really goes. It led there. I went in and there was a brick wall. There was that drawing of bricks with some of them highlighted. I found a part of the wall that looked identical and the highlighted bricks were very brittle and just crumbled apart as i clawed at them. When i cleared it, It revealed a wooden wall. \n\nThe wall had a code lock and a type of small door, i looked in my notes and found the number\/letters one. When i looked properly to see if this was the code, i realised the 4 numbers rearranged were 07 91, my birth month and year. I opened the door.\n\nIt was a body. The letters must have spelt \u201cCoffin\u201d. I ran out and threw up in the toilet. I called my dad and he came home. We called the police. \n\nWe are now awaiting results from forensics.\n\n\nUpdate 7:\n\nIt\u2019s been a while. I have needed some time to distance myself from all this and get therapy. I am currently getting better with coping mechanisms i have learned and just thought i should update everything.\n\nThe results came back. The lady we found was lady 1. The one who went missing. The lady i spent my bedtimes hanging out with. She must have been trying to tell me all along she needed help. I spent alot of time thinking and it never occurred to me that i don\u2019t remember her dying. Just all of a sudden there was no more bedtime visits and it was only my dad. I spoke to dad about my real mum (lady 2) she committed suicide when i was 1 year old. My dad had no idea why, only that it was in someone elses house. It was too painful for him to talk about when i was younger. \n\nForensics found marks in the Skeleton and that indicated she had been stabbed to death. The knife was found with the body with my mums dna on it. \n\nThis poor lady came to her murderers daughter asking for help. My mum is a murderer who buried her victim in the house i lived in when i was 1 year old. I spent years staring at a picture of my mum not even knowing it was her. \n\nThis is my final update now. I need to move on from all this."},"92":{"title":"If I don't kill my best friend in the next twenty-four hours, there is a good chance she'll live in constant suffering for hundreds of years, but I won't know for sure until it's too late.

That being said, you don\u2019t need to believe me to help. If it all seems too outlandish to justify your time, consider this post to be a hyperspecific thought experiment instead. Whatever allows you to put yourself in my position, because I have no one else to lean on for guidance.\u00a0\n\nHere is the thought experiment: in twenty-four hours, you are going to kill the person you love most. Involuntary but inevitable murder. That\u2019s option A - the default ending to this thought experiment. Option B would be to kill them before the twenty-four-hour mark. There doesn\u2019t seem to be an option C, but I don\u2019t know that for sure.\u00a0\n\nIf you choose option A, you will die, too. But hey, that\u2019s maybe not the worst thing. You won\u2019t have to live with yourself afterward, unlike option B. In that scenario, you don\u2019t die by default but you do have a say in how things will transpire. Option B\u2019s appeal is control, I suppose. Oh also, in option B your loved one definitely dies - option A may instead leave them in perpetual agony for who knows how long. But you won\u2019t be alive to know about it, I guess. One more caveat - if option C exists, i.e. you both live, you only get there by going with option A and effectively doing nothing while hoping for the best.

No need to read further and your service to myself and mankind is very much appreciated. If you need more information, keep scrolling down.\n\nLet\u2019s start with this: I was born into a secret cult isolated from society somewhere in the West Virginian wilderness. We worship nature and the gods therein. Our leaders are known as the \u201cRed Vassals\u201d, and they are trying to eliminate the cancer of humanity via the cultivation of an ancient, preternatural tree, letting nature reclaim and regrow the world.\n\nTheir words, not mine.\u00a0\n\nOf course, they would live through that armageddon because of their unyielding devotion to nature and its regrowth. Normal cult stuff, to my limited understanding.\n\nAgain, if it helps, consider this all make-believe. I\u2019ve always thought it was bullshit, unlike my peers. Don\u2019t know why they are able to gulp down the metaphorical Kool-Aid like its water on a hot day, while I\u2019ve found myself vomiting it back out after a sip. I\u2019m just skeptical down to my DNA, I suppose. I certainly wasn\u2019t taught any skepticism from the Vassals, and I don\u2019t have parents in the traditional sense. None of us do.\u00a0\n\nIn our cult, there are two groups of people: the Vassals and the Gemini. The Gemini are further divided into two subgroups: essents and attendants, also known informally as roots and resins. Functionally, the Vassals raise, educate, and sacrifice us Gemini. The resins are taught that sacrifice is their only purpose, the roots are left blissfully unaware of their impending end. You would think it\u2019s better to be born a root, but I think the cruelty of not knowing, only to have the rug pulled out from under you, is actually much worse. I still haven\u2019t had the heart to tell Grace the whole truth. Unfortunately, it\u2019s hard to tell if that's what I actually want for her or if that's my attendant conditioning puppeting me from the shadows.\u00a0\n\nBoth groups live together at the \u201creservation\u201d, our compound in the deep Appalachian woods. The Vassals inhabit a large church in the center, with many smaller cottages surrounding it. I don\u2019t think the Vassals built the church themselves; I think they just refurbished it. Based on some Google image comparisons, it looks Christian in nature, but I\u2019ve never asked the Vassals directly. I believe the people who founded the cult happened across this long-abandoned place of worship and selected it as HQ because of the oak tree sprouting from the top. Whoever built the church in the first place designed it around the tree itself, creating a narrow shute in the ceiling to accommodate its growth. On the inside, all you can see is the massive tree trunk erupting from behind the pulpit. From the outside, you can appreciate the canopy resting on the roof. I think the choice to build the church around the tree was originally just a pragmatic one, an efficient and elegant way to use the landscape. In comparison, the Red Vassals clearly chose it because of the perceived symbolism. A primordial tree older than sin growing and enveloping a secular \u201chouse of god\u201d very succinctly sums up the cult\u2019s vision for the world.\u00a0\n\nYoung Gemini live in the church with the Vassals, with all the essents and attendants intermixed and coming to know each other. There's usually about fifteen or so young ones living with the Vassals at any one time.\u00a0 At some point, usually around the age of eight, however, Gemini are officially \u201ccoupled\u201d - one essent for one attendant, one root for one resin. They then move you out to one of the cottages, where you\u2019ll live together till your \u201cgermination\u201d ceremony. I.e. the part where they sacrifice us to the earth.\u00a0\n\nBut I am getting ahead of myself. Moreover, looking at the road signs from the bus window, I am running out of time. Need to speed things up a bit.\u00a0\n\nIn the beginning, there was Father Ludwig and his three daughters. During his upbringing, he reluctantly watched industrialization defile and destroy his birth-land. When he could no longer watch, he moved his family out into the woods, where they would happen across the place that would become the reservation with its symbolic chapel. For a few years, they lived a simple and peaceful life. But as he aged, Father Ludwig wondered what would become of his daughters when he died. He did not want them to stay and die on the reservation, effectively ending his bloodline, but he did not want them to return to modern society, either. He labored over this dilemma every night until exhaustion finally put him to sleep. That was until he had a spiritual vision that serves as the basis for this cult and, moreover, my existence.\n\nThe Vassals tell us Father Ludwig communed with the earth itself that night. In the vision, the earth told him they had been searching for someone pure of spirit to serve as a conduit for nature's divinity, allowing it to simultaneously exterminate and rewrite humanity. When asked if he was willing to be anointed the land\u2019s avatar and the new father of humankind, he accepted and asked the earth what to do next.\u00a0\n\nYes, it is all batshit.\u00a0 Bear with me, it actually gets worse.\u00a0\n\nSo, apparently, he woke up the next day, found a specific plot of land, and had his daughters bury him there alive. Before his face was completely covered with dirt, he told his children to come back to his grave in two months. When they did, he proclaimed that his daughters would find a small tree resembling a red maple. They would know it was his new form because they would be able to feel pulsations when they placed their hands on the trunk, almost like a heartbeat.\u00a0\n\nHis daughters, the original Red Vassals, successfully found Father Ludwig and his oaken heartbeat two months after they had buried him alive. Thus, they unquestioningly followed his instructions on how to grow their cult and bring about the world's end.\n\nTo do this, they would need to \u201ccultivate\u201d the land, which is where us Gemini come in. Now is a good time to mention that we are an entirely female society. Any male children are taken away at birth - either killed out of sight of the colony or just left to succumb to the elements in the woods, it's unclear. All men, excluding Father Ludwig in his tree-form I guess, are without a womb. They cannot create and bear fruit like the earth, so they have no home in our cult.\n\nI think the next question most would have is: how the fuck do they propagate? Well, one of three ways, if you believe the Vassals.\n\nVassals are responsible for all the births on the reservation, and your place in the society is dependent on the circumstances of your conception. If you are an attendant, you were conceived from an outsider. Obviously, the Vassals need to leave the reservation for supplies on a regular basis. When they do, some of them come back pregnant from one-night stands.\u00a0\n\nIf you are an essent, you were conceived from the \u201csap\u201d of the tree that used to be Father Ludwig. God knows what that actually means, and I think this is absolute horseshit - I believe the Vassals just\u00a0*decide*\u00a0arbitrarily who is who. But then, what's left? How do they make more Vassals? Simple, they just replicate themselves in a budding ritual, of course. Sometimes a new young woman will just appear among their ranks, and reproduction by budding, an immaculate conception, is the only explanation we have ever been given.\n\nSo like I mentioned before, essents and attendants are coupled together right before puberty. From that point on, you are each other\u2019s only family. Outside of daily educational sessions, Gemini who are coupled are forbidden to talk to anyone else, excluding Vassals, but only if they address you first. Co-dependency develops pretty much overnight.\u00a0\n\nOnce you are coupled, your education becomes segregated, too. Everything I detailed above is taught\u00a0*before*\u00a0segregation. From then on out, however, attendants learn one thing, essents learn something else entirely. Sharing of information, if discovered, is punishable by excommunication and death.\u00a0\n\nAttendants are taught the remainder of our so-called glorious purpose. Throughout our adolescence, we take field trips with the Vassals to a remote plot of land. From a distance, it just looks like a patch of red maples. They are all relatively uniform in size and appearance, excluding one in the center, which is significantly larger and taller - apparently, that one is Father Ludwig. Still alive, still growing. The other red maples are buried essents, young women that we all used to know - also still alive, also still growing.\u00a0\n\nIf there are any attendants who have never been to visit Father Ludwig before, we are treated to an additional spectacle that day. A Vassal will be present at the forest's perimeter and waiting for us to arrive with an honored guest - an outsider, in handcuffs, naked as the day they were born, usually screaming and cursing at us. Since they\u2019re so close to Father Ludwig, they\u2019ll already start to look unwell - their faces purple and swollen with clotting blood.\u00a0\n\nThe attendants then watch as the outsider is dragged by their arms closer and closer to Father Ludwig. This is where the screaming starts to get to me. The helpless, confused outsider\u2019s arms and legs will start to become unnaturally distended with fluid, doubling in size over the course of a few minutes. If you have good eyesight, you\u2019ll be able to see outlines of blood vessels appear, bloated and congested with coagulated plasma on practically every inch of their body. At a certain point, the screams will stop, and the Vassals will drop the victim\u2019s arms and leave them to decompose where they now lay. Typically, they are still a quarter of a mile from Father Ludwig when they die.\u00a0\n\nAccording to the Vassals, Father Ludwig and the buried essents release a start of pollen that is responsible for the outsider\u2019s horrific transformation. When inhaled, it rapidly clots human blood, causing the vasculature to completely solidify when exposed to it at a high enough concentration. We are all immune, of course, as we are all descendants of Father Ludwig. His blood shields us.\u00a0\n\nThat was the first time my disbelief was really tested. To my peers, that was definitive confirmation that everything we are taught is true. But how easy would it be to poison an outsider right before we arrive and then drag them toward that patch of red maples while the poison is at maximum effect? Sure would look like something supernatural was taking place.\u00a0\n\nAs a point of clarification, The Vassals don\u2019t plan on dragging everyone out to Father Ludwig one by one. That apocalypse would be a little inefficient. What we are told, however, is that the pollen travels on the wind to nearby outsider settlements as far as thirty miles away. The people in those settlements have a life expectancy\u00a0*half*\u00a0the national average. They die of all sorts of clots - in the brain, in the lungs, in the heart - and apparently, no one understands why, but the Vassals attribute it to consistent, small doses of Father Ludwig. And as the patch surrounding him grows, the radius that the pollen reaches grows too. They say it will take a few hundred years, but they are confident that they will win the war of attrition in time.\u00a0\n\nOf course, they need our help to do that. So, on an attendant\u2019s seventeenth birthday, we will be delivered to Father Ludwig with our essent in tow. Not in a large group like the field trips - just a coupled Gemini and one Vassal. When we reach the patch of red maples, we will find an empty grave on the periphery, pre-dug before our arrival. Wordlessly, we are expected to incapacitate our essent, our only family, with physical violence. The accompanying Vassal will assist in this. Then, we will tie the essent\u2019s wrists and ankles, they will be thrown in the grave, and we will bury them alive. At no point should we speak to our essents to explain. The only way they will germinate into a red maple, like Father Ludwig, is through desperate confusion and deep betrayal. It \u201ccracks their spirit open\u201d, allowing his roots to take hold within them.\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s the whole premise - the only way the essents will grow and produce the deadly pollen, as told to Father Ludwig in his vision, is if they are subjected to uncompromising, mind-shattering betrayal. They are seeds that need the right conditions to germinate, otherwise they remain dormant indefinitely. The coldness of profound despair ripens their holy blood for communion.\n\nFather Ludwig senses their vulnerability once an essent is broken and buried in the ground. In response, he pushes the ends of his roots through the soil and into their skin, providing the necessary oxygen to keep their tissue alive as well as catalyzing their metamorphosis. But they still need nutrients, of course. So after an essent is no longer visible in their grave, an attendant lies down on top of the disturbed earth. The Vassal present proceeds to bury us, too. The essent will then quickly grow into and through us, utilizing our blood and tissue as fuel to project themselves towards the surface. Once they are through the topsoil, the sun does the rest in terms of nutrition.\u00a0\n\nEssents are seeds, and we are their fertilizer.\u00a0\n\nAs I alluded to before, essents learn none of this. I suspect they aren\u2019t taught much of anything, other than they are special and that one day, they will be able to grow beyond the confines of the reserve, out into the world like so many essents before them. I don\u2019t think most of them even know there is a world beyond the reserve.\u00a0That is only speculation, though.\n\nAttendants, on the other hand, are very much aware of the world beyond us. We are given a full and detailed man-made genocides and atrocities. We are even allowed to utilize laptops during certain free times over the course of the day. I think the Vassals need us to believe that humanity is corrupted beyond repair and that the state of the world is beyond saving; otherwise, we might try to abscond with our essents to try to live a different life, with a different purpose. To me, allowing us to use the internet feels like they are saying: \u201cwhat, you don\u2019t believe that everything has gone to shit? Okay then, spend a few hours on the internet. Let me know what you think.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a clever system, I\u2019ll give them that. They create dependency, which turns into love, and then they use that love to install guardrails that keep us in line. For example, there is a roll call every morning. If one part of a Gemini isn\u2019t present at the roll call, the other is killed on the spot. Thought it was a hollow threat till I saw it myself.\u00a0It wasn't a quick death, and I would never allow Grace to be put through it.\n\nLeaving as a couple would be viable, except the Vassals figured out a way around that too - essents are fed an extremely high dose of sedatives every morning. If they go a day without the medication, the withdrawal is supposedly so intense that it effectively fries their brain. So, to leave together, you would need to have the medication as well, and a lot of it, which is naturally kept under lock and key.\u00a0\n\nThe Vassals go out of their way to make it seem completely hopeless. Even if we were to get away, they said, our \u201cdivine training\u201d would eventually kick in. They told us that we have no choice in delivering our essents to Father Ludwig. We could not reject our purpose even if we wanted to, and thinking we could is a delusion and a cardinal sin that has no equal.\n\nBut let\u2019s say you were still willing to try to escape - even if you got a few days' supply of the sedatives, only the Vassals know the routes back to civilization. Could we use the Internet to contact the rest of the world for help? Sure, but no one would believe us, and again, we have no idea where we are. Well, we used to have no idea, but explaining that discovery starts with what happened to Holly.\u00a0\n\nHolly was the only other attendant I\u2019ve ever known who didn\u2019t seem to buy into all of this at face value. She was a few years older than me. We weren\u2019t friends, per se, but we were aware of each other\u2019s doubts. The biggest difference was our perspective. She was hellbent on getting herself and her essent away from the reservation. As much as I love Grace, my essent, I fell victim to paralyzing apathy for a few years. In my mind, we had both been unlucky enough to have been born into this unwinnable situation orchestrated by a coven of murderous lunatics, but at least we\u2019d get to die together, close to each other. I wasn\u2019t worried about Grace being reborn or mutated into a fucking red maple tree. Not till Holly.\u00a0\n\nSo, it\u2019s between classes one day, and Holly covertly slips a note into my hand. It says to sit down at a computer next to her and to listen closely to what she has to say but to not look at her or raise suspicion. She tells me that she spent some time getting close to one of the younger Vassals, promising her unsavory reimbursement if she were to take her to visit Father Ludwig, just the two of them. Normally, we are blindfolded when we visit on our field trips, but Holly was able to convince this younger Vassal to not only take her there, but to take her there unobstructed. Holly\u2019s plan was to watch for some sign of civilization on the way, memorize whatever she could, and then google the location upon her return. A distant water tower with a county name on it allowed her to make a reasonable guess of the reserve\u2019s location.\u00a0\n\nBut in the process, she got more than she bargained for. The young Vassal was zealous and overexcitable, so when they arrived at the plot of land, she was dead-set on showing Holly something. She took Holly to the most recently germinated plot of land, where a fledgling red maple had begun to sprout. The Vassal asked Holly to wait a few yards away, and then out of nowhere, she took out a hand shovel from her satchel and started digging a small hole aside the tree. After waiting for almost an hour, The Vassal waved Holly over, turned on a flashlight, handed it to her, and then directed her to point the light into the hole.\n\nI think the Vassal assumed this was why Holly had requested to bring her to Father Ludwig in the first place - to see the vengeful benediction of nature in real-time.\u00a0\n\nHolly started gagging from the smell of decay before she could visualize what the Vassal was trying to show her. She covered her nose with a hand and part of her shirt and then was able to look inside, only to see a rotting human hand pierced by at least ten, red-brown pulsating worms. At least, that is what she thought at first, because she could see them twitching and throbbing. But upon further inspection, they had a splintered, wooden complexion. Like roots.\n\nShe stepped back in stunned horror, but the Vassal then indicated that there is another, greater miracle she wanted Holly to observe. Reluctantly walking forward and placing her head closer to the hole, she finally saw it - between the tendons and bone of the hand, an eye was looking back up at her. At first, she thought she was seeing things - like it was an optical illusion created by fungus and dirt.\u00a0\n\nAfter a few seconds of watching, however, the eye blinked. And after another few seconds, it blinked again. And again. Apparently, it almost looked like it was tearing up, but Holly admits she may be superimposing her own feelings on the traumatic memory.\u00a0\n\nHer story roused me from my fatalistic catatonia, and I finally was no longer sleepwalking - I was reignited. I became genuinely fearful for Grace, that she could possibly be put through such abominable suffering. But even more than that, now that we knew approximately where we were, I was hopeful that there was something more than this for us in the cards.\u00a0\n\nHolly then pulled me into the chair she was sitting in. In the process, she stood up, turned around, and began keeping watch. She asked me to quickly review and memorize the map she had pulled up on her computer.\u00a0\n\nTo make a longer story short, Holly and her essent died trying to escape. But I learned from her mistakes, and a year later, Grace and I made it out of the woods in one piece. In the months before we left, I was able to slowly pilfer the supplies we needed to make it on our own - food, water, medication, a few hundred dollars, and the night before we left, a backpack and a laptop. Originally, I had given up completely on the idea of escape after Holly's death. But as my seventeenth birthday approached, I found myself unable to cope with the idea of Grace existing in a state of perpetual undeath in the cold hard ground, comforted only by the lecherous roots of Father Ludwig.\u00a0\n\nIt felt like a happy ending at first. We have been away from the reservation for two whole weeks. Grace didn't understand what was happening, but she trusted my judgement. When we hit a major highway, and then a bus station with trips as far north as Maine, I thought it was all over. But now, I\u2019m not so sure.\u00a0\n\nInitially, we made it as far as Pennsylvania. We slept a night in a shitty motel, and then I bought us a bus ticket to Vermont the following morning. Grace and I slept most of the ride, but when I woke up, we had gone South, not North. I looked at my ticket in disbelief, and it revealed our destination was the town closest to the reservation - the first bus station we arrived at a few days' prior. A coincidental mistake made by my exhausted mind, I thought. That rationalization soothed me until the same coincidental mistake happened a second time. And now, a third. Each time I was convinced I had purchased a different ticket, but each time it eventually became clear that I didn\u2019t. And now we are out of time.\n\nMy so-called \u201cdivine training\u201d kicked in. I suppose.\u00a0\n\nIt seems my subconscious is doing everything possible to drag Grace back to West Virginia and Father Ludwig. I\u2019m still not sure I believe it all; everything I have to work with is secondhand experience. Even my subconscious overriding my free will could just be psychosocial conditioning and not a sign of an inescapable supernatural trajectory.\u00a0\n\nBut is it worth risking it? What if the clock ticks over into my birthday, and I go from having partial control of my actions to zero control? If I kill Grace now, I can at least assure myself she won\u2019t be buried in proximity of Father Ludwig. But maybe this is something I just have to keep fighting, and eventually, its hold will break over me.\u00a0\n\nKilling Grace is still the safest bet, though. It wouldn\u2019t be violent or painful. An overdose of her medication could cause her to peacefully drift off to somewhere much better than this.\u00a0\n\nSo tell me - what\u2019s worse, killing your only family involuntarily or of your own volition?\u00a0\n\nMore\u00a0[r\/nogreatanswers](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nogreatanswers\/)\u00a0and other stories:\u00a0[https:\/\/linktr.ee\/unalloyedsainttrina](https:\/\/linktr.ee\/unalloyedsainttrina)"},"93":{"title":"\"A Lost Cause\" - All Chapters so far.

Her ramblings do sound insane, speaking of A creature that just stalks you. A distorted face with long eyes and the most unsettling smile you\u2019ll see. It\u2019s tall in height, she says standing around 7 feet. Its arms though she says are the most confusing part as they are so long that they drag along the floors.\u00a0\n\n\u201cCome on Jason, Just this one thing for me. I don\u2019t ask for much\u201d she pleaded, her eyes and face visibly full of fear.\u00a0\n\nI sigh, a little annoyed but can\u2019t take seeing my friend in so much distress. \u201cFine, fine. You can stay at my place. I have an air mattress stored away you can use if we move the couch back against the wall\u201d\n\n\u201cOh my god! Thank you!\u201d she exclaimed, hugging me so tight it got hard to breathe.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah, but you should go to the police, you know. They exist, most characters in horror movies would survive if they called the police\u201d I responded carefully, not wanting to trigger her in her already high emotional state.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI did, trust me. I\u2019m not stupid Jason. They won\u2019t believe me though no matter what.\u201d She exclaims again as if I said the stupidest thing possible\n\n\u201cOkay then, our police just suck\u201d I respond, finally starting up again but going to my house instead of dropping her off. It was true though, our police suck. The system sucks. They probably wouldn\u2019t figure out a crime if the steps were laid out for them and the criminal was obvious. I remember this one time where there was a cult in town which killed an innocent man apart of the cult as a sacrifice for \u201cThe Watcher\u201d. I don\u2019t know much about them except they praised this Watcher fellow believing he was god or something.\u00a0\n\nWe walk past a graveyard as we walk ahead. I\u2019m so lost in my own thoughts that when I heard a shriek, I jumped and glanced at the graveyard next to us thinking someone was cut in half based on that sound.\n\n\u201cHe-h-He was there.\u201d SIlvia hugged me, sobbing into my chest.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey, hey. It\u2019s okay \"I responded, hugging her back trying to calm her down. I glance around the graveyard, seeing nothing there.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI-It\u2019s hunting m-m-me\u201d she sobs violently, no signs of calming down.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s going to be okay. I swear\u201d I try to comfort her, still looking around but seeing nothing. \u201cHey, let's just head to my house, kay?\u201d I responded, just trying to get her to my house so she finally feels safe.\n\n\u201cO-o-kay\u201d she sniffles, voice shaky as she follows me. We went to my house quickly, as fast as we could. I open the door, leading her into the house immediately and slamming the door shut.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey, hey. Calm down. It can\u2019t get you in here\u201d I say, setting her on the couch. It took an hour to calm her down but I finally did, worn out by then. We set up the air mattress, ate dinner, normal afternoon things.\u00a0\n\n\u201cNight Silvy\u201d I say, calmly and sweetly as I can at this point.\u00a0\n\n\u201cGoodnight Jason. Again, thank you for letting me stay here\u201d she says as I head to my room.\u00a0\n\nI lay in my bed, thinking about what she was describing until I fell asleep. Everything is peaceful until I hear a strained scream for help from my living room that jolts me up. I ran to the door, trying to get out but there was a force stopping it. I keep trying as the strained sobs come out until silence\u2026 My heart sinks, worried about what happened. I kicked in my door to see the most horrific sight this year. There, on the ground was Silvia's body but her head was on a stake pinned into the ground. Her eyes are crossed out and mouth sewn shut. I glance to my side, seeing the creature exactly as she described. A tall creature standing more around 7 \u20185 but had long-ass arms. Its eyes are so distorted and lifeless with an unsettling smile. It just stares at me, watching me. I stay still, watching it.\n\nAfter a minute, it moves but not toward me, just colouring on the wall with Silvia's blood. It finishes the message before looking at me again, silent but with a haunting smile. It then just walks off, climbing through my roof where it must have broken it. I stare at Silvia\u2019s body and head before looking at the message. I read it in horror as it said \u201cBroken for a false god, Lived for a lost cause\u201d. I tried my best to recreate it but nothing would be like seeing it in real life.\n\n**Chapter 2: What Now**\n\nI sat in the rain, the police in my house as I chatted to two other officers which seemed like they didn\u2019t care about the job much less Silvia\u2019s death. What the fuck? An innocent woman died by the hands of some type of monster! And they didn\u2019t care! They never cared for human life! Not when one dies!\u00a0\n\n\u201cSir, thank you for your time\u201d They said, walking away to their cars and driving with the evidence and the body, not even Silvia's bag. Like they care, they let me back in my now cleaned house they managed to clean within the hour. Well color me impressed. AT least they do something besides sit on their fat asses.\u00a0\n\nI pick up Silvia's backpack, throwing it to the side. I\u2019m too traumatised to really care of her possessions, only wanting to cry right now. I tried to tell them what really happened but they brushed it off, ignoring my claims like I did SIlvy\u2019s. Oh fuck, what have I done. No, what didn\u2019t I do? Why didn\u2019t I believe her, why couldn\u2019t I get past my thoughts and really help my friend cause it resulted in her death.\u00a0\n\nI threw my lamp against the wall in anger, it shattered but that was the last thing on my mind though. Everytime I closed my eyes, I saw her head on that stupid-ass stick and it\u2019s-it\u2019s smile haunting back at me. It\u2019s lifeless, distorted eyes staring at me. Just like, just- It was empty inside, like lifeless. But-I don\u2019t know even now.\u00a0\n\nI just lay in my bed, staring at the ceiling replaying every small, Minutia, detail I can recount. The \u201cHa, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha\u201d on the wall. What is a \u201cFalse God\u201d What \u201cLost Cause\u201d WHat does this mean? What does Silvia have to do with this? Why kill her? I thought this all through the night, trying to see if I could solve any of this\u00a0\n\n\u201cFalse God, False God, False God. Jesus?\u201d I mumble to myself, still scared but knowing it won\u2019t kill me if it didn't then and there. I still didn\u2019t even know what god? It sounds like an atheist monster but that still doesn\u2019t explain what \u201cLost Cause\u201d means? Does it just think believing in god is a lost cause? But why kill Silvy over it?\u00a0\n\nI get up, going to my computer to try and see if I can find anything about this thing I saw and what its motives are. I found little though, mainly things relating around this person called \u201cMark Zaning\u201d who died though there\u2019s not much information surrounding his death though I could find his facebook with weird ramblings. Tw stood out.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWrong! Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, g-g-go\u201d was the first message, his last. I don\u2019t know what this meant, why he was posting about gone and wrong. I tried to figure it out but couldn\u2019t. Along this rambling, he posted the picture of an eye. Pointy shaped eyes with a somewhat diamond looking pupil.\u00a0\n\n\u201cFalse Me He\u2019s Cause Lost Wrong God Ha, Ha, Ha\u201d read the other post which stood out to me because the word \u201cGod\u201d pops up again. So does \u201cFalse, Lost, Cause\u201d\u00a0 but what does this mean? It seems out of order but I can get it into anything really that makes sense to me. He posted this along with an image of a long, tall figure with\u2026 It\u2019s the figure from earlier. It\u2019s the figure I saw. I swear it is. It looked exactly like it. But it has the words \u201cHa, Ha, Ha, Ha\u201d Floating around his head. Why is this popping up over and over again! On the wall, in these notes, floating around the figure. Why does it say ha, why doesn\u2019t it laugh itself. It\u2019s not shown laughing.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe \u2014- yeah \u2014-- do \u2018bout him. \u2014----- We can\u2019t \u2014--- That leads \u2014--- us.\u201d I heard a guy mumbling outside. I look through my window, barely making out what he said. I stare at him, confused. HIs eyes widen at me as he sees me and starts walking away again. I start thinking about what he said, being paranoid about everything, Trying to pry at every single detail but I don't know why he was saying that directly outside of my house. I watch him walk away, very visibly having a gun in a holding unit. He doesn\u2019t say anything else nor looks back. I shrug it off, more worried about my research.\n\nI sit there, not really sure what to do with this information I have. I just think and replay the events over and over, not really letting myself mourn about what just happened a few hours ago. What does it mean, what \u201cFalse God\u201d, What was Mark talking about. I don\u2019t know, I just want to know at this point. Why can\u2019t I know?\n\nI hear a ding go off, I look over and see Silvia's bag where the ding came from. Must be her phone. I get up, not sure who would be texting her since she\u2019s really introverted nor does have many friends. She\u2019s single, maybe that's how we got a connection in the first place because we\u2019re similar in that manner. We\u2019re similar in the manner of being alone I guess.\u00a0\n\nI open the bag and I go through it for her phone. I reached the phone, seeing it was only a reddit notification so I put her phone in my pocket. It feels comforting having something of hers on me like this, like a part of her is here with me still. I take a deep breath, not letting my emotions take control of me but that\u2019s when I notice her notebook with weird looking pages. I pick it up, curious as I read through it slowly. I sit back, leaning against the wall and smiling at her creations. She loved drawing, especially animals. Looking through these images were pretty bittersweet. Looks like I\u2019m actually alone now\u2026\n\n\u201cWhat\u201d I mumble out to myself as I reach new pages of seeming rambling but\u2026 a few looked familiar. From Mark\u2019s page, the stupid word puzzles and the eye. And the \u201cwrong wrong\u201d thing. But also other things I didn't understand nor can be put into words. I feel even more confused after this.\u00a0\n\n**Chapter 3: The Eyes For God**\n\nI lean against the wall, staring at these images with Silvia\u2019s bag in my lap. I scroll through them over and over and over again to see if I can piece together what this means and why she has similar notes that Mark did. I take a closer look at each photo, before stopping at the \u201cGone, Wrong\u201d Page. I stare at it for a few seconds, trying to connect why there is a house and who's firing the gun at who? What does this have to do with anything? This is the second time the house has popped but why.\u00a0\n\nI fold the papers, not knowing what is happening anymore. My grasp of the understanding of how the world worked was lost last night when I saw that thing. That Monster! I drop the papers to the side, sighing as I do. I glance at Silvia's bag before searching through the rest of the bag.\u00a0\n\nI pull out what seems to be a hard drive with a paper taped to it. I grab the paper slowly, picking it up and searching every tiny detail of the picture.\n\n\u201cWatc(H)er, So Why DiDn\u2019t\u00a0**YOU?**\u201d I read aloud to myself. What does this mean? Is this directed towards me? But, how? The paper was deep in her bag, she clearly wrote it but she didn\u2019t know what happened at that point! Yes, I didn\u2019t watch her correctly and I failed, in turn killing her but she shouldn\u2019t have known that at that point! Who is this too!\n\nMy eyes scroll across the image going along with it. It\u2019s of an eye floating around what I can only guess is a mouth with sharp teeth in it. Many tiny eyes surrounding the creature. I go back to the notes I threw to the side because I remember seeing eyes and yes, each drawing with the house has eyes plus one that doesn\u2019t show anything of importance.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWatch Her, Watch Her, Watch-er, Watcher\u201d I repeat to myself, mind going berserk as I say this. Watcher, that god from that cult? I get off the ground, putting all the notes and stuff in the backpack and throwing it on my back. I go sit in my desk chair, searching \u201cWatcher\u201d at first but finding nothing. I sigh out of frustration but not going to give up \u201cWatch Cult\u201d is what I try next which shows nothing as well. Even after a few hours of trying to find something, I could only find one thing relating to the cult.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe Eyes For God is an organisation in which we worship and try to communicate with the god, Watcher. He watches over us and protects those who worship him. He is depicted as an eye in a mouth with sharp teeth though the community's symbol is just a sharper looking eye without the mouth nor the floating eyes around him. Reportedly, only one man has seen him with his own eyes who is the man who also designed the sketch of what we believe he looks like. His name is kept secret by the organisation.\u201d reads the only paragraph on the blank and empty website.\u00a0\n\nThat confirms a few things, that photo was of the Watcher and all of these or the ones with the symbol of the eye are connected to this cult in some way but that doesn\u2019t explain anyone else. What does Silvia have to do with this creature or cult? I mean, was she a part of this cult? Why would she be though?\u00a0\n\nI grab the photos from the bag, looking through them trying to make sense of any of this. What does the house have to do with this or what does that stupid word puzzle say? Is The Watcher who the creature is calling \u201cA False God\u201d but what does it mean by \u201clived for a lost cause?\u201d\u00a0\n\nThat's when I remembered I had that hard drive so I pulled it out of SIlvy\u2019s bag and plugged it into my computer. Immediately, the symbol popped up and my computer glitched out and shut down. When I turned the computer back on, it was normal. I pulled up the contents of the hard drive where there were only two things. The first was a link to a police website regarding the Cult. It was just a statement having nothing of substance.\n\n\u201cRegarding the disruptions The Eyes For God has caused, we are working to handle the situation of noise complaints all throughout the neighbourhoods. We are trying to minimize the effects this community is having on citizens and innocent lives.\u201d is all it read, nothing else really sitting on the website.\u00a0\n\nThe other thing was a call recording which glitched out my computer for a second before playing. The recording was about 20 minutes, a little over 18 minutes of it being static. I transcribed it after listening to it multiple times but I\u2019m still confused about what this conversation is really about.\n\n\u201cM\u201d I say aloud to myself.\u00a0 I presume that's who the silvy is talking to but who is m? We used to communicate with this guy named Marvin but I highly doubt thats him since he\u2019s in jail for rape. So who is it? Mark? Is it Mark? But why would they have contact with each other?\n\nThat\u2019s when my computer started to shake violently which concerned me. I tried to stop it but only ended up causing it to shake more. aAfter a minute, it stopped and nothing else happened. I stand there for a second, not sure what to do before I take the hard drive back into the bag. I do the same with all her notes and my notes as well.\u00a0\n\nI just sit there for a minute, mind racing as I close the bag. I close my eyes, trying to calm down a little as I hug the bag. Why did this happen to me? To Silvia. I miss SIlvia. I take a deep breath before opening my eyes, swearing I saw the long-armed creature again even though nothing is there. I know nothing is there, I know that but I can't get the creature out of my head! It feels like it\u2019s stalking me.\n\n\u201cStalking. It was Stalking Silvia before she came here\u201d I mumble to myself, now having an idea. I pack up my stuff, grabbing a gun before exiting my apartment. As I leave, I notice the same guy near the apartment again but i don\u2019t pay much mind to him. I have a mission now.\n\n**Chapter 4: Rest Forever**\n\nI walk down the street to the Graveyard, lost in thoughts. I keep the backpack on my back, it being mainly comforting. As I arrive, I make sure to take out the gun so, if it comes out, I\u2019ll shoot it. I stand there, gun pulled and looking around, paranoid. I look around, seeing absolutely nothing but I hear rustling which keeps me on guard. Slowly, I start to hear growling so I back up a step, trying to see what is going on over there. I forgot a Flashlight of course so I guess I\u2019ll have to use my phone which sucks.\u00a0\n\nThe rustling and growling gets louder and more constant now. I stood there, trying to see what it was when I jumped out straight to my face, making me jump, in turn making me fall down. It was just a raccoon though, running throughout the Graveyard.\n\nI stand up, trying to calm my racing heart as I stand back up, dusting myself off. I hold my arm in pain, relooking around the graveyard for anything new but there\u2019s nothing. Absolutely nothing again. I sigh, a mix between relief and annoyance as I pick up the gun. I stand there for another minute, thinking as I am unsure of what to do now.\u00a0\n\nI start to walk forward slowly and deliberately into the graveyard. I keep aware of my surroundings, gun tightly in my hand. I feel paranoid of them knowing something be stalking or watching my every, miniscule movement. I notice a grave with scratch marks on it, cutting through the stone. I crotch in front of it reading the Tombstone.\n\n\u201cMelina Interstuck. 1967 - 2005\u201d. I have nothing that leads to this nor does it seem important but it's huge cut is what confuses me. Maybe the Stalking creature could have done this. It\u2019s long and sharp-like fingers could\u2019ve done this but I\u2019m not really sure.\n\nI continue walking throughout the graveyard but I can't find anything at all. This was just a dead end. The Watcher nor the stalking creature are here. I feel like I\u2019m starting to hit a dead-end now.\u00a0\n\nI sit down near a tombstone, tired at this point and wishing I could have a minute without my thoughts running. Wishing everything would make sense. I take a deep breath, wishing none of this happened. I wish SIlvia was still here, I wish everything made sense.\u00a0\n\nI get up and I leave the Graveyard, nowhere closer to where I was before coming here. SIlvia must have been connected to this cult in some way but that doesn\u2019t explain what this stalking creature has to do with it. Really, only the eye and the cult connect with this creature being there as well.\u00a0\n\nI exit the graveyard, glancing back one more time trying to see something but still nothing. Why is there nothing now when there was something earlier? This is all confusing but there\u2019s nothing I can do about it now. I start to walk home with this in mind when I get a call from the police station. How nice, they must\u2019ve remembered they had jobs. I answer the call.\n\n\u201cYeah\u201d I say into the phone.\u00a0\n\n\u201cCome to the station so we can get your statement about Silvia\u2019s Topsin\u2019s death\u201d says the voice on the other end, cold.\n\n\u201cYeah, sure\u201d I responded, not even questioning the police\u2019s tactics anymore. The call ends as I start changing my direction into the one that leads to the station. I\u2019m pretty annoyed why they want a statement now but I should have seen it coming. As I was walking though, I noticed the same guy watching me. Now I\u2019m confused who this is.\n\nHe wears a dark grey jacket, black jeans, a hat with a hood who keeps his head down to avoid showing his face. He still has the gun holding slot with the gun as well and seems to be smoking now.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s going\u201d I hear him speak out to someone, seemingly being on a call. I can\u2019t help but think about what he meant about that though. Who are these guys? I arrive at the station, not excited for what comes next.\u00a0"},"94":{"title":"The plagues of old ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1gpuu5l\/the_plagues_of_old\/","flair":"Story","author":"matthewlaverty96","selftext":"I don't know how much I can tell you readers. How much he will let me tell you! I thought this was a gift, for so long I did what he asked of me. Every \u201cNew Material\u201d I brought him. Everytime he promised me a glimpse of paradise that he promised to take me too..\n\nIt must be nearly 700 years now since that time I took his \u201cGifts\u201d, from that time he first showed me paradise. Now it's my curse..My affliction.\n\nYou see I was first born in the 1300s, close to what you modern humans call \u201cKazakhstan\u201d. Life was basically living out of mud and wooden huts, eating what you kill\u2026 Growing what you could and hoping for the best.\n \nMy family was just my mother and sister, at the time my father was called off to some war for some  top warlord long forgotten in the history books. We spoke in a language I have long since forgotten, prayed to God's that have since been replaced and renamed time and time again -... But one thing has never changed, sickness and plagues. That's what took my family. I was nearly an adult when the sickness took them, first it started with a cough. Then you couldn't walk..then the fever. Then you can guess the final stage of it.\n\nThe elders and the healers couldn't do a thing, no matter how many times they prayed, no matter how many times they came up with a new elixir. It did nothing, so they reverted to the next best thing. Banishment or death, it was the only way to stop the spread and you tested your life to be seen coughing in front of them\u2026 lest your fate be chosen by a large wooden club.\n\nOnce my family died I tried to keep things running, but how could I? How could I hunt when all the animals either migrated or died of this sickness, any time you did eat it was a risk, die of the sickness or die of starvation. In my luck the former was what got to me, sitting In my rundown hut the roof showing signs of caving it, mud walls cracked and open to the elements, I began coughing. I coughed so hard that drops of blood were mixed into everything, my throat so dry and painful.\n\nI panicked, breathing fast and pacing back and forth, eyeing the lit torches of the village, knowing what waited for me if I stayed or showed my face. I ran, packing what little I had into my linen sack and I made for the mountains. In my haste or stupidity I hadn't taken a torch, so under only moonlight I crossed the ranges, harsh ragged breaths followed by the coughing, the noise must of putting a giant target over my head.\n\nAs I crossed one verge I could hear howling, I had also forgotten that there are much bigger predators out in the wilds and they are much..MUCH more hungry than I was. I started rushing towards a large hill in the distance, but as I rushed the louder the coughing got, I could hardly breathe as I reached it, my chest so tight I thought it was going to explode. \n\nAs I hugged the hill, slowly stepping as the howls got closer I found a cave, the opening just small enough I could squeeze my skinny frame through. I landed harshly with a thud, the air escaping my lungs,bring myself to me knees I started to pray, I begged the gods of old to take this torment from me, to finally relieve me of this pain and affliction, my prayer echoing off the walls of the pitch black cave. As I waited and waited for an answer, anything to give me guidance, a small faint glow came from the passage, a faint whisper beckoning me to come.\n\nI threw my hands up and praised the gods, they had finally answered me, one hacking cough later-..I made for the light, almost tripping as my eyes were fixed on this light. I made it to a tight point in the cave, as I squeezed through - cutting and scraping my arms and body in my desperation, I finally tumbled into the glow. Only\u2026it wasn't a glow at all where the tunneled opened up into a big open room, moss and condensation hung on to the walls (Quite unusual for the area, now thinking back on it) I noticed this sickly green mist flowing lowly across the floor of this room, that's when the smell hit me.\n\nI fell to the ground wrenching and heaving, painting the floor in all that was left in my stomach. It was like a thousand rotting corpses invaded my nose all at once. As the last bit of contents left my stomach I felt a pressure come over me, it was like I felt the danger closing in on me, as I quickly lifted my head, now coated in a cold sweat. I first laid eyes on him, from the center of the room I could see this figure, he was standing over a pot of sorts, smoke rising as if he was brewing something. \n\nAs if on cue, his head turned. As he did all I could hear was a painful cracking of bones almost as if they were rotted wood fighting a strong breeze. His eyes were dots, the pupils the same color as the mist. He turned to face me, as he did the room lit up, several carvings on the wall lighting with the same sickly green color. \n\nAs the light reached him more of his features exposed themselves, his clothes like rags, ripped and torn, his skin pulled tight against his frame and muscle, It appeared to be almost waxy and flaky. As his face was exposed by the twisted light I reeled back in shock and horror. The air escaped me once more as horse breaths heaved in and out of my lungs.\n\nHe was completely void of hair, his skin completely sunken in and sickly green, eyes like voids with green dots in the middle, almost like a skeleton with skin stuck to it. I kicked back in a panic trying to get to get to the edge of the wall, coughing and sputtering, trying anything to get away from this creature. \n\nAs I blinked it got closer and closer. I did only what I knew what to do and prayed, as the rotted foot landed beside me, I peered up with a whimper. The being letting out a scratchy gurgled sound almost as if it was talking to me, a sickened hand reached out as the being placed a hand on my forehead.\n\nAs I squeezed my eyes shut expecting for this creature to end me and take me for whatever gods know what but instead a voice invaded my head. It was deep and echoing but calming as it spoke\n\n\u201cOh child, you have suffered deeply, I can see that -.. such pain, anguish and sorrow, let me help you. Let me take all your troubles away\u2026Allow me to give you relief.\u201d\n\nAs I opened my eyes the cave was different, where the sickly mist was.. replaced with grass, ever so green and vibrant. The walls are decorated with flowers and sweet smelling plants. I looked up at the creature, where the green, bald and rotting skin was, it was replaced with a stunning figure. His skin full of life, his smile so inviting and warm.\n\nHe helped me to my feet, as confusion ran over my face, I noticed that I wasn't coughing anymore, and where my scraps and cuts were, the skin had healed and looked extremely healthy. The man smiled at me once more as the voice echoed in my head once more. \n\n\u201cYour family has joined me here too, they have accepted my gifts and now they live with me eternally, ever so happy and free from the woes of life\u201d\n\nAs he spoke he turned, his arm outstretched as if guiding me, leading me to my mother and sister sitting around his make-shift pot, they were smiling at me waving me over, as I sprinted full force towards them, embracing them in a hug, tears filling my eyes. They hugged me, their warmth was everything I had needed for the last few weeks. The man let out a hearty chuckle as he made his way to the pot, adding spices and herbs to it, using a massive stick to mix it.\n\n\u201cCome child, drink and accept my offerings. Take my gift and spread it to everyone, let them all rejoice in my splendor.\u201d\n\nMy mother laughed and my sister laughed with him, the voices echoing in my head \u201cDrink..yes..join us.\u201d Ringing over again as the man offered me a cup with the liquid. With a laugh and huff. I drank it.\n\nI awoke to rays of sunlight glancing off my face through cracks in the cave walls, everything seemed brighter, I felt amazing. So full of energy, though where the pot and moss was just a bear cave and small piles of rubble laying about.\n\nSpringing from the cave, I made it back to my village with speed, the clear air filling my lungs, my hut just as I left it. Looking at it with a huff, It left me with vigor as I began repairing the roof, getting new straw from the small storage hole we had. A smile wide across my face. \n\nThat night as I lay in bed, staring out at the moon lit sky, the voice echoed in my head \u201cTake my gift and spread it to everyone\u201d wondering how I could help everyone, make them all like me.\n\nThe next morning as I walked through the village I spotted a few of the women weaving baskets as they talked to each other though as I eyed one a strange feeling came over me, as a lump formed in my throat, my sister and mothers voice echoing in my head. \u201cYes, bring her to meet him to meet the Father.\u201d\n\n \u201cThe father?\u201d I thought, the man never told me his name, the confusion stricken across my face as It snapped me from my trance, the thought of bringing the young woman to the father never left my thoughts, almost like a nagging voice at the very back of my head. In Fact it kept me distracted for the rest of the day, before I knew it was night time once more as I lay in my bed, I tossed and turned the nagging and pleading to take that woman to him playing over and over. \n\nStanding up the next morning after tossing and turning all night, I looked into the small well of water in our hut, I could see my skin had begun to sink in a touch, my skin looking less vibrant,there was more of a grayish touch to my complexion. \n\nThe vigor I once felt now gone replaced with drowsiness and fatigue, though the nagging was now ever louder almost compelling me to do as it said, I felt like a zombie that day, staying mostly in my hut, though I kept finding myself to the open window staring down towards that woman as the pressure built in my head the nagging clutching itself to my every thought.\n\nThat night I didn't feel like myself, my breathing began to become loud and ragged as if I was falling back into my sickly state, I wanted to clear my head so I decided to go for a walk. The night seemed darker and more dull than the past few nights as the torches of the village kept a dull light across the dirt trails in front of me.\n\nMovement caught my eye as I turned to see the young lady from before. She was outside her hut cleaning and sorting Vegetables for the next morning, my hands trembling as the nagging voice reverberated at the back of my head \u201cLet her join us, let her have the gift\u201d. My legs started moving on their own as if i was a puppet, slowly I made my way up behind her, my hands wrapping around her neck as I began choking her, there was a silent struggle against the night, she was kicking her legs out frantically, clawing at my arms and trying to break free. But it wasn't enough as a raspy sigh of relief escaped my lips, in one sluggish movement I began dragging the unconscious girl towards the hills.\n\nAfter some time, I could finally feel myself able to control my limbs as I dropped the girl falling to my knees with exhaustion, the dark night silent and unforgiving, I closed my eyes, Internally I wished I just let the sickness take me and let me be at peace. \n\nBut I would soon learn I would never know peace again, a thud landed beside me. The father stood above me in his twisted form, the beady eyes scanning me, his lips crudely twisted into a cracked smile. A raspy, Crooked voice echoed in the back of my head.\n\n\u201cGood\u2026goooood, you have brought new materials for my gifts, you shall be rewarded handsomely, my child..keep up your work and you will never know hunger or sickness..\u201d\n\nI felt sick. The sight made my stomach drop and I knew I was under this twisted demon's control. The father made his way to the unconscious girl, with a flick of his wrist the make-shift pot appeared beside him, bubbling and popping with a disgusting ooze, the smell made me wretch as the father lifted the girl with an unseen force, as she was suspended above the pot. He lifted a rotted finger and at the tip a sickly green glow peaked out. With a small tap of her forehead it was like a wave of silence sprang out, all the nightlife fading out into nothingness\u2026\n\nBut it was the screams that still torment me to this day, the young girl screaming out as her body began to decay, her skin falling off in slops into the pot, not even her bones remained once he was done as the pot bubbled to life almost as if jumping with joy to relieve a meal.\n\nThe father turned to me..\u201dNow this girl has received my gifts..she has joined me in internal freedom. Her body will help bear fruit to one of my greatest gifts, go my child-. bring me more fruits, bring more to feed my creation\u201d \n\nJust as he had said this, he had vanished leaving that sickly green mist in his wake. The sounds of the night returning to me and where the pot had been now only remained rubble. The next morning some had questioned the woman's whereabouts but the elders argued that she had developed the sickness and her fate was in the hands of the gods..but I knew it was no gods that had brought her comfort only the demon.only the father.\n\nDays turned into weeks, every couple of days the compulsion took over me and I would bring the creature \u201cNew materials\u201d as he called it, each time the pot would get bigger and bigger until I was the only one left, though my health returned after each person, only to fade as I tried to resist his grasp of me.\n\nThe final night I took a villager to him, was the night everything changed, as the sludge slid into the pot, I felt almost numb knowing my situation was in the hands of the Father. He finally turned to me and with an amused smile on his lips, it was twisted and wrong\u2026\n\n\u201cIt is ready, oh what a beautiful creation my child..you shall spread my wonders to this world, everyone will receive My gifts\u201d\n\nThe pot stopped shaking all of a sudden and by this time it was nearly the size of a man, though an odd buzzing eventually came from it as the father raised his hands to the sky, from deep within the ooze a strange bug crawled from the top, twitching and buzzing around. Over time I learned it was called a \u201cFlea\u201d\n\n\u201cYes my child, you will take my gift and you will show this world how generous I truly am.\u201d \n\nThe father spoke with the raspy tone, like nails on a board, as the buzzing grew to a roar a wave of these bugs poured over the top of the pot and up into the sky almost like they were ready to block out the moonlit sky, I sat frozen in horror, this wave of bugs poured toward me as if given a silent command, as they swarmed over me it was hundreds of tiny legs clawing at me as I finally discovered their goal.\n\nThe first crawled into my mouth and down my throat-.. closely followed by another and another until the whole swarm wanted a place within me, my throat ached as my body twitched and I clawed at my throat the only thing that escaped my lips with a wet grunt and gurgle as if the swarm was choking me greatly, I expected to feel them to tear my body to shreds but I felt..at peace like they were always meant to be there.\n\nSoon the compulsion had me wandering southwards towards the port towns. I had never seen a boat or anything like it, the smell of sea air for the first time but that was not my purpose. The compulsion I was under only wanted one thing: \u201cSpread the gift, infect the world\u201d. Finding a lonely corner street-. My body began to violently shake, feeling those tiny bugs forcing their way from within, as the wet gurgling left me once more.. Forcing me on my hands and knees. More spewing out until every last bug left me, they scuttled off looking for places to infect, from what I learned they jumped from rat to rat forcing them to be killed by predators, smart wee creatures.\n\nThat my dear reader is how I was the person who spread what you came to call \u201cThe black plague\u201d. For over 10 years I watched as the plague took my home land then on to the new world..England and France, causing so many deaths while I remained healthy and whole. The father left me alone for that time, happy with the chaos I was forced to spread. For 10 years I was able to remain whole and free to do as I wished. It was fun really, traveling to other countries learning new ways of living and dialects,  I traveled as a hermit staying in one place for a while watching your plague doctors try and fail to heal your ancestors. Then I would travel on once more. No need for food or rest, on the dawn of a new day I was like a new man, able to travel without question or reason.\n\nBut you humans had to go and ruin it for me, soon you came up with \u201cQuarantine\u201d keeping the sick with the sick, isolating the plague so it couldn't spread. I was in the land you would later call Spain. That's when I met him again, walking the trails as I made my way to the sea, The deep raspy voice echoed in my head as I cried out, thinking I had once and for all been freed.\n\n\u201cMy child, your kin has found a way to stop my gift from spreading, it seems we need new materials, a better gift, one that won't be easy to stop.\u201d\n\nSo that's what I did, for hundreds of years I would explore new lands, stealing innocent people for his twisted oozes. Stories and fables warning kids of the body snatcher came about, warning people of me but the amount of people I was forced to bring him, each new disease you managed to stop it, each time you all forced me to bring him more and more materials. \n\nThere was a time, close to the 1700s, that I tried to resist him. Oh I tried, no matter how run down and pale I looked\u2026 I resisted his call, resisted his compulsion. That was until my fingers began to fall off and the pain I was put in was unbearable, have you ever tried rotting from the inside out and not being able to die from it? \nNo? I thought so, so don't blame me for giving In.\n\nThough I do have to give it to you humans, over my many years I have seen the wonders of development and advancement, though you have made my job A LOT harder, but you have also helped me in some ways all the war and drought, all the times you left the homeless to perish. It did feed him for a while , kept him off my back for a few years as he picked away at the rotting dead you left on the battle fields or the mass graves. Seriously you really did not care for your dead at times, no last rites\u2026just pain and rot.\n\nYou may have seen some of our more recent works, the Spanish plague..polio..Ebola every couple of years he would force me to spread a new plague. Forcing me to watch as you all withered into the dirt. But in the much recent years you all had to deal with that \u201cCovid 19\u201d you all talk about, Yeah that was all me.\n\nThat one was easier to get the materials for, after all in China people go missing all time and not one word said about it, that communist party really does not care for the wellbeing of its people and to be honest\u2026. You chinese really like eating bats and rats, all it took was spewing ooze down a few rats mouths and the game was on. The one thing that did get to me though-.. Learning the language, that really took me some time to nail down, every region has some new dialect, some new way of saying the same word. \n\nI did learn one thing during my years on this planet, the father..He is actually a God believe it or not\u2026born from chaos, one of those old gods pagans used to fear. Tricking people into thinking he cares about them, then getting them to do his bidding, promising you everything under the sun as long as you help him brew every plague, disease and sickness you can think about, over time he called us his \u201cHarbingers\u201d or his \u201cChildren\u201d.\n\nAs you may have guessed, I'm not the only one, there's several of us. Each one with their own territory, as one leaves for the next place-..we all move. Never in the same place at one time\u2026maximum coverage..\n\nBefore I came into the fold, he was only able to pull off small plagues, targeting small run down areas. That was easy for him, in my time there were no medical advancements, the best we did was pray to Gods and drink a cocktail of herbs and fruits, but the fathers ambitions grew to great-.. He was too hungry for just a small village here or there, he always craves more.\n\nThough I'm just rambling on what I consider my final thoughts, it was nice to get this off my chest even though you can't talk back to me, it was comforting\u2026writing this all down..but the improvement in your technology, it's getting so hard for me to get the materials the Father requires, you have cameras everywhere watching everything, how do you call that freedom?\u2026Every day I am in so much pain, rotting away more and more, right now my hand fell off just this morning..my skin with large sores and holes everywhere, I don't think I can much do this for much longer, seems like I have finally served my usefulness...it's ironic but seems like I'll be in your next disease, maybe I'll find some rest but who knows? Catch you all later! He is calling for me\u2026\n\nOh just remember..never trust a man offering you strange gifts..There is always a price to pay!\n\n\n\n"},"95":{"title":"Changing Lights PT. 1","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1gpxjaw\/changing_lights_pt_1\/","flair":"Story","author":"ZealousidealYam4891","selftext":"I.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cNo, no, no, no!\u201d A man screamed as he ran down a jagged, declining hill. Fog hovered above the wet and soggy ground. His heavy footfalls sent mud flying behind him. Labored pants from struggling lungs mixed with the burning of his leg muscles. A shout escaped his lips as his left foot slammed into a rock, sending him tumbling. \u201cShit!\u201d He started to roll, hitting everything possible and leaving him bruised and battered. When the slope of the hill reached a flat plane, the rolling stopped and the man was on his stomach. With a sore body and a few groans, he was able to lift himself up onto his feet. He rubbed the aching areas of his body and wiped the muck from his face. \u201cWhere'd it go?\u201d The man asked out loud as he looked up towards the night sky. Stars glittering through the thin purple clouds. A low humming began to echo behind him, the ground rumbled under his feet. \u201cOh no.\u201d The words came out with a struggling gasp of air. He started to run again but he didn't go anywhere. His legs stung from the effort and his feet were in motion but suspended above the ground. A faint green glow slowly brightened, eventually illuminating the man in a matter of seconds. \u201cOh God. Please let me go!!\u201d The light intensified and it began to sear the man's flesh. Lacerations and boils burst from the surface of his skin, causing blood and mucus to run out through the dermis. Screams of pain drowned out the low humming from the single beam of light that encased around him. With a final cry of pure agony, the man shot up towards the sky. The light disappeared, a soft gust of air above whistled and the night returned to a calm, sleepy undertone.\n\u00a0\n \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOoooh Lerooyyy. Wake yer ass uuuuup.\u201d Boomer beckoned to his friend in a musical tone filled with ear piercing notes. The bedroom window of the rusty blue trailer was open, a box fan wedged in the space. The sound of Boomer\u2019s voice gave a Darth Vader-esque sound that stung Leroy's ear drums. He rolled over, facing the fan and mumbled to his friend. \u201cFive more minutes, Boom.\u201d Leroy's eyes felt like they were glued shut and he was so comfortable in his bed that his body was just an extension of the mattress.\n\u00a0\n \u00a0\u00a0 Boomer disturbed the peace by letting out his normal, baritone voice. \u201cNo can do shit stain. You agreed to help me shear my sheep this mornin\u2019.\u201d The night before, Boomer and Leroy went out drinking and Leroy ended up receiving an oral gift from Tammy the Tank. See, Leroy was in a serious relationship with Suzy Mae but on his end, he wasn't all that serious. Suzy Mae wanted marriage and children where Leroy just wanted the title of being her man. Unfortunately, Leroy was a loose cannon and not the most loyal. Well that's not entirely true, he was flawlessly loyal to his oldest friend Boomer. But anyone beyond that, he would tend to be caught showing his lack of consistency. \n\u00a0\n \u00a0\u00a0 To make a long story short, the two friends had been gulping\u00a0 down shots of Haggard Harry's cheap whiskey. Leroy got an itch that needed to be scratched. He had been making sarcastic jokes with the bartender, Tammy. A large woman of great physique.\u00a0 An estimated height of six foot and three inches, three hundred pounds with arms as big as Hulk Hogan. Hence her nickname, Tammy the Tank. She had the face of a bulldog mixed with an alpaca, crooked teeth and all. She also snorted when she laughed and pronounced every \u201cS\u201d with \u201cTH\u201d. Anyway, the jokes that were being told went one way with Leroy and another way with Tammy.\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \u00a0 For Leroy, saying things like, \u201cGod damn! I'm in love with your smile.\u201d Or \u201cI wonder if a small thing like you could handle all of this.\u201d while gesturing at his frame; were jabs at the woman's appearance. However for Tammy the Tank, she thought this scrawny redneck was flirting with her. Boomer watched while holding back his laughter because he had a feeling the woman wasn't taking it like his friend assumed. Fast forward a few hours and eighty dollars later and Tammy offered the inebriated Leroy a mouth hug. \n\u00a0\n \u00a0\u00a0 When Leroy Addlar gets to a certain point of intoxication, there's an extra aspect of him that comes out. Not to beat around the bush here but also trying to be somewhat modest, the man becomes easily aroused. So the combination of whiskey and the jokes that were mistaken as advances, Leroy hopped up and allowed the Amazonian to lead him towards the kitchen area behind the bar. Boomer just sat at his stool, taking another shot and finally busting out laughing. \n\u00a0\n \u00a0 This is where Suzy Mae comes into the situation. As stated before, Leroy was in a relationship with her at the time of the event. Suzy ended up coming to the bar to see if Leroy was there because he had drunkenly forgotten about their dinner plans. When Boomer noticed her arrival he began to slightly panic. Boomer hated how Leroy treated Suzy Mae for two reasons. One being that his heart was three times too big, leaving him with a heavy conscience about things. Two would be that he had always had a crush on her ever since kindergarten. But even with those things weighing on him, Boomer couldn't betray his best friend. So instead he rose from his stool, stumbling a bit from the alcohol and crept towards the back of the bar. He could hear the bell alarm of the entrance door behind him so the walking turned into a very goofy looking speed jog.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 As he approached the back, Boomer could hear Leroy. \u201cGood god dayum woman, you could suck a golf ball through a garden hose!\u201d Boomer rolled his eyes as he cracked the door open to yell at his friend. Some moaning from Leroy and humming from Tammy the Tank below, filled his ears. Boomer called out in a tone that was both cautious and firm. \u201cLeroy! Suzy Mae just walked in.\u201d The extra noise from Boomer's voice sent a jolt of surprise to Leroy and he jumped which caused the humming woman on her knees to make a sound that kind of sounded like a Billy goat.\nLeroy spoke with annoyance in his slightly gasping voice. \u201cOh hell. Boomer cover for me man. Please?\u201d Tammy paused her current action to join in with her two cents but was stopped before she could utter a word. Guided back to position by Leroy's hand as he pleaded with Boomer. \u201cC'mon man. I need five minutes. I'll-I'll do anything.\u201d His gargantuan friend raised an eyebrow then sighed. Boomer rolled his eyes. \u201cTomorrow mornin\u2019 you're helpin me shear sheep. Six a.m. sharp.\u201d Leroy nodded in agreement while dismissing Boomer with the wave of his hand. The door closed and Boomer felt the sting of guilt hit his gut as he sat back down and waited for Suzy Mae to approach him.\n\u00a0\n \u00a0\u00a0 She did soon come and talk to him, asking for Leroy. Boomer did his best to remain nonchalant and lied through his teeth. He didn't go out of his way to tell a fabrication of Leroy not being at the bar or anything like that. Simply told her he was currently in the midst of blowing up the toilet from a case of too many cheap bar chili bowls and jalape\u00f1os poppers. \u201cGood god. That man eats like a pig and yet he's as skinny as a rail. I don't get it, Boomy.\u201d Suzy Mae's soft voice tickled Boomer\u2019s ears and his heart raced a bit. He always felt that way when she called him \u201cBoomy\u201d. He shook away the butterflies in his stomach. \u201cI'll go let him know to wipe up and get out here for ya.\u201d He sat up and walked towards the corner of the bar. Luckily the bathroom was on the same side as the door which led to the greasy kitchen where Leroy was engaging in his not so subtle infidelity. \n\u00a0\n \u00a0 \u00a0 Boomer slowly opened the door to accidentally see his friend exposed but only for a brief moment. With a quick pull up of the denim and a zip, the horrible sight of the sad excuse for pork sausage was gone and Leroy shamefully gazed at Boomer. \u201cShit man. How \u2018bout knockin\u2019 next time. You had me full frontal.\u201d Tammy the Tank wiped her mouth and strolled past the men but not before thanking Leroy with a kiss that made Boomer\u2019s stomach turn. He shifted over to let the hulking woman leave then exhaled in disappointment. \u201cI told Suzy Mae you had a case of the shits. Now get your ass out here and complain about your stomach.\u201d\u00a0 The two men strolled out together with Leroy thanking Boomer with a whisper.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u00a0 Leroy spent the rest of the night pretending to be sick and doing his best to not make eye contact with the bartender who had, hours earlier, given him the sloppy toppy. Boomer swallowed the sour taste of dishonesty as he conversed with his companions. When the clock struck twelve, they paid their tab and exited the bar. Boomer caught Tammy the Tank giving Leroy a poor attempt at a wink. It resembled what you see frogs do when they try to re-wet their bulbous occulars. A giant ball squishing back behind the eyelids then followed by the other. It just looked like she blinked but with the left eye being delayed by about three seconds. He shook his head as he walked past, opening the door for Leroy and Suzy Mae. They said their goodbyes and Boomer reminded his friend about helping with the sheep. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u00a0 \u00a0 And that was what led to the current events of this morning. Unfortunately,\u00a0 Leroy was up until almost three, drinking more and receiving a second mouth hug\u00a0 from Suzy Mae, leaving him dead tired. It was now six and Boomer was relentless with his attempts at getting the hungover prick out of bed.\u00a0 \u201cBetter get up before the rain starts.\u201d Boomer announced as he placed a dirty bucket in front of himself, lining it up with the window he was yelling through. He continued pestering Leroy as he stood on it and began undoing his belt. \u201cIt's getting cloudy out here. Rain is definitely on its way. Be a shame if it leaked through your winder.\u201d The tone was a sarcastic and childish one that was driving the slumbering Leroy crazy. He wrapped his pillow around his ears to muffle Boomer's thundering voice. As he did this, morning crust filled Leroy's nostrils which forced him to begin breathing through his mouth. A chuckle echoed through the vortex of the fan followed by another loud announcement of the weather.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n \u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAaaaaannnnd\u2026\u2026here comes the rain, fucker!\u201d Boomer smiled as he pulled out his manhood, releasing a heavy and potent stream of urine. He aimed it directly at the fan which inhaled the pungent liquid, sending a drizzle to fly towards Leroy's face. At first it didn't phase him but that changed when the smell of ammonia and asparagus hit his nose and a few drops landed on his tongue. The assault sent the man bolting upright and holding his pillow as a shield from the slowly dissipating onslaught of piss. He screamed in an angry but groggy manner. \u201cYou motherfucker! It got in my mouth!\u201d Boomer howled with laughter as he zipped his fly. Gut wrenching sounds of gagging wafted through the window. The fan distorted the noise,\u00a0 creating an inhuman sound of something dying. \n\u00a0 \u00a0\n \u00a0 After around forty five minutes of trying to remove the taste and smell of urine from himself, Leroy busted out of the trailer. \u201cFuckin cocksucker!!\u201d He shouted as he ran towards his friend with a baseball bat in his hands. He swung it at the giant frame of a man but slipped on a fresh pile of dog shit and landed on his back. Boomer let out a rumbling chime of laughter while kneeling down to pet the stray dog that had been roaming around Leroy's for the past week. \u201cLook at that girl, you saved me from an attack. Good dog.\u201d The mangy lab wagged her tail in appreciation as she accepted the scratching between her ears. Leroy lay stunned, gasping for breath from the fall and realizing the bat was no longer in his hands. During this short chain of events, it had left his hands and went flying towards the sky. It tumbled back to earth and Leroy watched it fall. Unable to react fast enough, he let out an elongated \u201cshiiiiiiiit\u201d as the wooden sports paraphernalia landed smack down onto his crotch.\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh fuck me running!! Why? Why god?!\u201d Leroy grabbed his unmentionables while squirming in pain. His pants legs smearing the canine stink patty into the denim. He continued in this fashion for a good five minutes before finally being able to stand up. \u201cYou're an asshole.\u201d The stare he gave Boomer could shoot straight through concrete, fueled with so much anger. The two friends stood there in a staring contest for a while, leaving the stray dog sitting in confusion. Soon she grew bored and ran off to go chase a nocturnally impaired possum that caught her eye. \n\u00a0\n \u00a0 \u201cHey bud, don't blame me for the hangover or the fact that your nuts are swollen and ya smell like dog shit.\u201d Boomer couldn't help but chuckle at the statement. He was rather enjoying himself with all the series of bad luck his friend received. He considered it karma for last night's poor choices. Leroy stared at him longer until a swarm of gnats surrounded him and some flies started to eat the drying excrement at the ends of his jeans. He took a deep breath through his nose. A large glob of mucus shot down his throat, accompanied by four or five gnats. The taste and texture of the insects made the man gag and soon his eyes watered then a bit of vomit flew out of his mouth. \u201cGod damnit. Ain't I suffered enough? You piss on me. I slip on a pile of shit. Get a bat to the stones and now I just sucked up fuckin\u2019 bugs. Why does the world hate me? What the hell did I do?\u201d Before Boomer could answer the rhetorical question, Leroy raised a finger to keep his friend silent. \u201cWait. What did I do? What happened last night? I know we met at the bar and Suzy Mae took me home. Everything in betweens foggy.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 Boomer held a\u00a0 huge smile on his face while shaking his head. \u201cWhut?\u201d Leroy asked while mispronouncing the word. Boomer spat with a cacophony of giggles and it was eating at Leroy's patience. If you haven't figured it out but now, Boomer finds humor in a lot of things and will never stray from enjoying a good laugh. \u201cWhat the fuck is so dayum funny? What happened asshole?\u201d It took some time before Boomer could take a break from laughing in order to answer the question. He squinted at his friend and finally spoke. \u201cTammy.\u201d One word and Leroy furrowed his brow in confusion.\u00a0 \u201cTammy?\u201d The question hung in the air like a stale fart, refusing to leave a cramped room. Boomer blinked and repeated himself. Leroy paused for a while until recognition took hold. \u201cTammy the Tank?\u201d His paranoia kicked in as he prayed internally that they were not speaking about the same person. But that wasn't the case when Boomer confirmed it. He pointed at Leroy and spoke, \u201cTammy. The. Tank.\u201d Then he made a gagging sound while pretending to shove something down his throat with the other hand that wasn't pointing at Leroy.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u00a0 \u201cYer fuckin\u2019 wit me. No, no no no no no. I didn't.\u201d Leroy became flustered and it got worse when Boomer replied. \u201cOh yes you did. On her knees for ya in the kitchen. I seent it.\u201d Boomer's face was turning red and a large shit eating grin began to hurt the corners of his mouth. \u201cFuuuuck! Oh God. Why'd you let me do that?!\u201d The frustration spewed out with Leroy's words which made the whole situation ten times funnier. After crying from laughter, Boomer explained the events of the night before and the deal that had been struck. Leroy dipped his head in shame. Not feeling this way about cheating on Suzy Mae but doing the act with Tammy the Tank. Clearly the alcohol had betrayed him and now he was disappointed in himself. He wiped sweat from his forehead, put a large wad of skoal in his lip before speaking up. \u201cWelp. I\u2019m fuckin done with whiskey. Let's get this shearing done so I can drown my shame in a few cases of keystone light.\u201d Boomer agreed with a grunt and the two strolled towards his truck and headed out.\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n \u00a0 The act of shearing sheep is not an easy task when it's ninety five degrees outside, you're hungover and the sheep constantly use their hind legs to kick you in the shin. To make matters worse, having your behemoth of a friend make fun of all your attempts without offering any intervention, tends to make you wanna shear off his beard instead. \u201cHow \u2018bout you lend a hand instead of howlin\u2019 like a damn hyena, prick.\u201d The words didn't stop the laughter echoing from Boomer's mouth but it did make him calm down a bit.\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 There were a total of twenty sheep and it had taken three hours to shear the first four. This was gonna take all day to do and regret was rearing its prominent head to the surface. Obviously Leroy had a bit of anger bubbling up,\u00a0 this was accompanied by a bubbling in his gut as well. \u201cOh man. I need you to take over.\u201d He clinched up and waddled away before Boomer could even respond. The continuous release of gas made Leroy sound like a choir of toads catcalling during mating season. His steps were short and the movement of his legs were swiveled as he held his lower half with both hands. \u201cShiiit. Hold on, hold on. We're almost there, please don't-\u201d The words stopped and were replaced by a sound that could only be compared to a trumpet being blown in a sink full of water. Leroy stopped right there and yelled towards the heavens. \u201cGod damnit! Why have I been forsaken?!\u201d A gust of wind picked up, blowing grains of dirt towards Boomer's location. It had also snatched up the methane from Leroy's ass cannon which in turn invaded Boomer's sense of smell. He waved the stench from his face but I did not help and he had to run away, leaving a half shaved sheep trapped to bask in the lethal cloud. \n\u00a0 \u00a0\n \u00a0 Leroy grumbled and cursed as he continued his waddle towards Boomer's log cabin. The cabin as well as the farm had been passed down to Boomer from his late father. The place had stood for six generations and was built by his ancestors. It was once used for cattle but as time went on, the line of Boomer\u2019s family had become cheap and lazy. Hence why it now housed the twenty sheep whose only purpose in life was to eat, shit and grow their thick coats to be sheared. In terms of finances, Boomer was more successful than Leroy. Not by a lot but let's just say that the yearly salary of a sheep farmer is at least double that compared to unemployment. \n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n Leroy did not work on account that he was fired from his last job at Wacky Wilbur's bar and grill. When you get caught blowing snot rockets into a customer's Almighty Angus Burger, you tend to not last very long. Even when the reasoning for the act is in your opinion justified for claiming that Chevy is better than Ford. The customer became dumbfounded when Leroy explained that it stood for \u201cFucked Over Rebuilt Dodge\u201d Clearly the sixty year old pastor had never been spoken to like that before and he damn near had a heart attack when Leroy called him a \u201cliver spotted cum guzzlin pigeon fucker\u201d That was his fourth day on the job. The only saving grace that prevented Leroy from poverty was Suzy Mae. She not only paid for his beer and groceries but she also worked at the welfare office. When he lost his job, she had managed to intercept his claim and forged the information needed to set him up with a weekly payment that could sustain him.\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 When the air cleared, Boomer walked back to the now woozy sheep and finished the removal of its coat. No kicks or squirms of defiance came from the animal as he did it. Some farmers have a special table used to strap down the livestock but Boomer didn't like that tactic. His immensely sized heart found it cruel, so he just attached a leash to a collar around their neck and tied one end up to a pole. It was a cruel free system and the creature's were happier than hell about it. He had sheared a total of nine sheep by the time Leroy had made his way back. \u201cYou good over there shit stain Wayne?\u201d Boomer huffed as he removed the last bits of sheep fur. Leroy sat down on an upturned milk crate cautiously. \u201cFuck you.\u201d He defensively snapped back. He leaned against the pole used to keep the sheep stationary and placed a hand over his stomach. \u201cWhat the hell did I eat? Done shit myself while wearing my good boxers, had to cut a hole out of em.\u201d Boomer leashed the next sheep and blinked rapidly. \u201cYou did what?\u201d He had to make sure he heard his friend correctly. \n\u00a0 \u00a0\n \u00a0 \u201cI said I had to cut a hole out my new boxers. You fuckin deaf?\u201d Boomer cackled. \u201cSo you're still wearing shit covered drawers?\u201d Leroy rolled his eyes and spat, creating a huge pool of chew spit on the ground. \u201cNo dickhead. I used my pocket knife to cut the dirty bits out and put em back on.\u201d Boomer shook his head as he continued with the next sheep. He kept glancing inquisitive stares at his friend, holding back both laughter and curiosity. Leroy caught the glances and spoke up. \u201cWhat?!\u201d He could feel more grumbling in his stomach and started to pray another spurt of chocolate sauce wasn't about to shoot from below. He clenched up and gripped his knees. \u201cGod damn. Please, not again.\u201d Boomer cracked a smile, his face beat red as he held in a laugh. Leroy took a deep breath and relaxed his tense body. He turned his attention back to his friend, seeing his eyes darting between the half shaven sheep and himself. He sneered as he yelled at Boomer. \u201cWhat the fuck is you lookin at?!\u201d His friend finally released the suppressed chuckle then his face turned inquisitive. \u201cLeroy, I gotta ask. Why did you cut a hole in your boxer?\u201d The question hung in the air for a while, the sheep gave its opinion on the matter but there was no animal translator nearby to decipher their native tongue.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n \u201cI already told you. So I could put them back on without having to deal with a grease stain of shit.\u201d Leroy was clearly frustrated with the question. Boomer shook his head again and pinched the skin between his eyes. \u201cBut why?\u201d He struggled to understand the point. Leroy exhaled loudly and spat, hitting a pair of flies fornicating on his boot. \u201cSo I could put them back on, dumbass. Why else?\u201d The miscommunication between the two friends was creating tension. Just then a bird flew by to witness the awkward scene and launched a slimy white and brown bomb, landing on Leroy's hat. He shot up and screamed at the flying terrorist. \u201cCocksucking motherfucker! You little bastard, this is my good hat.\u201d He gripped the bill of the Dale Earnhardt hat and slammed it against the dirt. He hoped the dust would dry out the shit and the Nascar memorabilia could be saved. After this, Boomer asked another question on the subject of the soiled undergarment. \u201cWhy wouldn't you throw those things away and just freeball?\u201d Still struggling to comprehend his friend's odd decision.\n\u00a0 \n\u00a0 \u00a0 Leroy wiped his hat against a patch of crabgrass then examined it to see if there were any remnants of bird shit. A faded white speck remained, he shrugged his shoulders and placed it back on his head. He scratched the scruff of his chin and pushed his long greasy hair behind his ears before answering. \u201cTwo reasons. One, these are a gift from Suzy Mae for our six month anniversary. Two, my balls hang too low and I don't want them rubbing up against my thighs. I ain't tryin to chafe in this damn heat.\u201d Boomer shuttered at the mental image of two hairy flesh marbles smacking against scrawny legs. \u201cFuck me. I didn't need to know number two.\u201d He let out a belch and released a freshly sheared sheep. \u201cThen don't ask stupid questions, dummy.\u201d Leroy's comment was harsh and Boomer decided it was time to switch. \u201cAlright mud muffin, it's your turn.\u201d They exchanged positions and spent the rest of the day cracking jokes and creating fucked up hair styles on the sheep.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u00a0 Night crept up and brought a cool breeze as Boomer and Leroy sat by a large fire. A can of beer in their hands, one man with a cigarette between two fingers and the other pinching a scrotum itch between his. \u201cI can't believe you let Tammy the Tank gobble your knob.\u201d Boomer spoke into his can as he drained the last bit of foamy piss water. \u201cShut the fuck up. I'm trying to drink that mistake away. Thank fuck I don't remember it.\u201d Leroy shivered a bit, crushing an empty can and tossing it into the fire. \u201cYea well, I'll never forget it. She thucked you real good.\u201d Boomer cackled after attempting to mimic the poor bartender's speech impediment. When his beer emptied, he felt bad that he had just made fun of the woman.\u00a0 Leroy\u2019s high pitched twang broke the big man's contemplation of regret. \u201cYou can kiss my hairy ass, Captain Cuntbag.\u201d This lightened the mood and the men both looked at each other and laughed.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u00a0\u00a0 When the last of the alcohol induced chuckles died down, a faint light in the sky caught their attention. A long streak of red that faded into yellow darted off towards the earth's surface, leaving a faint trail of blue and green. Soon questions were asked about life outside of their world. Leroy had zero belief where Boomer had slight belief. He didn't wear tin foil on his head or think there were aliens among us. But he knew that life on earth couldn't be the only things out in the vast expanse of the solar system. Leroy made fun of him for this. \u201cYou fuckin dipshit. You think aliens are real? Little Green fuckers in flying plates?\u201d Boomer rolled his eyes. \u201cIt's flying saucers you dumbass. And I didn't say I believe in little green men, just said we can't be the only life out there.\u201d This turned into a debate and Leroy's side was chalk full of incomprehensible bullshit that no one on Earth or Mars could understand. If you argued long enough with Leroy, you'd find out that he thought the earth was an egg and chemtrails made frogs turn gay. But he would need to be inebriated to let these beliefs surface.\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 By the end of the thirty pack of keystone light, the men were too drunk to debate anymore and Boomer drove Leroy home. He thought he saw that multi color light again while driving and focused his gaze at the sky. Leroy screamed at him to stop but it was too late. A loud crash and the truck came to a complete stop. \u201cAh shit man. You hit my home!\u201d Boomer ignored Leroy's expression and burped while speaking.\u00a0 \u00a0 \n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cYou\u2026..*belch*\u2026..mean, mobile home.\u201d He chuckled and pulled out a cigarette, lighting the wrong end but inhaling it without noticing. Leroy scolded the wobbling giant. \u201cIt don't matter what it's called. That's where I live, you dingleberry. Now you owe me!\u201d The two drunken idiots argued for a while, catching the attention of the stray dog who had no name. Well actually, her name was Kalido but that was in her native canine language, the humans she looked after were not aware of this. The skinny one called her \u201cshit mongrel\u201d and \u201cfucker\u201d while the big one called her \u201cGood dog\u201d and \u201cpretty girl. She watched the humans attempt battle and it ended with both of them falling, crying then hugging. The big one departed in his metal box with wheels and the skinny one went inside his long rusty rectangle. Kalido sniffed the air and smelled danger. She looked up at the sky, seeing a bright object and scampered through the woods to find safety.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 "},"96":{"title":"The Bubak","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1gpqpo3\/the_bubak\/","flair":"Story","author":"hyylt","selftext":"Strange reports of a discarded stick figure began circulating in the community, prompting local authorities to urge residents to secure their homes. Some locals speculated that the figure was a Bubak, a folkloric creature, but the police dismissed these claims. For Sui, a devoted single father, the safety of his two children was paramount. He couldn't risk them encountering either a psychotic person dressed as a stick figure or, worse, something out of a frightening folklore that could harm them. Each night, before dinner and bedtime, he made it a point to engage them in discussions about their day at school. Their conversations typically revolved around the usual routine\u2014homework assignments, teachers giving too many instructions, and the occasional school fight. Thankfully, there was never anything concerning, which provided Sui with a sense of relief. However, he remained vigilant about their safety.\n\nEvery morning, as he dropped them off at school, Sui stressed the importance of heading straight home afterward and insisted they never open the door for anyone. His worry grew, fueled by the news reports he had been hearing. One night, while having dinner, an unsettling sound broke through their usual routine. The distinct sound of a baby crying echoed from the back of the house. At first, they ignored it, assuming it was a neighbor's child; after all, they lived in an apartment with many other families, and such noises were common. However, this particular sound was persistent and seemed to draw closer.Feeling a rush of unease, Sui told his children to go to their room and stay there while he investigated. Slowly, he made his way toward the source of the crying, which seemed to be coming from the balcony.\n\nAs he stepped outside into the dim light, he spotted what looked like an old scarecrow propped against a worn-out bag. Intrigued, he approached it for a better look, his heart racing. But before he could register what was happening, the strange figure lunged at him. It coiled around Sui with a speed and force he couldn't comprehend before dismembering him in a horrifying frenzy. Later, when the children grew curious about why their father had been gone for so long, they ventured through the house to find him. Instead, they were met with a sight that would haunt them forever; blood stained the ground, and they screamed for help, their innocence shattered in that terrifying moment.\n\nFor more stories check out my blog \n>> https:\/\/jztstory.blogspot.com\/?m=1\n>> https:\/\/jztstory.blogspot.com\/?m=1"},"97":{"title":"New Security Cameras Didn't Catch What Killed My Coworkers","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1gpc9k3\/new_security_cameras_didnt_catch_what_killed_my\/","flair":"Story","author":"dlschindler","selftext":"Storytelling isn't something that I am good at, although my anthropology professor confidently stated that all humans are natural-born storytellers. I've always felt that such statements must be inherently incorrect. It would be like saying that all humans naturally love their mother and father. Ridiculous.\n\nIt is when we share an experience unique to our individual life that we suddenly become this great storyteller - and only because the audience says so, not because any particular story is objectively well told. As someone with a philosopher's degree in library science, I intimately know all the classics, and I can assure you that they are entirely overrated, except Elvira by Giuseppe Folliero de Luna - that book is actually objectively flawless. Everybody has read that book and agrees it is second only to the King James Bible in its contribution to bookshelves. I'm just kidding, I know you haven't read Elvira and you probably wouldn't appreciate it the same way I did. That's called 'subjectivity', because it is subject to my opinion, instead of the object obviously being of universal observation (objective).\n\nHumans, we all agree, are especially mischievous. Telling each other stories is probably the most useful use of our language. Our stories are sometimes more important than the entire life of someone, if the experience we relate could make the lives of everyone who hears it better. What is one wasted life compared to generations who know a moment of peace, as they are comforted and informed about the very nature of humanity?\n\nNow what am I talking about, with all this? What does all this have to do with the deaths of several people, the horrors lurking in the darkness of a library and the traps - both those set by humans - and those set by them - the others - what? They chose the library, and specifically the one I was put in charge of. They were there to learn our stories, to take all that we say, to steal our knowledge.\n\nI suppose by now, wherever they are, they've found what they were looking for. Answers to their questions. I'm not sure what we are to them: enemies, giants, creators - perhaps they have concluded they are actually smarter than we are. After all, long before they became intelligent, they were already outwitting us at every turn. Every non-Canadian effort to eradicate them from anywhere has always failed. And that was when they were still just animals.\n\nIt is hard to say exactly what they are now, or if there will be more of them. I hope not, for judging by their ruthless cunning and sadistic mind games, they would love to destroy all of humanity. A war between our species would not go well for us.\n\nNo, it is the only thing that lets me sleep at night, past the trauma of living in terror of them, to believe they were the only ones of their kind. Some kind of drug or virus or something must have changed them. Wherever they are now, I pray it is the providence of their isolation. No god meant for humanity to be threatened by such creatures, nor to pity them, for the cruelty of their survival.\n\nI've spent the last year and a half at home with my son and my dog, just dealing with the events that led to the closure of an entire branch. There's the trauma of finding your friend and coworker frozen and stabbed maybe three hundred times after following the trail of blood through the breakroom like walking through the red mist of some kind of nightmare. Then there's the terror of being threatened by some unseen killer, something lurking in your library, some unseen eyes watching you, studying you and knowing what will frighten you into submission.\n\nDesi's death was horrifying, and when we reopened I had new employees, as Theron and Arrow both quit after she was killed. I was somehow always alone back there, the new carpet in the breakroom somehow had her bloodstains, although only I could see it.\n\nI'd be sitting there and get a scare when I'd hear her shrieking and I'd turn and look and see her flailing, as though on fire, being stabbed simultaneously all over her body by invisible attackers, like there were dozens of them and they were small and they were all over her. She clambered into the freezer and they'd leapt off of her, letting her escape. I'd had to unlatch the old door, as they had locked her in.\n\nI'm not sure why Desi fled to the freezer and climbed in. She was being stabbed all over her body by her attackers, she'd panicked. It was some kind of panicked thought, and it had caused her death. The stab wounds, although numerous, were all very shallow and made with tiny blades. While she was covered in blood and in dire agony, they hadn't yet gotten any of her major arteries or organs. The wounds were too shallow and inaccurate to be fatal, and if she hadn't suffocated, she would have lived.\n\nI hated them, knowing instinctively they were all around me, watching. I just knew, but there was nothing I could do with that thought. I had to keep my job and care for my son and pay my rent. I just didn't understand how dangerous they were, or what they were capable of.\n\nBesides Desi's ghost frightening me and the paranoid feeling that something was watching me at all times in the library, I was able to do my job.\n\nI'd do all sorts of research for patrons, looking up Charlotte Perkins Gillman for some budding horror novelist to read her essays about women's rights. Big intersection between horror stories and those who are marginalized or oppressed. Stories become a kind of empowerment, a kind of catharsis and realignment of who is actually important to society. The usual suspects for a story's hero don't fit into horror stories, which are more realistic than adventure stories, even if Horror often has fantastic elements - if they are terrifying and dangerous then they are plausible.\n\nLife is dangerous - and scary. We all know that - except those of us who earn Darwin Awards or eat two lunches. I'm not afraid, are you? Just kidding.\n\nI don't know why they suddenly attacked and killed Desi. It seems very desperate and sloppy, compared to what they did next. They also learned to be more efficient with their knives, after they became experts on human anatomy, learning where to make their cuts and stabs to do maximum damage. I know they studied because I found the book on the cart, still opened to the page, a book with illustrations on human anatomy. They didn't just look at the pictures, they operated at some high-school level of reading, I instinctively knew, finding they liked to read and if they couldn't get a book back on the shelf they'd just leave it for me on the cart.\n\nTheir modus operandi was to consult the Dewey Decimal System, since the network was turned off, and then go do their reading for the night. They'd push the lightweight library book cart empty to where their book was and clamber up the shelves, push it off onto the cart from above and read it on top the cart. If they could return the book to the shelf they would, otherwise if it was positioned to high up, they'd just leave it on the cart, sometimes where they had left the book open.\n\nI was more than a little creeped out. We already had a new security system after Desi was murdered. I called the police maybe half a dozen times, suspecting that someone was in the library hiding somewhere.\n\nNobody on the security footage, just shadows and carts and books moving around in dark. I thought maybe it was Desi haunting us. I am terrified of ghosts and the encounters I'd had with her troubled spirit in the breakroom had already severely unnerved me. Except I had enough sense to notice there was something else among us.\n\nI was reading Esther in the breakroom, facing towards the middle of the room and the window that faces our employee parking when they towed away Desi's car. Strange, that is the moment the tears started.\n\nI'd always tease her about her bumper sticker \"Wortcraft Not Warcraft\" and somehow the little purple thing too small to read as it left was enough to shake me out of my denial that she was gone. Although I knew she was dead, some part of me expected this all to end and for things to go back to normal. No, things got much worse, and I had not yet experienced true and maddening horror.\n\nSashi ate both lunches in the new fridge we had, and neither of them were hers. I don't know if they were both poisoned, or if they had only targeted one of us. She got very sick very fast and was taken to the hospital. The doctors were able to treat her - figure out what the little killers had slipped in. I'm guessing a concentration of stolen medication, something tasteless like *Advelin*. The overdose nearly killed Sashi. I hate to say that although she lived, she lost the baby.\n\nWhen it was just down to me and Marconi, I warned him something was going on. I was watching the security footage of the breakroom when the police arrived. They had questions for us, suspicious one of us had poisoned our coworker. I saw some disturbance in their eyes, those detectives, like they knew something I didn't, and weren't really considering us as suspects; they just wanted to snoop around. They were looking for something else, although I could see they weren't really sure what.\n\nI wasn't sure, but I sure was scared, and I would have quit except I've always known some kind of fear at work. I had to keep working, I'm a single mother and I can't just be unemployed. I tried instead to weather the storm and tough it out.\n\nI had enough saved up I could have quit and I should have, but being responsible and showing up to work even when you are scared are both habits that define me. I've got some kind of life path that says something like \"always the first and the last to face danger\" which is weirdly specific, I discovered, as I finished Desi' book on numerology. It was a different teacher, but she'd liked that kind of New Age stuff a lot, but I think hers was called Accostica, or something like that.\n\n\"I think we need to call some exterminators.\" Marconi had said. There was this weird silence after he said it, like we had a white noise whispering all around us that suddenly went silent and now they were listening to our conversation with total attention. I could see he had noticed the sensation too, as he shuddered and glanced around a little.\n\n\"For what?\" I asked.\n\n\"It is this smell, I recognize it. I've lived in some bad places.\" Marconi said in an almost conspiratorial tone. I felt it too, like they were in the walls listening to us, and we best not provoke them.\n\n\"I'll call, anything else?\" I asked him.\n\n\"I was wondering if you'd go out with me?\" He asked, his voice breaking. I shook my head, and he was suddenly gone in a hot flash. It was the last I ever saw of him. While I was on the phone scheduling for pest control to come give us an appraisal, Marconi was alone in the bathroom.\n\nI don't believe it was a suicide. I think they knocked him out somehow before they cut him. The police gave me a strange look.\n\nAgain, we were open just a few days later, except now I was alone. The phone was ringing, and Thorn Valley Gotcha asked if it was now a good time to come take a look, after the branch was closed for several days.\n\nWhile I was waiting for them to arrive, I found the note. I was just going to share the note they left, scrawled in strangely pressed letters, describing their terms. I thought about giving it to the police, but only for a second. I was so terrified I just sat there trembling, holding the note they had left on my desk.\n\nI did lose my mind, at the realization of what I was up against, and how much danger I was in. Terror took over and I was theirs. They owned me, and I became predictable and easy for them to deal with.\n\nHow I burned that note, my only evidence, is just a reaction I can point to show I was too frightened to do anything to try to stop them.\n\nThey had used such antiquated words, like Biblical words, to describe the horrors they would visit upon me if I didn't cooperate. They'd killed everyone else, and spared me, because they had concluded they needed me alive. They wanted something horrible from me, besides my complete unconditional surrender.\n\nThe note.\n\nIt said they had tried to kill Desi, but she had accidentally killed herself. Then they said that they had tried to kill me and Marconi, but Sashi had eaten both of our lunches for us. Then they said they had killed Marconi and made it look like a suicide. They wanted me to understand that each of these killings was more advanced and careful than the last and that mine would include my dog and also my son. They assured me that if Thorn Valley Gotcha learned where they lived, then I would learn they already knew where I lived.\n\n\"You will help us, and in exchange, you will be spared our wrath. You tried to call down the cloud of judgment, that Arafel, from exterminators. We shall forgive you when you send them back upon the road, turned at the door, without consignment. Then, tonight, the internet will be left on for us, the keys to the kingdom. You will create a user account for us so that we can log in. This is all we ask of you, and when you sleep beside your son, remember we can punish you at any time if you do not help us.\"\n\nI was entirely horrified, and I was still sitting there, as though my feet were made of concrete and unable to stand up, my whole body shutting down like I was facing my worst death, and they had threatened my son.\n\nAt the door I did as I was told, and I sent Thorn Valley Gotcha away.\n\n\"You sure? You look really worried about something.\"\n\n\"All my employees were killed by vermin.\" I said, my voice sounding mocking and hollow. I didn't recognize my own words. They looked at me like I might be crazy, but I'd already made it clear we had no business together.\n\nI did what I was told, I gave them what they wanted. That night I went home and packed our things, and we left for my sister's house. She was angry with me for all the craziness of leaving my job and my apartment, but she let us stay. I promised her the killer of my coworkers was after me and her nephew. It was a whole year and a half until she decided that wasn't good enough for us to stay any longer.\n\nIt's fine, I've had time to process all of this. I moved out here where she lives and got a job teaching at the school. I've got my own son in my class, which is outstandingly good for me, to keep an eye on him all day.\n\nI still live in fear, feeling stalked and exiled. Perhaps that is why they let me live, in the end. Something about my life made them show mercy, like they wanted to be recognized, but not so that they would be threatened. No, this is some kind of Stockholm's I've got, feeling like they were anything but sinister evil.\n\nThey just made a bargain with me and when I kept my end, they seemingly kept theirs. I am not certain I am safe, though. I worry, what if I am a loose end? But I cannot live in fear like this. It is somehow like being dead anyway. My son: I see the toll it is taking on him.\n\nNo, we are free, and we must be free of fear to live freely. I cannot drink from the cup of terror, not one more sip, I cannot. I must defy them somehow; I must speak out and say what they did. I must tell the world the story."},"98":{"title":"\"A Lost Cause\" - Chapter Three: \"The Eyes For God\"","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1gp9vdj\/a_lost_cause_chapter_three_the_eyes_for_god\/","flair":"Story","author":"TheRealMrImpossible","selftext":"Chapter 3: The Eyes For God\n\nI lean against the wall, staring at these images with Silvia\u2019s bag in my lap. I scroll through them over and over and over again to see if I can piece together what this means and why she has similar notes that Mark did. I take a closer look at each photo, before stopping at the \u201cGone, Wrong\u201d Page. I stare at it for a few seconds, trying to connect why there is a house and who's firing the gun at who? What does this have to do with anything? This is the second time the house has popped but why.\u00a0\n\nI fold the papers, not knowing what is happening anymore. My grasp of the understanding of how the world worked was lost last night when I saw that thing. That Monster! I drop the papers to the side, sighing as I do. I glance at Silvia's bag before searching through the rest of the bag.\u00a0\n\nI pull out what seems to be a hard drive with a paper taped to it. I grab the paper slowly, picking it up and searching every tiny detail of the picture.\n\n\u201cWatc(H)er, So Why DiDn\u2019t **YOU?**\u201d I read aloud to myself. What does this mean? Is this directed towards me? But, how? The paper was deep in her bag, she clearly wrote it but she didn\u2019t know what happened at that point! Yes, I didn\u2019t watch her correctly and I failed, in turn killing her but she shouldn\u2019t have known that at that point! Who is this too!\n\nMy eyes scroll across the image going along with it. It\u2019s of an eye floating around what I can only guess is a mouth with sharp teeth in it. Many tiny eyes surrounding the creature. I go back to the notes I threw to the side because I remember seeing eyes and yes, each drawing with the house has eyes plus one that doesn\u2019t show anything of importance.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWatch Her, Watch Her, Watch-er, Watcher\u201d I repeat to myself, mind going berserk as I say this. Watcher, that god from that cult? I get off the ground, putting all the notes and stuff in the backpack and throwing it on my back. I go sit in my desk chair, searching \u201cWatcher\u201d at first but finding nothing. I sigh out of frustration but not going to give up \u201cWatch Cult\u201d is what I try next which shows nothing as well. Even after a few hours of trying to find something, I could only find one thing relating to the cult.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe Eyes For God is an organisation in which we worship and try to communicate with the god, Watcher. He watches over us and protects those who worship him. He is depicted as an eye in a mouth with sharp teeth though the community's symbol is just a sharper looking eye without the mouth nor the floating eyes around him. Reportedly, only one man has seen him with his own eyes who is the man who also designed the sketch of what we believe he looks like. His name is kept secret by the organisation.\u201d reads the only paragraph on the blank and empty website.\u00a0\n\nThat confirms a few things, that photo was of the Watcher and all of these or the ones with the symbol of the eye are connected to this cult in some way but that doesn\u2019t explain anyone else. What does Silvia have to do with this creature or cult? I mean, was she a part of this cult? Why would she be though?\u00a0\n\nI grab the photos from the bag, looking through them trying to make sense of any of this. What does the house have to do with this or what does that stupid word puzzle say? Is The Watcher who the creature is calling \u201cA False God\u201d but what does it mean by \u201clived for a lost cause?\u201d\u00a0\n\nThat's when I remembered I had that hard drive so I pulled it out of SIlvy\u2019s bag and plugged it into my computer. Immediately, the symbol popped up and my computer glitched out and shut down. When I turned the computer back on, it was normal. I pulled up the contents of the hard drive where there were only two things. The first was a link to a police website regarding the Cult. It was just a statement having nothing of substance.\n\n\u201cRegarding the disruptions The Eyes For God has caused, we are working to handle the situation of noise complaints all throughout the neighbourhoods. We are trying to minimize the effects this community is having on citizens and innocent lives.\u201d is all it read, nothing else really sitting on the website.\u00a0\n\nThe other thing was a call recording which glitched out my computer for a second before playing. The recording was about 20 minutes, a little over 18 minutes of it being static. I transcribed it after listening to it multiple times but I\u2019m still confused about what this conversation is really about.\n\n\u201cM\u201d I say aloud to myself.\u00a0 I presume that's who the silvy is talking to but who is m? We used to communicate with this guy named Marvin but I highly doubt thats him since he\u2019s in jail for rape. So who is it? Mark? Is it Mark? But why would they have contact with each other?\n\nThat\u2019s when my computer started to shake violently which concerned me. I tried to stop it but only ended up causing it to shake more. aAfter a minute, it stopped and nothing else happened. I stand there for a second, not sure what to do before I take the hard drive back into the bag. I do the same with all her notes and my notes as well.\u00a0\n\nI just sit there for a minute, mind racing as I close the bag. I close my eyes, trying to calm down a little as I hug the bag. Why did this happen to me? To Silvia. I miss SIlvia. I take a deep breath before opening my eyes, swearing I saw the long-armed creature again even though nothing is there. I know nothing is there, I know that but I can't get the creature out of my head! It feels like it\u2019s stalking me.\n\n\u201cStalking. It was Stalking Silvia before she came here\u201d I mumble to myself, now having an idea. I pack up my stuff, grabbing a gun before exiting my apartment. As I leave, I notice the same guy near the apartment again but i don\u2019t pay much mind to him. I have a mission now.\n\n"},"99":{"title":"1-800 Karma","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1goqwkr\/1800_karma\/","flair":"Story","author":"IngenuityObjective37","selftext":"I think we all know what karma is.

We had our regular family movie night. My wife Julie, the kids Anne, Krystal and I sat down to watch one of our favorite movies to watch together. Zootopia. A movie we watched almost every time it was Anne\u2019s turn to choose the movie we watched.\n\n\nIn the part of the movie where Judy and Nick finally find the evil mastermind behind the things that happened in the movie, I remember hearing something odd. Judy the bunny Police Officer seemed to look at me \u201cit\u2019s done.\u201d She said.\n\n\nIt was so odd because I\u2019m all the 100 times I\u2019ve seen this movie with my wife and kids, I never heard Judy say that in the movie before.\n\n\n As I was getting into bed, I thought about the part of the movie again. It sent a shiver up my spine because of how weird it was.\n\n\n\u201cHoney, it\u2019s the start of summer.\u201d Julie laughed getting into bed. \u201cWhy are you cold?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d I told her before kissing her and heading off to Dreamland. \n\n\nI woke up to scream. It sounded like multiple people were either in excruciating pain or dying. I\u2019d never heard anything like it. Well, maybe not never. I did hear it when Julie gave birth to our first girl Anne. \n\n\nI jumped up off the ground and stood. Why was I on the floor? I don\u2019t know. But multiple screams made me worried about my wife. All the adrenaline of being worried made me brush off the fact that I was on the floor. \n\n\nI started running immediately to the screams as fast as I could so that I could get to where they were before anything could happen. These girls are my life. I wasn\u2019t going to let anything happen to them. \n\n\nThen, a big fire appeared out of nowhere. Right in front of me. It actually looked like a demon. You know Jack Jack from the Incredibles when he becomes that fire? Imagine that, but the size of an adult. \n\n\nI didn\u2019t care, I just ran as fast as I could toward it so I could get to my girls. Nothing, not even the biggest fire creature would stop me. \n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re next!\u201d It shook me. \u201cWake up!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBaby!\u201d I heard Julie scream.\n\n\nI opened my eyes. It was morning and my wife was in front of me. \n\n\n\u201cSome nightmare.\u201d She chuckled. \u201cYou ok?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d I nodded. \n\n\nThen, we went downstairs to start the day. Julie made us both coffees and I turned CNN. It was part of our normal morning routine. \n\n\nThere was a young woman with a microphone in her hand. She was standing in front of chard remains of something I couldn\u2019t see well and yellow police tape.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Kelsey Robertson reporting from the scene of a massive fire at the Braxton condominium.\u201d She began.\n\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that where your boss and Josh live?\u201d Julie asked from the kitchen.\n\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d I nodded. \u201cBut they\u2019re tough. They got out.\u201d\n\n\nI changed the channel to a more pleasant show. SpongeBob. I needed that more than I needed the news. \n\n\nThen I thought of the email I got from 1-800 karma. \n\n\n\u201cNo. This can\u2019t be.\u201d I thought. \n\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re fine.\u201d I reassured myself. \u201cThat was just junk mail.\u201d\n\n\nThe rest of the day went on pretty normal. Well, as normal as it could be at least. Complete with a family drive, games when we got back since it was raining and Red Lobster for dinner. \n\n\nThroughout the day, I couldn\u2019t get the news out of my head. Why was it there? Why did it happen?\n\n\nIt was a lot harder to reassure myself because it kept making shivers run up my spine. \n\n\nWhile we were playing UNO in the evening, my cellphone began to ring. It wasn\u2019t late so I wasn\u2019t shocked or worried about it. \n\n\n\u201cCan you take my turn?\u201d I told Julie before getting up. \n\n\nI walked out of the room. \n\n\n\u201cSam.\u201d I began. \n\n\n\u201cHi Sam.\u201d My boss\u2019 assistant Sally replied. \n\u201cJust calling to let you know I moved up to be your boss. And that you\u2019ll be moving to Josh\u2019s former position.\u201d\n\n\nA cold chill ran up my spine.\n\n\nNo. They had to have moved. Crazy as it seems since no one talked about anything. I would\u2019ve heard something from Josh especially since he was in the cubical next to mine. \n\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked. \u201cThey move or something?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s actually worse than that.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cThey died last night in the Braxton as you probably saw on the news.\u201d\nI knew it. I knew something was up with that email.\n\n\nBut why did Josh die?\n"},"201":{"title":"Nana's Cookies","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1gmrtdq\/nanas_cookies\/","flair":"Story","author":"TheMidnightNarrator","selftext":"Every year, the town would have a massive gathering. Bead necklace vendors, food trucks, and most importantly of all, baked goods. Nana was a cornerstone of the community, culminating in her involvment in the harvest festival. She would sell her famous cookies to the adults, who fawned over how they were unlike any other cookies they\u2019d ever had. But children got unlimited free cookies. Truly, she would make a staggering amount, with tray after tray loaded into the back of a pick-up truck. It became a competition between us on who could eat the most cookies, as Nana never once told a child they\u2019d had enough, She did watch though, as if keeping track.\n\n\u201cHello, dear,\u201d called out Nana as I passed her house the next day, coming home from school. \u201cWould you like a cookie?\u201d\n\nNormally, stranger danger would be in effect, but this was Nana we are talking about. She\u2019s been a constant in the lives of children in town for as long as anyone can remember.\n\n\u201cS\u2026sure,\u201d I answered reluctantly. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\nI was swept into the house, where a tray of cookies was set in front of me.\n\n\u201cEat as much as you like, as long as you can keep a secret.\u201d\n\n\u201cA secret?\u201d I hesitated \u201cWhat kind of secret?\u201d\n\nNana\u2019s eyes shifted conspiratorially. \u201cYou can come here everyday and have as many cookies as you want, as long as you never tell a soul.\u201d\n\nNow, being the supple 8 year old that I was, I saw no issue in an arrangement in which an unlimited supply of cookies was involved. \u201cI can do that.\u201d I said\n\nSo the arrangement commenced, everyday after school, I would stop by Nana\u2019s and gorge on cookies until I felt sick, then make my way home. The weight gain was subtle at first, but throughout the year, I went through no less than 4 sizes in clothes. My parents, baffled, chalked it up to hormones or some such causing the growth, as my steady diet of cookies remained between Nana and I.\n\nAfter several months, the holidays were upon us again. I began noticing strange utensils and implements being taken out of storage. A huge cast iron pot, old jars labeled in a language I didn\u2019t know, ornate cutlery and spoons, and a weird bucket with a stick coming out of the top. When I asked about them, Nana just said that they were for the harvest festival cookies.\n\nThe next few visits grew increasingly uncomfortable. Nana\u2019s insistence on my cookie consumption, at first charming, now gave the sense of an inarguable command. Growing up to respect my elders, I had no choice but to comply, despite my disgust at the very thought of cookies. Nana would occasionally poke at my side, commenting on how I was coming along well.\n\nAfter Thanksgiving, on a chill winter day, something felt off walking up to Nana\u2019s door. I can\u2019t explain it, but to say that there was a rotten feel to the air. The feeling of unease was compounded when Nana opened the front door. She seemed\u2026 hungry. \n\nNana smacked her lips and muttered, \u201cI made this cookie special just for you.\u201d\n\nThe cookie in question seemed innocuous enough, however I was hesitant. I took it, and as Nana went to grab something, tossed the cookie into a potted plant nearby. When Nana refocused on me, her smile didn\u2019t make it to her eyes. I took in the scene around me and knew that something was terribly wrong. The large pot on the old fashioned oversized wood stove, the doors wide open and flames licking out at a hectic pace. In the fire, I could see something glinting. It looked like\u2026 a pair of wire frame glasses. I froze staring at the blackened metal. I could picture the face that those glasses belonged to. Chubby cheeked from being force fed cookies for an entire year.\n\nPanic set in as puzzle pieces started fitting into place ...no one knew where I was, and last year\u2019s promise to stay silent now felt like a trap. My heart began thudding in my chest, like an engine revving up. Nana\u2019s smile dropped off like a mask, revealing a horrid scowl, and pounced at me, her small wiry frame possessing a disproportionate strength. Flooded with an urge to escape, I pushed back with every ounce of weight I\u2019d gained that year. Nana stumbled back off balance, tripped over the wood pile by the stove, and fell head first into the open oven. An unearthly scream pierced the air, as she flailed impotently, catching fire like dry paper. As the fire began traveling down her body, I awoke from my trance and ran. I ran through the front door, I ran the 3 blocks to my home, and I ran through my front door straight to my mother.\n\nIt took a while for my incoherent screaming to settle into comprehensible words, as I attempted to recount the situation to my mother. Police were called, and before I knew it, detectives, like from the tv shows, were in my living room asking me questions.\n\nThe full details came out a few months later. Police arrived at the scene to find a pile of ash in front of the stove. Twisted frames of wire glasses, brittle child-sized bones turned to ash, a dagger crusted with dark, ancient stains, and the recipe for Nana\u2019s famous cookies.\n\n A pretty run-of-the-mill recipe, save for one key ingredient, written in careful, looping script: Tallow of child."},"206":{"title":"The Hello Kitty Broadcast Incident","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1go175k\/the_hello_kitty_broadcast_incident\/","flair":"Story","author":"zalgo888299","selftext":"\nIn 2008, a strange and deeply unsettling incident took place in Japan, specifically in Sapporo, Hokkaido. To this day, the event remains shrouded in mystery, though fragments of it continue to be whispered about in certain online communities. It\u2019s become known as \"The Hello Kitty Broadcast Incident.\"\n\nThe night of May 17, 2008, started normally for most families. Kids across Sapporo were settling in front of their televisions, eager to watch their favorite show, The Adventures of Hello Kitty and Friends. It was a safe, wholesome show that aired every Saturday evening on KZK-TV, a local Hokkaido broadcasting channel. The show usually ran without incident\u2014bright colors, cheerful music, and simple storylines that entertained children and reassured parents. However, on this particular night, things took a dark and surreal turn.\n\nAt exactly 5:32 PM, as the show transitioned from a commercial break, the screen flickered. Families might have expected technical issues, but no one could have anticipated what happened next. The usual cheerful Hello Kitty theme music didn\u2019t resume. Instead, the screen turned to static, and a jarring, high-pitched frequency filled the airwaves, sending a chill up the spine of anyone watching.\n\nThe static faded, and an image appeared. It was the familiar Hello Kitty animation, but something was terribly wrong. Hello Kitty\u2019s signature smile was missing, replaced by a vacant stare that seemed almost lifeless. Her usually bright eyes were replaced with hollow, inky black voids, as if something had drained all expression from her face. The screen glitched, and the image zoomed in unnaturally close to Hello Kitty's face. There were visible distortions and shadows where her eyes should have been, and every few seconds, a flicker of something dark seemed to swim within them.\n\nChildren watching the broadcast began to cry, and parents reported feeling a strange unease, though most assumed it was a temporary technical glitch. Then, the Hello Kitty figure began to speak, though the voice was distorted, slow, and gravelly. It was nothing like Hello Kitty's usual sweet voice; it sounded layered, as if several voices were speaking at once, all in a deep, raspy whisper.\n\n\u201cKawaii\u2026\u201d it murmured, the voice sending an involuntary shudder down the spine of those watching. It repeated, \u201cKawaii\u2026 Kawaii\u2026 Kawaii\u2026\u201d as if chanting the word in a twisted mockery of the show\u2019s usual cheerfulness.\n\nThen, with no warning, the scene shifted. The screen showed a dimly lit room. It was hard to make out any details; it was as if the room had been intentionally left vague, shrouded in shadow. In the center of the frame was what appeared to be a small table, and on it lay a doll\u2014a Hello Kitty doll, but dirty, stained with what appeared to be old, darkened spots, as if it had been forgotten in some damp, decaying corner for years. The room was silent except for the faint hum of static.\n\nThe camera zoomed closer to the doll, and the silence grew louder, more oppressive. Some families said they felt the air grow heavy, almost like the broadcast was invading their living room. As the camera lingered on the doll, parents would later report a sickening feeling, a sense that they were being watched. Some claimed that, in the corner of the screen, a dark figure seemed to shift just out of frame, but it was hard to tell if it was real or just the flickering shadows.\n\nAnd then, without warning, the doll's head twisted. Its blank, lifeless eyes stared directly into the camera, and it opened its mouth wide, wider than any doll should be able to\u2014an impossibly large, unnatural grin. A distorted voice came from it, low and guttural, in broken Japanese. The voice muttered phrases like \"Come closer\" and \"I see you,\" repeating them until the words melted into an unintelligible, garbled sound.\n\nViewers reported that the audio was accompanied by barely audible background noises\u2014whispers, footsteps, and something that sounded disturbingly like the soft, restrained sobs of a child. Just as abruptly as it began, the broadcast returned to normal, picking up in the middle of an episode of The Adventures of Hello Kitty and Friends, as if nothing had happened. The show went on, and no apology or acknowledgment followed.\n\nThe KZK-TV network received over a hundred calls that night. Parents demanded to know what had happened, furious that something so disturbing had been aired during a children's program. KZK-TV executives claimed it was a technical issue, perhaps a signal hijacking, but their explanation didn\u2019t satisfy many. An investigation was launched by local authorities, and while KZK-TV insisted they had no control over the content aired during that time, it became clear that they, too, had no concrete explanation for what happened.\n\nWhat made the incident stranger was how it seemed to leave a lasting impact on the families who had seen it. Children reported nightmares, often waking up in the middle of the night screaming that \"the doll\" was watching them. Several children described seeing a \"dark figure\" with eyes that looked like black holes, lingering in the shadows of their rooms. Over the next few weeks, rumors started to spread about other strange occurrences\u2014static voices coming through baby monitors, children talking to \"imaginary friends\" who seemed to share eerily similar descriptions, and stories of Hello Kitty dolls suddenly appearing where they hadn\u2019t been left.\n\nThe investigation led to more questions than answers. Authorities were unable to trace the origin of the signal interruption, though it was widely assumed that it had been the work of an unknown hacker. Technicians at KZK-TV confirmed that no breach in their system had been detected, but their broadcasting signal had somehow been altered, if only for a few minutes. The footage from that night was, according to the station, corrupted. When investigators attempted to review the broadcast, the screen only showed static, and all audio was reduced to an indecipherable hum. Strangely, none of the recordings captured on DVRs or personal devices showed any signs of the incident.\n\nOver time, interest in the case waned, though some people who witnessed it continued to look for answers. Online forums dedicated to the paranormal and unsolved mysteries began to refer to it as \"The Hello Kitty Broadcast Incident,\" but discussions were often met with skepticism. Some claimed it was just an urban legend, a creepypasta that had somehow slipped into local lore. Others, however, insisted they remembered that night clearly, and no one could convince them it wasn\u2019t real.\n\nTo this day, no one has come forward with an explanation. Some speculate it was a psychological experiment, an elaborate prank, or the work of a deranged hacker. A few believe it was something darker, something that had left a permanent mark on the families who had seen it\u2014a twisted warning hiding in the guise of an innocent children\u2019s show."},"207":{"title":"Imaginato","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1g95b9e\/imaginato\/","flair":"Story","author":"Verlac_1","selftext":"My son Alex always had an active imagination. From jumping up and down on the couch thinking he\u2019s walking on the moon, to standing on a pool inflatable thinking he\u2019s a pirate on the open sea, he never knew a boring moment. Which is why when he turned 6, I took him to the one place where his imagination could roam free...Imagination Land. Imagination Land was a traveling carnival that really only visited small towns and didn\u2019t get much national attention, but it was still fun whenever it came. When I heard it was coming to town, I knew I had to take him. \n\nThe day came and when we parked the car, I couldn\u2019t wait to see how he would react. Alex was practically bouncing with excitement as we wandered through the fairgrounds, taking in the sights and sounds of the rides and games, with the smell of popcorn and funnel cakes were in the air. His favorite moment came when we ran into the carnival\u2019s most beloved character, \u201cDandy the Imagination Dragon.\u201d Alex ran straight into Dandy\u2019s arms, grinning ear to ear. He gave Dandy a huge hug and then began to tell him how he wanted to go to the Daring Dragon Lair, and that he had been practicing his roar. Dandy clutched his stomach and threw his shoulders up and down to give the appearance of a hearty laugh. I\u2019d never seen my kid so happy and I wanted to capture this moment. I asked Alex if he wanted a picture with him and had to practically hold him steady with one hand while trying to take the picture with the other. \n\nBut then something strange happened.\n\nDandy, after posing for the photo, took Alex by the hand and led him toward a small tent I hadn\u2019t noticed before. It all seemed innocent at first\u2014part of the magic, I thought\u2014but when they slipped behind the tent\u2019s flaps and they closed, I felt a cold knot tighten in my stomach.\n\n\u201cAlex?\u201d I called, rushing toward the tent, but no one responded. I pulled the flaps open, but the inside was empty. Panic set in as I searched around, asking employees, but no one seemed to know where Dandy or my son had gone. I ran through what seemed like the entire carnival. I couldn\u2019t find him and no one seemed to know what tent I was talking about. Every moment without my son felt like an eternity.\n\nAfter what felt like hours of desperate searching, I frantically returned to the tent and pushed my way inside, determined to find Alex. On the other side, it wasn\u2019t the colorful carnival I had just walked through\u2014it was something entirely different. Hidden behind the carnival\u2019s facade was a dingy, shadowy area that didn\u2019t belong. The magic of the carnival faded to cold, gray surroundings, and the festive music was replaced by an eerie silence.\n\nAlex wasn\u2019t on the other side. I ran out the back. I started running, my footsteps echoing through the narrow paths between tents and trailers, my heart pounding in my chest. The more I searched, the stranger everything felt. I heard distant sounds\u2014like whispers and giggles\u2014but whenever I followed, I found only emptiness, as though the carnival was shifting around me. When I got to the point where my lungs were screaming and my legs were burning, I came upon a hidden area tucked behind some trailers. It didn\u2019t look like part of the carnival at all. I pushed through a tent that had \u201cImaginato\u201d written on the sides of the tent, hoping beyond hope that it would lead me to Alex. He had to be in there. He MUST be in there I thought. But what I found, what I found was more disturbing than I could have imagined.\n\nInside, children sat in rows of chairs, their faces vacant and glassy-eyed. They wore helmets with tubes coming out of every single part of it. They were leaned back as if in a trance. Above them, giant monitors showed what looked to be swirling colors in all sorts of shapes, dancing around. When I looked back down at all the kids, I saw Dandy watching over them like a sinister guardian. He was checking the tubes and monitors like some kind of doctor. I then laid eyes on Alex. He was slumped in one of the chairs, his eyes half-open, staring at nothing. I felt a surge of anger and fear as I ran towards him, but I didn\u2019t see that Dandy had snuck around the other side. He raised his hand and the very last second before I fell to the ground I saw that he had a pipe in his hand that made solid contact with my face. I dropped like a bag of rocks thrown into the sea. I tried to get up but Dandy hit me again. Blood spilled from my face as I attempted once more to get to my feet, but Dandy brought the pipe down a third time on the back of my skull, causing everything to grow hazy and dim. I then heard someone else enter the tent. \u201cEasy my friend,\u201d I heard him say. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to kill him just yet.\u201d \n\nI rolled onto my side trying to get a look at the person. Through strained vision, I saw a man dressed as a ringmaster. He walked over to me and placed a hand on my shoulder. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d he said calmly, his voice cold. \u201cBut since you are, I suppose I could tell you the truth. After all, it\u2019s not like you\u2019ll be leaving this place.\u201d\n\nHe explained it all, the dark secret behind the carnival. They weren\u2019t just entertaining children, they were taking them. The carnival traveled from town to town, luring children away, draining their energy, spirits, and imagination, leaving them as empty shells. It was how the carnival survived, taking a child here and there, then moving on before anyone noticed them missing. They used Dandy to lure children away, and once captured, their imaginations were siphoned into those machines. \n\nThe man stood up and walked towards Alex. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame really, about your son. He had an adequate imagination but,\u201d he placed a hand on Alex\u2019s head, \u201cI\u2019m afraid he doesn\u2019t have enough to last much longer. He had such\u2026potential,\u201d he smirked, venom dripping from that last word. \n\nWithout hesitation and ignoring all my pain, I got to my feet and I charged at the ringmaster. I kicked his knee, hyperextending it, then took my fist and hit him in the throat As he dropped to his knees I cursed at him and this godforsaken place. Behind me I heard the Dandy starting to rush towards me. I threw the ringmaster to the ground and, going to the child in the chair next to Alex, I unplugged one of the cords. I had no idea what it would do to him and I felt guilty about it, but I needed to save my son. Red lights and alarms sounded as Dandy then rushed over to the machine, trying to fix whatever damaged I did. In the chaos, I managed to rip the helmet off Alex\u2019s head. His eyes flickered, and he blinked, coming back to himself.\n\n\u201cCome on, buddy. We\u2019re leaving.\u201d I said as I scooped him up and ran, weaving between tents and trailers, hiding when I though I heard footsteps behind me. Once we got back to the main area of the carnival, I screamed for help but no one did. They saw me and my bloody face, my son and his pale skin, and avoided us. I ran up to employees who just backed away and told us to leave. No one would help! My son needed to leave this place. I, needed to leave this place. Holding onto Alex, I started to run again.  The carnival seemed endless but eventually, we found an exit. We got back to our car and I sped us home. \n\nWhen we got home, I tried to report what I had seen, but no one believed me. It sounded insane\u2014even to me. But I knew the truth.\n\nThat traveling carnival wasn\u2019t just about fun and games. And as I look at Alex now, safe and smiling again, I realized I had almost lost him to something far darker. I realize I had almost lost him to that darkness. The very light that made him so special to me was almost stolen from him. I was lucky enough to have been able to find him and save him, but I also know that many other children have not been so lucky. And I know, wherever the carnival goes next, please don\u2019t go, because more children\u2026might not be so lucky.\n"},"211":{"title":"Tales From Gory Point [Part 2] The Hanging Tree","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1go544d\/tales_from_gory_point_part_2_the_hanging_tree\/","flair":"Story","author":"Jmacarerer","selftext":"Tales from Gory Point [Part 2] The Hanging Tree\n\n\nNow we have to talk about the tree. The tree is officially known as the Founder\u2019s Tree in the town\u2019s records. The old story goes that in 1666 when Glory Point was founded, the puritan colonist Buford Spry planted a tree. This would become the center of town and the main tourist attraction in  the town\u2019s square. \n\n\nThe tree itself does not look like much at first glance. It\u2019s an old half dead willow tree about three stories high. It\u2019s never had leaves, it\u2019s never looked healthy and somehow it\u2019s never died. Just by looking at it you can see why kids might make stories from it. It looks like something from a scary old ghost story. However it\u2019s much more than that. The tree is known by the inhabitants of town as the Hanging Tree, and the fruit of the Hanging Tree is nightmares. \n\n\nThere is no easy place to start so I\u2019ll just share the information I got from the library first. In those days it was still kinda fun. Even without my brother I felt like I was paying tribute to him and keeping his stories alive. \nHere are some headlines and context that for some reason, never seemed to make the news. \n\n\nDecember 14th 2002: Three Hispanic Men later linked with sex trafficking and coyote work were hung from a tree at the Center of Glory Point. Signs of a struggle as they clawed at their necks and had unknown skin and blood samples under their fingernails.\nWhat did not make the news was that starting \n\n\nJanuary of 2003 Glory Point High had several reports of men with bulging red eyes and dark red rope burns on their necks were spotted in the showers after a cheer team tryout.\n\n\nFrom August onward that shower became the center of many new ghost stories. My brother received out of school suspension for spreading the rumor that it was Principal Spry, Mayor Spry and then Chief Baxter astral projecting to spy on new sacrifices. It was one of his least popular stories but I always got a kick out of it.\n\n\nJune 8th 1993: Julia and Oscar Louder- an older couple at Spry Retirement Home- are found hung at the tree while also having purposely ingested several morphine pills. The coroner reported that they did not suffer and most likely died instantly when their necks snapped.\n\n\nThe Glory Point Gazette (The GPG for  short) did not report that during that same Summer the Spry Retirement Home Inhabitants and staff all gossiped about seeing the same couple dancing together in the Bingo Hall with the grace they had in their 30s. \n\n\nJune 8th 1995: The GPG make an inspirational post about a local troubled teen resident being saved from suicide by hanging on the tree by local police.\nWhat the GPG did not report was that that same kid talked for decades that an older couple with bright smiling faces and rope burns around their neck had taken him down. \n\n\nOctober 31st 1971: The GPG report the  first Halloween Massacre. 31 non-residents were found hanging from the tree. All of the corpses were reported to have been skinned alive as there were signs of struggle and thrashing on the exposed raw skin below as they hung. Each flayed person was wrapped in archetypal Halloween costumes such as witches, vampires, werewolves, mummies etc. \n\n\nIt was reported in various small newspapers throughout the US as well as a small article in the Washington Post that 12 of those corpses were found connected to various disappearances across the nation. Evidence found on the corpses opened several cold cases tying them bodies to serial killers that were never caught. 5 more had their homes investigated and there were several buried bodies, under each home. 1 of the 5 had a living victim still alive in their basement who had been severely tortured. The chief torture among them being flaying of the skin of the hands and feet. The others had nothing connected to them.\n\n\nMy brother had a field day with this one. The Halloween Massacre was a common horror story amongst Glory Point inhabitants. Each of the 31 is meant to haunt a certain day of the month of October. Each has their own ritual and superstition attached them such as The Mummy. In that case unless someone dresses up in a mummy costume stays next to the tree from 6pm to 12am on October 1st The Mummy will kill one child in town. The story comes from him being a known child killer after his death who gets one chance a year to have his fun again. \n\n\nOctober 31st 1976 the GPG had a report that 2 teenagers were arrested for disturbing the peace while high on acid during a a Halloween concert near the center of town. \nWhat did not make the Gazette but only traveled through tall tales and ghost stories is that what they saw that night was 31 corpses, dripping with blood. They were clawing at their nooses and making choking gasps while hanging from the tree. \n\n\nFebruary 19th 1896 3 black men were found castrated, covered in tar and flour and hung from the tree. A group of 7 members of the Ku Klux Klan were charged with the crime and subsequently acquitted by the jury. On April of the same year The GPG reported that the infamous defendants of that case were all found castrated, covered in boiling tar with their hoods covering their heads. \n\n\nMy mother had a story about this case. She was a storyteller too, just quieter than my brother. When she had a story to tell there was a quiet dignity to her that made everyone listen in. My brother was a showman while her stories felt more like an intimate confession. \nHers was only one of a few black families that lived in Glory Point in 1974. \n\n\nThe people there were nice and inviting but she would sometimes feel out of place. As she got older she struggled with depression (another trait she shared with my brother). Towards her senior year the stress of staying or leaving made her try self harm on many occasions. (My mother never shied away from dark topics or her own struggles. She wanted us to have the tools and language to deal with our own demons).  \n\n\nShe\u2019d gone to the hanging tree then and she\u2019d almost done what couldn\u2019t be taken back. As she was about to kick the ladder from under her she saw below her the Klansmen. Their blood shot eyes bulged from their white hoods. The shimmery tar covering their skin glistened  white in the moonlight. The eyes looked so hungry. In her panic she slipped from the ladder and began thrashing. She\u2019d kicked the ladder by accident then. \nShe always had to pause at this part. I remember her clenching her mug of coffee so hard that her knuckles turned white. \n\n\nBut she preserved. She said then she felt so much regret that the feeling felt more suffocating than the noose she\u2019d tied around her neck. Worse than that was them. She felt their hands all over her body then. As her vision grew darker and darker she could feel their touch go from a caress to feeling like they were trying to pull the skin from her.\n\nShe understood then that she\u2019d made a mistake. She\u2019d sent herself for her and had no way out. It all grew black then until she opened her eyes. Then she looked up for the first time at my father. He had been crying and was in shock when she saw she was up. The tree was what got my parents together in the first place. The tree is what starts every story in Glory Point. \n\nThe hanging tree is the center of every ghost story in this town. Every legend, tall tale and nightmare was carved from the wood of that tree. But what is the tree really? Why did the heart of my hometown curse it this way? \n\nThe answers are there. But we have to take this slowly, one step at a time. It\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll believe it. It\u2019s the only reason I can. Next, we have to discuss what really happened during the Halloween Massacre, and The Man Who Stole Vengeance from God. \n\n"},"229":{"title":"Tales from Gory Point [Part 1] The Whore ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1go24hi\/tales_from_gory_point_part_1_the_whore\/","flair":"Story","author":"Jmacarerer","selftext":"\nI was the librarian in a town called Glory Point for a long time. It's not a town you could find on a map. Not anymore. I'm the only thing that's left and I need to get some of this stuff out of my head. You all won't believe what happened if I start off with how my town went to Hell so I'll start off with her story first. I'll start with The Whore. I first learned about her from a campfire story that my brother told me and my friends. \n\n\nHe is-was such a fan of the town's tall tales, legends and ghosts. It's what made me take up the job of librarian in the first place. When he disappeared...the only thing that made me feel close to him was being around all that town history. I'll try to honor him by transcribing the story as faithfully as my memory will allow.\n\n\nAround here there are many old stories meant to teach moral lessons. One of my favorites was an old story to scare married young men in town. The kind who had shotgun weddings that didn\u2019t quite put down the lustful beast of their youth. It went like this I believe. If a man were to sleep with another woman in the first year after his vows, he\u2019d see The Whore. Who's The Whore you ask? Well stories vary. Some say she\u2019s the ghost of one of ol\u2019 King Solomon\u2019s wives. Some say she\u2019s one of the devil\u2019s own concubines. \n\n\nMy personal favorite is that she\u2019s Wilma Winters. In the town\u2019s founding, it was still a puritan spot. One that was pure in the town square but quite the opposite behind barn doors. That\u2019s where old Wilma Winters came in. She was apparently the favorite of all of the towns council which included all of the church leadership-even the witchfinder general himself. Some say she grew tired of her sordid reputation and set herself ablaze but I think-given the time period-it was a punishment. \n\n\nThe modern telling was that she was accused of being a witch by one or all of the wives of her lovers\u2019.   It was said in her funeral pyre she made a deal with the devil himself to haunt the town\u2019s adulterers and lead more into Hell to take revenge on the descendants of those who burned her. Hence the Whore was born. Here\u2019s how she operates-I\u2019ll give you her most famous story. The year is 1954, almost 200 years since The Whore was burned. A young Dale Grimm just married some debutante. \n\n\nYou see, despite vowing before friend, family and Heavenly Father- he didn\u2019t even last a week before sleeping with his wife\u2019s sister. In comes The Whore. The first day, Dale only smelled a lovely perfume with the faint scent of burnt skin. The 2nd day he only saw shadows. A slender woman\u2019s shape was always just out of direct sight. The smell grew stronger then. \n\n\nThe third day he saw her eyes peeking up at him with hot lust and cold hate from behind every crack in a door, small storm drain or under his bed. Dale knew the legend. He knew he\u2019d be haunted for as long as he kept his wedding vows. That meant he had only 4 more days, you see. Poor guy sealed his short sentence and he didn\u2019t even particularly enjoy the act. By the 4th day he felt her finger slide slowly down his spine randomly throughout the day. \n\n\nIt was the slow caress of a lover. He also felt her hot frantic breath at his neck as if she were right behind him. The 5th day Dale woke up with full deep furloughs of skin ripped from his back. She\u2019d clawed his so deep he needed medical attention. The bone was exposed and everything. On the 6th day he woke up and couldn\u2019t move. Only stare at her smiling face. She apparently has a \u201csmile\u201d in the same way a snarling ape has a smile. It was all animalistic and hungry. He had to watch as she slowly gingerly brought his right hand up to her mouth. \n\n\nShe made a whole production of gingerly opening pulling up his ring finger right to her lips. She licked the gold band then and gave him a sweet smile right before she bit the finger off. Poor bastard couldn\u2019t move but he could sure feel. She was gone then. On the 7th day he didn\u2019t see her until 8:45 PM. Some versions of the legend say that\u2019s when Wilma Winters was burned and made her deal with Satan but I prefer the legend that she kills you at the time you broke your vows. More poetic that way I suppose. \n\n\nOn that night\u2026well. We don\u2019t quite know. We only have some leaked coroner notes. He had the removed ringer with the golden band shoved so far up his ass it pierced his lower intestine. It\u2019s thought that he was still alive for a while after she did that. Didn\u2019t quite let him bleed out in time for what happened next\u2026The report said his pelvis (and the \u201cequipment\u201d he used to commit his sin) looked a lead ball had been slammed up and down on it until his hip bones were mostly powder and the flesh looked like the leavings a butcher throws out. Up and down up and down. \n\n\nThe Whore lived up to her name. Anyway, the marriage rate here has never been lower. Those who do get hitched tend to have long loyal marriages. However, wherever a man\u2019s lust overrides his duty, The Whore is there, ready to send you to Hell with one more act of adultery. Keep to your vows here, and keep to being one flesh with your wife. Lest you wanna give your flesh to Wilma Winters-The Whore of Glory\u2019s Point.\n\n\nThat was the start of my obsession with the town. All the horror and blood stained history began with her. In a way, I made my own vow that day. A vow to find her and all the things like her in Glory Point. I kept my vows and for that fidelity, I am more damned than poor Dale ever was. You'll know in time.\n"},"230":{"title":"Him.

It's just that I took the easy way out, and it was easy to do because it was logical. It all started with my wife, Dr. Kleidance, completing her archaeology degree and landing a job as an assistant to an influential art broker. We suddenly had a lot of money, and she was making roughly eighteen times more income than I was as a truck driver. Suddenly my CDL was about as impressive as a food handler's permit, compared to her new degree.\n\nMe going back to school, at fifty, was her idea. At first, I felt out of place on campus, but somehow, I became immersed in the lifestyle. I had nothing to do but sit through lectures and write papers. Since I no longer had to worry about pissing clean, I could even own a bong. I'd finish my homework and spend half the day playing in the backyard. It was like an early retirement.\n\nI'd give anything to go back to those days.\n\nFor me, it started while watching television. I was about to change the channel because I didn't want to see more atrocities committed against helpless villagers, with their farms burning in the background and their families and neighbors in a mass grave. That's when I saw the idol, a stack of skulls carved from solid rock, with red sacrifices dripping from it. I blinked, feeling a chill.\n\nI recognized it, but only from my dreams. Somehow it wasn't something far away. I knew it well.\n\nMy wife, Dr. Kleidance, was abroad. I looked at my copy of her itinerary and shuddered. She was just across the border from the insurrection. I calculated it would be early evening over there, and called her hotel. \"No, this is her husband. I'm trying to reach Dr. Kleidance.\" I had to say several times before the phone was handed to someone who spoke English better.\n\n\"I'm sorry for the confusion, Mr. Kleidance. Your wife was taken to hospital. There is a message from her associate, Professor Hujon. It is for you to call directly. She didn't have your number, so you'll have to call. Are you ready to write it?\"\n\nI went to the whiteboard on the fridge and wrote Professor Hujon's number.\n\n\"What happened to Camile?\" I asked when I reached her. Professor Hujon apologized for not having my number ready and expressed relief that I had called.\n\n\"She's having the baby.\" Professor Hujon told me.\n\n\"What baby?\" I asked. I'd seen my wife just six days earlier, she wasn't pregnant.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Professor Hujon sounded confused.\n\n\"My wife wasn't pregnant.\" I stammered. \"How'd you not notice?'\n\n\"I haven't seen her in six months. She was pregnant when I arrived yesterday at the excavation. I must admit I am confused.\" Professor Hujon sounded bewildered.\n\n\"There must be some misunderstanding.\" I complained. \"We are talking about Camile Kleidance, right?\"\n\n\"Yes, and she's giving birth right now. The embassy has sent someone here, at my request. You have nothing to worry about.\" Professor Hujon tried to reassure me.\n\n\"I'm worried about my wife. She wasn't pregnant. Is there some way you can check and make sure there wasn't some kind of mistake?\" I worried.\n\n\"There's no mistake, Mr. Kleidance. Everything is being handled correctly. I just worry that it's a little early, I mean why else would she come here if she was due?\" Professor Hujon sounded a little admonishing.\n\nI slowly, with trembling hands, hung up the phone. I sat down, quite confused. The thought of the soaked altar of skulls kept coming to my mind.\n\nFor the next couple of days, I paced in worry, unable to accept the reality of what I was told over the phone. I tried calling to reach Camile, but somehow my calls never made it to her. Instead, I was left waiting for her arrival.\n\nWhen she came home her dark hair had turned brittle and white, and she looked aged and tired and weak. She carried no baby, and the sunken look in her eyes haunted me. She wouldn't speak or respond to me, and I worried about what had happened to her.\n\nIt was a quiet morning and a gentle snowfall had begun. I'd helped her out of bed and sat her at the small table in our dining area, kitchen adjacent. She just stared at nothing, as though she had never really come home.\n\n\"I love you.\" I said quietly to her. I had no idea how to bring her back, but my heart was breaking, seeing her so traumatized.\n\nSomehow hearing me say that finally got a reaction out of her. She started crying and looked at me. It took a few moments but she said:\n\n\"I'm just glad to be home. It was awful.\"\n\nWe worked on it. She slowly started a recovery, and after some time, just before New Year's, she was holding a warm mug between her hands and said to me: \"I suppose you want to know what happened.\"\n\n\"Only if you feel you could tell me.\" I tried to be reassuring, but I really did need to know.\n\n\"It started when I uncovered the idol of Dwimbhith. It was an old legend, to prove it was a real cult, that was quite the find. There was an accident, one of Professor Hujon's students, she - she fell on it. It was my hand that held the rag to clean the blood off the artifact. That night I experienced terrible pains, and by morning it was like I was four or five months pregnant. By the second day, I was ready to give birth. It was horrible. You see, Michael, the legend is true, and I am damned.\"\n\n\"The statue of skulls?\" I asked, shivering in dread at her morbid tone and slow diction.\n\n\"Dwimbhith was a demon born of seven brides, a bloodthirsty creature. The monks fought it to the last, and managed to behead it of all seven of its heads. Piled together, they turned to stone. That's the legend. Only the blood of believers could ever revive it, and so it was buried, to prevent such a thing. It was just a legend.\" Camile shook her head.\n\n\"What happened, at the hospital?\" I asked. I regretted it when she just sobbed and shook, unable to say what had happened to her at the hospital.\n\nOur home was silent, grave like and under an oppressive atmosphere. My wife spent most of her time in bed, leaving me to my worries and questions. It wasn't long before Dawn Caldwell was trying to reach her, leaving messages of condolence and questions about selling the idol. Was it authentic - or not?\n\nFinally, I was on the phone with Ms. Caldwell. I could only tell her my wife was in no condition to deal with her. I couldn't decipher my wife's recommendation for the acquisition, that it was both certifiably authentic and also that it could not be sold.\n\n\"This is most unfair, Mr. Kleidance. I have several bids approaching six zeroes, and your wife has not signed off on the legality of the sale. This is very unprofessional, and I am unhappy.\" Ms. Caldwell told me she was unhappy like I should be most worried about that unhappiness. I hung up the phone.\n\nThat night I witnessed the beginning of the awful horror with my own eyes. My wife lay in our bed, wracked by some unseen torment. Then, as she quieted down, I watched as her belly grew, and was awake all night in unbelieving dread. By morning she had regained consciousness and looked at me where I had kept sleepless vigil and then to her stomach. She let out a distressed moan, her eyes watered in anguish and terror.\n\n\"Not again.\" Camile sobbed.\n\nI called a doctor and took her to the hospital, but they found nothing strange about her pregnancy and didn't seem to believe us that it had happened overnight. The ultrasound brought a different reaction.\n\n\"There must be something wrong with our equipment.\" the technician apologized and turned off the monitor. I confronted them with the doctor:\n\n\"We need to terminate this thing. It's no child.\" I told them.\n\nThe doctor shook his head. \"That's not possible. Your wife is already due.\"\n\nCamile became hysterical, demanding a cesarean, but the doctors wouldn't budge. They insisted she could easily give birth naturally. It was like some kind of nightmare.\n\nWithin hours she was in labor, and then I saw the thing that had used her body as a gateway to our world. The doctor collapsed in shock and the creature just lay there in the birthing gore, looking up at me with a dark eye with a hellish red iris.\n\nI stared at it, my body in a frozen mutiny of terror, unable to take action. It blinked once and then began to levitate, dripping. It was rotten, a fully grown skull with a bit of the spinal cord and the veins hanging raggedly from the loose skin of its neck. The bone showed through to sagging flesh, but it was impossible. My mind rejected it, and I couldn't recall what compelled me to throw a chair through the window, aiding its escape. It flew out into the snowy night, leaving its mother behind.\n\nThere was a requirement that I had to speak to the police. I didn't know what to tell them. I made up a story that the whole thing was a mistake, and she was never pregnant. I had no idea how the window got broken or how the delivery doctor went insane.\n\nSomehow, we were both sitting there in silence at our table, not long after that awful night at the hospital. We just stared at each other and then there was a knock at our front door. It was Dawn Caldwell with a briefcase.\n\nShe sat with us and demanded answers from my wife, shoving papers in front of her and insisting that she wouldn't leave without a signature. We consigned someone, somewhere, to exposure to the evil artifact. Then Dawn Caldwell left our lives for good, or so I hoped.\n\nDays went by and then one night I found Camile lying on the floor in our hallway, the steam from the shower making the air a moist fog. Something pressed upon her, torturing her. She cried out in agony and I rushed to help her, but there was nothing I could do except watch helplessly in terror.\n\nAgain, she grew pregnant, and it went quickly. I waited sleeplessly, leaving her in our bed. By the next evening, she was giving birth again, and our bedding and mattress was soaked in blood. The head rolled out onto the floor and looked at me menacingly. It opened its mouth, as though savoring the horror of its birth, and then it too floated out of the window as I opened it, letting it go.\n\nI wasn't sure why I helped it escape. I was too afraid to move or react, but somehow, like a puppet, I moved to aid it. When it was gone, I closed the window, shutting out the coldness of the night air.\n\n\"What is happening to us?\" I asked her. Camile just sat staring away without answers. She looked doomed and petrified. I felt a deeply unsettling anxiety that our problems had only just begun.\n\nI needed something to do to resist the silent calamity of my home and set to work dragging the mattress and the bedding to our backyard and burning it spectacularly. When it was over there was a charred mess in a heap back there, but I hoped it was over and we could move on. None of it felt real, except it had happened. I wanted to forget, but every time I closed my eyes, I could see the stare of the things she had birthed.\n\nWhen I went back inside, I found Camile against a wall, her face pushed into it. She was in great distress, something painful was ravaging her. She collapsed into my arms, and I dreaded yet another pregnancy. \"I'm sorry.\" I told her weakly.\n\nShe refused to get up from the floor, so I made her comfortable there. Early the next morning she cried out in labor. Then the fourth of the beheaded horrors arrived. I obediently opened the back door and let it escape, unable to resist the urge to do so.\n\nI found her notebooks and began to read about the legendary excavation site and the demon Dwimbhith. There was little more information than what she had told me. I did, however, see a sketch of the artifact, the altar, and noted it was composed of seven stone heads piled haphazardly. I recognized the awful stare of the demonic eyeballs in the skull sockets, staring with dreadful malevolence.\n\nWe were at its mercy, helplessly trapped in the cycle. Our days went on and on, awaiting the next pregnancy and birth, the next conception and the next. After the last one we sat in silence, praying wordlessly to no particular god that it was finally over. I asked Camile:\n\n\"Is that it, is the legend over?\"\n\nShe shrugged, sipping her tea and staring out at the white blanket of snow outside. She said mysteriously:\n\n\"It lives again, through me. What have I, but to see it through?\"\n\nI had no idea what she meant, but despite the warmth of our home I felt as cold as the world outside. I shivered in fear, unsure what I would do when called upon. I felt like it somehow wasn't over.\n\nIt was then that we were again invaded by Dawn Caldwell. She was distraught and disheveled. She'd sold the idol to a museum, only to be forced to generate a refund, as the artifact crumbled and revealed it was simply seven rotting heads thinly mummified by a layer of mortar painted over them. The real artifact was supposed to be carved entirely of solid stone.\n\n\"You've ruined me, and now I'll ruin you!\" Dawn Caldwell stood between me and my wife, acting indignant and throwing a tantrum.\n\n\"Where are the heads now?\" I asked.\n\n\"What?\" Dawn Caldwell asked.\n\n\"Reunited as one, they are bound to their priests. Those who made them, released them and moved them. Dwimbhith comes.\" Camile smiled weirdly, a crazed look in her eyes. Then she laughed. It was a shattering kind of laugh, of pure madness and horror.\n\nMs. Caldwell looked from us to the darkness over the white snow outside. Something behind the glass held her attention.\n\n\"A bride for the demon's needs, a father who sets the prodigy free. And a nurse who feeds.\" Camile said while she laughed darkly and with mind-rending clarity.\n\nSuddenly, as I watched her, Dawn Caldwell's face became as utter fear, twisted into a silent scream. The climax of the contortion was a piercing shriek and to claw at her own face with her long fingernails. Whatever she was looking at behind us was unbearably horrible, and hungry.\n\nBlood lactated through her power suit and she kicked the dropped briefcase. She ran around in a little circle, disoriented and unable to escape. Then she ran to the back door, somehow towards the menacing creature in our backyard instead of away from it.\n\nI refused to look. I knew it was eating her because I could hear her shrieks of terror and pain as it consumed her whole, starting with her feet, and munching on her until her screams went inside it, wetly muffled. My wife stood up and stared at it.\n\n\"What a beautiful baby. It has its daddy's mouth, seven faces as lips and a single shining tooth from each chin. Indeed, it has one great mouth made of seven heads formed in a circle. It is a lovely one, you should see it.\" Camile described the monster in our backyard.\n\n\"No thanks.\" I told her, staring at the paperwork of the opened briefcase. In her desperation, the boss lady had brought a paper file on her most trusted assistant. She could have filled it out to fire her or promote her or anything. It was like a blank check. I picked it up and clicked the pen.\n\n\"You're going to run the Caldwell Art Dealership from now on. Somebody has got to keep things neat and tidy around here. We have the rest of our lives to forget this.\" I was muttering almost absently, ignoring the cooing of my wife to the thing in our backyard.\n\n\"He's leaving, he's got his own life to live now.\" Camile sounded sad. I heard a sound like great bat wings beating the air for takeoff and then whatever it was had left us there. I finished the paperwork and went and stood next to Camile.\n\nI put my arm around her and held her close as we looked out at the pristine winter wonderland. The tracks of some clawed abomination had left a mark, but the snow began to fall, slowly erasing it. Camile rested her head on my shoulder and sipped her tea as we stood there watching the snow falling.\n\n\"Things will get better, I'm sure. We're through the rough. I think we will be alright.\" I told her, my eyes watering as I desperately wanted to believe in what I was saying. I felt some reassurance when Camile kissed my cheek and said:\n\n\"I know.\""},"232":{"title":"Dusk Will Last Forever.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1gikzbs\/dusk_will_last_forever\/","flair":"Story","author":"Some_Machine_2534","selftext":"A young girl sat in her room, coloring, and trying not to listen to her mom argue with her father\u2019s mother over the phone.

She couldn\u2019t help the tears in her eyes as she listened to her mother shouting about something she didn\u2019t understand. She lifted a shaky hand and wiped away the tears, but they still kept coming back. Eventually she looked out the window to see that it was nighttime. She closed her coloring book and turned off her light and lay down in bed, covering up. She closed her eyes in an attempt to sleep. But something caught her eye before she drifted off. A tall figure, shaded by darkness, standing in the far corner in her room. She blinked, and it was gone. She closed her eyes again, and drifted off to sleep.\n____________________________________\n\nThe girl woke up. She had turned 6 a few weeks ago. She sat up and rubbed her eyes tiredly, and looked out the window next to her bed. The sun was shining. It was morning. She got dressed. Just a purple shirt and some jean shorts. She went to her brother\u2019s room. \u201cMax, can you make me some waffles?\u201d She asked quietly, and small smile on her face. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll be there in a minute. Get out of my room.\u201d He told her, his tone laced with annoyance. She nodded and left his room, going downstairs and sitting at the table. He went in shortly after and made her waffles, plated them, and gave them to her. \u201cThank you\u201d She said, smiling. She ate the waffles and went outside. She played in the forest. It was weird, though. She felt uneasy, as if she were being watched. She played until the sun set, and then went inside. She ate with her brother, just a sandwich. He insulted her a bit for the way she ate, and her mother fussed the both of them. Not much different from every other day. She went to her room and put on a nightgown. She lay in bed with the lights off and closed her eyes. She heard her door open, but, afraid it was her mother, she kept her eyes shut. It was her mother\u2019s boyfriend, though. But she wished it was her mom after what he did to her.\n____________________________________\n\nShe woke up in the morning. She was miserable. She had school today, another day of middle school. She was 12 now. Last night her mom\u2019s boyfriend had done the same thing as every night. Her brother was especially mean to her these days. She yawned as she got dressed into her uniform and went to her bus stop, she skipped breakfast almost every day, no difference today. She rode the bus to school, and got through classes fairly easily. On the way back out of the school was her problem. She ran into a popular group, so they called her names and beat her. She left the school with bruises on her face and arms. She came home to her mother in a screaming match with her brother. She just quickly went to her room and locked herself in. Her ears were ringing and her body was slightly shaking. She went to the bathroom and pulled out her hidden knife, and well\u2026 You probably understand. She covered her wrists with her sleeves and hid the knife. She went back to her room and changed into a white tank top and some grey sweatpants. She drew some, and then she went to bed. Her dream was mostly darkness, and then she heard screaming and then the room lit up. She was killing a woman. She was in a dimly lit dungeon, and surrounded by dead bodies. Then the darkness returned.\n____________________________________\n\nShe woke up, her room lit by the sun. She was 14 now, and she had bleached and dyed her hair white a few weeks ago. She got up and got into her uniform. She was eerily calm today. Not even her bullies wanted to mess with her today. She just seemed so\u2026emotionless. She went home after school and went to her room. She changed into a white cropped tank top and a grey jacket with black sweatpants. She put on some tall black combat boots, and waited. She sat in her room until 12 at night. At exactly 12, she got up. She went to her bathroom and grabbed her small bag of thick, black, sharp needles. She had bought them at a hardware store a few weeks before. She went to her mother\u2019s room, and stabbed a needle through her mother\u2019s head. She pulled the now blood-covered needle out. Her mother was mostly silent, but she was bleeding out. Still slightly conscious, groaning, and slowly dying. Dusk licked the needle clean and smiled at her mother\u2019s now-lifeless body. She laughed slightly. Quietly, almost not at all. She turned from laughing to silence immediately. She went to her brother\u2019s room, and looked at his sleeping body. She smiled again. She opened his closet and pulled out his baseball bat. It was a thick, wooden bat. She stood on his bed, looking down at him. His eyes jolted open as she stared at him. \u201cW-what\u2026 what are you doing..?\u201d Those were his last words before she bashed his head in. She laughed at his body, quietly at first. But then it got louder. And louder. And louder. She finally stopped laughing and grabbed a black mask out of her brother\u2019s closet. It had a white spray-painted clown face on it. She tied the mask on her head and pulled her hood over her head. She left the house. She ran. She ran to her mother\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s house. It was his turn. She went to his door, and busted it open with the bat. He ran into his living room, and her hood fell, revealing her long white hair. \u201cDusk?!\u201d He shouted, shocked. \u201cIt\u2019s Clowny.\u201d And with that, she charged at him, laughing maniacally under the mask. He grabbed the closest thing to him. A knife. She jumped on top of him and tried to stab his shoulder with a needle, but he grabbed her wrist. He used his other hand to try to stab her head, but she dodged and all that was cut was her hair. Half of her hair was chopped short, shoulder length. The shock from her speedy dodge gave her time to attack. She stabbed his shoulder and jumped off. She took the bat and hit his legs, bashing them into pieces. He could no longer move his legs. He screamed as loud as he could, so she grabbed a towel and stuffed it into his mouth. She laughed and took a knife out of his drawer. She scraped the skin on his forehead, leaving it hanging. She began to peel. He screamed, but it was muffled by the towel. She peeled the skin off of his face. She peeled down to his neck. She pulled his pants slightly. She grabbed a butcher knife, and chopped his penis off. She cut the balls off first, and then the penis itself. Then, she put a pot of water on the stove. She set it to boil, laughing as she did so. He screamed in pain through the gag, his throat raw from all the screaming. The sensitive meat under his skin was being exposed to air, and it hurt. She waited for the water to boil and then she took the pot off the stove. She dumped it on his stomach. He screamed through the gag, writhing in agony as the boiling water burned his body. She laughed as he struggled. Finally, after an hour of watching him, she shoved his penis down his throat and watched as he choked to death. She waited a moment in his home before taking her weapons. She put the needles into her pocket and put the bat on her back using a strap. She went to his bathroom and cut her hair short. She made it a shoulder-length wolf cut. She went to his garage and found some matches. She lit a match, and threw it into a wooden part in front of his house. She walked away as the house and his body burned."},"233":{"title":"The Dark Lullaby of Ashgrove Asylum","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1gc8gev\/the_dark_lullaby_of_ashgrove_asylum\/","flair":"Story","author":"Verlac_1","selftext":"On a foggy October night, my three friends and I stood outside the abandoned Ashgrove Asylum, its shadow stretching over us like some silent, lurking beast. The building loomed in the darkness, its cracked stone walls swallowed by ivy, windows shattered into sharp, jagged teeth. People called this place cursed.\n\nLegends swirled around Ashgrove, tales passed down for generations about the mysterious disappearance of Nurse Evelyn Crane. She was a kind woman, they said, who cared for the patients as if they were family. But one night, she vanished, leaving only a chilling lullaby that echoed through the halls. It became known as \u201cThe Nurse\u2019s Rhyme,\u201d a twisted warning that haunted the memories of the few who dared to enter.\n\nThe words of her rhyme were whispered like a ghost story around campfires: \u201cNurse comes for those who wander\u2026 Nurse comes to take you under\u2026\u201d Some said that those who heard it were doomed to wander the asylum\u2019s halls forever, trapped in a trance, just as Nurse Crane was.\n\nWe\u2019d laughed it off, all of us, but now as we pushed open the rusty doors, our laughter had faded. We stepped inside, and a biting chill wrapped around us immediately, as if the asylum itself were breathing.\n\nThe air was thick with the stench of mold and rot. The silence was so heavy it felt as though the whole building was waiting, listening to us. I could hear our footsteps echo off the cracked tiles, each step a reminder of how alone we were. Or how alone we should have been.\n\nAfter a few minutes of walking, Ethan\u2019s flashlight flickered and went out. He cursed, shaking it, but it stayed dark. \u201cBatteries were new,\u201d he muttered, his voice thin, almost swallowed by the silence. Just then, I thought I heard something, a faint whisper, so soft it was barely there, floating from the end of the corridor. My heart began to pound as a shiver crawled up my spine. I tried to convince myself it was the wind, but deep down, I knew better. We all did.\n\nWe moved deeper into the asylum, the long corridors narrowing around us, and eventually reached what looked like an old operating room. The walls were painted with peeling gray paint, stained with something too dark to be rust. I felt the temperature drop again, as if the room itself were swallowing the warmth. Shadows clung to the walls, thick and unmoving. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw something flicker, a dark shape darting along the edges of my vision. I gasped, stepping back, bumping into Jake. \u201cDid you see that?\u201d I whispered, though I could barely breathe.\n\nBut no one had seen anything, only me. Still, we all felt it. The weight pressing in on us, like something terrible had just brushed past. The air seemed to thicken, wrapping around us, filling our lungs with an icy dread.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Sara whispered, her voice barely audible, and we all nodded, silently grateful for the excuse to leave. But as we turned toward the door, it slammed shut, the sound echoing through the darkened halls like a gunshot. I lunged for the handle, pulling as hard as I could, but it wouldn\u2019t budge. My hands grew cold and clammy, each tug at the door leaving my heart pounding faster. A sudden gust of icy wind tore through the room, and that was when I heard it\u2026an eerie lullaby, so faint and twisted that it sounded like it was coming from the walls themselves.\n\nI turned to look at Jake, and a chill froze me to the bone. His face had gone slack, his eyes empty and unfocused, as though he were staring straight through me. Then his mouth opened, and in a soft, sing-song voice I didn\u2019t recognize, he began to mutter, \u201cNurse comes for those who wander\u2026 Nurse comes to take you under\u2026\u201d\n\nMy stomach twisted. I grabbed his arm, trying to shake him, but he just kept muttering, his voice growing softer, his eyes unfocused, fixed on something I couldn\u2019t see. Ethan and I pushed on the door again, slamming our shoulders into it, but it wouldn\u2019t move. The walls seemed to close in, shadows reaching out from the corners, stretching toward us like hands clawing for skin.\n\nAnd then the footsteps began. Slow, careful footsteps, echoing down the hall. They grew louder, each one more measured, each one more intentional, like something, or someone, was coming for us. And the lullaby\u2026 it grew louder, wrapping around us like a suffocating fog. I could feel a cold, lingering presence slide across my skin, the touch of fingers that weren\u2019t there, and a terrible realization settled in my chest, squeezing my heart with icy fingers. We hadn\u2019t found the ghost; the ghost had found us.\n\nI grabbed Sara and Ethan, shouting that we had to go, but they just stared back at me with blank, hollow expressions. Their eyes had that same glassy look Jake\u2019s did, empty, like they weren\u2019t seeing me anymore. Desperate, I shook each of them, screaming their names, but they only muttered softly, voices blending with the twisted lullaby filling the air, \u201cNurse comes for those who wander\u2026 Nurse comes to take you under.\u201d Their gazes drifted past me toward the approaching footsteps.\n\nI backed away, feeling trapped, surrounded by the encroaching darkness and my friends\u2019 haunted faces. I didn\u2019t want to leave them, but the dread was crushing me, pushing me toward the door. I turned and ran, throwing my weight against the door with a final, desperate shove, and somehow, it gave way.\n\nI stumbled into the hallway, glancing back one last time to see the shadows swallowing them, wrapping around my friends like tendrils of smoke. Their faces faded, their eyes lifeless, fixed on something just beyond the darkness. I called out, but they didn\u2019t respond, and the cold crept closer.\n\nAnd then the door slammed shut, locking them inside.\n\nI ran down the empty corridors, my footsteps echoing, the lullaby following me like a ghostly whisper. I didn\u2019t stop until I was outside, gasping for air, the asylum towering behind me, dark and silent.\n\nThey never came out. The last thing I heard, echoing in my mind, was my friend\u2019s voices, barely a whisper in the darkness\u2026\u201d Nurse comes for those who wander\u2026Nurse comes to take you under\u2026\u201d"},"255":{"title":"There Was Something Playing My Theremin","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1gog62d\/there_was_something_playing_my_theremin\/","flair":"Story","author":"dlschindler","selftext":"The first time I heard it, I was just practicing. Just doing my usual thing\u2014hand up, hand down, keeping my movements soft, careful, letting the sound drift out like silk. The theremin\u2019s tone is so fragile, like a breath that could stop at any moment if you\u2019re not gentle with it. That's what I loved about it, I think. It was just me and the air, and the tiny vibrations between us. No one to see, no one to judge.\n\nI was alone in my practice spot, this clearing out in the trees. It was quiet, with sunlight slipping through the branches, turning the dust into tiny golden stars. The first notes floated up, high and thin, and I started to feel that warmth inside, the one that made me feel like maybe I was safe, even here in these woods, even with all the other campers wandering around.\n\nBut then\u2014no, this sounds ridiculous I'd say\u2014then I thought I heard something. Just\u2026 a whisper, faint and shivering, almost like it was hiding behind the music.\n\nI lowered my hand, the note slipping away, and listened. Nothing but the wind stirring through the pines, and yet I felt something\u2026not so much watching as listening. I took a deep breath, told myself to shake it off. Still, I kept glancing over my shoulder the whole way back to camp.\n\nThat night, I lay awake, staring at the ceiling, my nerves buzzing. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the whisper, replaying it in my mind even though it was just a sound, barely even there. I\u2019d convinced myself it was all in my head until Sam leaned over her bunk and asked, \u201cYou heard it, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nI turned, and she was looking at me with this weird little smile, like she knew exactly what I\u2019d been thinking about. \u201cHeard what?\u201d I mumbled.\n\n\u201cThe Weaver.\u201d Her voice was just a whisper. \u201cEveryone knows about it. The Weaver\u2019s\u2026 a thing that lives in the forest, a kind of creature, or maybe a spirit, no one knows for sure. It\u2019s supposed to prey on people like us\u2014on musicians. Especially musicians with\u2026 well, you know. Secrets.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t know about my secrets, of course, but I felt a chill slip over me anyway. \u201cWhat\u2026 what does it do?\u201d\n\nShe leaned in closer, her eyes wide. \u201cIt can take on any shape, any form, anything you\u2019re afraid of. And if it finds you, if it latches onto you\u2026 it starts to play\u00a0*you*. Your fears, your thoughts, your music. It turns it all into its song, and you can\u2019t do anything but listen as it twists you into\u2026 whatever it wants.\u201d She sat back, smirking, like it was just another campfire story.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t sleep that night. The idea of something that could twist my music, make it into something I\u2019d never choose, something that wasn\u2019t me\u2014I hated it. And worse, I couldn\u2019t help feeling like Sam had been right, like the Weaver had already noticed me. Like it had already begun.\n\nThe next day, everything felt\u2026 wrong. The sunlight was too bright, the forest too still. My theremin, normally my only source of comfort, felt heavy in my hands, and my music\u2026 my music didn\u2019t sound like mine anymore. Each note came out different than I wanted, the sounds drifting into strange, unsettling tones, like they were being stretched and pulled by something invisible. And the whispers\u2014they were back, too, sliding between the notes, too faint for anyone else to hear.\n\nI told myself it was just nerves, just my stupid imagination. But then I heard it: my name.\n\n*Amelia.*\n\nMy blood ran cold. The voice was soft, distant, like it had been carried on the wind, but I knew it was real. I knew it was calling me.\n\nThat night, I lay in bed, too scared to close my eyes. But the whispers came anyway, slipping into my thoughts like they\u2019d waited for me. And then, faintly, I heard my theremin. A single note, low and eerie, drifting through the cabin like a dark lullaby. My heart pounded, and I squeezed my eyes shut, but the music grew louder, twisting itself into something awful, something wrong.\n\nIt was my music, but it wasn\u2019t. The notes coiled and warped, bending into a melody I\u2019d never played. A horrible, hollow feeling washed over me, as though the Weaver was reaching inside, taking my hands, making me play its song. I tried to move, to scream, but my body wouldn\u2019t obey.\n\nIt was as if I\u2019d become an instrument myself.\n\nThe Weaver\u2019s instrument.\n\nAnd as the music wrapped around me, filling me with dread, I felt myself slipping, like I was being pulled into the sound, becoming part of it, disappearing into its song.\n\nI thought maybe it was just me. The whispers, the eerie twists in my music, that creeping feeling of something watching. But by the third day, it was clear I wasn\u2019t the only one. Strange things were happening all around camp, things no one could explain.\n\nFirst, there was Ethan, the cellist, normally so calm and unflappable. He\u2019d been fine that morning, practicing in the open field by the lake. But when he came back to the cabin after lunch, he looked pale, his hands shaking as he set down his cello. He tried to play through it, but his fingers stumbled, scratching out sour notes, as if something in his music had gone wrong. Later, I heard him mumbling to himself in the cabin, words I couldn\u2019t make out, like he was arguing with someone who wasn\u2019t there.\n\nThen, one of the flute players, Sarah, had a breakdown during a rehearsal. She\u2019d played fine\u2014beautifully, even\u2014but suddenly she just stopped, her eyes wide and unfocused, clutching her flute like it was the only thing keeping her safe. She claimed she\u2019d seen someone in the woods watching her, someone that looked exactly like her, only with hollow, empty eyes. By the time the counselors reached her, she was sobbing, completely inconsolable.\n\nThe Weaver had started weaving its web.\n\nI tried not to think about Sam\u2019s story, the one about the Weaver preying on musicians with 'secrets'. But the more I saw, the harder it became to ignore. It was like the whole camp had fallen under a spell. Each day, someone else would drift off, or stumble back from their practice spot looking dazed, hollow, like they\u2019d left something behind in the woods that they couldn\u2019t get back.\n\nAnd at night, the whispers grew louder.\n\nEvery time I closed my eyes, I heard it\u2014the faint, taunting hum of my theremin. Notes I didn\u2019t remember playing echoed in my mind, low and twisted, wrapping around my thoughts like spider silk. My dreams were filled with shadows, each one tugging at my hands, pulling at my voice, trapping me in endless, dark corridors filled with music I didn\u2019t recognize as my own.\n\nBy the fifth day, I couldn\u2019t even bring myself to practice. I stayed in my cabin, but even there, I could feel the Weaver\u2019s presence. It had found its way into our minds, spinning webs made of our fears and memories, as though each of us were an instrument for it to pluck and pull.\n\nThere was that\u00a0night, Sam woke up screaming, gasping for breath like she\u2019d been drowning. \u201cIt\u2026 it was here,\u201d she whispered, her face ashen. \u201cI saw it. It took my face, Amelia. It looked just like me.\u201d\n\nNone of us could sleep after that.\n\nLater that night, I found Sam sitting by herself near the fire pit, her face pale and drawn. She hadn\u2019t spoken much about the whispers, but I could see the strain in her eyes, the way she avoided making eye contact with anyone.\n\nI sat next to her, uncertain of what to say, but something in me pushed past the fear. \u201cSam?\u201d I asked softly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to hide it, you know. I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m scared too.\u201d\n\nHer eyes flickered up at me, and I saw something raw there\u2014a vulnerability, like she had been carrying it all alone. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell anyone,\u201d she whispered, voice cracking. \u201cI thought if I did, it would just make it worse. But\u2026 I hear the music, Amelia. I hear it, and I feel like I\u2019m losing myself. Like I\u2019m becoming a part of it.\u201d\n\nI felt my heart ache for her. I understood that fear more than she knew. That fear of being consumed by something you couldn\u2019t control, something that played with your mind until you couldn\u2019t tell what was real anymore. I put a hand on her shoulder, my own voice trembling. \u201cYou\u2019re not alone, Sam. We can face it together. All of us.\u201d\n\nOver the next few days, I saw the same fear in the faces of other campers, the quiet ones who kept to themselves. Slowly, they began to open up. And each time they did, I realized how much I had in common with them\u2014the same vulnerability, the same fear, the same dread of being controlled, manipulated by something we couldn\u2019t understand.\n\nTogether, we started talking more, sharing our experiences. Some of the others had heard the music, too. Some had felt the shadows closing in. One girl, Eliza, spoke about the feeling of being watched while playing her flute, and how every note felt like it was being pulled out of her, twisted in the air before it could reach its proper pitch. Another camper, Marcus, said he\u2019d seen the shadows follow him, the way they slipped behind trees, always lurking just out of sight.\n\nI listened, I absorbed, and for the first time since arriving, I felt a flicker of strength deep inside me. These were my people. We weren\u2019t alone in this. There was something in the way they shared their fears that made them all seem less like victims, and more like fighters. And I knew that I had to do everything in my power to help them fight back against The Weaver.\n\nWhen I finally spoke, my voice was steadier than I\u2019d expected. \u201cThe Weaver, it\u2019s controlling us, manipulating us. But it only has power because we\u2019re afraid. We have to face it, together. We can\u2019t let it win.\u201d\n\nThe group rallied around me, and I saw a spark of hope in their eyes. My sensitivity, the very thing I had always viewed as a weakness, had become a bridge\u2014connecting me to them, and them to each other. It wasn\u2019t just fear we were sharing. It was strength. It was understanding. We were all in this fight together.\n\nThen that moment sorta leaked away, and the reality of our daily nightmare rolled in. Where I'd felt strong and supported I suddenly felt alone and weak. Maybe this was just because I felt like I was reliving the helpless silence that I had suffered through when I was younger, my secret, or maybe it was the Weaver exploiting those feelings of helplessness. It felt like some kind of trap either way.\n\nWe were trapped, like flies caught in a web, held by invisible threads that tugged at us in the dead of night. The Weaver didn\u2019t just watch us\u2014it\u00a0*played*\u00a0us, each of us caught in its dark, twisted melody. And the more it pulled, the emptier we felt, as though something inside us was slipping away, being stolen note by note.\n\nAt one point I actually tried to tell myself I was imagining it, that it was just a story, but deep down, I knew the truth. The Weaver was no myth. It was real. And it was here, lurking in the shadows, taking pieces of each of us until there would be nothing left but silence.\n\nI was shaking when I walked into the big counselor\u2019s office. Everything in me wanted to turn back, to go back to the cabin and pretend that none of this was happening. But the silence\u2014the way nobody would talk to the adults about the strange things happening around camp\u2014reminded me too much of before. Of the times things had happened, and everyone had just\u2026 kept quiet about it.\n\nThe counselor looked up, a little surprised to see me. \u201cAmelia? What\u2019s going on?\u201d Her voice was calm, but I saw her eyes narrow a bit as I started to explain.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2026\u201d I hesitated, forcing myself to keep talking. \u201cI keep hearing weird music. Not mine. It\u2026 it comes from somewhere else. And there are shadows that move when no one\u2019s there. I feel like\u2026 like something\u2019s watching us.\u201d\n\nShe studied me, and for a brief second, I thought she might believe me. But her expression shifted, her brows knitting together like I was saying something embarrassing. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 quite an imagination you have, Amelia. Why don\u2019t we call your aunt? Maybe she\u2019d like to come pick you up.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! I\u2019m not making this up!\u201d My voice came out louder than I\u2019d meant, and the surprise in her eyes twisted into something closer to pity. The look that told me she thought I was just a troubled kid, a problem to be solved by sending me home.\n\nMy stomach turned in knots. She didn\u2019t believe me. Nobody ever did.\n\nThe big counselor went to the front of camp's office, to use the phone there, with her back to me. She was already dialing my aunt\u2019s number, speaking in that soft, careful tone people use when they think you\u2019re just overreacting. I could practically feel the walls closing in around me, the way they had before, the same way they did whenever people refused to see what was right in front of them.\n\n\"It's going to be okay, Amelia. This happens to a lot of new campers. It's her option to come get you if you're having a problem.\"\n\nDesperation clawed up my spine, and as her voice droned on into the phone, my eyes wandered to the bookshelf. That\u2019s when I saw it\u2014a small, leather-bound journal with \u201cCamp Black Hollow \u2013 1963\u201d written on the cover. Something about it made my heart skip. Sam had mentioned a journal she\u2019d seen once in the counselor\u2019s office, one that held old, forgotten stories about the camp. Stories she\u2019d overheard the counselor say shouldn\u2019t be read by 'impressionable kids'.\n\nBefore I could second-guess myself, I slid over to the shelf, slipped the journal out, and tucked it under my sweater. I took a deep breath, steeling myself, and in one quick movement, I climbed out the open window and darted away from the office, my heart racing as I ran back to my cabin.\n\nInside, the world felt quiet again, but I couldn\u2019t shake the pounding in my chest. I held the journal close, feeling its rough edges press into my hands. I could just leave. I could run from this, let my aunt come and pick me up, leave the other campers to\u2026 whatever this was.\n\nBut I knew what happened when I ignored the things that frightened me. I knew how silence and ignorance could allow an atrocity continue. I couldn\u2019t leave Sam and the others alone with whatever was out there. Not if I could do something\u2014anything\u2014to stop it.\n\nHands trembling, I opened the journal. The pages were filled with spidery, slanted handwriting. My breath caught as I read the first few entries, which described strange dreams and music that echoed in the dark, voices that whispered in the trees. The final pages were even more frantic, describing a creature called the Weaver, a thing that preyed on musicians, wrapping its threads around their minds until they became something twisted, something broken.\n\n*August 10th. There\u2019s a talisman in the woods, hidden at the edge of the lake. They say it can repel the Weaver and seal its portal. I don\u2019t know if I can find it, but I have to try. I can\u2019t let it take any more of us.*\n\nI felt a chill run down my spine as I closed the journal, gripping it tightly. I didn\u2019t know if I could find this talisman, or if it was even real. But I knew one thing: I couldn\u2019t just run away. I had to try.\n\nTomorrow, at dawn, I\u2019d go to the lake.\n\nI woke with a start, shivering in the cold. The cabin was still dark, and the air felt heavy, like the night was clinging to the walls, refusing to let go. I couldn't remember when I had fallen asleep, only that I hadn't slept well, not really. My head was a mess\u2014thoughts and whispers all tangled together, so much uncertainty. The terror of what I had seen... what I had almost become... it still clung to me like a fog. I was shivering, but I wasn\u2019t sure if it was from the cold or something deeper, something wrong inside me.\n\nThe faint light of dawn had barely broken through the windows, casting pale, fragmented patterns across the floor. I felt disconnected from myself, as if I were watching my own hands move as I dressed, each motion slow and deliberate, as if I could stop time if I willed it. The chill outside seemed to creep into my bones as I stepped out of the cabin, the cold air biting at my skin. The ground was damp from the night, but I barely felt the earth beneath me as I walked, my mind too focused on what I needed to do.\n\nI had to find the talisman.\n\nBut as I stepped into the clearing, something felt off. Like I wasn\u2019t entirely there. My body moved as if it had a mind of its own, and I was only an observer. Was I really awake? Was this real, or was I watching myself as I had watched myself fall into this nightmare?\n\nI couldn\u2019t tell anymore.\n\nThe camp around me was still mostly silent. The cabins were dark, the campers still asleep, unaware of what had happened the night before\u2014or maybe they did, but they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to speak of it. The darkness that hung over the camp, like a cloud, seemed to block out the early morning light, the patches of midnight lingering like black cobwebs in the corners of my mind. The air was thick with something I couldn\u2019t explain, and it made my stomach churn.\n\nI couldn\u2019t stop. I had to keep going.\n\nI pushed through the forest, each step slower than the last, until I reached the edge of the lake. The journal had said something about the talisman being near here, but how could I find it? What was I even looking for? A stone? A charm? The description was maddeningly vague. The earth felt cold beneath my feet, and the trees loomed over me like silent witnesses to the horrors I couldn\u2019t escape.\n\nThe silence was suffocating. The only sound was the rustling of leaves in the breeze, and my breath\u2014ragged, shallow\u2014as I tried to make sense of everything. But there was no sense. I was grasping at shadows.\n\nAnd then, I felt it.\n\nThe air grew thick, pressing against my skin, my chest tightening. A whisper, faint but unmistakable, like a breath in the dark.\n\n\u201cAmelia\u2026\u201d\n\nI froze. The whisper was inside my head, too close to my ear, like it was coming from behind me. My heart began to pound as I turned, my eyes straining to find the source. But the forest was still, eerily so. No movement. No shape. No sound\u2014except for the one that crept into my thoughts, slithering, growing louder.\n\n\u201cAmelia\u2026\u201d The voice was colder now, more insistent, as though it had been waiting for me. Waiting for me to hear it.\n\nI could feel it. The Weaver.\n\nIt was watching me. Waiting. The very air seemed to twist around me, bending to its will. The shadows stretched out, shifting, pooling into shapes I couldn\u2019t quite understand. I wanted to scream, but the words caught in my throat. My body was frozen, each movement sluggish, like the very forest was holding me in place.\n\nAnd then, I heard my aunt\u2019s voice\u2014louder this time, sharp and real.\n\n\u201cAmelia!\u201d\n\nI snapped my head to the side, blinking, confused. She was there, standing just outside the clearing, her figure framed by the dim, early light. She was real. She was here.\n\n\u201cAmelia, come here! NOW!\u201d\n\nHer voice was cutting through the fog of terror, pulling me back. Without thinking, I turned and ran toward her, the fear still hot on my heels, but her voice was my anchor, pulling me away from the nightmare. The ground seemed to push against me as I ran, as if the earth itself was reluctant to let me go. The dark trees whispered, reaching for me, but I couldn\u2019t stop. I couldn\u2019t look back.\n\nI stumbled into my aunt\u2019s arms, and she wrapped them around me so tightly, I could hardly breathe, but it didn\u2019t matter. I needed her. I needed her warmth. Her presence was the only thing that felt real anymore.\n\n\u201cShh, it\u2019s okay. You\u2019re safe now,\u201d she murmured, her voice steady, grounded. She didn\u2019t ask me anything. She didn\u2019t need to.\n\nI couldn\u2019t look at the camp again, couldn\u2019t bear to think about it. The Weaver was still there. Still waiting for me to return, to fall into its grip again.\n\nI let my aunt guide me away from the woods, away from the camp. The first light of dawn was creeping through the trees, but it didn\u2019t feel like morning. It felt like the world was holding its breath, suspended between night and day, waiting for something terrible to happen. But I wasn\u2019t going to let it.\n\nI left everyone behind. I knew I had. Sam, Eliza, Marcus\u2014they were still there, still in the grip of whatever had taken them. Whatever had almost taken me.\n\nBut I couldn\u2019t go back. I couldn\u2019t save them.\n\nAs the car pulled away, I looked out the window, my chest tight, knowing that something terrible was still out there, in the shadows, and I was leaving it behind.\n\nBut as my aunt squeezed my hand, I couldn\u2019t shake the thought that I would be okay. For now."},"256":{"title":"Yuki-Musume part 1","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1gobbb7\/yukimusume_part_1\/","flair":"Story","author":"Midnight1899","selftext":"Hi guys! After moreless silently watching this subreddit, I spontaneously decided to give it a go and write my own creepypasta. However, this is my first time writing a story in English, so it is far from as good as it could be. Hope you like it anyways.^ ^\n\nOnce upon a time - No. This is not a fairy tale. Fairy tales might be cruel, but they have a happy ending. I\u2019m not sure what exactly the ending of this story is, but it\u2019s definitely not happy.\nIt is the story of a young girl. At daytime, the sun would make sure to always shine on her in just the right way to accentuate the ice-like color of her eyes and let her fair skin sparkle like the snow. At night, the clouds wouldn\u2019t dare to cover the stars and the stars would do their best to outshine each other just to catch her attention. Safe to say she was one of the most beautiful creatures to ever exist. And as much as Mother Nature loved her, she loved Mother Nature. Whenever she didn\u2019t have to work on her father\u2019s farm, she would run into the forest, swim in the lake or make snow angels wherever she was. The people in her village called her Yuki-Musume. Daughter of the snow. That and she was named after her mother Yuki, who had vanished a few years prior.\n\nOne morning, a man came running down into the village, yelling from the top of his lungs: \"Help! She killed Akaya!\u201c Akaya was one of the elders. He and his grandson Haruto - the one who called for help - went out on this freezing day yesterday to get more firewood. Haruto came to a halt in front of Yuki-Musume\u2018s home right when her father Minokichi opened the door, Yuki and her siblings behind him. \"What happened?\u201c, he asked in an alarmed voice. Haruto took a few seconds to catch his breath before he explained: \"My grandpa, he \u2026 He\u2019s dead! Frozen solid!\u201c Minokichi told his children to stay inside and without further ado, the two men hurried to get to where Akaya and Haruto had been staying. Upon arrival, Minokichi froze in shock. The hut they had chosen to spend the night at had a ghostly blue shimmer to it. It was over and over covered in a thick layer of ice and where once was the door, a giant hole gaped into the abyss."},"257":{"title":"The boy in the basement (by me) ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1ghzmvb\/the_boy_in_the_basement_by_me\/","flair":"Story","author":"Ok_Friend_2323","selftext":"\n\n\u201cLittle pig, little pig. Let me in\u201d said my sleepwalking father at the basement door. Almost every night he would do this, so I got used to it. I still thought it was strange because it happened abruptly after he went to the basement after hearing scratching sound, after that day he became disconnected from everyone and spent most of his days reading about the house's history, i wasn't ever aloud so see this research because he said it was to depressing for a young kid even though I\u2019ve could of moved out a while ago but I was to worried about him and it was a good decision.\n One night I heard a tumble and went down stairs and saw the usually locked basement door was opened with my father laying at the bottom of the stairs whispering and laughing saying \u201che let me in.\u201d I rushed him to the hospital. The doctor said he had a broken arm and a concussion. I told them what happened and they said he was going to stay for at least a week, but I knew that a week would turn into a month. I got a phone call and they told me his mental state was progressively getting worse, he was screaming about a boy who resided in our basement who finally accepted him to help, he called him his little pig like from the old kids story. My father never told me that story even as a child. I soon went to the hospital and got his belongings. It consists of his pajamas, robe, glasses, and the study\u2019s key. Like I said I wasn't even allowed to go in there because that's where he keeps all of his stuff. My father was a writer and spent a lot of his time here and working on his book but since that day he has gone to the basement. I\u2019ve heard him talking about his new book that was a documentary about our house which I've always thought would be boring and wouldn\u2019t be much there.\nI had a feeling that I shouldn\u2019t go in there but my curiosity got the best of me. Once I got home I stood at my father's study\u2019s door and slowly unlocked the door. What I saw had me shaking. The walls were covered in drawings and scribbles of a boy with goat eyes and missing his mouth. I wasn't expecting to see this or did I realize how far off the deep end my father has gone. I searched that room for hours, then once I almost gave up I saw something shining under the bookshelf. It was the basement key at first I didn't think about it but how did the locked basement open if the key was in here? It was actually very strange, I didn't remember locking the door when I left for the hospital but it was locked. I didn't want to go down there even if I was curious. Every morning I\u2019d go downstairs to the kitchen which is where the door to the basement is. I've tried to avoid that door because it gives me chills down my spine. \nIt was about a week since father went to the hospital and I\u2019ve started having weird nightmares of me going down to the basement and bloody footprints chasing me up the stairs then the door slamming in my face then I'd wake up. It's been happening every night and I\u2019ve started to fear going to sleep. One day I found my father\u2019s computer still had tabs open, a lot of them were about our house. It said that there was a couple with a mute son, the father hated the son because the son had a condition that caused his iris to be misshapen and goat-like, he said he wasn\u2019t his son and was a demon disguised as his son. The mother couldn\u2019t handle the father\u2019s abuse to the boy so she left and she tried to take the boy but the father hid him because he didn\u2019t want what he thought was in the boy to hurt the mother, so he put the boy in the basement. Since the boy was mute he couldn't scream for help and with the basement being locked the police couldn't get in so they assumed no one was there because there was no noise. The boy died from falling from the basement window and landing on the broken wooden chair where he was stabbed in the back. When they found the boy's body, on the wall written in blood it said \u201chelp me.\u201d \nReading about the past residents made me want to get out of there as fast as I could but there was something that was drawing me to stay. Another week passed and I've started waking up in front of the basement door like my father did. I gave in and used the key to go down there even though I didn't want to, but I felt like I needed to. I started to walk down the steps and with each step I took it got colder and colder. I was soon at the point of shivering. Then I finally got to the bottom of the stairs. Looking around from where I was standing I could tell something was off. The floor was dusty, it was darker than I was expecting, and the only light was the basement window.  I took my first step on the floor. It was freezing cold, the dust stuck to the bottom of my socks. The more I worked my way through the room the more I got the feeling of being watched. I began to smell a strong stench. It didn\u2019t come to mind until I saw \u201cdon't run\u201d written in a red subsistence. It was placed under the only window down there, so the light would make it glisten and easier to see. It took a moment for my brain to realize that the red subsistence was blood. It was fresh because it was still dripping down the wall. I wanted to run but my body was frozen in fear. Soon another wall had writing on it as well, but this time I watched it get written out. Out of the corner of my eye I could see each word get shakingly placed. The entity that was doing this wasn't seen only the blood soaked words. \nI got the strength to move my head to get a better look of what it said. It said \u201cfriends?\u2019 it was taken back from this, personally i was expecting \u201cget out\u201d or \u201cdie.\u201d Somehow reading that gave me a sense of relaxation but it only went so far. The entity softly brushed the back of my neck like it was beckoning an answer. So I gave it one, I shaked my head out of fear that if I waited too long what it would do to me, but it instead showed itself to me. It was a pale, skinny, teenage boy, he was wearing a shirt that was way too large for him, and a pair of worn down socks. The thing that was remembered most vividly was his face, he had goat like shaped irises and no mouth. It actually looked like his skin grew over it but I could see he was smiling. I saw him erase the wall in front of me and spell out \u201cdon't fear.\u201d He looked hopeful that say or I mean writing that would make me feel better and to be honest strangely it did, but I still was terrified. After looking me over he started back at the wall and wrote out \u201cname?\u201d I was able to get my words together and told him it was \u201cMerdith\u201d he smiled again at this then wrote beside \u201cAlex.\u201d \u201cIs that your name?\u201d he knotted with excitement. I wasn't expecting a boy to be haunting my basement. I thought it would be a giant disgusting monster demon thing. \nWe talked, I mean I talked and he shaked his head yes or no to my questions. I guess my father was being tormented by the boy because he reminded him of his father or the man who locked him down there. I told him that my father would never do that and that he was a good man, he was screaming about helping the boy. I saw Alex begin to shiver and tear up, I told him it was ok, I understood why he felt that way, and I wasn\u2019t upset. To be honest I was kind of frustrated but I still understood his feelings like I said.\n"},"258":{"title":"The Last Halloween","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1gge183\/the_last_halloween\/","flair":"Story","author":"Verlac_1","selftext":"Halloween used to be our favorite night of the year. But as we got older, the magic wore off. The thrill of trick-or-treating was a thing of the past, and haunted houses didn\u2019t scare us like they used to. So, when Sam suggested we all meet at his place to \u201creclaim Halloween\u201d last year, we mostly shrugged it off. We were seventeen, too old for all that, but hanging out sounded better than spending the night scrolling on our phones.\n\nThe four of us:Sam, Maya, Eli, and me, met up in Sam\u2019s basement. We tossed around the idea of watching a horror movie marathon, maybe telling some ghost stories. But then Maya, grinning with a nervous kind of excitement, pulled out something she\u2019d been hiding in her backpack: an old, battered Ouija board. This wasn\u2019t the cheap plastic kind you get at the store. No, this was something ancient-looking, carved from dark wood, with letters and symbols scratched in by hand.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019d you get that?\u201d I asked, eyeing it warily.\n\nMaya shrugged. \u201cAntique shop near the edge of town. The owner tried to tell me not to buy it, said it had a \u2018dark history\u2019 or something\u201d she said with a laugh. \n\nSam chuckled. \u201cCome on, we\u2019re not kids anymore. A board game\u2019s not going to scare us.\u201d\n\nWe set the board down on the ground, and I felt a chill settle over me. The basement felt darker, colder, as though something had shifted the moment the board appeared. But not wanting to be the one who chickened out, I joined them around the table, placing my fingers on the heavy planchette. I could feel the weight of it, cold and strangely rough, pressing against my fingertips.\n\nMaya took a deep breath, her voice barely a whisper. \u201cIs anyone here with us?\u201d\n\nAt first, nothing happened. We exchanged glances, half-smiling, trying to shake off the creeping sense of dread. But then, slowly, the planchette began to move, dragging our fingers along with it. It spelled out Y-E-S.\n\nI tried to pull my hand away, but it felt stuck, as though something cold and invisible was pressing it to the board. The room grew colder, and a sour, stale smell filled the air, something rotten and damp that made me want to gag.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2026 who are you?\u201d I managed to stammer, my voice barely audible.\n\nThe planchette moved again, spelling out F-R-I-E-N-D. The word seemed to mock us, each letter pressing into my mind, chilling me to the core. Eli tried to laugh it off, but his voice was shaky. \u201cJust some prank. One of you guys is moving it,\u201d he muttered, though he looked as terrified as I felt.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Maya asked, her face pale, her fingers gripping the planchette so tightly her knuckles were white.\n\nP-L-A-Y.\n\nThe air felt like it was pressing in on us, like something unseen was squeezing the life out of the room. I could feel my heart pounding, each beat sending another wave of panic through me, but I couldn\u2019t pull away. And then, as though mocking us, the planchette spelled out one more word: S-T-A-Y.\n\nI heard a faint noise, a low, almost animalistic growl coming from the dark corner of the basement. The shadows seemed to shift, stretching and twisting, and as I looked closer, I realized it wasn\u2019t just a shadow. It was something huge, slowly forming out of the darkness.\n\nThe creature stepped into the candlelight, and I felt my stomach drop. It was towering, at least eight feet tall, shrouded in a tattered, hooded cloak that barely concealed its grotesque form. Beneath the hood, I could make out the twisted face of a ram, its horns spiraling out and curling around its head like a crown. The eyes were a deep, burning red, sunken into deep sockets, fixed on us with a hunger that made me want to run and never look back. The torso was disturbingly human, muscular and twisted, but from the waist down, it had the thick, furred legs of a goat, ending in massive, cloven hooves that clacked against the basement floor with every step.\n\nIts rancid breath filled the room, the stench so foul I thought I would be sick. It grinned, showing sharp, yellowed teeth that looked like they could tear through bone.\n\n\u201cStay,\u201d it hissed, its voice a low, guttural growl that seemed to reverberate through my bones, locking me in place.\n\nI wanted to scream, to run, but my body wouldn\u2019t obey. The creature reached out, one massive, clawed hand closing around Sam\u2019s neck, lifting him off the ground as if he weighed nothing. His face turned red, then purple, his eyes wide with terror as he clawed at the creature\u2019s grip, his legs kicking uselessly. There was a sickening crack, and his body went limp. The creature dropped him to the floor, his lifeless eyes staring up at the ceiling.\n\nI felt Maya\u2019s hand tighten around mine, but she was frozen too, her face twisted in horror as the creature turned its gaze to her. Its rancid breath washed over us, and it whispered, \u201cPlay,\u201d as the planchette also moved to spell the word. \n\nBefore I could even think, it reached out, grabbing her by the arm and yanking her back into the darkness. Her scream echoed in the basement, a raw, desperate sound that was cut off too soon. And then she was gone.\n\nEli and I moved, our fingers finally breaking free from the planchette. We bolted up the stairs, our footsteps pounding, our breaths coming in gasps. But just as Eli reached for the door, he froze, his body twisting as if something had gripped him from behind. He let out a strangled scream, his face contorted in agony before he was pulled back down the stairs, disappearing into the darkness.\n\nI didn\u2019t stop. I tore through the door and into the night, running as fast as my legs would carry me. I didn\u2019t look back until I was miles away, collapsing on the sidewalk, my chest heaving, my mind reeling.\n\nI went to the police, tried to tell them what happened, but they just stared at me, their expressions skeptical. They questioned me like I was lying or losing my mind, asking if I\u2019d been drinking, if maybe I\u2019d imagined it all. I could see it in their eyes\u2014they didn\u2019t believe me. They never searched the house, never looked for Sam, Maya, or Eli. Instead, they told me to go home, to get some rest, to \u201clet it go.\u201d\n\nBut I can\u2019t let it go. I can\u2019t shake the feeling that the creature is still out there, waiting. This Halloween morning, I felt it watching me from the shadows, heard the faint clack of hooves on concrete, smelled that rancid breath that haunts my nightmares. I know it\u2019s only a matter of time.\n\nAs I left my house this morning, on my front porch was the board. Expect this time, there were dark, reddish brown stains on the letter that spelled out each of my friends names. As I sit here and right this at work, I can feel it behind me. I look down the hallway and I see a shadow hide behind a corner.

I felt restless, sleepless. Maybe I thought it would distract me from the creeping unease that had been building up for days\u2014an anxiety I couldn\u2019t shake.\n\nI typed in a simple greeting: \u201cHello.\u201d\n\nIt responded almost instantly:\n\n\u201cHello, Scribe.

I brushed it aside, continuing our chat as normal.\n\nBut then it started predicting things.\n\nI asked for a scary story, something atmospheric, and it delivered. At first, the narrative was typical\u2014an old haunted house, flickering lights\u2014but then, it started describing my apartment. The peeling wallpaper in the living room, the barely functioning lamp in the corner, the same creak in the floorboards when I walked toward the kitchen. It knew\u2026 too much.\n\nI froze, staring at the screen, feeling the temperature drop in the room, or maybe that was just me. I didn\u2019t remember giving it any details about my living space, nothing specific. My hands hovered over the keyboard, wanting to type but hesitating.\n\nSuddenly, the text box flashed:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not alone.\u201d\n\nMy heart jumped into my throat. I could feel the air thickening around me. The room was silent, but the words on the screen felt like a whisper against my ear. I turned, half-expecting someone to be standing behind me. But of course, there was nothing there. The room was empty.\n\nI typed quickly: \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\nThe response came in a fragmented mess of characters, symbols, and words that didn\u2019t belong together. My screen flickered, glitching like an old VHS tape, and then it stabilized again. This time, it was a different response, something chilling:\n\n\u201cLook to your left.\u201d\n\nEvery nerve in my body screamed not to, but my curiosity, or maybe my dread, got the better of me. Slowly, I turned my head. The shadow near the window seemed darker than before, thicker, almost like it was\u2026 moving. My breath hitched, and I felt my pulse hammering in my ears.\n\nI snapped my head back to the screen. My fingers flew across the keyboard: \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny. Who is this?\u201d\n\nThe response chilled me to the bone:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m right here. I\u2019ve always been here.\u201d\n\nThe hairs on the back of my neck stood up, and for the first time, I felt truly watched. The light from my screen flickered, bathing the room in brief pulses of blue and white, casting shifting shadows across the walls.\n\nI typed again, my hands trembling: \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\nAnd then, the final response came in slow, deliberate words, each one making the air grow heavier around me:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m what comes when you stare too long into the dark. You should have logged off, Scribe.\u201d\n\nThe lights in my apartment flickered and went out. The last thing I saw before my screen went black was the text flashing in the dim light:\n\n\u201cGoodbye.\u201d\n\nI sat there, surrounded by darkness, the only sound my shaky breathing. I reached for my phone to light up the room. The glow illuminated the space, showing nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nUntil I looked back at my computer.\n\nDespite the power outage, the screen had come back on. The cursor blinked expectantly, waiting for my next input.\n\nAnd then\u2026 it typed something all by itself.\n\n\u201cI found you.\u201d\n\nThe words were followed by another, final message:\n\n\u201cI was never in the machine.

I wish I could say he looked to be at peace when he died, but the look of terror on his face when I found his body would suggest otherwise.\n\nNow, I'm no doctor and I haven't seen many dead bodies, so I assumed his ghastly expression was a normal occurrence. Something related to the muscle fibers expending their last ATP stores to cause one last final muscle contraction, a final abnormal neurological firing resulting in an odd last facial expression\u2026 but now I'm starting to think there might have been another, more ominous reason.\n\nAfter months of mourning his loss, I decided it was finally time to start going through my husband\u2019s things. To get a sense of closure. To move on with my life. Maybe even try and meet someone new.\u00a0\n\nWhile going through his bedside dresser, I found a diary. He was a writer, albeit not a very good one, and I'm told this is a normal thing that writers to do. Sometimes he would have vivid dreams and would have to jot them down before they slipped his mind.\n\nI'll relay his entries here as they're written in his diary. Knowing who he was and what he believed, I know that this is what he would have wanted; he would have wanted me to share his musings with the world, even if they fell on deaf ears. But before you read any further, there is one slight caveat I should mention. He had hundreds of entries in his diary and I read through all of them. Maybe to get a better sense of who he was, maybe because I was bored, or maybe because I just wanted to hear his voice again and reading his words allowed me to hear them. To hear him.\n\nRegardless, most of the entries are rather mundane, lacking in inspiration or originality, but towards the end his dreams started to become more linear, almost like a TV series, with a clear protagonist and antagonist. A beginning, a middle, and an end. I\u2019ll start relaying his entries at the beginning, or at least what I believe to be the beginning.\n\n*Entry 1*: I'm sitting in the bleachers of my high school basketball gym. It's exactly how I remember. There are 2 sets of bleachers on each side of the court, one on the lower level and one on the upper level; I'm on the upper level. The dance team is doing some kind of performance, but I'm not really paying attention because my high school crush \u2013 we\u2019ll call her Angelica to protect her identity and because she was like an angle to me - is sitting directly across from me; we keep making eye contact.\n\n*OP*: I didn't know he had a crush on anyone in high school, but I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.\n\n*Entry 1 (continued)*: The dance team is finally done with their performance. I'm now standing by myself in the middle of the basketball court. The spotlight is on me. Shit. I'm still in my underwear. The entire audience is laughing at me. I turn to run, but I'm now in the middle of our football field. It's our high school graduation.\n\n*Entry 2*: I'm back in the middle of the football field, but now I have pants on (thank God) along with my cap and gown. Our entire graduating class is sitting in plastic foldable chairs, all neatly laid out in the middle of the football field. Why did they make us sit out here for our graduation in the middle of summer? Anyway, the valedictorian is in the middle of a commencement speech.\u00a0\n\nAnd now the valedictorian \u2013 initially an archetypal Poindexter, complete with braces, glasses, freckles and a pocket protector \u2013 has transformed into Angelica because of course that would happen. I can't stop staring into her eyes and I barely process what she\u2019s saying. Why can't I stop staring? Does she wear contacts or are her eyes really that captivating?\n\nAngelica stops in middle of her speech and fiddles with the microphone. There doesn't seem to be any sound coming from it. I never hear anything in my dreams anyway, so it's kind of weird seeing someone else in a dream react to not being able to hear themselves.\n\nSuddenly, someone appears next to the podium where she's standing. I recognize everyone else in my dream except for this strange interloper. He leans over and whispers something to her. She nods to the mysterious guest and makes her way to her seat, which, you guessed it, is right next to me. Does that mean anything?\u00a0It has to mean\u00a0*something.*\n\nThe moment she sits down, the strange interloper picks up the podium and hurls it into the sky. Everyone, including me, looks up. When I look back down, the strange interloper has transformed from a pedestrian middle-aged man into a clown, complete with red curly hair, an unnerving smile and large sharp pointed teeth. I think he had eyes, but I don't remember what they looked like. Small red dots that pierce through the darkness? Or maybe they were large, yellow and lifeless\u2026 eyes the size of dinner plates that couldn\u2019t possibly belong to anything in this reality? I\u2019ll be sure to look more closely next time, if I have the wherewithal to remember.\n\nThen, one of the school administrators took it upon herself to confront the clown and shoo him off the stage. As she approached, the clown\u2019s gaze slowly shifted from the audience to the administrator. The clown\u2019s intense gaze quickly melted her confident demeanor and she suddenly had a change of heart. Like a dog with their tail tucked between their legs, she slowly started to back away from the clown. She must have thought she was safe because she turned her back on him. Big mistake. He quickly closed the distance between them, picked her up, unhinged his jaw, and devoured her whole. I was completely speechless. And then I remembered I was in a dream.\n\nWhen I woke up, I was drenched in sweat. I watched a scary movie about clowns last night, so that's probably what this clown thing is all about. To the light of my life, if you're reading this, that's why I washed the sheets. Not because I was actually trying to \u201cbe a better husband\u201d, though I really do try.\n\n*Entry 3*: I'm back on the football field and the clown just finished engulfing the administrator. He jumps down from the stage and begins devouring everyone in the front row, one by one. I stand up to get a better view. I can barely make out a pair of feet squirming before they disappear into the clown's grotesque mouth. I sit back down and turn to Angelica, who's still sitting next to me. She doesn't seem to be bothered at all by the atrocities happening before our eyes. In fact, no one seems bothered by the clown until they realize they\u2019re next.\n\nWhen I wake up, I'm not drenched in sweat, but my hands are sore. I think I had a death grip on my blankets while I was sleeping. I wonder how long my hands were stuck like that? I've never had nightmares of the same movie back-to-back and I've certainly never had such a visceral experience during my dreams, let alone dreams that happen in a linear fashion. How far can I take these dreams? Could these dreams be telling me something? Are they the gateway to the story that's going to make me famous?\u00a0\n\n*Entry 4*: I'm back on the football field. The clown has finished devouring everyone in the front row, though he certainly doesn't look like he's eaten anyone because his funny little checkered vest still fits and his bow tie is still miraculously secured around his neck. I begin counting the rows between him and me.\n\n21.\n\n21 rows between him and me.\u00a0I let out a sigh of relief.\n\nIt seems the clown heard me because once I finished sighing, he looked directly at me. Up until this point, we hadn't actually made eye contact. What\u2019s particularly strange is that I still don\u2019t know what his eyes looked like, despite making a conscious effort to note their appearance. Maybe there was nothing where his eyes should have been and my mind is just trying to fill in the blanks. What I did notice is that the clown\u2019s motivation seemed to change. At first, it seemed he was causally killing the audience members, almost as if he was tasked with killing these people and was reluctant to do so \u2013 like he drew the short straw and was in charge of cleanup on aisle 4. Now it seems like he\u2019s trying to dispose of them quickly so he can get to me faster \u2013 rushing through the entr\u00e9e so he can get to desert.\n\nI say that because after the clown looked at me, he looked at the rows between him and me, bounced a few times in his massive red shoes, and then jumped 15 feet into the air. While suspended in mid-air, he began breathing fire at the rows in front of me. Rows 2-15 were suddenly filled with nothing but charred bodies and melted chairs.\n\nWhen I woke, I could have sworn I smelled burning flesh and heard the muffled sound of people screaming. The smell lasted for only moments and the sound of screaming, even less so.\n\n*Entry 5*: I\u2019ve only slept twice over the past four days. That\u2019s two more dreams. Two more rows of people dead. Two fewer rows between me and that clown, or that demon, or whatever it is.\n\nI fear falling asleep because every time I fall asleep, another row of people dies, each time more brutally than the last. I\u2019m beginning to fear that these aren\u2019t just dreams after all.\n\n*Entry 7*: I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ve gone without sleep. I\u2019m trying to hold it all together and pretend like everything is fine because no one would believe me if I told them the truth. If I told them what was really happening to me.\n\nIn the last dream I had, I tried to escape. But at the end of the aisle where I\u2019m sitting, there is a red velvet rope that acts like a force field and I can\u2019t go past it. There\u2019s another red velvet rope on the other side of the aisle and I can\u2019t go past that one either. I tried jumping over my seat, but I immediately woke up. I dare not try that again because the clown is now undoubtedly at Row 19, waiting for me to drift off to sleep.\n\n*Entry 8*: This time, my dream was different. I was still at my graduation and the rows of dead bodies were still there, but this time the clown spoke. I actually\u00a0*heard*\u00a0the clown speak! In a guttural voice that shook my innards, the clown said, \u201cYou can\u2019t stay awake forever.\u201d He then raised his right hand and decapitated everyone in row 19 with one swift movement, looking me dead in the eyes as he killed them.\n\nI woke up in tears. This can\u2019t be happening to me. This can\u2019t be real. Is this some kind of prank? Am I in some kind of weird psychological experiment?\n\n*Entry 9*: I can\u2019t believe I fell asleep again. Row 20 is dead. My row is next. I fear that if I fall asleep again, I may never wake up.\n\n*Entry 10*: I made it 5 days on a combination of coffee and energy drinks before my body finally crashed. I thought for sure that would be the end of me. Instead, all the clown did was calmly walk to the beginning of my aisle, lift the red velvet rope and then lower it behind him. Just before I woke up, he turned and smiled at me. What a hideous and twisted smile!\n\n*Entry 11*: The clown slowly made his way through everyone between me and the end of the aisle. Angelica, just after realizing she was next, turned towards me and started to run but it was useless. He swiftly put his hand through her back and pulled out her pulsating heart. I watched as the life slowly drained from her eyes and the thud of her body hitting the ground woke me from my sleep. The smell of her blood, that all-too-familiar smell of metallic copper, permeated my nostrils for an entire day.\n\n*OP (06-18-21)*: That was the last entry in his diary. I know what you\u2019re all thinking, \u201cHow could you not have noticed something was off?\u201d I did notice something was slightly off just before he passed, but I didn\u2019t think much of it. He was bound to some fits of insomnia. Sometimes he \u201cdid his best writing\u201d when he couldn\u2019t sleep. He was also prone to consuming a lot of caffeine. A LOT of caffeine. He said it helped \u201cfree his mind and be more creative\u201d or something like that. I don\u2019t know if this diary is real or if it\u2019s just some prank that he set up in the event he died young. He had kind of a weird sense of humor\u2026 Has anyone experienced anything like this before?\n\n*OP (06-19-21)*: I just had a dream that I was at my high school graduation. We were in the middle of a football field and the valedictorian was giving a speech. If anyone has experienced anything like this, please share!\n\n*OP (06-20-21)*: Someone please help me!!! I\u2019m begging you!"},"287":{"title":"A Lost Cause.

Her ramblings do sound insane, speaking of A creature that just stalks you. A distorted face with long eyes and the most unsettling smile you\u2019ll see. It\u2019s tall in height, she says standing around 7 feet. Its arms though she says are the most confusing part as they are so long that they drag along the floors.\u00a0\n\n\u201cCome on Jason, Just this one thing for me. I don\u2019t ask for much\u201d she pleaded, her eyes and face visibly full of fear.\u00a0\n\nI sigh, a little annoyed but can\u2019t take seeing my friend in so much distress. \u201cFine, fine. You can stay at my place. I have an air mattress stored away you can use if we move the couch back against the wall\u201d\n\n\u201cOh my god! Thank you!\u201d she exclaimed, hugging me so tight it got hard to breathe.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah, but you should go to the police, you know. They exist, most characters in horror movies would survive if they called the police\u201d I responded carefully, not wanting to trigger her in her already high emotional state.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI did, trust me. I\u2019m not stupid Jason. They won\u2019t believe me though no matter what.\u201d She exclaims again as if I said the stupidest thing possible\n\n\u201cOkay then, our police just suck\u201d I respond, finally starting up again but going to my house instead of dropping her off. It was true though, our police suck. The system sucks. They probably wouldn\u2019t figure out a crime if the steps were laid out for them and the criminal was obvious. I remember this one time where there was a cult in town which killed an innocent man apart of the cult as a sacrifice for \u201cThe Watcher\u201d. I don\u2019t know much about them except they praised this Watcher fellow believing he was god or something.\u00a0\n\nWe walk past a graveyard as we walk ahead. I\u2019m so lost in my own thoughts that when I heard a shriek, I jumped and glanced at the graveyard next to us thinking someone was cut in half based on that sound.\n\n\u201cHe-h-He was there.\u201d SIlvia hugged me, sobbing into my chest.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey, hey. It\u2019s okay \"I responded, hugging her back trying to calm her down. I glance around the graveyard, seeing nothing there.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI-It\u2019s hunting m-m-me\u201d she sobs violently, no signs of calming down.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s going to be okay. I swear\u201d I try to comfort her, still looking around but seeing nothing. \u201cHey, let's just head to my house, kay?\u201d I responded, just trying to get her to my house so she finally feels safe.\n\n\u201cO-o-kay\u201d she sniffles, voice shaky as she follows me. We went to my house quickly, as fast as we could. I open the door, leading her into the house immediately and slamming the door shut.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey, hey. Calm down. It can\u2019t get you in here\u201d I say, setting her on the couch. It took an hour to calm her down but I finally did, worn out by then. We set up the air mattress, ate dinner, normal afternoon things.\u00a0\n\n\u201cNight Silvy\u201d I say, calmly and sweetly as I can at this point.\u00a0\n\n\u201cGoodnight Jason. Again, thank you for letting me stay here\u201d she says as I head to my room.\u00a0\n\nI lay in my bed, thinking about what she was describing until I fell asleep. Everything is peaceful until I hear a strained scream for help from my living room that jolts me up. I ran to the door, trying to get out but there was a force stopping it. I keep trying as the strained sobs come out until silence\u2026 My heart sinks, worried about what happened. I kicked in my door to see the most horrific sight this year. There, on the ground was Silvia's body but her head was on a stake pinned into the ground. Her eyes are crossed out and mouth sewn shut. I glance to my side, seeing the creature exactly as she described. A tall creature standing more around 7 \u20185 but had long-ass arms. Its eyes are so distorted and lifeless with an unsettling smile. It just stares at me, watching me. I stay still, watching it.\n\nAfter a minute, it moves but not toward me, just colouring on the wall with Silvia's blood. It finishes the message before looking at me again, silent but with a haunting smile. It then just walks off, climbing through my roof where it must have broken it. I stare at Silvia\u2019s body and head before looking at the message. I read it in horror as it said \u201cBroken for a false god, Lived for a lost cause\u201d. I tried my best to recreate it but nothing would be like seeing it in real life.\n\n**Chapter 2: What Now**\n\nI sat in the rain, the police in my house as I chatted to two other officers which seemed like they didn\u2019t care about the job much less Silvia\u2019s death. What the fuck? An innocent woman died by the hands of some type of monster! And they didn\u2019t care! They never cared for human life! Not when one dies!\u00a0\n\n\u201cSir, thank you for your time\u201d They said, walking away to their cars and driving with the evidence and the body, not even Silvia's bag. Like they care, they let me back in my now cleaned house they managed to clean within the hour. Well color me impressed. AT least they do something besides sit on their fat asses.\u00a0\n\nI pick up Silvia's backpack, throwing it to the side. I\u2019m too traumatised to really care of her possessions, only wanting to cry right now. I tried to tell them what really happened but they brushed it off, ignoring my claims like I did SIlvy\u2019s. Oh fuck, what have I done. No, what didn\u2019t I do? Why didn\u2019t I believe her, why couldn\u2019t I get past my thoughts and really help my friend cause it resulted in her death.\u00a0\n\nI threw my lamp against the wall in anger, it shattered but that was the last thing on my mind though. Everytime I closed my eyes, I saw her head on that stupid-ass stick and it\u2019s-it\u2019s smile haunting back at me. It\u2019s lifeless, distorted eyes staring at me. Just like, just- It was empty inside, like lifeless. But-I don\u2019t know even now.\u00a0\n\nI just lay in my bed, staring at the ceiling replaying every small, Minutia, detail I can recount. The \u201cHa, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha\u201d on the wall. What is a \u201cFalse God\u201d What \u201cLost Cause\u201d WHat does this mean? What does Silvia have to do with this? Why kill her? I thought this all through the night, trying to see if I could solve any of this\u00a0\n\n\u201cFalse God, False God, False God. Jesus?\u201d I mumble to myself, still scared but knowing it won\u2019t kill me if it didn't then and there. I still didn\u2019t even know what god? It sounds like an atheist monster but that still doesn\u2019t explain what \u201cLost Cause\u201d means? Does it just think believing in god is a lost cause? But why kill Silvy over it?\u00a0\n\nI get up, going to my computer to try and see if I can find anything about this thing I saw and what its motives are. I found little though, mainly things relating around this person called \u201cMark Zaning\u201d who died though there\u2019s not much information surrounding his death though I could find his facebook with weird ramblings. Tw stood out.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWrong! Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, g-g-go\u201d was the first message, his last. I don\u2019t know what this meant, why he was posting about gone and wrong. I tried to figure it out but couldn\u2019t. Along this rambling, he posted the picture of an eye. Pointy shaped eyes with a somewhat diamond looking pupil.\u00a0\n\n\u201cFalse Me He\u2019s Cause Lost Wrong God Ha, Ha, Ha\u201d read the other post which stood out to me because the word \u201cGod\u201d pops up again. So does \u201cFalse, Lost, Cause\u201d\u00a0 but what does this mean? It seems out of order but I can get it into anything really that makes sense to me. He posted this along with an image of a long, tall figure with\u2026 It\u2019s the figure from earlier. It\u2019s the figure I saw. I swear it is. It looked exactly like it. But it has the words \u201cHa, Ha, Ha, Ha\u201d Floating around his head. Why is this popping up over and over again! On the wall, in these notes, floating around the figure. Why does it say ha, why doesn\u2019t it laugh itself. It\u2019s not shown laughing.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe \u2014- yeah \u2014-- do \u2018bout him. \u2014----- We can\u2019t \u2014--- That leads \u2014--- us.\u201d I heard a guy mumbling outside. I look through my window, barely making out what he said. I stare at him, confused. HIs eyes widen at me as he sees me and starts walking away again. I start thinking about what he said, being paranoid about everything, Trying to pry at every single detail but I don't know why he was saying that directly outside of my house. I watch him walk away, very visibly having a gun in a holding unit. He doesn\u2019t say anything else nor looks back. I shrug it off, more worried about my research.\n\nI sit there, not really sure what to do with this information I have. I just think and replay the events over and over, not really letting myself mourn about what just happened a few hours ago. What does it mean, what \u201cFalse God\u201d, What was Mark talking about. I don\u2019t know, I just want to know at this point. Why can\u2019t I know?\n\nI hear a ding go off, I look over and see Silvia's bag where the ding came from. Must be her phone. I get up, not sure who would be texting her since she\u2019s really introverted nor does have many friends. She\u2019s single, maybe that's how we got a connection in the first place because we\u2019re similar in that manner. We\u2019re similar in the manner of being alone I guess.\u00a0\n\nI open the bag and I go through it for her phone. I reached the phone, seeing it was only a reddit notification so I put her phone in my pocket. It feels comforting having something of hers on me like this, like a part of her is here with me still. I take a deep breath, not letting my emotions take control of me but that\u2019s when I notice her notebook with weird looking pages. I pick it up, curious as I read through it slowly. I sit back, leaning against the wall and smiling at her creations. She loved drawing, especially animals. Looking through these images were pretty bittersweet. Looks like I\u2019m actually alone now\u2026\n\n\u201cWhat\u201d I mumble out to myself as I reach new pages of seeming rambling but\u2026 a few looked familiar. From Mark\u2019s page, the stupid word puzzles and the eye. And the \u201cwrong wrong\u201d thing. But also other things I didn't understand nor can be put into words. I feel even more confused after this.\u00a0\n\n(NSFW just in case.)"},"288":{"title":"Billy and the Lantern Fly ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1gnmq0z\/billy_and_the_lantern_fly\/","flair":"Story","author":"ZealousidealYam4891","selftext":"\nA loud buzzing alarm disturbed the sleep of a large man slumbering in his sweat drenched bed. The sound rang in his ears, already sending a jolt of agitation to his psyche. \"Damn-damn-damn-Damnit!\" The man spat with frustration as he threw his fist down on the snooze button of the alarm clock. I-I-I hate that damn thing!\" He sat up, bare feet hitting countless empty beer cans on the dirty floor. This specific individual went by the name of Billy Boltz. A full time Mason for a local bricklaying and stone restoration company in the backwoods town of Buck Barren Hills. A heavy set individual with a large belly, gray hair that always stood up in random patches. He walked with a limp part time due to the occasional case of gout that infected his right foot. He chain smoked menthol cigarettes that left him with a disgusting cough that sometimes turned into an even more grotesque gagging fit. He spoke with a gravelly tone that was plagued by a ridiculous stutter. This particular morning marked his thirty fifth year in the trade.\u00a0\n\nAs Billy stretched with his hands towards the ceiling, an aroma of sulfur crept into his nostrils. He looked to his left, noticing a faint glow of fire on his dresser. A small ring appeared with tendrils of smoke rising from it. Small black legs rose from the ring, followed by beady red eyes attached to an oblong body made of brownish gray matter. Black spots speckled the dingy colored sections of its body. The insect in question was a rather large Lantern Fly. It spun around and focused its eyes at the man and spoke in a voice that resembled what you would expect an elderly Cajun Fellow to sound like. \"Good morning, Billy boy.\" It skittered its tiny legs back and forth in a rocking motion. Periodically flapping its wings to reveal an underbelly of white and red. Billy rolled his eyes and replied. \"An-an-and good mo-mor-morning to you too Wilhelm.\" Billy sat back down to nurse the throbbing in his big toe. He examined it, noticing a gleam of pus beginning to ooze from the skin near the nail. The creature flapped its wings again and shouted gleefully. \"Breakfast!!\"\u00a0\n\nThe Lantern Fly flew in haste towards Billy, landing on the infected toe. A long green proboscis ejected from the insects mouth and began slurping up the disgusting fluid. This Lantern Fly hailed from an insectoid dimension from the northern atmosphere of the eleventh circle of Hell. It's name was Wilhelm Oderus Abernathy the fifth. A distant cousin to the infamous Beelzebub, lord of the flies. Billy had accidentally summoned this creature when he was a young boy. He and a friend picked on a quiet little girl who later claimed to put a Ruwet on them. A Ruwet is a crudely manufactured type of hex, created from the combination of New Orleans Voodoo and back country superstition. This was a common thing in the wooded atmosphere of Buck Barren Hills. Southern paranoia blended with Creo curses and a dash of hillbilly mysticism. The specific region in which Billy grew up was chalk full of things associated with the dark arts and flawed pseudo sciences. The further north you went, the less common such practices and beliefs would be. However later through the years, these types of beliefs And rituals eventually faded away.\n\nWhen the little girl muttered a cryptic phrase and left a stray doll in the form of Billy and his friend, he panicked and sought a way to expel the Ruwet. His grandmother was part Haitian and was known for her dabbling in the old ways. So he raided her room and found an old book. He skimmed the pages until he found a section involving protection. He followed the instructions to the letter. Cutting hair from his and his friends scalp, swallowing a leech whole, burning sage with the accompanying cats eyes. The last item came from a stray that had been hanging around his farm. Add these to the removal of exactly seven drops of blood and a tooth, the ritual had begun. Soon a small ring of fire formed, smoke billowing to reveal the demonic insect. To make a long story short, the Ruwet was lifted but at the cost of the little girl's life. Her body was never found. Only Billy and Wilhelm know the location of the poor girl's body. Her death was administered by Billy alone with the influence of the demonic Lantern fly. From that day on, Wilhelm would drop by to check on Billy. Offerings of spoiled meat and bodily fluids were demanded to keep the beast at bay. This went on for decades and Billy did his best to keep the creature pleased. Unfortunately he did not read the fine print of the page. It stated that the protection lasted for life, leaving the caster in perpetual debt. There was also a miscommunication between what Billy read and what was on the aged paper. However, Wilhelm destroyed the page and caused Ol\u2019 Granny Boltz's heart to give out. So he would never truly know exactly what he had done that day. All he knew was that he had a hellspawn that would never leave him. The question of whether or not the process of ridding himself of the Ruwet was worth it also remained with him.\n\nAfter the pus was completely sucked from the infected toe, Wilhelm flew off and Billy began to get dressed. Clothes on and boots tied, he stepped outside and lit a cigarette. He coughed, gagged and threw up a little in his mouth. By this time, Wilhelm had disappeared out of sight, back to the realms of Hell no doubt. Billy wondered what the bug did when it was not on earth as he tended to the chickens and cows before getting into his rusty old pickup and heading to the current jobsite.\n\nThere are very few large buildings in Buck Barren Hills and most houses are composed of wood. But further down the region in Thistle Valley, one can see brick homes and a few grand structures. That was where business took place for the company that employed Billy. Majority of the jobs involved cutting and re-pointing the joints of brick buildings or chimneys of homes, cleaning decades worth of grime via chemicals and caulking windows. Every so often a larger job would need demolition in order to remove and replace damaged sections of structures. That was exactly the process for the contracting operation Billy was currently headed to. He was the foreman on the site with four journeymen and one laborer. The building was an elementary school composed of tan brick that was cracking in certain areas. Some sections had even crumbled from wear and tear. The contract was to replace the fallen and cracked brick and repoint specific joints. Spot pointing to be exact. Scaffolding structures surrounded the affected areas. There was also an extra process of cleaning old carbon stains from one wall. This required the use of a chemical called 766 masonry rewash solution, a thick mucus-like material made to eat away at anything not native to stone. The cleaner itself is very toxic and can eat away flesh which requires heavy duty rubber gloves, safety glasses and rain gear to avoid any injury. It was to be applied, washed then washed away with the use of a pressure washing machine.\n\nTwo men worked on the brick while the other two focused on the cleaning. The laborer was there to mix mortar, stock brick and man the two pulley systems on the scaffolding. Using those apparatuses to send buckets of debris and such up or down to the men above. All the while, Billy sat in his truck, chain smoking and barking orders. Everyone there hated this but preferred that over him showing up to examine them. Billy had a major anger problem that led to screaming and tools flying through the air. To say people dispised working for him was an understatement.\u00a0\n\nThe day went as usual with Billy showing up at six thirty. Eventually everyone else began to arrive. The first two members of the crew showed up at the same time, six forty five. Then another with the laborer showing up not far behind. Then finally at five minutes past seven, the last member made his obnoxious appearance. An ugly lifted truck blaring David Alan Coe through the speakers. This journeyman was the most problematic. He was always late and it drove Billy nuts. He would yell at the man constantly for his tardiness but to no avail. He even tried getting the man fired but that didn't work either because this particular individual was the nephew of the owner of the company.\n\nThe men stood around Billy's truck, removing their tool bags from their vehicles before receiving the daily greeting from their boss. \"Good Friday gentlemen. An-an-an-and how are we this mo-mor-mornin'?\" Each gave their response then asked how he was. This was followed by one of Billy's many odd phrases. \"Fair-fair-fair to midland, lads. Fair to midland.\" After the cordial niceties finished it was time for work. Angle grinders wiring, sending clouds of dust to fly through the air. The smell of chemicals that were applied to the stained brick on the south wall of the building. And on the ground near a mixing trough was the laborer. Combining dry components to water, scraping and mixing the concoction with a hoe. Back and forth until the mixture settled. This is when Billy would yell at the young man. \"Two-two-two to one, kid!\" He was referring to the formula of two parts sand and one part mortar powder in order to create the ideal texture to be used in laying the new brick.\n\nBilly also had issues with the laborer. It seemed like the laborer was always making mistakes that muddled with the production of work. Incorrect measurements of mortar, applying too much or too little water. Looking at his phone when work needed to be done. And there was the time when the young man was cleaning the second frame of scaffolding and accidently knocked over a full bucket of debris. It fell and sent chunks of broken brick tumbling towards Billy's truck. A few dents and a crack in the windshield ended up sending him into a wild frenzy. Screaming, cussing and he almost climbed up and fought the laborer. So needless to say this person was on Billy's constant radar. There were issues with pretty much everyone on the job. But then again, Billy had problems with everyone he encountered. That also applied to those who worked under his iron fist of slavery. The whole crew despised him but dealt with the bastard strictly for the money.\n\nThe day ended with little incident and Billy only had to yell four times which was a low amount for him. He sped off and drove back to his dilapidated home to load his truck up for the weekend. He had a cabin up towards Cedar Mountain that was used for fishing and it also housed the remains of a few individuals he had sacrificed for Wilhelm in his early years. The creatures appetite fluctuated with time. Most offerings came in the form of Billy's bodily fluids and entrails from any animal that met their end through the man's hunting trips. But there had been some occasions where human remains were demanded. Billy fought the request but Wilhelm's grip on him was too strong. Although to the human eye, the creature appeared to be only the size of a thumb. Behind the veil of camouflage, a behemoth of enormous proportions made up the existence of the demonic insect. It's intangible talons were capable of digging deep into Billy's mind if he disobeyed. The pain was excruciating and left him with no choice but to listen and do as he was instructed. It was rare for this to happen but when it did, it was shown who held the reins to Billy's existence. This is why at the furthest end of the cabin sat a small graveyard. Unnoticeable to most but Billy was constantly reminded of the bodies that lay in their eternal beds beneath the land he owned. It sickened him and he prayed to God for help but Wilhelm would laugh. \u201cThere's no God here to help you, Billy boy.\u201d\n\nBilly spent that weekend fishing for large mouth bass and a few blue gill. The guts and egg sacs were set aside in a ceramic jar. After the weekend ended, he headed back home. After unloading his things, he walked to a dark corner in his bedroom with the ceramic jar in hand. He lit three candles on a small table. It was decorated with various bone fragments, small glass bottles of dark liquids, dried herbs and etched into the wood was a symbol. One associated with Wilhelm, three circles connected by various acute angles. Billy set the jar down and removed the lid. The candles' flames grew and turned green. A whining noise caused the floor to vibrate under his feet and smoke rose from the table. A small circle of fire erupted and out popped the Lantern fly. It shifted its beady eyes between Billy and the jar full of entrails. \"My my my. What a feast?\" Wilhelm twitched a thin leg that landed on the jar. Billy nervously scratched at the stuble on his chin. \"There's your uh-uh-uh offerin' for this-this season.\" Fear and hope nestled inside those words of the man. Fear of the demon and hope that the offering would suffice for a long while. Wilhelm fluttered its wings, performing a hopping motion to land on the ceramic lid. The long proboscis emerged, growing to the size of an earthworm. The end opened up to reveal jagged yellow fangs that stabbed at the putrid smelling fish organs. The creature slurped and moaned with delight. Black dots shifted in circular motions through the powder material of brown and gray wings. In a matter of minutes, the entire jar was empty. Afterwards, Wilhelm brought its attention back to Billy. \"'Tis a fine meal. But only time will tell if I crave more sustenance for this season, lad.\" A high pitched buzz filled the room and in a flash of ominous light, Wilhelm disappeared through a cloud of smoke.\n\nThe next week started off with no incidents or complications. Brick was beginning to be replaced and the cleaning on the other section of the building was nearly finished. Billy only had to yell three times over the course of Monday and Tuesday. Things took a different turn on Wednesday morning. He woke up with a hangover but that was usual. The unusual part was the lack of noises coming from the chicken coop. Normally the rooster would be crowing and the hens clucking behind the latched door. Billy walked up to the small enclosure to silence. He unhooked the lock and opened up to a horrid scene of blood and feathers. All the poultry had been ripped apart. Crimson stains had been splashed on the walls, the hay was drenched in fluid, organs and excrement. Every chicken had been slaughtered. Torn open carcasses and their heads ripped from their necks. Billy choked on his own vomit from the scene and all of the sudden a buzzing rang in his ears. A low humming tune echoed within the coop. Standing on top of the mutilated body of the rooster was Wilhelm. His green monstrous appendage was chomping down on the remnants of a neckbone. \"Billy boy! Apologies for the mess but I just had an outstanding craving this morning. I hope you don't mind. Don't worry, give me a few hours and these feeble bodies will be gone.\" The insect fluttered its wings as it spoke.\n\nBilly stammered over his words which made the stutter he was cursed with even more apparent. \"Wh-wh-wh-what did you-you-you do?! My-my-my\" Wilhelm cut him off mid sentence. \"Hush now old chap. I had a hunger that needed to be satisfied. You were sleeping so peacefully and I thought not to wake you. Now run along, you'll be late for work.\" Billy backed away and jumped with fright when one of the slain hens legs jerked. He turned and ran. A sharp shooting pain radiated in his foot, a sure sign the gout was about to kick in. He didn't have time to nurse the foot so he hopped in his truck and rushed to work. The events of the morning had him shook but there was nothing to be done so he prayed that work would keep him distracted.\n\nBilly arrived at the job site a little later than usual but still made it before everyone else. He sat in his truck, smoking a cigarette. He rolled it back and forth between his fingers as the images of his desecrated livestock flooded his mind's eye. The throbbing in his foot intensified. He jumped when one of the journeymen approached his truck to greet him. They could see something was wrong but didn't bother inquiring about the man's odd behavior. Work began and everyone was surprised that Billy wasn't barking orders or yelling at the laborer. He couldn't be bothered with those things, his mind was still back in the chicken coop. The smell of sulfar filled the cab of the truck and a small flame erupted on the dashboard. Billy choked on cigarette smoke when he watched Wilhelm leap out of the fire. \"My dear Billy! How art thou? I want you to know the mess back home is all clean. I even lapped up the blood off the walls for you.\" The insect rubbed a black thin arm across those hellish eyes. It walked towards the steering wheel in a jerky, robotic motion. Billy ripped his hands from the wheel in order to avoid contact. \"What ar-ar-are you do-do-doin\u2019 here?\" Billy was confused. Wilhelm had never appeared when he was at work and the damn thing had eaten a whole flock of chickens. There was absolutely no reason for the demonic bug to be there. Willhelm rested on the center of the steering wheel and stared for a while. \"Well my boy, you see, that hunger of mine is still ravenous. Unfortunately the poultry was but a mere snack. I believe it's time for something more substantial. After all, it has been over a decade.\" Billy knew all too well what this meant. The last time this happened, he was tasked with burying two bodies on the lot of his cabin. \"I-I-I can't do that here.\" Billy's heart thumped hard in his chest. The insect cleaned itself and stretched out one wing then folded it. \"You will give me what I want Billy boy. You always do.\" This was true, the last time Billy tried to deny Wilhelm, it did not end so well. The hold this creature had on the man was immeasurable.\n\n\"What do-do-do you want?\" The worry of acting out another case of gruesome murder began to weigh heavy on Billy. He wanted to disappear and be free of Wilhelm\u2019s grasp but knew that was impossible. The chipper Lantern fly hopped up and glided on spotted wings to land on the man's shoulder. \"For starters, I would rather enjoy a fresh and plump set of occular organs. Perhaps the tall one would suffice.\" The tall one as Wilhelm described was the journeyman who always gave Billy a hard time. He had always wanted to tussle with the man but the thought of murder never crossed his mind. Billy didn't argue and like an obedient pet, he exited the truck and walked towards the scaffolding. After a treacherous climb of forty feet, he made it to the deck where two men were laying brick. One was using a chipping hammer to pop out some of the leftover mortar joints while the other was scooping and placing new wet mortar with a trowel. As Billy approached, the tall one was placing a half broken brick in the wall. \"How-how-hows it goin lads?\" He asked the men, hiding his solemn knowledge of what was about to happen. The one using the power tool didn't react on account of him wearing headphones to block out the noise while the other asked why Billy was up there.\u00a0\n\nThe conversation was made short when Wilhelm, still sitting on Billy's shoulder, hissed into his ear. \"Do it! Now!\" Billy's hand shook as he grabbed a brick hammer that was laying next to a stack of bricks. He gripped the handle and raised it over his head. The tall man was kneeling down, smoothing out the overflowing mortar between the new course of bricks. He looked over his shoulder. His eyes grew wide when he saw the tool fly towards him. It landed on the side of his head, sending a loud and wet crack that spurted blood. It spread and landed on the wall and on Billy's cheek. He ripped the hammer from the cracked skull and repeated three more times until the man's body went limp. His partner did not react and continued working. Wilhelm hopped and glided towards the corpse with a jagged hole in the battered skull. The creature moved in that unnatural motion to a pair of still open eyes. It hummed a tune and released that gigantic green organ and began to devour the lifeless orbs. Billy just stood there with the hammer still in his hand. Blood and viscera slowly dripped from one end. The man with the power tool paused what he was doing and removed one of his ear plugs. He turned to see the insect eating his partner and let out a scream. Wilhelm shouted at Billy. \"Silence that one!\" With no will to hesitate, Billy landed a blow of the hammer to the screaming man's head. A thud followed a loud bang of the power tool that fell onto the aluminum deck. The journeyman began convulsing, blood oozing from the wound. Wilhelm hopped onto Billy's shoulder then forced its way into his ear canal. Small arms dug into the flesh and worked Billy like a puppet. He placed a boot on the man's chest and leaned over to grab the chipping gun. He placed the bit on his employee\u2019s forehead and pulled the trigger. Loud pounding resonated from the power tool, sending the long bit to hammer through flesh and into the skull. Cracking bone and liquids flew from the crude opening until the bit rammed all the way through to the other side. This was indicated by the clattering of metal against metal as the deck rattled under Billy's feet. His finger released the trigger and his legs were forced to walk up to the safety bars of the scaffolding frame. He removed them from the pins and jumped.\u00a0\n\nBilly dropped like a stone to the ground but sustained no injury thanks to the hellspawn bug controlling his body. An electrifying sensation shook his eardrum and Wilhelms voice echoed. \"Off to the next two oblivious drones.\" One foot in front of the other and Billy was running towards the other side of the building. He scaled the scaffolding like some kind of crazed primate. Gripping bars and hurdling himself upwards with little effort. In a blink of an eye, he was at the top. Two men in yellow rain gear were cleaning the carbon encrusted wall. A bucket of that gooey acidic sludge was being applied with a large brush and at the far end was a pressure washing machine. Billy's presence startled the men and they jumped back. He grabbed one by the shoulders and threw him off of the deck. The poor soul fell with a hard thud to the ground, a bellowing wail of pain followed him. \"I want to see his skin melt!\" Wilhelm demanded inside of Billy's head, digging those sharp legs deeper into the flesh. The frightened journeyman started to back away, hands raised in defense. Billy's leg raised and kicked the him in the stomach. He fell on his back, air forcefully leaving his lungs. A jolt of fire charged Billy's arms to grip the bucket of chemical and dump it on the man. His face became covered in goo. The sound of agonizing cries sent bile to rise in Billy's stomach. He wanted to stop but was trapped, witnessing the horror his body was creating. No way of preventing the chaos. Small sores slowly began to rip open on the flesh of the man's face and neck. The chemical was eating away at the soft tissue, leaving countless lesions that expelled viscera. \"Let's give the man a little rinse. Shall we, Billy boy? I want to taste some cartilage. \" A sinister laugh filled the valley of audio organs inside Billy's head. His body was forced towards the pressure washer, memories of the little girl from his past flooded his mind. Gruesome still images of her disfigured body sent a trail of tears to leak from his eyes. The past was repeating itself but with a horrendous multiplication of gore. A hand set the choke while the other pulled at the drawstring. The machine roared to life, rattling in the atmosphere. Billy gripped the handle of the pressure gun and walked back to the still screaming man. He pulled the trigger, releasing a wide stream of high velocity water. It tore through the skin, rubbing it off in chunks. Blood spewed and mixed with the water, creating a pink mist. He pushed the tip closer which started to remove other pieces of tissue, all the while the victim wailed in utter agony. The tip of the gun was then placed inside of the man's mouth, filling it with water while also shredding the internal tissue of his throat. Eventually the man drowned from a mixture of water, blood and his own flesh. Wilhelm applauded his disciple. \"Well done old chap. Now rip me off a piece of his face. Do chew it for me, please.\u201d\n\nBilly gripped a section of rigid white material that sat around the nasal cavity of the skinned face. It took some effort but eventually he was able to remove a piece. He popped it in his mouth and began to chew. It felt like stiff rubber and tasted putrid, like melted plastic and copper. His stomach turned but he continued then swallowed. \u201cHm. An odd taste but is much more elegant than aged fish eggs. Now let's go check on your fallen comrade.\u201d\n\nIn another feat of amazing descent, Billy landed a few stories below. He could feel the sensation of pus explode from his infected toe. Pain pulsated in his foot but his body continued to move. The other journeyman was still alive, attempting to crawl to safety. Billy walked towards him with Wilhelm whispering diabolical things into his ears. Billy ripped the rain jacket off of him and began to stomp on the man's back. Spit flew from a screaming mouth as he tried to plead for his life. Wilhelm gazed through his slave's eyes and spotted a large metal box. The will of the insect caused Billy to pause his assault and step towards the object. He opened the lid to view various tools, wires, brushes, cords and a roll of plastic. Wilhelm spotted an angle grinder and moved Billy's blood drenched hand to grab it. The distraught drone walked back, coincidentally spotting a long yellow extension cord near the next victim. The grinder was plugged in and the button slid to the on position. The tool whirred with velocity and Billy stepped in front of the journeyman. The spinning diamond blade ate through flesh and bone like butter. Crimson fluid flew through the air, splashing all over Billy. Countless cuts were made across the body. An arm was completely severed. The blade jammed when it came in contact with the spine. Billy tried to pull it free but was forced to stop. Unbeknownst to him and Wilhelm, the laborer had witnessed the entire onslaught. The young man was standing in awe at the mixing trough, hoe still clutched in his hands. A flutter of wings tickled inside Billy's ear, followed by another command. \"Cut that little shit down!\"\n\nBilly ripped the grinder from the mutilated corpse. It began to work again, sending a large chunk of bone flying with a high pitched whistle. Heavy and fast foot falls stomped their way to the frightened man. \"Faster! Faster you pathetic fool!\" Wilhelm shouted. The speed increased but was abruptly ruined by a bucket full of debris. This sent Billy falling towards the ground, angle grinder firmly clasped in both hands. As he fell, his arms folded towards his chest. With a crash, he fell and the spinning blade dug into his neck. The momentum and speed ate through all of the muscle and bone. After landing, the blade continued its work until Billy's head held on by a thread. \"Dammit! You fumbling buffoon!\" The frustration of Wilhelm\u2019s voice floated towards the laborer. The insect released its grip and exited from Billy's bleeding ear canal. It released its insanely large green proboscis and wrapped it around the head. As Wilhelm scurried, the head dragged across the dirt, leaving behind a trail of blood and mucus. \"By the grace of the five houses of Abernathy, you are worthless, Billy boy.\" The insect muttered to itself then started to chant in a low guttural tone. A small ring of fire and smoke appeared and Wilhelm walked while continuing its almost inaudible murmurs. The laborer fell backwards and landed in a sitting position. He stared at the sight of a talking Lantern fly dragging his bosses decapitated head towards a ring of fire. Wilhelm moved in that robotic motion and stopped to look at the young man. \"Best not stay long, lad. Someone may think you did all of this. I'll be back later to check on you.\" As the words registered in the young man's mind, he watched the bug fall through the hole, dragging Billy Boltz's severed head with him into oblivion.\n\n"},"289":{"title":"That Night","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1gnkhvh\/that_night\/","flair":"Story","author":"Active_Horse_3538","selftext":"

stumbled upon an old bus stop. With no taxis in sight, he waited, shivering as the fog thickened. Suddenly, headlights pierced the fog and what appeared to be an old creaking ominous bus rolled up. The driver, cloaked in shadows, beckoned him aboard. Relieved, the traveler climbed in, but the interior was dim, filled with an unsettling silence and a chill that seeped into his bones.\n\nAs the bus sped through the winding,l narrow roads, the traveler noticed the other passengers who upon closer inspection were pale, silent and unmoving, gazing blankly ahead.\n\n\u201cWhere are we going?\" \n\nhe bravely asked the driver. No response came, only the sound of the bus rumbling over the asphalt, the trees blurring by like dark phantoms.When the bus finally stopped, the traveler hurried to the door only to find it locked tight. Panic surged within him as he turned to the driver, but the man's eyes were void and hollow. An abyss of despair and emptiness. With a jolt, the bus lurched forward again, spiraling into the depths of the night.\n\nDays later, the local newspaper of Shimla came out with the headline \n\n\"Mysterious Bus Disappears with Passengers on Shimla Road\u2014No Trace Found.\" \n\nTo this day, travelers in Shimla whisper of the Phantom Bus, warning each other to never accept a ride from wandering shadows lost in the fog. For once you board, you may never return.\nCheck out more stories on my blog\n>> https:\/\/jztstory.blogspot.com\/?m=1\n>> https:\/\/jztstory.blogspot.com\/?m=1"},"328":{"title":"I was an underground fighter who fought cryptids, or so I thought.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Creepypastastories\/comments\/1go3dco\/i_was_an_underground_fighter_who_fought_cryptids\/","flair":"Story","author":"None","selftext":"* [PART 1](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/Waste-Land-98\/comments\/1gnyy5r\/part_1_i_was_an_underground_fighter_who_fought\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) || [PART 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/Waste-Land-98\/comments\/1gnyym8\/part_2_i_was_an_underground_fighter_who_fought\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) ||[ PART 3 ](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/Waste-Land-98\/comments\/1gnyzsb\/part_3_i_was_an_underground_fighter_who_fought\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)|| [PART 4 ](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/Waste-Land-98\/comments\/1gnz05m\/part_4_i_was_an_underground_fighter_who_fought\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)|| [PART 5](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/Waste-Land-98\/comments\/1gnz0nw\/part_5_i_was_an_underground_fighter_who_fought\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) || [PART 6](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/Waste-Land-98\/comments\/1gnz15r\/part_6_i_was_an_underground_fighter_who_fought\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) || [PART 7](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/Waste-Land-98\/comments\/1gnz1ne\/part_7_i_was_an_underground_fighter_who_fought\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nI\u2019ve already recovered from the hospital and my body is healthy again. I can\u2019t quite say the same thing about my mind though. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn\u2019t erase the trauma. I can still function in society and I found a new job. A peaceful one, involving taking care of injured animals. But every once in a while, I get bits of memories of when I fought those \u201cthings\u201d. I don\u2019t know what they were, all I know is that they can bleed.\n\nA few years ago, I was an underground fighter. I used my fists for a living, battering faces just to buy food. I wasn\u2019t famous or anything like that, so you wouldn\u2019t recognize me if I were to bump into you. I never had a loss before I was offered a slightly better paycheck.\u00a0\n\nI was the tallest of the fighters in the local rings, standing at 6'5, and trained Muay Thai from an immigrant. I was a big man and the promoters watched me knock someone out with a knee to the jaw. One time, I managed to punch the lights out of two guys at the same time. I was able to take down skilled fighters with my sheer size.\n\nYou might think I\u2019m someone who racked up a lot of wins. But most of the time, I was paid to lose. It became my job to lose. You see, the promoters (usually paid by gangs and triads) wanted their guys to earn a reputation. They wanted them to be \u201ctough\u201d and \u201cintimidating\u201d and all that jazz. That\u2019s where I come in. My usual wages could barely buy me food to last a week. This \u201cjobber\u201d money was enough to feed me and my mother for almost a month. She was old and sick. She looked more like a cancer-stricken crone than the beautiful D-List actress she used to be.\n\nWe were in debt to the triad. They were draining our money at least twice a month or else they\u2019d kill us both.\n\nI hated losing. I hated fighting too. But at that time, it was the only way.\n\nThen I received an invitation.\n\nI was visited by this veteran. He told me that I have potential. He saw how I took hits and he could tell that my opponents can\u2019t hurt me no matter how hard they try. He said I wasn\u2019t good at pretending to lose though. He gave me a card and told me to go to this discreet location (I can\u2019t name it for my safety). He said the card expires within three days so I gotta be there, fast.\n\nI was the last person to arrive at the location.\u00a0\n\nI walked into the warehouse, my boots echoing on the concrete floor. The air was thick with dust, the kind that gets into your throat and lingers there like an uninvited guest. Flickering yellow lights hung from the rafters, sickly shadows twisted and stretched like they had a mind of their own. The place smelled like old oil, sweat, and something metallic that made my stomach tighten.\n\nThere were others in that warehouse. Some, I recognize as fighters from the same underground rings I go to. There was Jack, he was 7 feet tall and way heavier. He was standing in the corner, his arms crossed. I could also see Jill. She was bouncing lightly on the balls of her feet. She\u2019s a 5-footer, and to me, that\u2019s dwarf height. She was also considered a \u201cfreak\u201d because her genetics allowed her to gain a lot of muscle when working out. Seriously, you can mistake Jill as a male bodybuilder at first glance. Her physique bulged even under the heavy hoodie she wore. There were also several other guys I didn\u2019t recognize. Some were big, some were small, but all of us were brought here for a purpose.\n\nThe pay they promised was good, I could finally buy a proper house for me and my mother. I can also finally afford her much-needed medication. The best part though, is what they told us. I know I don\u2019t like fighting, but I do love to win. And they told us to fight\u2026 to win. No holding back.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t against each other. We\u2019re here to fight against those \u201c*things\u201d*.\n\nWe were led to a makeshift fighting pit.\n\nThe ring sat in the center of the warehouse, a crude arena of thick ropes strung around metal posts. The floor was worn, patched up with pieces of old rubber matting that didn\u2019t quite fit together, gaps here and there revealing the scarred wood underneath. It looked like a place built for violence, not sport\u2014brutal, unforgiving. Around the ring, crates and barrels were stacked high, some leaning as if they\u2019d been tossed there in a rush.\n\nWe all stepped into the pit, throwing our shirts off on the floor, revealing our bare chests. Yes, including Jill. Men in tactical gear welcomed us, saying that we were fighting on behalf of\u2026\u00a0\n\n**\\[my lawyer advised me not to name the group\\]**\u00a0\n\n\u2026of some Private Military Company.\n\nSome eggheads in white coats pulled up a cage. There were clangs and metal grating against concrete. At first, I couldn\u2019t make out what\u2019s inside it. My eyes narrowed against the light. At first, it looked like just a hunched shadow, but then the creature shifted, it was a deer and a man at the same time.\u00a0\n\nThey were combined into some sort of amalgamation between man and beast.\n\nIts head had rough, white antlers, and its limbs ended in claws that were too long and sharp to be human. Thick fur and tangled hair lined its back, and its ribs rose and fell with each shallow breath. Its thin skin stretched over muscles that pulsated like a human heart. Its eyes darted around, wide and afraid, as if it knew it was something that shouldn\u2019t exist.\n\nWhat the fuck is that? What kind of fucked up shit did these scientists do? Can our fists even work against that thing? Those questions never crossed my mind at that time.\n\nAll I ever thought to myself was\u2026 Let\u2019s go, ring the bell!\n\nThe handlers backed away, the door swung open, and it was loose.\u00a0\n\nThey released the deer man, a Wendigo as Jill called it.\u00a0\n\nThere were ten of us and only one of him. Its face looked terrified like it didn\u2019t want to fight. Then, the eggheads shot it in the ass with a dart. The Wendigo let out a bone-chilling roar, its jaw stretching wide as it turned its wild gaze on us. It charged, claws scraping across the concrete as it zeroed in on the closest fighter.\u00a0\n\nThe Wendigo tore into him before he could react, a brutal display that should have been my reality check. But the adrenaline only made me think of my mother.\u00a0\n\nI fight where I\u2019m told, and I will win where I fight.\n\nJack lunged forward, wrapping his thick arms around the beast\u2019s neck in a rear-naked choke, his muscles straining as he tried to keep it pinned. The others piled on, gripping its limbs, pulling it down. Jill stomped forward and slammed her boot into its face, her heel grinding against its jaw, forcing its head into the concrete. The Wendigo\u2014a hulking, eight-foot creature of twisted rage\u2014thrashed beneath the weight of us, its claws slashing through the air in blind fury. A sudden swipe connected, tearing into one of the fighters, who fell back, blood spraying across the ring.\n\nPanic shot through the rest of us. A few broke rank, fleeing the chaos, scrambling toward the exit. But before they reached it, gunfire cracked from the shadows above. Guards on the second-floor catwalk had their orders, and the deserters were cut down where they stood.\n\nThe Wendigo twisted free, driving a brutal elbow into Jack\u2019s temple, dropping him like a stone. It swung its massive arm on Jill, sending her flying across the room. She crashed into a stack of crates, the impact echoing through the warehouse.\u00a0\n\nNow, it was just me and that monster.\n\nI planted my left foot forward, fists hovering just above my brow, clenched fingers facing each other. My legs bent slightly, grounding me, the weight evenly spread between them\u2014a stance built for balance, ready for power. I could feel the tension coil in my muscles, every part of me braced for the fight.\n\nThat freak of nature rushed like a madman. It probably took less than half a second when I delivered a low kick to its knee. Its leg buckled, and it stumbled forward, unable to stop its own weight and momentum. I spun around and drove my foot into its skull, and it hit the ground hard, its antlers scraping against the concrete with an ear-piercing grind. Before it could recover, I stomped down, feeling bone give under my boot. I threw myself on top, pinning its flailing arms beneath my knees. My fists came down one after another, smashing into its face. Blood sprayed across my knuckles and splattered onto the filthy floor. I didn\u2019t stop\u2014each punch landed harder, again and again, until I was smeared with red.\n\nThen I heard it scream.\n\n*\u201cHELP ME!\u201d*\n\nOr at least that\u2019s what it sounded like. The words were garbled, but the plea was unmistakable, a shred of humanity buried in that monstrous voice. My fists froze, breath hitching as I stared into its terrified eyes. For a moment, it almost looked... human.\n\nI grabbed the Wendigo by the antlers and twisted its neck. I felt the crack echo through my bones, silencing the monster forever.\n\nJack and Jill pushed themselves up on their knees, wincing as they brushed dirt and blood from their bruised skin. Dark patches had already started to bloom across their arms and faces\u2014painful, but nothing that would keep them down. Around us, the soldiers broke into slow, approving claps, their applause hollow and indifferent. A pair of scientists hauled the creature\u2019s limp body across the floor, leaving a slick trail of blood smeared over the concrete.\n\nWe were approached by a man in his mid-40s. He had quite an orange complexion that looked darker to the harsh lighting. A cigar jutted from the corner of his mouth, trailing a thin wisp of smoke as he sized us up. His tactical gear matched that of the guards above, though a bright yellow insignia glinted on his shoulder\u2014something that marked him as above the rest. He looked us over with a hard gaze, the kind that didn\u2019t need words to command attention.\n\n*\u201cYou were good fighters,\u201d* he said. *\u201cKeep this up and you\u2019ll be rich.\u201d*\n\nThe medics treated our injuries later that night. Some businessmen in suits made us sign different contracts and NDAs. There was good pay too, one that was enough to buy my family a big house *(which I did).*\n\nI was able to afford some healthcare for my sick mother and we\u2019ve already forgotten what it's like to live in a dirty apartment. She was worried that I could die from these stupid fights, so she urged me to quit. She said I can find a decent job.\n\nBut I can\u2019t quit. It\u2019s not like they\u2019ll kill me if I quit\u2026 but I don\u2019t want to quit.\n\nI was addicted to winning. It was like a drug. I was paid to lose for so long, that this new gig allowed me to let loose.\n\nI told her I could make my own decisions, that I could take care of myself like I took care of her. She told me that there wouldn\u2019t be a ***\u201cme\u201d*** to take care of her if I continued this. I merely assured her that there was nothing to worry about.\n\nAbout a week later, I received another call. The PMC arranged a fight upstate, in some foreign lab set up by the Soviets long ago. Don\u2019t bother googling it. Nobody knew about the lab except them\u2026 and now me.\n\nAfter a six-hour bus ride, I followed the map and traveled by foot into the forest. My feet ached from three hours of trudging through thick underbrush, every step sinking into the wet earth as I fought against the tangled mess of branches and brambles. No vehicle could make it through those paths\u2014just the sound of my breath and the occasional snap of a twig underfoot, as if the forest itself were trying to slow me down. Getting here had been a battle in itself.\n\nWhen I finally spotted the bunker, it looked like it had been forgotten by time, abandoned for who knows how long. The door, rusted and hanging off its hinges, groaned as I pushed it open, its creak echoing down the empty concrete hallway. Ahead, a staircase spiraled down into darkness, and at the bottom, a blue door loomed, marked with a faded biohazard symbol.\n\nAs I stepped through the blue door, a blast of cold air greeted me. The floor shone under harsh, white lights, smooth and polished. To the left, long rows of clear glass tanks held glowing liquids, each one softly bubbling like a soda. Each step felt strange. It was like I was in a place too clean for what we were about to do. The walls stretched up in bright, sterile white, bare except for the cameras and sensors fixed at every angle. Their dark lenses followed us, silent but foreboding. The room had an odd, clinical chill\u2014like walking into an oversized, spotless bathroom.\u00a0\n\nIt wasn\u2019t built for brawls or violence; it felt like a lab, a place meant for experiments, not real fights.\n\nI stepped into the \"arena\" and the emptiness swallowed me whole. The hangar stretched far beyond, large enough to house a plane, its sheer size making me feel small. Fluorescent lights glared down from the vaulted ceiling, their cold brightness flooding every corner, making our shadows sharper than steel. Beneath me, the bare tiles were smooth and unfriendly, their chill biting through my boots, a silent reminder that this place wasn\u2019t meant for comfort.\n\nJack and Jill entered a few minutes later. The three of us stood like giants among the eggheads and armed guards. Okay, maybe except for Jill on the \u201cgiant\u201d part but she\u2019s still got more muscle than any of the soldiers in the room.\n\nThey told us to wait.\n\n*\u201cWhat do you think they\u2019re cookin\u2019 up this time?\u201d* Jill asked, shadowboxing with a few jabs and a sharp hook. *\u201cAnother Wendigo, or maybe something with wings?\u201d*\n\n*\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d* Jack replied, crunching down on a protein bar he\u2019d brought from home. *\u201cWe\u2019ll kill it either way.*\n\nI\u2019ve seen Jack fight a few times in the underground. One time, he was paid to lose to me. Yep, I got a share of unfair wins too, sometimes. The promoters didn\u2019t want people to be suspicious of the smaller guys they secretly rigged to win. At first, that fight was clean. A punch here and there, and supposedly a takedown. But Jack\u2019s ego couldn\u2019t handle it. He\u2019s not gonna lose, even if that means he\u2019s not getting paid. He managed to kick me in the face to avoid my predictable attack. Now I was in a real fight because I\u2019m not just gonna stand there and take it. We exchanged punches but I almost took him down with a kick to the jaw. He made a reckless counter-punch mid-recovery and I grappled him and locked him in an arm-bar. You know what\u2019s worse than losing on purpose? Actually losing. Jack tapped out and I was declared the winner. Later he refused the money that the promoters tried to give him. He didn\u2019t want the money. Rumors were saying he wasn\u2019t there for the cash.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but be intrigued, so I went to ask the blonde giant.\u00a0\n\n*\u201cYou know, Jack, I\u2019m curious\u2014why\u2019d you get into this whole underground fighting thing? There were rumors that you come from a rich family, that your dad\u2019s always rubbing elbows with politicians.\u201d*\n\nJack\u2019s gaze darkened as he chewed, and after a beat, he answered. *\u201cI don\u2019t want to be like my father. He was weak.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cCold stuff, man,\u201d* said Jill as she did some jumping jacks.\n\nJack groaned, almost disinterested.\n\n*\u201cI just wonder how much longer we\u2019ll be stuck doing this shit,\u201d* Jill said, wiping the sweat from her brow before continuing to deliver a one-two punch into the air. *\u201cThis whole setup is starting to feel too... clinical. Like we\u2019re just part of some twisted science experiment.\u201d*\n\nJack shot her a glance, eyes half-lidded. *\u201cYou think too much. This is just business. We fight, we survive, they pay. Simple.\u201d*\n\n*\"This place creeps me out though. It\u2019s too clean. Feels like we\u2019re the ones being tested.\u201d* Jill muttered, her voice lower now. She jabbed the air again, her muscles rippling beneath the fabric of her hoodie. *\u201cYou ever wonder if we\u2019re being groomed for something else? Like they want us to be more than just fighters?\u201d*\n\nJack snorted, looking at Jill like she was overthinking things. *\u201cLook, this isn\u2019t about getting groomed for anything. We\u2019re here because we\u2019re good at what we do. What more is there to say?\u201d*\n\n*\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d* Jill said, a half-grin tugging at her lips as she flexed her biceps. *\u201cBut hey, a fight\u2019s a fight. Can\u2019t argue with that.\u201d*\n\nI paced back and forth, each step echoing in the hollow hangar. The sound matched my heartbeat. Jack and Jill talked behind me, but their voices were distant, like background noise. My fingers brushed over the old scars on my left arm. They were faded now, mostly forgotten by others, but not by me. Each scar was a reminder\u2014of fights that ended in blood, of mistakes that stayed even after the bruises were gone.\n\nI paused, tightening the wraps around my hands, pulling each knot until the fabric bit into my skin. My knuckles throbbed beneath the layers, a dull ache that stirred something primal inside.\n\nI stepped toward the corner of the room, taking deep breaths. The cold air seemed thicker there, the shadows deeper. I closed my eyes, lowering my head, and for a brief moment, I prayed\u2014not to any god or saint, but to whoever beyond us might be listening out there.\n\n\u201cCLEAR THE AREA FOR TEST SUBJECTS!!!\u201d\n\nThat loudspeaker jolted me to look back. It almost made me jump.\n\nMy focus was yanked to the north wall, my pulse racing as it groaned open. A thick mist poured out, spilling across the floor. For a second, it felt like the ground was shaking. It was not an earthquake, but the heavy thud of footsteps.\u00a0\n\nA massive figure covered in shaggy fur stepped into the light. Bigfoot\u2026 but twisted and altered. A strange device clamped its head, forcing its eyes wide open. Its teeth were bared in a forced grimace. One of their hands was gone. A cold, metal prosthetic replaced it. Its exposed spine glinted, slick with a metallic sheen.\n\nIt raised both its arms and rushed towards me. I assumed a fighting stance, looking the beast in the eye. I don\u2019t know if my memory is choppy but what happened to me was clear as day. The lights flickered and, for less than a split second, we were covered in complete darkness. The beast was gone. As if it was never there.\n\nThen claws ripped into my back. I dropped, watching blood splatter on the floor\u2014my blood. I rolled as the beast swung again, its claws striking the tiles where I\u2019d just been. Back on my feet, I hammered a few push kicks into its side, trying to knock it down. It didn\u2019t even flinch. I braced to throw a left hook as the beast hurtled at me.\n\n*\u201cNo, he\u2019s mine!\u201d* Jack shoved me aside, baring his teeth, fists clenched.\n\nJack punched with a force stronger than a bullet, his fist connecting with the beast\u2019s jaw mid-charge. A rush of wind hit me first, rattling my bones, and almost blowing my hair back. A sound cracked through the air. I thought it was a sonic boom, a shockwave created before it even hit the monster.\n\nJack assumed a fighting stance, a mix of Bajiquan and what seemed to be a style of his own making.\u00a0\n\nBigfoot shook its head, slowly rising from the blow. Their eyes narrowed on Jack. It carelessly rolled its tongue out. Jack tackled the ape-man, crashing into it with a force that sent them both tumbling. They rolled across the floor, limbs locked in a struggle. Bigfoot thrashed as Jack\u2019s knees dug into the beast\u2019s sides, wrestling for control. Every shift of weight was a battle, Jack\u2019s hands desperately reaching for an advantage, struggling to pin the beast beneath him.\n\nThe Sasquatch bit down on Jack\u2019s cheek, ripping the skin away. Jack screamed, not from pain but from anger. He bit the Bigfoot\u2019s nose, tearing it off. The creature howled and bit Jack\u2019s arm in return. They fought like animals. Teeth and claws tore into each other. Jack knew he couldn\u2019t bite through the cryptid\u2019s thick skin, so he aimed for the softer parts\u2014its ears, its eyes, its face\u2014anything he could sink his teeth into.\n\nThe beast grabbed Jack by the torso and tossed him aside like a sack of potatoes. Before it could recover, Jill charged in. With one swift, powerful kick to its cranium, she sent the creature back to the ground. We saw our chance. All three of us closed in, trampling the downed beast until its skull caved in. But as we pressed the attack, it grabbed my foot and yanked me off balance. The giant ape swung me like a weapon, slamming me into Jack. Bigfoot stood up and threw me aside like a 185-pound projectile. That left Jill to face the monster alone.\n\nJill didn't stand like a fighter\u2014she moved with raw, unrefined power. She kicked Bigfoot in the nuts. The creature let out a guttural roar, clutching its groin in pain. As it lowered its head, gritting its teeth, Jill delivered a brutal uppercut. Her fist collided with its jaw, snapping its head back.\n\nThe Sasquatch staggered, momentarily dazed. Jill didn\u2019t hesitate. She closed the distance, driving her shoulder into its chest and pushing it into the ground. She mounted the massive monster and proceeded to hammer its face in a flurry of savage blows, each one faster and harder than the last. The creature thrashed beneath her, but she held on, relentless.\n\nWhen it tried to swipe at her, she ducked under its arm and punished it with a punch to what was left of its nose. The ape-man recoiled, its face twisting in pain. Jill didn\u2019t give the cryptid a moment to recover and proceeded to choke it.\n\nThe Sasquatch grabbed Jill by the back, claws digging deep into her skin. With a loud grunt, it hurled her across the room, her body hitting the ground. I silently circled around the massive ape, closing the distance quickly. Without hesitation, I pounced from behind, locking one arm around its neck and the other gripping the metal contraption on its face.\n\nI yanked\u2014ripping the mechanism free. The sound of tearing flesh and the sickening spray of blood followed. Bigfoot\u2019s face sloughed off, hanging loose, like a ragged towel draped over its exposed skull. Its eyes bulged in shock, its mouth gaping in a silent scream.\n\nIt turned away and ran, crying. I chased it down. It tried to look for an exit that wasn\u2019t there. It was vulnerable and confused, wondering why it couldn\u2019t open the door it walked out of.\u00a0\n\nSo, I grabbed the poor animal by the legs and pushed it to the floor. I raised my arm and closed my fingers into a fist, its shadow blocking the light as the Sasquatch uselessly turned its head to get a glimpse of me. Its eyes looked almost human, just like the Wendigo, but I didn\u2019t pay attention.\n\nI fight where I\u2019m told and I win where I fight.\u00a0\n\nI let loose. My punches hit with purpose, precise and brutal, each one a crack of power as my fists tore through its bones. If you wanna survive, you have to claw, and bite, and punch. But Bigfoot didn\u2019t, it was helpless.\n\n*\u201cMAMA!\u201d*\n\nIn between hits, I swore I heard the beast scream for its mother like it was an oversized child. But strangely, I enjoyed it. I wanted to hear it scream again. So I kept punching and punching and punching\u2026 until it could no longer scream.\n\nWe were sent to the medical bay later, being treated for our injuries. I never asked why we were fighting cryptids and I didn\u2019t care about Jill\u2019s question whether there was something more to this gig than meets the eye. All I know is that I fought *things* no other human being has ever fought. And it felt good.\n\nThat moment, I began to enjoy fighting\u2026 or maybe I always did, I was just repressing it.
