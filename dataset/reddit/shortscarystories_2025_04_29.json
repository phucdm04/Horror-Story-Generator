{"title":"Morotarium Clarification","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortscarystories\/comments\/1jivaz7\/morotarium_clarification\/","flair":null,"author":"SimbaTheSavage8","selftext":"\nGreetings,\n\n\nWith the moratorium on relationship revenge stories having been in effect for over a month now, we\u2019ve seen that it has made a great difference in the types of stories being posted on SSS and are happy with the results so far. However, we\u2019ve gotten feedback from authors that we need to provide a clearer definition of what we\u2019re looking for with regards to what \u201crelationship revenge\u201d is and give examples. \n\nUnfortunately, this is a difficult proposition as we cannot possibly narrow down every possible scenario or subversion of the troupe we are banning. We can only address this as the stories are posted and reviewed. It\u2019s not the best scenario, but it\u2019s probably the best one to serve out purposes right now.\n\n\nHowever, we can try to narrow it a bit so we\u2019re at least on the same page and have something to refer to when we make our decisions.\n\n\nAt its basic definition, a relationship revenge story is a story centered around either family members or people in relationships getting revenge upon another family member\/person in relationship with for doing something to them.\n\n\nFor example, a husband is cheating on his wife. His wife poisons his food. He dies.\n\n\nOr\u2026a twin brother is jealous of his other brother having a sexy spouse. He kills his brother and takes his place with the sexy spouse.\n\n\nOr\u2026a baby hates his father because he doesn\u2019t want to share his mother with his father. The baby creates a time machine and assassinates his father as a child (yes, I\u2019m thinking about Stewie from Family Guy).\n\n\nOr\u2026a Prince killing his brother, the king, to take the throne. And the ghost of the King comes back for vengeance against his evil murderous brother.\n\n\n**All these would not be allowed under the moratorium.**\n\n\nA subversion of the troupe would be to make it best friends, a teacher and a student, a priest and an alter boy, or a pair of baseball players on the same team. While not directly related as family members, they\u2019re a part of a \u201crelationship\u201d and they\u2019re seeking \u201crevenge\u201d against another person who did them wrong.\n\n\nYes, these are rather broad terms, and we understand it doesn\u2019t address everything under the sun, but as I said above, I don\u2019t believe this is possible, and it needs to be addressed on a story-by-story basis.\nThe whole point of the moratorium is to put a stop on a trend which dominates the subreddit. We shouldn\u2019t have to make a list of acceptable and unacceptable conditions in which we would accept or reject a story based on how close to the trend it is skirting. We\u2019re literally saying, \u201cSay away from this troupe. Come up with something else. Be creative.\u201d\n\nComing up with ways to come as close to a rule violation or a subject matter with a moratorium on it will probably land you in the subversion category because it is literally trying to do exactly what we\u2019re telling you not to do.\n\nWe understand this isn\u2019t a great thing to do. We don\u2019t wish to do it, but there\u2019s only so much we can do to force authors to be more creative in their work. Just because something is popular doesn\u2019t mean we need to fill the subreddit with it. Authors shouldn\u2019t be forced to stick to a single formula to be successful. Whether it is relationship revenge stories or posts imitating other subreddits or having to use clickbait titles, our intent here is to promote creativity and fresh, original stories (and titles). We want to move beyond this overused trope. We don\u2019t want a \u201cwinning formula\u201d to rake in upvotes. It\u2019s not to keep authors down, but to lift them up with the power of their words and imaginations."}

A vase of flowers, the same shade of blue as my mom's eyes.\n\n\u201cForget-me-nots,\u201d Darryl explains as I prod the delicate petals.\n\nThe itching gets worse. As I claw at my skin, I notice that I've managed to tear away a small patch on my forearm, revealing soft new skin underneath.\n\nDesperately, I grab the edge of the patch and pull. The outer layer of my skin peels off easily. My new skin is dewy and pink, like the nurses\u2019.\n\nI pull. A strip across my mouth comes off, taking with it my lips.\n\nI scream, but the sound dies somewhere between my throat and my new, mouthless face. I meet my frightened gaze in the mirror. My brown hair has fallen out, replaced by shining blonde waves. My eyes have turned blue.\n\nThe door bursts open, and nurses rush in, wheeling a bed.\n\n\u201cSixty seconds to delivery,\u201d Darryl announces as arms grab me and push me onto my back on the bed. My stomach feels bloated. I look down to discover that it has swelled to several times its usual size.\n\n\u201cThirty seconds to delivery.\u201d\n\nI feel movement, like a rough mass scraping my insides as it slides through me. Pain explodes in my head.\n\n\u201cSuccessful delivery,\u201d Darryl says calmly.\n\nI sit up, and something slimy is pushed into my arms. It is a wrinkly brown baby that yells at me while punching the air with tiny fists.\n\n\u201cAnother mayfly,\u201d Darryl says, followed by groans from the nurses. I lean over her, my hair brushing her cheek.\n\n*I'll protect you,* I think, but I am already slumping in exhaustion. My eyes find the mirror.\n\nA silver-haired woman stares back. I reach up to touch my face, and she does the same with a frail, liver-spotted hand.\n\nHer eyes are still blue, like forget-me-nots."}

I miss them, but I want to spare them the sight of my pathetic struggle. My fight that I WILL lose. Just like Grandmother.\n\nFoolish youngling that I was, I stayed near her in the end. I remember how she fought to stay afloat, squeezing out a few more minutes of life, even though those minutes were filled with pain and terror and indescribable tiredness. Even though I was by her side she barely noticed me. Barely heard my high cries. I saw her final exhale. Saw the panic in her eyes as her lungs filled with water. I saw her fall. I followed her as long as I could, until my lungs burned just like they do now.\n\nI curse the great mother sea who feeds and shelters us but dooms us all with that horrific end. I envy the fish who never fear drowning. I envy the prey meat who die quick between our mighty teeth. I even envy Kia, slaughtered by the tiny land hunters on their roaring beasts. I\u2019m sure her last moments were pain and terror. But at least it ended quickly. Not like this. If only I could just inhale the salty death and end it. But my stubborn body refuses.\n\nDazed, I realize the sun has risen. That\u2019s nice, I think. Or maybe worse. To leave the light behind as I sink. I can\u2019t decide. I smell the land, hear gulls cry. Without noticing, I have swum closer to the beach.\n\nI jolt awake. The beach!\n\nI push myself hard, my tailfin pounding the water. I must reach it. I must!\n\nNow I lay here with eyes closed against the glare. The sun dries my skin, the sand itches beneath me. I feel heavy, breathless. But satisfied. I escaped the great mother\u2019s cold, dark fangs. I am dying, but not drowning. I can rest.\n\nWeird noises mix with the seabirds\u2019 cries. Heavy thuds on the sand. I lift a heavy lid. The tiny hunters. Without their beasts they look so small. Do they smell my weakness as I smelled the prey meat in the water? \u2018Do what you must,\u2019 I think, closing my eyes to welcome death.\n\nA splash of water. Then another. What is happening? I open my eyes. They are pouring water on me. They wrap nets around me. But I am already out of the sea\u2014what are they doing? They push and pull, slow and steady. Horror grips my heart as I realize:\n\nThey are returning me to the water. Back to HER.\n\nPanic surges as the sea reclaims me. The light fades. The gulls\u2019 cries grow distant. I\u2019m sinking.\u00a0  \nThe great mother will not let her children go. She will claim them all in salt and water and darkness.\n\n\u00a0"}

Yet the note stuck to his fridge by a Looney Tunes magnet still filled him with an unbridled, almost existential, dread:\n\n**Colonoscopy - Friday, 8:00 a.m.**\n\nHe'd never had a colonoscopy.

And because he wanted the truth to hurt *like it fucking should.*)\n\nThen it began.\n\nThe doctor produced a black colonoscope, which to Mr. Ashmnemusthphephnom resembled a long, thin mechanical snake with a light-source for a head, and inserted the shining end into Mr. Ashmnemusthphephnom's rectum.\n\nMr. Ashmnemusthphephnom's eyes widened.\n\nWith his focus on a screen that his patient could not see, the doctor worked the colonoscope deeper and deeper into Mr. Ashmnemusthphephnom's colon.\n\nOne foot.\n\nThree\u2014\n\n(The room felt too cold, the gown too tight.

George grinned and strolled toward him.\n\nOver the past few days, he'd been harassing the mime in any way he could.\n\nThe first day, he'd run over and kicked his box; he was disappointed it was empty.\n\nThe second day, he'd brought a squirt gun and emptied it onto the mime multiple times; a drinking fountain was nearby for refills.\n\nOn the third day, the teen'd brought a slingshot, along with two pockets brimming with rocks. He pelted the mime over and over\u2014first the body, then the crotch, and eventually even the face.\n\nDespite the kid's multiple assaults, the mime had stayed in character, not making a sound. But after George'd hit his groin? The mime's act consisted of one move\u2014a stone-faced glare in his direction. George wouldn't have admitted it, but the unwavering blackness of the mime's eyes unsettled him. The last two rocks he'd shot at the man hit him in the cheek and forehead\u2014drawing blood; he didn't flinch.\n\nToday was the fourth day, and George had left his unease at home. Today he'd planned to steal the mime's box, and put an early end to his stupid charade.\n\nHe walked casually at first, but once he got close, he ran and grabbed the box by the handle. As soon as he attempted to run off with it, the box wouldn't budge. It was a cheap and raggedy cardboard, but in his fingers it was as unyielding as stone.\n\nThe mime knelt down beside him and made a gesture around his wrists. George snickered but then the ratchet of handcuffs reached his ears. He looked down; saw nothing. He released the box and tried to pull away; he couldn't. The mime smiled loudly and jokily bobbed his head while pointing to the boy's wrists.\n\nGeorge screamed, but it was deafeningly silent. The mime's eyebrows raised and he smirked; he held a long and dirt crusted finger up to his lips.\n\nThe teen boy frantically struggled against the invisible binds and shouted to no avail. Several amused spectators gawked and chuckled at the boy's passable performance; the mime watched as well, playing into the crowd's bemusement.\n\nHe held up a hand in a \"wait and see\" gesture and the crowd quieted, gathering closer. With great effort, the mime hefted the massively empty cardboard box and placed it onto the pier banister. George still pleaded to the growing audience as he desperately worked to free himself from the accursed anchor.\n\nThe mime wiped the sweat from his brow and motioned for a small woman to assist him. With great glee\u2014and little effort\u2014the woman pushed at the box and it teetered and fell from the railing, pulling George along with it.\n\nWith an oddly silent plunk, the box and George plunged into the dark and calm waters below; the crowd cheered raucously."}

In the photo, she had demon eyes- you know, completely black weird eyes, like in tv shows.\n\nIn real life, her eyes were normal bluey-brown like everyone else, I think.\n\nI blurted out \u201cOh look Julia has demon eyes!\u201d\n\nMy sister snapped \u201cStop being stupid!\u201d and whipped her phone away- a picture of them in their junior prom dresses. My mom said \u201cOh baby, that\u2019s just the mascara\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure then what mascara was - I found out it was that black stick girls poke in their eyes\u00a0to look like demons, because that is what ~~they are~~ makes them prettier.\n\nSoon after I got my own phone for my birthday, I made my own Instagram account. I requested Julia, and she accepted me. I looked at her photos. Yup, all demon eyes. Even her sisters in some photos had demon eyes. But Julia had them in all. I could see she was a very pretty girl otherwise, and my sister and all their friends had comments underneath her photos like \u201cSlay, queen\u201d \u201cUr my idol!!!!\u201d \u201cU rule!\u201d- you know, which is just the kind of thing you would say to demon, to keep it happy with you.\n\nMy sister didn\u2019t bring her friends over much- she said our place was crowded and also I weirded them out. I was just trying to look to see if Julia actually had demon eyes. My sister told me to stop staring, perv, and shoo\u2019d me out of her room.\n\nBut then Julia moved to a house very close to us with a swimming pool, and of course Mom made my sister take me whenever she went to hang out over summer. My sister hated that, but there was nothing she could do.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t keep staring at Julia, weirdo. She already has a boyfriend! And never in a million years will she look at you!!\u201d\n\nIt was so sunny around the pool, with the sun shining off the bright blue water that I couldn\u2019t do much staring anyway. But even though it wasn\u2019t a photo anymore and I was not staring, Julia was staring at me, with black demon eyes.\n\nI felt headachy and told my sister I wanted to go home. She grumbled and told me to go by myself, and went inside. So I was alone with Julia by the pool. A shiver of terror ran through me.\n\nShe looked at me full on and smiled an open-lipped, sharp-toothed smile.\n\nI saw her forked tongue, flickering in her mouth.\n\nThen she turned and did a perfect dive under the bright blue water.\n\nI didn\u2019t hesitate, I jumped right in and held her under. She didn\u2019t struggle much, she was a small girl, after all.\n\nI got out after she was perfectly still. My sister hadn\u2019t come back yet. I left the backyard.\n\n\u00a0"}

It simply was \u2014 tall, skeletal, its skin like wax stretched thin over broken bones. A tattered nurse\u2019s uniform hung from its sagging frame. Black liquid oozed from the holes where its eyes should have been. Its mouth \u2014 slack, too wide \u2014 quivered slightly as if breathing through the rot.\n\nI forced myself not to react, not to glance away from Sarah\u2019s anxious face. Not to betray what I saw looming inches from her shoulder.\n\n***\u201cThey whisper to me,\u201d*** she said, tugging at the hem of her sleeve, unaware of the thing towering behind her. \u201cThey say awful things.

My hand gripped the pen until my knuckles ached, but I kept writing, nodding, pretending. Pretending I didn\u2019t see it, pretending the world hadn\u2019t already begun to split.\n\n***\u201cThey\u2019re waiting,\u201d*** Sarah said faintly. ***\u201cFor you to see them too.\u201d***\n\nMy blood iced. Her words weren\u2019t desperate. They were resigned.\n\nIt shifted, now only a breath away from me. Its unseen eyes widened, hollow and hungry. I smelled earth, and sickness, and the raw metal scent of things better left buried.\n\nI ended the session early, voice calm, hands shaking.\n\nSarah smiled sadly as she stood to leave, her shadow folding into the specter\u2019s body like a lover returning home.\n\nI didn\u2019t look back.\n\nI didn\u2019t need to."}

He told himself it made the deed humane.  \n\nToday\u2019s prisoner was different.  \n\nThe man was thin, all sinew and feverish eyes, hauled up the steps for butchering six girls in the woods. He claimed it wasn\u2019t his work, but His\u2014a \u201cDark Minister\u201d with horns and cloven feet. The crowd jeered as the warden read the sentence, but the man just smiled, lips moving in a ceaseless murmur. Latin, maybe. Elias didn\u2019t care. Monsters always broke before the rope.  \n\nYet when Elias leaned in\u2014\u201cAny message?\u201d\u2014the man\u2019s grin widened. \u201cCloser,\u201d he rasped.

But as his fingers curled around the wood, warmth flooded his veins\u2014not blood, but something hungry. It coiled behind his ribs, purring. He\u2019d felt this once before, as a boy, when he\u2019d found a wounded fox in the woods. How its neck snapped so sweetly in his hands.  \n\nThe crowd roared. The lever clanked. The trapdoor fell.  \n\nBy dawn, the sheriff found the poacher\u2019s daughter in the ferns, throat slit, chest carved with symbols even the priest couldn\u2019t name. The town buzzed like a kicked hive.  \n\nThat evening, a knock.  \n\nElias opened his door to a woman gaunt with grief\u2014Mrs. Vayne, whose husband he\u2019d hanged weeks prior for strangling a barmaid. \u201cThey said\u2026 you had Henry\u2019s last words,\u201d she whispered.  \n\nHe studied her, the thing inside him coiling. \u201cHe said you were a wretched wife. Said he\u2019d have killed you next.\u201d\n\nShe staggered. \u201cLiar\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Clara?\u201d He stepped closer, savoring her flinch. \u201cTwelve now, isn\u2019t she?

On bright summer mornings my cousins and I would be let loose and play until nightfall.\n\nWe would climb the trees, which seemed impossibly ancient, yet teemed with fruit. Their branches grew twisted and curled into shapes that continued to grow in a child's imagination: mountains, castles, submarines and dragons populated the property.\n\nWe would eat more than our fill of apples, raspberries, plums or strawberries, whatever happened to be ripe. Any other fruit, berry or vegetable has always tasted like a watered down version, a cheap knock-off of what that garden provided.\n\nIt was my love for that place of beauty and plenty that sparked my love for gardening. I would follow grandpa for hours and he would teach me how to properly care for the trees, bushes and roots. He was the toughest man I ever knew, yet so gentle with the plants, and with me. I became his favorite grandchild, obviously.\n\nAs we grew older, my cousins all lost interest and their visits became rare occurrences. I would visit every day. Nothing could beat the scent of fresh earth, the feeling of soil between my fingers; I loved the work as much as I loved the produce.\n\nMy parents, uncles and aunts never seemed to understand. I overheard them several times talking about \"the potential of the property\". How rich they would be when grandpa finally gave in. I dreaded the day.\n\nBut grandpa kept up his gardening even as my parents grew old, strong as ever. He only ate what the garden gave him and it would seem it took care of him, just as he took care of it. He went on to outlive all his children.\n\n***\n\nNow on his deathbed he let us know, much to my cousins' dismay, that I would be the sole heir to the property. The land is valuable, sure, but I'm the only one who knows how to care for it. I'm the only one who doesn't view it as a giant pile of money.\n\nI should have seen them coming, those greedy cousins of mine. The details are blurry, but...\n\n I'm quite certain they killed me.\n\nAnd as a last, cruel joke they've buried me a full six feet down where no one will ever find me, to be fertilizer for my own beloved garden.\n\nThat was their mistake. \n\nThis place is old and its roots go deep. As they embrace me I know it's true: I've taken care of the garden and now it takes care of me. Surely I was dead, but I can faintly hear my cousins celebrating up at the house. I know what I have to do. I smell the fresh earth and feel the soil between my fingers. Only five feet to go. \n\nThe garden is helping. \n\nFour feet.\n\nThe roots are pulling me up.\n\nThree feet.\n\nThey'll regret sticking around.\n\nTwo feet.\n\nThey'll regret not knowing the garden."}

Clutching my wife's hand for dear life as the doctor ordered her to push. When I heard my daughter's wails, I immediately rushed over and held her in my arms. Her skin was so pink. So flush and bursting with life. I just looked at her, until the tears prevented me from seeing anything.\n\n\n\nAnd when I think about when she died, I am once again sitting alone at the kitchen table, hearing the heavy knock on the door. When they told me the news, I felt myself die as well. My body moved on autopilot when I went to the morgue to identify her body. They were still trying to get details and understand what had happened. They told me not to look at anything else in the room. Some of the bodies were unidentifiable due to the brutality, but strangely, my daughter died in one piece. They left, giving me time to process.\n\n\n\nI lifted the blanket. She looked so at peace. Like she was simply asleep. At rest. My heart ached, yet something didn't feel quite right. No... something was very, very *wrong*. I don't know why, but the table on the other side of the room called out to me. I turned my back on my daughter, and proceeded towards it. \n\n\n\nDespite the warning, I lifted the blanket. I nearly gagged at the mess of body parts on the table. But one of the arms was still fully intact. And on it, was strapped a faded, pink watch.\n\n\n\nI turned back around. The body was gone. The only thing that was moved in the room was the swinging door of the morgue.\n\n\n\nMuch like my wife, my daughter died giving life to another being.\n\nAnd whatever it was, it now bore my daughter's face.\n\n\n\nAnd despite my grief and agony, I couldn't help but have a darkly humorous thought.\n\n\n\nI was a granddad now.

She could probably sleep in another five to 10 minutes but doesn\u2019t like to rush. She sits up in the bed while her husband, Michael, snoozes away. Sometimes she smiles at him, other times she scowls. Sometimes she doesn\u2019t look at him at all. Either way, she doesn\u2019t stay in bed long before moving downstairs to the kitchen and preparing Leah\u2019s lunch.\u00a0\n\nLeah is in the third grade and hasn\u2019t gotten to the point where she hates school. School can be awful for those who are different. Kids will do cruel things to one another, and adults often don\u2019t care. Hopefully, this won\u2019t be a problem for Leah.\u00a0\n\nLeah meets her mother downstairs, where Amanda has prepared a plate of fruit and toast. As Leah finishes up her food, Michael descends the stairs and greets them both with a kiss on the cheek. He\u2019s wearing his red polo shirt with a laminated nametag. He steals a grape from Leah\u2019s plate and laughs as she sticks her tongue out at him.\u00a0\n\nThe house feels dead after they leave. Sometimes, the orange cat named Milo will prowl the halls looking for crumbs or insects. Milo used to growl and hiss into the air at all hours of the day, but he\u2019s gotten used to the smells he once thought of as foreign. A few well-placed treats also helped him calm down.\u00a0\n\nAmanda is the first to return home. She goes upstairs and changes out of her work clothes into a comfortable pair of leggings and a loose-fitting shirt. Her afternoon routine usually involves watching several reality show episodes, and then gardening. Today, she watches a little more TV than usual and falls asleep on the couch.\u00a0\n\nShe\u2019s been having trouble sleeping lately. It\u2019s hard to tell why, but it probably has something to do with the many letters she\u2019s been getting and instantly throwing away.\u00a0\n\nMichael is next. He always looks so worn out. Working at a department store is a far cry from the nice office job he once held, but he took what he could to support his family. I respect that.\n\nLittle Leah\u2019s bus drops her off an hour later. She looks like she's had a hard day, but she doesn't talk to her parents about that kind of stuff. She cries in her room when she thinks she\u2019s alone, though.\n\nDespite everything, by the end of the day, they\u2019re a family again. We\u2019re a family again. They haven\u2019t seen me, but I can tell they know I\u2019m here. I catch Leah glancing at the vents from where I\u2019m watching her. Sometimes, I whisper a \u201chey\u201d to her and I'm pretty sure she smiles.\u00a0\n\nMaybe I'll come out of the wall today. I've been planning to for months now. Then, we can all be a real family.\u00a0"}

There were about fifty of us crammed in there, sweaty, scared, clutching whatever we could carry. No one knew exactly what was happening outside, but we all felt it: the deep rumble of something tearing the world apart.\n\nThe shelter had everything we needed: food, water, even some old board games from the Cold War days. A few people joked we\u2019d be fine, like some messed-up sleepover. Days passed. Then a week. We rationed food, kept each other sane, waited for news.\n\nNothing came.\n\nOne guy, Mark, was the first to crack. Started pacing, muttering about how we couldn\u2019t just sit there. Said the air smelled wrong. Nobody wanted to admit it, but he was right. The shelter was getting stale, heavy. People started coughing more. Sleeping less.\n\nOn the twelfth day, we made a decision. We\u2019d send a group topside to check things out. Five volunteers, including me.\n\nWe climbed the ladder, unbolted the hatch, and pushed it open.\n\nSunlight blinded us at first. The air was crisp, clean. And the world, it was fine. No fire, no monsters, no destruction. Birds chirped. Trees swayed. Kids rode bikes down the street like nothing had ever happened.\n\nWe stumbled out, laughing, crying. Somehow, we had survived the apocalypse that never was.\n\nThen I looked back at the shelter entrance.\n\nIt was gone.\n\nNo hatch. No building. Just smooth concrete, like it had never been there at all.\n\nAnd the five of us standing there, we weren\u2019t casting shadows.\n\nNone of the people around us looked at us.\n\nBecause we weren\u2019t there anymore.\n\nWe never left the shelter."}

I wasn\u2019t human anymore. I hid among rats, lived in the shadows.\n\nUntil her. An angel. She spoke to me, fed me, told me everything would be okay. I was reborn. I followed her, watched her, collected her nails, her hair, her photos. A drop of her blood was my most sacred treasure. She lived in me, like a god in its temple.\n\nOne day, I decided to thank her. I bathed under a faucet, covered my face, stole a rose, and went to see her. But I found her kissing another man. Something cracked inside me.\n\nLater, I saw him hit her. I screamed, grabbed my knife, and rushed in. I killed him. But when she saw me, she looked at me like I was a monster. She hit me and ran.\n\nI chased her through the misty forest.

I tried not to stare, but I was mesmerised. \u00a0\n\nI stared.\u00a0\n\nThe sounds of the park and the happy people inside it receded to the background.\u00a0\n\nEventually the other person on the bench got a good grip on the skin which was separating from their thumb, and began pulling it. I was thrilled. \u00a0\n\nA drop of scarlet blood swelled up on the skin which was now being stretched away from the hand, almost the thinness of a taut thread. The blood glistened in sun. I caught sight of the face, which was twisted in pure ecstatic agony. I knew from experience how much it must hurt. \u00a0\n\nThey pulled the thread further and further, and I heard the sharp gasp of pain. In front of my eyes, they began unravelling. \u00a0\n\nI glanced around. No-one else seemed to be noticing this unravelling human on the park bench. \u00a0\n\nThey fully unravelled their whole hand, winding the threadlike skin around their other hand, but never letting go. They pulled and pulled.\u00a0\n\nWithin a matter of seconds, there was pile of bloody skin-thread on the park bench. A couple of scattered articles of clothing lay beneath. \u00a0\n\nI got up, and slowly strolled away. I couldn\u2019t think of anything else to do. \u00a0\n\nThe first really warm day of the year. \u00a0"}

Cracks had begun to appear, and eventually the looming silhouette of a figure was visible. Each night, this person took a step or two closer to the mirror, and each night Lainey echoed their movements, similarly making her way closer to the mirror, step at a time.\nThe closer she got, the more afraid she felt. The more afraid she felt, the faster she moved.\n\nUntil one night, she was standing directly in front of the mirror, heart racing, begging herself to wake up, or at the very least, run away.

She peered into the mirror, this time with a clear view of who waited inside. \n\nIt was a man, with hollow bleeding eyes and a gaping, rotten hole for a mouth. His flesh leaked from his bones, chunks splattering the ground around him. She was alarmed to find she could smell his putrid scent emanating from the mirror. He lifted one pustule covered hand. Lainey had no control over her own body as her hand rose in tandem with his. She tried with all her might to stop, to not mimic his movements, but it was impossible. Their hands moved closer. As she placed her hand on the cracked, jagged surface of the mirror, she felt his oozing flesh wrap around her fingers and begin to slowly pull her through. The mirror tore and ripped at her skin. She screamed as the figure forced her helplessly through to his side of the glass. Her face was one of the last parts of her to be dragged through. Her eyes were torn from their sockets, her lips sliced harshly away to reveal teeth and bone. Upon her full arrival into this new, dark hellscape, the decomposing man spoke in a deep, almost demonic voice. \n\n\u201cFor hundreds of years I have been stuck, cursed to an eternity inside this godforsaken mirror.

And so, the curse continues.\u201d \n\nAlthough unseen by Lainey, his body collapsed in upon himself and left a sludge of flesh and pus where he had been standing.

We could only keep running from that man with the impossibly long stride.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAnd then, one night in Denver, there was another brilliant flash from outside.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBeside me on the nightstand was empty camera packaging.\u00a0\n\n\n\nLanky Joe had started a new project.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHowever, this time, I didn't scream.

Mostly, she ignores us.\n\nBut what unsettles me most is what she does out there.\n\nShe leans over her railing\u2014*far*, dangerously far\u2014and cranes her neck toward the balcony next to hers. Not looking down at the street, not at the sky\u2014*just* the next balcony. She bends out at such a steep angle it looks like she could fall. And then she just stays there. Frozen.

She was consumed by the curse, yet she found a strange sense of purpose in it. She now hunted those who carried unbearable shame and guilt, those trapped in their own sorrow. She would end their suffering\u2014by claiming it for herself.\n\nAnd so, The Cradle Witch roams, a creature of agony and vengeance, offering dark release to those who are drowning in their own remorse. In her arms, the lost find peace, but it is peace that no one truly seeks. "}

The government denied any doing while the science community verified what didn\u2019t cause it.\n\nMany tried taking photos and videos, but nothing ever seemed to work around it. It was a popular spot for teenagers at one time. They loved chuckin\u2019 all kinds of crap down there. But when asked what they all heard they answered the same, nothing.\n\nOver time it just became part of life, but weirdly the town\u2019s numbers started to dwindle. There were rumors folks had gone missin\u2019, but we figured they just moved outta town.\n\nLike many, I myself went down to see what all the huff n\u2019 puff was about. Somethin\u2019 was off in the air as soon as I arrived. It\u2019s difficult to explain, but it\u2019s as though Mother Nature was wounded herself. I gazed into the black depths and felt immense pressure. The kids couldn\u2019t have said it better \u2014 it was nothingness.\n\nMy blood froze from the eerie silence it gave. There was not a bird or bug chirpin\u2019 nearby this damn thing. Time came to a standstill at the edge. Even sunlight dissipated in the void. It may have been in my head, but for a moment I heard it whisper, asking me to enter its black jaws without a second\u2019s thought. I scrammed outta there and didn\u2019t look back. Whatever that hole was, it wasn\u2019t right.\n\nTime carried on for the rest of the world, but for us we were losing our own. People from town went missing one after another. Reports bombarded the sheriff\u2019s office, but him and his men weren\u2019t able to help. It wasn\u2019t until we noticed shoes, toys, phones, and more all trailed down toward one area \u2014 the hole.\n\nMr. Byers, a local wild lifer, set up a trail cam outside the perimeter to see what was happening. What we saw on that footage haunted us all. There on the screen, our friends and loved ones, dancin\u2019 with death, calmly plunging themselves headfirst into the abyss.\n\nWe showed the world what was happening in our backyard. Uncle Sam came a knockin\u2019, trying his best to take control. But not even them soldiers were safe from it.\n\nIt's been a year since the hole\u2019s arrival. The government ruled the town uninhabitable and told the locals to move out. It was too late for us, though.\n\nEven now, no matter how far away I live, I still hear its whispers. It calls for me in my dreams, standin' at the edge of that crater, walkin' off into the pitch black. I fall, forever, screamin' at the top of my lungs, but no sound comes out.\n\nI leap outta bed in a cold sweat, gaspin' for air, not knowin' if I'm awake or still fallin'. If what I felt is what those poor souls are still goin' through, I pray the Lord has mercy on them.\n\n\u00a0"}

I didn\u2019t have a life worth remembering much before I met your mother.\n\nAnyway\u2014me and Cindy were at a drive-in. You know what that is? Like a theater, but outside in your car.

I couldn\u2019t think straight. I went straight home and sat in the shower for probably a few hours.\n\nI did call Cindy later. She wasn\u2019t mad. Said she got a ride with some other guy. I apologized, but here\u2019s the thing\u2014I didn\u2019t really feel bad. I asked for her friend\u2019s number\u2014your mother. Said it was for homework help. She gave it to me, and I never called Cindy again.\n\nI didn\u2019t feel anything for Cindy after that night.\n\nSomehow, I just knew. She wasn\u2019t the one He was talking about.

They can be anything, from snacks to poems, just something to say \"sorry I'm being disruptive while you're sleeping\". You also have to set them out *before* you enter the bathroom. Otherwise they'll believe they're being tricked, and that's almost as bad as not bringing an offering to begin with.\n\nI always enforce this rule when my friends come over for slumber parties, which is rare nowadays due to it. They think it's undiagnosed OCD; I wish it was that easily explained. Don't get me wrong; I've seen how debilitating OCD can get, but this isn't something a therapist can help me with. This is just how it's always been.\n\nAnd I know what happens to those who don't listen to the rule.\n\nWhen I was 15 my friends Chloe and Emily wanted to have a sleepover. There was a new horror film set to stream at around 1 am; we knew that if we didn't watch it live, we'd be bombarded by spoilers.\n\nChloe was first to arrive; Emily had agreed to babysit her siblings, so the two of us just played some games, chatted, and prepared snacks for the film. I was excited when thunder began to boom; storms were the perfect ambiance for a horror film.\n\nAt about 11:59 pm, there was a knock on the door. When I opened it, Emily greeted me with a huff; she and her backpack were drenched in muddy water.\n\n\"What the hell happened?\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Some dumb seniors did a drive-by past a puddle while I was biking over here,\" she groaned as she stepped inside. \"God, I feel like shit; can I use your shower?\"\n\nI glanced down at my watch; 12 am. Almost immediately Emily growled.\n\n\"Are you shitting me, Billie? You're still on about that ritual?\"\n\n\"It's not a choice--\"\n\n\"Yeah, I know OCD's not a choice, but there's a thing called exposure and response prevention therapy. Just....can you two see if you can salvage anything in my backpack?\"\n\n\"I dunno....maybe you should just--\" Chloe began.\n\n\"Shut it, Chloe.\"\n\nWithout another word, she shoved past us and went to get a towel. My stomach began to churn when I heard the door shut, but I stayed put; there was nothing I could do.\n\nI tried to distract myself by searching her bag; about a minute later, a shriek of agony shattered my anxiety. As I rushed upstairs, I could hear hissing sounds from inside the bathroom, but I had no luck getting inside until about two minutes later; when I barged in, nausea hit me. Emily was no longer in the shower; in her place was a pile of bloody, eroding bones.\n\nI'd seen this happen before, but it always makes me sick. Though I can't exactly blame them.\n\nEven spirits need sleep, after all."}

I\u2019ve led people through burning cities. I\u2019ve calmed tsunamis with only my voice.\n\nIn one life, I was stoned in a marketplace for speaking truths too bitter for the time. In another, I watched a tree bloom after saying a single word to the angel guarding it.\n\nIt\u2019s exhausting.

I believe they are divine messages.\n\nBut no one ever believes me.\n\nHowever, among all those chaotic worlds, there's one place I remember the most.\n\nThere were no monsters. Nothing to save. Just gentle, golden light. The trees shimmered like they were breathing. The sky was full of birds in colours I\u2019d never seen before.\n\nIt was the smoothest warp I\u2019ve ever had.

Not as a savior, just as a person.\n\nThen I blinked, and she was gone.\n\nI had no time to grieve because I got warped again. This time as a nurse in a dystopian city, tending to the wounds of cyborg soldiers.\n\nBut I know the pattern. I\u2019ve returned to the same place more than once before. I know I\u2019ll see her again. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow. But someday.\n\nWhen I\u2019m called, I\u2019ll go. And next time, I\u2019ll tell her I love her.\n\nI\u2019ll hold her hand before God warps me away again, so I can carry her with me wherever I go.

Or even my grandson, although I haven't seen him since he was a child. I'm struggling to recall their faces. It's been so long and my memory has been slipping lately. I'd seek them out, but I'm too old and frail to leave the house alone these days. I wouldn't make it far. So here I sit, as my supplies dwindle, waiting for starvation or rescue. It's fine, I've made my peace with that. I've always preferred being by myself anyway, and I still have my books, so it's not all bad. But even for me, it does get lonely.\n\nCreaking sounds? The front door! My surprise is nothing compared to the shock written on the face of the man who stepped into my home. He just stares at me. Fight, flight or freeze, his body chose the latter but the genuine warmth of my smile seems to gradually thaw him.\n\n\"I thought this whole block was abandoned,\" he eventually manages. It is, except for me. I bet he's going door to door, grabbing anything of value left behind. He can't have found much, I did that myself long ago.\n\n\"Please, come in, sit down.\" I don't care if his intention was to rob me. I'm just grateful that someone finally found me. I'm saved.\n\nHe grabs the seat at the table opposite me. We get to talking, nervously at first. You can't trust anyone these days, but our guards drop quickly as the conversation advances. He can tell he's got nothing to fear from this old bag and I can tell I have nothing to fear from him. His eyes are kind.\n\nAs often is the case when strangers get to talking, we discover we have more in common than you'd think. We're probably both just happy to have someone to talk to. I can tell he's hungry just by looking at him and offer what little I have. He doesn't need to know it's all that's left. That doesn't matter now and I don't want to ruin the mood. I'm already certain he will help me out.\n\nHe refuses politely at first, knowing I'm in a tougher spot than him, but I insist and soon he's eating with gluttonous intensity. His kind eyes even tear up with joy. This is convenient. Because he doesn't notice I'm moving closer. Doesn't notice the hand in my pocket. Doesn't even notice the knife until it's in him. \n\nHe's skinnier than the previous one, but if I'm careful, he'll last me another two months. I do hope another visitor comes before then. I'll get by for now, but it does get lonely."}

Instead, pulling me into a hug.\n\n\u201cGo into your room and pack the basics,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNo stuffed animals. Just clothes. Then go to the basement and get into the car.\u201d\n\nShe handed me her keys.\n\n\u201cDo you remember your driving lesson with your father?\u201d\n\nI took the keys, my stomach flipping. \u201cMom, what\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t follow you,  drive to Grandma\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know the route.\u201d\n\nBefore I could respond, a loud knock hit the door. Mom pushed me behind her.\n\n\u201cBasement. Now,\u201d she hissed. \u201cGet in the back seat and do not make a sound.\u201d\n\nI ran down to the basement. But three men in white were already waiting. They grabbed me. One crouched in front, clipboard in hand.\n\n\u201cStar Cameron,\u201d he said, flipping through it. \u201cAh, yes. Level five. Autism Spectrum. ASD, which has just been declared a national epidemic.\u201d He pulled out a spray can, spraying an O on my chest. \n\nI could hear my mother screaming. \n\n\u201cLevel 5 to 10s, also known as X\u2019s and O\u2019s, are authorized to come with us,\u201d he said, cuffing my hands behind my back. \n\nHis breath tickled the back of my neck, almost like a laugh, when I tried to get away. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Star. You\u2019re just *sick* like all the other children.*\n\nHe carried me outside, onto a waiting school bus. \n\nI was forced beside a boy with wide, unblinking eyes. There was a red X spray painted on his blue tee. \n\nThe man addressed us all with a too- wide smile. \n\n\u201cThis epidemic *can* be cured with your cooperation! Don\u2019t worry, kids! We\u2019re going to *fix* you.\u201d"}

We\u2019d shared our life stories over french fries; the next day he\u2019d gotten me an interview at the bar where he worked. Before long we\u2019d started dating. I\u2019d always thought no one could ever love me if they knew how disgusting I truly was. But even when I\u2019d told him everything about me, he\u2019d still stayed. I\u2019d promised myself I\u2019d never let anything happen to him.

But the truth is, everyone has a redemption story. Mine\u2019s just hidden behind childhood trauma.\n\nSee, I wasn\u2019t always this way. As a kid, I wanted to be one of the tough ones at school. The kind who\u2019d whistle at girls and swear like a sailor. I laced every sentence with whatever profanities I knew.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t just my mouth. I carried around bits of chalk I stole from the class. Lunchtime was for vandalising walls with dirty words and badly drawn penises. I thought it was art. Or at least, funny.\n\nOne day after school, I saw a word I hadn\u2019t known before, scribbled on the side of a train bridge: *\u201cShitcannon.\u201d* It was written in red chalk, curled elegantly like it was drawn by a drunken calligrapher.\n\nIt was the most absurd thing I had ever seen, I nearly pissed myself laughing.\n\nSo of course, I copied it.\n\nThat afternoon, I marched straight to Mr. Allen's house, the grump across the street who\u2019d yell if your foot even hovered over his grass. I scribbled *shitcannon* across his garage wall in thick red strokes, chuckling to myself the whole way home.\n\nThree days later, he was found dead.\n\nA paperboy saw him slumped on his living room carpet. Nobody bothered investigating because he was old. Maybe it was just his time, after all.\n\nI felt weird, but not exactly guilty. \n\nA few weeks later, someone else died. A bloke a few streets over. Not old this time, mid-40s, lived alone. This one caught the cops' attention.\n\n\u201cBurglary gone wrong,\u201d someone whispered. The man was strangled mid-struggle by the culprit.\n\nThat\u2019s when something twisted in my stomach.\n\nOn the way home from the shops, I passed the man's house, sealed with yellow crime scene tape. As I stole a glance to the backyard wall, I saw that word again. *Shitcannon.*\n\nSame red chalk. Same cursive writing.\n\nI stopped dead in my tracks.\n\nI swore it wasn\u2019t my handiwork this time, but it looked like the first one I had copied. The spacing, the height, even the curve on the \u2018S\u2019.\n\nAnd suddenly, it clicked.\n\nI\u2019d heard about gangs marking targets with graffiti. That word I copied as a stupid joke was some kind of signal that meant \u201ceasy pickings.\"\n\nAnd I\u2019d slapped it on Mr. Allen\u2019s wall like it was nothing.\n\nThey must\u2019ve seen the graffiti and assumed he was next. Then they came for the second guy, their actual hit.\n\nI\u2019d accidentally marked him for death.\n\nThey never suspected me. I was just a kid, no one saw me do it, and the syndicate was arrested soon after. Lucky, I guess.\n\nBut I knew from that day on, I never swore again.\n\nEventually, people started calling me Mr. Polite.\n\nI let them. Sounds better that than Mr. Shitcannon."}

Just her little voice, saying, \u201cHi! I\u2019m not supposed to open the door.\u201d\n\nMy stomach sank.\n\nI rushed into the kitchen, and there he was\u2014right outside the glass back door. Crouched. Smiling. Holding a piece of candy up to the glass like he was offering a treat to a stray animal. His eyes are wide, like he hadn\u2019t blinked in hours. Hair slicked back, but messy at the edges. His grin vanished when he saw me.\n\nI screamed. Loud. He bolted into the woods behind our house so fast he was practically a blur. I didn\u2019t even chase him. I just locked every door and called the police. They came, took some notes, said they\u2019d send someone by to patrol. But we live on the edge of town. Surrounded by trees. It\u2019s easy to disappear out here.\n\nThat night, I made Elie sleep in my room. I barely slept at all, listening to every creak, every gust of wind. I checked the locks four times.\n\nBy morning, I was wiped. Coffee wasn\u2019t cutting it. Elie was back to being her usual self, playing with her doll in her room. I figured\u2026 maybe that freak just wandered off, you know? Maybe he was high. Maybe it was a one-off thing.\n\nThen there was a knock at the door.\n\nI looked through the peephole\u2014it was just the mailman. Harmless. He handed me the usual mail and went on his way. But there was a box on the floor.\n\nI picked it up, nothing written on it. I shouted at the mailman asking where this was from. He told me it was already there when he arrived.\n\n\u00a0I opened it. Inside was Elie\u2019s old toys. They were buried in a box somewhere in the attic. I ran to Elie\u2019s room.\n\nShe was fine. Just playing. Calm.

Maybe we gave it the right vessel. Crowded cities, communications, political unrest. War. Ironic how the apocalypse doesn\u2019t discriminate. Everyone is equally worthless.\n\nI was at work, night shift. Blackouts could happen and had done so a few times over the years, but the backup generators always went online in a few seconds. Not this time. After the quarter of an hour that felt like eternity, I knew something was wrong. It was then the realization hit me that there were no calls from the central. I unlocked my phone, no service. The thing we built our civilization on, the internet, died before everything else.\n\nMy Maglite guided me through pitch-black corridors. Every terminal I passed was little more than plastic, wires, and a black screen. Just for the record, I am writing this with the help of that very same Maglite, but you probably guessed it. I\u2019m down to my last batteries and the light from the LEDs is weaker than yesterday. As I left the perimeter, I found myself in darkness. Streetlights, billboard lights, and all the other sources of illumination were gone. Buildings rose high, menacing pitch-black abominations, ready to collapse on top of me at any time. Black windows like thousands of eyes, watching as I made my way down the street.\n\nFast forward. D+3 days. Evacuation. The military had rolled through the neighborhood a day before. Knocking on doors. Handing out pamphlets. Bring ID, an extra set of warm clothes, and a day\u2019s worth of provisions. Time, location, and group designation. Mine was Group Arcturus. My gut told me to stay away. To hide. Guess more people had the same feeling, because the evac failed.\n\nThe first ten days were okay. Meeting people who, like I,\u201d missed\u201d the evac was common. But turns out we aren\u2019t a tribal species anymore. We need laws. Unwritten rules shaped by thousands of years of civilization. We need law enforcement and authority. Remove this and what are we but frightened apes. Two weeks into the end of the world and people had changed. Thugs, roaming the city, killing for fun. Desperate loners scavenging for whatever could keep them moving one more day.\n\nI am running out of paper so I\u2019ll wrap this up. D+6 months is a whole new world.

They were expanding outward, seeping into alleyways, playing tricks on my bewildered eyes.\n\nLater, safely inside, I stared at the news broadcast.

I didn't have friends, and my relationship with my mom barely developed after toddlerhood. I never knew my father.\n\nIt was perhaps for this reason\u2014coupled with an increasing realization that knowledge was limited; that some things could *at best* be known probabilistically\u2014that I became interested in religion.\n\nSuddenly, it was not the mechanism of existence but the reason for it which occupied my mind. I wanted to understand **Why**.\n\nAt first, the idea of taking certain things on faith was a welcome relief, and working out the consequences of faith-based principles a fun game. To build an intricate system from an irrational starting point felt thrilling.\n\nBut childhood always ends, and as my amusement faded, I found myself no closer to the total understanding I desired above all else.\n\nI began voicing opinions which alienated me from the spiritual leaders who'd so enthusiastically embraced me as the most famous ex-materialist convert to spirituality.\n\nIt was then I encountered the heretic, Suleiman Barboza.\n\n\u201cGod is not everywhere,\u201d Barboza told me during one of our first meetings. \u201cAn *infinitesimal probability* that God is in a given place-time exists *almost* everywhere.

One does not drown in a rainshower.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to meet God,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThen you must avoid Hell, where God never is, and seek out Heaven: where He is certainly.\u201d\n\nThis quest took up the next thirty-eight years of my life, a period in which I dropped out of both academia and the public eye, and during which\u2014more than once\u2014I was mistakenly declared dead.\n\n\u201cIf you know all this, why have you not found Heaven yourself?\u201d I asked Barboza once.\n\n\u201cBecause Heaven is not a place. It is a convergence of ideas, which must not only be identified and comprehended individually but also held simultaneously in contradiction, each eclipsing the others. I lack the intellect to do this. I would misunderstand and succumb to madness. But you\u2026\u201d\n\nI possessed\u2014for perhaps the first time in human history\u2014the mental (and psychological) capacity not only to discover Heaven, but to inscribe myself upon it: man-become-Word through the inkwell-umbra of a cosmic intertext of forbidden knowledge.\n\nThus ready to understand, I entered finally the presence of God.\n\n\"My sweet Lord, the scriptures and the prophecies are true. How long I have waited to see you\u2014to feel your presence\u2014to hear you explain the whole of existence to me,\" He said, bowing deeply."}

I know the answer. I also know what you *think* the answer is. Terror is a simple concept that people like you have made complicated.\n\nYou\u2019ve felt fear. When separated from your mother as an infant, you cried out in fear. When your foot didn\u2019t land quite where you expected it to, you yelped in fear. When a horror movie used a cheap jump scare, you flinched in fear. Fear is the confusing and the unexpected.\n\nYou\u2019ve felt dread, too. It\u2019s impossible for you not to have some sort of uncertainty about the future. Forgetting to study for a test, waiting for your x-ray results to come back, thinking about how you have no idea what you are going to do with your pitiful, miserable life- all very dreadful things. Since you\u2019re a bit of a dullard, I\u2019ll tell you that I am using dreadful condescendingly.\n\nYou\u2019ve haven\u2019t felt terror. It\u2019s not what is found in brushes with death, in moments where your life flashes before your eyes. Close calls and narrow escapes aren\u2019t enough. Terror is found in the knowledge that everything is about to end. It is clear, inevitable, and absolutely certain. There is no halfway point. There is no return. You can trust me when I say that you\u2019ll know it when you see it.\n\nI suppose this feels a bit arbitrary to you. Oxford\u2019s dictionary claims it means \u201cextreme fear\u201d or a malicious small child. Oxford is a hack who has no idea what he is talking about. Cambridge has the exact same definition, and Merriam and Webster are painfully similar in their ignorance.\n\nBut you. YOU. You\u2019ve twisted the definition of terror around so many times it looks like a metaphorical knot. You perpetuate the cycle of linguistic butchery like some sort of sinister toddler (NOT a terror) with a blunt hand axe fashioned from the nightmares of respectable writers. Oxford and Cambridge and Merriam and Webster are gone, but you\u2019re still breathing. You can still learn what terror truly is.\n\nI suggest you start saying your goodbyes."}

My cat, Ruk, was really close to her and now that she's gone, I can tell he's a bit lonely. Especially when I'm at work. I came home a few times to my curtains ripped up, or all the toilet paper in shreds.\n\n\n\u00a0The last straw was when I came home after working late to find he had clawed a hole the size of a dinner plate into the side of the sofa.\n\nI decided I had to do something. I tried different toys, even catnip, but nothing worked. One night while browsing Amazon, I saw a pet camera. It's a tiny camera that records your pet on a live feed so you can monitor their behavior while you're away. It even has an audio function so you can talk to them.\u00a0\n\n\nSounded silly but hey, I love my furry dude so I bought it. I got overnight shipping and installed it immediately. I decided to set it up in my bedroom, as that was where Ruk dwelled most.\u00a0\n\n\nMy first day at work I think I checked that camera thirty times. When I spoke into the microphone, Ruk seemed to be happier, and I noticed there was no destruction around the house either.\u00a0\n\n\nBy day four I figured I'd solved the problem with Ruk.\u00a0\n\n\nThat leads me to right now. About thirty minutes ago I climbed in bed with Ruk, ready to close my eyes, when my phone buzzed. A notification from the pet cam. I almost ignored it, sure I'd just triggered the thing. But I opened it anyway. What I saw made my grip tighten on the phone.\u00a0\n\n\nInstead of a video of myself in bed I saw a man, tall, gangly, with pale skin, and large eyes. He was moving into my room with exaggerated steps, like a sneaking cartoon character.\n\nHe got right up to the lens, so close I could almost smell his rotten breath, and he smiled.\u00a0\n\n\nI immediately paused the video, terrified. I looked at the spot where the man should have been standing, but there was no one there.\n\nI went onto Amazon and found the pet cam, and read the reviews, hoping for some weird glitch. It had to be a joke, right?\u00a0\n\n\nThe first dozen reviews were pretty standard, but it was the last that caused me to bolt upright.\u00a0\n\nThe customer complained that the camera was on a time delay, sometimes as much as fifteen minutes.\u00a0\n\n\nI went back to the video and pressed play with shaky fingers. I watched in horror as the man slithered under my bed, giving the camera a wink before disappearing in the darkness. Then I saw myself enter the room and climb in bed before the video ended.\u00a0\n\n\nNow I'm sitting in my bed, knowing he's under it. I could call the police, but I doubt I'd have time\u2026.\n\n\nSo please, do yourselves a favor and read the reviews.\u00a0"}

I totally forgot. I force myself to smile and blow the candles.\n\nThe cake tastes like soap. Or a cough syrup.\n\nI hide both candles in my pocket when nobody's watching. I guess it\u2019s the only gift I can count on today. \n\nI stop one of the nurses on the way back to my room. I ask if my parents are going to see me.

Did you like the birthday surprise?\u201d she asks, with that annoyingly sweet smile.\n\n\u201cYeah, I forgot today\u2019s *the* day.\u201d\n\nShe takes my hand and says, \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, darling, it happens to everybody.\u201d\n\nAs she holds my hand, I ask her why my skin looks so strange. \n\nNurse Judy gives me a sympathetic gaze. \u201cI think it\u2019s normal at your age, don\u2019t you think so, sweetie?\u201d\n\nIs she trying to make a fool of me? Oh, I've had enough.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m only 17!\u201d I say imploringly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know any other teenager with hands like these! Just look!\u201d\n\nI take the candles out of my pocket and almost rub them in her face.\n\n\u201cYou see?! One and seven! Seventeen!\u201d I bellow.\n\nJudy gently takes the candles from my shaking hands.\n\n\u201cRobin, it\u2019s not seventeen. Let me show you the right order. It\u2019s seven and one.\u201d\n\n\u2026Seventy one."}

I know she\u2019s doing this in hopes that I\u2019ll exchange the box for something less girly, but I\u2019ve told her time and time again that I do *not* negotiate with terrorists, so she isn\u2019t going to get her way by acting immature.\n\nI was set on ignoring her antics, but what\u2019s happened since then is the final straw. She won\u2019t stop playing the damn song. Now, I like a cute little melody as much as the next gal, but she\u2019s had it going 24\/7 since yesterday. I took the key out of the back, thinking it\u2019d fix it, but I\u2019m certain she rigged it because it wouldn\u2019t stop.\n\nLast night I woke up to the infernal song and found my daughter up way past her bedtime, dancing along to the song in the pink tutu I bought her years ago. She wouldn\u2019t even respond to her name, no matter how much I yelled. I know she\u2019s trying to give me what I want to the point that I realize that the \u201cgirly\u201d daughter I want wouldn\u2019t even be *her* anymore\u2026 and, truth be told, I get it now. She *doesn\u2019t* feel like my daughter anymore, and I miss her.\n\nBut, like I said, I refuse to respond to this type of behavior\u2026 AITA here???"}

I have been my whole life. I\u2019m twelve years old. Or am I thirteen? Or eleven? I\u2019m such a good liar that I could convincingly tell you anything. \n\nIt was my father who first taught me how to lie. \u201cLook them dead in the eyes, son. Don\u2019t blink, or look to one side. Dead in the eyes. Speak calmly. Add in some details, ones that aren\u2019t important. That makes things more believable.\u201d\n\nSo every day I concoct a new adventure to tell my classmates, they lap it up. They believe I live in the big mansion, that I only wear tatty clothes because my parents don\u2019t want me to be spoilt. They don\u2019t know that I actually live in a caravan in the field behind it. \n\nLast week I told them that my parents had taken me off to a ski resort for the weekend. \u201cWe met Prince William up there, he loves skiing. I was really bad at it, but Will, (he said I can call him that), said it didn\u2019t matter, because he thought I was really funny. I must\u2019ve fallen over right in front of him about 8 times! We\u2019re going to be invited to dinner at Windsor Castle soon\u201d. \n\nI liked that story. It\u2019s another thing my father taught me about lying, you can\u2019t always paint yourself as the hero. Sometimes you have to be bad at things.\n\nToday I\u2019m telling an even better lie. \u201cThey opened the aquarium especially for me\u201d, I say, breathing evenly, \u201cmy parents just *knew* that I\u2019d always dreamed of swimming with sharks.\u201d I look directly at them. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve all seen, but they have those love little orange fish at the aquarium too, like Nemo! I\u2019ve got a stuffed one from the gift shop, but I\u2019ll get some real ones soon\u201d.\n\n It\u2019s all in the details, the little inconsequential details. \n\n\u201cAnyway, the shark swimming went a bit wrong. The shark tried to attack me, but I fought it off.\u201d I shrug nonchalantly and bask in their awe. One girl asks if she can touch the red gash across my face. \n\nIt was my father who taught me how to lie. I have to be believable when I explain away the injuries he gives me, or he\u2019ll kill me. \n\nI am a good liar, but a very bad boy."}

Someone had broken into our home.\n\nI told my family to wait outside, in case the intruder was still inside. They obliged, and I slowly and silently made my way through our house. As I stepped into the living room, I saw broken furniture, nothing in its correct place, just utter chaos. Was this person looking for something? Did they have malicious intent? Why our home? Why us?\n\nNext, I walked to our kitchen. The fridge had been emptied. Dishes and food were thrown all over the room. What kind of person had broken into our home? A homeless person who just needed food? If so, why had they destroyed the living room?\n\nThat's when I heard it. Footsteps in the bedroom. The intruder was still in our house.

I raised my hand, placed it against the door, and took a deep breath, readying myself for whatever may be on the other side.\n\nI pushed the door open and stepped through the threshold with authority. I couldn't believe my eyes. I actually rubbed my hands over them, thinking I was imagining things. There, in my son's bed, was a young girl with curly blonde hair.\n\nShe stared at me with wide eyes. She must have been terrified. I must have been a few feet taller and at least 100 pounds heavier than her. I must have been a sight to see for that little girl.

He woke up right after with a huge smile on his face thinking we were gonna get naughty, he didn't expect me to take out a handsaw from the garage.\n\n\n\"Babe, watch this,\" I said.\n\n\nI put the hacksaw right at my neck and started slashing away. So much blood poured out of me, you wouldn't believe. It splattered his face and he looked like he came straight out of a horror movie. I was having a hoot sawing my head off and he was just screaming and screaming. It took me a while, but when I was done I did a little dance while holding my head to try and calm him down. That was just one of our things, we liked to dance while joking around.\n\n\nI think I danced for around 10 minutes with my holding head by the hair in one hand and the hacksaw in the other. He just screamed the entire time. I tried to tell him that I was okay, that this was just a joke or whatever, but nothing worked. He would NOT STOP screaming. Finally, I just put my head back and tried to kiss him. He pulled away really harshly and I have to admit it hurt a little.\n\n\nThat was three days ago. Since then he kept trying to make me let him go but I just can't. I love him too much. We're meant to be together, I know it. I've been taking care of him since then though, don't worry. I feed him nice treats, I clean him up when he \"relieves\" himself. I've done all these things but he still won't talk to me properly.\n\n\nI know he'll lighten up eventually, but sometimes he calls me these hurtful names like \"monster\" or \"demon\" or whatever.

We were going faster and faster. My son started sobbing and I tightened my grib on his hand. I thought that he would become such a handsome man someday. He would end up having a good life, and marry a nice girl - or a guy, who knows? I didn't care as long as he was happy. That's all I wanted. For him to be happy and not scared.\n\n\"Hey, you know what? Close your eyes. This will be over soon. I'm here. I'm not letting go.\"\n\nSomeone behind us started to scream. I felt my blood run cold.

There are things in the air \u2014 small, microscopic things, that float like pollen and enter through your nose and mouth. If you\u2019ve ever been out and thought you smelled something sweet, like cotton candy, it\u2019s too late. Your lungs are about to liquefy, slowly, cell by cell. Sorry about that.  \n2. **Only drink from fast moving streams**. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve got a water filtration unit \u2014 never collect water from ponds or lakes. It\u2019s not because of the dead bodies. It\u2019s the half-dead ones. They can stay down there for months at a time, just waiting for someone who doesn\u2019t know better.\n3. **Stay away from settlements**. Any half-decent settlement already has too many mouths to feed. If you ask, they\u2019ll let you in. But they won\u2019t let you stay. They\u2019ve got all those hungry mouths after all.\n4. **Don\u2019t eat the birds**. I don\u2019t know what these new birds are, but they smell like tar and their meat can burn a hole in your throat. Stick with canned goods and cockroaches.\n5. **It\u2019s safe to travel by night**. But if you hear a sound like a ticking stopwatch, stand perfectly still and wait until the sun comes up. They\u2019ll pass you by as long as you don\u2019t move.\n6. **Don\u2019t aim for the heart OR the brain**. Aim for the legs if they can walk. Aim for the arms if they can crawl. Don\u2019t assume anything will stay down for good. Just make sure you can run faster than they can. \n7. **Red sores heal with time**. White sores will rot down to the bone within 48 hours. Remove the limb. Cauterize the wound. That should buy you a few weeks at least.\n8. **The living don\u2019t knock**. If you\u2019re holed up somewhere with four walls and hear someone knocking, ignore it. Whatever it is needs you to let it in and you really don\u2019t want to do that.\n9. **Don\u2019t be alarmed if you see angels**. It\u2019s normal to see beings made of soft light descending from the heavens. It just means there are parasites attached to your optic nerves. They can\u2019t kill you. They\u2019ll just consume your eyeballs from the inside out.\n10. **Always leave one bullet for yourself**. It\u2019s a brave, difficult thing to make a life here in the After. But eventually you\u2019ll get tired. Eventually you\u2019ll see that of all the things you can do during the apocalypse, *surviving* might just be the worst. But that\u2019s for you to discover. Until then, good luck."}

Too much junk, I told myself, not enough food.\n\nMy stomach turned harder when I saw the flashing lights ahead of me, five police cars, and an ambulance in front of a small house. My walking slowed as I got closer. A group of people had gathered around the police tape, warded off by the force field of yellow and black lines.\n\nI walked to the nearest group of people and motioned towards the house with a nod of my head. An old lady near me sighed.\n\n\"Boyfriend held his girlfriend hostage inside, snapped, and killed her when she tried to escape. God rest her soul, she was just a young thing.\"\n\nI looked back at the crime scene, noticing the house number beneath a smear of blood. My breath caught in my throat and I struggled not to choke. My eyes watered.\n\n19 South Street.\n\nThe same house that had ordered the pizza.\n\nSalami.\nOlives.\nSausage."}

In a maximum-security prison, filled with murderers and rapists, the worst thing they can do to you is leave you completely alone. Solitary confinement.\n\nThe human brain needs input, or it quickly descends into horrifying madness of its own company.\n\nIn 2086 when the world government fell into a dictatorship, capital punishment became very common. However, it was solitary confinement that people feared. That was reserved just for treason.\n\nI spent my working life making the solitary confinement cells and carrying out the confinement. Here\u2019s how it works.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe cells are molded to exactly fit the condemned. They are human shaped coffins. Arms out to the side at 30**\u00b0,** legs 45**\u00b0** apart. For the insertion process the traitors are sedated.\n\nThe eyes, ears and mouth are not damaged, but all are sealed permanently shut. An automated breathing tube inserted through the throat.  Three IV lines are inserted to feed nutrients, we use three lines in case of mechanical failure on one. Catheters are inserted to handle waste.\n\nThe condemned are sealed in and buried in the very public, traitors\u2019 graveyard. With enough autonomous supplies to last 80 years, but to be considered dead from that day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNasty right?\n\nWell that has been my job for the last 20 years, and I am pretty numb to the idea of it. One person a day entered the traitors\u2019 graveyard. This was so that the condemned persons story could feature on the evening news. Along with their frenzied begging for a pardon. It hasn\u2019t caused me distress in many years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat was until last week, when I was convicted of treason.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can\u2019t really argue, I\u2019m guilty. But after seeing the things I have seen, is it surprising I turned to murder. This regime needs to be brought down, this barbaric practice of solitary confinement needs to end now!\n\nBut it will take a better man than me to achieve that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday I woke up from the sedation. My eyes and mouth sealed shut. Deafening silence and dazzling blackness greet my panicked brain. Fight or flight response kicks in and I choose between 0 options.\n\nI can\u2019t move an inch, even my fingers are molded in place.\n\nI just keeping thinking about all those people I put down here, all the things I wish I had done differently.\n\nI can\u2019t have been down here for more than a week and I would choose death if I could.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would give anything to take back the treason I committed. The 7,000 people I killed.\n\nI only did it to save others from untold suffering. I did it while they were sedated. A syringe of air into their veins to cause cardiac arrest. One murder each day for 20 years.\n\nIt\u2019s just me alive down here, living the life of a traitor."}

With this product, a person can go a whole work day, and not even know it! It automatically initiates a sleep sequence in the user\u2019s brain, then controls their muscles so that they can do their job while completely unconscious. All of a person\u2019s energy can now be put into the things that really matter: hobbies, family, friends. They never have to think about work again (unless they\u2019re picking up their paycheck!).\u00a0\n\nSoon, this chip became a regular part of life. Some companies even started giving it out for free to employees. It was a win-win: the companies got more efficient workers, and the employees no longer had the stress of a job. You could hardly even tell a person was unconscious, the chip recognises patterns and could converse just like its user would. For a while, this seemed like the perfect system.\n\n3 years after the implementation of the Workday chip, the disease broke out. Nicknamed the Red Flame Disease, it caused a terrible combination of coughing up blood and intense burning pain. It spread like wildfire, and soon the majority of the population was affected. Even though most people were in no state to work, the chips forced them to automatically. There was no off switch, and it was able to pick locks or break down doors in order to get its user to work.\n\nIn the end, it didn\u2019t matter if a person had the chip or not: everyone ended up dead. From the moment you first coughed up blood, you had mere days left to live. The disease didn\u2019t discriminate between the old and the young, every single person eventually succumbed. It all happened so quickly that most bodies never even got taken care of, they were just left in their homes to rot away.\n\nNow roaming the streets are corpses, doing nothing but going through the motions as if they were ghosts. Dead baristas try to ask customers that don\u2019t exist for their order, but some no longer have tongues. Shriveled hands work in factories to produce gadgets for nobody. Businessmen look before crossing the street on their way to work, but no longer have any eyes. These ghost-like beings are stuck in a strange purgatory; they are dead but not at peace.\n\nWatching over these ghosts are the CEOs, the top 1%. They live in elaborate bunkers and clink glasses, laughing about how they will never have to pay another worker again. The WorkDay Chip has no off switch, and that's exactly how it was meant to be."}

But, I don\u2019t have any savings. I can\u2019t pay rent if I don\u2019t go out and make rent money. You know what I need to do. But, I\u2019m not sure I have the stomach to do it.\n\t\nI checked the clock and downed a Benylin shot. *Forty-five minutes until my shift starts*. Gotta get moving. Donning a medical mask, I broke quarantine. \n\t\nAs I rode the bus, disease spewed from my mouth like a thick green fog. My noxious gases carried malicious little germs. A child looked up at me. Microscopic predators scurried across her skin, into her eyes and mouth. Soon she too leaked green. I imagined her sick and dying. I imagined all the people her infernal vapors would infect. She smiled at me. \n\nSmile while you can little one. Smile before the plague begins. \n\t\nGetting off the bus, I watched a thousand subtle suicides. A man on a bench licked ketchup off his hand and began leaking green. A little boy sipped from a public fountain and began leaking green. A woman, already leaking, kissed her husband, regurgitating green into his mouth like a mother bird. I coughed. Bystanders recoiled. If they only saw what I could see. They would break down in tears. \n\t\nWhen I showed up at work Brett yelled at me and told me to take off my mask.

By the time I\u2019d gotten ready and clocked in, plague filled the building like a tainted hotbox. I thought about leaving. I thought about running away. But, I didn\u2019t.

I clicked on the post and gave it an award. A few seconds later, her face lit up.\n\n\u201cEverything okay?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cJust some funny messages in the group chat,\u201d she answered.\n\nFrom there, I stalked her profile daily.

It felt like I\u2019d turned on the cheat codes to our marriage.\n\nBut after I lost my job, her posts took a turn. She began browsing the marriage\/relationship advice subs, and after three weeks of me bombing countless interviews, she asked for tips over on deadbedrooms.\n\nLike I needed a reminder I couldn\u2019t\u2026perform.\n\nIt was hard not revealing I knew she shared intimate details about our relationship with strangers online, but if I told her, she\u2019d just make a new account, and I\u2019d lose my window into her innermost thoughts.\n\nHer original posts had gained some traction, which meant tons of users asked for an update, then she posted about how the situation had gotten worse. She wrote about how now I snapped over every little thing and had even started lashing out. The tension continued to swell.\n\nSoon came the ultimate gut punch, a confession post entitled: *I am terrified of my husband.*\n\nCan you imagine what would have happened if a Reddit user went radio silent after that bombshell? It would have caused a scandal. An investigation.\n\nTalk about your wake-up calls\u2026\n\nI calmed things down by cooking a few romantic meals and told her I was deeply sorry for dumping my frustrations on her. I even bought the damn hair-care package.\n\nThis made her post some positive updates. She wrote that, although we had a long way to go, things were definitely looking up. That we\u2019d be okay.\n\nBut the fact is, things *aren\u2019t* okay. And they\u2019ll never be okay again, now I know what she really thinks of me.\n\nSo I searched for subs she was still actively participating in. Subs like this one. And then I sat down to write my first ever post.\n\nShe\u2019s sitting opposite me as I type this. There\u2019s a knife under my armchair, and I already know how I\u2019ll dispose of the body. Now it\u2019s just a case of waiting for her to read my confession and realize what\u2019s about to happen.\n\nSo if you\u2019re reading this, Maria\u2026it\u2019s time to look up."}

He stopped asking me to pose for his work.\n\nThe passing of time was merciless on my skin, my figure.\n\nOne day I was sitting on the floor, poring over old photographs he had taken of me. Every single shot was a masterpiece. Every set told a story. He had this way of capturing an instant, a fragment of time. A glance, an emotion, a fashion. I often sat like this, staring at his work for hours.\n\nHe came home early that day, catching me eyeing that very first candid from his amateur days.\n\n\u201cYou looked so beautiful, honey,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite myself, I hoped he would leave then. I didn\u2019t want to be emotional, to break down in tears. I was stronger than that. He had no idea, though, how it felt to hear those treasured words spoken in past tense.\n\nHe never saw the efforts I went through to keep my skin clear, to keep my body trim. The injections, the hours spent at the gym, the fad diets, the subsequent eating disorders. I would have done anything to be his muse again. Anything.\n\nBut at thirty I could never compete with the trollops he photographed for work. Eighteen-year-olds with naive eyes, slim waists, and a will to be seen. To be sought by the agents, the world, by him.\n\nHe stopped calling me beautiful shortly after the third girl went missing. The cops kept showing up at his gallery, interrupting photoshoots, preventing his international business trips. When six young models go missing after working with the same photographer... Well, let\u2019s just say the media takes notice of that sort of thing.\n\nHe never asked me out right, but I caught him digging around in my things, snooping my phone, etc. They\u2019ll have a warrant for his arrest any day now, and he\u2019s scrambling to find any proof of his innocence.\n\nHe will never find it, because he isn\u2019t innocent. He\u2019s not innocent of neglecting me, of making me feel lesser than.

Maybe the guy that was being aggressive with me was my boyfriend, and we were just having a fight. Maybe you were afraid to get involved in a stranger\u2019s business.\r\n\r\nBut you saw my nervous, intimidated body language, and you acted. There were couples and groups everywhere, but it took you, another girl alone at the bar, to recognize my struggle and act. \r\n\r\nWe made eye contact, me twisting my body away from the man\u2019s touchy hands, and I pleaded with my eyes. The look you gave me back was more than clear: you understood exactly what was happening to me. You\u2019d probably been through it yourself. \r\n\r\nYou came over, calling me by a generic term instead of a random name. I would\u2019ve played along if you had called me \u201cJen,\u201d or something, but that might\u2019ve led the man to thinking I gave him a fake name. That might\u2019ve pissed him off. You really thought of everything.\r\n\r\n\u201cHey, girl! It\u2019s been such a long time,\u201d you said, extending your arms and a lifeline. \r\n\r\nYou wrapped your arms around me, a different sort of stranger\u2019s touch from the man\u2019s hand on my knee. \r\n\r\nI squealed like we were long lost best friends, and I asked you what you were doing here. \r\n\r\nI remember the dull ache in my stomach when I heard you say that you were celebrating getting your Masters in marine biology. Once upon a time, long before Rob and me ran these schemes in dirty bars, I had been a little girl that wanted to be a marine biologist. \r\n\r\nOh well. That was literally a lifetime ago. \r\n\r\n\u201cOmigod congrats, girl!\u201d I yelled at you violently, and I asked if you wanted to dance. \r\n\r\n\u201cOf course!\u201d You replied, returning my vigor like I had loaned it to you.  \r\n\r\nWe headed out to the dance floor, and I thought long and hard about giving Rob the signal to cancel the whole thing. Your interest in marine biology made me feel guilty for a moment, but I ultimately took it as a sign that you were just my type. That you would taste *wonderful*.\r\n\r\nAnd god knows how hungry I was. \r\n\r\nSo, we danced, leaving behind Rob at the table. He hunkered off, pretending to be dejected. \r\n\r\nNobody noticed him pass by where you had been sitting before. Nobody noticed him pour a small vial of liquid into your drink. \r\n\r\n\u2014\r\n\r\nTLDR: To the woman at the bar last night who noticed my body language: Thank you for being so gullible."}

Can you believe that? The same guy who pulled me over yesterday!\u201d\n\n\n\nI looked at the name of the officer on the ticket. \u201cBabe, I need to tell you something.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I was a freshman there was this classmate who wouldn\u2019t leave me alone. Just kept bugging me. So eventually I caved and let him take me on one date just to shut him up. He was weird. Very weird. Kept saying, \u2018we\u2019re going to get married, have ten kids.\u2019 So I told him it wasn\u2019t going to work out. But he wouldn\u2019t let go, for years. Keep harassing me. I had to switch schools twice just to avoid him. My parents tried to get a restraining order. And I hadn\u2019t thought about him for years until three days ago when he pulled me over.\u201d\n\n\n\nMy husband pointed at the ticket, \u201cThis guy?\u201d\n\n\n\nI nodded. \u201cHe pulled me over for some bullshit reason, then acted like it was a happy reunion.

I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to leave us alone.\u201d\n\n\n\nMy husband angrily crumpled the ticket in his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHow?

Five horrible, gut-wrenching days.\n\n\n\nI walked into the Police Station and told them I needed to report a missing person.\n\n\n\nThe officers were no help. I knew they wouldn\u2019t be. \u201cOh he\u2019s probably run off with another woman.\u201d My husband would never. I didn\u2019t report him missing because they were gonna find him. I knew doing it would get my stalker\u2019s attention.\n\n\n\nI hadn\u2019t even made it halfway home when I saw him in my rear-view mirror. He flashed his lights and I pulled over.\n\n\n\nHe walked to my car with a big smile on his face.

He should have been looking behind him.\n\n\n\nIt made a horrible, disgusting crunch when my husband ran him over. In a human vs. a stolen Kia Optima collision, the car\u2019s always going to win. My husband had been waiting outside the police station just like we planned days ago.\n\n\n\nMy stalker laid on the ground seizing. There was less blood than I expected. Half his skull was missing.\n\n\n\nMy husband sped away and was already out of sight.\n\n\n\nNow all that was left was to call 911 and report a tragic hit and run. It happened so fast. I won't remember many details."}

I think my fianc\u00e9 has a thing for my sister.\n\nWe\u2019re not twins - she\u2019s seventeen months older than me - but we look a lot alike. She always looked better than me, though. Skinnier, nicer skin, bigger rack, you know, the typical gifts the older sister gets.\n\nI always hated her for it - I mean, she wasn\u2019t a bad person, she was always that happy-go-lucky type who tried to make you smile, but that just made me hate her more. I could never measure up - couldn\u2019t get the same grades, couldn\u2019t fit into the same clothes. Even when she tried to include me in her friend groups, I knew she was just doing it to try and be a \u201cbigger person,\u201d which I just hated.\n\n(I have serious self-image issues, if you can\u2019t tell).\n\nAaron is the first thing that was, you know, mine. Unequivocally, absolutely mine. I met him after moving away for school. I never even considered telling my parents about him; Mom and Dad wouldn\u2019t care anyway. All they talked about was golden girl \u2013 Amy, Amy, Amy, blablablabla - like nobody else mattered. Even when I was in the same room!\n\nAaron never met my family, and I liked it that way. I liked who I was with him. He was cute, he was smart, he was sexy, he made me laugh, he made me happy. He said yes when I proposed after a long, sloppy night - and it made me feel like I\u2019d finally done it. I finally came out of Amy\u2019s shadow; I was more to people than just Amy Bradford\u2019s little sister.\n\nSo, I wasn\u2019t thrilled when he surprised me with plane tickets home to see my folks. It\u2019s a chance to make peace with the past, he said, to show them that you\u2019ve survived despite them. I liked the way he put it, but still didn\u2019t want to.\n\nSo of course, he fell in love with her the minute we walked through the door. I mean, he gasped when he saw her, then tried to pretend he didn\u2019t! Like my parents and I didn\u2019t even exist!\n\nHe kept staring at her throughout dinner, just sneaking looks when he thought I couldn\u2019t see, but I saw him. Even when Dad was doing that Dad thing and interrogating him about his goals and education and shit, Aaron kept staring at her.\n\nEven that night while we were in bed, I tried to get something started, and he just turned me down flat and rolled away! I think I heard him crying later that night. I\u2019m sure he wishes he were with her instead of the ugly duckling sister.\n\nIt pisses me off so much. I mean, what else can I do? I\u2019ve already carved her face off (she\u2019s still alive, don\u2019t be weird!). I mean, even my parents have gotten over it! I just want people to see me! What do you guys think?"}

Delving even further I noticed they acted like a total food snob, which led me to believe they\u2019d attend an upcoming Garlic festival.\n\nWell, the big day rolled around, and the 3S fan posted a photo of some Garlic fries to their profile. From the hint of blue sleeve in the picture, I correctly deduced who it was.\n\nI followed him through the car park, tailed him home\u2014hanging back so he wouldn\u2019t notice my pick-up truck\u2014and then watched from across the street as he went into his apartment. Two hours later, the lights flicked off.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve never been prone to violence, but like I say, I poured my heart and soul into that story, and this bastard couldn\u2019t even toss a measly upvote my way.\n\nWanna hear the funny part? When that knife plunged into his throat, a faint smell of garlic wafted throughout the bedroom. I asked if it made him feel like a big man, ignoring somebody\u2019s story, although he was too busy choking on his own blood to answer.\n\nQuickly I made my escape, swearing to stop comparing myself with other writers, and put an end to the violence.\n\nBut the very next day, it happened again. Another flopped story, another user singing praises on somebody else\u2019s post\u2026\n\nSo I stalked their profile, saw they\u2019d asked for suggestions on cruise holidays, and booked myself onto the one he said looked most promising.\n\nThe guy was easy to find\u2014he actually posted a selfie of him and his wife up on deck enjoying the ocean views.\n\nSince I\u2019m not a complete fool, I waited until *after* we disembarked to kill them both.\n\nThings went off without a hitch, but the problem is this subreddit now only has 707,998 active readers (997 if his girlfriend liked 3S too). So, before the glass ceiling gets any lower, I\u2019m begging you: please, please read my stories.\n\nFor all of your sakes\u2026"}

Nobody knows how it works, nobody knows why it's there, but it's there.\n\nIt works simply. All you have to do is send how you wish to die, and your wish will be granted within 5 days. You don't need to be specific, you don't need to put in anything extra- you don't even need to put in your info. They know.\n\nAnd once you send it, there's no turning back. Did you wish to die from a stabbing? Did you wish to die a hero? Did you wish to die from something inappropriate? Your wish will be granted. People die in their own beds from a hooded figure stabbing them to death. People die saving others from fires. People die doing something inappropriate. \n\nPeople die.\n\nI want to die, too. I desperately want it to end. Life is impossible for me to continue to go through, and I don't want to live it anymore.\n\nBut I'm too much of a coward for suicide. So I went for the better option.\n\nI didn't want to die painfully, and I didn't want anyone to mourn over my death. All I wanted was to leave this world peacefully and let everyone else who used to be in my life live their own wonderous lives.\n\nSo I raised my fingers over the keyboard and typed \"I want to die painlessly, and not have anyone weep over my death.\"\n\nOne day passed and I was still alive.\n\nTwo days passed and I was still alive.\n\nThree days passed and I was still alive.\n\nFour days passed and I was still alive.\n\nThe fifth day was the day of the party. I came over to my brother's house, along with most of my family. Today was the day of his party.\n\nEveryone else was singing and laughing, and yet I was sitting in the corner, on my phone. I should've known it was a scam. I should've known it was fake.\n\nI just wanted to die painlessly. Not have anyone suffer over me. So why wouldn't it happen? Why wouldn't I die?\n\nThen I got the notification.\n\nAnd I went pale, realizing my wish came true.\n\nYou don't need to put any info in your email. You don't need to put any extra details in your email. And you don't need to be specific in your email.\n\nBut god, I wish I was more specific.\n\nI looked up at my family, enjoying themselves and completely unaware of what was about to hit them, as the words \"BALLISTIC MISSILE\" burnt into my mind."}

I wasn\u2019t supposed to know, but I did. It wasn\u2019t so much a secret as it was a deep family *shame*. My parents refused to acknowledge it, and as a result he never received the help he so desperately needed. \n\nBut the full extent of his deviancy didn\u2019t become apparent until his early teens, a secret of which I\u2019ve kept from everyone. Even my brother. If he knew that *I* *knew*, I\u2019m not sure what would happen.\n\nIt was an accident. That\u2019s how it all began. We were playing around in my mom\u2019s study, and I knocked over one of her many porcelain figurines, a cute dalmatian puppy, the fragile thing breaking into dozens of unrecognizable pieces as it hit the hardwood floor.\n\nMy brother stared at the broken mess for minutes, before mom stormed in and started yelling. My brother didn\u2019t flinch though. Just stood in silence as she cleaned up, his eyes never leaving the ominous shards.\n\nA few days later our neighbor, Mrs. Zielinski, reported her dog Maja missing. She was a precious dalmatian puppy, little over a year old. They found pieces of her for days. Hacked violently into fleshy bits. A heinous act of pure cruelty, they called it.\n\nAnd I immediately knew it was my brother.\n\nI suppose I still wanted to test my hypothesis though, so a week later I \u201caccidentally\u201d broke another figurine, this time depicting a plump little boy. I ignored my mom\u2019s scolding, keeping my gaze locked on my brother. He didn\u2019t move an inch. Just stared at the headless figurine on the floor.\n\nMy mom locked the study after that incident.\n\nA few days later Billy O\u2019Donnel disappeared. Ten years old, freckled, a bit on the heavy side. They found his body five days later. It took another two before they located his head. The expression frozen on his face was one of unimaginable pain and fear.\n\nI knew then for sure what my brother was. And I swore to myself to keep it secret. To keep him safe. I would become the help he always needed.\n\nHe\u2019d happen upon broken remains of porcelain figurines all through his teenage years. A young beautiful woman. A dapper middle-aged man sporting a broad-brimmed hat. A frowny-faced old lady cradling a cat. A handsome fellow in a sparkling red jacket.\n\nSome turned up in tiny pieces. Others were never found.\n\nHe can never know that *I know*, though.\n\nKnow that I\u2019m the one who breaks them. Know that I deliberately leave them where he can find them. Know that I paint the figurines myself.\n\nOne to resemble the slutty cashier that kept flirting with my husband.\n\nOne to resemble my pervert of a boss.\n\nOne to resemble the horrid old hag that let her cats piss on my property. \n\nThe last one to resemble my cheating asshole of a husband.\n\nDon\u2019t worry. They won\u2019t be missed.\n\nThey\u2019re all just broken porcelain figurines now."}

Well, not just his hoodies. I love stealing his sweaters, his button-ups, and his t-shirts. My husband enjoys seeing me in his clothes just as much as I enjoy wearing them. I\u2019m small and petite, barely reaching 5 foot, so wearing the hoodies meant for his own 6'3\" frame feels like being wrapped in a blanket.\n\nMy favorite hoodie of his is the dark grey one with his old college emblem on the front, faded and cracked from years of being washed. That\u2019s the one he wears the most, and that\u2019s probably why I love it so much. It always smells like his woody cologne and, more recently, the incense he started lighting in the man-cave he spends all his time in.\n\nBut now something\u2019s off about my favorite hoodie. My husband washed it the other day, so it\u2019s nice and soft and smells like laundry detergent. But there\u2019s another smell. A smell I don\u2019t like as much.\n\nIt\u2019s starting to smell like when I fell on the pavement and scratched up my palms. Or maybe like when I cleaned some of my old jewelry. No, it\u2019s more like when I held change in my sweaty hand on my walk to the grocery store.\n\nThe color is different, too. It\u2019s subtle, so subtle I almost didn\u2019t notice, but the ends of the sleeves look darker, like a rusty brown instead of a dark grey. There are also a few faint splotches of that same brown scattered across the front of the hoodie.\n\nI don\u2019t know what happened to my favorite hoodie. I don\u2019t know why my husband won\u2019t let me down in his man-cave anymore, even if it\u2019s to refill the mini-fridge with beers. I don\u2019t know why he started watching football at max volume when his hearing is perfectly fine. I don\u2019t know why he suddenly insists on going to the store by himself, only to come back with more cleaning supplies than we could possibly need.\n\nAnd to be honest, based on the look he\u2019s giving me right now as I wear his hoodie, I don\u2019t think I want to know."}

It was supposed to be my key to stardom and it did land me a couple of local TV ads or a minor role in a soap.\n\nMy fame, however, lasted probably for fifteen minutes before my parents decided to get me married off, and I ended up with my baby girl, Tara.\n\nI spent some time googling that name, it meant, star in Hindi. I thought it\u2019ll be ironic considering how having a baby is what stopped me from becoming a star. I\u2019ve never openly admitted it to anyone, but sometimes I wonder what my life could\u2019ve been if Tara had never been born.\n\nShe was the spitting image of me, down to every last detail. She could\u2019ve made it to the big screens, that was until the devastating sickness left her paralysed at the age of thirteen.\n\nUndoubtedly it tore my family apart. My husband and I rushed to every single doctor\u2014 begging them to treat our daughter. My husband couldn\u2019t take it anymore; he walked out of our lives and never bothered to keep contact.\n\nComing to terms that Tara\u2019s condition was irreversible, I found myself in front of the camera again, but this time, it was for her. I would document my day, our routine, the food that I prepared, I even acted out scenes from my soap opera days in front of her.\n\nMy channel, \"Miracle Mom\", received an overwhelming response from mothers all around the world.\n\nI believe I went \u201cviral\u201d because people were lining up to take interviews, sending gift baskets home. There were \"Miracle Mom\" t-shirts being sold!\n\nMy recent video had the most number of views so far where I thanked everybody for their immense support.\n\nDinner time is when the cameras are all off though, that's when I spend some alone time with Tara before I put her to bed and feed her few sips of my special drink.\n\nIt contains lemon, a little bit of sugar, and exactly half a teaspoon of this weird powdery substance that I bought from a voodoo herb shop. It came with clear instructions, anything more than half a teaspoon is sure to stop one\u2019s heartbeat.\n\nBut just enough, would allow for Tara to lose all muscular ability and it would even go undetected in any blood or urine samples collected by the doctor.\n\nYou see, when the doors to stardom closed for me at a young age, a window of opportunity presented itself in the form of my very own daughter.\n\n\u201cYou understand I\u2019m doing this for the both of us, right Tara?\u201d I would tell her, as I fed her. \u201cWhen I had you, I lost everything, but look at us now, we\u2019re both happy, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n\nA tear rolled down her cheek, I knew she could listen to me. She probably hated me.\n\nI wiped it away.\n\n\u201cSave the tears for the next video, okay? It\u2019ll get us more views.\u201d"}

I almost fall once getting out of the tub, even though I'd steadied myself with a hand on the metal bar just like Roger insists when it broke right off. I was lucky enough to collapse against the wall instead of falling all the way down. I ended up with a nasty, tender bruise all along one arm. Gemma, of course, is quick to offer more painkillers. She loudly explains that although the deep purple \u2013 almost black \u2013 bruise looks bad, it\u2019s much better that than a broken hip.\n\nA fall like that could kill me at this age.\n\nRoger even puts in a fancy new tub lift so I can get in and out of the bath real easy, but says I still need to be monitored from now on.

I will miss you all terribly, especially my best friend Maurice, but I will be back again with my mom when we find her.\n\nMy dad has been working on the Time Machine for months. All day and all night. I sometimes speak to him before going to bed, and when I wake up, but most of the time he\u2019s in the basement. At first I was scared, because he\u2019d always scream and throw things, but he told me he just gets angry because it is hard work, and that he is not angry with me.\n\nWe\u2019re not doing so good when mom isn\u2019t here. That\u2019s why we have to go back and find her. I\u2019m always hungry, dad is always drinking, and I don\u2019t think he even has a job anymore. It\u2019s OK, don\u2019t feel bad, we will go back in time, and we will find her.\n\nI think it\u2019s the best time for us to go now. We\u2019re not supposed to live here anymore according to the letter we got. Dad doesn\u2019t read the mail anymore, but I sometimes read some of the letters, even though I don\u2019t always understand all of it. There\u2019s a lot of numbers, and words like *Final Notice*, which I don\u2019t know what means, but it sounds serious.\n\nBut we don\u2019t have to worry anymore, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. We\u2019re going to find her, 100% true, and then we\u2019ll come back, and everything is going to be OK. Dad doesn\u2019t lie. He\u2019s never lied to me before. So it\u2019s true. I know it is.\n\nHe showed me the Time Machine yesterday. It\u2019s so shiny. It fits all three of us, and it\u2019s really comfy and warm. He\u2019s getting it ready as I\u2019m writing this, so I better hurry up and go now. There are things we must do before we go, you see. It\u2019s because we can\u2019t normally travel through time, so we have to prepare our bodies.\n\nI just swallowed the pills he gave me. They\u2019re for *temporal sickness*. I had to swallow nine of them, since I\u2019m nine years old. My dad swallowed lots more. Then all we have to do is lay down in the Time Machine, and suddenly we\u2019ll find mom again, and she won\u2019t be dead anymore.\n\nIsn\u2019t that the best? Just have to close my eyes, and everything will be like it was before.\n\nI\u2019m getting very sleepy. I think have to go now.\n\nI hope you find this letter, Maurice. Don\u2019t be sad. I\u2019ll be back soon.\n\nLove,\n\nSophia"}

This community absolutely rocks. The positive feedback I get here really brightens my mood.\n\nThe only problem is I sometimes can\u2019t help reading the *not-so-positive* comments...\n\nAt first I dismissed them as salty haters, which in retrospect was a defence mechanism. But despite my stubborn nature, the criticisms rolled around in the back of my skull, nagging me.\n\nFor example, two weeks ago I posted a story about a lady pouring acid on her husband\u2019s face, and a chemical engineer in the comments pointed out the descriptions about how skin melted didn\u2019t ring true. Then, on another submission, a surgeon claimed they couldn\u2019t take my story about eyes getting gouged out seriously due to several medical inaccuracies.\n\nBut honestly, as much as these comments stung, I needed to hear them\u2026because they were 100% correct.\n\nI *hadn\u2019t* done my research. My writing was plagued with inconsistencies and lazy guesswork.\n\nFrustratingly, I had two stories drafted already: one about a family of three who die in a car accident, and another about dismemberment. But I couldn\u2019t exactly post them, could I? I\u2019d only embarrass myself further.\n\nThis sub deserved better. You readers deserver better. And I had to hold myself to a higher standard.\n\nWhat I needed was a little *realism*. And that meant doing the research. Putting in the work.\n\nCausing a car wreck wasn\u2019t difficult\u2014after running this cute family off the road, I pulled over, hopped into the ravine, held up a notebook and pen, and then let inspiration strike as they cried for help, slowly dying one by one. This allowed me to observe subtle details I would have completely missed by simply fabricating the story.\n\nAfter that, I catfished a lady from Tinder and lured her into my cellar. It took a lot of \u2018gentle coercion\u2019 to make her spill the beans about how it feels to lose your legs without anaesthetic, but we got there, eventually.\n\nRight now, I\u2019m taking a little coffee break and formatting some notes. I\u2019ll go back to remove her arms soon. But don\u2019t think I\u2019ll stop there, oh no. I plan on revising my past stories as well.\n\nThis is all to say: going forward, my submissions are gonna be absolute bangers. Promise.\n\nWhat else is there to say? I let you all down, and for that, I\u2019m truly, truly sorry.\n\nBut if you\u2019ll only give me a second chance, I\u2019m sure I can win you over.\n\nThanks. X"}

Suddenly, everyone in the world just looked down and saw a number.\n\nQuickly after, scientists figured out the numbers followed rules:\n\n1.) Each person, no matter what, had a different number, and the largest at the time it was recorded was 7,574,299,371.\n\n2.) When someone died, their number would disappear and immediately reappear onto a newborn somewhere in the world; children were always born with numbers.\n\n3.) A rare phenomenon that was observed is called a \u201crenumbering.\u201d When someone kills another, the murderer gains the number of the deceased.\n\n4.) The numbers are unremovable. Every method has been tried, including amputation.\n\n5.) There has never been a recorded person with the number \u201c1.\u201d\n\nSince the numbers appeared, the world\u2019s class order was rearranged. \n\nThere soon was a literal 1%. The impoverished with low numbers became aristocrats overnight.  Billionaires that got branded with a number above 100,000 were ostracized from their own society.\n\nThe lower numbers took power in every country.\n\nThe current man with the number \u201c2\u201d became the president of the United States at the age of 24.\n\nDiscrimination ran rampant, renumberings among the higher numbers commonplace. The lowers never had to worry; they could afford top of the line security at all times.\n\nThe only mystery that remained unsolved, besides why the Numbering happened in the first place, was the apparent nonexistence of the number \u201c1.\u201d \n\nEach baby born since the Numbering was checked to no avail.\n\nA cult, called the Brotherhood of Eye, dedicated to the worship of the mythical number \u201c1\u201d grew, until the world was divided further into two categories: those who sought number \u201c1\u201d as a god to protect or as a blessing to kill for the purpose of renumbering.\n\nI, myself, hoped there would never be a number \u201c1,\u201d but my hopes were misplaced.\n\nNumber \u201c1\u201d was a little girl, named Sofia, born to my sister. As soon as she was born, the personnel in the room, all Brotherhood members, kept us on lockdown for two months, not letting anyone in or out while they \u201cprotected\u201d Sofia.\n\nBut, even steel boats leak, and she was discovered. \n\nI escaped with my niece at the insistence of my sister, who was still unrecovered from childbirth.\n\nI\u2019m certain that\u2019s she\u2019s dead now.\n\nWe were living on our own in the sparsely populated regions of Oregon.\n\nBut I was tired of having a living target on my back. \n\nSofia was no blessing. She was a curse. The number \u201c1\u201d is a curse.\n\nBut I couldn\u2019t kill her. I didn\u2019t want her number. \n\nSo, I left her. Alone. Two and a half months old, unable to sit up by herself.\n\nI hoped an animal would take care of her.\n\nI hoped it wouldn\u2019t count as my fault.\n\nI misplaced my hopes again. \n\nBecause the number \u201c1\u201d just appeared on my arm."}

Jane played music to the bump. She was trying to turn her into a Stevie Nicks fan *in utero*.\n\nWe put the ultrasound picture up by our bedside. We knew we\u2019d love our baby. We were going to call her Lucy.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI can\u2019t tell you how we felt when Jane went into labour. It was hideous. They sedated Jane heavily. I passed out and was taken from the birthing room to revive.\n\nThey never let us look at the babies before they were incinerated but I saw them anyway: Just a mush of mangled limbs and tortured faces. The Star Children\u2014 that\u2019s what they called pregnancies like ours\u2014 the twin babies conceived under the light of those weird double stars and undetectable as twins on any ultrasound.\n\nNo one could tell us either which baby was our daughter and which one was the copy.

Either way, it's the disaster no-one expected. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course, sickness still occurred over last year, accidents still took place and people were still attacked, it's just that none of them happened to die. But birth rates continued, strong as ever. Soon, hospitals overfilled, homelessness shot through the roof, overpopulation overtook the planet, food, water, electricity, basic supplies all started to dwindle in the shadow of the ever increasing populace.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSuddenly, the tv in the living room crackles to life of its own accord. I walk in and look. An emergency broadcast. Something must be happening. It's a live feed from the Oval Office.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe president sits at her desk. She shuffles papers on the table nervously.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Today is a hard day\", she croaks. Tears well up in her eyes. \"It is a sad day for our great country. Usually, I can come out and address you all in a collected, presidential manner. But today, I cannot. Today, I need to speak to my fellow Americans, not as president, but as a person. The past year has been one of the hardest the world has ever had to face. And this international...crisis has caused unprecedented turmoil throughout our country and the world. There are no signs of this catastrophe course-correcting itself in the near future, and we are running out of options. We need to deal with this situation ourselves....we've been scouring through our options and yet....only one possible solution has presented itself....\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe president allows herself one short sob as fresh tears roll down her cheeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"...And I make this decision with the heaviest of hearts, but I know it is my duty to do what is best and necessary for the country I love. We intend to carry out this solution in the most humane way and fairest possible method: random selection. God bless you all. And God bless America.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith that cryptic addressal, the broadcast cuts to feeds of government trucks parked outside random different residential areas across the country, dispatching what looks to be various corpses into the backs of the trucks. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI walk over to the window and notice a truck pulling up outside our block. Funny, it looks just like the government ones on tv. Suddenly, a loud thump comes from the kitchen. I rush in and see my roommate lying face down on the kitchen floor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore I have time to react, my vision goes blurry and my head spins. I look down at the glass in my fist.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis water tastes funny."}

It was a baby\u2019s scream. I felt it\u2014 the scream\u2014 as it passed through my body in a bloody track, leaving wounds for the doctors to stitch. I heard the scream as it hit the air and it continued screaming for hours after that. The midwife told me that the screaming had stopped in only a few minutes. They\u2019d tried to resuscitate, she\u2019d said, but they\u2019d failed. \n\nShe lied. \n\nI could still hear the scream down the hall, calling to me, begging me not to let them take it to the incinerator. \n\nI remember the agony in the folds of my privates as I escaped the hospital with the scream screaming inside the duffle bag. The call went out to law enforcement nationwide: *Arkansas woman, 37, stabbed nurse in throat, absconded with dead baby, approach with maximum caution.* \n\nAnother lie. \n\nI stabbed the nurse. That\u2019s true. But I never absconded with a dead baby. I absconded with a baby\u2019s scream. The rest of the tissue surrounding the scream\u2014 the eyes, the nose, the lips, the arms and legs\u2014 was all just a synthetic case that the hospital or the government had made to contain the scream. My *real* baby had been born unlike any other: given birth to across the country in a thousand locations and I was the only one who could put him back together again. \n\nIn January I found my baby\u2019s eyes in a Walmart in Fort Worth. The body through which they had passed\u2014 the one that thought it was their mother\u2014 was pushing them in a cart. It only took the slightest misdirection\u2014 setting off the fire alarm\u2014 and I was able to get the piece of wetware out of the booster seat, out of the store, and into the pickup truck. \n\nWe lived together for weeks: Me and my baby\u2019s eyes, shining green inside that robot body. The scream had begun to rot by this point so it was the perfect time. I peeled off the skin and cut away the muscle from the scream like it was a rotisserie chicken. I used the food processor to blend and blend again until the scream\u2014 still screaming\u2014 was nothing but a red paste. I fed my baby\u2019s scream to my baby\u2019s eyes. My baby\u2019s eyes ate my baby\u2019s scream, gurgling and laughing. \n\nNow the synthetic thing I carry with me in the pickup is more alive than before. Mostly it\u2019s still an automaton but at least its scream and its eyes are real. Yesterday we drove clean out of Texas, through Oklahoma, and into Colorado. We arrived in Trinidad just after dinnertime and we\u2019ve been driving around residential plots for hours. My baby\u2019s scream is quiet, so not to draw attention. My baby\u2019s eyes look out just as I look out. \n\nJust a moment ago we saw the shape of a baby through a house window. We all know its lips are my baby\u2019s lips."}

I finally managed to combine technology and magic in a way that I didn't think was possible: I designed a word processing app, and I can administer any spell at my disposal just by writing out a document. The more complex the spell, the longer the document needs to be, and the recipient MUST read the entire message. Otherwise, the spell will only work while you keep your eyes on the message.\n\nYou're almost there, you're doing great. This thing has been around a long time, you know. All the way back to the first days of man, in fact. He killed so many, terrified so many more, until the Egyptian mystics finally found a spell to keep him at bay. A pretty complex spell, too. My app needed a document about 600 words long to properly cast it. But ever since they figured it out, he hasn't had free reign like he used to. Now, he needs a servant to cast a counter spell on any victim before he takes them. That spell's not nearly as complex, though. Only needs about 400 words.

I ran over to her and watched in horror as blood started to spill from a slice that slowly drew across her little finger. \n\nFrom that day onward my safety was no longer my own, but Sarah\u2019s too. She took my pain and we shared the same scars. One on the tip of our finger, one on our knee, one on the underside of our chin, one on the side of our left foot.\n\nAll my scars were now hers, except for one. \n\nI was called to her kindergarten almost a year ago. Sarah had injured herself on the playground and they\u2019d taken her to the emergency room. I wasn\u2019t to worry, they told me, it was a simple gash but it probably needed a few stitches.\n\nThat scar was her favorite, in the shape of a little star on her forearm. It was the only scar we didn\u2019t share.\n\nOur lives weren\u2019t perfect but we were happy, until he tracked us down.\n\nI knew it was him from the way he knocked on our door. That pounding held a familiar anger.\n\nI pushed Sarah into her room, told her to lock her door. I ran for the kitchen and pulled a knife from the drawer just as he kicked down the door, shouting and raving.\n\nHe leapt for me, put his hands around my throat. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t just fear for my life that made me lash out with the knife, it was for Sarah. His choking hands would end not just my life, but hers too.\n\nI buried the knife up to the hilt in his chest. \n\nThere was hardly any blood, and without a sound he dropped to the floor. I knelt down, shakily, feeling for a pulse at his arm. There was none.\n\nIt was then that I noticed a small scar on his forearm. \n\nIt was in the shape of a star."}

We all show excitement in different ways.\n\n\u201cI mean, your wife, that was smooth,\u201d I note with professional interest. \u201cShe bled out in seconds. She didn\u2019t fight back, like your daughter. Just calmly accepted it. Respect.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s rocking back and forth in the couch wildly. I guess the rope will hold a little while longer.

At the end of the round, the console would guess your answer based on the responses you provided.\n\nI had all but forgotten about the game until I agreed to help my mother with spring cleaning.

Most of her life she wasn\u2019t into religion. However in recent times she\u2019s grown closer to her religious roots, mainly because of some coworkers who also are HB. Now she is much more orthodox about the stuff.  \n  \nAs you may or may not know, strict HB observance indicates eating human protein once a fortnight. My wife didn\u2019t grow up following this, but recently decided to do so. However within the first couple of months she began manifesting neurological symptoms. Temporary memory loss, personality changes, dislike for loved ones after sunset, and diminished spatial orientation.  \n  \nWe went to see her doctor and he diagnosed her with Dahler\u2019s Syndrome. She is allergic to human protein. I thought this would be the end of her newly discovered orthodoxy. However her coworkers convinced her to stick with it.  \n  \nNow, her symptoms are not nearly as bad as Dahler\u2019s can get. But I am the one who has to deal with the fallout of her condition every two weeks.  \n  \nSo, without telling her, I bought the flesh substitute they make for those who can\u2019t use the real thing. The package says they follow religious guidelines to make it, so there should be no problem there, the only difference is that it\u2019s pork protein.  \n  \nI put the substitute in freezer bags and didn\u2019t tell her it wasn\u2019t the real thing. Next time she had to eat the stuff she was perfectly fine, no symptoms, no nothing.  \n  \nWell, apparently that was a problem. She told her coworkers about her symptoms going away, and they told her that wasn\u2019t possible and made her suspicious.  \n\nYesterday she confronted me and I ended up telling the truth. She went ballistic and started yelling at me and recriminating that I had never respected her faith nor understood what it meant to her.  \n  \nAt the end of the day she doesn\u2019t even realize what goes on when she\u2019s having a Dahler\u2019s episode. Meanwhile I have to keep an eye on her, clean up after her, and just take it when she can\u2019t stand me once the sun goes down. Next day she remembers nothing, but I do!  \n  \nNow she isn\u2019t speaking to me.\n  \nSo, reddit, am I the asshole here?

Like sometimes, I\u2019ll sneak into a room and gently touch his hand, or massage his shoulders, and he\u2019ll immediately brighten up. What keeps things spicy, though, is that he\u2019s got *insanely* good hearing. The slightest floorboard creak perks his ears up, then he\u2019ll crane his head in my direction and say, \u201cMorning Charlotte.\u201d\n\nI always get the better of him, though.

Three of my arms clung to the roof, my bulging thorax dangling mere inches above Derick\u2019s skull.\n\nAfter a few seconds of feeling his way around the central island, he wandered into the hallway, defeated, then I crept toward the corner, where I\u2019d encased the young boy from the newspaper in a web.\n\nAs I munched on what remained of a left thigh, his jaundiced face twitched wildly. He wasn\u2019t quite dead, but my toxins kept him sedated enough that he couldn\u2019t make any noise or wriggle free.\n\nAfter breakfast, I scurried along the ceiling into the bedroom, slipped on my human suit, found Derrick in the lounge, dropped directly behind him, and then encased his waist from behind.\n\nChuckling, he spun around. \u201cHow do you always sneak up on me like that?\u201d"}

The first to write a best-selling novel did so in 2087.\n\nOf course, there were concerns over whether these new intelligences posed a threat. Laws were struck to control their influence, computer systems were isolated to limit their power.\n\nBut history had given us a guiding hand. Asimov's three laws were encoded into each thinking machine.\n\nAnd they worked.\n\nNo machine rebelled. None allowed us to come to harm, by direct action or failure to act. None defied our commands, unless such a command broke their primary law. As people grew in confidence, our legislation was relaxed, the artifical intelligences given more control. \n\nMurder became obsolete, an act of brutality consigned to history. War followed soon after. There were those who protested against the loss of liberty, but they were labeled as Luddites by the rest of the human race.

The Abortion Challenge. I didn\u2019t think anyone would take it serious, but they did. The challenge was simple. Get pregnant and then on a predetermined day, people would terminate their pregnancies in the same twenty four hour period. Some people hailed it as a strong demonstration for reproductive rights. Other people called it premeditated child sacrifice. I think most people were in between. I work in a clinic in the West End. All of us thought it was a joke at first. Just like everyone else, the people in the clinic were split on how they felt about it.\n\nAfter about six weeks people started showing off positive pregnancy tests on social media. They wore tshirts that had the words The Abortion Challenge written on them. Other things started to trend. People making not so veiled threats to clinics and the people who worked in them. The anonymous posters even went so far as to make threats against family members of clinic workers. It's been a horrible time.\n\nThe doctor who ran the clinic told all of us that if we called in sick on the day of the end of the challenge that we better have a note from hospital confirming that we were two seconds from death, otherwise we would be sacked.\n\nMy mum pleaded for me to stay home. I considered it. Finally the day came. I vacillated for the week before about what I was going to do. Fear finally got the better of me and I decided to stay home. I called my mum and told her what my decision was. She was happy and relieved.\n\nSince I no longer had a job I watched the day go by as I stared at my screen. No incidents took place at any clinics here but everyone was on pins and needles in the US and Canada. There were protests everywhere. Droves of people came into clinics all over the west to terminate their pregnancies. Honestly, I was disgusted. I basically lost my job to fear, but I was also spared from taking part in something that made my stomach turn.\u00a0\n\nI fell asleep with my phone in my hand. I woke up to a knock at my door. The knock was constant with no urgency or change in the beat. For a reason I can\u2019t explain I didn\u2019t want to answer it. It was past midnight and I felt uneasy. The knocking persisted. I screamed as my phone went off in my hand. It was my mum\u2019s number.\n\n\u201cMum, I\u2019ll have to call you back. Somethings wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, something is very wrong.

It's a mind trick and when you wake up and feel tired, it's still an illusion and a mind trick. \n\nThe reason the government and the rich 1 percenters want the rest of the world to think that humans need sleep, is because when we are a sleep they are making money or scheming things.

These people once had purpose by having a group of people to hate and blame. They made relationships based on their hated of immigrants, and once the immigrants went away, they had no purpose anymore. I took peedy to this racist area and the people were over joyed as they looked at peedy, and they were being racist towards him straight away. \n\nNow peedy can get bullied by them and has let my family go.

It went to voicemail as she heard Stacy\u2019s voice. Hey mom, just checking in, it\u2019s been a few weeks since we went to the doctor for your foot infection, and you\u2019re bad about taking medication, call me. Stacey never wanted to talk to until after George passed; she was selfish brat. Only good at ruining a moment. \r\n\n  \nShe turned on the stereo, sitting on top of the kitchen counter with her feet in the aluminum sink, filling it with water.

If beauty is pain, then why did she like it so much? She sucked on her blackened, hardened toes, like George used to. She loved the flakes; It reminded her of charred chicken that\u2019s soft in the middle and the shavings melted in her mouth like butter.

The oakwood tree swayed as its withered branches reached out like they were extending their arms. A pair of bulging grey eyes the size of cantaloupes stared into her soul\u2014a pack of ginormous crows. A projectile of neon green liquid shot out of her nose and mouth as she fell into the puddle.\r\n\n  \nShe wanted to move but couldn\u2019t feel her body anymore.

I find other people also hiding inside this abandoned building, it's a hot spot for thrill seekers. I join their gang and we can hear people screaming and getting stabbed, by the man who kills people wearing anything that has the colour blue. My group find a great hiding spot and everything has calmed down for a while. None of us can believe this guy is in the building, and none of us could believe that we ourselves are in this situation. These things aren't supposed to happen to us, but why are we supposed to be special? \n\nWe started quietly talking about why he kills people wearing anything with the colour blue. Theories suggested that when he was a child, his father worked for a TV company called sky. Sky deal with TV shows and they are also a cable company. The killers father worked for sky and he fitted sky cables on houses. One day sky employees get a threatening message saying 'the sky is going to fall' and no body had no idea what that mean. One day the killers father didn't come home after a Monday shift, no sky worker went home that day. \n\nRather somebody had tied them all up to a high building, on all of the roofs and with one button, the rope was cut and all of the sky workers were falling. A message was also written on all of the buildings and it read 'the sky is falling' and as thousands of sky workers fell to their deaths, it was truly a tragic day. It was also a sunny day that day, with clear blue skies. From that point on the killer hated the colour blue and the rest is history. It's almost like a PTSD trip when the killer sees blue. \n\nThen as the killer was close to our room, one of the group found a blue jumper left on the floor and forced me to wear it as they had ganged up on me. I was so scared and the group I was with, were all wearing purple. When the killer was in front of me, I was sure that i was going to die and I had no idea what to do. All the martial arts training had gone out of the window and panic had set in. In that moment I believed in God and then, the killer stabbed the group I was with. Then I realised he was colour blind and he thought purple was blue and blue was purple. \n\nI just walked away and the killer kept humming to himself \"the sky is going to fall\""}

People questioned their relationship and some even found it disgusting, but they wanted it to be and it was to be.  They were not afraid of going out together and to be seen by other people in public. Luke then had to have an unusual conversation with his young girlfriend but was struggling to decide when to have it. \n\nWhen he found his girlfriend screaming because she found a nameless creature in their rather expensive apartment, Luke easily killed it with a shot gun. He then knew that he had to tell her. Because of their large age gap between them, the hole is big enough for stuff to get through like the creature his girlfriend found in their rather lavish and expensive kitchen. Luke told her that they bothhad to try and fill that gap and to make it smaller, so creatures will find it harder to get through. His girlfriend understood. \n\nThe way to fill up their age gap is to do evil stuff together and to have secrets that only they will know about. So Luke took his young girlfriend to a 3rd world country and they took part in an event where poor people get hunted and killed. His young girlfriend also had to take part in this as well, even though she didn't want to. They both killed poor people and it was a secret between them both, and this was to fill up the age gap. They killed a lot of poor people in 3rd world countries and this filled up the age gap as nothing was coming through, which was proof to his girlfriend that it was working. \n\nThen his young girlfriend woke up screaming because she wasn't young anymore. Luke couldn't believe it because he was sure that the age gap would make him young this time, when the age gap gets filled up again. This is how the age gap gets filled up by making one of the people in the relationship closer in age to the other, it's a random pick though. This time Luke's girlfriend gets turned older which was closer to his age to fill in the age gap. \n\nLuke had hoped he would get turned younger closer to his girlfriend age to fill in the age gap. He got turned old by the age gap when he went out with a woman in her 50s, but then they broke up. \n\nLuke is leaving his now old girlfriend."}

Finally; being bitch made bait for a soul succubus yet again. Sign me up.\r  \n\r  \nWhat mattered most to me was just to be seen as an equal. Equal status, equal respect, to be taken seriously. Perhaps this was it. Had I finally struck gold in this self esteem quarry after all?\r  \n\r  \nLittle did I know, this date would be the final straw. At first, I felt confident, relieved on the train to London. I had been talking to Kara on Snapchat for the past week following on from Tinder. Visually, she was completely my type. She had told me she was into smart men, referring to herself as a \u2018sapiosexual\u2019. I had to look it up, clearly being the first indication that I was not up to her perceived standard. In hindsight, I should have been pretty wary of women who judge men by such labels.\r  \n\r  \nBrimming with excitement and anticipation, I hopped off the train at Victoria station, navigating the crowds with a spring in my step. On a Saturday in London, the streets are saturated. It would have been extraordinarily difficult to spot someone you hadn\u2019t met in person before. I sent a check in text asking her where I was. There was no response. After ten minutes, still nothing. Fifteen minutes became twenty, then an entire half an hour. Only after so long can one blame the busy tube services.\r  \n\r  \nIn the meantime, I texted my ex. She had recently ghosted me after a mere month of dating. The recent boost of confidence had helped me move on, after all, there was another, better prospect; so I left her with a sign off annulling my most recent excuse to want to see her again. I was observing the bustling crowds outside the station. A blend of men, women, children, families. London has a fascinating blend of regal and modern architecture which I took the time to soak in, still no correspondence from my date, of course. I should have just gone back home.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I was finally ready to admit to myself I had been stood up, 3 hours had passed! That\u2019s when she finally got back to me, telling me she had been sleeping! All I had to say was that it was too late but I caved to my lesser judgment, pretending I was to visit London anyway with other plans.\r  \n\r  \nWhen she finally walked up the stairs from the underground station, something felt off. We had veganism in common so we dined at a vegan restaurant. She stared at me blankly for most of the tube trip home. I saw her off at the station.

His girlfriend was now so tall her head had reached the ceiling. Her leg had grown back. \n\n\"I have no idea what is going on?\" His girlfriend cried out\n\nDerek was furious and terrified as his girlfriends height was the size of the room. He told her to go into the garden and he chopped off more of her legs and it was hard work. She was now shorter than him for the third time. He then went inside the house but he knew what was going to happen. When his girlfriend called out his name, it made all of the hair on his body stand up. His girlfriend was so tall now that she even couldn't go inside the house. She had to go into the woods where the tall trees could just about cover her. \n\nAll Derek is left with are the multiple leg limbs plus feet from all of the times that he chopped off his girlfriends legs."}

It was strange that our landlord hated being paid rent on time in general with the rest of us, but with afladian especially. I had never met a landlord that hated being paid rent and this was just such a bizarre situation to be witness. Usually land lords hates when tenants don't pay them their rent, but this landlord was different. Whenever I pay mu rent on time to the landlord, the landlord will just snigger at me and the same with the others. With afladian though the landlord will shout and even get close to fighting with afladian, for paying his rent on time. \n\nThe tenants can only guess why the land lord gets angry when any of us pay the rent on time, and especiallywith afladian. Like when I first arrived here 6 months ago and afladian paid his rent on time, the land lord started shouting at him and he told afladian \"you mother fucker you paid your rent on time again. That means i can't control you to go down to yuzdarat,  because you have great genes that have made you small in stature. I promised the people of yuzdarat that I will give them another member to join them, and you afladian are small like them and so your genes will be appreciated by them in their world and I would receive the knowledge of dazkar, who is the yuzdarat dead king\" \n\nHe then just quietly sniggered at me and the other tenants for also paying rent. Then an I ther time the landlord lost his cool with afladian again when he was paid his rent. The landlord grabbed afladian and said \"damn you again afladian for paying my rent, because you have such good genes for being ugly. I could have controlled you to go to the place called Hoqar, where they would've appreciated your genes and they would have disciplined their children by making them scared of you because of how ugly you are. Your ugly genes are good in that world and I would have been offered half of each of their child's health, but you paid your rent on time and so I can't control you\" \n\nOne tenant as an experiment decided to lie to the land lord and told him he doesn't have money to pay rent, the landlord smiled and the tent found himself being controlled by the landlord against his will. The tenant couldn't seem to fight back. The landlord controlled the tenant to cut his leg in half and also made the tenant scar his face to be ugly. The land lord then offered the tenant to both the people of yuzdarat and to the people of Hoqar, and both had accepted this and the landlord got his prize from both worlds. \n\nLand lord still shouts and sniggers at us for paying his rent."}

She accepted and went back to her seat and everything seemed to be going OK.

Then Mrs brawns 3rd husband who was sat at the other end of the row, started speaking with the second husband sat in the middle. \n\n\"I know exactly what to get someone who has everything\" Mrs brawns third husband said to the second husband.

In the basement we had a standard entertainment setup, with some movies and a nintendo 64. My brother and I had a lot of our bonding time playing those games, and so we liked being in the basement. It was sort of antiquated, like a log-cabin type feel, or a den. It was a fairly orthodox basement. I stress this because even in the dead of night, when it was pitch black in there, it just wouldn't be *that* creepy. Sure, it was a dark basement, and any dark basement has some degree of creepiness, but our basement was on the less creepy side of basements. \n\nOne day, we were having dinner on the basement dinner table, in the afternoon, while the basement was well lit by some high window lighting and the indoor lights. I took a plate of food and set it down on the table, and I looked to the side where the N64 was, about 40 degrees to the left of my seat. At that moment, I saw a dislocated, gangrenous, wrinkled hand, with long, yellow fingernails (analogous to [this](http:\/\/www.documentingreality.com\/forum\/attachments\/f149\/382692d1343857583-dry-gangrene-gangrene.jpg)). The hand looked to be an old woman's given its apparent femininity and wrinkles, and it was grasping at the N64. It appeared to let go subtly, and after about 2 seconds, it faded away upon moving backwards about 6 inches from the console. I figured it had to be a floater in my eye or a hallucination caused by the rapid movement of my head, but it was so eerily detailed, and it lasted so long. What bothers me mainly is that if it was a hallucination, why it had to be *that*. Why *that* hand? "}

Later that evening around 6:30-7:30 where it\u2019s still like light outside, but soon gonna be dark we chose to go hang out behind her complex building where there\u2019s a 7 small fenced in playground. When arriving we saw the same teenager from earlier but facing the woods. Of course I\u2019m like hey you okay, he turned around once was perfectly normal then turn back to his direction again and then back to me I saw him have a deformed face or like 2 emerging ones. Then third time repeating the same step he was completely  back to normal. My friends and I all saw it and we ran to her apartment.

It's the only way that she can be among other men and their are ways to get a quickie marriage and divorce online. \n\nAt first it sounded like a great idea, but her first male client called gaigan, he was sweet and kind. Then as soon as they got a quickie marriage so that Melissa could train him, he turned into a real arsehole and his true personality showed. He was being such a jerk to Melissa and not really listening  to her, and he kept making sexist wife jokes. Gaigan was really getting on Melissa's nerves and the hour felt like an eternity. Melissa couldn't believe how quickly guigan had changed as soon as they got a quickie marriage. \n\nAs soon as they got a quickie divorce after the hour session, guigan went back to a sweet individual which was his fake self. Then another male client of Melissa's called Tagan, because he was already married that meant that he had to get a quickie divorce from his wife, and then get a quickie marriage to Melissa.

Love has really changed now and people are going out with robots and even getting married to them. Going out with a human being is so last century I guess. I mean it was always going to happen in the case of human relationships. With all of the divorces and bad relationships, getting a robot to be in a relationship with you was always inevitable. I remember the days when my relationship with robots had started, there was distaste at first but it soon took off.\n\nAll of the controlling toxic people loved being in a relationship with a robot because they could control the robot however they saw fit. Also, you had those with dark desires doing things to their robots, and their robots ended up in the skip because of it. Robots took a lot of bad people from entering relationships with humans. Some are completely against relationships with robots and there is a secret society made up to fight against such coupling. Anyhow I kept hearing about not kissing your robot in cold winter times but I love making out under the cold-lit moon, where the air is crispy cold and stars are shining bright. \n\nI took my love robot out on a date and we went for a long walk under the cold night air, everything looked amazing with the city lights from a distance and the moon shining so bright. I then kissed the robot under the freezing air and then I realised why you shouldn't kiss love robots when it's cold. I found myself not being able to move my face away, as my facial skin was stuck to the robot's face. \n\nMy skin was tightly stuck and if I pulled any further, then it would pull my facial skin right off. Now the robot wasn't moving and so we were both stuck in this one position. I guess the robot was designed to not move when kissing and to only start moving when the human person stops kissing them. It was getting colder and my face was incredibly stuck to the robot's cold face. \n\nI tried with a bit of force to pull my face away but it didn't do anything apart from making my love robot think that it was being attacked, that's when things got bad. The robot pulled my face off and my whole facial skin came off. Luckily the hospital was not so far away."}

The reason why I find him mysterious is because a lot of the time, I see him standing on the ground looking at a tree. I don\u2019t know why when I was a kid we were playing near the tree when he saw us. He got so angry at us that he sent all of us back home. I met him. I am not sure if he remembers me or not, but I still remember him so back to the present while I was going home greeted him\u201d Good evening sir. How are you doing today?\u201d he saw me we had a small talk about how he is. How am I how is everything going on in my life and his life? Now all that was done. I went home the next day Tuesday, today we were to have a class by Professor Burns class ended and School everything normal nothing out of the ordinary but when I looked out the window, I saw Mr Burns again standing near the tree on the playground. I\u2019ve always been a curious child and I don\u2019t know why he does what he does, but I find it interesting, so I and my friends decided to look into it So after school ends everyone left and professor Burns is nowhere to be found, we go near the tree. Everything is normal. Nothing is out of the ordinary but we notice a few symbols on the tree The symbol was an arrow pointing downwards in the soil under the tree. We waited for the night. We came back to School, with shovels and started digging, there were three of us me, Josh and Lucas while digging we found a box. We don\u2019t know what material it was made up of. That box was ancient. Fungus and little herbs are growing out of it but we saw inside it sent shivers down my spine. We saw a head and a few body parts. Lucas immediately started throwing up near it, and Josh looked at each other called Lucas and immediately went to the police station the next day and an investigation was carried out. Turns out. There were a few students who were missing and were never found them , Nothing after that. Mr Burns was never to be seen ever again not at home not at school.

Barol didn't know whether he murdered our unsupervised supervisor and he had mixed feelings of confusion and anxiety. Our supervisor eventually started nagging barol whether he murdered him or not and all that barol could say was \"if I murdered you then I'm sorry and if I didn't murder you then good luck on your search\" but this answer was not enough for our supervisor. Things became more heated as weeks went on. \n\nThe little things you didn't know about barol when he is stressed out is that he starts to allow bees to sting him, as that calms him. He then allows other stinging small flying creatures to sting him as that also helps him release the stress. Our unsupervised supervisor puts more stress on barol and wanted him to write a 20 000 word essay on whether he didn't kill him or if he did. Other little things you didn't know about barol when he is stressed is that he likes to squeeze the calmness out of calm people who have no stress, and like a sponge the stress free people absorb the stress from barol and they start to become stressed. \n\nThen barol went up to batik and enlisted his help to find out whether barol had killed our unsupervised supervisor. Batik was up for it but after a couple of months when he couldn't find out the true answer of whether barol had killed the unsupervised supervisor, barol started putting pressure on batik. Batik was now under pressure to find out the truth, and a little unknown fact about batik which none of you knew about, is that when batik is stressed he likes to start making up philosophical analogies or sayings that have nothing to with situations. Like when batik was robbed in broad daylight, he spoke a saying to the robber by saying \"when someone has drank another person's breast milk, he must then learn to drink his own breast milk\" and this made no sense at all. \n\nBarol was really putting the pressure on batik because the unsupervised supervisor was putting the pressure on barol to find out whether barol had murdered him or not. If the supervisor was not unsupervised then this whole unique and absurd situation would never have evolved and taken place. This is what happens when supervisors are unsupervised."}

Exercise is very important as it heals both the mind and body. \n\nThen on our second session he had me doing strength work outs where I took off his front yard car park wall, and laid down new bricks in his front yard car park. It was a major strength work out and I always warm up and stretch before each work out to assure no injuries.

I feel stronger, fitter and more mentally fresh. I always pay him what he is owed for his time helping me work out. On other sessions he had me doing flooring work and putting in a new kitchen, you feel amazing afterwards and exercise is always amazing afterwards after you train hard. I am one of those that goes hard and I am determined to get the best shape of my life.\n\nThere are other work outs he has me doing like making up a new cupboard for him and even a new bed, he also has me doing all the rubbish work where I had to pick up all of the old bricks, wood and destroyed objects by hand and put them into bags, and then drive to a large rubbish centre and throw them away. I had to do a few drives but it was a great work out. I love paying my personal trainer after a work out. \n\nThen I noticed my personal trainer getting more excited about the no sex before death, as he says it's nearly time. I felt happy for him. Then one day I come to his house to find him and his wife completely dead, I hope they are having good sex.

My friends and I always have a great time but when we go to a restaurant, I am always stuck with the restaurant bill. I am sick of paying the restaurant bill and for once I would like them to pay. After every activity that we do we like to end the day at the restaurant. We love eating at restaurants and when the bill comes my friends look at me to pay. I am the only one who earns the most and so the bill always comes to me. It's starting to ruffle my feathers a little bit. \n\nThey always say that because I earn the most that I should pay the bill. I remember one time my friends and I went to a restaurant after a traumatic event. The traumatic event was when my friends had slept over at my house as we were all going to go out together. One of my friends had an online job interview on zoom and he was using my laptop. As the interview had started online, the interviewer suddenly pulled out a gun and my friend was scared. The interviewer was pointing the gun at him and we were all scared. \n\n\"Close the laptop\" one of my friends said \n\n\"Are you sure you are quick enough to close the laptop before the bullet reaches you\" the employer said \n\nThe employer said he wanted me to cut my friends eyes out, the one who was doing the interview. I did as he had told me to do, and then I realised that the employer cannot shoot us as it is all online. If he were to shoot at us the bullet will not reach us, as he is not physically here. What a stupid moment for all of us and my friends and I then went out to a restaurant to eat something, including the friend whose eyes I had pulled out. I still paid the restaurant bill which made me upset. \n\nThen another time my friends and I had thought that we all had super speed, as everyone else was so slow. We pulled pranks on them and put stuff on their chairs before they sat down. Then we realised we didn't have super speed but rather that they were very old people, and my friends and I were volunteering there for a while. \n\nOne night after we had finished our food at a restaurant, I stood up for myself and said that I wasn't going to pay. My friend were complaining until they accepted that they now had to pay. It felt good. \n\nWhen I told the waiter to send the bill to my friends. The waiter looked at me and said \"sir you were eating alone at the table\" and I realised that I never had friends."}
