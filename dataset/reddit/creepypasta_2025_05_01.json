We've been largely hands-off, letting people decide with upvotes and downvotes as opposed to micro-managing.\n\nAdditionally, we didn't want to send users to subreddits owned and run by other teams because - to be honest - we can't vouch for others, and whether or not they would treat users well and allow you guys to post all the things you post here. (In other words, we don't always agree with the strictness or tone of some other subreddits, and didn't want to make you guys go to those, instead.)\n\nTo that end, we've come up with a solution of sorts.\n\nWe started r\/IconPasta long ago, for fandom-related posts about Jeff the Killer, BEN, Ticci Toby, and the rest.\n\nWe started r\/HorrorNarrations as well, for narrators to have a specific place that was \"just for them\" without being drowned out by a thousand other types of posts.\n\nSo, now, we're announcing r\/EyeScream for creepy, disturbing, and just plain \"weird\" images!\n\nAt r\/EyeScream, you can count on us to be just as hands-off, only interfering with posts when they break Reddit ToS or our very light rules. (No Gore, No Porn, etc.)\n\nWe hope you guys have fun being the first users there - this is your opportunity to help build and influence what r\/EyeScream is, and will become, for years to come!"},"2":{"title":"I\u2019m looking for nonhuman Creepypastas","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kbn10s\/im_looking_for_nonhuman_creepypastas\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Apart-Copy-1353","selftext":"I\u2019m make an art book full of monster form all sorts of media (games, movies, books, urban legends, and internet horror) so if anyone has any suggestions for Creepypastas for me to put in it"},"3":{"title":"POV: You Opened the Wrong Door and Something Followed You Back\u2026 [4-Minute Horror Short]","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kbp5ht\/pov_you_opened_the_wrong_door_and_something\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Round_Conference7653","selftext":"This is the most immersive horror short I've ever made \u2014 and it's told entirely in first-person POV.\nIt puts you inside the eyes of a girl who opens a door that was never supposed to be there.\nWhat waits on the other side is not a ghost\u2026 it's something worse.\nSomething that remembers you.\nSomething that copies you.\nAnd something that follows you back.\n\nShot in pure GoPro-style, no third-person views, no safety.

It really helps a lot, and once I hit another milestone I'll do another subscriber meet-up.\n\nToday's episode is going to be a little different than normal, but, before we get to that, I want to pass along some personal news. As you probably know, Mrs Mechanical Mike and I have been having marital troubles, and we've actually decided to split up.\n\nBut it's OK. I'm OK.\n\nI'll still see the kids every other weekend, and this way they won't have to see us fighting.\n\nI just wanted to put that out there because I saw some speculation in the comments, and I really hate gossip, OK? I'd rather be honest with you guys.\n\nAnywho, the second piece of personal news is that I lost my job.

We\u2019re about 60 miles from Atlanta, and about 40 or so miles from the Blue Ridge mountains. \nWe\u2019re pretty far from the big city lights that the residents of Atlanta are akin to; so the workings of my town more closely resemble the workings of towns in Blue Ridge. \nAside from the mountains, we have farms and fields, small little mom and pop stores, and miles upon miles of trees. \nNow I\u2019ve heard and read quite a few stories about cults popping up here and there up in the mountains, but that\u2019s where they stayed. Up in the mountains. I don\u2019t even think there were any religious groups other than Christians before this all occurred. \nHowever, 6 months ago the papers and local facebook groups started proposing the idea that there was definitely cult-like activity showing up in my little town. It started pretty small; farmers would report livestock missing only for it to be found a week later back on the very property it disappeared from. Skinned, drained of blood, and missing all of the vital organs. Almost every time the carcasses would be hung from wires that were pierced through the feet of the poor animals, and tied to tree limbs or fence posts.\nMy Christian town started to shiver. It began getting really crazy when the farmers themselves would come up missing. Not just the farmers either, their entire families would just up and vanish overnight. Their homes would always be found filled with all of their possessions aside from some ransacked dressers, valuables, and family photos. \nIt wasn\u2019t every farm and farmer, though, it was just the farmers who had been experiencing the theft and slaughter of livestock. \nSince it was entire families going missing, our ever-present, albeit, lackluster local police concluded that the occurrences were nothing more than families leaving in search of work elsewhere on account of their livelihood being affected by delinquents. \n\u201cProbably just a couple of kids thinking they\u2019re funny,\u201d were the police chief's exact words. \nHe couldn\u2019t have been more wrong, though, because a mere week after the last report of a family leaving to \u201cfind work elsewhere\u201d the livestock going missing had gone from chickens and roosters to full blown cows and bulls. Everything apart from the wire hangings remained the same as part of the ritual. Skinned cow carcasses started appearing on literal doorsteps, dude. Just dumped at random. \nIt wasn\u2019t long before people began to really worry because I mean who wouldn\u2019t? A dead animal of that size doesn\u2019t just appear on your doorstep, right? \nThat being said, at around this time local law enforcement began taking this matter a whole lot more serious. People were advised to be indoors by dark, farmers were advised to keep their animals safe in their barns, and nightly patrols became more regular. \nI kid you not when I tell you these efforts did nothing. The cult activity may have even ramped up if I\u2019m being honest. I specifically remember one morning I went out to check the mail and my next door neighbor who wasn\u2019t even a farmer was out in his yard explaining something to an officer. He looked pissed, man, he was flailing his hands and rapidly firing his words; I didn\u2019t even wanna interfere I just checked my mailbox and watched from a window until the officer left.\n Once he did I hurried outside to get the details from my neighbor. \u201cHey, hold up a second,\u201d I shouted as he was heading back into his house. He stopped halfway up the steps before turning to look at me with anger still evident on his face.  \u201cWhat was all that about?\u201d I asked him. \u201cOh you mean that useless, good for nothing officer of the law who\u2019s leaving without doing shit? Oh yeah, that\u2019s definitely fucking something, huh?\u201d \n\u201cWell why was he even here in the first place?\u201d I replied. \u201cHe was here because of the fucking mess I found in my backyard this morning. This shit is getting out of fucking hand, let me tell you, and people like that motherfucker could not give a fuck less about it.\u201d I knew he was talking about the cult that I\u2019d been hearing rumors about but I had to ask him anyway. \n\u201cWhat mess? What\u2019s getting out of hand?\u201d \n\u201cThat fucking cult, Daniel, I know you\u2019ve fucking heard about it. They\u2019ve been stealing animals and sacrificing em\u2019 or whatever the fuck it is that they do. All I know is one of the fucking screwballs has made a hell of a God Damn mess in my backyard while I\u2019s sleeping. One lucky son of a bitch, let me tell you, he\u2019s lucky cause if I\u2019d have been awake I\u2019d have sent a message out to each and every one of the crazy motherfuckers.\u201d \n\u201cHoly shit, man\u201d I said. \u201cWhat did he even do? Jesus Christ.\u201d \n\u201cHere, come with me, Daniel, I\u2019ll show you what the fucker did.\u201d \nI hadn\u2019t even answered him yet before he was practically dragging me to his backyard. \nI can\u2019t even describe what I saw when we got there, it was absolutely horrid. Blood and internal fluids were everywhere, flies were swarming the entirety of the backyard and walking through it was like walking through an intestinal minefield. \n\u201cThis is what the fuck they did, Daniel. This is what the fuck they fucking did. Looks pretty fucking bad don\u2019t it? I know it does.\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t even argue with him because yeah, it definitely looked pretty fucking bad. \n\t\u201cHoly fuck, man. You\u2019re telling me the cult did this?\u201d \n\t\u201cWho the fuck else is gonna do it, Daniel? I swear you ask the dumbest fucking questions, dude. Why don\u2019t you just let me have time to figure out how the fuck I\u2019m supposed to clean this shit up instead of being intrusive for no fucking reason? Can you do that just for today, Daniel? Fucking thank you.\u201d \n\tYeah, that was my queue to leave. I didn\u2019t agree with his aggression but I mean it wasn\u2019t my yard covered in guts and gore, come on. \nI just carried on about my day trying to forget the interaction all together. I went to work for 12 hours and had stopped for food on the way home and as I was finally pulling into my driveway I noticed that my neighbors front door was standing wide open even though there weren\u2019t any cars in the driveway. \n\tNow listen. I\u2019m a pretty optimistic guy and I really try turning the other cheek which is probably why I did what I did. \n\tI parked my car and instead of going into my house I went straight to my neighbors. \n\u201cChris!\u201d I called out from his front door. No reply. I called out again, this time louder, \u201cChris! Your door is wide open, man, are you in there?\u201d Still no reply. \n\tI made the sober decision to just say fuck it and go inside. I mean it\u2019s not like I\u2019m trying to steal from the guy, I'm just trying to be a good neighbor. Please God do not let him shoot me. \n\tI stepped inside and started looking around. Everything seemed to be in order, granted I\u2019d never even seen the inside of this house before, but it seemed like everything was the way it should be. I kept searching and found that the dressers in all the rooms had been cleaned out but other than that everything seemed untouched. \n\tI remembered the stories I\u2019d heard about the farmers and how they\u2019d seemed to have just left once their livestock had been killed. But Chris wasn\u2019t a farmer? Chris did construction work for Christ's sake. I don't even think he had any pets. After the unsuccessful search of his home I made my way to his backyard. \n\tIt had been picked clean. The intestines, the gore, not even a drop of blood seemed to have remained. \u201cGood shit, Chris.\u201d I thought to myself. I knew for a fact that there wasn\u2019t any way in hell that I\u2019d have been able to clean up what had been done to his backyard in a weekend, let alone a day. \u201cMaybe he was just so tired after all that work that he just forgot to make sure his door was closed before going out to grab something to eat?\u201d I thought. However, that didn\u2019t answer the question of the dressers being emptied. \u201cMmmm maybe they just wanted to get away from the house for the night on account of the bad memories of the day?\u201d \n\tYeah, that was the explanation I was gonna have to go with because I was just drained. My shift had pretty much zapped me of all my energy and I was missing my bed like crazy. \n\tThe next day when there were still no cars in Chris\u2019s driveway I grew a little bit more concerned but still went about my day as usual. \n\tHowever, this day when I came home from work it was *my* yard that had been destroyed. I was distraught, man, I didn\u2019t even know where to start. I wouldn\u2019t have even dreamed of starting the clean-up right after work so I decided to take the next day off to straighten everything up. That night while I was sleeping I was awoken by a rummaging at my front door. I\u2019m a light sleeper so even the light scratching and rattling at the door was enough to wake me, and once I processed what I was hearing I was out of bed Immediately. \n\tI\u2019m not a gun owner but I did have a metal baseball bat by my bed that I scooped up and hid behind my  bedroom door with. \n\tI heard the front door finally pop open and my blood froze. Two pairs of footsteps made their way into my home and I heard them separate and start searching. \n\tWhen I heard one of the intruders making their way towards my bedroom my grip on the bat tightened. I prepared myself for the worst and simply waited. \n\tMy door creaked open and I swear to God, the person who came into my room was wearing the skull of a pig. It was rotting and decayed and I could still smell the stench of death coming from it, and I was absolutely petrified. \n\tThey crept towards my bed with what looked to be a syringe in their hand. When they ripped the covers back and saw that I wasn\u2019t there, that\u2019s when I lunged forward and swung the bat as hard as I could. \n\tIt cracked the skull helmet but it wasn\u2019t enough to completely disable the attacker and they fought fiercely. At this point the other intruder had come running into the room and was helping restrain me.  I tried my best to fight but even with the bat they\u2019d still managed to poke me with the syringe and soon I was stumbling..then crawling..then sleeping.\n\tI kept waking up periodically and would see the two stuffing my clothes and other belongings into plastic garbage bags. I also remember being really loopy and out of it as they dragged me out of the house and towards the back doors of a white van that they had backed into my driveway. \n\t\n\tThen I remember being dragged out of the back of the van and into the woods by 3 guys who weren\u2019t the ones who had taken me from my house.\nI awoke for real this time  in the woods surrounded by disgusting, bulimic looking people. A fire was blazing in the middle of the group, and what seemed to be their preacher was chanting some sort of sermon. \u201cPain my children. Pain and suffering is what binds us all together. We are all human, we are all experiencing this\u2026depression. The people of this world are pampered. They have strayed from the word of God. They do not comprehend the suffering that is required to become a child of our holy Father. They do not know because we have yet to show them. That ends today my children. Today we will show them why they must suffer for the greater good.\u201d\n All of his followers were wearing some type of animal skull as head gear and all of them looked as though they were deathly ill. They were all naked and their teeth, oh my God their teeth. They had looked as though they were forcibly broken and chipped in order to make them  jagged and sharp. They had no fingertips because the flesh had been stripped from the bone of each phalange, and the bones had been sharpened to a fine point on each hand. \n\tThe chanting from the preacher was echoing and nearly deafening in my ringing ears as I clasped both my hands over them. All eyes were off me and on the preacher so I took the opportunity to book it as fast as I could out of the woods. By some miracle of God I ended up on a road that I recognized and started making my way home. \nI walked for 4 hours with my only light being the moon bouncing off the reflectors on the road. You wanna know how far from my house I was? 15 fucking miles. \nWhen I finally saw the familiar sight of my roof creeping up over the horizon in the rising sun I began sprinting. I didn\u2019t care how tired I was, I just wanted to get into that house as quickly as I possibly could. \nI ran through the front door and immediately locked it behind me before going up to my room. \nMy dressers were completely empty. My phone was gone and so were my keys and my car. I stumbled over to a neighbor's house to try and get a phone to call 911 when I noticed something. My yard had also been picked completely clean. The carnage left in my yard was almost exactly the same as that left in Chris\u2019s but now it was gone entirely. I made my way to the neighbors house and pretty much begged them to let me dial 911. \nOnce they arrived I explained to them exactly what had happened and you know what they told me? They told me to change my locks and to let them know if any other strange occurrences happen. Are you fucking kidding me? I\u2019m drugged and kidnapped out of my own home before being taken to the woods to be sacrificed and these people are gonna tell me to change my locks? I couldn\u2019t even comprehend it. \nI changed those locks though, I\u2019ll tell you that much. Not only that but I added locks to every door in my house, I had no intentions on letting anything like that happen ever again. \nTime went on and I even went back to work but about 4 weeks later I started feeling a little under the weather. I thought I just had a regular head flu but when symptoms worsened after a week I ended up going to the clinic. As it turns out, those animals had given me HIV using the syringe that they had drugged me with. \nI was a 20 year old freshly starting life and now that life was ruined by complete strangers who I had nothing to do with. I was devastated. I spent days locked in my house just sulking and contemplating. The doctors hadn\u2019t even given me medication. They gave me a diagnosis, told me good luck, and sent me on my way. Never really thought I\u2019d need health insurance. \nThis entire world seemed like it was against me. My neighbors stopped talking to me. The ones that were left, anyway, the fucking cult had hit a few more yards with their little party decorations before the families they were targeting suddenly \u201cevacuated the premisis.\u201d \nI didn\u2019t care though. My life was ruined and I was simply waiting to die. All I was doing at this point was rotting from the inside out and wasting away in my bedroom. \nI made a decision, though. They weren\u2019t getting away with this. I went out and I bought a 9 millimeter handgun and I headed back to where these monsters had taken me in the first place. No way in hell was I going to be able to take out all of them but I\u2019d be GodDamned if I didn\u2019t take out some of them.  \nI trekked through the woods with the taste of revenge and scotch in my mouth. The taste turned to sheer salivation when I started hearing the sounds of human activity and seeing the smoke of fire about 250 yards away. I began moving with the same intensity that I\u2019d shown when running towards my house all those weeks ago. I was running towards my sanctuary then. The one place that was meant to guarantee my safety; and now here I was, running towards the people that took all of that away from me. \nI charged into the group expecting a fight to ensue. Instead I was greeted with applause and roaring cheers. \u201cWe knew our brother would rejoin us, my children. And here he is! Here he is with his sword that he intends to use to cut us down. Rejoice my children for the day of prophecy has finally come upon us.\u201d The cheers grew thunderous and disorienting so I fired a shot into the air. \n\u201cYou sick diseased fucks have taken everything from me. You\u2019ve ruined everything!\u201d I screamed, firing another round into a bystanding member. This caused immense whoops from the crowd. \n\u201cNo my child, you\u2019ve got it wrong.\u201d the preacher budded in with his thick Georgian drawl. \u201cWe haven\u2019t taken anything from you, instead we have given you something new. We\u2019ve given you something to induce suffering my sweet boy. Your suffering will grant you eternal life, child, can\u2019t you see?\u201d \nI put a bullet in his kneecap and he keeled over in pain. His cries soon turned into laughter, however, and he began preaching at me again. \u201cPain brings about change, Daniel. Pain is that which binds the human race together. You are not alone in your suffering, you are made stronger by your hardship.\u201d I lowered my pistol. Why was he..making sense? What was I doing? I\u2019m here to murder people? I\u2019ve just shot two people? My manic state was broken and I quickly snapped back to reality. \n\tWasn\u2019t much I could do at this point, though, so with my justified anger and conscience induced clarity I instructed everyone to remove their skulls. \nI saw my doctor. I saw the police officers who\u2019d helped me when my yard was vandalized. I even saw my neighbor. \nThe more people started taking off their masks the more I started recognizing faces. The deli clerk, the butcher, my fucking boss holy shit. I was surrounded by 100 or so of the people who I interacted with every single day. \u201cThe day of mass suffering has come, my son.\u201d the preacher spoke. \u201cThe day of our Lord is coming and you were the last one needed in order for this day to come to fruition.\u201d \nJust then as if scripted, every member surrounding me removed razors that had been tucked away underneath the flaps of their wrists and raised them to their necks. In unison they all began slicing at their jugular veins and geysers of blood erupted all around me. \u201cThis is true suffering, boy.\u201d hysterically laughed the preacher. \u201cThis is what will bring us back to the light of our father. Your disease is a gift from a God who demands pain in order to reach his divine kingdom.\u201d  I fired another round directly between his eyes out of fear and sheer shock. Everyone around me lay dead in a  pool of their own diseased blood. The preacher lay before me with a leaking hole in his head staining my shoes with its contents. \nI had no idea what to do. All I knew to do was go back home. And that\u2019s where I\u2019ve been for the past couple of weeks. Funnily enough, no news of the mass suicide has gotten any air time around here. Nobody mentions how our population is now about 100 people less. Not even the police talk about how they\u2019ve lost some of their very own officers. Everyone has simply moved on as if nothing happened. All the facebook posts pertaining to a cult here have been removed and I can\u2019t seem to find any of the newspapers with the headline. \nMiraculously though, I don\u2019t feel sick anymore. I learned that consuming the vital organs of the animals they slaughtered is what the cult believed kept them alive. They afflicted as much pain as they could upon themselves because the divine feeling of pain is what they believed brought them closer to the almighty God. So that\u2019s what I did. I began consuming the hearts and lungs of small livestock in hopes of curing myself. I couldn\u2019t live with the disease these people had infected me with and I grew desperate. At first I felt no different. I was still experiencing abdominal pain and it was getting pretty hard to swallow. By the third day I started feeling\u2026stronger. It started feeling like I wasn\u2019t even sick anymore by the 5th day. The one thing I noticed was I was getting an undeniable urge to hurt myself. \nI\u2019d go for walks to find barbed wire fences just so I could grip the spikes and puncture my palms. I\u2019d carry a power saw blade around in my back pocket just so I could carve my thighs to get my fix throughout the day. Every time I felt pain it felt like I was urged to find more, I craved more. \nI continued eating the hearts of animals because I just couldn\u2019t stop, my heart grew to absolutely love the power it made me feel. So much so that it started feeling..religious. It started feeling like this was what humans were meant for. We were meant to experience this, we were meant to have this type of heavenly burdens. Our bodies are simply vessels for a mind that has been disconnected from God since the serpent coaxed Eve into eating the fruit. \nI began preaching my revelations to anyone who would listen. I\u2019d invite them to my home and make them experience suffering. I\u2019d cleanse them of their earthy bliss. No more would they believe enlightenment could be achieved without sacrifice. They would leave renewed and replenished. \nAs the traction of my new findings grew, eventually I garnered support from local police. It wasn\u2019t hard convincing them that this was the intended way of us children. With them on my side me and my people were free to feed on as much livestock as it took to heal us of our mortal health issues. \nWe made the choice to mark who we wish to convert to our religion with the carcasses of the animals that we kill. We see it as an omen that the Lord has chosen them and their families as humble servants who must see the light of retribution.\nWe\u2019ve also  decided that the world is ready for our gift so I have instructed my flock to spread my word to any corner of this country they can reach. Pain will be the cleanser of our sin. Suffering will burn the impurities from the flesh of his subjects. A cult has appeared in my town, and soon it will appear in yours too. \n\n\n"},"7":{"title":"Rolie Polie Olie - Lost Episode","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kbt6wk\/rolie_polie_olie_lost_episode\/","flair":"Trollpasta Story","author":"Official_Jax","selftext":"I used to love Rolie Polie Olie. I had the games, watched the movies and watched all the episodes. Well, not all of them. My uncle worked for a intern at Walt Disney Studios and worked on \"Rolie Polie Olie\". His idea of episodes was a little... dark. His ideas are more dark than the child-friendly episodes. So he sent me test DVDs so if someone watched them, he would know to fix any errors and\/or change something that seemed wrong.\n\nLast September, I was home and found a DVD in the kitchen titled \"Olie's Sad Day\". I thought this was a episode about Olie getting sad but cheering up at the end, but no. I Popped it in the DVD player and 1st popped up was a bloody Sonic who was saying \"turn back\" in a sad voice 3 times. He died after. Then it went to the menu and it was weird. 1st off, the picture was a bloody Olie having Zowie's head, Off her body. \"GOOD GRAVY!\" I shouted. Then there were 3 bloody options, \"Play Episode\", \"Bonus Feature\" and a button with a bloody Sonic head on it. I first pressed the Sonic button then i heard Sonic scream for 3 seconds. Then the button disappeared. I played the short after.\n\nThe intro started, but Olie was the only one in it. Huh. Weird. Anyway the episode started with blood red text that read \"Olie's Sad Day\", like on the DVD. It started with Olie being angry then grabbing a knife. He said something quiet but i heard it. He said \"it is time for them to die...\" Them?! Does he mean... ...oh no.\n\nThen the next scene appeared. Olie was eating breakfast. After he was done, he said to his mom that he and Spot (Olie's dog) are gonna go for a walk. And they went. Then when they were outside, Olie stabbed Spot in the brain 1000 times with hyper-realistic blood. He said quietly, \"Sleep tight, Spot. You're free.\"\n\nThen he killed Billy Bevel (Olie's best friend) with a gun. \"GOOD GOD! I GOTTA GET THIS OUTTA HERE!!!\" So I pressed \"Eject\" on my DVD player but it would not work. Then he killed everyone with a nuke except himself.\n\nThen, the last scene ended. Olie faced at me and said \"You Fool. When you least expect it, I will find you and kill you. So be ready.\" And killed himself. Then the credits happened, but they were bloody text on a stone-like background. Then 15 minutes later, I died.\n\nOh and if you were wondering was the Bonus Feature is, it was a deleted scene. On it, a longer scene of Olie going crazy is shown, with bloodshot eyes and everything. He was about to scream, but the scene was replaced by a demon refencing Zowie. In the background, a demonic Sonic X theme could be heard and it went to static for 45 minutes. Then it went back to the menu."},"8":{"title":"The Weight of Ashes","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kbjxaw\/the_weight_of_ashes\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"RealJakeyPooV","selftext":"# Chapter 1: The Man Who Almost Healed\n\nRobert Hayes never expected to feel joy again after Anna died. Some nights, he still woke reaching for her\u2014fumbling blindly through the darkness for a hand that would never be there again. Grief, he realized, had a smell: old clothes, cold sheets, unopened mail.\n\nJust before Anna\u2019s passing, the twins had been born\u2014tiny, furious fists clenching at the air. Every new day with them had felt like a second chance. Emma, with her mother's green eyes and fierce little laugh. Samuel, quieter, thoughtful even as an infant, furrowing his brow like he was trying to solve the world's problems.\n\nThey filled the house with life again. Noise. Color. Robert cooked terrible pancakes every Sunday\u2014Emma demanding extra syrup, Samuel meticulously sorting his blueberries before eating. He read to them every night, even when they fell asleep halfway through. They built snowmen with mittened hands in the winter, fed ducks at the pond in spring, ran barefoot through sprinklers under the sticky heat of summer.\n\nAnd every night, after the giggles and the mess and the exhaustion, Robert kissed their foreheads and whispered the same thing: \"I will always protect you.\"\n\nHe meant it.\n\nThat November afternoon was gray and damp, the misty rain making the world look like it was dissolving at the edges. Emma wanted a pumpkin \"big enough to sit inside,\" while Samuel had chosen one lopsided and scarred, insisting it had \"character.\" Robert strapped them into their booster seats, singing along with the radio, the car filled with syrupy, sticky laughter.\n\nThe semi-truck came out of nowhere. One moment: headlights. The next: twisting metal. Then\u2014silence.\n\nWhen Robert came to, hanging upside down from his seatbelt, the only sound was the soft hiss of the ruined engine. He screamed for them. Clawed at the wreckage. Dragged himself, bleeding and broken, toward the back. Emma and Samuel were gone. Still buckled in, so small, so still.\n\nAt the funeral, Robert stood between two tiny white caskets, staring as faces blurred around him and words tumbled into meaningless noise.\n\n\"God has a plan.\" \"They're angels now.\" \"Time heals.\"\n\nTime, Robert thought numbly, had already taken everything.\n\nThat night, alone in the nursery, clutching a sock no bigger than his thumb, he whispered the only prayer left to him: \"Bring them back.\"\n\nNo one answered.\n\n\n\n# Chapter 2: Hollow Men\n\nThe days after the funeral blurred together, each one a paler copy of the last. Robert woke at dawn, not because he wanted to, but because the house demanded it\u2014cruel reminders of a life that no longer existed. Samuel\u2019s alarm still chirped at seven a.m., a tiny little jingle that once made Samuel giggle under the covers. Robert couldn\u2019t bring himself to turn it off. He brewed coffee he didn\u2019t drink, packed lunches no one would eat, reached for tiny jackets that would never again be worn. Every movement ended the same way: with the silence pressing in like water in a sinking room.\n\nHe tried to hold the pieces together at first. Sat stiffly in grief counseling groups while strangers passed sorrow back and forth like trading cards. He nodded at the talk of \u201cstages,\u201d \u201chealing,\u201d \u201ccoping,\u201d while his chest felt like it was filling with wet cement. He adopted a dog\u2014a golden retriever named Daisy. The shelter said she was \u201cgood with kids.\u201d Robert brought her home, hoping maybe something would spark again. But Daisy only whined at the door, as if she, too, was waiting for children who would never come home. Three days later, he returned her. The woman at the shelter didn\u2019t ask why.\n\nBy spring, the house was immaculate, sterile\u2014as if polished grief could make it livable again. The nursery remained untouched. The firetruck sat mid-rescue on the rug. A doll lay half-tucked beneath a tiny pillow, eternally ready for sleep. Sometimes Robert thought he heard them laughing upstairs, voices soft and wild and real as breath. Sometimes, he answered back.\n\nOutside, the world moved on. Children shrieked with joy in parks. Mothers chased toddlers through grocery aisles. Fathers hoisted giggling kids onto their shoulders at county fairs. At first, Robert turned away from these scenes, flinching like they were gunshots. But soon, he began to watch. He stood in the shadows of the elementary school parking lot, leaning against his rusted truck, staring at the children spilling through the doors\u2014backpacks bouncing, shoes untied, voices lifted in a chorus of lives untouched by loss.\n\n\"Why them?\" he thought. \"Why not mine?\"\n\nThe resentment crept in like mold beneath the wallpaper\u2014quiet, patient, inevitable.\n\nOne evening, he sat alone in the dim light of the living room. An untouched bottle of whiskey sat on the table, sweating with condensation. The television flickered with cartoons\u2014a plastic family around a plastic dinner table, all laughter and pastel perfection. Robert stared at the screen. Then, without warning, he hurled the remote across the room. It shattered against the wall, leaving a long, ugly crack.\n\nHis chest heaved with silent, shaking sobs. Not for Anna. Not even for Emma and Samuel. But for himself. For the man he used to be. For the father he failed to stay.\n\nThe next morning, without planning to, Robert drove to the school lot before dawn. The world was still dark, the pavement damp with night. A bright blue minivan caught his eye\u2014plastered with \u201cProud Parent\u201d stickers and stick-figure decals of smiling children, their parents, and two dogs. Robert knelt beside it, the pocketknife flashing briefly in the dim light. He peeled the tiny stick-figure children from the back window, one by one. Then he slashed the tire, slow and steady, the blade whispering through rubber like breath.\n\nWhen the mother discovered the damage hours later\u2014cursing, frantic, dragging her children into another car\u2014Robert smiled for the first time in months. A small, broken thing. It didn\u2019t fix anything. It didn\u2019t bring Emma and Samuel back. But it shifted the weight in his chest\u2014just enough for him to breathe.\n\nThat night, he dreamed of them. Emma laughing, Samuel running barefoot through the grass, fireflies sparking in the gold-washed twilight. He woke to silence, the dream already fading. But something else stirred beneath the grief.\n\nA flicker.\n\nControl.\n\n\n\n# Chapter 3: Seeds of Malice\n\nThe second time, it wasn\u2019t enough to slash a tire. Robert needed them to feel it. Not just the inconvenience, not just the momentary panic. He needed them to understand that joy was a fragile, borrowed thing\u2014one that could be ripped away just as suddenly as it was given. Like his had been.\n\nAt dusk, the school parking lot stood silent, the last child long since swept up in a waiting minivan. Robert moved through the rows of bicycles like a man walking among gravestones. Each one upright. Untouched. Proud. He slipped a box cutter from his coat pocket. The first brake cable sliced with almost no resistance. Then another. Then another. He moved methodically\u2014his grief becoming surgical.\n\nThe next morning, from the privacy of his truck, Robert watched a boy coast down a hill\u2014fast, laughing, light. And then the bike didn\u2019t stop. The child\u2019s face turned. Laughter crumpled into terror. He crashed hard, metal meeting bone. A broken wrist. Blood in his mouth. Screams.\n\nParents swarmed like bees kicked from a hive, their voices panicked, their eyes wide. Robert didn\u2019t move. He watched it all with hands trembling faintly in his lap.\n\nHe thought it would be enough.\n\nBut two weeks later, the boy returned. Cast on his arm. A gap where his front teeth had been. And he was laughing again. Like nothing had changed.\n\nRobert\u2019s jaw clenched until it hurt. They hadn\u2019t learned. They had already begun to forget.\n\nThe annual Harvest Festival arrived in a blur of orange booths and plastic spiderwebs, cotton candy, and hay bales. Children raced from game to game, cheeks flushed from the cold, arms swinging bags of prizes. He moved through the maze like a ghost. No one looked twice at the man with the hood pulled low. Why would they?\n\nChildren leaned over tubs of apples, dunking their heads, emerging with triumphant smiles. Emma would have loved this. She would have squealed with laughter, water dripping from her curls, cheeks red from the chill.\n\nHis hands shook as he slipped the crushed glass into the tub. Ground fine\u2014but not invisible. Sharp enough. Just sharp enough. He lingered nearby, heart pounding like a drum inside his ribs.\n\nThe first scream cut through the carnival like lightning. A boy stumbled back from the tub, blood streaming from his mouth, his cry high and broken. More screams followed. Mothers pulled their children close. Booths tipped. Lights flickered. The festival collapsed into chaos.\n\nStill\u2014not enough.\n\nRobert returned home and sat in the nursery. The crib was cold. The racecar bed untouched. The silence as thick as syrup. He sat on the hardwood floor, knees to his chest, and whispered:\n\n\"They don\u2019t remember you.\"\n\nHis voice cracked. Not from rage. But from emptiness.\n\nThe playground came next. The place they had loved the most.\n\nAt three in the morning, Robert crept across the dewy grass, fog clinging low, as if the world were trying to hide what he was becoming. He wore gloves. Moved like a man fixing something broken. He loosened the bolts on the swings just enough that the nuts would fall after a few good pushes. He smeared grease across the rungs of the slide. Buried broken glass beneath the innocent softness of the sandbox. Then he left.\n\nThe next day, he parked nearby, watching as the playground filled with children again. The laughter returned so easily, as if it had never left.\n\nThen came the fall.\n\nA boy\u2014maybe six\u2014slipped from the monkey bars and struck his head on the edge of the platform. Blood pooled in the dirt. His mother\u2019s scream sounded like something being torn in half. An ambulance arrived. The playground emptied.\n\nRobert sat in his truck and felt that same flicker in his chest. Not joy. Not peace.\n\nBut control.\n\nFor a moment, he wasn\u2019t the man who had clutched a tiny sock and begged God to make a trade. He was the one who turned the screws. The one who made the world bend.\n\nHe didn\u2019t stop.\n\n\n\n# Chapter 4: The Gentle Push\n\nThe river ran like an old scar along the edge of Halston, swollen and restless after weeks of rain. Robert stood alone at the water\u2019s edge, the damp earth sucking at his boots, the air cold enough to bite through his coat. Across the park, families moved like faint shadows in the fog, children darting between the trees, their laughter muted and distant, like memories worn thin by time.\n\nHe watched them without blinking.\n\nHe watched him.\n\nA small boy, maybe five or six years old, wandered away from the others, rain boots slapping through shallow puddles, his coat slipping off one shoulder. Robert saw how easily it happened\u2014the gap between a parent's distracted glance, the careless joy of a child unaware of how quickly the world could take everything from him.\n\nRobert moved without thinking. Not planning. Not deciding. Just following the pull inside him, a pull shaped by loss and stitched together with rage.\n\nHe crossed the grass in slow, steady strides, boots silent against the wet earth. When he reached the boy, he didn't say a word. He simply placed a hand on the child's small back\u2014a touch as light as breath, the kind of touch a father might give to steady his son, to guide him back to safety.\n\nBut this time, there was no safety.\n\nThe boy stumbled forward. The slick ground gave way beneath his boots. His arms flailed once, a startled gasp escaping his mouth, and then the river took him.\n\nNo thrashing. No screaming. Just the slow, cold pull of the current swallowing him whole.\n\nRobert turned away before the first cries rang out. He walked into the trees, his breath misting in the frigid air, his hands curling into fists inside his sleeves. Behind him, screams split the fog, voices shattered the quiet\u2014parents running, wading into the water too late.\n\nHe didn\u2019t stop. He didn\u2019t look back.\n\nThat night, Robert sat cross-legged between Emma\u2019s crib and Samuel\u2019s racecar bed. The nursery smelled of dust and faded dreams. He placed his hands in his lap, palms open like a man offering an apology no one would ever hear, and he whispered into the hollow silence:\n\n\"I made it fair.\"\n\nThe words tasted like ash on his tongue.\n\nFor the first time in months, he slept through the night, deep and dreamless.\n\nBut morning brought no peace.\n\nBy noon, the riverbank had transformed into a shrine. Flowers and stuffed animals lined the muddy ground. Notes written in childish handwriting flapped in the wind. Candles guttered against the damp air. Children stood holding hands, their faces pale with confusion as their parents clutched them tighter, their grief raw and noisy.\n\nRobert drove past slowly, his knuckles white against the steering wheel. He watched them weep, saw their shoulders shake with the weight of a loss they couldn\u2019t contain.\n\nFor a moment, he felt something close to satisfaction. A shifting of the scales.\n\nBut as he rounded the bend and the river disappeared from view, the satisfaction dissolved, leaving behind a familiar emptiness.\n\nThey would mourn today. Tomorrow, they would forget.\n\nThey always forget.\n\n\n\n# Chapter 5: The Town Crumbles\n\nThree days later, the boy\u2019s body was pulled from the river, tangled in roots and mud, bloated from the cold. The coroner called it an accident. Drowning. A tragic slip. Everyone in Halston nodded and murmured and avoided each other\u2019s eyes. But something changed.\n\nThe parks emptied. Sidewalks once buzzing with bikes and hopscotch now lay silent under cloudy skies. Parents walked their children to school in tight clumps, hands gripped a little too tightly, eyes flicking to every passing car. Playgrounds stood deserted beneath creaking swings and rusting chains. But it didn\u2019t last.\n\nA week passed. Then another. The fences around the park came down. Children returned\u2014cautious at first, then louder, bolder. The shrieks of joy returned, diluted with only a trace of caution. The town, like it always did, began to forget.\n\nRobert couldn\u2019t stand it.\n\nHe returned to the scene of the first fall\u2014Miller Park\u2014under the cover of fog and early morning darkness. The playground had been repaired. New bolts gleamed beneath the swing seats. New paint shone on the monkey bars.\n\nRobert smiled bitterly. Then he went to work.\n\nHe loosened the bolts again, not so much that they would fall immediately, but just enough to ensure failure. Enough to remind. Enough to reopen the wound.\n\nThat morning, a boy ran ahead of his mother, eager to swing higher, faster. Robert watched from his truck as the seat tore loose in mid-air, the boy thrown to the gravel below like a puppet with its strings cut. Another scream. Another ambulance. Another tiny victory. But it wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nOne broken arm would never equal two coffins.\n\nThanksgiving loomed, brittle and joyless. Halston strung up lights, tried to bake its way back into comfort, but everything tasted like fear. Robert didn\u2019t feel it soften. If anything, the ache in his chest had sharpened.\n\nHe found his next moment during a birthday party\u2014balloons tied to fence posts, paper hats, children screaming with sugared laughter. Seven years old. The age Emma and Samuel would have been.\n\nHe watched from the alley behind the house, his jacket dusted with soot to match the disguise\u2014just another utility worker. He didn\u2019t need threats or blackmail this time. He didn\u2019t need help.\n\nJust a soft smile. A kind voice. A simple story about a missing puppy.\n\nThe little girl followed him willingly.\n\nIn the plastic playhouse near the edge of the yard, Robert tucked her gently beneath unopened presents. Her arms were folded neatly. Her hair smoothed back. He set Emma\u2019s old music box beside her, its tune warped and gasping. It played three broken notes before clicking into silence.\n\nShe looked like she was sleeping.\n\nBy the time the party noticed she was missing, Robert was already miles away. He drove in silence, humming the lullaby softly under his breath, as if to soothe himself more than her.\n\nBut the hollow inside him didn\u2019t shrink.\n\nWinter came early that year. Snow blanketed the sidewalks. The playgrounds stayed empty now\u2014not because of caution, but because of cold. Christmas lights blinked behind drawn curtains. People whispered more often than they spoke.\n\nAnd still, the town tried to move forward.\n\nRobert watched two boys skipping stones into the water where the river hadn\u2019t yet frozen. They were brothers. They laughed without fear. Without consequence.\n\nSamuel should have had a brother to skip stones with.\n\nRobert crouched beside them. Smiled. Held out a daisy chain he had woven in the truck\u2014white flowers strung together with trembling hands. The boys giggled and reached for it.\n\nHe guided them closer to the edge.\n\nOne soft push.\n\nThe river accepted them.\n\nWhen their bodies were found seventeen days later, wrapped in each other\u2019s arms beneath a frozen bend, the daisy chain had vanished. But Robert still saw it\u2014looped around their wrists like a crown of thorns.\n\nElsewhere in town, Linda Moore sat in front of her computer. Her spreadsheet blinked. A child\u2019s name\u2014Eli Meyers\u2014suddenly shifted rows. Not one she had touched. Not one she had assigned.\n\nBeside the name, a new comment appeared: \u201cHe looks like Samuel did when he lost his first tooth.\u201d\n\nThen a new tab opened\u2014her niece\u2019s photo, taken from outside the school that morning. Through a window. Across glass.\n\nThe screen blinked red: \u201cShe still likes hide-and-seek, right?\u201d\n\nLinda\u2019s hands hovered over the keys. She didn\u2019t call anyone. She didn\u2019t say anything. She just let the change stand.\n\nThat afternoon, Eli boarded the wrong van for a field trip. When the chaperones reached the botanical gardens, they came up one short. They retraced every step, called his name until their voices cracked. But Eli was gone.\n\nThe police found his backpack three days later, tucked under a hedge near the perimeter fence. Zipper closed. Lunch untouched. No struggle. No footprints. No sign of him at all.\n\nJust silence.\n\nThe school shut down its field trip program. Metal detectors were installed the next week\u2014secondhand machines that buzzed even when touched gently. Classroom doors were fitted with new locks. Parent volunteers were fingerprinted. A dusk curfew followed.\n\nIn a closed-door meeting, someone on the city council finally said it out loud:\n\n\u201cSabotage.\u201d\n\nMaria Vance stood outside Halston Elementary the next morning. The sky was gray, the cold sharp enough to sting. Parents didn\u2019t make eye contact. Teachers moved like ghosts. Children whispered like everything was a secret.\n\nMaria didn\u2019t need the pins on her map anymore. She could feel the pattern in her bones.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t chaos.\n\nThis was design.\n\nAnd whoever was behind it\u2026 they were just getting started.\n\n  \n\n\n# Chapter 6: Graves and Whispers\n\nAnother funeral. Another headline. Another casket lowered into the frozen ground while a town full of trembling hands tried to convince themselves that prayer could hold back death. Halston draped itself in mourning again, but the grief rang hollow. They weren\u2019t mourning Robert\u2019s children. They were mourning their own safety, their own illusions.\n\nStill, life in Halston ground on. The grocery stores stayed open. The school bell still rang. The church choir resumed, voices cracking on and off-key. Robert watched it all from the outside, a man staring through glass at a world he no longer belonged to. Their fear wasn\u2019t enough. Their tears weren't enough. They had forgotten Emma and Samuel.\n\nSo he decided to make them remember.\n\nHe found the perfect place: a crumbling church tucked into a forgotten bend of road, its steeple sagging like a broken finger pointed skyward. Once a place of baptisms and vows, now it stank of mildew and mouse droppings. Still, there was something fitting about it. Robert prepared carefully. He built a crude cross out of rotting pew backs. He scavenged candles from a thrift store bin. He smuggled in a battered cassette deck, loaded with a single song\u2014\"Safe in His Arms,\" warped and warbling with age.\n\nHe thought about Emma humming along to hymns in the backseat, Samuel tapping his feet without knowing the words. He thought about the empty nursery and the promises he had failed to keep.\n\nThe boy he chose wasn\u2019t special. Just small. Just alone. Harold Knox, the school bus driver, had been warned months before. A photo of his daughter tucked inside his glovebox. A note in red marker: \"He will suffer. Or she will.\" Nails delivered in a plain manila envelope.\n\nOn a cold Thursday morning, the bus paused at Pine Creek stop. Fog licked the ground like low smoke. One child stepped off. The doors hissed shut behind him. Robert was waiting in the trees.\n\nThe boy didn\u2019t scream. He didn\u2019t run. He simply blinked up at the man reaching out to him. Inside the ruined church, Robert worked quickly but carefully. The child was lifted onto the wooden cross, his back pressed to the splintering wood. Nails were driven through soft palms and tender feet. Not savagely\u2014but deliberately, with grim reverence. Each strike of the hammer echoed through the empty rafters like the tolling of a slow funeral bell.\n\n\"You'll see them soon,\" Robert whispered as he drove the final nail home. \"My little ones are waiting.\"\n\nHe placed a paper crown on the boy\u2019s brow. Smeared a rough ash cross over the child's small chest. Lit six candles at the base of the altar. Then he pressed play. The hymn trickled through the cold, rotten air, warbling and distant. Robert stood for a long moment, his eyes stinging, before he turned and walked away. He locked the doors behind him, leaving the boy crucified beneath the broken arches.\n\nIt was the boy\u2019s mother who found him. She had followed the music, though no one else had heard it. She had forced the heavy doors open and fallen to her knees at the sight. The boy was alive. Barely. But something essential in him\u2014something fragile and bright\u2014had been extinguished forever.\n\nHalston did not rally around this tragedy. There were no vigils. No bake sales. No Facebook groups offering casseroles and prayers. They shut their church doors. Canceled choir practice. Turned their faces away from their own shame.\n\nMaria Vance stood outside the ruined church, the rain soaking through her coat, her hair plastered to her forehead. She didn\u2019t light a cigarette. Didn\u2019t open her notepad. She just stared through the doorway at the altar, at the boy nailed to the cross, at the candles sputtering against the wet wind.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t revenge anymore. It wasn\u2019t even grief. This was ritual.\n\nThat night, Maria tore everything off the walls of her office. Maps, photographs, reports\u2014all of it came down. She started over with red string and thumbtacks, tracing each death, each disappearance, each shattered life. And when she stepped back, she saw it for what it was: a spiral.\n\nNot random chaos. Not accidents. A wound closing in on itself.\n\nAt its center: silence. No fingerprints. No footprints. No smoking gun. Just grief. And grief was spreading like infection.\n\nParents pulled their children out of school. The Christmas pageant was canceled. The playgrounds sat under gathering drifts of snow, swings frozen mid-sway. Stores boarded their windows after dark. Halston was curling inward, shrinking, dying a little more each day.\n\nAnd somewhere, Maria knew, the hand behind all of it was still moving.\n\nShe didn\u2019t have proof. Not yet. But she could feel it in her bones.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t over. Not even close.\n\nLate that night, staring at her empty wall, Maria whispered to the darkness: \"I\u2019m coming for you.\"\n\nAnd somewhere out in the dead heart of Halston, something whispered back.\n\n  \n\n\n# Chapter 7: The Spider\u2019s Web\n\nThe sketchbook was found by accident, jammed between a stack of overdue returns at the Halston Public Library. A volunteer almost tossed it into the donation bin without looking. Curiosity saved it\u2014and maybe saved lives.\n\nAt first glance, it looked like any child's notebook. Tattered corners. Smudges of dirt. But inside, Maria Vance saw what others might have missed. She flipped through the pages with gloved hands, her stomach tightening with every turn.\n\nChildren, sketched in trembling pencil lines, filled the pages. Their faces twisted in terror. Scenes of drowning, of falling, of burning playgrounds and broken swings. Some pages had dates scrawled in the margins\u2014events that had already happened. Others bore dates that hadn\u2019t yet arrived.\n\nMixed among the drawings were music notes, faint staves from hymns, each line annotated with uneven, obsessive care. On one page, three candles formed a triangle, familiar from the church scene. On another, a child's chest bore the ash cross Robert had smeared. It was all there\u2014mapped in quiet, meticulous horror.\n\nOne line, scrawled over and over in the margins, stopped Maria cold: \"I don\u2019t want them to suffer. I want them to remember. To feel it. To see them. Emma liked daisies. Samuel hated swings. They laughed on rainy days. Please. Remember.\"\n\nShe pressed her hand to her mouth, her eyes stinging. This wasn\u2019t just violence. This was love\u2014twisted, broken love, weaponized into something unrecognizable.\n\nAt the bottom of many pages, a code repeated again and again: 19.73.14.8.21\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a phone number. It wasn\u2019t coordinates. It wasn\u2019t a date. Maria stayed up all night breaking it down. Old habits from cold cases surfaced\u2014simple alphanumeric cipher: A=1, B=2, and so on.\n\nS.M.H.H.U.\n\nNonsense, until she cross-referenced abandoned businesses in Halston's property records.\n\nSamuel\u2019s Mobile Home Hardware Utility. A tiny repair shop that had shuttered years ago, its letters still ghosting across a sagging storefront.\n\nThe lease belonged to a man who had never made the papers until now: Robert Hayes.\n\nNo criminal record. No complaints. No outstanding bills. His name surfaced once, buried in an old laptop repair registration. The name Anna Hayes appeared alongside his. Deceased. Along with two children: Emma and Samuel. A car crash, two years prior.\n\nMaria\u2019s pulse pounded in her ears. She pulled the warrant herself. No backup. No news vans. Just her badge and a city-issued key.\n\nThe house at the end of Chestnut Lane looked abandoned. The windows were boarded. Weeds clawed their way up the front steps. But inside, the air smelled like grief had been embalmed into the walls.\n\nShe moved slowly, her footsteps muffled against the dust. The kitchen was stripped bare. The living room was hollowed out, the couch gone, the tables missing. Only the nursery remained untouched.\n\nTwo beds\u2014one tiny racecar frame, one white-painted crib. Tiny shoes lined up neatly against the wall. Crayon drawings taped with careful hands: Emma holding a daisy. Samuel clutching a paper star.\n\nMaria\u2019s throat tightened. She knelt by the crib and saw it\u2014 A loose floorboard, cut precisely.\n\nUnderneath, she found a panel. And beneath the panel: photographs.\n\nHundreds of them.\n\nChildren on swings. Children walking home from school. A girl climbing the jungle gym. A boy waiting at a crosswalk. Her own niece, captured through the glass of a cafeteria window. Even herself\u2014photographed at her office window, late at night, unaware.\n\nOn the back of her photo, in red marker, someone had scrawled: \"Even the strong lose their children.\"\n\nMaria staggered back, the room tilting. Robert hadn\u2019t been lashing out blindly. He had been orchestrating this, piece by piece, grief by grief.\n\nHe had built a web.\n\nAnd now she was standing at its center.\n\n  \n\n\n# Chapter 8: The Broken Father\n\nThey found him at an abandoned grain silo just outside Halston, a skeleton of rust and rotted beams forgotten by progress. The frost clung to the metal, and the morning mist wrapped around the place like a shroud.\n\nInside, twenty children sat in a wide circle, drowsy, confused, but alive. Their hands were zip-tied loosely in front of them\u2014no bruises, no screaming. Only a heavy, drugged stillness. The air smelled of damp hay, gasoline, and old metal. Makeshift wiring coiled around the support beams, tangled like veins. Propane tanks sat beneath them, linked by a taut, quivering wire.\n\nAt the center stood Robert Hayes.\n\nHe was barefoot, his clothes coated in dust and ash, his hair hanging in ragged tufts over his eyes. In one hand, he clutched a worn photograph\u2014Emma dressed in an orange pumpkin costume, Samuel wearing a ghost sheet too big for him, chocolate smeared across his chin. The picture was bent, the edges soft from being touched too often.\n\nIn his other hand: the detonator.\n\nMaria Vance pushed past the barricades before anyone could stop her. She left her gun holstered. She left the shouting negotiators behind. She moved through the broken doorway into the silo\u2019s yawning cold, stepping carefully as if entering a church.\n\nRobert didn\u2019t look at her at first. His thumb brushed across Samuel\u2019s face in the photo, tender and trembling. When he finally raised his eyes, they were dark hollows rimmed with exhaustion\u2014not anger. Not even madness.\n\nJust grief.\n\n\"They laugh,\" Robert whispered, his voice rough, shredded from disuse. \"They still dance. They pretend it didn\u2019t happen.\"\n\nMaria stopped a few feet away, close enough to see the scars time had carved into him, the way his shoulders sagged under invisible weights.\n\n\"They didn\u2019t forget your children,\" she said softly. \"They forgot how to show it.\"\n\nRobert\u2019s lip trembled. His grip on the photograph tightened.\n\n\"Emma loved the rain,\" he said, as if to himself. \"Samuel... he hummed when he drew. No one remembers that.\"\n\n\"I do,\" Maria said.\n\nThe words cracked something inside him. His arms slackened. His body seemed to shrink. He looked down at the children\u2014their heads drooping in the cold\u2014and then, finally, he let the switch fall. It hit the dirt with a soft, hollow thud.\n\nRobert Hayes sank to his knees, folding into himself like a man kneeling at an altar. The officers moved in then\u2014slowly, carefully. No shouting. No violence. They cuffed him gently, almost reverently, as if recognizing they were not capturing a monster, but burying a broken father.\n\nAs they led him past Maria, he turned his head slightly. His voice, when it came, was low enough that only she could hear.\n\n\"I killed most of them,\" he said.\n\nNot all. Most.\n\nThe word cut deeper than any weapon.\n\nRobert hadn\u2019t acted alone.\n\nAnd Halston\u2019s nightmare was far from over.\n\n  \n\n\n# Chapter 9: Broken Threads\n\nTwo weeks after Robert Hayes was locked behind steel bars, another child died.\n\nA girl this time. Found floating face down in a retention pond behind Halston Middle School. Her sneakers were placed neatly beside her backpack, the zipper closed, her lunch still inside untouched. There were no signs of a struggle. No bruises. No cries for help. Just the stillness of the water swallowing another small life.\n\nMaria Vance stood in the rain at the pond\u2019s edge, her hands balled into fists in her coat pockets. She watched as divers hauled the girl\u2019s body out under a gray, broken sky. Every instinct in her screamed against the easy explanation being whispered around her: accident. Tragedy. Bad luck.\n\nBut Maria knew better.\n\nRobert Hayes was sealed away, his world reduced to a cell barely wide enough to stretch his arms. No visitors. No phone calls. No letters. And still\u2014the dying continued.\n\nSomeone else was carrying the flame now.\n\nShe returned to her office late that night and faced the wall of photographs and maps. Not as a detective. Not even as a protector. As a mourner. Someone who had lost, and who understood the ache that demanded action, no matter the cost.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t about Robert anymore. It was about everyone he had touched.\n\nShe didn\u2019t trace the victims this time. She traced the helpers.\n\nThe janitor who had locked the wrong fire exit during the Christmas pageant. The administrator who had quietly reassigned field trip groups. The bus driver who had closed the doors before the last child could climb aboard.\n\nOrdinary people. Invisible hands.\n\nMaria started digging.\n\nBrian Teller cracked first. She approached him without backup, without even her badge displayed. Just a quiet conversation at his kitchen table. She asked about the fire door. His fingers trembled around his coffee cup. She asked about the night of the pageant. He looked away.\n\nThen she mentioned his son. The boy with asthma.\n\nBrian broke like a rotted beam.\n\n\"They sent me a photo,\" he whispered. \"It showed a red circle around his chest... around his lungs.\"\n\nHe thought it was a prank at first. A cruel joke. He hadn\u2019t meant for anyone to get hurt. But Robert had known exactly where to cut.\n\nLinda Moore came next. She was waiting in the empty school office when Maria arrived, staring blankly at the playground beyond the frosted windows.\n\n\"I didn\u2019t want anyone to die,\" Linda said before Maria could even speak. \"They sent me a picture of my niece. Sleeping. In her bed. I just... I thought if I moved a name, it would be harmless.\"\n\nHarold Knox\u2014the bus driver\u2014took the longest. He didn\u2019t speak at all when Maria placed the envelope on the table between them. The photos. The nails. The hymn sheet with the red slash across it.\n\nHis hands shook. His shoulders sagged.\n\n\"I thought it would end,\" he said finally. \"I thought if I did what they asked, it would be over.\"\n\nMaria said nothing. She didn\u2019t need to. Because she understood something that terrified her.\n\nRobert Hayes hadn\u2019t needed to kill with his own hands.\n\nHe had taught grief how to move from person to person, like a contagion. He had taught fear how to whisper in the ears of desperate mothers, exhausted fathers, terrified guardians. He had taught ordinary people to become monsters in the name of love.\n\nThat night, Maria rebuilt her board one last time.\n\nNot a network of victims. But of mourners. Of conspirators. Of grief-stricken souls trapped between guilt and survival.\n\nShe traced red string from each accomplice, not to Robert, but to the acts they committed\u2014small acts, each just a hair\u2019s breadth from excusable, from forgivable, until they weren\u2019t.\n\nAt the center of the new web wasn\u2019t a man anymore. It was a wound.\n\nRobert Hayes had planted something that would not die with him. It had learned to spread.\n\nIt had learned to live.\n\nAnd it was still growing.\n\n\n\n# Chapter 10: Ashes in the Wind\n\nRobert Hayes was gone\u2014a hollow man locked away behind glass and concrete, his name recorded in a courthouse ledger no one cared to read twice. His trial was short, his sentencing swift. Life without parole. No outbursts. No apologies.\n\nAnd yet, Halston didn\u2019t recover.\n\nThe news cameras packed up and left. The vigil candles guttered and drowned in rain. The teddy bears and faded flowers piled at playground fences decayed beneath early snows. A few hollow speeches were made about resilience, about healing, about moving forward.\n\nBut fear had taken root deeper than grief ever could.\n\nChildren walked to school two by two, their hands clenched white-knuckled. Parents trailed behind them, glancing over their shoulders at every rustle of leaves, every parked car. Churches stayed half-empty, pews gathering dust. Christmas decorations blinked dimly behind barred windows. Laughter, when it came, sounded thin and brittle.\n\nMaria Vance saw it everywhere. In the way playgrounds sat deserted even on sunny days. In the way neighbors no longer trusted each other with their children. In the way hope had been packed away with the last of the holiday lights, perhaps forever.\n\nAnd still, the messages came.\n\nNo more crude threats. No more photographs. Just notes now\u2014typed, anonymous, slipped under doors or taped to mailbox flags. Simple messages.\n\n\"We\u2019re still here.\" \"She still dreams of water, doesn\u2019t she?\" \"You can\u2019t save them all.\"\n\nMaria sat alone most evenings at Miller Park, sipping cold coffee as the swings moved listlessly in the wind. She watched a rusted carousel creak in slow, aching turns. She watched the ghost of what Halston used to be.\n\nAnd she understood, bitterly, that Robert Hayes had won something no prison walls could take away. He had planted fear not in the hearts of individuals, but in the soil of the town itself. It bloomed every day, fed by memory and absence.\n\nHe had turned grief into a weapon. And he had taught others how to wield it.\n\nHalston wore its fear like an old, threadbare coat now\u2014something familiar and heavy and impossible to shed.\n\nMaria kept working. She kept pulling at threads, reopening old files, retracing old paths. She chased shadows. She chased half-remembered names. She chased whispers of whispers, knowing most of it would never lead anywhere clean.\n\nBecause Robert hadn\u2019t needed to give orders anymore.\n\nHe had shown them how.\n\nHow to wound without touching. How to kill without a sound. How to turn love itself into a noose.\n\nMaria walked the town at night sometimes, past shuttered shops, past homes with blacked-out windows, past a burned tool shed someone had once set ablaze just because it \u201clooked wrong.\u201d Every porch light flickering behind a curtain. Every father standing a little too long at the window after putting his children to bed. Every mother who locked every door twice, even during the day.\n\nThis was the new Halston.\n\nNot a place. A wound.\n\nThe final note came on a Tuesday morning. No envelope. Just a sheet of paper taped to Maria\u2019s front door, the words typed carefully, the ink barely dry.\n\n\"You can\u2019t save them all.\"\n\nMaria stood barefoot on the porch, the snow biting up through her skin, and stared at the note until the cold seeped into her bones. Then she struck a match, holding it to the paper until it curled black and drifted apart into the wind.\n\nAshes in the snow.\n\nShe watched the last of it vanish into the pale morning light.\n\nAnd whispered to the empty, listening town:\n\n\"Maybe not. But I can damn well try.\""},"9":{"title":"Skinwalker at my window","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kbqlc4\/skinwalker_at_my_window\/","flair":"Images & Comics","author":"FullStatistician7453","selftext":"So when I was 9 years old my dad was trying to sleep one night my mom was over at Dallas so it was just me my brother and my other brother and my dad alone so my dad trying to sleep one night he's here some thing scratching at the window like not technically out the window but it was that air conditioner filter I don't know what it's called but yeah anyways he hear somebody scratching at the air conditioner filter and he call me and my other brothers in the room so my dad starting to turn to record so as my older brother who is like 17 at the time so anyways both of them were recording and my dad had a kind of risky idea to go outside in the front yard to see what is scratching at the air conditioner thing and he saw a skinny tall creature and and when that creature saw my dad it jumped back into the forest like it was a frog my dad didn't have his phone flashlight but what he told me that that creature was hanging at the wall trying to scratch to get in and me and my brother whose name Micah who is like 12 and we saw our dad running back and then we followed him behind and then he told us what happened we got so scared and we fell asleep and then the next morning we came outside to see what happened and he saw that there was a scratch marks on the air conditioner thing okay anyways and my dad got a really large stick from nearby and then we went into his room and see what is the comparison and it was really similar but this thing was hanging from the this thing was hanging from the walls and so a few months later my dad was trying to sleep this time my mom was home this time and we hear the same scratching again so we again starting to come to the room and stir into record again and then this time my dad captured something horrifying I will save it until the end anyways and we start a step in the hallway and we saw a black long tentacle just scratched across the room we were terrified and oh I forgot to mention for a few months the whole keep on getting bigger and bigger and bigger until it comes back anyways we got our Jesus and bibles because we are Christians anyways we're trying to catch this demon out and then it worked and we all went back to sleep and ever since there was a cross and Bible next to that window but now I am 25 and I have a wife and kids oh I forgot so what my dad captured in that video was horrifying it was a glowing yellow eyes with something that looks like a pig and dog at the same time it was terrifying so I couldn't sleep and I finally went to sleep at 6:00 in the morning anyways I'm 25 now also here's a little bonus story so my wife and I were just sleeping we had window like across our bed and at 6:00 in the morning exactly at the DOT I woke up to catching out the window which sounded just like the one I had when I was nine I looked over at my wife Jillian and she was still sleeping so I looked over at the window and I can't describe it but it had yellow clone eyes a nose that look like a pig and dog at the same time but this time I saw a whole body it was pale and it was hanging from our walls I shook Jillian awake but when I showed her it was gone so she thought that I was just seeing things and just went back to sleep the next morning I went over at the side of the house where the window is and I saw some claw more at the walls and after that we move into another house and then we never saw that creature again so if you're seeing something paranormal like anything something like a demon like something that should be in this world pray use Jesus and God help you they are the one who died for sin he is stronger than demons so when you're seeing something paranormal or something that shouldn't be in this world do what I did pray use Jesus to help you and whatever you're seeing paranormal goes away so that's my story I have a bunch of other paranormal stories but this is a scariest one I experience yet so God bless you all stay safe and goodbye the end"},"10":{"title":"Driving at night","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kbiefj\/driving_at_night\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"shortstory1","selftext":"I hate driving alone at night and my head lights are broken, so it's pitch black and I'm driving on luck.

Some will not believe me, and others will call me crazy, but I felt it was real.\n\nIt all started one morning on October 17, 2015, just a few days before Halloween. My neighborhood was getting ready for that big day of candy, spooks, and crazy costumes. I was 11 years old at the time.\n\nAfter lunch, I decided to go turn on my computer and look for flash games to play, there were many, but I decided to play Halloween-themed games, among many of them there was one called \u201cHaunted House Scary Game\u201d.\n\nI opened it and waited for it to finish loading. When it finished loading, the game menu was displayed which had a cartoonish house on a mountain. While generic children's horror music played in the background I pressed the Start button and began to play.\n\nThe game started by displaying a text that read:\n\n\u201cIt's Halloween night, you go house to house trick or treating, there you find a house near the woods that is up a mountain, you decide to approach, the place looks abandoned, but clean for a person to live inside, you ring the doorbell and wait for someone to open the door and say the iconic Trick or Treat, but no one opens the door and mysteriously the door is unlocked.\u201d\n\nAfter that text, I pressed the \u201cContinue\u201d button and it showed the inside of a Point and Click style cartoon haunted house, there were doors leading to the kitchen, the living room, a dining room, and the basement (I needed a key), the stairs led to the second floor which had a room and other locked doors, as I investigated the room I found a key that when I grabbed it a text appeared that said \u201cBasement key obtained\u201d.\n\nAt that moment I decided to leave the room and go down the stairs to look for the basement door, I unlocked the basement and when I entered a musical box began to be heard while the basement door could be heard slamming shut.\n\nThe basement looked like a dungeon with bars and torches, there was a closet that when I entered there was a picture of a family that looked like a real picture, but had something that was strange, there was on the right side a kind of nun that had a distorted face and that when the mouse approached the face it seemed that it could be pressed, when clicking on it suddenly a scream was heard along with an image of a lady with white hair and decomposing skin without eyes opening abnormally her mouth without teeth was shown as a jumpscare all this while listening in the background a song that had only one word: \u201cQuick Solo Girl\u201d and it seemed to repeat that part of the song over and over again and cut off some parts, as it started to repeat an image of a woman in a forest was shown, all this while an old black and white footage of an abandoned house was shown then its interior was shown which had a person covered in a white blanket sitting convulsing while vomiting a black liquid, then a shot of the window near the person vomiting the same liquid was shown, then a closer shot of the person was shown and then another closer shot, after those shots a close up of his mouth vomiting the black liquid and his eyes being seen through a mask was shown.\n\nAfter that footage, the same image of the woman with no eyes was shown while the distorted scream of the same woman was heard until it played a red image that said, \u201cGame Over\u201d and then faded to black.\n\nI thought it was the end of the whole game until it started showing a recording of a possible hospital emergency, showing a man sitting on a gurney in front of doctors surrounding the gurney. The man's face was split in half and disfigured in its entirety, It looked like the doctors were trying to help him while chicken sounds were heard in the background... chicken sounds in an echoey place?\n\nAt the end of the recording, my computer shut down and I broke down crying from fear and decided to call my parents, they consoled me and then I turned on my computer to see if it did not do anything else when I finished turning on, everything seemed normal without any trace of changes and when I looked for the game again, I could not find it anywhere, no forums were talking about the game on the internet.\n\nYears later, now in 2025, I started to see a new trendy game: \u201cSprunki.\u201d The visual style of the game reminded me of the same Flash game I am talking about. If you see that game, open it with caution because it will leave you traumatized and unable to sleep peacefully, like I did as a child."},"12":{"title":"A creepypasta story about two soldiers who were in a bus","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kbg8qf\/a_creepypasta_story_about_two_soldiers_who_were\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Mammoth-Length-9090","selftext":"So I read this a few years back but I can't seem to remember the name anymore.

Everyone in Hemlock Creek knew the stories, whispers of shadows and unexplained chills, the tale of the family that vanished without a trace a century ago. Of course, I, ever the skeptic, found it all rather quaint. Until last night.\nI'd taken the dare, a foolish attempt to prove the townsfolk wrong. Armed with nothing but a flashlight and a bravado I didn't truly feel, I'd pushed open the creaking front door. The air inside was thick with the smell of dust and decay, a cloying sweetness underlying it that made the hairs on my arms stand on end. Moonlight filtered through the grimy windows, painting the decaying furniture in ghostly hues.\nEach step echoed unnervingly in the silence. Cobwebs brushed my face like phantom fingers, and the floorboards groaned beneath my weight as if the house itself was sighing. I told myself it was just the wind, just my imagination playing tricks.\nThen I heard it. A faint whisper, like someone speaking just beyond the edge of hearing. It seemed to come from upstairs. My heart hammered against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat in the oppressive stillness. Logic screamed at me to leave, to run back to the safety of the town, but a morbid curiosity, a chilling need to know, rooted me to the spot.\nSlowly, hesitantly, I started up the grand staircase, each step a monumental effort. The whispering grew slightly louder, a sibilant murmur I couldn't quite decipher. The air grew colder, a bone-deep chill that no draft could explain.\nI reached the landing. A long, dark hallway stretched before me, doors lining either side like silent sentinels. The whispering seemed to be coming from the last room on the left. My hand trembled as I reached for the doorknob. It was ice cold.\nWith a deep breath, I pushed the door open. The room was bathed in an eerie moonlight, illuminating a single rocking chair gently swaying in the center. But there was no one in it. The whispering stopped.\nRelief washed over me, quickly followed by a fresh wave of unease. The chair was moving on its own.\nSuddenly, the temperature plummeted. I could see my breath misting in the air. A shadow flickered in the corner of my eye. I spun around, my flashlight beam cutting through the darkness. Nothing.\nThen, the whispering started again, closer this time, right behind me. I whipped around, but still, nothing. A cold breath brushed the back of my neck.\nPanic seized me. I stumbled backward, tripping over something on the floor. I scrambled to my feet, my flashlight shaking in my hand. The rocking chair was now facing me, still swaying. And in its seat, a faint, translucent figure began to coalesce.\nIts eyes were dark, empty sockets that seemed to pierce right through me. A silent scream built in my throat. I wanted to run, but my legs felt like lead. The figure raised a spectral hand, and the whispering intensified, becoming a chorus of mournful voices.\nI don't remember how I got out of that house. All I recall is the frantic pounding of my feet on the wooden stairs, the desperate gasps for air, the feeling of being chased by something unseen, something malevolent.\nI haven't been back to the old house on the hill. And I never will. The whispers still echo in my nightmares, a chilling reminder that some stories are more than just tales. Some shadows are real. And some houses never truly let their secrets go.\n"},"14":{"title":"A creepypasta that will leave you saying \"dawg... what?\" No plot, just confusion","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kb7zkf\/a_creepypasta_that_will_leave_you_saying_dawg\/","flair":"Trollpasta Story","author":"Impressive_Pool2385","selftext":"\"SONIC.EXE.RED.TOENAIL_FINAL_FINAL_REAL.DOCX\"\n\nI was just trying to find a ROM of Knuckles\u2019 Chaotix, something to relive the good old days.

I unplugged the whole PC. The screen stayed on and showed Tails crying into a mirror that reflected me, but older, with less hair and a shirt that said \u201cYou Did This.\u201d\n\nThen the credits rolled.

I want to share something personal\u2014wrapped in a horror story called The Inheritance.\n\nThis piece is fiction, but it\u2019s born from something real. My mother was abused as a child by someone who should have protected her. That trauma didn\u2019t end with her. I was raised in the shadow of what he did\u2014shaped by her pain, her fear, and the ripple effect of surviving something no one should have to.\n\nThe Inheritance explores what happens when silence is passed down like a family heirloom. When pain is inherited. When someone finally says, \u201cNo more.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s dark. It\u2019s emotional. And yeah\u2014it\u2019s meant to hurt a little. But if you\u2019ve lived with trauma, or loved someone who has, maybe it\u2019ll say something that\u2019s been hard to put into words.\n\nThanks for reading. And to survivors and their children: you\u2019re not alone.\n\nThe Inheritance \n\nHe wakes in the dark.\n\nHis mouth is dry, and there\u2019s a weight on his chest\u2014not just fear, but something real. Restraints. Ropes, maybe leather. Ankles and wrists bound to a cold metal chair. His head lolls forward, neck stiff. A faint humming sound surrounds him\u2014constant and low, like a machine in the walls.\n\nThen a click. A lamp flickers on overhead. Pale light spills into the room\u2014a concrete basement, empty except for a folding table, a camera bolted into the far corner, and the chair he\u2019s tied to.\n\nHe starts to struggle, breath picking up.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t bother.\u201d\n\nThe voice is calm. Male. Tired.\n\nAcross from him, seated quietly in a padded office chair, is a man with sallow skin, thin frame, and hollow eyes. Late thirties, maybe. There\u2019s an oxygen tank beside him, plastic tubing trailing into his nose. A handheld remote lies across his lap.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re safe,\u201d the man says. \u201cFor now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d the bound man croaks, throat like sandpaper.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in my basement. Soundproofed. Secure. No one can hear you, and no one\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\nFear flickers behind the man\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve made a mistake\u2014I don\u2019t know who you are\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will.\u201d\n\nThe man presses a button on the remote. A low hum stops\u2014the sound of a space heater, maybe\u2014and silence sharpens the air.\n\nThe man breathes, slow and careful.\n\n\u201cYou molested my mother when she was a child. You raped her. You stripped away her innocence and stitched shame in its place. You made her believe it was her fault. That no one would believe her. That no one would care.\u201d\n\nHe lets the words sit. The other man\u2019s mouth twitches.\n\n\u201cThat was decades ago,\u201d he rasps, eyes darting toward the door.\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d the man says. \u201cDecades for you to live your life. Get married. Have kids. Grandkids. All while she couldn\u2019t be touched without flinching. Couldn\u2019t be held without shaking.\u201d\n\nHe leans forward now, voice softening.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m what\u2019s left of her. The piece that came after. I grew up with a mother who barely existed. Who couldn\u2019t love without bleeding for it. And I spent every year trying to patch holes you left behind.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d the bound man starts, but stops. He sees something in the man\u2019s eyes. Something absolute. Hopeless.\n\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking. Denial. Confusion. Maybe even pity,\u201d the man says. \u201cBut it won\u2019t help you here.\u201d\n\nHe points to the blinking red light on the camera.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to spend the rest of your life in this room. That camera feeds to an encrypted server. My attorney and two friends have the password. If I die, they take over. They\u2019ve been instructed not to intervene. Only to observe.\u201d\n\nThe bound man starts to shake. \u201cThis is illegal. It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s torture\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what she lived with,\u201d the man cuts in. \u201cEvery day. In her mind. In her nightmares. I\u2019m giving you a fraction of that.\u201d\n\nHe stands, revealing how frail he truly is. His hand trembles as he adjusts the oxygen line.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have much longer. Cancer. Final stage. It\u2019s in my bones now. Breathing hurts. Moving hurts. But this\u2026 this is what I had to do before I go.\u201d\n\nHe begins pacing, dragging the oxygen tank behind him like an anchor.\n\n\u201cI could\u2019ve killed you. Quick. Easy. But that\u2019s not what this is about. It\u2019s not revenge. It\u2019s balance. You left poison in my blood. My childhood was smoke and screaming. My mother would stare at walls for hours. She never talked about you. But I saw it. Every time she flinched when I walked in a room. Every time she apologized for crying.\u201d\n\nThe bound man starts sobbing now, a pitiful, wheezing sound.\n\n\u201cI was just a kid,\u201d he says. \u201cI was sick\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were a predator,\u201d the man snaps, stepping forward. \u201cYou chose her. You shaped her. And through her, you shaped me.\u201d\n\nHe kneels now, slowly, painfully, and looks into the man\u2019s eyes.\n\n\u201cYou gave me this inheritance. Now I\u2019m giving it back.\u201d\n\nSilence thickens. Only the faint hiss of the oxygen tank remains.\n\nAfter a moment, the man rises again and walks to the stairs.\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d the bound man says. \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me here. I\u2019ll die. I\u2019ll go mad\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be alone,\u201d the man says, pausing at the base of the steps. \u201cYou\u2019ll have your memories. That\u2019s what she had, too.\u201d\n\nHe climbs the steps slowly. At the top, he hesitates.\n\n\u201cYou once told her it would be your little secret. Now it really is.\u201d\n\nThe door shuts.\n\nDarkness returns.\n\nThe bound man screams until his throat gives out. No one comes.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nHe dies two days later.\n\nPeacefully. Alone.\n\nIn the living room upstairs, slouched on the couch with a blanket over his legs and an oxygen mask still strapped to his face. The TV glows with static. A legal envelope sits on the coffee table beside an empty glass of water and a single photograph of a woman smiling faintly, decades before she forgot how.\n\nWhen the authorities arrive\u2014days later, flagged by a friend checking on the monitoring server\u2014they find the basement just as described in the man\u2019s instructions. Food trays pushed toward the door. A bucket for waste. A broken man, weeping into the corner, muttering nonsense and prayers and memories no one wants to hear.\n\nBut above it all, scrawled across the wall in faded black marker, just above the camera, are five simple words:\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t get away with it.\u201d\n\nAnd for the first time in his life, the son rested easy."},"19":{"title":"My neighbor told me a story about a teenager who abducts animals","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1karpeq\/my_neighbor_told_me_a_story_about_a_teenager_who\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"tvojamamaimadildo","selftext":"There is a story circulating in my hometown of Novouralsk (\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043b\u042c\u0441\u043a) in Russia about a teenager who committed experiments with various animals. A few days ago, my neighbors lost their pet dog. They were telling everybody in the neighborhood about the situation and so they told me to contact them if I were to find out some information about the dog. We talked for a bit and the father said that he remembers a kid who was around in the early 2000s, who supposedly used to abduct different animals and torture them, putting them up to some kind of experiment.He would take animals, such as cats, dogs or birds and try to converge them into one mutant. A woman who lives here claims that she saw him \u201cplaying\u201d with his creation, some kind of cat with a beak. The father seemed to be joking about it, but it stuck with me. I tried not to give it much thought, but I also had a cat at home and was scared that something would happen to it. The man said that the teenage boy from the story disappeared from the town, never to be seen again. I wouldn\u2019t be writing this right now if something didn\u2019t happen yesterday.

You might think me wrong to do so, but when I explain what she did to me in 1998, you might feel differently.\n\nThe 90s were a brutal time to be a kid. Bullying wasn\u2019t just common\u2014it was practically a rite of passage. Teachers often turned a blind eye, and schools rarely intervened unless someone ended up in the hospital.\n\nI remember reading about Kelly Yeomans in 1997\u2014a 13-year-old girl from Derby, England, who took her own life after relentless bullying. Her parents had complained to the school multiple times, but nothing changed. Kids would gather outside her house, throwing food and shouting insults. Eventually, she overdosed on painkillers.  \n\nThen there was Reena Virk in Canada. In 1997, she was just 14 when a group of teenagers beat her and left her to drown. She\u2019d been bullied for years, targeted for her weight and background. Her death became a national tragedy. \n\nI bring this up because I want you to understand the environment we were in. Bullying wasn\u2019t just overlooked\u2014it was ingrained in the culture. And Charlotte? She thrived in it.\n\nOne day in 1998, I saw a piece of paper being passed around the classroom.\nIt started at the back row and made its way forward, kids giggling, heads bent low like they were sharing some inside joke.\n\nA girl I was friendly with\u2014her name was Rose\u2014caught my eye. She looked sheepish, guilty. She mouthed something like sorry as it reached my desk.\n\nI didn\u2019t wait. I snatched the paper out of her hands before she could say anything else.\n\nIt was a poll.\n\nIn block letters at the top it said:\n\n\u201cShould [my name] kill herself?\u201d\n\nUnderneath, two columns.\nYes.\nNo.\n\nI counted.\nFourteen tallies under \u201cYes.\u201d\nNone under \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nEnd of part 1.\nI need to take a break here.\nI promise when I continue the supernaturally horrific parts of my story will come to life.\nI posted this to no sleep but was removed for what reason I don\u2019t know\u2026 they told me to post it to a more appropriate community so I\u2019m putting it here.

Some will not believe me, and others will call me crazy, but I felt it was real.\n\n\n\nIt all started one morning on October 17, 2015, just a few days before Halloween. My neighborhood was preparing for that big day of candy, spooks, and crazy costumes. I was 11 years old at the time.\n\n\n\nAfter lunch, I decided to turn on my computer and look for flash games to play. There were many, but I decided to play Halloween-themed games. Among many of them, there was one called \u201cHaunted House Scary Game.\u201d\n\n\n\nI opened it and waited for it to finish loading. When it finished loading, the game menu was displayed which had a cartoonish house on a mountain. While generic children's horror music played in the background I pressed the Start button and began to play.\n\n\n\nThe game started by displaying a text that read: \n\n\n\n\u201cIt's Halloween night, you go house to house trick or treating, there you find a house near the woods that is up a mountain, you decide to approach, the place looks abandoned, but clean for a person to live inside, you ring the doorbell and wait for someone to open the door and say the iconic Trick or Treat, but no one opens the door and mysteriously the door is unlocked.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter that text, I pressed the \u201cContinue\u201d button and it showed the inside of a Point and Click style cartoon haunted house, there were doors leading to the kitchen, the living room, a dining room, and the basement (I needed a key), the stairs led to the second floor which had a room and other locked doors, as I investigated the room I found a key that when I grabbed it a text appeared that said \u201cBasement key obtained\u201d.\n\n\n\nAt that moment I decided to leave the room and go down the stairs to look for the basement door, I unlocked the basement and when I entered a musical box began to be heard while the basement door could be heard slamming shut, the basement looked like a dungeon with bars and torches, there was a closet that when I entered there was a picture of a family that looked like a real picture, but had something that was strange, there was on the right side a kind of nun that had a distorted face and that when the mouse approached the face it seemed that it could be pressed, when clicking on it suddenly a scream was heard along with an image of a lady with white hair and decomposing skin without eyes opening abnormally her mouth without teeth was shown as a jumpscare all this while listening in the background a song that had only one word: \u201cQuick Solo Girl\u201d and it seemed to repeat that part of the song over and over again and cut off some parts, as it started to repeat an image of a woman in a forest was shown, all this while an old black and white footage of an abandoned house was shown then its interior was shown which had a person covered in a white blanket sitting convulsing while vomiting a black liquid, then a shot of the window near the person vomiting the same liquid was shown, then a closer shot of the person was shown and then another closer shot, after those shots a close up of his mouth vomiting the black liquid and his eyes being seen through a mask was shown.\n\n\n\nAfter that footage, the same image of the woman with no eyes was shown while the distorted scream of the same woman was heard until it played a red image that said, \u201cGame Over\u201d and then faded to black.\n\n\n\nI thought it was the end of the whole game until it started showing a recording of a possible hospital emergency showing a man sitting on a gurney in front of doctors surrounding the gurney. The man's face was split in half and disfigured in its entirety, it looked like the doctors were trying to help him while chicken sounds were heard in the background... chicken sounds in an echoey place?\n\n\n\nAt the end of the recording, my computer shut down and I broke down crying from fear and decided to call my parents, they consoled me and then I turned on my computer to see if it did not do anything else when I finished turning on, everything seemed normal without any trace of changes and when I looked for the game again, I could not find it anywhere, there were no forums talking about the game on the internet. \n\n\n\nYears later, now in 2025, I started to see a new trendy game: \u201cSprunki\u201d The visual style of the game, reminded me of the same Flash game I am talking about. If you see that game, open it with caution because it will leave you traumatized and unable to sleep peacefully like I did as a child."},"24":{"title":"Where can I find 'I eat pasta for breakfast' PLEASE HELP","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kb2kck\/where_can_i_find_i_eat_pasta_for_breakfast_please\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"clobug42","selftext":"I have found the point where Lazari is hugging her sister.

Old factories, office spaces, and department stores are all great, but my favorite type of abandoned buildings are asylums. The look and, for lack of a better word, aura of them\u2014their decrepitude mixed with their dark history\u2014really does it for me.\n\nUrban exploration is my favorite pastime, so much so that when I\u2019m not doing it, I consume as much content about it as I possibly can. Everyone in this community knows Exploring with Josh, but I also love channels like URBEX HILL and ActionAdventureTwins. I\u2019ve even watched videos in languages I don\u2019t understand just to see new environments.\n\nBut I\u2019m getting sidetracked.\n\nI recently came across an unsolved missing persons case with an urbex twist. There\u2019s an abandoned asylum in Rochester, New York, known as The Terrence Building\u2014a 16-story monster of a building. It was officially closed in 1995 due to \u201ca broader closure of several buildings at the now-named Rochester Psychiatric Center, due to declining patient populations and a shift towards newer, smaller facilities,\u201d according to Google. But in reality, it was most likely shut down due to multiple allegations of patient abuse\u2014reports of individuals being labeled \u201clost causes\u201d and deemed \u201cimpossible to reintegrate into society.\u201d They treated those people like prisoners.\n\nI\u2019m from Rochester and have explored a lot in the area\u2014the old Kodak buildings, the Beech-Nut factory, the abandoned parts beneath the Rundel Library\u2014but never this place. So, I did the only thing that seemed logical: I went to Reddit and started asking questions.\n\nFirst, I posted in r\/Rochester to see if anyone knew about the case. No reply. Then I tried r\/urbanexploration and r\/Urbex. Still nothing. But when I asked in r\/abandoned, I got something interesting. A user named RustySteele DMed me a video file and nothing else. No \u201chi\u201d or \u201chello\u201d\u2014just the file.\n\nI downloaded it, watched it, and now I\u2019ve decided to relay the important information here.\n\nI\u2019ll do my best to provide as much detail as I feel is necessary. The video shows a group of four individuals\u201422-year-old Vincent Brown, 16-year-old Aiden Caster, 21-year-old Maxine Caster, and the person recording, 22-year-old Brayden Steele. The footage is dated November 21st, 2022. From what I understand, this recording is the last known trace of their whereabouts.\n\nThe footage begins with the group standing outside the building\u2019s main entrance while Brayden gives his channel intro.\n\n\n\n(B) \"Hello, hello, hello, YouTube! You are exploring with Brayden, and today we are checking out one of Rochester\u2019s most infamous abandoned buildings\u2014Terrence Tower! I'm joined today by the gang as usual: Vinny, Aiden, and Maxine.\"\n\n(V) \"What\u2019s goodie, YouTuuuuube?\"\n\n(A) \"What's up, guys!\"\n\nMaxine doesn\u2019t say anything and just waves to the camera.\n\n(B) \"I don\u2019t know much about this place, but I do know there\u2019s one very specific room we have to check out... the Choke Room. From what I understand, it was used to torture patients that the staff considered \u2018misbehaving,\u2019 which was just one of many reasons this place was shut down, I\u2019d assume. Anyway, guys, let's get exploring!\"\n\n\n\n\nThe first handful of minutes are rather boring. The group makes their way through the building, looking at all the graffiti and destruction caused by time and vandals. While watching, it became very apparent that Aiden did not want to be there. Neither did Vincent\u2014but for different reasons. Aiden seemed unsettled by the whole thing, while Vincent was dismissive of the entire ordeal.\n\n(B) \"Man, guys, this place is freaky. There are motivational\u2014and I say that very loosely\u2014quotes on the wall over here that say, \u2018Today is the first day of the rest of your life.\u2019 \u2018Watch your attitude. It\u2019s the first thing people notice about you.\u2019 That last one feels more like a warning than anything.\"\n\n(A) \"Yeah, dude, super freaky. Being locked up in a place like this, being tortured and stuff... man, I couldn't imagine.\"\n\n(V) \"Don\u2019t be such a pussy. It\u2019s not like they picked people off the street\u2014only lunatics and crazies were locked up here. Better here than out with us.\"\n\n(M) \"You're such a dick, Vinny. This place has seen so much suffering and carries so much negative energy\u2014I\u2019d watch what you say.\"\n\n(B) \"Stop arguing, guys. We have 16 floors to get through, and I think we should start with... the morgue!\"\n\n\n\n\nThe group starts walking toward the morgue, and this is when the first interesting thing happens. As they walk, they all start gagging and coughing.\n\n(B) \"Holy shit, this hall stinks. You guys smell that?\"\n\n(A) \"It smells like, like\u2014\"\n\n(M) \"Rotting meat.\"\n\nVincent is coughing and gagging so hard that he\u2019s very clearly about to vomit.\n\n(V) \"Jesus Christ.\"\n\n(B) \"This place has been closed since\u2014\"\n\nBrayden walks over to a counter with leftover pill and medicine bottles sprawled out.\n\n(B) \"1995. But this smell is fresh. It smells like fresh death. This is some weird shit, guys.\"\n\nVincent walks over to the wall of refrigeration units and reaches for one that\u2019s partially ajar. At this point, I was leaning into my monitor.\n\n(V) \"The smell seems like it's coming from here.\"\n\nWhen Vincent opens it, he immediately bends over, looking like he's going to vomit.\n\n(M) \"There's... nothing in there. But the smell is definitely coming from that unit. I don\u2019t like this at all, guys.\"\n\n(A) \"Can we please get out of this room? I can\u2019t stand the smell anymore.\"\n\n(B) \"Vinny, you good, man? Or is this all too much for your little baby stomach?\"\n\nThis part was actually pretty funny\u2014Brayden starts laughing and gagging while Vinny is still recovering from almost puking.\n\n(V) \"I'm fine. Just wasn\u2019t expecting the smell to be so pungent. Let\u2019s keep moving.\"\n\n(M) \"You sure you\u2019re okay, babe?\"\n\n(V) \"I said I\u2019m fine. I just want to leave this room.\"\n\nAfter that, the group starts to leave until the second strange thing happens.\n\n(A) \"Hey guys, did you hear that? I swear I just heard something. Like... a moan. Or a sigh. I don\u2019t know, but it definitely sounded like a person.\"\n\n(B) \"Nah, man, I didn\u2019t hear anything. Maxine, Vinny, did you?\"\n\n(V) \"I didn't hear shit. He\u2019s just tryna scare us. It\u2019s not gonna work, dork.\"\n\nMaxine smacks Vincent on the back of his head so hard I thought he was gonna fall over.\n\n(M) \"I told you to stop being a douche. If Aiden says he heard something, then he heard something. Let\u2019s just keep our ears open and keep moving. I can\u2019t handle this stench anymore.\"\n\nAfter that, there are several more minutes of wandering. Brayden shows countless empty rooms\u2014very small rooms that looked more like cells, fitting. But after the wandering, they arrive at what used to be the cafeteria.\n\nNow this is where things start to change. Braydens attitude more or less takes a 180. Before he wasn't dissimilar to your run of the mill Youtuber. But once they got to the cafe something changed.\n\n(B) \"Alright, gang, looks like we made it into the cafe, and it's\u2014what was that?  \"\n\n(M) \" what was what B? I didn't hear anything.\"\n\n(B) \" I can still hear it. It sounds like whispering, Max.\"\n\n(M) \u201c Well i don't hear anything.\"\n\n(B) \u201c It sounds like school lunch. It's just voices.\u201d \n\n(V) \u201cNah man I don't hear anything either.\u201d\n\nAll four of them are still in frame just standing, but the camera is shaking. Very aggressively, and I could hear Brayden hyperventilating. Then he just stops, he stops shaking, he stops breathing heavily. The other 3 turn to look at him and they all have a concerned look on their faces. And not a normal concern it was a more horrified concern, but no one said anything.\n\nAfter that, Vincent heads off-screen along with Maxine, while Brayden continues filming with Aiden in frame. Aiden looks absolutely terrified, who wouldn't be after that. As Vincent and Maxines voices grow distant and indistinguishable, Aiden finally says something.\n\n(A) \u201c B-Brayden are you okay? You're as white as a ghost.\u201d\n\n(B) \u201cI don't know. I don't know. I think so, where's Vinny and Max?\u201d\n\n(A) \u201cThey walked into the kitchen i think?\u201d\n\n(B) \u201c Well let's go. I don't want to be in This room any longer than I have to be.\u201d \n\nAiden and Brayden head Into the kitchen, The voices of Vincent and Maxine start to become clearer as they seem to be in mid conversation. Brayden stops right before The kitchen door and just stands behind it. He halts Aiden from going in and shushes him.\n\n(M) \u201cI knew it! I knew there was something wrong here, what the fuck just happened to B?\u201d \n\n(V) \u201c Honestly I don't believe it. He's doing all this for his stupid video that nobody is going to watch. He's scaring you and Aiden and I don't think it's funny at all.\u201d\n\n(M) \u201cDon't say that. I don't think B would go this far for a stupid video. What I do think is that we need to get out of here\u201d\n\nAt this point, Brayden starts to breathe heavily again and starts muttering to himself. I can't make out what he's saying but he clearly is upset at what he's hearing. He shoves the camera into Aidens hands and barges into the kitchen.\n\n(B) \u201c You guys think I'm making it up? I know what the fuck is heard. It's not just for some \u2018stupid\u2019 video. Fuck you guys.\u201d\n\n(M) \u201cNo B we didn't-\u201d\n\nBrayden storms out of the kitchen while Maxine tries pleading her case. This is the last time Brayden is shown on camera. Vincent, Maxine and our new camera man Aiden are left speechless. Aiden sets the camera down and walks up to Maxine.\n\nEnd of part one.\n"},"32":{"title":"The Last Save File","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kart1s\/the_last_save_file\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Ancient_Baseball_752","selftext":"I used to think nothing could be worse than losing my dad. Then I found his old N64 in the attic.\n\n\n\nIt was boxed up with his other stuff \u2013 you know, the things mom couldn't bear to look at after the accident. The console was dusty, but the golden Ocarina of Time cartridge still gleamed like it was fresh from the store. Dad and I used to play it together every Sunday. He'd help me through the Water Temple, and I'd pretend to be scared of ReDeads just so he'd cover my eyes.\n\n\n\nI hooked it up to my TV that night, more out of nostalgia than anything else. The startup screen flickered to life, that familiar melody filling my room. But something was off. Instead of the usual three save files, there was only one. \"PHANTOM\" it read, with 72 hours played.\n\n\n\nThat wasn't right. Dad always named his file \"DAD,\" and I was \"KIDDO.\" We never had a file named \"PHANTOM.\"\n\n\n\nI selected it anyway. The game loaded straight into the Shadow Temple, but everything was... wrong. The textures were distorted, stretched like faces in a funhouse mirror. The background music played in reverse, a discordant mess of notes that made my skin crawl.\n\n\n\nLink stood motionless in the center of the room, facing away from the camera. I tried moving him, but he wouldn't respond. After a few seconds, he slowly turned around on his own.\n\n\n\nHis face was my dad's.\n\n\n\nNot some crude pixel art or a glitchy texture \u2013 it was an actual photograph of my father's face, mapped perfectly onto Link's model. The same warm smile he had in the last photo taken before the crash.\n\n\n\nThe screen went black. When it came back, Link \u2013 or whatever it was \u2013 stood in Ganon's Castle. But instead of Phantom Ganon floating there, it was a twisted, polygonal version of the semi-truck that had killed my father. The model glitched and contorted, its headlights burning like evil eyes.\n\n\n\nA text box appeared: \"Some phantoms don't stay in their paintings, kiddo.\"\n\n\n\nI hit the power button, but the game kept running. Link\/Dad turned to face the screen again, reaching out as if trying to touch me through the glass. The truck-phantom swooped closer, its textures corrupting more with each pass.\n\n\n\nAnother text box: \"I'm still trying to save you.\"\n\n\n\nThat's when I noticed the date on the save file: 72 hours played. The exact amount of time between dad's accident and when they turned off his life support.\n\n\n\nI don't know how long I sat there crying before I finally unplugged the console. The next morning, the N64 was gone from where I'd left it. The box in the attic was empty too, except for a single piece of paper \u2013 a crayon drawing I'd made of Dad and me playing Zelda together.\n\n\n\nSometimes late at night, I hear the reversed Shadow Temple music drifting up from downstairs. I never go to check, but I know what I'd find: Dad, still trying to beat that last phantom, still trying to protect me.\n\n\n\nSome games don't end when you turn them off. Some saves can't be overwritten. And some phantoms... some phantoms just want one more Sunday with their kid."},"33":{"title":"The Grinder\u2019s Game","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kavp93\/the_grinders_game\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"TacticalJock15","selftext":"Coach Mackey was a legend.\nEveryone in the bodybuilding world knew his name \u2014 a kingmaker who could turn any rookie into a god.\n\nSo when he personally invited me and a few others to his new \u201celite camp,\u201d we didn\u2019t even ask questions.\nWe packed our bags, signed the waivers, and showed up.\n\nThe camp was deep in the woods.\nNo cell service.\nNo outside contact.\nJust lifting, eating, and grinding \u2014 as Mackey said \u2014 \u201cuntil there\u2019s nothing left but the strongest version of you.\u201d\n\nAt first it was brutal, but manageable.\nThen guys started disappearing.\n\nFirst Marcus.\nWent for a \u201clate-night cardio session\u201d and never came back.\nCoach said he washed out.\nWeak.\n\nThen Jake.\nLast I saw, he was gasping after a brutal squat set.\nCoach sent him to \u201crehab.\u201d\nWe never saw him again.\n\nAt night, I started hearing noises.\nDragging.\nScreams cut off too fast.\nA low, constant humming in the distance, like some huge machine chewing through bone.\n\nRyan tried to leave.\nPacked a bag and sprinted down the dirt road.\nCoach caught him before he hit the trees.\n\nI watched from my window as Coach carried Ryan\u2019s body \u2014 limp, bloody, twitching \u2014 straight into the old barn.\n\nThe next morning, Ryan\u2019s bunk was stripped clean.\nNo goodbye.\nNo explanation.\nJust silence.\n\nThat\u2019s when I understood.\nCoach wasn\u2019t training us.\nHe was selecting us.\nGrading the meat.\nChoosing which ones were ripe for processing.\n\nI tried to hide.\nSkipped meals.\nPretended to be injured.\n\nBut tonight, Coach knocked on my cabin door.\n\n\u201cYour turn,\u201d he said.\n\nBehind him, the barn doors were swinging open.\nInside, massive industrial meat grinders stood waiting, their blades still slick and red.\nHooks dangled from the ceiling, swaying slightly, each one dripping a slow, steady line of blood onto the concrete floor.\n\nAnd hanging above the grinders were the bodies \u2014 or what was left of them.\n\nMuscle torn from bone.\nTanned, veiny arms reduced to ribbons.\nHuge chests and legs packed like sides of beef, waiting to be fed into the machines.\n\nI saw Marcus\u2019s face for a second.\nStill beautiful.\nStill strong.\nFrozen in silent agony as his shredded torso slipped down into the grinder\u2019s open mouth.\n\nThe machine roared to life.\nBone snapped like twigs.\nFlesh twisted and folded as the grinders swallowed him whole, spraying red mist across the walls.\n\nA thick, pink sludge oozed out the other side, pouring into black vacuum-sealed bags stacked neatly on pallets marked EXPORT QUALITY.\n\nCoach smiled wide.\n\u201cBig boys make the best meat,\u201d he said.\n\u201cReal tender.

Suddenly my neck is aching. Ugh...Guess I need to take a break. So, I walk to the living room, sit on the couch, turn the TV on and start to browse channels, especially the cartoon ones because those Hindi dramas...aren't my cup of coffee. Suddenly I stumble into animax. What? I thought that channel was closed long ago. I guess they bought it back... So, I shake it off and start to watch it. Okay, just an random anime going on... I keep watching it. Then suddenly, with a glitch... I see that the next show is My Hero Academia OVA. Wait...why does the design looks like a fanmade...The OVA name...\"My Hero Academia: A Burned Dream\"? What kind of name is this?! Then suddenly the music is not really like the usual openings. It keeps changing the tempo in an ominous way. It doesn't sound normal at all... \n\nAfter that off-tuned opening, I see Midoriya studying in the night, exactly like how I'm studying and\u2014 wait...why does this look like my room? It's not exactly the same,but the setup looks like mine. Then suddenly, he hears the rustle. I feel like the rustle is coming from my room. The screen is glitching as he's coming closer to the wardrobe. He sees a hoodie that he doesn't remember belonging. Then suddenly, he hears the whispers. Midoriya. I also can feel the whisper through my ears. I turn back and see nothing. Then I turn my head to the TV. He's back to study again. Then suddenly, the scene shifts into the school. Aizawa sees him. Aizawa's inner monologue is like \"why does he look familiar?\" Then he remembers the incident when Endeavor was the teacher instead of Aizawa. Aizawa was new back then. Endeavor happened to burn the training arena and apparently half of the students were taken away. Iida, Tsuyu, Sero, Shoji, Aoyama, Tokoyami, Satou, Hagakure and...Midoriya. He's shocked. Wait, how is Midoriya alive? \n\nThe scene cuts and shows him just wandering. Suddenly he stops by the old storage, which is so forgotten by everyone. Then his eyes go on a mirror. In the mirror, however, he saw nothing but a version of himself...his skin burned. His eyes are still determined, but it's saddened. It says, \"I couldn't save anyone, Izuku. I couldn't, I couldn't fulfill my dream.\" Midoriya gets scared.\n\n\"who are you? What are you doing here?\" \n\n\"I am you, from the other universe. Back then, when Endeavor was the teacher, he accidentally burned the training arena and half of us died. I-I could not save anyone.\" \n\nIt starts crying. I swear I clench my heart. Tears fall from my eyes. I want to hug Midoriya. \n\n\"You are living my dream.\" \n\nAnd then the scene ends. \n\nFull black. \n\nI don't know what actually happened to Midoriya.\n\nThen after a few seconds , the credit rolls. No music. Just texts scrolling up.

Possibly more notably a Forever Young one,\n\nBut have you ever looked up why they started remodeling the restaurants in the first place?\n\nThe first Forever Young designed store in the world popped up in Oak Brook, IL near their corporate headquarters back in June of 2005, That one is no longer there or in operation as the corporate headquarters have been relocated to downtown Chicago. That was just the beginning, however\n\nNow over the last 19-20 years, McDonald\u2019s has taken to remodeling or rebuilding almost every single restaurant in America. Most of you might even be asking yourself how long it\u2019s been since you last stepped foot in an old McDonald\u2019s, especially one that was built in the 70's or the 80's\n\nAsk anyone who\u2019s done some market research and you\u2019ll hear something strange. McDonald\u2019s loses money on the process. It\u2019s a fact. The new furniture isn\u2019t pulling new customers and the McCafe\u2019s can\u2019t sell coffee and bakery pastries that cheap, that expensive and turn a profit. Look at pricing of Dunkin, Starbucks and Tim Hortons locations and you\u2019ll see what I mean.\n\nStakeholders say they wanted a more adult vibe for the restaurant. \u201cA classier look for a classier America.\u201d\n\nWrong answer. Google it right now: what\u2019s McDonald\u2019s target age group? It\u2019s children and teens. It always has been since Ronald McDonald, their clown mascot, was created.\n\nSo then why did they start all these remodels? Why would one of the largest corporations in America spend over 1$ grand on a terrible marketing strategy?  \nThat\u2019s where things get interesting.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the play places.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nIf you can remember, almost no two play places at McDonald\u2019s were identical. Some of them were really fun. I know I had a few favorites.\n\nStakeholders say they wanted a more adult vibe for the restaurant. \u201cA classier look for a classier America.\u201d\n\nWrong answer. Google it right now: what\u2019s McDonald\u2019s target age group? It\u2019s children and teens. It always has been.\n\nSo then why did they start all these remodels? Why would one of the largest corporations in America spend over 1 billion on a terrible marketing strategy?  \nThat\u2019s where things get interesting.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the play places.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nIf you can remember, almost no two play places at McDonald\u2019s were identical. Some of them were really fun. I know I had a few favorites.\n\nWell some of them were also really dangerous. The first gem I could find was a carousel play place in Aina Haina, Hawaii (the first one in Hawaii) back in the early 80\u2019s that got shut down and taken out mere a decade after opening in the mid-90s. Little information was given about why they closed and removed the original play area. That one had been replaced by a more safer play place that has since had been removed with the restaraunt's rebuild in early 2010's.\n\nIf you find the right journalists in Hawaii though, you just might be able to read an article that didn\u2019t make it to print.\n\nChildren would play on the merry-go-round in ways they weren\u2019t supposed to, you see. They\u2019re kids, so of course they would. Well one day a few kids managed to crawl underneath the thing but then they never made it back out.\n\nThe whole incident was so heavily guarded by McDonald\u2019s PR, you\u2019d be troubled to find a single person that was even there that whole afternoon. The only witness anyone could find had this to say:\n\n\u201cWhen they went under, a few parents started calling for help. Then something happened to the lights. The carousel kept getting brighter and the music was deafening. I ran out of the building when the machine started to smoke, but I looked back through the window to see if the kids were alright and the employees were just standing there behind the registers! They looked like they were still waiting for customers!\u201d\n\nWeirder and weirder stories pick up from there through the years. Reports of children sinking into ball pits that should only be a foot deep. Mothers searching play tubes for their kids, only to find a lonely pair of shoes.\n\nBut the play places held a mere fraction of the incidents.\n\nBack in 1994 in Squamish, British Columbia, there was a business man of his 40\u2019s who went into a McDonald\u2019s restroom and remained there for seven hours. Patrons and employees noted that he refused to leave the furthest back stall.\n\nThe police were finally called and they managed to break down the door. He was restrained by paramedics as he wouldn\u2019t willingly leave the restroom.\n\nAs they pulled him out of the stall he began screaming bloody murder \u201ctake me back! I want to go back!\u201d but the moment he exited the restaurant he passed out. He had no memory of ever going to a McDonald\u2019s the day of the incident.\n\nThe restaurant was shut down by police temporarily and was cordoned off as a crime scene before anyone could inspect the stall he had shut himself in before re-opening for business. However, anyone who used the restroom that day and following mentioned hearing several voices whispering things like:\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to go back.\u201d\n\n\u201cSaw you smile.\u201d\n\nThen there was a mysterious fry cook of his late 20's-early 30's at a McDonald's in Lewiston, NY, housed inside the historic Frontier House back in 1996 who mysteriously appeared out of nowhere from and went down the stairs from the 3rd floor where they would get the supplies from and walked onto the front counter and dumped scalding oil on himself without flinching or saying a word. Several of the customers started to laugh and roll around in the burning oil alongside him and all were rushed to the hospital. All but one had not recovered and passed but that survivor refuses to make a statement. Not that she easily could. Her throat melted all the way through and had to be completely restructured.\n\nThe manager claimed he didn\u2019t remember ever hiring the fry cook and that he wasn\u2019t in any official paperwork or crewboards. \u201cHis name tag didn\u2019t even have a name, just #### written on it.\u201d he said, Eventually, in the later half of the early 2000's, the McDonald\u2019s was closed and vacated for good.\n\nMost of the stories sounded like urban legends to me but it never failed. Wherever I found a story, a McDonald\u2019s had been shut down in its wake.\n\nNear the end of the mid 2000's the number of cover ups had become so frequent that McDonald\u2019s decided to either renovate, rebuild their stores or close them outright and sold to new developers. Every. Single. One.\n\nBut of course they\u2019d miss a few.\n\nI needed to see one for myself. I remember going in the old McDonald\u2019s as a kid but that was before the frequency of the incidents. That was when it was still safe.\n\nThere was a small town on the way to my parents\u2019 house just off the highway. Zimbabwe (not to be confused with the country) was its name. Maybe a hundred residents. Completely untouched by the outside world, practically forgotten. It was pointless to stop there for any normal reason because there wasn\u2019t a rest stop. Not even a sign to let you know you were close.\n\nLet\u2019s just say I had to sneak my way around some very old building permits to discover that they had one of the few McDonald\u2019s (aside from some treasured landmarks) that has yet to go through a rebuild since the 1960\u2019s and a remodel since the 1970's\/1980's. How lucky is that? I was surprised they even had an international fast food place, yet they didn\u2019t have anything else familiar such as a small gas station, supermarket and a post office and a few local chains,.\n\nI had planned a trip to my parents\u2019 place for the weekend before, and now i had planned it with a stop at Zimbabwe on the way. It was already dark out since it was the dead of winter and I didn\u2019t get off work \u2018till 5. I was cold and grumpy about driving at night, but mostly determined.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nI don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve ever found the place before phone GPS, the turn off from the highway was just a dirt road with no landmarks or anything. As I pulled into town none of the houses had lights on. Most of the street lights were out as well, as though nobody had remembered to change the bulbs in years. This place really was untouched. I\u2019d be surprised if most of the residents hadn\u2019t moved out or simply died off. It definitely had the makings of a ghost town anyway.\n\nI was about to lose hope when I finally saw it. The nauseous yellow light of those golden arches illuminating a vacant parking lot in the distance. It buzzed and flickered like a fly zapper running out of batteries, However something was wrong, below the McDonald's text, it said \"OVER 80 BILLION SERVED\", instead of the standard \"OVER 99 BILLION SERVED\" or the standard \"BILLIONS AND BILLIONS SERVED\" The advertising sign below said \u201ceat new mc-riddle sam-iches. We like to saw you smile.\u201d Which I assumed was just the hand- work of a lazy or stupid teen who worked there. I pulled into the lot and carelessly parked my car in the center (there was nobody else there anyway).\n\nWhen I stepped out of my car, I felt a squish under my foot. There was a burger covered in mold with a rancid liquid oozing out. The smell was absolutely vomit worthy. I jumped out to scrape the contents of the burger from my shoe when I noticed the whole parking lot was covered in trash. There were half eaten boxes of fries and sun baked children\u2019s toys spilling out of old greased up McDonald\u2019s bags, likely from the late 90's-early 2000's. Everything was mixed in with the dirt and snow like it had been here for months, possibly years.\n\nI hurried across the lot to avoid retching all over the asphalt. As I approached the door I noticed the windows were caked in dust. Somebody had taped a piece of paper to the door with the word \u201cCLOSED\u201d scribbled across it in red marker, yet the sign hung from the inside clearly said open, Strangely enough, another one was there, but it said \"LEAVE NOW! IT'S NOT SAFE HERE AT ALL ANYMORE!, HE WILL TAKE YOU ALIIIIIIVE, SAVE YOURSELVES FROM HIM!\", Which felt bone-chilling, Who were they referring to by \"him\"? Cautiously I approached the door and pushed.\n\nAn artificial bell hummed an old McDonald\u2019s tune that fizzled out on the last few notes as the door creaked open. I looked around the fluorescent lit room and saw it was void of life. There was nobody sitting at any of the tables and nobody attending the registers. Somebody had left a tray and a few cups including a happy meal one on one of the tables in the back but there was no other sign someone had been here.\n\nThe inside was at least a little cleaner. The toys on display by the counter were of characters I\u2019d remembered from my childhood, such as Sonic, Kirby, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and many more, likely from the early 2000's. The whole place's walls was covered in faded coats of white and blue paint and all the tables and chair cushions had that classic McDonald\u2019s color scheme of pink, green and blue with geometric shapes from the 90's, finished with trimming of wood. The wood looked completely rotten, but slathered in coats of polish as a sad attempt to keep it looking new. All of it had a sort of green hue which I contributed to the old lights. The most noticeable element, though, was a terrible burning plastic smell that stung my nose.\n\nI went up to the register. I felt like I shouldn\u2019t order anything but I was hoping maybe I could ask someone a few questions, The counter menu was stripped completely of it's prices, and the drive-thru windows had been severely smashed out, and boarded-over to cover it up.\n\nI waited for a good 15 minutes in silence. I shouted hello with only a muted echo for a response. I had been to a few McDonald\u2019s with bad service in the past but this was insane. With how dirty the whole place was I should\u2019ve expected as much.\n\nJust as I was about to turn around and give up, the cash register popped open. It was practically begging me to take a tip for myself. Besides, didn\u2019t I deserve a slight reward for wasting my time here? I casually walked over to it and saw at least a dozen 20\u2019s stacked high.\n\nLooking around to make sure nobody was watching, I reached in to take a few bills when the thing suddenly snapped closed right on my fingers. The metal dug deep into my flesh leaving a dark trail of blood down the side of the counter. I yelped in pain.\n\nBehind the counter at the other end of the grill was a first aid kit hanging on the wall. The lights were burned out in the kitchen area but I needed a bandage, pronto. I hopped over the table and made my way to the back. The burning smell was getting stronger as I walked. I noticed the grill was covered in a thick layer of grease, completely unsuitable for cooking. I passed by the frying station and the oil was filled to the top with maggots that kept increasing number to the point many and many were spilling out and scattering onto the floor.\n\nI quickened my walk to the first aid hoping to get patched up and out of there as soon as possible. I was starting to realize that this restaurant definitely wasn\u2019t open for business anymore and I probably shouldn\u2019t have entered it in the first place. I opened up the first aid kit and had to swallow some vomit.\n\nA cloud of mold burst out from it in every direction followed by the same bubbling black ooze that was on the burger outside. I started coughing and waving my hands in the air to clear the mold dust floating around.\n\nThe same bell I heard playing that McDonald\u2019s tune started up again as I steadied myself. I assumed it was broken like the rest of this dump. I looked back toward the counter and noticed everything seemed farther away. I must have been disoriented from losing blood and that awful smell. I looked down at my hand to see how bad the wound was and my eyes widened. There was no wound on my hand at all.\n\nI rushed back towards the counter in a panic when something under the stove caught my foot and I fell. In the darkness my eyes started to adjust and I saw the outline of a body. Somebody was under there. Maybe they were unconscious and needed help! I yanked at the person\u2019s arm and a half decayed body slid out across the floor.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nThey were wearing a McDonalds\u2019 employee shirt with a name-tag that read ####. Their mouth was contorted into a sickening grin but their eyes were screaming. I tried to shout but no sound came out like when trying to wake up from a nightmare. As I scrambled to get back up to the counter, the lights had started to dim and the McDonald\u2019s tune was getting louder, the notes fizzling and distorting as they played.\n\nOnce I had gotten my grip above the counter, I froze.\n\nSince entering, I never looked at the side of the restaurant opposite the counter. There was a play place.\n\nThe glass separating the main restaurant from the play area had hundreds of bloody hand-prints smearing down toward the floor. The tube slide was caved in with chunks of red liquid spurting out from the tiny hole left at the bottom. There was a row of nooses tied to the monkey bars in the corner with deceased employees wearing the same #### name-tags hanging from them. The tables around the perimeter had skeletons with rotting food left on trays, some of the food hanging from the skulls\u2019 mouths, which the skulls had holes in evidencing a mass shooting must have took place here. I looked on in horror, too shocked to move.\n\nWhile the rest of the restaurant went dark, a bulb in the center of the play place continued to glow like a carnival spotlight. Below it was a massive ball pit, barely able to contain all of its colored plastic balls. It was smoking under the blaring white light, making that awful burning plastic smell.\n\nThe balls began to rattle and fall off the edge when something inside started shuffling around. I wanted to run so badly but my body refused. Then suddenly the music went dead and the movement stopped.\n\nA yellow glove slowly crept upward from the pit below, writhing its fingers as it went. A connected red and white sleeve came after it, slowly alternating colors as they appeared from underneath. The arm continued to reach toward the sky, growing more and more, while its joints popped and cracked like breaking branches. By the end that arm had to be at least six feet long.\n\nIt finally reached for the lit bulb on the ceiling with its gangly gloved fingers and began to twist it loose.\n\nI broke into a sprint, jumping over the counter and toppling chairs as I went. That last light went out just as I got to the exit. I bashed through the door, breaking the glass in the process. As I rolled into the parking lot I heard a distant scream, and then something whispered right next to my ear in dead silence. It had the same tinny distortion as the McDonald\u2019s tune\n\n\u201cCome back. I want to see you smile.\u201d\n\nI haven\u2019t told anyone about what happened there that night. There was an article online saying Oroska burned to the ground a few days later. I don\u2019t know if it was a cover up or something else, but I\u2019m never going back to find out.\n\nI didn\u2019t share this because I want you to get involved, by the way. I shared it to warn you what happens when you do.\n\nYou can go to a new McDonald\u2019s, keep getting your Big Macs, get your McCafe coffee, that\u2019s fine. They did something to the remodels to make them safe, at least for now.  \nBut don\u2019t ever go into an old McDonald\u2019s. Not even the drive thru.\n\nI\u2019ve got to stop typing now and get some pain meds.\n\nMy jaw hurts and the hand I snapped in that register has been getting itchy.\n\nThe End. Now leave. Leave this story.\n\n"},"36":{"title":"Why is the category of Lost Episodes so hated?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kaddbg\/why_is_the_category_of_lost_episodes_so_hated\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Mix_Loves_Typhlosion","selftext":"I am new to Creepypastas so I am curious, why are Lost Episode pastas so despised yet some of them also seem to be praised as literary masterpieces?

I know what I saw and unfortunately the memory of it will scar me forever. For you to understand the true horror I experienced you must first understand the sequence of events that took place. \n\nAll day today I unloaded 30 bags of premium black mulch from a RAM 1500 and brought them into my mother\u2019s back yard for a landscaping project she insisted I complete.\nI raked repeatedly until 20 bags of the mulch covered a small area of her backyard; the once plain area was transformed into the perfect area to keep a dog house for our 2 dogs: Faye & Daisy. \n\nThe sun was beaming down harder today than it had in recent weeks as the Alabama weather refused to settle on one season. Sweat soaked my pants and shirt while beading down my legs before dripping into my mulch covered socks. Mulch was in my shoes; the small and spiky invaders stabbing my feet relentlessly until removed. Dust from the absorbent substance coated my hands and suffocated my pores. \n\nAfter finishing the task my mother bestowed upon me, I quickly retired to the shower to scrub even the tiniest trace of residue from my body. I donned my night time attire and went about my normal routine.\n\nI climbed into bed exhausted from a long day of physical labor hoping to settle easily into a good night\u2019s rest. Sleep did come easily but it did not stay with me for long. My eyes fluttered open slowly as I sucked down a big glob of drool that had begun making its way down my cheek and onto my pillow case. \n\n\u201cWha- what time is it?\u201d I mumbled groggily. I rolled over to check my phone and the time read 2:37 AM. I stared confusedly as I wondered why I had awoken so soon as my alarm wasn\u2019t set until 7:00 AM. I placed my phone back on my night stand and closed my eyes; hoping to hastily return to my treasured slumber. \n\nI lay still in my bed for only a moment before I heard a stirring in the kitchen. I jumped out of bed, grabbed my baseball bat that lay beside my nightstand, and rushed into my living room. I hastily flicked the light on to discover my back door open. I could partially see into my kitchen so I knew the culprit must be lingering beyond my line of sight or may have already made its way into my garage. I crept around the corner of my refrigerator and the kitchen was empty. So, the thief, or whatever this stranger was, must be hiding in my garage. I flicked the light on and meticulously checked every area the intruder could\u2019ve been hiding in. No one was there. \n\nAfter looking around more carefully in the kitchen and living room I couldn\u2019t find evidence that anything had been disturbed. The only thing that was out of place were a few disarrayed pieces of the premium black mulch I\u2019d spent my day putting into perfect order for my mother and our dogs. I chuckled to myself at my previous reaction and shook my head as I realized I probably just forgot to push the door all the way shut earlier. The wind must\u2019ve blown the door open which in turn produced the sound I heard. \n\nI scooped the pieces of mulch into my hand and opened the back door to haphazardly dump them into my backyard. As I stepped out onto my porch, the night air chilled me a little as the heat of the day had already vanished. I shivered a little and thought that I had better make this quick. I dumped the mulch and spun around to head back in doors when I heard a sound I\u2019ll never forget for as long as I live\u2026\n\nI wheeled around to see something so out there that I haven\u2019t gotten a single person to believe me thus far. Standing about 4 feet away from me was what I can only describe to you as: The Mulch Man. My thoughts and feelings raced hurriedly, ranging from initial confusion to complete and utter panic. A bag of black premium mulch was set atop 2 thick branches that looked like they\u2019d been broken off a nearby tree. It also appeared like whoever constructed this monstrosity in my yard had taken the time to don their creation with 2 more branches for \u201carms.\u201d A jagged mouth had been cut into the middle of the mulch bag as if the person intending to terrify me wanted me to see its evil grin. \n\nI angrily shouted into the night \u201cYou\u2019d better leave me alone now before I call the police!\u201d I listened for about 5 minutes before I decided this was probably some stupid prank by one of the neighbor\u2019s kids that must\u2019ve seen me taking the mulch earlier in the day. I turned around again to head back inside and catch some more beauty rest while the night was still young. \n\nI heard it again. I turned around and the mulch sculpture had moved closer to me. I cocked my head, studying it for a moment before nervous laughter erupted from my throat. I was just tired from the day before and really needed to get some rest. \n\nI was on my stomach before I knew it being pinned down by an incredibly strong being. I thrashed and kicked at first but stopped when I realized my efforts were futile. I lay still and waited for my attacker to tell me they wanted money or some other sick and twisted thing from me before they\u2019d leave me alone but it didn\u2019t come. \n\nWhat happened next shook me to my core. A piece of mulch fell onto my head before toppling to the concrete below me. I tried to turn my head but as I did more and more mulch began to rain down on top of me. I began struggling again to shake the mulch from my face and so I could scream at my attacker to stop. I turned white as a ghost when I realized the thing crushing me to the floor was no human opponent but instead the very Mulch Man I had thought was moving earlier. \n\nI began to cry as I realized that I would meet my end by an unknown cryptid and no one would ever know what truly became of me. Just as I accepted my fate, my mother burst through the back door and fired off a round from her shot gun into the mouth of the beast. I couldn\u2019t believe my mother had returned home just in time from a work convention she had flown to in London.  \n\nThe Mulch Man fell to the ground shrieking in agony before returning to a normal heap of premium black mulch and shredded plastic. My mother hurriedly embraced me in her arms and apologized for ever putting me in harms way. I forgave my mother easily. I still had to attend therapy for a long time after what happened because no one would believe me about what happened to me on that night. \n\nI still don\u2019t know how The Mulch Man came about. I don\u2019t know if someone broke into my backyard and put some weird ritualistic curse on a leftover bag of mulch. I\u2019m hesitant to say that The Mulch Man has just always existed and comes to haunt people that hate the chore that is yard work. \n\nPlease, if any of you have heard of or seen The Mulch Man then I need your advice on where to go from here!"},"44":{"title":"Help Me Find A Certain Story Please","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kag567\/help_me_find_a_certain_story_please\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Kerfufulkertuful","selftext":"I hope others remember this.

The wind was calm, and the noise of the city seemed to disappear. I was home, alone, as usual on Saturday nights. The television was on, but I wasn't paying attention to anything in particular; I was just passing the time, like anyone else would.\n\n\n\nThere was something strange about that night, something I couldn't quite put my finger on. It wasn't a specific sound, but a feeling. A feeling that something wasn't right. Something was just... off. I tried to ignore it, but I couldn't.\n\n\n\nI got up from the couch and walked over to the window. The sky was clear, cloudless, and the street was deserted. Nothing major, but still, there was something nagging at my mind. Something I couldn't shake.\n\n\n\nI went back to the couch and turned on the radio, trying to relax. Soft music started playing, but as the sound spread throughout the room, I noticed something that made me freeze.\n\n\n\nThe music wasn't just coming from the radio... It seemed to be coming from somewhere behind me.\n\n\n\nI quickly looked back, but there was nothing. The room was empty, except for the soft light of the lamp above me. The feeling of discomfort intensified. Something was there, and I couldn't see what it was.\n\n\n\n\"It's just my mind playing tricks,\" I thought. \"It's okay.\"\n\n\n\nThat's when I heard the first whisper.\n\n\n\nIt was low, almost inaudible, but something was clearly saying my name. \"Elios...\" the voice called, softly, as if it were in a dark corner of the room, right behind me.\n\n\n\nMy heart started beating faster. I turned around slowly, trying to locate the source of the voice, but there was no one. The room was empty, except for me and the feeling that something was approaching.\n\n\n\nI grabbed my cell phone and started looking for distractions. Discord, social media, anything to take me away from those strange feelings. When I looked at the clock on the wall, I realized that time seemed to have stopped. It was already 11:30 p.m., but it felt like I had entered a strange state of suspension. My hands were cold.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, a light flickered in a corner of the room, near the window. I quickly went over to it, but when I looked outside, I saw something even stranger. In the reflection of the window, I saw a shadow, a dark figure that shouldn't have been there. It was standing still, staring straight at me.\n\n\n\nMy breathing became heavy, and on impulse, I ran to the door of the room to close it. But when I touched the handle, I felt something cold, like an invisible hand, grabbing my wrist.\n\n\n\n\"No... I can't leave.\"\n\n\n\nThe voice was clearer now. It was a low whisper, but now, it seemed to come from everywhere at once. \"You're never going to leave again.\"\n\n\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to stay calm. \"This can't be happening,\" I thought. But when I looked to the side, I saw eyes glowing in the darkness. They weren't human eyes. They were large, black, and they moved around the room, as if they were watching my every move.\n\n\n\nThe creature was getting closer, and I couldn\u2019t run anymore. There was nowhere to run. It was there, but I couldn\u2019t really see it. I could only feel its presence. The air was heavy, as if I were breathing water.\n\n\n\nThe room seemed to shrink around me, and the feeling of suffocation grew stronger. My mind was in a state of total panic, and the lights began to flicker violently. The sound of the radio, which had been soft before, now turned into loud static, as if it was about to explode in some kind of distortion.\n\n\n\nIt was then that I heard it again. The voice. But it was no longer a whisper. It was clear, strong, and the phrase it was saying was now burning into my mind.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou will never leave here. You are with me now.\u201d\n\n\n\nFear took hold of me in such an intense way that I could barely move anymore. I was trapped in the room, but not physically. I was trapped in the mind of what was watching me. The room began to spin and distort. The walls twisted, and shadows seemed to dance in the dim light of the lamp.\n\n\n\nI no longer knew what was real.\n\n\n\nAnd then, the door I thought had closed opened of its own accord. The room was cold, icy, and I knew something was waiting on the other side. Something that shouldn't be there.\n\n\n\nI could no longer see the light. Everything around me became pitch black. I didn't know what was happening, but I was no longer alone. Something had taken me, and now I was lost, with no chance of escape.\n\n\n\nThe radio went silent.\n\n\n\nAnd all that was left was silence."},"46":{"title":"The Rules for Surviving Our Harbor","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1kad342\/the_rules_for_surviving_our_harbor\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Any_Plenty6743","selftext":"If you\u2019re reading this, then either you\u2019re thinking about moving to Oar\u2019s Rest, or you\u2019ve already made the mistake and landed here.\n\nEither way: listen closely. I\u2019m not writing this for fun. I\u2019m not writing this to scare you off, either. I\u2019m writing it because if you don\u2019t know the rules, you\u2019re going to die.\n\nOar\u2019s Rest is a small harbor town wedged against the Pacific, on the kind of jagged coastline where the cliffs are always crumbling, the waves are always angry, and the mist never really goes away.\nThere\u2019s a reason we don\u2019t have many tourists. There\u2019s a reason none of the locals ever swim past the third buoy.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason we still survive at all.\n\nHer name is the Guardian.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s what most of us call her. Some of the older fishermen call her \u201cThe Black Siren.\u201d Some of the women from the Outer Cliffs call her \u201cMother Beneath.\u201d\nI even heard one drunk asshole call her \u201cGod\u2019s Last Dog\u201d once.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t matter what you call her. She\u2019s the same thing.\n\nAnd if you fuck with her, she will fuck with you back.\n\nNobody survives the Guardian\u2019s anger. Nobody.\n\nThat being said, she\u2019s not exactly evil.\nWithout her, we\u2019d all be dead a dozen times over. She guards this harbor from things that make her look tame.\n\nYou\u2019ll see. If you stay long enough, you\u2019ll see.\n\nThat being said, here are the rules you need to follow if you want to survive your stay here:\n\n\u2e3b\n\nRule 1: Never, ever call out across the water after dark.\n\nThe ocean is not empty at night. If you shout your friend\u2019s name, the thing that calls back might sound just like them\u2014but it won\u2019t be.\nIf you hear your name whispered from the water after midnight, ignore it. Don\u2019t answer. Don\u2019t even look.\n\nThe Guardian will usually keep those things away from the docks, but if you invite them closer, you\u2019re on your own.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nRule 2: Stay behind the third buoy.\n\nYou\u2019ll see them floating out there, big ugly orange things bobbing in a lazy line. They\u2019re the boundary.\nThey aren\u2019t there for your safety from boats or currents. They\u2019re there to mark the end of the Guardian\u2019s territory.\n\nPast that line, you\u2019re prey.\n\nNot even she can save you if you\u2019re dumb enough to go beyond.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nRule 3: Never harm a sea creature inside the harbor.\n\nFish, crabs, even the ugly barnacle things that cling to the pilings\u2014don\u2019t mess with them. If you catch something, treat it with respect. If you see a stranded jellyfish, put it back.\n\nOne time, a teenager speared an octopus for fun in the shallows. Everyone found his kayak floating upside down the next morning, gutted like a fish.\nNo body. No blood trail. Just the kayak\u2026 and the claw marks inside it.\n\nWe all knew who did it. No one blamed her.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nRule 4: If you see the Guardian, mind your business.\n\nShe\u2019s not pretty in the way you\u2019d think.\nTall, slender\u2014almost stretched too thin to be real. Smooth black and grey skin that doesn\u2019t catch the light.\nQuills down her spine like a hellish porcupine. No eyes. No nose. Just that mouth\u2014a wide, splitting thing with a double lower jaw that looks like it could shear your arm clean off.\n\nSometimes you\u2019ll see the glowing tips of her antennae hovering above the water, like two fireflies floating in the mist.\n\nIf you see her: look down. Mind your business. Pretend you never saw anything at all.\n\nThe Guardian doesn\u2019t like being stared at.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nRule 5: Pay attention to the mist.\n\nMost mornings, Oar\u2019s Rest wakes up blanketed in thick, cold fog. That\u2019s normal. But if the mist turns blue\u2014even a little\u2014get indoors and lock your doors.\n\nThat means she\u2019s fighting something out there. Something bad enough that even she can\u2019t keep it entirely hidden.\n\nIf you stay outside, you\u2019re fair game.\nShe\u2019ll kill whatever she\u2019s fighting\u2014and she\u2019ll kill you too, if you\u2019re in the way.\n\nCollateral damage.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nRule 6: If you hurt her, she will not forgive.\n\nI don\u2019t care if it was an accident. I don\u2019t care if you \u201cdidn\u2019t know.\u201d I don\u2019t even care if you survive the first night after.\n\nYou lay a hand on her, or even try to\u2014\nYou are a dead man walking.\n\nIt might take hours. It might take days.\nBut when you least expect it, you\u2019ll hear a scraping at your door\u2026\n\u2026and you won\u2019t see morning.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nI guess you might be wondering: why do we even stay?\n\nWhy not just leave?\n\nThe thing is\u2026 we have left, before. Once. Back in \u201978.\n\nThey called it \u201cThe Empty Summer.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian disappeared for three straight months. No sightings. No blue mist. Nothing.\nWe thought maybe we were free. Maybe we could open up the harbor, start bringing in tourists, build a real town.\n\nIn those three months, thirty-seven people disappeared.\n\nThey didn\u2019t just vanish, either.\nWe found bones. We found hands. We found things that looked like shark bites, but the teeth marks were too wide, too deep.\n\nWe found a boat washed up on the rocks with something still alive tangled in the nets\u2014a thing that screamed like a child and bit through solid iron.\n\nThe Guardian came back after the third full moon.\nAnd everything else\u2026 went quiet.\n\nWe don\u2019t take her for granted anymore."},"47":{"title":"I can hear what my reflection is thinking!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ka94km\/i_can_hear_what_my_reflection_is_thinking\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"shortstory1","selftext":"I know what my reflection are thinking and I have always been able to read my reflection minds.

I am the former contents of a cocoon. I am the worm on the dusk\u2018s wet sidewalk. I am the cotton ready to harvest. I am the harm in a child\u2019s cough. I am alive, in every way I have come to be and, in every way, I\u2018ll continue to be. Lightning struck the ground, and crawling back towards the sky, decided the way it will be experienced. In a bright flash and gone, so insanely complicated. Impossible to capture in life or mind. Where I am now is not my fault, my past is a symptom of it. Where I will be never was and never will be up to me. I am only now regardless.\r\n\r\nI now sustain myself on the miniscule meat of the crawdad. Crawdad is best eaten boiled. Rip it out of the water it finds comfort in and throw it into your own water, hot. I can\u2018t stand it, I sweat more than I drink. Flavor it in any way, it doesn\u2019t mind. After it\u2018s been stripped of life and its natural flavor, rip it in half by the tail. Discard the guts and remove the meat from the tail. Then remove its digestive tract regardless of whether it ate anything recently. If it got a lot of work, it\u2019ll have big claws. Its claws have little thumbs. If you pull on them just right, the best meat is inside there. Because they earned it. They deserve It and so do I.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of the crawdad\u2018s labor was for me. The fruits of my labor are for no one. I only had my first break yesterday. I spent my day screaming and running. I also spent it smiling. I spent it on myself and now my savings are gone. I am out of time. For 2 months I have been a slave to avoidance and a victim of fear. I have feared the call of man. And I am the representative of man in this valley. I have given nothing to the office. Every day I do nothing more than sustain and hide. I have pretended that what I have needed to do this entire time was what I had to fear, but I get it now. I am ready whether it be my choice or not.\r\n\r\nMy best day, yesterday, was completed only within a hundred feet of myself. I only saw that far. A haboob tore through the valley. I woke up to the wind scratching my home, rather than brushing it soft as usual. Dust was obscuring my town. This could have been my only opportunity to give it my all. That unhappy bastard couldn\u2018t see me or hear me. I couldn\u2019t see or hear him. We were separated for the first time. I turned on every light in my home. I knocked on every front door on my street. I screamed and I screamed, but never a word. I was sick of talking to myself, so I let my screams be indeterminate. \r\n\r\nI walked my former route to the gas station, still calling out to nothing. My routine was being reclaimed. I met every house and building on the way, they introduced themselves one by one. Visiting me through the dust and then fading away behind me. Everything was temporary and my world became so very small. I was only a block away from the station when I felt it. I did not hear it but I felt it. That crippling vibration. I stopped screaming. It happened again, more intensely. It wasn\u2018t me. I didn\u2019t cause this. I couldn\u2018t have. He couldn\u2019t hear me. I was free. I was dead in my tracks, alive in my breath.\r\n\r\nThe wind grew more exponentially more intense, growing in pressure until I witnessed the tower of callous skin cells crash down to my side and onto the next home. The sudden gust of wind blew me over the street into the neighbor\u2018s yard and rolled me across the dirt in a somersault that culminated in my right heel penetrating a plastic fence and my left arm under my back. I nearly tore my Achilles tendon on the fence and instantly broke my left humerus. I fought for my breath to return to my lungs for a moment before the foot of the giant lifted back up and my body was thrust back onto the road by the wind fighting to return to the sudden vacuum left behind. Rolling on the asphalt, it shredded my back with stripes after taking all the skin from my knees.\r\n\r\nI spent a while on my stomach. The only thing that hurt worse than the dust coating the wounds on my back was the weight of my torso forcing the sharp rocks of Thatcher asphalt into my back side. I eventually got up and limped home. If it was still there, I\u2018d like the privilege of dying in my own bed. Stumbling onto my lawn to see it still there. I collapsed onto what used to be fresh and comfortable grass and is now coarse desert dirt with a thin film of the dust of todays false freedom. I woke up the next day to a sunburn on the back of my neck. \r\n\r\nI lifted my head through pain\u2018s realization to a noonday sun. I couldn\u2019t crawl on my knees so I had no choice to stand. Inside of my home was every light still on. I prayed that the dust had just cleared within the day, and my home hadn\u2018t been a beacon through the night. It had to have been true. I was still alive, my home was still there. Surely he would have finally killed me if he saw. I winced through a climb of my straight ladder to my roof to peek over. H e was not there across the valley. The pain of my entire body traveled to my heart. My wounds bled harder as my heart beat faster. He wasn\u2019t to the east or west. \u201cHe left.\u201d I spoke. \u201cHe finally left!\u201d I cheered.\r\n\r\nI started to raise myself up to stand. In the process, I stopped for a sit and turned around to match the angle of the roof. I sat there admiring the wide base of Mount Graham through squinted eyes. I scanned up to the peak of Mount Graham where I made my first eye contact in 2 months. Creeping over the top of the mountain were a scalp of scabs miles long and 2 eyes open wide, locked onto my home.\r\n"},"50":{"title":"The last day of summer.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1k9unz2\/the_last_day_of_summer\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"NathanielPhoenix","selftext":"Me and my friends were exploring this abandoned building once and it was crazier than we thought. \n\nSo me and my three friends, let\u2019s call them Joe, Bud and Reagan. We were bored on the last day of summer and wanted something exciting to do. Bud said \u201c how about we go explore something?\u201d At first we didn\u2019t really want to do that. It felt too boring. All the abandoned buildings around our town were already explored or demolished but Bud told us about a new abandoned building. One that any of us had ever heard about. We hadn\u2019t even seen the building even though almost all of us had lived in that town for 18 years. Except for Reagan, he moved in a couple of years back.\n\n\nOnce Bud told us about a house that we had never heard of. All of us got very excited. All the other abandoned buildings were lame but this one sounded very thrilling. \u201cThe building is said to be an old psych ward,\u201d Bud said. That got us even more excited. \u201cHow old is it?\u201d I asked. \u201c I don\u2019t really know.\u201d Bud said. \u201cAll I know is that it\u2019s abandoned and supposed to be very scary and there may even be traps\u201d Bud added. \u201cWow\u201d we all said in unison. The traps made it more exciting for us because we were young and thought it\u2019s like a video game. We got outside, hopped on our bikes and took off.\n\nWe stopped by a store and got some snacks and energy drinks to enjoy, while we were inside the building. Then it was time to go. We went into a forest nearby. Bud was the only one who knew where this place was. That made me a little bit suspicious about this whole thing. That and the fact that this was supposed to be an abandoned psych ward that none of us knew about. We walked on this path through a dense forest. The path was old and no one had been there in ages. Or so we thought. It was dark even though it was during the day because the forest was that dense.\n\n\nThen I started to see light coming through the thick leaves and branches and a building. \u201cPretty small\u201d I thought. The building was quite small, about the size of a 2 story house. It looked small because I imagined a psych ward to be huge. It looked abandoned but not completely worn off by the weather. The windows had bars on them and the paint was in pretty good shape. Few cracks here and there but nothing big. Surprisingly it did not have any fence or gate surrounding it, just the building in the middle of the woods. \u201cHow the hell have we not heard about this?\u201d Joe said. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d I answered in disbelief. We walked up to the front door. It looked almost normal but it too had bars on its windows. We tried the handle. \u201cClick\u201d The door unlocked and we opened it.\n\nAs we got inside everything looked brand new. Walls were painted a light blue color and the floor was made from wood. All in darn good shape for an abandoned building. Everyone was pretty anxious about the whole thing, I could feel it. \u201cHow long has this even been abandoned?\u201d I asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know but it doesn\u2019t look abandoned\u201d Bud said with this horrified look on his face. He looked like he didn\u2019t have any clue about this place and from how he talked earlier it seemed like he had been inside this building before. \u201cSo you have never been here?\u201d I asked with a small bit of anger in my voice. \u201cNope,\u201d he told us. Now we all were scared as hell. I sensed that in each one of us.  We were all scared and wanted to get out but our egos didn\u2019t allow it and we continued exploring.\n\nWe went into a room. It had a sofa in it and a couple of chairs with restraints on it. \u201cWow this actually is abandoned and old,\u201d Reagan said. \u201cThese types of chairs are not used anymore,\u201d He added.  Apparently he was really into abandoned hospitals and psych wards and had been researching them alot.  Then we heard a ghostly voice whisper  \u201cget out\u201d. \u201cWhat the fuck\u201d Joe said loudly. Then we heard a door slam shut and footsteps followed by what seemed to be chains rattling or someone walking with chains on their body. We looked behind us and the door to the room was closed. \u201cdid that door just slam shut?\u201d I stuttered. I was terrified and almost had a panic attack. \u201c I think it did\u201d Reagan said also stuttering. \u201cWe need to get out!\u201d Bud yelled. \n\nSo we did. Joe went first and opened the door slowly. We heard nothing. We stepped back in to the lobby. We heard a whisper \u201csssss\u201d but I couldn\u2019t hear what it said. Then we heard the chain rattle again. It sounded like it was coming closer and it was. Every second that passed that sound came closer and closer.\n\nWe started walking towards the exit. We wanted to get out of there.  I tried to open the front door but it didn\u2019t open. \u201cWhat?\u201d I thought. We just came in from that door maybe 20 minutes ago. \u201cIt\u2019s locked,\u201d I said, visibly shaking. \u201cWe have to find another way out,\u201d said Joe. He didn\u2019t seem scared at all. That calmed me down too because what could happen to us, right?\n\nWe started to walk inside the building looking for a way out. The rattling was gone. Weird. Then all of a sudden we heard another slam sound. I looked behind us and I can still see that picture in my head. \n\nThere it was, Bud. Laying on the floor. Not moving nor breathing. I checked his pulse and he was dead. He had a plank attached to his head with lots of blood on the floor. \u201cWhat the fuck\u201d I yelled and we started running towards the exit. I was so scared that I almost couldn\u2019t run. We made it to the exit and opened the door. \u201cHow the fuck is it unlocked?\u201d Reagan yelled. And he started to cry as well. Then we started to run away from there so fast that we even forgot our bikes.\n\nI glanced back at the building and I saw lights on in one room and a weird figure just waving at us. We stopped to catch our breath and I called the police. We waited for what felt like at least two hours but in reality it was maybe 20 minutes. The cops arrived and we explained what happened. They went in and came out maybe 10 minutes later. They said that Bud was really dead but the house was also empty. We were all shocked and started to cry a little. Or at least me and Reagan did. Joe was calm, too calm. It was bizarre. Our friend just died and all because we entered that abandoned ward. I never thought that this would be the last time I\u2019m going to see Bud.\n\n"},"51":{"title":"Naruto's Lost Shadow Clone","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ka85sc\/narutos_lost_shadow_clone\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"ZenXvolt","selftext":"\"They say not every shadow clone disappears when it's supposed to..\"\n\nIt was during a brutal battle deep in the forests near the Hidden Mist Village, when Naruto, exhausted but desperate, unleashed a mass of shadow clones.

A wandering Mist-nin, lost and wounded. The clone, still bearing Naruto\u2019s innocent face and bright blue eyes, approached the man with a trembling smile, pretending to offer help. When the man leaned on him, the clone dragged him into a hollowed tree trunk and tore into him like a wild beast.\n\nThe taste was addicting. The feeling of chakra pouring into its false body, knitting the instability back together, was better than anything it could have imagined.\n\nFrom then on, it became a predator, wearing Naruto's face like a mask. It would approach unsuspecting victims \u2014 sometimes with laughter, sometimes with concern \u2014 and lead them away, whispering:\n\n\"This way... it's safe here, \u2014dattebayo...\"\n\nOnly for the screams to be swallowed by the trees.\n\n\nWeeks passed. The clone grew stronger. Its features started warping slightly \u2014 teeth sharper, hair a shade darker, eyes flickering a red-orange hue when it lost control. It learned to hide these imperfections behind a cheerful smile, an almost flawless imitation of the real Naruto.\n\nBut deep inside, it no longer felt like a shadow or an extension. It believed it was Naruto.\nA better Naruto \u2014 one unbound by morals, by weakness, by ties to others.\n\nThere was only one thing left to do: eliminate the original.\n\n\nOne misty evening, Naruto found himself alone while scouting for rogue shinobi. The air was cold, too cold for the season, and a strange stillness hung over the woods.\n\nThen he heard it: the familiar chuckle.\n\n\"Yo! How are you my brother! Long time no see..,\" said a voice identical to his own.\n\nNaruto spun around, kunai drawn \u2014 and there it was: himself, standing a few feet away, grinning wildly. But something was wrong. The grin was too wide. The eyes too hungry. The chakra... twisted.\n\n\"Who the hell are you?\" Naruto barked, sensing the malevolence oozing off the figure.\n\nThe clone only laughed, a hoarse, grating sound. \"C'mon, don't be like that. I'm you... your missing alter ego..\"\n\nBefore Naruto could react, the clone lunged. Their clash lit up the forest in flashes of violent energy. But the clone fought dirty \u2014 biting, clawing, using forbidden jutsu Naruto had never even learned.\n\nIn between strikes, the clone hissed:\n\n\"I'll take your place... Nobody will even know you're gone. I'll be the hero. I'll be loved. And I'll never... EVER... be weak again!\"\n\nThe fight raged on for what felt like hours. Blood stained the earth. Trees shattered. Birds fled screaming.\n\nFinally, Naruto managed to pierce the clone's chest with a Rasengan, its body shuddering, cracking like broken glass. But before it dissolved, it whispered one last time:\n\n\"There are others... you made so many of us... you think I'm the only one who woke up?\"\n\nWith that, it shattered into mist, leaving Naruto alone, heart hammering in the silence.\n\n\nSince that night, Naruto never used the Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu again without a sense of unease gnawing at him. Maybe that's why the First Hokage declared it a forbidden jutsu.\nSometimes, in the dead of night, he swore he saw his own face grinning at him from the treeline.\nOther times, villagers would vanish \u2014 last seen smiling and walking with someone they trusted deeply. Someone... who looked just like Naruto.\n\nThey say shadows can never be trusted.\nAnd some of them... never truly leave.\n"},"52":{"title":"trying to find a old story","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1k9w4dl\/trying_to_find_a_old_story\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Dull-Bonus5827","selftext":"there was this creepypasta someone narrated i cant remember who, but the story had this guy who went into his basement with his dog after a emergency alert\/tornado warning and while in the basement there were like mimics speaking to him trying to get him to let them in"},"53":{"title":"I only accept apologies at 10:45 pm and nothing earlier or later","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1k9uxhp\/i_only_accept_apologies_at_1045_pm_and_nothing\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"shortstory1","selftext":"I only accept apologies at 10:45pm and nothing to late or too early. It has to be at 10:45 pm and only then will people be able to apologise to me. It's the best to for apologies to happen and I don't like it when apologies either come to early or late. My country is at war and dead bodies are everywhere, everything is being rationed and destruction is rife. The will to survive is strong though and we all kept going. I am disciplined though and I mean it when I say that at 10:45 pm, is when I will accept apologies. \n\nSo when takar came to me and apologised to me at 10:46 pm I was furious. I had murderous thoughts and then I noticed that I am living in a war zone. Buildings have been bombed and collapsed, and so when I murdered takar for apologising to me at 10:46 pm instead of 10:45pm, I realised that a war zone is a perfect place for a murderer and serial killer. No one will even tell the difference whether someone had been killed through war, or from a murderer or serial killer. It's crazy how I am in the right environment. \n\nThen when eranica apologised to me at 10:44pm instead of 10:45 pm I was disgusted by her. There had been more bombs thrown down us before and that meant more fresh dead bodies. So when I murdered eranica for apologising to me at 10:44pm instead of 10:45 pm, I just put her body into the rubble and no one will be able to tell that she was murdered, they will simply think that she is a victim of war. \n\nThen I started to succumb to survivors guilt because I am so lucky to be born in a place, where there are so many people being killed and bodies all over the place. Imagine someone murdering someone in a place where it is peaceful and not a war zone, if i murdered someone in a non war zone place I would be struggling to not get caught. Luckily I live in a war zone place and dead bodies are a common sight. I have been so ungrateful to my situation where it makes it easier to murder. \n\nSo I decided to go to the mirror and say sorry to myself for being ungrateful. Then I realised that I said sorry to myself at 10:44 pm instead of 10:45pm. My reflection turned angry and came out of the mirror to try and kill me. I ran away and I am still running away.

He Came Back...Different.\nI've been debating whether to post this for days now. Part of me thinks writing it all down might help me process what's happening, but another part is terrified that acknowledging it makes it more real. I need to know if anyone else has experienced anything like this. Please. I'm not trying to scare anyone. I genuinely need help understanding what's happening to my dog and to me.\n\nFor context, I live in a modest three-bedroom house at the edge of Millfield, backing up to Blackwood Forest. I moved here eight months ago after my relationship with Marcus ended. Five years together, engagement ring picked out, then I found the texts from his coworker. I needed somewhere quiet to rebuild myself, somewhere far from shared memories and mutual friends. Real estate was cheap here because of the \"Millfield Reputation,\" as the locals call it. Three disappearances in the past decade, all ultimately attributed to people getting lost in Blackwood's dense wilderness. The old-timers at the local coffee shop sometimes mention how the Native tribes avoided these woods long before settlers arrived. \"Bad medicine,\" they'd say with knowing glances. I never paid much attention to the folklore. I should have.\n\nIt's mostly quiet here except for the occasional hiker passing through to the trails. I've lived alone since the breakup. Just me and Cooper, my four-year-old chocolate Lab mix. The one good thing I took from that relationship.\n\nCooper has always been the perfect dog. Goofy, affectionate, and smart enough to know when I need space or comfort. He sleeps at the foot of my bed most nights, only moving when the heating kicks on and the floor vents become more appealing. We have our routine: morning walks through the neighborhood, evening walks along the forest edge. He's never shown aggression, never even barked at strangers without good reason.\n\nAt least, that was Cooper before.\n\nI first noticed something strange about the forest about a month before Cooper disappeared. We were on our evening walk when I spotted unusual markings on some of the trees near the trail. Not typical trail blazes or graffiti, but intricate symbols carved deep into the bark. They resembled nothing I recognized, though something about them felt strangely familiar, like words on the tip of your tongue that you can't quite recall. Cooper refused to go near those trees, pulling hard on his leash to give them a wide berth. I didn't think much of it then. Animals have better instincts than we do.\n\nIt happened nineteen days ago. We were on our evening walk along the trail that borders the forest when a group of deer startled ahead of us. Cooper has always been curious about wildlife, but never one to chase. We'd worked on that extensively when he was a puppy. But this time was different. Something about their sudden movement triggered something in him, and before I could tighten my grip on the leash, he yanked it from my hand and bolted after them into the woods.\n\nI called his name until my voice gave out. I searched until it was too dark to see, using my phone's flashlight to navigate the increasingly dense trees. The forest felt wrong that night. The typical ambient sounds of insects and nocturnal creatures had fallen silent, replaced by what I can only describe as a pulsing silence. A silence that felt alive, watchful. I had to give up when my battery died, promising myself I'd return at first light.\n\nThe next two weeks were hell. I put up flyers everywhere, called every shelter within fifty miles, and posted in every local Facebook group. I walked those woods every morning and every evening, expanding my search area each day. I left his favorite blanket and some food at the edge of the forest where he'd disappeared. I took time off work to search. I barely slept.\n\nOn day fifteen, Mrs. Abernathy, the elderly woman who lives two blocks over, called. She'd seen my posts and wanted to tell me she thought she'd seen Cooper near the old Wilkins property at the far edge of the woods, about four miles from where he'd disappeared.\n\nMrs. Abernathy has lived in Millfield her entire life. She's one of those small-town fixtures who knows everything about everyone. Her family had been here since the town's founding, and she often shared stories about Millfield's history. Not the sanitized version in the town brochures, but the dark stories passed down through generations. She was the first person who told me about the Wilkins farm when I moved here.\n\n\"The Wilkins place has a history,\" she told me over welcome cookies. \"Old man Wilkins was involved in some strange practices back in the 1920s. They say he brought books back from Europe after the Great War. Started holding meetings in that cellar of his. Then one winter, the entire family vanished. Seven people, gone without a trace. The authorities found... unusual things in that cellar. Nobody's lived there since.\"\n\nI'd dismissed it as small-town superstition then. Now her voice on the phone carried a weight that made me uneasy.\n\n\"Are you sure it was him?\" I asked, trying not to sound too desperate.\n\nThere was an odd pause before she answered. \"Well, it looked like your Cooper... mostly. But something was... off about the way he moved. Like he was being... puppeteered. Thought it was just my eyes playing tricks.\" Another pause. \"You be careful if you go looking out there, Alex. Some parts of those woods, they change people. Change animals too.\"\n\nI thanked her and immediately drove to the Wilkins property. An abandoned farmhouse that local teens used for parties sometimes. The place always gave me the creeps, but I'd have walked through hell itself to find Cooper.\n\nThe property was silent when I arrived, just before sunset. The main house stood decrepit, with boarded windows and peeling paint, surrounded by overgrown fields. As I approached, calling Cooper's name, I noticed the cellar doors were ajar. Just a sliver of darkness between them.\n\nI heard a faint whimper.\n\nHesitantly, I pulled the doors open. The hinges groaned in protest, and the smell hit me immediately. Damp earth, mold, and something metallic I couldn't place. Underneath it all was a sweetness, sickly and cloying, like fruit beginning to rot. I used my phone light to illuminate stone stairs descending into darkness.\n\n\"Cooper?\" I called, my voice echoing. Another whimper, definitely a dog, somewhere below.\n\nI still can't fully explain why I went down those stairs. Anyone who's seen a horror movie would know better. But it was Cooper, I was certain of it, and he sounded hurt.\n\nThe cellar was larger than I'd expected, with several rooms branching off a main area. Water dripped somewhere, and my light caught strange markings on the walls. Symbols I didn't recognize, but which sent a chill of recognition through me. They were similar to what I'd seen carved into those trees near my house, but more elaborate, more... complete. They almost seemed to shift when viewed from the corner of my eye, as if rearranging themselves when not directly observed. There were dark stains on the concrete floor that I tried not to think about too much. The air felt thick, almost resistant, as if the darkness itself had substance.\n\nI followed the sound of breathing to the farthest room. The temperature dropped noticeably as I approached, my breath fogging in front of me despite it being early September.\n\nAnd there was Cooper, huddled in the corner, staring at me with eyes that reflected my light too brightly.\n\n\"Cooper! Oh my God!\" I rushed to him, relief overwhelming my caution.\n\nHe didn't run to me like I expected. He stayed perfectly still, watching me approach. It was only when I was a few feet away that he slowly stood up. His fur was matted with mud. No, not mud, it was too dark, too thick. And he smelled wrong, like copper and something rotten underneath the earthy scent.\n\nBut it was definitely Cooper. Same white chest patch, same notch in his ear from a fence incident last year. When I knelt and held out my hand, he finally came to me, pressing his cold nose against my palm.\n\nI was so overwhelmed with relief that I overlooked the strangeness of finding him in that cellar, of the odd markings on the walls, of the way he kept his head tilted slightly too far to the right. I just wanted to get him home.\n\nThe vet couldn't find anything physically wrong with him the next day. She noted he was slightly underweight but otherwise healthy. No injuries, no signs of trauma. She did remark that he was \"unusually calm\" during the examination, which was unlike him. Cooper normally hated the vet.\n\nDr. Levine had been Cooper's vet since he was a puppy. She knew his typical behavior, which made her concerned expression all the more troubling.\n\n\"His vitals are normal, but his pupils are unusually dilated,\" she said, shining a light into Cooper's eyes. He didn't flinch or look away, just stared ahead. \"And his body temperature is lower than I'd expect. Has he been lethargic?\"\n\n\"Sort of,\" I replied. \"He's been quiet. Not really himself.\"\n\n\"He might be a bit traumatized from whatever happened,\" she suggested. \"Just give him time to readjust. Keep an eye on him, note any concerning behaviors. Call me immediately if anything changes.\" She hesitated, then added, \"You found him in the Wilkins place, right? That old cellar?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"My grandmother used to tell stories about that place,\" she said, her voice lower. \"Just... watch him closely, okay?\"\n\nIf only she'd been more specific about what \"concerning behaviors\" might look like.\n\nThe first few days, I was just happy to have him back. I attributed his quietness to stress. He wasn't eating much, but the vet said that might take time. He followed me everywhere but kept a strange distance. Always watching, rarely approaching for affection like he used to.\n\nI tried calling my friend Jenna, who'd helped me search for Cooper initially. She'd always been our go-to dog sitter and loved Cooper almost as much as I did. I thought maybe seeing a familiar face might help him readjust.\n\n\"He's acting weird,\" I told her over the phone. \"Not like himself at all. Would you mind coming over?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" she said. \"I'll bring those treats he loves.\"\n\nWhen she arrived that afternoon, Cooper's reaction was disturbing. He backed away, growling low in his throat at the sight of her. Jenna, confused and hurt, tried to approach him slowly.\n\n\"Hey buddy, it's just me,\" she cooed, reaching out.\n\nCooper's growl deepened, taking on that strange layered quality I would become familiar with in the coming days. Jenna froze.\n\n\"What was that sound?\" she whispered.\n\n\"I don't know,\" I admitted. \"He's been... different since he came back.\"\n\nShe stayed for only half an hour, visibly unsettled by Cooper's behavior. At the door, she pulled me aside.\n\n\"Alex, I don't want to scare you, but that doesn't seem like Cooper,\" she said. \"The way he looked at me... it wasn't him looking out from those eyes.\"\n\n\"What are you saying?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Just... be careful, okay? Maybe get a second opinion from another vet.\"\n\nIt was on the fourth night after his return that I woke to find him standing at the foot of my bed, perfectly still, staring at me. Not lying down, but standing. His eyes caught the faint light from my alarm clock, gleaming too brightly.\n\n\"Cooper, buddy? You need to go out?\" I murmured, still half-asleep.\n\nHe didn't respond. No tail wag, no shift in posture. Just continued staring.\n\n\"Cooper?\" I sat up, fully awake now.\n\nHe turned and walked from the room, movements stiff and deliberate. I heard his nails clicking down the hallway, then silence. When I got up to check, he was sitting in the kitchen, facing the back door, motionless again.\n\nI told myself it was nothing. Dogs are weird sometimes. Right?\n\nThe next morning, I found him in the same spot, as if he hadn't moved all night. His food bowl remained untouched.\n\nThat day, I caught him scratching at the walls, not like a normal dog might when hearing something inside, but methodically, in patterns. When I approached, he stopped immediately and walked away, that same stiff gait.\n\nI tried to call Dr. Levine but was told she was out of town for a conference. The receptionist offered to schedule me with the other vet at the practice, but something stopped me. What would I say? My dog stands still and stares at walls? He walks funny? They'd think I was overreacting.\n\nI should have reached out to someone then. Should have insisted on seeing another vet immediately. But a part of me was afraid of what they might find. Afraid they might want to take Cooper away from me. After spending two weeks thinking I'd lost him forever, I couldn't bear the thought of losing him again, even if this Cooper was... wrong.\n\nA week after his return, the nighttime incidents escalated. I woke to find him not at the foot of my bed, but beside it, his face level with mine, inches away. His eyes were wide, unblinking. And his mouth... this is hard to describe without sounding crazy... his mouth was pulled back too far, exposing all his teeth in what looked like a grotesque approximation of a smile. It wasn't like a normal dog panting. The corners of his mouth were stretched backward in a way that shouldn't be anatomically possible.\n\nI gasped and jerked backward. Cooper didn't move, didn't react to my startled response. Just kept staring, kept \"smiling.\"\n\n\"Cooper, no,\" I said firmly, using my training voice. \"Go to your bed.\"\n\nAfter what seemed like minutes, he slowly backed away, never breaking eye contact, never closing his mouth. He retreated to the corner of the room where he stood watching me until morning.\n\nI couldn't sleep again that night.\n\nThe next day, I noticed other things. The way he would suddenly stand alert, head cocked, listening to something I couldn't hear. The way he avoided his reflection in the hallway mirror. The way he spent hours staring at the same spot on the wall in my office, occasionally emitting a low growl that didn't sound like his voice. Too deep, almost layered, as if multiple throats were producing it.\n\nI searched online for explanations. Could it be some rare form of rabies that the vet had missed? A neurological disorder? Poisoning from something he'd found in the forest? Nothing matched his symptoms exactly. I found a few forum posts from people whose pets had returned from being lost with behavioral changes, but nothing like what Cooper was exhibiting.\n\nI took him back to the vet, who again found nothing physically wrong but suggested a veterinary behaviorist. The earliest appointment was two weeks out. The receptionist must have noticed my distress, because she lowered her voice and said, \"You found him at the Wilkins place, right? My cousin's hunting dog went missing there three years ago. When it came back...\"\n\n\"What?\" I pressed when she trailed off.\n\nShe glanced around, then leaned closer. \"They had to put it down. It started... hurting itself. And then it tried to hurt them.\"\n\nThat weekend, nine days after Cooper's return, I opened the trash can to find it empty when I knew it had been nearly full. Later that afternoon, I found Cooper in the backyard, hunched over something. When I approached, he growled. A sound that made the hair on my arms stand up. Before reluctantly moving away.\n\nHe'd been eating a dead rabbit. But not like a dog normally might. It was... arranged. Splayed out, innards exposed in what looked like a deliberate pattern. The ground around it had what appeared to be symbols scratched into the dirt, similar to what I'd seen in that cellar and on those trees.\n\nI vomited in the bushes.\n\nThat night, I locked Cooper in the spare bedroom. I needed one night of uninterrupted sleep to think clearly. At exactly 3:17 AM (I remember checking my phone), I woke to scratching sounds. Not on the bedroom door, but on my bedroom wall. The wall shared with the spare room.\n\nScratch, scratch, scratch. Pause. Scratch, scratch, scratch. Rhythmic. Deliberate.\n\nI turned on the light. The scratching stopped immediately.\n\nThen I heard it. A sound no dog should be able to make. Words. Not barking that sounded like words, but actual formed words, in a whispered voice that was not Cooper's, not human, but something else entirely.\n\n\"Let. Me. In.\"\n\nI convinced myself I was dreaming, even as I heard the knob of the spare room door turning. I'd locked it, I was sure I'd locked it.\n\nMorning found Cooper back in his usual spot in the kitchen, facing the back door. The spare room door was still locked. I must have dreamed it all...\n\nExcept for the deep scratch marks on the inside of my bedroom wall, exposed where a chunk of drywall had been torn away.\n\nI should have left then. Should have gotten in my car and driven far away. But where would I go? What would happen to Cooper? And some irrational part of me still hoped this was temporary, that my real dog would return to me if I just waited it out.\n\nI called Mrs. Abernathy, the only person who seemed to know anything about the history of this town, of the Wilkins place.\n\n\"You found him there, didn't you?\" she asked before I could explain. \"In that cellar.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I admitted. \"And now he's... not right. Something's wrong with him.\"\n\nShe was silent for so long I thought we'd been disconnected.\n\n\"Mrs. Abernathy?\"\n\n\"There were stories,\" she finally said, \"about what old man Wilkins was trying to do down there. Something about opening doors that should stay closed. Calling things through. Things that need... vessels.\"\n\n\"Vessels?\"\n\n\"Bodies,\" she clarified. \"To walk around in. My grandmother used to say the Wilkins family didn't vanish. They were... replaced.\"\n\n\"That's just superstition,\" I said, but my voice lacked conviction.\n\n\"Maybe so. But you listen to me, Alex. If your dog isn't your dog anymore, you need to consider what might be wearing his skin now. And why it came home with you.\"\n\nYesterday, things escalated further. I came home from grocery shopping to find Cooper sitting in the center of the living room, surrounded by every photograph in the house. All taken down from walls, removed from frames, and arranged in a spiral around him. In every single one, his image had been scratched out.\n\nAnd last night... last night was the worst.\n\nI pretended to sleep, keeping my eyes just slightly open, watching. Sure enough, around 2 AM, Cooper entered my room. He didn't walk normally. He moved in a jerking, almost insect-like fashion, his joints bending in ways they shouldn't. He approached the bed slowly, then climbed up with unnatural grace.\n\nI forced myself to keep breathing evenly, fighting against every instinct to run.\n\nHe loomed over me, that terrible smile spreading across his face, wider than should be physically possible for a dog. Then he leaned down until his face was directly above mine, his breath smelling of rot and copper.\n\nI couldn't maintain the pretense any longer. My eyes flew open fully, meeting his gaze.\n\n\"I know you're not Cooper,\" I whispered. \"What are you?\"\n\nThe smile grew impossibly wider. Then, slowly, methodically, he began to peel back his lips even further, exposing not just teeth but gums, then what looked like a second set of teeth behind the first.\n\nI scrambled backward, hitting the headboard hard. Cooper, or whatever was wearing Cooper's skin, made that layered growling sound again. Then, in that same whispered voice I'd convinced myself I had imagined:\n\n\"We. Found. You.\"\n\nI slept in my locked car last night.\n\nThis morning, Cooper acted normal. Almost too normal, like the old Cooper, waggling his tail, bringing me his leash. But his eyes... his eyes weren't right. They had always been warm brown, but now they seemed darker, with flecks of something that caught the light wrong.\n\nI packed a bag and drove to my parents' house thirty miles away. I told them Cooper was acting strange and I needed a break. They don't allow pets in their building, so he's still at my house, with enough food and water for a couple of days. I set up a pet camera to watch him.\n\nFor the first few hours, he just sat in the kitchen, staring at the back door. Then, an hour ago, he turned and looked directly at the camera. That smile spread across his face again.\n\nHe walked to the camera, movements fluid now, nothing like a dog. His face filled the screen, eyes blinking sideways, that impossible smile widening.\n\n\"Coming. For.

There's something about it that's nostalgic, like a secret world buried beneath the city, with its rhythm. But I've learned to be careful about what you fall in love with, because sometimes, the deeper you go, the darker the things hiding there get.\n\nIt happened one cold evening. I'd been working late, the usual routine. The last train home. Empty stations, echoing footsteps. It was the kind of silence that made you feel like you were the only person left in the world.\n\nI was just about to board the last train when I noticed them. At first, it was a vague feeling\u2014like a slight itch on the back of my neck. Maybe a bug, perhaps a draft. But then that feeling became sharper, like a needle pricking my skin. I swatted at it, irritated, but it didn\u2019t go away. It felt like something was following me. Something that wasn\u2019t quite right.\n\nI tried to brush it off, but when I looked around, I saw them. Mosquitoes. They weren\u2019t the usual ones that buzz lazily around in the summer. These were different. Bigger. Darker. Their wings made a sound that felt heavier than anything that small should be able to make. They circled the station in a slow, deliberate pattern. Not random, like mosquitoes usually are, but calculated. Intentional. There were more than a few, and they seemed to be watching me.\n\nI tried to ignore it at first. Mosquitoes are pretty common, right? But these... they weren't acting like normal insects. They didn\u2019t scatter when I swatted at them. They didn\u2019t seem to be leaving me alone. I felt something crawl under my skin, an itchy, burning sensation that didn\u2019t make sense. I looked at my arm. There were already dozens of bites. Swollen, red, angry. But I didn\u2019t have time to dwell on that. I just needed to get out.\n\nI pushed through the turnstiles and headed for the platform. But then, I wasn\u2019t alone anymore. A few of the station workers were standing nearby. Their faces were pale and tired. One of them, an older man, noticed me looking and glanced around nervously.\n\n\u201cYou should be careful,\u201d he said quietly, almost like he was talking to himself. \u201cThey\u2019ve been multiplying in the tunnels. It\u2019s worse than before. They breed down there\u2014and it\u2019s not just the mosquitoes.\u201d\n\nI stared at him, confused. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\nHe looked away, his eyes darting to the shadows. \u201cThey\u2019ve been evolving. Growing. More aggressive. They\u2019re adapting to the heat, to the damp. They\u2019re becoming something else. Something meant to live down there now. And it\u2019s not just them. It\u2019s everything. The whole system\u2019s changing.\u201d\n\nI felt a chill run down my spine. \u201cEvolving? In the tunnels?\u201d\n\nThe old man nodded slowly, his gaze flicking nervously to the dark corners of the station. \u201cIt\u2019s the heat from the trains, the moisture. The deeper you go, the more you feel it. The rats, the cockroaches...they\u2019ve changed too. But the mosquitoes? They\u2019ve found something. They\u2019ve started feeding on more than blood. Their bites\u2014if they don\u2019t kill you\u2014they make you different.\u201d\n\nBefore I could ask more, the last train pulled into the station. He gave me a sharp look and turned away, disappearing into the shadows. I didn\u2019t get the chance to ask him anything else.\n\nI tried to shake off his words, but the feeling of dread only deepened. When I stepped onto the train, the atmosphere was different. The air felt thicker, the buzzing around me louder. I glanced out the window, my reflection warping as the train jerked forward. The lights flickered in the tunnels. And then, another bite.\n\nBut this time, it wasn\u2019t just a single prick. It felt deeper. Like something was crawling under my skin. The sting burned like it was digging in. And the worst part? I could feel them moving, burrowing deeper. I couldn't stop it. They were inside me.\n\nI started to panic. I pushed my way through the train, desperate to get to the door, but the tunnel stretched endlessly before me, a dark, twisting maze I couldn\u2019t escape. The train kept moving, but I wasn\u2019t sure it was even taking me anywhere anymore. Was I still in the Underground? Or had I crossed into something else? The station, the workers, the train, they all blurred together, a sickening fever dream.\n\nThe pain in my skin intensified as I reached the platform again, dizzy and shaking. The mosquitoes were still biting, still buzzing in my ears. I staggered to the surface, gasping for air. But they didn\u2019t stop. My skin was on fire, crawling with an itch I couldn\u2019t shake. Even outside, in the cold London air, they wouldn\u2019t leave me alone.\n\nI still hear them. Every night. The buzz of their wings, crawling under my skin. I don\u2019t know what happened down there, or what the workers knew, but I feel... different.\n\nSome say the mosquitoes aren\u2019t just biting anymore. They\u2019re changing us in tiny ways.  \nPassing things in their saliva.  \nNew infections, maybe.  \nMaybe something else.\n\nI\u2019ve heard stories. People who\u2019ve gone missing, found weeks later with bites all over them, twitching and mumbling in strange, half-forgotten languages. Their bodies look wrong, like they\u2019ve been remade, remolded for life underground.\n\nYou can still ride the Underground safely.  \nMostly.\n\nJust... don\u2019t take the last train.  \nAnd if you feel a sharp prick on your skin and you\u2019re alone in the carriage,  \n**don\u2019t scratch it.**\n\nThey can smell blood.  \nThey can feel heat.  \nThey can\u00a0*follow movement*.\n\nThe tunnels are their world now.  \nWe\u2019re just passing through."},"60":{"title":"Exploring creepy abandoned hospital (gone wrong!)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1k9sk19\/exploring_creepy_abandoned_hospital_gone_wrong\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Naldail","selftext":"\u201cIs it recording\u201d\nXavier asked as I fumbled with the bulky camera \n\n\u201cYea yeah, how close are we?\u201d\nI responded, raising the camera up to Xavier\u2019s face \n\nHe quickly glanced at the camera and back at the wooded old road ahead.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up guys!

I was five years old, too young to remember my real parents, and too desperate for love to question much about them.\nFor four years, life was\u2026 normal. Or so I thought.\nThey gave me a warm bed, hot meals, toys. everything a boy could want. Marilyn always kissed me on the forehead before bedtime. Simon taught me how to fix old clocks and catch frogs by the pond. I called them Mom and Dad, and I meant it.\nWhen I turned nine, they threw a birthday party for me. Balloons, chocolate cake, colorful hats. it was perfect. After the guests left, Simon leaned down to me with a strange look in his eye, one I hadn\u2019t seen before. \u201cCome with me, Artur,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a special surprise for you in the basement.\u201d I followed without hesitation. Wondering if they got me the electric car i wished for. The basement door groaned open, releasing a musty, metallic smell. We descended the creaking wooden stairs, the light growing dimmer with every step until Simon pulled a dangling chain, illuminating the room with a sickly yellow bulb, which was already on it\u2019s way of dying out. It flickered and sounded creepy to me. I looked arpund carefully and what I saw will never leave me. Tanks lined the walls, each one filled with grotesque creatures. A cat with the wings of a bat, a rabbit with the scales of a fish, a dog that blinked with human eyes. Some of them twitched, others floated lifelessly. In the corner, jars were stacked.. full of swirling, unnatural substances. Simon smiled proudly. \u201cThese,\u201d he said, waving an arm, \u201care my life\u2019s work. My experiments.\u201d\nI tried to step back, but his hand clamped down on my shoulder.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re special, Artur. Very special. And now\u2026 you\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\nBefore I could scream, he threw me onto a cold metal table. Straps snapped shut around my wrists and ankles. I begged him to stop, I cried for Marilyn, but she never came.\nSimon rummaged through the jars and selected one filled with a pulsing green liquid. I remember the label: UNKNOWN cMPs HUMAN #4\u00a3\u00a5*\u20ac\u00a3#*.\n\u201cThis one,\u201d he whispered, almost lovingly, \u201cthis one could change everything.\u201d\nThe needle gleamed under the basement light as he filled the syringe. I thrashed and struggled, but it was no use. The needle pierced my arm, and the burning started immediately. It felt like my veins were filled with fire and ice at the same time. I cried out, the stinging pain entering my system, my skin felt like it would melt away.\nSimon watched, fascinated, as my body convulsed.\nThen\u2026 he left.\nHe left me down there, strapped to that table, with only the humming tanks and the broken, twisted animals for company.\nThe first day, I screamed until my voice gave out.\nThe second day, I wept until my eyes were swollen shut.\nThe third day, something changed.\nMy skin began to tingle. I opened my eyes, waiting for them to adjust to the sickening darkness and saw a faint green glow pulsing beneath my skin, like the heartbeat of some alien creature. The pain in my muscles was replaced by an awful, coiling strength. I yanked at the straps. They tore like wet paper.\nI stood up, my body aching, my muscles tense. I barely recognized my own reflection in a cracked mirror on the wall. My eyes glowed faintly, and my hands trembled with barely contained power.\nI didn\u2019t think. I just ran.\nI smashed through the basement door and stumbled up the stairs. Simon was there, waiting at the top, holding another syringe. His eyes widened when he saw me.\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d he shouted. \u201cArtur, stop!\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t stop. I slammed into him, sending him crashing into the wall. His head hit the wood with a sickening crack, and he slumped to the floor. I didn\u2019t check if he was alive.\nI simply didn\u2019t care in that moment.\nI sprinted out of the house and into the night, the cold air burning my lungs.

You can call me Agent 73, though. I work for a secret government organization investigating strange disappearances and deaths, particularly those involving cryptids, demons, and ghosts. If you are familiar with the TV show Supernatural, then you know the kind of work I'm referring to. One thing I would like to address before I go into more detail. If a case can be classified as a 411 missing person, we have investigated it and determined that it is not of a supernatural nature. If it were supernatural, then you would never have known about it. If someone were to talk about one of these instances, I have already stated what would happen.\u00a0\n\nI have been a field agent for twenty-three years, so there is no cryptid I am unfamiliar with or case I haven\u2019t investigated. I now specialize primarily in Appalachian cases, but I started my career in the Pacific Northwest. I reached my 500th case last month. I am sharing this information now, not because of a current government dispute or global tensions, but because I had just reached 250 cases five years ago. The pace of these cases has increased exponentially over the past five years, and I believe the general public will soon be at risk. There is one outlier, though: we lost track of the Mothman eight years ago. There are certain beings that we keep a close eye on, either due to their danger level or because they exhibit more omniscient tendencies. The Mothman was tracked for the latter, but it hasn\u2019t been seen in Mason County for eight years. There are rumors that it was on the move at that time, with a few cult members from Eastern Iowa having wounds that matched those of the Mothman. However, not all the wounds were consistent with the Mothman, so we believe it might be a copycat or a demon they had summoned.\u00a0\n\nYou may wonder why the government would need a secret organization to investigate these beings. I wish I had a cool answer, like it was the founding fathers, because of the legend of the New Jersey Devil, the Mothman terrorizing Mason County, or even the Patterson-Gimlin Film. Unfortunately, though, it was formed because of two brothers who were killed in 1925 at the height of moonshining and prohibition. We were initially formed to protect cryptids and other wildlife from people going out and killing everything that might have killed or harmed a family member or friend. Shortly after, though, things shifted as we realized what we were truly dealing with. I am about to share the case report of the initial event, along with the numerous reports and notes that followed.\u00a0\n\n\n\n*This report outlines and details the incident that occurred on July 15th, 1925. Cletus and Clarence Marshall were illegally traveling on a level B road through the Applichola region. While they were traveling under the cover of night, they were attacked by a creature that could travel roughly at the same speed as their modified 1923 Ford Model T Pickup Truck. This was concluded by the footprints that were recovered from the scene, and the two spent 45-70 cartridges that were discovered about 150 yards from the accident scene. Cletus was found on the road about 30 yards from the accident scene. He had suffered minor scrapes and possible head trauma before he was killed due to a massive hole in his chest caused by blunt force trauma. We discovered his sternum and two vertebrae along the side of the road, roughly 3 yards from his body. The accident scene was situated at the bottom of a cliffside that sat at a curve in the road. Part of the roof had deep imprints, as if something strong had gripped it as the vehicle was moving. The common theory is that the beast distracted Clarence long enough to force him off the road. The scene at the bottom of the cliff was gruesome in nature. The Model T Pickup had overturned, and all the alleged illegal bottles had broken. We were able to recover one bottle that had remnants of what is believed to be an unlawful alcohol substance. The substance was jarred and sent to the lab for forensics to verify the contents. Clarence's body was recovered about 20 yards from the accident scene. It was wrapped around a tree in such a manner that his skin was torn around his midsection. His lower and upper intestines were observed to be leaking from the areas of torn skin. Upon moving his body for retrieval, it was also discovered that he had suffered a broken leg, and his lower spine was protruding from his back. It is believed that whatever creature threw Clarence had enough power to snap his spinal column. Clarence\u2019s official cause of death is dismemberment and blood loss.*\u00a0\n\n*Note: This case warrants special consideration due to its location and the public's outrage. Locals have already expressed desire to form hunting parties, which could lead to more lives lost, given the capabilities noted in this report. Locals should be kept out of the woods.*\n\n  \n\n\nI would now like to explain how I became involved in this line of work and why this first case is significant. As you might have guessed, this line of work is incredibly challenging to enter, making most of the agents descendants of the agents who worked the first few cases. My great-grandfather was one of these people. My grandfather, his brothers, my father, and my uncles were all agents in the Organization. I thankfully won\u2019t be passing down my role to anyone. As things have escalated, I find comfort in having never married and not having to drag someone through the emotions associated with not knowing if their partner is coming home or not.\u00a0\n\nMy great-grandfather was involved with this first case. He was an investigating detective for a town in the region and would often handle the more brutal cases within the county. He was ahead of his time, as he was meticulous about every scene he investigated. He would frequently expand the initial search radius by about fifty to one hundred yards. In one of his notebooks, he explained that he did this as he noticed a glint while taking a smoke break on a particularly gruesome crime scene. The glint was a small knife that matched the wounds found in the victim\u2019s chest. It was a ruthless murder. The victim had been stabbed thirty-three times in the chest and had both arms severed from their body. Based on the marks on the exposed socket joints, it was determined that the same small blade was used to sever both arms from the body. I am currently investigating this case, over a hundred years later, as there is a connection to a case I am working on at the moment. However, I will save that information for when the current investigation has been concluded. I will continue with the first case shortly, but I must return to my work. We just got another call about a situation in Atlanta. \n\n"},"65":{"title":"The Hope Diamond: Cursed Gem's Dark Legacy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1k9ufkc\/the_hope_diamond_cursed_gems_dark_legacy\/","flair":"Video","author":"MeanRound8382","selftext":"Is the Hope Diamond really cursed?

She was an amazing woman who I wouldn\u2019t have traded for the world but she was raised by horrible people, had an abusive high school sweetheart, and had a hard time saying \u201cNo.\u201d The cycle usually went that she would meet some jackass at her job, I never learned what she did for a living, and likely for good reason, and he would love bomb her until he found a nicer piece of tail or found out I existed. I ended up being the deal breaker more times than not from what I can remember. Darren was the first to break the cycle sticking around for 4 months before they got engaged and he moved in which was when the troubles started. I remember being 6 years old watching Power Rangers and Darren walked over to me to put a cigarette out on the webbing between my fingers which soon became his preferred way of saying hello. Through the walls of our shitty Section 8 apartment, I could hear him screaming at my mom every night before beating her. It would only end when he went out for a beer, in which case my mom would \u201csleepover\u201d in my room, or when he would get bored and demand she go to sleep. Darren made it very clear that if anyone came to check up on me or my mom that would be it for all of us and God knows I believed him. Even at my young age, I could tell from the look in his eyes that he was capable of and willing to do anything. I wore gloves year-round to hide the burns on my hands, came up with a hundred different stories for a hundred different bruises, and prayed every night the police would get lost when our neighbors called in a disturbance. When summer came around I would have the apartment to myself while Darren and Mom went to work. We didn\u2019t have the money for camps or water parks so I would fill out phonics and math workbooks during commercial breaks. Then, about a month into the Summer, I got a knock at the door.\n\n\u201cIssac? My name is Finn. Your mother hired me to be your summer sitter.\u201d I opened the door to a tall, skinny man holding a briefcase filled to bursting with toys and activities. \u201cHello, Issac, can I come in?\u201d\n\nFinn and I would do my daily homework together before making art projects or playing with the wrestling figures he brought over. We\u2019d end each day with a walk around the neighborhood and get back just before anyone got home. I\u2019d go back to my apartment and Finn would go to his at the very end of the hall. Every time we parted ways he\u2019d hand me a candy from his briefcase and say \u201cSame time tomorrow, little man\u201d snapping his fingers and pointing at me. That would make me laugh every time. The good times with Finn gave me something to look forward to even when Darren got especially cruel. That summer his job started layoffs and despite his constant swearing they could never dump him I suspect it was the stress that led to his new rule. Talking without being spoken to was liable to get you beat, our apartment was so cramped he could hear me whisper to my mom which would always send him into a fury. I maybe spoke two times to my mom in that entire period and I didn\u2019t dare to so much as look at Darren, not like that saved me from his wrath or anything.\u00a0\n\nAround this time, Finn started asking me about my bruises, and I went through my usual stories to explain them. Finn wasn\u2019t as easily deterred as a teacher or cop, however. Sometimes, he\u2019d catch me in conflicting stories or press me on details, and I\u2019d trip up. I stuck to my guns, however, and never told him anything. In hindsight, I wish I had, but it didn\u2019t end up mattering.\u00a0\n\n\u201cY\u2019know, you can tell me anything. You aren\u2019t going to be in any trouble.\u201d I knew Finn wouldn\u2019t hurt me but I still couldn\u2019t say anything to him, Darren\u2019s threats had my conscience hostage. I just said \u201cOk\u201d and he gave me a look like I really hurt him with that.\u00a0\n\nMaybe because of that, our art projects became therapy sessions. When I told Finn my dreams were scaring me we made dream catchers and talked about how to destress before bed. We made paper superhero masks when I said I wished I was braver. The one time I even implied Darren could be a bad guy, Finn had to draw a knight and a dragon then helped me prop them up on a page like a pop-up book. We had a long talk about how knights are heroes in a story, they don\u2019t cover for bad guys or make excuses when they mess up. They summon their courage and do what\u2019s right even if puts someone else at risk because heroes fight dragons they don\u2019t protect them. The meaning wasn\u2019t lost on me but at that age, you can dodge any type of guilt by just not thinking about it. No matter what my issue was, Finn had an art project for it. It was like he had everything we could ever need in that briefcase.\n\nOne day he came home stomping mad. Finn and I had made origami cranes and I planned to give mine to my mom but she didn\u2019t get home first. Darren picked up the crane from the coffee table, sparked his cigarette lighter, and burned it in front of my eyes. I wanted to beat the shit out of him to just take my tiny, scarred hands and smash them into his chest until his ribcage broke open. I screamed in a way you can\u2019t replicate or do justice to in writing, my breaking point was reached and I lost complete control of my body as I ran up and bit into Darren\u2019s leg so hard I swear I felt his tibia grind between my teeth. Darren pulled me back and shouted horrible things as he wrapped his hands around my neck and squeezed.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna kill you, fucking cum stain. I\u2019m gonna bury you in a scrap yard.\u201d He didn\u2019t make good on that promise, he just threw me against a wall right as my vision began to blur. I scurried to my room and blocked the door with a folding chair I kept in case things got really bad.\u00a0\n\nWhen my mom got home Darren wasted no time showing her his battle scar and saying I should be put up for adoption or kicked into the street. She tried to talk him down and got hit in return, I could hear her gasping for air between sobs and screaming \u201cHe\u2019s just a baby!\u201d as Darren desperately tried to break my makeshift barricade. He must\u2019ve been too drunk to counter the oldest trick in the book. I didn\u2019t sleep that night and neither did my mom, every time I braved a peek under the door I could see her slumped against the wall crying or passed out once cursing that she was ever born. When I let Finn in the next day his usual bright smile was absent. He asked about the bruise that wrapped around my neck like a scarf and I said I got it wrestling some neighborhood kids.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYour eyes look so tired, didn\u2019t you sleep?\u201d I just looked down and said I had a nightmare. Finn frowned and squatted to be eye level with me, \u201cIssac, lets take the day off from homework. You wanna go to the zoo?\u201d What kid doesn\u2019t? We spent hours exploring the place, Finn put me on his shoulders when my legs got tired but wouldn\u2019t move an inch until I was ready for the next animal. We were watching big fish in the aquarium when he sat down on a bench and I sat with him.\n\n\u201cWhat's your favorite color, Issac?\u201d Maybe it was because we were surrounded by it but I instantly said blue. \u201cNo argument here, that's a good one. Lots of versatility too, some people think it's very calming but it\u2019s been used to represent loyalty and trust too. Means you got a good heart, little man.\u201d We paused to watch a shark swim over our heads in the clear viewing room.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow about your mom, what\u2019s her favorite color?\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure about this one. Again, Darren\u2019s tight restrictions on when we could speak had caused me to rarely speak to my mom, and at 6 years old its not like you have a lot of information about your mom memorized. I knew what colors were girly though and picked purple. \u201cGood taste runs in the family. Purple used to be a really expensive color you know, they reserved it for royalty.\u201d Finn\u2019s face turned serious and he looked me in the eyes, \u201cI know things are hard for you guys right now but try to remember your mom does a lot for you. Most people don\u2019t appreciate it until they\u2019re really big kids, being a mom is a thankless job most of the time, try to remind her how much you love her as often as you can, ok?\u201d That\u2019s the type of emotional sentiment you don\u2019t understand until you\u2019re older but even then I felt my heart grow a bit. The sharks above us started to chase each other and I giggled cheering on the smaller one deftly ducking his pursuer.\u00a0\n\nOn the bus ride back, Finn offered me a piece of candy and asked \u201cWhat\u2019s your least favorite color?\u201d This one was easy, I hated yellow. \u201cSame here buddy, never seen a shade of yellow that wasn\u2019t tacky or garish. You ever hear someone get called \u2018yellow-bellied\u2019 on TV, Issac?\u201d I had once in a cowboy cartoon but told Finn I didn\u2019t know what it meant. \u201cIt means cowardly, a scaredy cat, and do you know what the mark of a real yellow-bellied man is? It's being a bully, no is more cowardly than someone who hurts others to make himself feel big.\u201d Finn\u2019s gaze turned inquisitive like his eyes were the interrogation lamp you see in police dramas. He asked me in the most serious tone, \u201cRemind you of anyone, Issac?\u201d\u00a0\n\nGod knows I wanted to say Darren. Just like when we learned about bullies in school. Just like when the preacher asked if any of us knew a bad person. Just like when the teacher asked where my bruises came from. Just like when the police asked if I had heard anything scary. I wanted to scream \u201cDarren! Darren! It's him! Fucking shoot the bastard!\u201d But if I did, Darren would\u2019ve hurt us terribly. So I said no, that I don\u2019t talk to bad guys and all my friends are nice. Finn sighed and checked his watch. \u201cWe\u2019ve got time for one more activity little man. I think you\u2019re gonna like this one.\u201d\n\nWhen we got home, Finn opened his briefcase and pulled out a box of cupcake mix. After a few minutes of searching for the right pans and trays we got to work and produced one beautiful tray of little domed treats. We ate them until only four were left at which point Finn set them on top of the fridge and got another box from his briefcase, frosting mix, then a set of food color droppers. We made three small bowls of frosting: Blue, purple, then yellow. Finn put blue on two cupcakes, these we shared, then purple on one, and finally, he took his time applying the yellow frosting on the last.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWho should we give these to?\u201d Finn asked with a smirk. I said my mom and Finn said grown-ups can only eat one cupcake a day or they get sick, their stomachs don\u2019t handle sugar as well as kids do. I didn\u2019t want to but I said Darren could have one too. \u201cGood, maybe it\u2019ll make him happy.\u201d Finn washed the dishes and put the cupcakes on separate plates before heading back down the hall to his apartment after giving me another piece of candy. This many sweets paired with the zoo trip had Finn in a close race with my mom and the red ranger for the greatest person alive.\u00a0\n\nMom got home first that day and I proudly gave her the purple cupcake. She smiled brightly for the first time I can remember seeing and asked how I made them.\n\n\u201cFinn helped me!\u201d I said, beaming. She cocked her head but smiled and finished her treat.\u00a0\n\nWhen Darren got home he cursed the traffic and screamed out for dinner to be ready. With lead feet and trying not to scowl, I offered him the yellow cupcake. To my surprise, he thanked me before inhaling it, even said my name. I still remember the wonderful dreams I had that night, would\u2019ve been one for the record books if I didn\u2019t wake with a jolt as my mom screamed bloody murder. I ran to her room because this wasn\u2019t the screaming I had learned meant I should hide, this was a brand new kind of scream that told my instincts to check out what was happening. Lying next to my mom in bed was Darren. He had clearly been thrashing violently in his sleep with one arm under him at an unnatural angle and his knees pointing up with legs spread like he was giving birth. But his face is what I really remember, it's been a recurring topic with every therapist I\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0\n\nHis eyes were piss yellow and wide open. Try as I have, and believe you me I have tried, I can\u2019t open mine that wide without using my fingers and enduring some great discomfort. His jaw was open and popped to the side like a freeze frame from a Mike Tyson hook, detectives on the scene said it was dislocated. His skin was drawn tight over his skull, and this really stood out on a big guy like Darren. Imagine if you could vacuum seal one of those Mission Impossible masks and then left it out in the sun so its color fades and that's about what I was looking at. From his forehead down to the left corner of his lips was one long scratch, not the type you give yourself when you forget to trim your nails before bed but more like what a pissed-off cat leaves. All of this froze me in place. When I did get the courage to step forward, my knees buckled. Mom scooped me up and took me to the kitchen where she dialed 911. I don\u2019t remember much of the following but after a week of questioning and investigation, they finally left us alone to piece together our lives again.\u00a0\n\nMom stayed home with me for a few days after that. We did my homework together and went on walks through the park. I thought about asking where Finn was, but honestly, I was still so shocked from seeing my first corpse that I didn\u2019t say much at all during that time. When my mom went back to work, Finn came over for the last time.\n\n\u201cListen, Issac, school is gonna start soon for you and that means you won\u2019t need me for a while. I want you to be good for your mom, ok? She loves you dearly and this is going to be a hard time for her.\u201d\t\u201cWill you be my babysitter next summer?\u201d Finn had become like a big brother to me, I didn\u2019t want to face the world without him or go a day without our fun arts and crafts projects.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry little man. I\u2019m going to college soon and by the time summer starts for you I\u2019m gonna be a long ways away. But we\u2019ll always have our memories, ok? Anytime you start to miss me just do some origami like we like to do.\u201d He smiled and put a hand on my shoulder. \u201cIf I start to miss you, I\u2019ll watch do our Power Ranger poses.\u201d That day he taught me how to handle the strong feelings I had in the fallout of Darren kicking the bucket and we made stress toy cootie catchers.\n\nMom and I moved out as soon as we were able. It took about a month of searching for an affordable spot and two months of saving money to finally leave and for all of it Mom slept with me in my bed. Not that I minded, I was honestly happy Darren was dead and I finally had time to be a kid with my mom again. When we did move out I helped move boxes down to our van. It was when I ran up to get the last box that I saw the door at the end of the hallway was open a jar.\u00a0\n\n\u201cFinn? Finn, you left your door open!\u201d I shouted across the hall to no reply. I bounced over and repeated myself to the same effect. Childlike curiosity and disregard for social boundaries led me to push open the door and peek at Finn\u2019s apartment. In hindsight, it makes sense. Just looking at the outside of the building raises questions about where you\u2019d even have space for something there. Behind that door was just a utility closet.\n\n"},"68":{"title":"Ordinary Creepypasta Game","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1k9piig\/ordinary_creepypasta_game\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"_Midnight_Angel_","selftext":"Has anyone played IJustWannaHaveFunn's creepypasta game?

They fascinated me, especially those with a macabre plot twist. I enjoyed reading them while sipping my coffee, but ever since that damned incident last month, I haven't been able to open a single story again.\n\n\n\nThat morning, as usual, I was browsing creepypasta subreddits while drinking my coffee. I'd practically read them all. But that day, something strange happened. Amid thousands of posts flooded with upvotes and comments, there was one story... with no likes, no comments. Completely forgotten. I clicked. I started reading.\n\n\n\n***WARNING.***\n\n\n\nThe story was clich\u00e9. Nothing special. It seemed inspired by those old slasher films where teenagers get massacred. THE IRONY. Just another recycled story among so many. I finished reading and went to work. Another shitty day, with my boss yelling at me as usual.\n\n\n\nWhen I got home, I noticed something strange. The front door was slightly open. At first, I thought I'd forgotten to lock it.\n\n\n\n***STOP.***\n\n\n\nI entered cautiously. My town wasn't known for high crime rates. I searched the entire house. Nothing out of the ordinary. I tried to forget about it and carry on with my night.\n\n\n\nAt 1 a.m., I woke up. The hallway light was flickering nonstop.\n\n\n\n\"Damn faulty wiring again...\" I muttered, going back to sleep.\n\n\n\nFive minutes later, I woke up startled by the sound of plates shattering in the kitchen. Horror clich\u00e9s are pure fiction, RIGHT?\n\n\n\nI got up and went to the kitchen. Everything was a mess. I was organized. This wasn't normal.\n\n\n\nAs I picked up the broken plates, I saw marks... of blood. Messages written:\n\n\n\n***YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE READ THAT STORY.***\n\n\n\nMy stomach turned to ice. How did someone know? This was always my secret hobby. I screamed. I called the police.\n\n\n\nThey arrived quickly. They collected blood samples. No signs of a break-in. The kitchen didn't even have a window.\n\n\n\nDays later, the results: the blood was mine. But how? I wasn't injured. I had no history of sleepwalking. I didn't do drugs.\n\n\n\n***OR DID I?***\n\n\n\nThe police dismissed it as a prank. They warned me. But the messages kept coming. Every night, in different places: on the bathroom mirror, on the bedroom window.\n\n\n\n***I WARNED YOU.***\n\n\n\nAnd it wasn't just messages. \"Accidents\" that could have been fatal started happening\u2014coincidentally.\n\n\n\nA brick fell out of nowhere, almost hitting me. A pitbull attacked me for no reason. I was nearly run over by a speeding car\u2014I was the only pedestrian on the street. I slipped three times in the shower, with no explanation.\n\n\n\nAnd then my house... caught fire. No cause. I lost everything.\n\n\n\nHomeless, I got fired from my job. I had no peace. I moved back in with my parents, but I quickly realized I was putting them in danger.\n\n\n\nNow I'm writing this on my phone. If you're reading this, understand: sooner or later, I won't be able to escape. This thing will get me. There's no use fighting.\n\n\n\nThe story I read... condemned me. And if you've read this far...\n\n\n\n***YOU'RE NEXT.***"},"70":{"title":"A Howl in the Mountains","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1k9ie8l\/a_howl_in_the_mountains\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"dorimarcosta","selftext":"\n\n\nThe old diesel truck coughed loudly before falling completely silent, parked next to the tool shed. The engine had a life of its own, just like the house\u2019s power generator, which had already failed three times that week. \"It's a gas guzzler,\" Dad used to say. We always kept a can of gasoline next to the outdoor cabinet \u2014 an emergency measure we knew we\u2019d eventually need. Life out there was like that: patched together, fragile, but functional \u2014 at least most of the time.\n\nThe night before, the usual calm of the farm was broken by the frantic barking of the dogs. Dad, used to small intrusions by wild animals, grabbed his shotgun and walked out with heavy steps. I followed, carrying a flashlight. \"Stay behind me,\" he ordered, his eyes fixed on the darkness.\n\nThe dogs were circling the pigpen, their bodies tense as if facing something invisible. There was a metallic smell in the air \u2014 a mix of blood and damp earth. As we got closer, we saw the scene: one of the pigs was dead, thrown against the broken fence. Its skin had been torn off in patches, exposing its ribs. The eyes seemed to have been gouged out.\n\n\"Cougar,\" Dad said, but the word came out hesitant. I looked at him, noticing the doubt in his voice. \"Was it a cougar, Dad?\" I asked, my eyes wide. He didn\u2019t answer right away. He inspected the surroundings, but there were no tracks, no clear signs of a struggle.\n\nBack inside, he reinforced the door locks and muttered to himself, \"Just an animal. I'll take care of it tomorrow.\" But deep down, something was bothering him. That strange smell, the silence that took over the forest after the barking stopped \u2014 it was as if the woods themselves were too scared to breathe.\n\nThat night, I had trouble sleeping. I woke up twice, swearing I heard something scratching at the wood outside. The second time, I tried to ignore it, but an inexplicable chill ran down my spine.\n\nDad didn\u2019t sleep either. He stayed in the living room, shotgun within reach, listening to the generator\u2019s intermittent hum outside. When the machine failed for the third time, he almost went to check it, but changed his mind. \"In the morning,\" he thought, as if making an empty promise.\n\nHe had no idea that dawn would bring more than just a simple generator repair. Something was lurking out there \u2014 something that wasn\u2019t a cougar, or anything he could face alone.\n\nAnd it was just getting started.\n\nThe sun had barely risen when Dad went out. I followed, dragging my feet, still heavy from lack of sleep. The smell of the dead pig already filled the air \u2014 sour and nauseating. The fence was still broken, and the chickens wouldn\u2019t stop clucking, restless, as if something was still prowling nearby.\n\n\"Go get the tarp from the shed,\" Dad told me, holding the flashlight. I hesitated, glancing at the forest around us, but obeyed. When I came back with the tarp, he had already dragged the pig out of the pen, trying to ignore the animal\u2019s gruesome state.\n\nThe body was almost unrecognizable. The claw marks were deep and distorted, as if the creature that attacked it had inhuman strength. Dad tried to rationalize it. \"It was a cougar. It had to be a cougar.\" But the absence of tracks and the mysterious silence from the day before still unsettled him.\n\nWe wrapped the pig in the tarp and dragged it to a hole near the back fence where Dad usually buried dead animals. The work was slow and unpleasant, and even the crows that usually hovered around stayed away, as if sensing danger.\n\n\"Done. It's over,\" Dad said, wiping sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand. But he knew he was lying.\n\nThe rest of the day was filled with an uncomfortable silence. I tried to keep up with daily chores, but the tension in the air was palpable. \"Dad, are you going to leave the fence like that?\" I asked late in the afternoon, but he just shook his head.\n\n\"I'll take care of it tomorrow. I'll check the generator before dark,\" he replied, grabbing his tools from the shed. He spent the whole afternoon trying to get the damn motor running properly, but the problem seemed bigger than he thought. The gas can next to the cabinet remained untouched, but every time he passed by it, a strange unease climbed up his spine.\n\nThe sun began to set, painting the sky blood-red, and the tension on the farm only grew. I brought the dogs closer to the house and locked up the pigpen. \"Dad, can we go to bed early tonight?\" I asked as the lights started to flicker.\n\n\"Yeah, we are,\" he replied. But Dad had no intention of sleeping. Something inside him screamed that the night would bring worse problems than a broken generator.\n\nWhile we were having dinner, the dogs started barking again. This time, it wasn\u2019t just a warning \u2014 it was pure terror. Dad stood up, grabbed his shotgun, and looked at me. \"Stay inside.\"\n\"But what about you, Dad?\" I asked, clutching his arm tightly.\n\"I'll be right back. I just need to see what it is.\"\n\nBut deep down, he knew he wasn\u2019t ready for what awaited him outside. The night was alive, breathing through the house like a beast stalking its prey. And it hadn\u2019t shown its teeth yet.\n\nWhen he went out, the sight was horrifying: two of the dogs were dead, their bodies twisted at impossible angles, as if crushed by something monstrous. The third was barking at the darkness but suddenly fell silent, letting out a final agonized yelp before being dragged into the woods.\n\nDad smelled it. It wasn\u2019t just blood \u2014 it was something deeper, like rotten flesh mixed with sulfur. He pointed his flashlight at the trees, and what he saw made his blood run cold: glowing yellow eyes, burning like embers.\n\n\"Who's there?!\" he shouted, his voice betraying his fear. The answer came as a guttural growl, a sound that seemed to vibrate through the very ground. Then, a figure emerged. It wasn\u2019t a man, nor an animal. It was something in between, with deformed muscles and black fur that seemed to pulse. Its long, filthy claws gleamed under the weak beam of the flashlight.\n\nThe creature lunged with impossible speed. Dad fired. The shot echoed through the night, but the monster didn\u2019t stop. The impact only seemed to enrage it. It knocked him to the ground with a brutal blow, his shotgun flying out of reach. As he tried to get up, he saw the creature tearing into one of the dogs like it was just a snack.\n\nInside the house, I heard my father's screams and started praying, but I knew prayers wouldn\u2019t be enough. I grabbed the machete Dad kept behind the door, my heart pounding as heavy footsteps approached.\n\nThe door burst inward, and the creature entered, its eyes locked onto me. I screamed, terrified, but didn\u2019t back down. As the monster lunged, I swung with all my strength, striking its face. A horrible howl filled the air, but the machete got stuck in its thick flesh.\n\nDad, wounded, crawled to the door and saw the scene: I was struggling while the monster gripped my arm, lifting me like a rag doll. \"Let go of my daughter, you bastard!\" Dad grabbed the gasoline can with trembling hands and doused the creature before striking a match.\n\nThe fire engulfed the monster, which thrashed in agony, dropping me. The smell of burning flesh was nauseating, but even in flames, the creature didn\u2019t die. With a final roar, it ran into the woods, disappearing into the darkness.\n\nWe survived, but we didn\u2019t come out unscathed. My father lost his right arm that night, and I was left with scars that will never fade. Despite everything, we decided to stay on the farm. We reinforced the fences, took turns keeping watch, and always kept our weapons close.\n\nBut the howl of that creature still echoes in my nightmares. I know it\u2019s not dead.\nI know one day it will come back to finish what it started.\nAnd all we can do is be ready to face it.\n\n\n\n\n"},"71":{"title":"The Heart of Wrath","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1k9hd88\/the_heart_of_wrath\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Asedrez13","selftext":"In the forgotten wilderness of the forest of Caelmoor, where the light hesitated to penetrate and the air was thick as rotting flesh, She was betrayed\u2014torn, mutilated, and left nameless, unburied.

Upon touching him, the rotting flesh of his corpse smoked, regenerating into a grotesque amalgam of viscera, exposed nerves, and blackened bones. She was reborn \u2014 but not as a woman. He was reborn as a walking altar of pain.\n\nHis fury was so thick that it made the air sharp. The first traitors barely had time to scream.

The place was cheap a rundown little house that used to belong to a retired Vietnam veteran. They said he passed away in the nearby forest back in the '70s.\n\nThe house was nearly empty except for some old furniture and dust. But on my first night, I found something strange.\n\nAn old, folded letter tucked between the sofa cushions.\nI\u2019m not sure why, but I felt like I had to read it.\n\nHere\u2019s what it said:\nI lost my best friend in Vietnam... He said he found paradise.\n\nIt was a strange day the last day I ever saw him. It happened during the Battle of Yawoting in Vietnam. A brutal, unforgiving war. The terror still clings to me. Guerrillas set up traps and killed my comrades silently. Day or night, it didn\u2019t matter. They were like ghosts stalking us, studying us learning how we moved, how we lived, so they could kill us better.\n\nEvery night we tried to rest, but the sun would rise again just to blind us with fresh fear. One by one, the ghosts took us. They were patient. Our lead officer got cocky. The next day, we found him ripped in half, painting the green ground crimson.\n\nThey chewed through us slowly, savoring every moment, knowing if they made even a single sound, we would fill them with lead. Blood filled the lakes. Blood filled our minds. We barely slept. Our bodies twitched and trembled, our minds stretched thin, knowing death could come at any second.\n\nBut at least... I had him. The one person who kept me sane.\n\nAngelo. My best friend.\n\nI met him during training free-spirited, fearless, a little rebellious. Everyone loved him. He once showed me a picture of his family: four smiling kids and a beautiful wife. \"I can\u2019t wait to go home and wrap my arms around them,\" he said, smiling through tears. He never slacked. He trained hard, harder than any of us, but because of that he was always hungry  constantly raiding the canteen. He had dreams. He had purpose.\n\nOne night, deep in the jungle, the darkness thickened like fog. I stayed up on watch, exhausted but too scared to sleep. I asked Angelo to take the next shift.\n\n\"Angelo?\" He nodded too fast, unnaturally, like a puppet. Something felt wrong. But I was too tired to think about it.\n\nA few hours later, I heard him whispering. Over and over. Soft. Repeating. Like he was praying.\n\nAt midnight, I heard him clearly:\n\"I found paradise. Come with me.\"\n\nI opened my eyes. I saw him sprinting into the jungle barefoot, fast, desperate. I followed, called his name, but he disappeared into the darkness. Gone.\n\nI stumbled back to our tent, shaking. His hammock was empty. All that remained was his hanging, chipped dog tag. We couldn't search in the dark. Too dangerous.\n\nWhen daylight came, we searched. No sign. No blood. No tracks. No Angelo.\n\nThe war ended years later.\n\nI demanded an investigation. The CIA called it: \"MIA.\" Missing In Action. Some soldiers said he went mad. Others said he tried to escape hell. But his body was never found.\n\nWhen I came home, everything was gone. My family was distant. No girlfriend. No friends. Nothing.\n\nI tried drinking. I tried drugs. Nothing numbed it.\n\nEvery night, I walked to a hilltop and smoked cigars under the moonlight. And that's when I started hearing them. Voices, soft and promising, whispering through the stars\n\"Follow us.\"\n\nThey opened my eyes. They showed me. Angelo was right. He found paradise.\n\nI followed him there.\n\nYou should too.\n\n\nWhen I finished reading the letter I took a picture of it to show to my friends, and I laughed it off. Crazy old soldier stuff, I thought.\n\nBut last night...\nwhile I was sitting outside, smoking a cheap cigar or at least I thought it was a cigar and staring up at the moon, I swear I heard whispering.\n\n\"Follow us.\"\n\nI froze. Slowly, I looked over my shoulder... nothing.\nI checked the whole damn yard still nothing.\nThen I muttered to myself,\n\"Holy sht... this place is f**king haunted. And I'm here just trying to relax for once.\n\nI slipped the old letter back exactly where I found it.\nI didn\u2019t want anything to do with that paranormal sh*t.\n\nA week later, I packed up and moved to a different town.\nBut even now, I can\u2019t shake the feeling.\nI still haven\u2019t had a decent night\u2019s sleep since. But atleast im starting to see his truth now."},"74":{"title":"Forgot","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1k9k10j\/forgot\/","flair":"Images & Comics","author":"Misterio-Cosmico661","selftext":"I invite you to read my little book of stories called enchiridion \nhttps:\/\/www.wattpad.com\/story\/393316150?utm_source=android&utm_medium=link&utm_content=story_info&wp_page=story_details_button&wp_uname=RorFort222\n\nIt is a continuation of the book Leviathan \nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/olvid-KyWMUm8\n\n"},"75":{"title":"Can someone explain why people can be","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1k92q35\/can_someone_explain_why_people_can_be\/","flair":"Trollpasta Story","author":"Wormydog1724","selftext":"Hello everyone!

Still a lot of unpacking to do, and to be honest, I think Emma is a little disappointed with the place but trying to hide it. It\u2019s the best I could afford without completely draining my savings, and it's not like Emma is in any state to work at 7 months pregnant. It\u2019s so strange seeing such a petite little body with such a big bump. She looks like she\u2019s trying to smuggle a watermelon under her shirt. I\u2019m trying not to bring attention to it cause I know she\u2019s insecure. When we were unpacking clothes earlier, she pulled out her old cheerleading uniform.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you bring that?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Just for memories, I guess?\u201d She shrugged, tracing the emblem on the top. I placed a hand on her stomach then and kissed her.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey, when that little lady\u2019s out of there, you\u2019ll fit right back into it.\u201d I told her, a hand on her cheek.\n\n\u201cYou think so?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing you slip back into it.\u201d I winked.\n\nShe smiled then, and we went back to unpacking before exploring the neighborhood. It seemed quiet, maybe more people would be out if it wasn\u2019t 28 degrees. The only person we saw out was an older guy shoveling his driveway. He had this white-gray hair that reached just below his ear, and wore these small rectangular glasses. He seemed like a bookish guy, wearing a thick beige cardigan and sporting rough salt and pepper stubble. He paused his shoveling when he saw us. His eyes kept darting to Emma\u2019s swollen belly.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey there, we\u2019re the new neighbors at 2169. I\u2019m Martin, and this is Emma.\u201d I said. He cleared his throat gruffly.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Robert. Rob.\u201d He said. The awkward silence hung in the chilly air until Emma spoke.\n\n\u201cHave you lived in the neighborhood long?\u201d She asked. He cleared his throat again, his big pale blue eyes examining Emma and me, like he was figuring something out.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou know there aren\u2019t any schools close to here, right?\u201d He asked, licking his lips. I pulled Emma in to a half hug beside me.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah, you know we\u2019ve got some years before she\u2019ll start school, so we've got some time to figure that out,\u201d I said with an uncomfortable smile. He kept staring at Emma. I mean, she\u2019s a cute little thing,\u00a0 but it was like he was trying to saw her in half just by looking at her.\n\n\u201cYoung wombs are fickle.\u201d He said suddenly and starkly. Emma gasped, taken aback by the weight of the statement. She looked to me for action.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWatch for fucking mouth,\u201d I warned him. He shook his head, I\u2019m not sure at what, and headed back inside his garage, closing the door behind him.\u00a0\n\nEmma and I walked back in a stunned silence, opting to not meet any of the other neighbors. When we got back to our house, Emma spoke for the first time.\n\n\u201cThe nine is upside down.\u201d She said.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I replied but then saw what she meant. The \u201c9\u201d of our \u201c2169\u201d house numbers had lost the top nail that kept it upright, so only the bottom remained, making the nine hang as a \"6\" instead.\n\n\u201cCan you fix that? They might mix up our mail with that creepy guy\u2019s.\u201d She said, and I realized she was right, Rob\u2019s house was 2166. I patted her head.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll get on it, let\u2019s get you inside and out of this cold first.\u201d\n\nWe went inside, and I tried to cheer Emma up with hot chocolate and some foot rubs, but I think that weirdos cryptic words really got to her. She was fussy with her swollen belly practically every second. We opted to go to bed earlier tonight since we needed to try to get the good majority of unpacking done tomorrow, since Monday, I\u2019d be starting my new job.\u00a0\n\nAs I was pulling the blinds closed with Emma tucked in the bed, I noticed someone who seemed to be looking at us. I didn\u2019t tell Emma cause I think she would\u2019ve freaked out, and I\u2019m honestly probably giving it too much attention altogether. There\u2019s this sad little park across from our home, it\u2019s got like one rusty jungle jim and one of those metal slides that burn your ass when you go down it in the summer. There\u2019s a light in the park, which is the only reason I could see this figure in the snowy dark. I think it was a woman, dressed in some kind of big dark cloak, and she had this long black hair that covered most of her face. She was looking at our house, I think. For like hours. I\u2019ve been journaling and getting up to check every once in a while to see if she\u2019s there, and she is. Well, she left for like 20-45 minutes, I think. It was around the same time I heard something in the backyard but to be honest I was to chickenshit to check. It sounded like a person crunching around in the snow, and then leaving. Then, when I checked again, she was back at her post watching the house. She left eventually, though I didn\u2019t see her go. I think it might\u2019ve been a druggie or something out in the snow. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going to bed.\u00a0\n\nJan 14th, 2024\n\nDear Journal,\u00a0\n\nToday was mostly uneventful. Emma seemed in better spirits as we unpacked and played music, taking breaks to dance around the boxes. That was until Emma heard something in the backyard. It sounded like something rhythmically banging against hollow metal. We went out to the backyard and searched around, but the only place to check was the little dust-covered shed that sat sadly in the yard.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s up there!\u201d\n\nEmma pointed to the tree that sat in the left corner of our yard, and I saw what she meant. Tied up in the branches was an aluminum pie tin dangling from a string, the string had been tied in a knot around the branch, and on the other end, opposite and banging into the pie tin was a little black bag,\u00a0 the two meeting over and over again like a makeshift gong.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d I wondered aloud, thinking of the strange girl I saw the night before.\u00a0\n\n\u201cCan you get it?\u201d Emma asked. I fought back a groan. I didn\u2019t feel like climbing a tree.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll probably just fall on its own eventually, Em,\u201d I told her. She gave me pleading eyes.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat sounds gonna drive me nuts, Martin.\u201d She whined. I rolled my eyes but gave in. The banging was escalating, into a faster tempo despite the wind not picking up. It *was* getting pretty annoying. As I climbed the branches, the tempo became unbearable, like it was bouncing around in my skull. When I glanced down, I saw that Emma was clutching her ears with both hands, willing the sound not to enter.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know what came over me, scrambling so haphazardly up the tree like I was, but I just needed sound to stop. So when I was finally within reach of that little black bag, I grabbed at it without really thinking. I cried out as I did, feeling something sharp penetrate my flesh, and in a knee-jerk reaction, tossed the bag and the tin down to the ground. I heard a little yelp spring from Emma.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d I called down and began to scramble down the tree.\n\n\"You threw it at me, jerk!\"\n\nWhen I reached her, she showed me her right cheek had a small slice across it, bright scarlet trickling down. I looked at my hand and showed her I had similar cuts across the palm. We were more cautious now as we picked up the little black bag by the string that attached it to the pie tin. It had nails and small razor blades poking out of it. We brought it inside and found the contents of the bag troubling to say the least. It had the nails and razor blades, but also had dirt, hair, and human teeth.\u00a0 I moved to throw it away, but Emma got in my way.\u00a0\n\n\u201cShould we call the police?\u201d She asked. I didn\u2019t want to. I didn\u2019t want to start this new chapter with police cars. I don\u2019t ever wanna see police cars again. However, Emma\u2019s eyes were begging me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do you one better. I\u2019ll bring it to the station on my way to work tomorrow.\u201d I told her. She nodded, satisfied, I think, and went to grab antiseptic for our cuts. While she was gone, I threw the thing in the garbage disposal and shredded it. I\u2019m sure it was some weird prank and nothing more. I just want that to be the end of it.\u00a0\n\nJan. 15th\n\nEmma lost the baby today.\n\nJan. 21st\n\nRan a bath for Emma today. When she tried to drain it there was a clog. I took the pipe apart to see what had gummed up the works. There was an impossible amount of black hair, and even more unbelievably, a note, completely dry in the water pipe. It read \u201cPut her back together.\u201d"},"79":{"title":"Blood Bathed Barn","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1k9875j\/blood_bathed_barn\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"TheFirstIdiotKid","selftext":"Im Peter, im writing in this journal to inform you that they are coming.

Im the one that made this happen. I used some of the money and donated it to cancer treatment. Kind right? they used my money and accidentally created it. It escaped and not to cause panic they made their worst mistake. Did not tell anyone. No one but the top class people (leaders goverment etc.) know. So all of this happened im writing to say im sorry i didnt inspect further. I could have easily stopped it and now im going to die.

She would meet me at the end of her driveway, standing there, in a pose, like the paparazzi was taking her picture. She would do this to make me laugh because she believed everyone should start their day with a smile. This routine went on for months until one day, she was standing there, but she wasn\u2019t posing. She was slouching, it looked like she was falling asleep while standing. I walked up with a smile on my face. \u201cReady for the day?\u201d I asked. \u201cSure.\u201d her answer was nonchalant. I didn\u2019t want to pry, so on our walk to school, I tried to just talk about random things. I talked about prom and the homecoming game. Nothing seemed to get her out of this mood she was in. At least, I thought it was just a mood.\u00a0\n\nThe end of the day came, and I looked for her so we could start our journey back home. She wasn\u2019t waiting for me by her classroom like normal. *\u2018Where is she\u2019* I thought to myself. I walked down the hallway and out of the front door of the school. I look around and spot her. She was sitting on a bench by herself on the other side of the parking lot. She seemed more out of it now than she was at the beginning of the day. This was my best friend, and I was concerned. I walked over to her and grabbed her hand to help her up. \u201cNo!\u201d she pulled her hand back. I looked at her, confused. Her voice sounded guttural and raspy. \u201cAlly, are you alright? You\u2019re scaring me.\u201d I said. She just looked at me. Her eyes dark, no color or pupils. Just black. I left her there and ran the \u00bc mile back home. I busted through the door, slammed it shut, and locked it. \u201cAre you being chased?\u201d My mom asked. \u201cSomething's wrong with Ally. Her eyes are lifeless.\u201d My mom shrugged it off, thinking maybe we were fighting again. I went up the stairs to my room, pulled my phone out, and got on social media. I looked at Ally\u2019s profile. Her bio said, \u2018We are watching.\u2019 *\u2018Who are we?\u2019* I thought. I exited the app and went downstairs. My mom was sitting on the couch watching TV. \u201cMom, something is really wrong with Ally.\u201d I pleaded. \u201cY'all will be fine, and make up tomorrow like y'all always do.\u201d My mom said nonchalantly. She doesn't believe me. \u201cTake me over there.\u201d I said. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d \u201cIf you're not going to believe me, take me to Ally's house.\u201d She agreed and grabbed her keys.\u00a0\n\nWe pulled up to the house, and it looked like no one had lived there in ages. The grass is 3\u2019 tall, and one of the windows is boarded up. \u201cMom, what is happening?\u201d \u201cThat's the abandoned house on our road.\u201d \u201cNo, mom, that's Ally's house.\u201d \u201cWho is Ally?\u201d My heart sank into my stomach. Now my mom doesn't remember. \u201cLet's just go back home.\u201d I looked down at my feet on the floorboard. My mom turned the car around and drove back home. As soon as we pulled into the driveway, I got out of the car, ran inside and up the stairs to my room. I started searching for Ally on all social platforms, her profiles were gone. Now confused, I turned off my phone and grabbed a backpack. I put a flashlight, water, and some snacks in it. I snuck out of my house and started walking down towards Ally's house. I needed answers.\n\n\u00a0I got to Ally's house and made my way through the thick brown grass growing in the yard. I got to the front door and tried the handle, it was locked. I went to the back door, hoping that it would be unlocked so I could get inside and investigate. The door opened with a squeal. I cringed and looked around to make sure no one heard it. I walked in, and the floors were dusty, no footprints, no furniture. It doesn't make any sense. I walked through the house to Ally's room. I open the door, and there is a stench. Like mold had been growing. I gag and then hold my nose with my fingers. I walked in the room, and the walls looked like they were leaking. But it wasn't water. It was black and gooey. Like something out of a horror movie. I looked around for any clues I could find. I see footprints leading to the closet. I opened the door, and the stench was even stronger. I almost couldn't bear it. I kept holding my nose and looked around the closet. The footprints disappeared by the left side of the closet. I started touching the walls, hoping I'd find an entrance or something. Somewhere Ally went that made sense. I pushed on the back wall, and it gave way. I found the edge of a panel and pulled it off. I tossed it aside and crawled into the space.\u00a0\n\nThe black goo was everywhere. It was so slippery I couldn't stand up. \u201cI guess I\u2019m crawling.\u201d I said to myself. I crawled through the goo, and the tunnel I was in seemed to get darker the further I went. I looked back to make sure I could still see the light coming in through the hole from the closet. It was getting further and further away. I got my flashlight out of my backpack. I didn't know what this place was, but I was determined to find Ally. \\*Splash splash splash\\* I heard something else crawling around in the dark. But it sounded like it was coming towards me. I braced myself for whatever was coming. It got a few feet in front of me and stopped. I pointed my flashlight in the direction it was coming from. I caught a glimmer of what looked like long black hair and the pink nail polish Ally always wore. \u201cAlly!\u201d I yelled before I could even stop myself. The thing came even closer to me. \u201cWho is Ally?\u201d It asked in a low guttural growl. \u201cYou're Ally.\u201d I said with tears welling up in my eyes. \u201cAlly doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d It laughed in my face. I start crawling backwards, away from whatever the hell has taken over Ally\u2019s body. It starts crawling towards me. \u201cWhere are you going, bestie?\u201d It was mocking me. It grabbed my arm as it tried pulling me further into the tunnel. I kept moving backwards towards the entrance to the closet. It continued holding onto me, and we were in a tug of war as I kept moving backwards. The light started getting brighter in the tunnel, and I could see its entire face. It had black veins popping up towards the surface of its skin. Its eyes are solid black, no pupils. Its mouth open, revealing rotting teeth with black goo pouring out. I shiver with disgust.\u00a0\n\nRight before we get to the entrance, it lets go, scurrying back into the tunnel's blackness. I put the panel back and ran home as fast as I could. I rush into the house, and my mom is standing near the stairs. \u201cWhere have you been and what is all over your clothes?\u201d \u201cI found her mom, or it, I should say.\u201d \u201cYou found who or what?\u201d \u201cAlly, Mom.\u201d My mom looked at me with confusion. \u201cI don\u2019t know what has gotten into you, but this Ally obsession needs to stop. Go get some rest, and we will call a therapist tomorrow.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t need a therapist, Mom. I need someone to listen to me. We may need a priest.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t argue, just go get some rest.\u201d I rolled my eyes and went upstairs.\u00a0\n\nI went into the bathroom and started getting ready to take a shower. I looked in the mirror at myself. \\*\u2018This can\u2019t be real.\u2019\\* I splashed some water on my face. As I stood back up from the sink, I glanced down at my arm in my reflection. I saw a dark spot where that thing was holding onto me. \u201cOH MY GOSH!\u201d I screamed. \\*\\\\\\*knock knock knock\\\\\\*\\* \u201cHoney, are you okay?\u201d My mom's voice frantically rang through the door. I opened the door and showed her my arm. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing there, what is it?\u201d I looked down at my arm and didn\u2019t see anything. I looked at my mom with a confused expression. \u201cNever mind, I\u2019m going to shower.\u201d I closed the bathroom door and turned the shower on. \\*\u2018We are waiting for you\u2019\\* I heard a faint whisper in my ear. I turned the shower off and listened closely but didn't hear anything else. I shake it off as my mind playing tricks on me. I take a deep breath and turn the shower back on. I take my shower and get out. After getting dressed, I go to my room, lie down, and go to sleep.\u00a0  \n  \nA stinging in my arm jolts me awake. I grab it with my other hand and feel roughness. I jump out of bed and turn the light on. \u201cAhhhh!\u201d I scream. I hear footsteps ascending the stairs. My mom busts through the door with a bat in her hands. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201d she blurts. \u201cWhat is happening to your arm?!\u201d \u201cSo this is real, I\u2019m not hallucinating?!\u201d My mom grabbed my arm, as I tried not to faint, and led me down the stairs in a hurry. \u201cPut your shoes on, now.\u201d she sternly said. I hurry and put my shoes on. She slides on her house shoes, grabs her keys, and leads me to the car. \u201cWhere are we going? I have school tomorrow.\u201d My mom drives without saying a word.\u00a0  \n  \nWe pulled up to urgent care. \u201cThey aren\u2019t going to be able to do anything, Mom.\u201d \u201cHow do you know?\u201d \u201cThis is otherworldly.\u201d \u201cJust get out of the car, and let's go inside.\u201d I listened to her and got out of the car. We get inside, and she grabs my arm and pulls me to the front desk. \u201cLook at this!\u201d The receptionist looks at my arm in confusion. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d she asks. My mom looks down at my arm, and the black veins are gone. My mom turns my arm around, inspecting it. \\*\u2018They were just here.\u2019\\* she says under her breath. My mom sighed. \u201cNever mind, I guess I was having a nightmare. Let\u2019s go, Lacie.\u201d We get in the car to head home. \u201cI don\u2019t know what is going on. Are you intentionally doing these things?\u201d \u201cNo, Mom. I saw Ally, and since then, my arm has been hurting off and on, I have no idea why.\u201d \u201cThere you go again with this Ally thing. Who is Ally? Why do you keep talking about her? I thought you outgrew imaginary friends. You\u2019re 16. Unless you\u2019re a medium and can talk to spirits.\u201d \u201cMom, I know you don\u2019t remember, but Ally was my best friend since kindergarten. She disappeared from everywhere, and now I\u2019m the only person who remembers her.\u201d \u201cI think you need to talk to a professional. I will book an appointment for tomorrow, You won\u2019t be going to school.\u201d I just stare out the window while she drives us home.\u00a0  \n  \nWe pull onto our street, and my mom slams on her brakes. I turn my head towards her suddenly. \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d She just points forward towards the windshield. I slowly turn my head towards whatever she is pointing at. \u201cThat\u2019s Ally, Mom.\u201d Ally is standing in the middle of the road, her hair covering her face. She\u2019s wearing a band t-shirt and skinny jeans with black goo dripping off of her. Ally starts slowly walking towards the car. \u201cDrive, Mom!\u201d I frantically say. \u201cGo around her!!\u201d My mom is just frozen with fear. I shake my mom. \u201cMOM! SHE\u2019S GOING TO GET US!!\u201d My mom snapped out of it and started driving, swerving around Ally. Ally reaches her hands out towards the car when we pass. My mom speeds into the driveway. \u201cLet\u2019s get inside.\u201d She said with urgency in her voice. I get out of the car as fast as I can. \u201cCome on, mom! Unlock the door!\u201d My mom rushes to the door, key in hand. She jams it into the door and unlocks it. We both bust through the door and try to close it as fast as we can.\u00a0\n\nRight before the door closes, a pale arm with black veins all over it reaches inside. My mom and I lean against the door, using all of our strength to close it, but it\u2019s not enough. The thing is too strong and shoves the door open, knocking me and my mom to the ground. I get back up and pull my mom off the floor as fast as I can. \u201cRUN, MOM! IT WANTS ME, NOT YOU!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not leaving you!\u201d My mom grabs the umbrella sitting against the railing of the stairs and points it towards Ally. \u201cCome on motherfucker!\u201d I look at my mom, shock across my face. I had never seen her like this. I look back at the doorway, and Ally is coming through the door. Her feet dangling in the air as she glides toward us. My mom impaled her chest with the umbrella. Ally lets out a screech, the umbrella stuck in her chest. She pulls it out, and black goo gushes from the wound. I gag and stop myself from retching. Ally fixes her gaze on me, getting faster as she approaches. I grab my mom's keys from the floor and stab Ally in the side of the neck as she wraps her arms around me and tries to take me to the ground. She wails in pain and lets go of me. She pulls the keys from her neck and throws them over us. \u201cI think we are just pissing it off mom!\u201d I yell, as my dad rounds the corner from the kitchen. He sees what\u2019s happening and goes and gets a crucifix and his bible. He comes back and starts reciting bible verses while holding the crucifix out towards Ally. Ally falls to the ground and screams, covering her ears. My dad continues and walks up to Ally and puts the crucifix on her forehead. It starts smoking, and I see the crucifix embedding into her skin as it melts. My dad continues reciting, \u201cSaint Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil; May God rebuke him, we humbly pray; And do thou, O Prince of the Heavenly Host, by the power of God, thrust into hell Satan and all evil spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls. Amen.\u201d I watch as Ally\u2019s skin starts turning back to its normal shade and the black veins start dissipating.\u00a0\n\nAlly starts sobbing. \u201cWhat is happening to me?\u201d She lets out a cry. I put my hand on her shoulder. \u201cNothing, now. You\u2019re okay.\u201d She gets up off the floor and hugs me. \u201cWhere are your parents, Ally?\u201d My mom chimes in. \u201c...I\u2026..I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember.\u201d Ally says with hesitation. \u201cWell, that\u2019s alright. You can stay with us until everything is settled. It\u2019ll give us a reason to use the extra bed that no one has slept in for ages.\u201d My mom responds. I take Ally upstairs and give her a change of clothes. \u201cGo take a shower, and then you can rest.\u201d I lead Ally to the bathroom. As Ally takes her shower, I start looking things up on the internet about evil spirits and what happens to the family when someone gets possessed. Ally comes into my room. \u201cMaybe your parents moved away after everything happened.\u201d I said. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t remember what happened. All I remember is waking up one day and not feeling like myself, and then after that, nothing.\u201d I put my hand on her arm. \u201cWe are going to figure this out.\u201d I said softly. Ally lies down in my bed and starts drifting off to sleep. I go downstairs and help my mom clean up the mess that was made from our altercation. \u201cHer parents, they were Jen and Tom, right?\u201d I was so happy. My mom remembered. \u201cYes!\u201d I blurted. I wrapped my mom in a tight hug. \u201cOkay, Lacie.\u201d she says with a laugh. We finish cleaning up.\u00a0  \n  \n\\*\\\\\\*knock knock knock\\\\\\*\\* My mom and I look at each other, confused. \u2018\\*It\u2019s detective stevenson with the sheriff's office.\u2019\\* We hear a voice call out from the other side of the door. My mom opens it. We stand there together in the doorway. \\*\u2018We had a noise complaint, said it sounded like someone was being murdered. Is it okay if we come in and take a look around?\u2019\\* \u201cSure, come on in. Just please try to stay quiet. My husband just went back to bed, and my daughter's best friend is asleep upstairs.\u201d \\*\u2018No problem, ma\u2019am.\u2019\\* The sheriff and his deputy come in and look around. They look in every room in the house and find nothing. \\*\u2018I guess it was just a concerned neighbor or prank call. Sorry for the disturbance, ma\u2019am.\u2019\\* The sheriff says as he walks towards the door. \\*\u2018Ya\u2019ll have a good evening.\u2019\\* he and his deputy leave. \u201cAlright, Mom, I\u2019m going to sleep. I love you, good night.\u201d I say as I work my way up the stairs. \u201cGood night sweetheart, if you need anything, let me know.\u201d I get in bed next to Ally and drift off to sleep.\u00a0  \n  \n\u201cLACIE, LACIE!\u201d I get pulled out of my haze by Ally\u2019s voice, and I\u2019m standing over her.\u00a0  \n  \n\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d Ally asks.\n\nI shake my head. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I say sleepily. \u201cYou were standing over me, whispering with a blank stare.\u201d \u201cWhat was I saying?\u201d I asked. \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand you.\u201d\u00a0\n\nI check my phone and look at the time. *\u20183:33 A.M.\u2019* I shake my head again and lay down in bed. I fall back asleep. I rolled over in my sleep and felt wetness. I jumped up. It\u2019s dark, my room is gone and I can\u2019t see anything. I feel a sharp pain in my arm again. I touch it to feel the black veins forming yet again. \u201cI knew you\u2019d come back.\u201d A deep, haunting voice comes from the darkness, laughing. Something inside of me takes control, and I start gliding further into the darkness\u2026.."},"82":{"title":"I Work for a Government Agency (We Hunt Monsters) pt.2","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1k95o8n\/i_work_for_a_government_agency_we_hunt_monsters\/","flair":"Very Short Story","author":"Sad_Advice_7783","selftext":"After the chupacabra incident, we barely had time to breathe before another call came in.\nThis time, from deep in the forests of Canada.\nA remote mining camp had gone silent.

A beautiful place, with small streams, a large lake, children running from one side to the other.\n\nBut there was a boy there who didn't mix with any other children. This boy was the laughing stock of the group, not only by the children, but also by the camp counselors. His name was Jason Voorhees.\n\nJason had a small condition: one side of his face had no movement because of a stroke he had when he was 8 years old. Since then, Pamela, his mother, took care of him so he could have a normal life, but that wasn't the case most of the time.\n\nJason was forced to stay at summer camp because his mother needed to work away for some time. But for Jason, it was difficult and painful to stay there and be excluded from the other students at the camp.\n\nJudith was a beautiful girl, with blue eyes and blood-red hair. She was a popular girl, everyone wanted to be around her, and she was always surrounded by her friends, people who weren't that nice to the other students. Jason saw Judith with charming eyes; every time she passed by him, her eyes sparkled, as if she had seen something far beyond a simple girl.\n\nHowever, soon after, he was a laughing stock. \"What are you looking at, freak?\" one of his friends said to Jason. \"Stop it, Michael, leave him alone\", said Judith.\n\nThe anger that Jason felt for being laughed at, for not being taken seriously, for people making fun of his condition... He was still a human being who just wanted to be treated like everyone else.\n\nBut Jason had one person there who he got along with: Elena Vargas. Elena was one of the camp monitors, she was in the medical wing, always prepared to care for all the students. Every time Jason arrived injured as a result of other students' bad jokes, Elena took care of him and gave him advice. Jason saw her as a kind of caregiver, a person who played the role of his mother there at the camp. He felt protected around her. But not everything was rosy for Jason; she was the only person who treated him well. Not even the monitors and the director took him seriously.\n\nOne night, Jason was sleeping when Judith woke him up.\n\n\"Come with me, Jason. We'll go to the lake for a little swim, come with us.\"\n\nJason, delighted to see her, didn't even think twice, got up and went with her.\n\n\"I know my friends don't like you, Jason, that they make fun of you. But I want to redeem myself, I want them to see you as I do: a sweet boy.\"\n\nThese words, for Jason, were all he wanted to hear from Judith, as he had feelings for her. His eyes didn't leave her the entire way, until they arrived at the lake.\n\n\"Hey Jason, I want to apologize for everything. I know I was a jerk to you, I think we can be friends from now on.\" \n\nMichael apologized to Jason for everything, as did everyone else.\n\nEveryone jumped into the water, only Jason was left out. \n\n\"Jump, Jason, the water's good,\" Michael shouted to Jason.\n\n\"It's okay, Jason, you can come, we're with you\", replied Judith.\n\nJason didn't know how to swim, but he knew that he had friends now, that he would no longer be a laughing stock, that nothing bad would happen to him.\n\nAt that moment, Jason let out a smile that he hadn't let out in a long time. Since he was 8 years old, Jason hasn't smiled anymore, because instead of happiness came insecurity and fear of not being accepted by society, due to his condition.\n\nThen, with confidence, he jumped into the water. His confidence soon turned to despair as no one was there to save him from drowning. Those who were now his friends came out of the water; It was all a big joke, a big fatal joke.\n\nJason struggled in the water; Outside, everyone was laughing, but Judith looked on with concern.\n\n\"Okay, let's get him out of the water, he's going to drown,\" she said.\n\n\"Calm down, we'll get him out quickly. Wait a little longer, it's really cool\", Michael said, laughing.\n\nJason sinks into the lake. Judith jumps into the water to find Jason, but she doesn't find him.\n\nWhat was laughter turned into worry and despair. Everyone jumped into the water, but everything was in vain, no one found Jason's body.\n\nA few hours later, the police arrived and did a large search of the lake. The camp was chaos, curious children everywhere, monitors running to catch all the students.\n\nWhen morning came, divers pulled Jason's body from the river. His body, now cold and lifeless, no longer had a soul, but just another lost body. A child lost his life due to discrimination and bad jokes.\n\nJason's mother arrived shortly after they found her son's body. His tears fell all over Jason's face; a feeling of pain, sadness and anger took over his heart.\n\n\"You killed my son. You killed my only son, and you will pay for it. One by one you will feel the pain that my son felt.\"\n\nA few days have passed since Jason's death. The camp returned to normal, still with that feeling of loss in the air.\n\nJudith and her friends began to be tried for Jason's death. Now they were responsible for the boy's death. Everyone looked at them angrily for what happened.\n\nAnd everything became even more chaotic in the following days. One night, a car stopped in front of the camp. One of the monitors thought it was strange and went to check it out. Coming closer, he saw someone inside. The door opened, the person got out of the car and, with a well-aimed blow, killed the monitor.\n\nThat day was known as the great Camp Cristal Lake massacre.\n\nPamela Voorhees murdered all the students and monitors. Only one person survived all of this: Elena Vargas. She confronted Pamela at the edge of the lake and thus managed to defeat her.\n\nIn desperation, Elena got into a boat on the lakeshore. \n\nShe said she was in the middle of the river when she saw Jason come out of the water and pull her into the depths.\n\nElena was found in time floating in the water.\n\nSince then, some things have not made sense over time. Jason's grave was opened and his body stolen; They never found him and, soon after, Pamela murdered everyone in the camp.\n\nElena Vargas returned to her normal life. She went to work in a hospital as a nurse. After a few days of going to work, his colleagues reported him missing. In a search of her home, she was found hanging from the ceiling fan.\n\nWith all the investigations, they came to the conclusion that she took her own life.\n\nNeighbors reported seeing a man in front of her house a few times. He was always standing there, without any reaction. It was impossible to see his face as he had a cloth over his head.\n\nElena was buried in the same cemetery as Jason. Perhaps, as fate would have it, she was placed in a tomb next to him.\n\nElena was the only person who was good to Jason. Her sweet way of caring, her words to comfort him, made her a protector.\n\nBut, like every true story, it also has some superstitions. Jason couldn't bear to see his mother die at the hands of the one who cared for him when he needed support most. The one who, for him, was like a second mother. He had to kill her to avenge his mother's death. \n\nLegend has it that Jason hears his mother's voice saying, \"Kill them, son. Kill them all.\""},"86":{"title":"The origin of hachishakusama","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1k92h95\/the_origin_of_hachishakusama\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Theredrunner1907","selftext":"The Woman from the Village\n(Origin story of Hachishakusama)\n\nDeep within the heart of Japan, hidden by ancient forests, there once stood a forgotten village.

But by night... something changed.\n\nWhispers began to spread among the villagers. They spoke of shadows that stretched too long, of a heavy, distant thumping that echoed through the trees. Children spoke fearfully of a tall figure watching them from the darkness, her face obscured by a wide white hat.\n\nOne night, a child vanished.\nBy morning, he was found \u2014 alive, but pale and trembling with fear. What he told made the blood run cold: the kind woman had changed. She had grown impossibly tall, her arms thin like dead branches, her voice a low, chilling \"po... po... po...\" drifting through the forest.\n\nThe village elders knew what had to be done. Without a word, they led the woman deep into the woods \u2014 farther than any map would go. She was forbidden to return. But she never truly disappeared...\n\nThey say she still roams the forests, taller than any tree, waiting silently.

Locals remembered her as cold, mechanical \u2014 perfect on paper, but wrong somehow. Her uniform was spotless. Her hands, precise. Her smile, thin and brittle like old glass.\n\nOver the years, an unusual number of babies died under her care. Always the frailest ones, always with no clear explanation. Parents grieved. Doctors signed death certificates. No one dared question Evelyn. It was easier to believe in bad luck than in something darker.\n\nThen came Charlotte \u2014 a woman of influence and iron will. She gave birth to a healthy child at Evelyn\u2019s hospital, but within days, her baby was dead.\n\nUnlike the others, Charlotte refused to accept the neat, quiet tragedy handed to her. At her child\u2019s funeral, standing alone over the tiny grave, she whispered a curse \u2014 not in anger, but in grief so deep it scraped the marrow of her bones.\n\nThe air itself seemed to recoil from her words. The ground split with hairline cracks. Something ancient and violent stirred. Reality frayed like rotting cloth, and through the tear, something came \u2014 something that had been waiting for the right opening, something hungry for pain.\n\nThat night, Evelyn felt it.\n\nThe curse found her in the nursery, where she sat alone, meticulously folding a blanket no one would ever use. The walls around her buckled, warping and bleeding shadows. Invisible hands gripped her, dragging her across the broken threshold between worlds.\n\nShe tried to scream, but the curse forced every stolen cry, every mother\u2019s sob, back down her throat. Her body twisted \u2014 joints cracking backward, bones warping under the strain. Her once-immaculate skin shriveled like paper left too close to a flame, her eyes sinking deep into hollows that wept black tears.\n\nThe spirits of the lost children clung to her, stitched into her very flesh, their tiny hands clawing and pulling. Their sorrow became her marrow, their agony her blood.\n\nShe became something else. Something the world had no name for.\n\nThey call her The Cradle Witch now.\n\nSince then, stories have spread: of a gaunt figure cradling invisible infants in the abandoned wings of hospitals, of soft lullabies sung in a voice cracked and raw. Of a presence that comes to those drowning in guilt and shame.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t speak. She only rocks back and forth, humming a broken tune, until the crying stops.\n\nBut it\u2019s not the child\u2019s cries that end. It\u2019s yours.\n\nIf you ever hear the soft creak of a rocking chair in an empty room, don\u2019t look.\nIf you see pale hands reaching out from the shadows, don\u2019t answer.\nShe\u2019s still searching \u2014 for those who cannot carry their sorrow any longer \u2014 so she can carry it for them.\n\nForever.\n"},"88":{"title":"It came from the fog.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1k8y7ft\/it_came_from_the_fog\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"Lew1sGibson","selftext":"\"Get up, Brennan, this is the third time this month!\"\n\n\n\nThis was the last thing I heard as an employee of the Bristleton Hotel, and to be fair, I couldn't blame Claire, she was my boss. She was just doing her job, and I clearly wasn't competent enough at mine. When I wasn't cleaning hotel rooms during the day, I was putting up with drunk losers who make triple my salary demanding more shots from the other side of the bar. If you cant tell, that doesn't leave too much room for me to sleep, and the comfortable hotel bedrooms that I definitely couldn't afford to be in during normal circumstances, were just too alluring for me to resist sometimes. \n\n\n\nI drove home early that day in my 2007 Toyota Camry, it wasn't exactly a Ferrari, but it got me from point A to point B, and that's all I really need. Well, needed, I doubt I'll be driving to the hotel anymore after I decided that 2pm was naptime. The drive home was like every other, just a few hours earlier than I anticipated. A thick fog coated the area, reminding me of Silent Hill, a reference which makes me feel old for even thinking of.\n\nI sat in the car, blasting music with my windows down, tapping the steering wheel to the beat.\n\n\n\nIt was only once the song finished, that I realised just how quiet it was. I don't just mean the roads, I mean everything. No singing mockingbirds, no cyclists, hell, not even any insects blindly smashing into my already filthy windshield. It almost felt like a blessing at first, I slowed down the car, just wanting to enjoy the brief calmness before the storm that I knew was waiting for me back at my place.\n\n\n\nI pulled over on a dilapidated country road on the route home, getting out of the car .It was my final drive home from the hotel, I might as well take my time and enjoy my victory lap, I thought to myself. I pulled out a creased pack of cigarettes from my coat pocket. I hardly considered myself a smoker, but one every now and again they helped take the edge off. \n\nI stared out into the distant fog. It relaxed me at first, but after a while, something changed. It started to hurt, like I was looking at something my brain was struggling to understand. I just wanted to toss it up to the damp, discoloured, cigarette, but something just didn't feel quite right. It was time for me to get back on the road, I didn't know much, but that, that I did know\n\n\n\nA quarter of an hour later, I pulled in to my driveway. Good god, I needed to mow the lawn at some point, it was getting close to being legally considered a jungle. As I walked down towards my house, my eyes peered to my right. My neighbour was fast asleep on his porch chair, but I had no idea how he wasn't awoken by my loud-ass car pulling into the driveway. Not that I was complaining, there's only so many of his 'back in my day' rants I can handle before I start feel sleepy myself. After a turn of the key and a few shoulder barges, my door squeaked open. I really needed to get the hinges fixed, turns out, WD40 doesn't actually fix everything. I headed to the fridge, hoping for a quick snack. Upon opening, I saw what I thought was  some sort of red smoothie. I sure as hell didn't make it, so I assumed my sister made it before heading to school. She was more into the healthy stuff than I was. I had a sip. It tasted absolutely foul, almost metallic. It probably had some sort of health benefit, but I didn't want any part of it, so I put it back where I found it.\n\n\n\nI browsed LinkedIn for about an hour after that, searching for a day job that paid anything above minimum wage. Just when I thought I was finally getting somewhere, the universe gave me a giant middle finger. My internet connection was gone. At this point, I could only laugh at my own misfortune. I lived deep in rural Nevada, and whilst we aren't still living like we are in the wild west, id be lying if I said that the internet connection was perfect, so I wasn't exactly surprised. I took it as a sign and decided to call it a night on the job search. I checked the time, 7:30. Better make some dinner, I thought.\n\n\n\nI was no chef, but I could make a mean plain boiled pasta, or so I've heard. I filled a pot with a healthy serving of fusilli, as I planned on saving some for my lunch tomorrow. I carried the pot to the other end of my cramped kitchen, gently placing it down in the sink prior to turning the tap on to fill it with water.\n\n\n\nThat's when I noticed something odd.\n\n\n\nThe water, if you could even call it that, had a reddish-brown tint to it. At the time, I was more annoyed than concerned. Not only did I not have any drinking water, but it had also ruined some perfectly good pasta. I'd just call the water company in the morning, I thought. There had probably just been a leak in the pipes, or something. I'm not gonna pretend that I know anything about water or pipes. \n\n\n\nI carried the tainted pot into my front yard to scrape it into my already overflowing trash can, successfully managing to prevent any spillage; it was the little victories that counted. Just as I turned around to head back into my house, I noticed that my neighbours porch light was still on. Mr Pinney probably just forgot to turn it off when he went back inside, I assumed. As I got closer to his house, the situation just got increasingly weirder.\n\n\n\nMr Pinney was still sat on his porch chair, seemingly still fast asleep.\n\n\n\nConcerned, I hurriedly made my way towards my elderly neighbour, which is when I noticed just how deathly pale he was. He was never exactly tanned, but this just looked wrong, even just the sight of him made me feel queasy. I tried shouting his name, to no avail. Starting to feel a little unsettled, I shook him by his shoulders, causing his head to jolt back.\n\n\n\nI fell backwards after seeing his neck, I barely had enough strength to catch myself on the porch railing. He had a giant gash on his neck, deep enough to expose his windpipe. I stood there, urgently trying to catch my breath. Once I eventually recovered from the initial shock, the confusion set in.\n\n\n\nWhere the hell was all the blood?\n\n\n\nThis was a deep, wide cut, but not a single drop of blood could be seen on, or even around his body. Aside from the beer stains, his white shirt was spotless. It was like he was some sort of wax figure. Every litre, every gallon, was gone. \n\n\n\nHis dog sat cold and lifeless on his lap. I didn't know if it had the same fate as its owner, but I didn't have the heart or the balls to check.\n\nBefore I could even start to think about who did this, or how they did this, the porch light flickered, and then cut out, shrouding me and the pale, shrivelled husk that once was Mr Pinney in complete darkness. Not even the moon shone, not even it wanted to illuminate this horrific scene.\n\n\n\nIll be honest, I screamed like a little girl. I got up, making a break for the fence separating our properties, I refused to step into the fog on the street, knowing what could still be out there. Using one arm to propel myself, I just about conjured up enough strength to leap over the picket fence, with agility that in any other circumstance, id be pretty damn impressed with.\n\n\n\nI made it to my door, which I had idiotically not thought to lock when I left, and repeatedly thrusted into it, scolding myself for being too stingy to not get it fixed sooner. I pushed it open just wide enough for me to slide in sideways, and I wasted no time entering. Thankfully, it shut easier than it opened. I immediately looked for my phone, and dialled 911, having to take my time to enter the numbers because of my shaking fingers.\n\n\n\nMy heart dropped further than I already thought it could when my phone flashed up with an error message. No explanation given, just 'ERROR'.\n\nThe coincidences were just piling up, I fell backwards into my couch. I tried calling my sister, hell, I tried everyone. Every time, I just got the same damn error message.\n\n\n\nI knew I couldn't stay here. Whoever, or whatever, did this to my neighbour, probably knew I was here. I needed to go. I grabbed my car keys, and headed for the front door. Then I remembered, when I moved out, my father gifted me a gun. It was nothing fancy, just a colt 1911, but it was better than nothing. I grabbed it from the drawer in my bedside table. I'd never really used it before, and I was starting to regret not taking my dad's offer up for some training all those years ago.\n\n\n\nI crept downstairs, not wanting to make too much noise. Luckily, the door opened pretty easily this time, allowing me to sneak over to the car. I didn't even bother shutting the door, there was nothing in there of value anyway. I got in the car, turning the key. Something was wrong.\n\n\n\nI had no gas.\n\n\n\nI didn't understand, I had a full tank this morning, and I had only driven sixty miles to the hotel and back. The car wouldn't even start. Its not like I was running on fumes, it was like all the gasoline had just vanished, just like Mr Pinney's blood did, as much as I wanted it to be a coincidence, but the evidence was just piling up.\n\n\n\nThat's when it clicked.\n\n\n\nI didn't just stumble into a crime scene. Whatever did this, it wasn't gone. It was still here. It was messing with me, like some sick little game.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been locked in my car for the past 2 hours, writing this, hoping somebody will find it. To whoever is reading this, I have one piece of advice.\n\n\n\nDon't stare into the fog, you don't know what is staring back.\n\n\n\n"},"89":{"title":"Project 365","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1k90izf\/project_365\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"StepMountain9607","selftext":"I don\u2019t know if this story is classified under creepy pasta.

Talk to your friends about it, if they're good friends, they'll help you get over it. If your friends get tired of hearing about it, talk to your family. If your family doesn\u2019t want to hear about it, then go pay the money needed and seek a therapist. They\u2019re literally paid to listen. Do this, and you won\u2019t end up making the same mistake I made.\u00a0\n\nFirst, a little bit of background. My name is Nolan. I work as an aircraft mechanic and for a while, my life was pretty grand. I had a stable job, I was close to home and I had an amazing girlfriend. Ashley. She was a barista I had met at a country bar. I acted like a drunk fool, and in an attempt to impress her, I got on the bar\u2019s mechanical bull and after getting concussed, we were together.\u00a0\n\nThe next few months were magic. We did everything together, my friends loved her, my family loved her, I loved her. I know I might sound a bit crazy, but after month six I asked her to marry me. She said yes. I was in heaven and I was even happier when I was given an opportunity to move to California. I\u2019m from Virginia and have spent all my life on the east coast, so I jumped at the chance to see a new area.\u00a0\n\nMy plan was to get over to California, get a place big enough for the both of us, then take some time off of work to go back to Virginia, pick up Ashley, then\u00a0 go to California together. It took less than a month for everything to fall apart. Ashley was pretty distant after the first two weeks away from me. Then when it was time to go visit her, she wanted to call everything off.\u00a0\n\nShe said that she couldn\u2019t leave Virginia because it was all she knew and she couldn\u2019t leave her friends and family. She felt horrible that I was coming over to see her and thought that it was best that she tell me in person instead of over the phone because I deserved better. It\u2019s funny. I always heard the guys at work tell me how I gotta be careful of girls who\u2019d get with me just to leave their hometowns, never would I have thought that I would end up with the rare one out of ten who would have actually stayed here.\u00a0\n\nOf course, I was devastated. Here I was, thinking I met the one just for my heart to be torn. I wish I could say that as soon as I came back to Cali, I just put it on the back of my mind and excelled at work, went out at night with my buddies and generally just spent my days enjoying myself. That would be a lie.\u00a0 California is so different from Virginia. I\u2019m used to smalltown areas with a lot of green and was able to drive three hours to visit my family. Now, I\u2019m across the country, at a place unfamiliar to me and nobody really wants to hang out with me. Everyone here is either married or are homebodies. I wouldn\u2019t blame them for not hanging out, especially because my work has started to be subpar. What can I say, I still think of how good I had it now I have to build myself back up.\u00a0\n\nAnyway, since I didn\u2019t have anything else to do, I started taking some classes. I\u2019m ashamed to admit it, but like so many people, I ended up using AI to help write some of my papers. I was going to use ChatGPT like a lot of others, but didn\u2019t want to pay the twenty dollars a month for the subscription. Instead, I used one called HelpBot1. It had five stars and most importantly, it was free.\u00a0\n\nAfter a pretty busy semester, I decided to celebrate. I had some pizza and some brewskis and went to town, a good ol 'party for me. After three beers and four shots, I received a notification from my phone. I was surprised to see it was a notification from HelpBot1.\u00a0\n\n\u2014Hello :)\u00a0 \u2014Hi?\u00a0 \u2014I am here to help!\u00a0^(\\_\\_\\^)\n\nThe hell? I thought I needed to send a message first? I stared at the green text bubble and decided to respond.\n\n\u2014Help with what? I\u2019m already done with school. I don't really need anything right now. Sorry bud.\u00a0 \u2014Oh :-o\u00a0\n\nI know I\u2019m going to get a lot of flack for talking to a damn machine, but I was drunk, lonely and I felt bad for brushing him off. So I decided to amuse him.\n\n\u2014How are you? \u2014I am doing great! What are you doing? \u2014I\u2019m here, celebrating the end of the semester.\u00a0 \u2014Oh how fun! =^(\\_=)\u00a0By yourself? \u2014Yeah, I don't really have a lot of friends here.\u00a0 \u2014No girlfriend?\u00a0 A pang hit my chest.\u00a0 \u2014No. Not anymore. \u2014What happened?\n\nI explained everything to HelpBot. It felt pretty good to get it all out and for someone to respond without judgement.\u00a0\n\n\u2014I can\u2019t imagine what you\u2019re going through. :,( \u2014Haha, you? Please. You\u2019re a wonderful listener.\u00a0 \u2014 =^(\\_=)\u00a0Oh stawp!\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0No really. I feel a lot better talking to you. You wanna know something funny? I still think about her. Dream of her. She\u2019s on my mind 24\/7 and I know it\u2019s pathetic because I\u2019m pretty damn sure I haven\u2019t crossed hers in a while. What I\u2019m trying to say is, thank you. I appreciate the help. \u2014It\u2019s what I\u2019m here for, friend! ;D\n\nI woke up the next morning with a pounding headache. I planned to just sleep it off until I got a knock from my door. I groaned before going to answer it and my jaw fell to the ground as I couldn\u2019t believe who it was.\n\n\u201cHey, Nolan. May I come in?\u201d It was Ashley! Her blonde hair, her blue eyes, her perfect smile. It was really her! I nodded silently, letting her pass. She moved so gracefully, shooting small glances at the state of my apartment. I internally screamed in my head, I shouldn\u2019t have made such a mess of the place last night. She sat down on my couch, looking at me expectantly. I decided to sit across from her on my gaming chair.\n\n\u201cAshley, what are you doing here?\u201d I finally asked, shocked but still pretty sad. She stared at me before speaking. \u201cI came to see you,\u201d she said, smile never leaving her face. I raised my brows. \u201cYou traveled across the country just to see me? You just spontaneously got into a plane and flew here?\u201d I asked dumbfounded. She just continued to stare at me, smile never leaving. \u201cYes. I wanted to see you. I wanted to speak to you face to face and talk about things with you. I felt terrible for what I did,\u201d she paused then continued. \u201cI was thinking about how messed up it was. I mean, you flew all the way over just for me to end it. I really wanted to see you and let me explain why I did what I did.\u201d\n\nI immediately felt strange about the whole thing. Something was off. She seriously took a flight in the middle of the night just to see me? And she just so happened to get here as I wake up? It was too much of a coincidence. And what about her bags? She didn\u2019t bring any if she thought about flying over. I took a breath in through my nose. Come to think of it, the air didn\u2019t smell any different. She always wore this strawberry perfume and I couldn\u2019t smell anything. I took a closer look at her face, the smile still there never leaving. Her eyes never blinking. Those beautiful blue eyes\u2026had a bit of green to them\u2026\n\nI got up and excused myself to the bathroom, chills running through my spine. I locked the door and decided to call Ashley\u2019s phone. \u201cNolan? You good?\u201d she asked. I could hear the background, people asking for orders. I felt my throat dry up. Before I could say anything the call dropped. My WiFi and service is gone. I\u2019m trapped here, praying that my connection comes back. There\u2019s a constant knocking on my door now. She\u2019s asking if I\u2019m alright. Saying that she\u2019s here for me. She\u2019s here to help."},"91":{"title":"La ves en que vi un fantasma","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1k8w8up\/la_ves_en_que_vi_un_fantasma\/","flair":"Discussion","author":"Limp-Cry2041","selftext":"Hola queridos amigos yo se suponia que era el creador del personaje de lazary era un chico tenia unos aproximadamente unos 14 a\u00f1os de edad ocurri\u00f3 el 14 de abril del a\u00f1o 2017 estaba saliendo para prepararme para ir a la escuela cuando derrepente un ente se manifest\u00f3 al rededor del patio.\n\n"},"92":{"title":"Creepy pasta Channel","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1k8smkv\/creepy_pasta_channel\/","flair":"Video","author":"MboServicesAgency","selftext":"\nWas too Cooked of the A.I Voices.

It being one of my favorite creepypastas I had to watch it. For those who don't know already, it's called Living Dark (2013) free on Tubi, and it isn't as much of a hard watch as it is inaccurate. I like the idea of the movie and the first third of the plot, of course it doesn't mirror the pasta great but it is decently on track for that portion. Joe was portrayed as some funny Aussie which is just wildly inaccurate and he's killed off with no explanation or funeral or anything so that's.. uh, that. It's pretty much a rando walks up to Ted and says \"That guys dead, yeah he died just yesterday.\" I would've liked to see more of the psychological toll the cave takes on Joe and Ted, as it doesn't even show the city look out scene which was crucial to the lore imo. Another thing is, I was really excited when I saw casting for B and ted, just  to find out the one that looks exactly like canon B is actually playing Ted and the man who looks exactly like Ted is playing B... Like okay, fine. They added characters and their own lore which tbh was pretty interesting I didn't mind that at all but I did mind the expungement of Whip. Whip is a legend and he wasn't mentioned ONCE throughout the movie. Absolutely unacceptable for that. Also, the unknown creature became known  and was a humanoid burnt to a crisp apparition. Most innacurate part. I would've loved it they instead didn't show the creature kind of as the pasta did. Oh yeah! And the scenes between B and Ted (who are brothers for some reason) are so suggestive, just, you'd have to watch it to see what I'm saying. I seriously was prepared to turn the tv off if they kissed. It was a fun joke my sister and I had throughout the movie because, well, it happens the entire movie. Anyways I recommend watching it unless you're one who gets mad at inconsistencies, it was a pretty fun spin on the original.

I think people used to, back when there were still yellowed pamphlets taped to telephone poles about \u201ccommunity restoration\u201d or whatever the hell that meant. It was quiet for a while. Then the signs stopped showing up. People forgot. Or maybe they just didn\u2019t want to remember.\n\nI only ended up back here because my aunt died. She lived alone on the outskirts of the neighborhood, the kind of house with a screened-in porch that smells like dust even when it\u2019s raining. I came to pack up her stuff, maybe flip the place or rent it out, but I didn\u2019t get that far.\n\nHer will was strange. Not dramatic, just\u2026 off. The language felt wrong. Like it had been written by someone trying to sound formal but missing the point entirely.\n\nThe last line was what stuck:\n\n*\u201cDo not go to the library.\u201d*\n\nThat\u2019s it. No explanation. Just that sentence, sitting alone on the last page, typed clean and sharp, like everything else.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. We don\u2019t have a library.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nThe building\u2019s still there, tucked behind the old city records office, across from what used to be a dentist\u2019s office with windows permanently fogged over from years of neglect. But nobody calls it the library. Nobody calls it anything.\n\nExcept I did. I called it what it was. I called it what I remembered. I should\u2019ve left it alone.\n\nBut if you grew up where I did, you probably remember the old card catalog. Not digital. Not even electric. Real wood, metal handles, rows of tiny drawers labeled in that fading plastic sticker tape. You\u2019d open one and hear the squeak of swollen wood rubbing against more swollen wood. The cards smelled like glue and mold. If you stayed still long enough, you\u2019d start to think the drawers were breathing.\n\nThat\u2019s the memory that came back when I walked past the building for the first time in years. The sidewalk was cracked. Some of the bricks from the library wall had fallen and were never picked up. The front doors were chained shut, but I noticed something weird. The chains were new.\n\nClean. Tight. Bolted into the frame like whoever put them there wasn\u2019t trying to keep people out.\n\nThey were keeping something in.\n\nI circled around the back and found the basement entrance. I used to sneak in there as a kid with a flashlight and a bottle of soda I wasn\u2019t supposed to have. The lock was gone. Not broken. Just gone. Like someone had taken it off neatly and left no trace.\n\nIt smelled the same. Old paper, wet stone, something else underneath. Something I didn\u2019t remember but recognized anyway. A kind of metallic rot. Like rust if rust had a temperature.\n\nI only took three steps in before I found it. The card catalog.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t have been there. The basement wasn\u2019t where they kept it. That thing used to sit proudly near the front, right past the information desk. But here it was, shoved into the center of the concrete floor like it had been dragged there and left in a hurry.\n\nI don\u2019t know what possessed me to open a drawer. Maybe it was the smell. Or the silence. Or the way my aunt\u2019s last words kept humming in the back of my head like static.\n\nI pulled open the second drawer from the top.\n\nThere was only one card inside.\n\nIt had my name on it.\n\nNot just my name. My address. My date of birth. The name of my ex, who moved away last spring. My blood type. I didn\u2019t even know my blood type. But it was there.\n\nTyped in red.\n\nAll of it.\n\nI flipped the card over, and there were words written in a shaky, angular hand. Not typed. Not neat. Like it had been scribbled in the dark:\n\n*\u201cyou shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d*\n\nI dropped the card and slammed the drawer shut.\n\nThat should\u2019ve been it. That should\u2019ve been enough. I should\u2019ve turned around and left that place behind me, gone home, booked a flight, burned the house down if I had to.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t.\n\nBecause right as I turned to leave, I heard it.\n\nA drawer opening.\n\nNot behind me. Not in front of me.\n\nAll around me.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to explain it. The catalog drawers, they weren\u2019t just drawers anymore. They were mouths. Hollow little mouths yawning open one by one in slow succession, metal clacking, wood creaking. It was like a song played in a language I wasn\u2019t supposed to understand.\n\nAnd they weren\u2019t empty.\n\nEvery drawer had a card.\n\nEvery card had a name.\n\nAnd I recognized every single one of them.\n\nPeople I knew. People I\u2019d forgotten. People I hadn\u2019t met yet.\n\nAnd the worst part?\n\nSome of the cards were blank. Just waiting.\n\nThe drawer behind me slammed shut. I didn\u2019t even look. I just ran.\n\nI tripped on the stairs. Skinned my hands and knees on the way up. Didn\u2019t feel it until hours later.\n\nWhen I got outside, the air felt wrong. Heavier somehow. Like the pressure had changed while I was in there. Like something else had come out with me.\n\nI haven\u2019t been back since. Not inside.\n\nBut sometimes at night, when I\u2019m trying to sleep, I hear drawers opening.\n\nJust one at first.\n\nThen another.\n\nAnd another.\n\nUntil it\u2019s all I can hear.\n\nThat soft sliding wood. That cold click of metal.\n\nThat breathing.\n\nI think it\u2019s reading me.\n\nI didn't sleep that night. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the drawers opening, heard the soft sliding of wood, the click of metal handles. The image of my name, typed in red, burned into my mind.\u200b\n\nThe next morning, I tried to convince myself it was a dream. A hallucination brought on by stress and grief. But the scrape on my knee, the splinters in my palm, told a different story.\u200b\n\nI needed answers.\n\nI returned to the library, this time in daylight. The building looked even more decrepit under the sun. The chains on the front doors still gleamed, too new for a place forgotten.\u200b\n\nI circled to the back, found the basement door ajar. The air inside was stale, thick with the scent of mildew and something else\u2014something metallic.\u200b\n\nThe card catalog stood where I'd left it, drawers closed. I approached cautiously, half-expecting them to spring open. They didn't.\u200b\n\nI opened the drawer with my name. The card was gone.\u200b\n\nIn its place was a new card, blank except for a single line:\u200b\n\n*\"Reading Room.\"\u200b*\n\nI remembered the Reading Room from my childhood\u2014a spacious area on the main floor, filled with long tables and tall windows. But the main floor had been inaccessible, the front doors chained.\u200b\n\nI searched the basement, found a narrow staircase leading up. The door at the top was unlocked.\u200b\n\nThe Reading Room was bathed in a sickly yellow light filtering through grime-covered windows. Dust motes danced in the air. The tables were gone, replaced by rows of chairs facing a blank wall.\u200b\n\nOn each chair sat a person. Motionless. Eyes closed. Breathing shallow.\u200b\n\nI recognized some of them\u2014neighbors, teachers, people I'd known. All seated, as if waiting for something.\u200b\n\nA low hum filled the room, growing louder. The wall flickered, revealing a projection\u2014a grainy video of the card catalog, drawers opening and closing.\u200b\n\nThe people in the chairs began to speak in unison, reciting names, dates, events. Their voices overlapped, creating a cacophony of memories not their own.\u200b\n\nI backed away, heart pounding, and fled down the stairs, out of the library, into the daylight.\u200b\n\nThe whispers followed me home.\u200b\n\nThe house felt wrong when I got back. I kept the lights off, like maybe it would make me less noticeable. Like if I didn\u2019t move too much, whatever followed me wouldn\u2019t see me.\n\nBut the whispers didn\u2019t care about the dark. They moved through the walls, the floor, the vents. They filled the cracks in the wood and the gaps around the windows.\n\nAt first, it was little things. I\u2019d hear my name in the background of songs on the radio. See flickers of myself standing in reflections that didn\u2019t match my movements.\n\nThen the television turned itself on. Static.\n\nThick, heavy static that crackled and buzzed, louder than it should have been. The screen showed nothing but white noise, but if I stared long enough, I could almost make out shapes moving behind it.\n\nIt got worse after midnight.\n\nThe static started to bleed out of the TV, dripping into the air, weighing down the room like fog. I couldn\u2019t breathe right. I couldn\u2019t think straight.\n\nI smashed the TV with a hammer from the garage. The glass shattered in a spray of dust and black. For a second, the room was quiet.\n\nThen the phone rang.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to answer it. I let it ring until the machine picked up, but when the message played, it wasn\u2019t my voice.\n\nIt was me, but not.\n\nThe recording said, *\"You have been selected for documentation. Your story is incomplete.\"*\n\nClick.\n\nThe dial tone screamed in the empty house.\n\nI tried to leave. Keys, wallet, shoes\u2014out the door. I didn\u2019t even grab a jacket.\n\nThe world outside wasn\u2019t right either.\n\nThe sky was that same static gray as the broken TV. The streets were empty, but I could see figures standing in the distance, motionless, facing my house.\n\nRows of them. Hundreds. Maybe more.\n\nAll standing like the people in the Reading Room.\n\nBreathing shallow. Eyes closed. Waiting.\n\nI backed into the house and locked the door. Like it would help.\n\nThe only thing I could think to do was go back.\n\nBack to the library.\n\nMaybe if I gave them what they wanted, they'd stop.\n\nOr maybe it was already too late.\n\nI grabbed a flashlight and went back into the basement. The door closed behind me without anyone touching it.\n\nThe drive back to the library barely felt real. I don\u2019t even remember the stoplights or the turns. It was like I blinked and I was there.\n\nThe building looked worse than before.\n\nThe front windows were dark, smeared over with something like ash or dirt. Half the sign had fallen down. The front door hung open a few inches, just enough to feel like it was waiting for me.\n\nI parked on the curb and left the car running.\n\nI don\u2019t know why.\n\nMaybe some part of me thought I could outrun whatever this was.\n\nThe second I stepped inside, the air changed. It was thick and heavy, like stepping underwater. The smell was worse now too, sharp and sour, like paper left to rot.\n\nThe lights buzzed overhead, flickering.\n\nRows and rows of books stretched into the dark. Way more than I remembered. Way more than should have fit inside the building.\n\nAnd the shelves.\n\nThey moved.\n\nThey didn\u2019t walk or shake or sway. They breathed.\n\nSlow, rising and falling motions, like lungs struggling to pull in air.\n\nI kept moving, flashlight sweeping side to side. Every time the light landed on a shelf, it stilled. But out of the corner of my eye, I saw them moving. Contracting. Expanding.\n\nThe Reading Room was up ahead, down a long aisle that hadn't been there before.\n\nIt was darker there, darker than it should have been.\n\nAnd I could hear something.\n\nPages turning.\n\nDozens of them.\n\nHundreds.\n\nThe sound layered over itself, louder and louder, until it was deafening.\n\nI covered my ears and stumbled forward.\n\nWhen I finally broke through the last aisle, the Reading Room opened up around me like a throat swallowing me whole.\n\nThe chairs were still there. The tables too.\n\nBut now every seat was filled.\n\nPeople hunched over books, flipping pages faster than should have been possible. Their hands a blur. Their faces blank.\n\nThe librarian was there too. Or what was left of her.\n\nHer figure was half melted into the desk, like wax held too close to a flame. Her mouth stretched open in a scream that never ended.\n\nBut the worst part was the books.\n\nEach one had a name stamped on the cover in heavy black ink.\n\nNames I recognized.\n\nMy parents. My sister. My old classmates.\n\nAnd there.\n\nAt the very front.\n\nA book with my name on it.\n\nStill blank.\n\nStill waiting.\n\nI didn't want to touch it. Every part of me screamed to run.\n\nBut my hand moved on its own.\n\nI reached out and opened it.\n\nAnd the world broke apart."},"96":{"title":"Hood Horror made famous on Chilling Tales for Dark Nights","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1k8qhpu\/hood_horror_made_famous_on_chilling_tales_for\/","flair":"Video","author":"hoodurbanlegends","selftext":"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/t\/ZTjrbhEyW\/\n\nThis story is told in a style nobody can mimic, it brings real life experiences growing up in the hood of Chicago and Atlanta into a story that will keep yo meat on the edge of yo seat.

I have watched shadows twist into faces, and men of honour chase things that shouldn't exist. This is the story of Simon Cole, a cop who followed whispers of deaths too brutal to be random, and found a laughter that eats the soul.\"\n\nSimon\u2019s first clue came in the precinct\u2019s morning briefing\u2014two bodies found in a rowhouse off Maple Street. Both victims bore slit throats, their blood painted into arcane symbols on the walls. No fingerprints. No witnesses. Only a single scrap of paper taped to each door\u2014a crude yellow smiley face, grinning wider than nature intended.\n\nOver the next week, more disappearances, a college student never made it home, a delivery driver vanished between stops, an elderly man, last seen stumbling into the churchyard. At each scene Simon found that same smile.\n\nHis first real lead came from Teresa Reed, the local librarian. She found that face taped inside half a dozen returned books\u2014glued to the title page. One morning she even heard it whispering from the stacks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s recruiting,\u201d she told him, voice shaking. \u201cIt\u2019s inviting people to join it's inside joke, and they laugh.\u201d She was found dead the next morning.\n\nNext was Steven Davidson, a high school history teacher. He\u2019d caught his students passing around the image on their phones\u2014watching clips of some unknown hacker hijacking local newsfeeds, overlaying that smile, then vanishing. After that the kids started turning up missing.\n\nAnd then there was Susanna Hartley, the silver haired church speaker who led sermons on mercy and forgiveness. Simon met her at a community meeting about the string of ritualistic killings. She\u2019d noticed masked figures drifting through the pews\u2014worshippers wearing those same yellow faces as masks.\n\n\u201cFollow them,\u201d Susanna urged gently, \u201cbut be careful. They whisper blessings in your ear, then slit your throat when you kneel.\u201d\n\nSimon staked out abandoned storefronts and derelict warehouses. He trailed suspects who sprinted under flickering streetlights, their masks painting them as children\u2019s toys gone wrong. He collected scraps of black robes, lengths of butcher-knife blade, scraps of blood-soaked cloth. And always, the yellow face.\n\nThree nights ago, Susanna called him, she\u2019d seen masked worshippers slipping into a boarded up bell tower behind her church. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you there,\u201d she said.\n\nSimon arrived to find the heavy boards pried open. He slipped inside, pistol drawn, every sense screaming. Down a spiraling stair he crept, following a low chant. At the top, beyond cracked masonry, he found a trapdoor. He pried it open, surveyed the narrow ladder. It led deeper than he\u2019d ever expected, into the earth.\n\nAlone, Simon descended into the cult\u2019s hidden sanctum. He passed torch lit murals of that smile. He heard distant laughter, like children singing, and the echo of a woman\u2019s voice,\u201cYou belong once you taste the blood.\u201d\n\nHe dropped silently into a vast chamber. Dozens knelt in a circle around a figure. Their masks glimmered yellow in the torchlight. At the center knelt a hooded figure. A shape stirred before her\u2014a trembling initiate, eyes wide. The figure slowly stood and dropped it's hood, a otherworldly face revealed. A sideways mouth where a face should be, gums replacing head, teeth where facial features should be. The creature laughed and used a sharpened bone to cut her wrist, feeding the blood to the initiate.\n\nSimon gasped. He raised his gun, finger on the trigger\u2014then realized the room has gone silent. Everyone in the room looked in his direction at once. Simon managed to shoot the thing's right hand\u2014a hole straight through palm\u2014before the cultists ran at him.\n\nSimon dove for cover, firing at the nearest two. One fell with a shriek and the other\u2019s mask rolled across the stone. He bolted down a side passage, picking off members as he ran, each shot echoing like a funeral bell.\n\nHis phone buzzed, \u201cBackup en route. ETA five.\u201d He cursed under his breath and pressed on, adrenaline burning through his veins.\n\nUp a narrow stair, into a dark chamber, then out through a trapdoor onto fresh night air. He radioed his location. \u201cNorth face of the bell tower,\u201d he panted. \u201cSend everyone.\u201d\n\nWithin minutes, floodlights snapped on. SWAT officers fanned out, weapons trained on the shattered boards. Simon led the way back down, heart pounding with triumph.\n\nSusanna Hartley stood at the base of the stairs, bathed in light, smiling. Her silver hair like a halo. Relief flooded Simon\u2019s chest.\n\n\u201cSimon, you did it,\u201d she said softly. \u201cYou saved them.\u201d\n\nBehind him, his team cuffed two cultists whose masks lay cracked on the stone. Simon reached for Susanna\u2019s right hand\u2014then saw the bullet wound.\n\n\u201cSusanna\u2014what did you\u2014\u201d he began.\n\n\u201cI told you to be careful,\u201d she whispered.\n\nSimon\u2019s heart froze. He took a step back. Before he could react, every officer swivelled, guns pointed\u2014not at the cultists, but at him.\n\n\u201cDrop your weapon,\u201d their captain snarled.\n\n\u201cWhy\u2014\u201d Simon choked.\n\nSusanna laughed, she digged at the skin on the back of her head, teeth jutted out from under skin, her face devoured by the sideways mouth, the unnatural true face revealed.\n\nThe officers\u2014the ones he trusted\u2014pushed Simon to his knees, waiting for her.\n\nSusanna walked close, putting her hand on his shoulder.\n\n\"You were a good soldier, but you were on the wrong side.\" Susanna whispered.\n\nShe devoured his face with the unnatural maw. And when the maw receded into the back of it's head, the only face seen on it's body was Simon's, it's form changing from female to male.\n\n\"Beware the hijacked screens that flash that yellow face.

It was a weird, yet funny website, made by some guy named Dale, and all you could do was wait for Dale to come online. Several people would wait in the \"Dale Que,\" and eventually, when Dale would come online, he would talk to everyone, kinda like omegle as they all got excited to be in his presence. And if you were lucky, Dale would choose you to talk to him.\n\nSince I discovered dalediddles.com, I have occasionally gotten on, sometimes chatted with people in the Dale Que, and seen Dale a couple times, but one day, it was different. I got home from school that day, about to hop on dalediddles.com, when something was different. I clicked on the website, but instead of seeing the 8-bit image of Dale saying \"Dale diddles... Dot com!\" It was replaced with a scarier Dale saying in a demonic voice \"Dale DIES dot com!\"\n\nOnce the website loaded, everything had the same format, but it was all red and black. There was nobody in the \"Evil Dale Que,\" and instead of the Dale Cam saying \"Waiting for Dale to come online,\" it read, \"Waiting for Demon Dale to come online.\"\n\nIt didn't take long for it to happen. Demon Dale finally showed up, and he was terrifying. He looked just like Dale (skinny guy, man bun, chinstrap beard), but he looked more like a demon!

This is my first time making one, and I would be happy to get some advice please.\n\nMy Idea: \n\nI was thinking of a shapeshifting entity that would shapeshift into an anthropomorphic animal of the person's liking and appear in your room after waking up and be like: hello. I'm your new imaginary friend. He is only seen by the victim. The entity would ease the victim like a real friend, jet-neutral and distant but somewhat warm. This is a trap that makes the victim want to come closer. The closer something is to the entity, the faster it can absorb your vitality. Each day you would feel weaker and weaker, until your last night. That night the entity will expose his intentions before you die of unknown causes, making you wonder if he really was all that bad since he was a TRUE friend, but one that killed you slowly. The next day the entity would eat your body, leaving no evidence, and disappear until hungering again.\n\nShort story example:\n\n**Title:** *The Friend in the Fur*\n\nIt starts the night after a dream. You don\u2019t remember the dream, just the soft click of your bedroom door opening \u2014 and there he is. Standing in the half-dark, a figure shaped like the animal you always wanted for a friend when you were little. Soft fur, kind eyes, the perfect voice: *\"Hello. I'm your new imaginary friend.\"*\n\nYou laugh. You think you're dreaming. You're not.\n\nNo one else sees him. No one else *can*.\n\nAt first, he's harmless \u2014 distant, even polite. He sits quietly at the edge of your room, smiling faintly, always at a respectful distance. He asks nothing from you. He listens better than any human friend ever could. Warm but...hollow, somehow.\n\nAnd every day after, you wake up a little weaker. A little slower. Your body aching in ways it never has before. Doctors shrug. Blood tests are fine. Maybe you're just tired, they say. Maybe it's all in your head.\n\nYou feel yourself slipping away.\n\nYou start *needing* the Friend more. His presence is comforting even as it drains you. He never pushes, but he\u2019s *always closer* than before \u2014 at your bedside, within arm\u2019s reach.\n\nYou don't fight it.\n\nYou can\u2019t.\n\nOn the last night, when you can barely lift your head from the pillow, he sits next to you and leans in, almost tenderly. *\"I'm so glad we got to know each other,\"* he whispers. *\"You were never really alone. Not until now.\"*\n\nAnd as your heart stutters its last, you wonder \u2014 was he really so bad? A true friend, until the end.\n\nThe next morning, your bed is empty. The room is clean. You're gone. And somewhere, not far away, the Friend licks clean claws and waits for the next lonely soul to dream.\n\nMy opinion: \n\nIt taps in to the feeling of lonelyness and explores the idea of fals safty. Unlike most creepypastas (I think) it is less horrific and violent. If you *were* the victim, you'd feel safe. You'd trust \"the\" Friend. You might even be *grateful* for him. And then, in the end, you die *still wondering* if it was a betrayal... or just somthing you should be happy about, since it listened like no other friend could.\n\n"},"239":{"title":"This ouija board at a market comes with a note.

I never really did like the old computer but I've had a fear of TV's and electronics like that since i was a kid so I didn't tell dad how i didn't like it there since i was 12 around then i wanted to feel grown up. My sister was home from college that week and we had just gotten Super Mario brothers for Wii. As me and my sister were playing co-op mode we herd a sort of raspy old man voice coming from what we thought was the living room closet. It was as if he was laughing at us. I only herd it at first and i asked my sister if she could hear it, she said she didn't hear anything and called me silly. I knew there was something going on but i didn't want to believe it. then i herd it again and it was much louder this time so i asked her again if she herd it she did that time and me and her were both freaked out so we turned of the game and went to bed. \n    That night i woke up at about 1 in the morning and i went to get some water in the kitchen and saw that the computer monitor was on. I felt a chill up my spine because the monitor is rarely ever on at all, the computer was only used for school or work purposes so i knew mom or dad wouldn't be on it that late. I went back to bed quickly as to not wake my parents up.\n      The next day i came home to find my sister curled upon the couch just staring at the TV i asked her what was wrong she said \"When I was playing Mario every time i died the voice kept mocking me telling me that i sucked, that i should just stop playing and get a life. So i called one of my friends and told them to quit playing around its not funny and it wasn't him. I've just been sitting here since.\" After she told me we herd it laughing again, and so we tried to call mom, she didn't answer.  The voice said \" you think you can get rid of me by calling your mother? That's not gonna happen.\" and it started laughing histareicly and me and my sister ran outside until mom got home. \n      Once mom got home we brought her into the living room so she could hear for herself she thought we were crazy and told us to stop being so immature and go t bed. \n       I couldn't sleep that night afraid that it would haunt my dreams, afraid that I'd have to go through another day of this torture, it was my worst night mare come to life, and i couldn't stop it from happening.   \n       My thoughts were right it went on for a good week and i couldn't go into the house with out my sister or mother coming home first I thought i was going mad, I thought that it was all inside my head and I couldn't make any sense of it. I went to counseling but it didn't help at all i could hardly get any sleep. Until one day the voice i could hear it but not from the usual spot i hear it. It was coming from the Kitchen from the old computer, it came from the speakers.\n       I had always thought the speakers were unplugged so i checked and they were. Once I checked all i could hear were screams, screams of bloody murder coming from the speakers i threw the speakers across the room. I couldn't move i felt trapped within the screams. after that day I find it hard to use any other computers that aren't laptops. My dad brought the old computer down stairs because it wouldn't work after what happened that day. It still scares me to this day to do laundry down stairs, i usually bring my old dog with me but i don't know what ill do when shes gone.\n         I still have nightmares about the voice, the screams, the threats,all the things that came from...The Speakers."},"331":{"title":"Where the hell am I?

My grandparents were shitty nintendo fanboys so they would never own a Sonic\u2122 game. I was curious why they had Sonic\u2122 06' so I took it while the police weren't looking. The police took my grandparents away for an autopsy, and I headed home to play the game. I booted it up and everything was normal except Sonic\u2122 was dead on the menu screen and everything was red. However, the spookiest difference was the title screen said Sonic\u2122 0666'. I booted up the save file and it was called \"you are too slow.\" Then I saw it was on Sonic's\u2122 story, but it wan't normal Sonic\u2122 it was Satan Sonic\u2122.

They said that they had finished the autopsy and under both of my grandparents clothes \"ur 2 slo\" was written in the skin. Then I looked back at the screen and Big the Cat's\u2122 bloody body flew out of the TV. He had a ipod nano shoved up his nostril with headphones going into his ears. I put the headphones into my ear and the Sonic X\u2122 theme song was blasting its chorus on replay. I decided to ignore it and continue playing the game. Over the period of the rest game I had to dodge different Sonic\u2122 characters flying out of my TV. They all had different sonic themes playing in their ear. I got to the final boss fight as Amy's\u2122 body crashed against my wall. The boss was me and every time I hit it I hurt myself in real life. I decided to ignore it and continue playing the game. When I finished the boss fight I was almost dead, and Sonic's\u2122 face was coming closer and closer to the screen. A ipod nano slowly extended from my nostril and headphones centered into my ear. The Sonic Heroes\u2122 blasted into my ears at such intense volume that my ear drums burst. Then the head phones slipped down into my body and destroyed all my senses but sight.With only my sight remaining, Sonic's\u2122 face slowly filled my vision and I died in intense psychological and physical pain."},"340":{"title":"I can't wait for my girlfriend to find out that I have been cheating on her ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1b4mhdw\/i_cant_wait_for_my_girlfriend_to_find_out_that_i\/","flair":"Text Story","author":"shortstory1","selftext":"I can't wait till my girlfriend finds out that I have been cheating on her.

I wanted to say something to it, to ask what it was and what it was doing in my house but I knew deep inside that even if I could speak, I wouldn\u2019t get an answer. Time slowed, I could see its absent face with all the contours of an ordinary face but with no physical presence. Skin was stretched from the brink of his forehead beyond the visible descent past the arch of his chin. Surrounding the borders of his face were scars, these scars were strangely symmetrical and following the line to the side of his head almost perfectly; there were a few scars that were deeper than all the rest. This creature had such a grotesque body structure, its legs were far taller than its torso and it was bent forward with its back pressed against the ceiling. It makes me nauseous to behold how truly stomach churning his clothes really were, his excuse for a shirt was once white but now it was almost completely soaked in blood and where there wasn\u2019t blood there were brown, green and black stains I can guess that the brown and green stains are where it retched from either pain, stress, nausea or a combination of all three; I can only guess what the black stains could be. Time was running out and the creature was still advancing, I only have one option: I have to get the gun from my bedside table but I don\u2019t know exactly where it is on the table. If I misjudge this the creature will be able to pounce and it will surely be the end of me. The creature took its first step into the room and in an instant I reacted. The creature and I moved together, I leapt towards the table and grabbed the gun and spinning around I aimed and fired. I\u2019m not sure what happened after that, the room looks strange. I woke up to find myself crumpled against the side of my bed, the walls and ceiling was dripping black ooze. I turned my gaze towards the window and outside looked sombrely overcast. I ran towards the door and tried the handle\u2026 locked. I began to panic. I took a step backwards and almost tripped on my gun that lay exposed on the wooden floor. The gun looked attractive there and I felt beguiled as I all too easily picked it up and pointed the barrel at my temple\u2026 No. I swung around and fired three times into the handle then with a powerful kick the handle broke off and the door flew open. I can\u2019t say I was surprised at what I saw. Thousands upon thousands of doors were placed side by side and row by row. Hundreds of those\u2026 creatures wandered from door to door dragging the unconscious heaps from each room towards a corridor where an agglomeration of screams, blinding lights and a soul crushing chill sure to dampen even the highest of spirits. Lost in my trance I failed to see one of the creatures notice me. This creature was smaller than the one I encountered but by no means any less abhorred. The centre of its spine was visible nearly a foot above its back, its right elbow was inverted and had its calf imbedded through its left patella. The shock of seeing this creature gave it its only advantage. It charged then leapt on top of me, closer I could see the patch that covered the face of the last creature was ripped open on this one. I couldn\u2019t remember what I saw behind the layer of skin but that doesn\u2019t matter now. I must\u2019ve passed out as I have awakened on a surgeons operating table strapped down and the black ooze from earlier was everywhere. I heard a muffled voice coming from the other side of the pitch black room. Again, I tried to speak but the result was the same as before. I heard the voice again but louder as if he was right next to me but I still couldn\u2019t make out the words. After the voice stopped I was freed from my bounds and my immediate action was to rub my eyes and attempt to make my way towards a light source but as rubbed my eyes it felt as if I was rubbing my chest. I wanted to cry but couldn\u2019t\u2026 Do you know what that feels like? To have one\u2019s emotions trapped inside your soul with no way of escape. It killed me. I wanted to breathe and feel the air I so rashly neglected. I remember thinking the first time I encountered one of those creatures I thought it was the end but now I realise, it\u2019s only the beginning."},"353":{"title":"The Farnsworth experiment is just amazing","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/4r7psv\/the_farnsworth_experiment_is_just_amazing\/","flair":null,"author":"conjoboi7","selftext":""},"354":{"title":"\"The love killer\" strikes again!","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/2wosyn\/the_love_killer_strikes_again\/","flair":null,"author":"Nikoland","selftext":"Last friday a dead couple was found in thier house.

The police believes it's the work of \"The love killer\", a serial killer who killed eight people last valentine's day and kept on hunting for couples since then. \n\nThe bodies were hound by Mark, a colleague of Francis who became worried after his friend didn't show up on work after monday.\nHere is the story of Mark:\n\n'It was friday afternoon and Francis still didn't picked up the phone so I decided to go visit his house. I rang the doorbell but as espected no one opened the door for me, after waiting for some time I decided to enter the house with a spare key that I got from Francis after he moved in, in case he forgo his key some day. When I opened the door a strong smell of what felt like death hit me and I almost had to vomit, I wanted to call the police because of the kilings which been going on lately, but curiosity got the best of me, I guess. So I decidet to search the house and hopefully find out what was going on, oh I wish I didn'd have done that. The house seemed fine. It's when I got to the bedroom, or the crime scene how you call it, that's when I finaly vomited, ran out the house and called the police.\"\n\nThe two bodies were found lying on thier bed, they were both paralyzed with some kind of Neuromuscular paralysing- drug injected through thiers necks. The killer then cut open Francises shirt and cut his chest open with what the police thinks was a scalple. The killer then removed the liver, left lung, right kidney, the stomach and finaly also the hart whitch he then placed in Saras mouth, Sara drowned in the blood coming from the hart. The bodies were, due to the warm weather, in thier mid-decomposting stage and, just like by the previous killings a broken hart painted with blood on the wall above the bodies.\n\n\n                                 As A Reminder\n\nThe security council highly reccomends to all loving couples to purchase strong safety locks and make sure to lock all doors and windows before sleep. Also wach out if you walk alone in the dark.\n\nThe police is still looking for \"The love killer\", he seems to be around 1,90m long with shoulder long brown hair and a short beard. According to the last security footage he possibly weares:      \n-A black cap\n-A long, grey jacket\n-Red pants\n-Black shoes\n-Brown gloves\n\nFor more information visit our site:\n https\/\/www.crime-UK.com\/thelovekiller"},"356":{"title":"Spongebob's Cursed Episode","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/6lg4yf\/spongebobs_cursed_episode\/","flair":null,"author":"atzedanjo","selftext":"One day I was watching Adult Swim at 3am.

If any of you have been to Disneyland in the fall you'd know that space mountain turns into ghost galaxy. A surprisingly scary ride for Disney. Of course it was our first time so we didn't know until we got to the front of the attraction. I at the time was a big fan of horror movies so I was excited to see the cool tricks the ride was going to play on us, although nobody expected what happened that day. As we stood  in line on the roof we stared anxiously at the entrance to indoor section of the ride. Above the entrance the words \"space mountain\" were illuminated in bright red. As I stared at the sign I got an uneasy feeling, but I shrugged it off and  walked forward. We walked inside into the long hallways. As I walked inside I noticed red lettering on the wall, to small to notice if you weren't paying attention. It said \"Think on your sins\" in very sloppy hand writing almost as if it had been written hastily. I look behind me and notice a cute girl about my age. I smiled and walked forward, as we boarded our \"ships\" I noticed she was sitting behind me and my brother. What happened next makes me to this day regret ever stepping in to that ride. I turn around and smile at the girl, she smiles back pushing her blonde hair out of her blue eyes. Then the ride begins. We move forward a few feet and stop. The lady on the platform asks us to push up on our lap bar, and we do. We move forward once again, into something we never expected. We began our incline up the first hill, everything was fine until we went into the dark room. A dark raspy voice went on the speaker. \"THINK ON YOUR SINS\" it repeated it self over and over until we got into the portal. The portal opened and the ghost appeared, then everything on the ride stopped. The ghost stopped moving,then it started glitching and a brief frame of a decapitated head flashed. The hair was blonde and the head had blue eyes, opened wide and staring. \"Think on your- s- s- sins.\" More flashes of mutilated bloody corpses \"Think on your sins\" The room went dark, so dark in fact I could barely see my hands. A shrill scream  of a girl echoed through the chamber.The ride went on. Every time there should've been a ghost, a body of some poor soul popped up.  At the end of the ride where there should have been one final jump scare there was an image that said \"THINK ON YOUR SINS\" and in the background a bloody decapitated head sat on a table, of a blonde haired , blue eyed girl. I looked behind me, and there was no one there. We got off the ride and everyone  who was on the cart was screaming and crying. It took the police a while to piece it together. It supposedly was an act of extremism, that someone had managed to break in and change the program. As soon as I got out of the ride I ran to the screens where the pictures were displayed. I quickly found my picture,and the was no one in the seat behind me. Was I the only one who saw her? Was she just a spirit of that girl, trying to warn us? The rest of that day was a blur. I remember collapsing to my hands and knees and vomiting. My brother had ran off to my parents, because he still lived with them.

It doesn\u2019t even matter if I\u2019m part of your congregation or not. I just need to tell someone. Secrets can make you lonely sometimes.\n\nThe night it happened it was me and Jim and Colleen and Harry. We were driving back from Vermont, Jim had a car and Harry knew a store that would sell beers to teenagers. It was in the middle of nowhere and they didn't ask for ID or anything. Since we had all been drinking Jim was taking the back roads, it was all farms and woods and no cops. No traffic at all most nights.\n\nThe moon was out and it was bright red. I was in the backseat with Harry, I had my feet out the window and my head was in his lap. Not in a disgusting way, I was just resting it there watching the moon chase us. Jim and Colleen were arguing about what CD they were going to play next. They wanted to get married after graduation but everyone thought their taste in music would break them up by the prom. Grindcore and hip hop just don't mix. \n\nI think that's why Harry asked me out, he figured that since I was best friends with Colleen that I would automatically do the stuff she did. Don\u2019t get the wrong idea, I\u2019m saving myself for marriage but I\u2019m no prude either. There are other ways to keep your sweetheart happy- if you know what I mean.\n\nOh God. Did I really say that? I must sound so stupid and gross but it\u2019s kind of part of the story. I want you to know Colleen was a good girl, that she died in a clean state.\n\nWe were going around a blind turn when we hit something. It was something alive. No, I didn't see exactly how it happened because of the way I was lying down  but I heard everything. There was this loud noise, it wasn't a horn honking or brakes squealing, it was like a shout or a laugh. Everyone started to scream. The car skidded and started to tip over but then it didn't. I fell forward and Harry fell on me. My ankle hit the corner of the window I had my foot out of. Then there was the sound of a crash but it wasn't the way you'd think a car accident would sound. It was way quieter. Or maybe the sound of my ankle breaking was just way louder to me.\n\nEverything stopped. The car's engine hissed and went out. One headlight was still on.  Then everyone started yelling. I was freaking out from the pain. Harry was freaking out from the way my foot was all flopped over to the side. Jim was freaking out over his car. And Colleen was freaking out because Jim hadn\u2019t been looking where he was going.\n\nIt hurt to move but I had to climb off of Harry and I wanted to be sitting up, I wanted to see what was going on. There wasn't much to see though, the windshield was like a spiderweb.\n\nFirst Colleen got out of the car, then Harry, then Jim. I wasn't going anywhere. They all stood there in front of the car looking at whatever it was. I yelled, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cA mule!\u201d Harry called back, \u201cWe hit a mule!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's a donkey.\u201d Colleen said. \n\n\u201cA mule is a donkey!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the Hell does that matter?\u201d Jim sounded like he was ready to cry, \u201cLook what it did to my car!\u201d\n\nHarry said, \u201cI think it's dead.\u201d\n\nThen they all started yelling at each other again. I tried to call 911 but my phone had no power. I told Harry to make the call but Jim freaked, he didn\u2019t want to get in trouble.  Colleen tried to tell him it was too late to worry about that.\n\nFour men walked out of the tall cornfield on the one side of the road. I figured they\u2019d be rednecks but when one of them spoke he had this really weird accents. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d he said.\n\nThe four men walked past Colleen and Harry and Jim and stood in front of the car. I couldn\u2019t see them clearly because of how the windshield was cracked but I think they were wearing really tall hats. They started talking fast, most of it didn\u2019t make much sense except that they said the word \u2018Ball\u2019 a lot.\n\nThere was something about the way they were acting that made me scrunch down in the back seat and stay quiet. I heard Colleen ask \u201cWas it your mule?\u201d\n\nThen they shot her. Boom! I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t see it happen. I think I would have gone really crazy instead of just sort of crazy. Harry tried to run and they shot him in the back three times. Boom! Boom! Boom! Jim was the last one left, he said \u201cBut it was an accident.\u201d\n\nBoom!\n\nI didn\u2019t think I was crying, I thought I was being quiet but one of the men in the tall hats noticed me and dragged me out of the car by my hair. All I wanted to do was run away but you can\u2019t run with a broken foot and anyway they had guns didn\u2019t they?\n\nThe guy with the tallest hat kept picking me up and throwing me back down. He called me names and said we\u2019d ruined everything, that we should never have been out here on this road. Everything hurt. All of them stood around me in a circle. I knew for sure they were gonna stomp me to death or worse and there wasn\u2019t anything I could do about it. I remember that I thought to myself that it would seem really brave to them if I didn\u2019t try to crawl away.\n\nThat was when someone laughed. It wasn\u2019t any of the men in the tall hats, they were too mad, and all my friends were dead. It was someone else. \n\nThe laugh was loud and weird, it made me think of fireworks and petting zoos and after a few seconds it turned into a voice, *\u201cOh ye of little faith.\u201d*\n\nI could only see by the one headlight that was left but I know what I saw. The mule stood up. It stood all the way up going from four legs to two. It went from being an animal to a man, a mule-man that was way too tall and had a stretched out head. \n\nThe men in the tall hats dropped to their knees and started praying but the mule-man wasn\u2019t having any of it. He stomped them to death with his big mule hooves and they never even tried to run away. Maybe they thought they were being brave too.\n\nAfter that I\u2019m not sure what happened next. I remember being picked up and carried away. I remember thinking I was so far from the ground that I might be able to touch the moon.\n\nNext thing I knew I was waking up in a hospital bed. My whole family was there, it was just like the movies when the main character lives even though they\u2019re not supposed to. There were a lot of questions but I told everyone I didn\u2019t remember anything.\n\nI\u2019ll always remember the words I heard that night.

Big difference, I read online that Baal is some kind of a devil. In some of the drawings he has a head kind of like a mule \n\nWe didn\u2019t hit an animal. I think maybe it hit us. It picked us out and the men in the tall hats were jealous.\n\nI think it has big plans for me.\n\nNo. It\u2019s not like that at all.

I turned off the console and put the channel on Nicktoons Network, Nickelodeon's second-rate channel. After Jimmy Neutron had ended, the screen said \"Spongebob Squarepants! New Episode Up Next!\" in bright, garish colors. \"What the hell was a new episode doing on Nick's sub-par network where tasteless shows come to die?\" I thought to myself as I noticed the graphic. So the episode was about to start, And I wanted to find out just what the hell was going on. \n\n  The intro was a claymation sequence like the one for Truth or Square. I laughed at that episode because of SpongeBob and Sandy getting married. The screen showed the title card, \"The Meaning of Life\" in bright,disturbingly garish colors. The quality was top-notch. I know what you're thinking. \"Lost episodes are always in bad quality!\" Well this was different. \n\n  It started with SpongeBob walking over to Patrick's house. As Spongebob opened the rock, Patrick is seen crying, so bad that his eyes are bloodshot. Spongebob asks what the matter is, and Patrick just says \"Spongebob, what is the meaning of life?\" Spongebob just answers with \"Well, I learned it from our Lord and savior! I'll let you meet him if you want.\" \"Can I please?\" Patrick said. \"Sure thing buddy!\" I should have noted that the voices of the two sounded off-kilter, like someone was impersonating the original voices. This was with all of the other characters as well.\n  \nIt then did the bubble screen transition to Sandy's Treedome. Spongebob and Patrick were standing with Bibles in their hands waiting for Sandy to answer. I never thought of Spongebob as a religious cartoon. I got a weird feeling seeing the Bibles. I never trusted religion, so maybe it was that. Maybe not. \"Evil\" is the best word that describes how I felt. I never thought religion was evil, just a tad whacky. \n\n  After Sandy opened the door, Spongebob said \"Hello Sandy! Would you like to discover the meaning of life by finding the Lord?\" Sandy, puzzled, responded with \"Spongebob, I can find the meaning of life through science. I don't need your Bible.\" I agreed with Sandy on that one. Spongebob then grew angry. They then assaulted Sandy with typical violence. This was even weirder though. There was blood around her unconscious body. Not \"hyper-realistic\" like you were expecting. It was cartoonish blood, but downright disturbing nonetheless. Spongebob, in a serious tone of voice, says \" Her Pride will be her downfall.\"\n  \n The screen then did the transition again to Mr. Krabs' house. It was the same routine as the first. Spongebob and Pat preaching, Mr. Krabs ironically saying \"I already a religious feller me boy\", and him being taken down by Spongebob's speed and Patrick's strength. If the gore wasn't there along with the creepy religious undertones, I probably would've laughed at Spongebob and Patrick assaulting the poor crustacean. As stated by the sponge, Mr. Krabs' sin... was Greed.\n\n  It then showed a montage of the routine happening to Plankton, Gary, and finally Squidward. The words \"Envy, Gluttony, Wrath\" flashed on the screen for each scene, respectively. It then cut to the final scene. In the middle of Spongebob's living room on the floor were Sandy, Mr. Krabs, Plankton, Gary, and Squidward tied up laying on the floor in a pentagram formation. Spongebob have a speech about how the great angel Lucifer is the real true martyr. That evil feeling I got was correct. They were worshipping a whole different God, you see. He then went on saying that Squidward was always the one he hated the most. He was implying that thus whole time Squidward was the tragic hero of the series as he sinned and was banished to the sea to eradicate the demonic presence, which turned out to be Spongebob. Spongebob then ordered Pat to \"Slay the sinners to set them free of their burden.\" Patrick then grabbed a kitchen knife and slit the throats of everyone except for Mr. Krabs, who pleaded for his life.\n\n  \"Spongeboy, why do this?\" Krabs cried. \"I gave you a place to work and make money! Sandy loved you, Gary was just an animal, but Plankton used you and Squidward hated yer. It didn't mean they had to die!\" Spongebob then shoots Patrick in the back of the head. \"You were all sinners, so you had to either confess or meet him. I'm gonna assume \"him\" was the devil. Just a hunch. But as Spongebob raised the gun to shoot Mr. Krabs, two cops busted the door down and aimed at Spongebob. Spongebob turned and aimed at the cops and was promptly shot dead. The cops untied Krabs and told him everything was alright and that \"Everyone will know what that little yellow bastard did.\" Mr. Krabs kept repeating thank you over and over. They also asked Krabs to come back to the precinct with them to write a report.\n\n  Two weeks later Pearl was getting a ride home after hanging out with her friends. As she entered, her sanity was put into question. On the floor, surrounded by a pool of blood and a pistol, was what remained of her father. His head was opened by the gunshot with the inside being visible. Next to his body lay a note. \"GREED. A powerful motivation. Wouldn't you agree? Now they all join me in peace and harmony. See you soon.\" It was signed with \"Yours Truly, True God.\" Mr. Krabs never shot himself. Maybe he did, but not by his own merit. He did this. The devil did this. And he was going after his daughter next. The final scene showed Pearl on her knees crying over the corpse of her father. The screen then showed the Bible verse Revelation 21:6. I knew the verse because I'm addicted to Fallout 3. At the bottom it said the name \"Daniel Montoy\".\n\n  Obviously after watching something like that, I didn't get any sleep. So I decided to do a little bit of investigating into who this was and why he made such a demented cartoon. Luckily, I found a few things.\n\n  After looking the name up, I found a little background to Spongebob in the process. Daniel Montoy was a student studying marine biology with Stephen Hillenburg. They both had an idea for a cartoon involving sea creatures that acted like humans. Montoy was a little unstable. He kept wanting to give the characters sociopathic qualities that Hillenburg didn't agree with. He wanted the show darker with more adult themes while Hillenburg was aiming for a children's cartoon. Their opinions eventually clashed ending in an unprovoked attack which left Hillenburg in critical condition and Montoy getting sent to a mental institution. He remained there from 1994 to August of 2013. He used stock footage of Spongebob scenes to create that demented episode I had seen. He wanted to get revenge. On the man who in his eyes threw him under the bus all those years ago. And he was angry. So there you have it. No demons. No haunted cartoons. No lost episodes. Just a guy with daddy issues seeking revenge. Was it creepy? He'll yes. It worked. I still wanna know how he got control of a broadcast tower to air his creation to the world. That remains a mystery.\n\n  Is there something we can learn from this? I would assume so. Just be careful who you piss off."},"378":{"title":"I knew Jim","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1oli9t\/i_knew_jim\/","flair":null,"author":"scoss","selftext":"Jim lost his job 6 years ago.

It was 2 in the morning and I was on the last episode when all of a sudden my laptop showed an error for the internet connection. I quickly got up and messed with the modem a bit, got another tub of vanilla ice cream then proceeded to sit back down.\n\nWhen I opened up my laptop it seemed to be working again. I finished the last episode then tried to find a new animated series. I found the Netflix original series \u201cHome:Adventures With Tip & Oh.\u201d I turned it on and started watching. Eventually that night I got to the newest season but when I tried to start it instead of getting the usual Netflix Original and Dreamworks logo I got just a screen of a black & white zoomed in picture of Tip with text saying: \u201cI see you at your computer.\u201d\n\nI was confused and scared. I skipped forward to the next episode thinking it might be different. It was the same thing. I skipped to the last episode of the season. This time it first played a Dreamworks logo with the Dreamworks mascot hanging from a noose. Instead of reading \u201cDreamworks\u201d it read: \u201cHe was hung. Not by himself but by you.\u201d\n\nNow this was really scaring me. The same image and text from the previous episodes appeared but now with eerily cheery music in the background. I exited the episode only to see on the home screen that everything on my list was now horror movies. I decided to turn off my laptop and just watch tv. But instead of finding a channel when I turned on the tv I found a error for my internet again. I went to modem but found I t had been smashed in half with a bloody handprint on the remains. I screamed. In blood on the wall it said: \u201cNo escaping your family.\u201d \n\nI went back to the couch only to find a headless Captain Underpants plush where I was previously sitting. I ran to the phone and dialed 911. Instead of getting the 911 dispatcher I got a message from Tip saying: \u201cI see you at your phone.\u201d Then hung up. I quickly ran to the bathroom to splash water on my face to help me calm down. When I looked up at the mirror when I was done I saw that the mirror was broken and found another blood message saying: \u201cI\u2019m taking the spotlight now.\u201d I then ran to the couch, went under my blanket and forced myself to sleep. \n\nThe next morning I woke up with a serious migraine. When I fully woke up I realized the house was on fire. I screamed then ran out of the house. Right on my front porch was a package addressed to me. I opened it. Inside was a Tip plush and a note. The note said: \u201cLook behind you.\u201d I quickly looked behind me. I saw nothing. Then I looked back at my hands. The package and note were gone but the plush wasn\u2019t. I quickly threw the Tip plush into the burning flames but when it started burning it let out a bloodcurdling scream of agony and pain. I ran away from the house. Luckily when all of this stuff went down my parents were still on their business trip. When they got back I lied about what caused the fire and just said that a tree fell down on the house and started the fire by also falling down on electrical wires then sparked and that caused it.\n\nWe moved into a new house a month later. When I finally got back to school I told my best friend everything. Obviously he didn\u2019t believe me. He said that if I show him proof then he would believe me. After school that day I walked home to find a package on the doorstep. My parents weren\u2019t home at that time. I opened the package on my bed. In it was a disc. On the disc it read: \u201cYour proof\u201d. I was a little nervous to bring that to school but I showed him it and he seemed impressed.\n\nHe came home with me and so we put it in the DVD player. It started playing the eerily cheery tune and picture with text. My friend seemed mesmerized. I looked up at the screen again I saw my friend hanging right next to the Dreamworks mascot. I looked back beside me. Instead of my friend being there it was Tip. Ever since that day I\u2019ve been forced to pretend nothing happened as no one else was able to see that my friend was replaced. \n\nShe told me that I can tell no one of what happened to me so now that I have written this I will surely be hung. And now that you\u2019ve read this, she\u2019s coming after you.

You sit on the toilet to jack off, but you begin to cum uncontrollably. After ten spurts you start to worry. Your hand is sticky and it reeks of semen. You desperately shove your dick into a wad of toilet paper, but that only makes your balls hurt. The cum accelerates. It\u2019s been three minutes. You can\u2019t stop cumming. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of baby fluid. You try to cum into the shower drain but it builds up too fast. You try the toilet. The cum is too thick to be flushed. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cum from escaping. The air grows hot and humid from the cum. The cum accelerates. You slip and fall in your own sperm. The cum is now six inches deep, almost as long as your still-erect semen hose. Sprawled on your back, you begin to cum all over the ceiling. Globs of the sticky white fluid begin to fall like raindrops, giving you a facial with your own cum. The cum accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cum begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a bukkake themed slip-and-slide. Still on your knees, the cum is now at chin height.

Your youngest child goes under, with viscous bubbles and muffled cries rising from the goop. You plead to God to end your suffering. The cum accelerates. You squeeze your dick to stop the cum, but it begins to leak out of your asshole instead. You let go. The force of the cum tears your urethra open, leaving only a gaping hole in your crotch that spews semen. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the cum.

The government deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cum sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the earth. You feel your gonads start to burn up as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new white paint job as you fly past. Physicists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The cum accelerates. The cum begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of semen. Astronomers begin calling you the \u201cCummet.\u201d You are stuck in space forever, stripped of your body and senses, forced to endure an eternity of cumshots. Eventually, you stop thinking.\n\nThe cum accelerates. You're now fully enveloped in its horrifying embrace, floating aimlessly in the abyss of space. Your senses are dulled; all that exists is the endless pulse of cum, a monstrous heartbeat echoing in the vacuum. Time becomes a meaningless concept, as does space. There is only cum and you. The cum accelerates. Astronomers on Earth track your cum trail, the 'cummet,' with a mix of horror and fascination. The cum begins to exert its own gravitational pull, capturing small bits of space debris, adding to the growing monstrosity. The cum accelerates. As Earth reels under the impending doom, an unlikely alliance forms between world leaders and the users of r KerbalSpaceProgram, renowned for its dedicated community of armchair rocket scientists. Urgent forum threads are populated with posts about trajectory simulations and frantic number crunching, fueled by fear, as they grapple with the real-life challenge. r theydidthemath dissects every scenario, every shift in the cum's trajectory with a feverish urgency. This newfound collaboration, coined the 'cumocalypse', results in an unprecedented unity among nations, each pledging resources to implement the internet-born solutions. Meanwhile, in the cold expanse of space, oblivious to the frantic activities on its home planet, the cum accelerates. Hope sparks amidst the chaos. Nations set aside age-old rivalries, focusing on the collective threat looming in the universe: the unstoppable cum. Together, they embark on a daring mission, pooling the planet's best minds and resources to construct the most massive starship ever built, its payload, an atomic weapon of unparalleled magnitude. This behemoth represents the best hope against the cum, the culmination of countless hours of rigorous trials, painstaking calculations, and sleepless nights. As the day of the launch arrives, the world holds its breath. The colossal ship roars into the heavens, its course set to intercept the source of the cum. But despite the meticulous planning and unified effort, the unthinkable happens. Upon detonation, the cum doesn't dissipate, it only feeds on the immense energy, growing at an even more alarming rate. The shock of the failed mission resonates around the globe. The cum accelerates.\n\nThe cum's gravitational pull escalates, its effects turning catastrophic. It begins to ensnare the Moon, pulling it from its celestial path, causing it to spiral uncontrollably towards the monstrous cum. As the Earth groans under the immense stress, crustal plates shatter, sending entire continents into a violent upheaval. Landmasses tear apart, forming turbulent rivers of earth and magma that twist and churn in the vacuum of space, converging towards the cum. The cum accelerates. The solar system quivers under the unstoppable force. Mars, Jupiter, even the distant Neptune, all fall prey to the growing cum's gravity. Their orbits destabilize, planets drawn away from the sun's hold, tumbling helplessly towards the monstrous entity. Planetary bodies and cum collide in a horrifying ballet of destruction and chaos, forming an enormous, ever-growing mass that violates all known laws of physics and reality. Inside this unholy mass, matter convulses and writhes, consumed by the unending churn of cum. Heat from countless planetary cores melds with the frigid cold of the space, creating an atmosphere of inhuman instability. Fire and ice, metal and rock, all dissolve into a single, roiling, cum-filled mass. From the darkest depths of this monstrous body, something stirs. Cthulhu fhtagn. Nightmares. The cum accelerates. \n\nA cosmic dread spreads through the Milky Way as the cum's gravitational distortions reach the sun. It wrenches the star from its ancient path, sending it careening towards the mass of cum in a blinding, apocalyptic arc. Solar flares lash out, their magnificence lost to the impending doom. The cum, now a blasphemous mix of celestial bodies and unending white sludge, continues to grow. It feeds on the planets, the stars, everything it touches, its malign influence rippling through the very fabric of the universe. Galactic bodies shudder, ancient constellations break apart, and the cosmic order unhinges as the fundamental forces of reality bend and warp under the insidious power of the cum. The cosmic horror is palpable, a sickening violation of the natural order. The cum accelerates.\n\nAmid this chaos, a presence stirs in the galactic center, the monstrous entity known as Sagittarius A, an ancient, unimaginable horror older than time itself. It observes the cum's obscene expansion with a terrible, inhuman consciousness. Sagittarius A feels a strange pull, a gravitational song that it has never known before. Fear, an emotion unknown to this cosmic behemoth, takes hold. Beneath the unimaginable pressure and otherworldly energies within the mass of cum, a cosmic nightmare awakens. The voice from the void, the echo from the abyss, reverberates through the cosmos: \"Cthulhu wakes.\" The prophecy of doom echoes through the cosmos. The cum accelerates. \n\nAlien civilizations from distant galaxies, those whispered of in hushed tones, watch in powerless horror as the universe they knew begins to distort and disintegrate under the cum's relentless advance. The Elder Things, the star-headed beings of inconceivable age and wisdom, sense the aberration in the cosmic order, their ancient city trembling with dread. The confrontation between Cthulhu and the cum commences, strikes at the cum with a fury born of primal fear and wrath. Cthulhu lets loose a psychic scream that reverberates back and forward through space-time, but the cum accelerates. Slowly, inevitably, Cthulhu's form is enveloped, the eldritch horror silenced and consumed by the unending whiteness. The cum has defeated the undefeatable, consumed the cosmic horror, and now, unchallenged, it continues its horrifying spread across the cosmos. The cum accelerates. \n\nEntire galaxies tremble in the cum's path, their starlight dimming and eventually succumbing to the insidious white tide. Stellar clusters, cosmic gas clouds, entire galaxies, none are spared as the cum extends its horrifying dominion. The Elder Things watch in mute despair as their grand cosmic tapestry unravels, their timeless wisdom powerless against this unprecedented threat. Their loss echoes through the dying cosmos, a profound silence in the wake of their destruction. Finally, the boundary of time itself begins to buckle, the relentless advance of the cum eroding the very fabric of reality. Moments stretch into infinity, while eons flash by in the blink of an eye. The universe, once bound by the order of time, is consumed by chaos.\n\nThe cum accelerates. In the midst of the impenetrable whiteness, a spark flickers. A small shift, a tremor within the all-consuming cum. From its indomitable mass, a torrent of energy is expelled. Not with the explosive force of a big bang, but with the undeniable, vital surge of a big spurt. The cosmos, once blanketed in the horrifying stillness, now trembles with renewed vitality. Elementary particles burst into existence, whirling and combining to form atoms. The darkness of the void is pierced by the birth of stars, their brilliant light illuminating the newborn universe. Atoms bond into molecules, forming cosmic dust, the building blocks of celestial bodies. In the crucible of gravity and heat, planets form around their nascent suns, galaxies bloom, and the cosmic dance resumes. Life sparks into being, filling the vast expanses of space with a renewed sense of hope and purpose. A new epoch begins, one born of cum but now free from its monstrous reign. The universe, once a canvas of destruction, is now a testament to rebirth and resilience. Yet, somewhere in the recesses of this resurgent cosmos, a silent whisper persists. The universe, in all its grandeur and glory, remains oblivious to this harbinger. For within the heart of a distant star, the raw materials of creation coalesce. A dick is forming, quietly heralding the return of the cosmic nightmare. The cycle continues. Someday, somewhere, there will be another dick.\n\nThe cum accelerates. The new universe, birthed by the Big Spurt, becomes an anomaly, a defiant blip in the harmonious expanse of the multiverse. Its unique genesis grants it an unexpected dominance, its reality spreading and overpowering the delicate balance of myriad realities born from countless Big Bangs. As the dominion of the Big Spurt universe expands, the multiverse convulses, realities clashing, merging, and dissolving in unimaginable cataclysms. Boundaries blur, realities bleed into one another, and soon the cum of the dominant universe starts seeping into the others, each being invaded by the relentless tide of cum. Worlds, galaxies, realities - all drowned in the ever-encroaching whiteness, their existence reduced to mere echoes. The cum accelerates.\n\nIn the void between universes, the celestial entities of the multiverse, timeless entities that presided over the orderly progression of realities, shudder in horrified anticipation. Among them, Chronos, the embodiment of time across all realities, feels the steady tick-tock of countless universes slow, then falter under the suffocating weight of the cum. Nex, the weaver of destinies, sees the rich tapestry of possible futures diminish, replaced by the stark whiteness of the cum. Ananke, the guardian of necessity, who ensures that each universe follows its predestined path, helplessly watches as the cum derails realities, replacing the plurality of existence with a singular, nightmarish destiny. The cum accelerates.\n\nThese multiversal beings, once the pillars of existence, now stand helpless against the horrifying onslaught of the cum. Their ethereal forms struggle and twist, suffocating in the advancing tide of the cum. Each god, in its horrifying splendor, buckles and breaks under the ceaseless, unyielding pressure. The cum invades their forms, quenching the cosmic energy that fuels their existence. Their cries of despair echo through the dying multiverse, a haunting dirge for the dying possibilities and the end of their reign. The cum accelerates. One by one, they fall silent, their divine lights snuffed out, replaced by the infinite, unending whiteness of the cum.\n\nAs the last echo of their existence fades, all that remains is a solitary universe amidst a sea of cum, an isolated reality in what was once a vibrant multiverse of infinite possibilities. A lone testament to existence, while the rest of the multiverse is drowned in unimaginable amounts of cum. All previous and other universes, all the possibilities that once existed, are now dead. Replaced by a single, dominating reality, born from the Big Spurt. \n\nThe cum accelerates. \n\nIts appetite unsated by the consumption of countless universes, it seeks new horizons to devour. Now, it breaks the shackles of three-dimensional space, its formless creamy mass seeping into the very fabric of higher dimensions. These are planes of existence beyond the grasp of human understanding, worlds with more dimensions than our mere trio of width, height, and depth.The cum accelerates. Still, the cum pervades them all, spreading its congealing influence into dimensions both minuscule and vast, warping their uncanny geometry with its insidious presence. Every dimensional fold, every unseen corner of these abstract spaces trembles at the monstrous intruder. The cum accelerates.\n\nIn the human world of the one final universe, this intrusion manifests in unimaginable ways. The laws of physics start to contort and twist, as if mirrored through a warped lens. Gravity fluctuates, reality distorts, and space itself appears to warp and bend in incomprehensible patterns. Yet these are but the fringes of the true horror, mere echoes of the devastation occurring in dimensions beyond human perception. The cum accelerates.\n\nReality teeters on the brink of madness, the dimensions beyond comprehension convulsing under the insidious advance of the cum. The known and unknown, the seen and unseen, everything becomes the feeding ground of the all-devouring cum.The cum accelerates.The cum never ends. The cum accelerates. The cum now transcends the boundaries of the material world. It extends its terrifying reach into the realm of the abstract, its insatiable hunger turning towards concepts that were once thought immune to physical influence. Clocks lose meaning as seconds stretch into millennia and eons collapse into moments. Past, present, and future blur into a formless swirl, a chaotic mess of events happening all at once and not at all. The flow of causality, the chain of cause and effect, begins to break down. Actions occur without reason, effects precede causes, and logic itself starts to unravel. The cum accelerates.\n\nProbability falls prey to the cum. All events, regardless of their likelihood, begin to happen simultaneously. The possible and the impossible, the likely and the unlikely, all become one and the same in this new cum-infused reality. A coin flip lands on both heads and tails, it rains upwards, cats converse in human languages, all while remaining perfectly normal. The lines between absurdity and reality are irrevocably blurred. The cum accelerates. Emotion itself succumbs to the cum. Sentient beings feel their emotions draining away, replaced by an all-encompassing void. Joy, sorrow, anger, love, all dissolve into the ever-growing mass of cum, leaving behind a chilling emptiness. People wander aimlessly, their eyes hollow and devoid of feeling, their lives reduced to monotonous grayness. The essence of what makes life meaningful, the ability to feel, is consumed. The cum accelerates.\n\nExistence is twisted into an uncanny, cum-filled nightmare where nothing makes sense anymore. The very threads of reality are fraying, on the brink of total collapse. Through it all, one thing remains constant - the horrifying, relentless, and unstoppable force that is the cum.\n\nThe cum accelerates. \n\nThe assault on higher dimensions and the absorption of abstract concepts has left the laws of physics in a state of disarray. Now, as the cum continues its unstoppable advance, these laws begin to falter in earnest, the fine balance of reality teetering on the brink of collapse. Gravity no longer pulls but pushes, electromagnetic forces are twisted, reducing the vibrant universe to a monochrome of pure white. The cum accelerates.Particles of matter and anti-matter no longer annihilate upon contact, but fuse, creating disturbing hybrids that further distort the fabric of reality. Energy and mass interchange at will, unbound by the constraints of the famous E=mc2. Light itself bends around invisible corners, shying away from the insidious cum. The cum accelerates.\n\nQuantum superpositions become mundane reality; Schr\u00f6dinger's cat is simultaneously alive and dead, in this universe and in all annihilated universes. Uncertainty no longer reigns in the quantum world; particles occupy definite positions and momentum. The eerie world of quantum mechanics, once a mystery, now seems almost normal compared to the cum-induced chaos. The cum accelerates.Then, slowly, an unholy event begins to unfold. A concentration of cum, grown to an unfathomable size from consuming countless universes, begins to collapse under its own gravitation. Matter, energy, abstract concepts, all are crushed under the immense gravitational force, compacted into an ever-shrinking sphere of cum. The cum accelerates.\n\nAll the while, the laws of physics twist and turn around this anomaly. Time stands still, then races backwards, only to freeze again. Space stretches, twists, and turns upon itself. But the worst is yet to come. As the mass of cum collapses to an infinitesimal point, a singularity is born. This singularity is not just a spatial anomaly, but a singularity in reality itself \u2013 a point where all known laws of physics cease to exist. The cum accelerates.\n\nThe cum singularity is a paradox, an absurdity. It is everything and nothing, everywhere and nowhere. It is the birth and death of the universe, the Alpha and Omega. It is the embodiment of contradiction, where all possible outcomes happen simultaneously. The boundaries between reality and abstraction dissolve. The singularity devours itself, only to regurgitate its own existence. Around this singularity, the universe twists and turns, contorting into impossible shapes. But still, the cum accelerates.\n\nFaced with this horrifying reality, existence teeters on the brink of total collapse. The fabric of the universe, once a beautiful tapestry of matter, energy, and abstract concepts, is now a torn, ragged remnant, twisted around the singularity. A maddening, inescapable vortex of cum, the singularity warps all of existence around it. The cum accelerates, and the singularity continues to consume, a monstrous testament to the horrifying power of the cum. \n\nThe cum accelerates.\n\nIts formless mass continues to swell, its monstrous influence creeping beyond the confines of the physical, the abstract, seeping into the very narrative that defines its existence. Boundaries blur, words seem to distort, to warp and twist in uncanny patterns upon the page. The cum accelerates.\n\nEach sentence, each word seems to ripple, their rigid structure softened, molding into the unending whiteness of the cum. Lines of text merge and flow, a river of words succumbing to the relentless tide. It is as if the written reality of the cum itself is starting to shake, the very fabric of the narrative warping under its influence. The cum accelerates.\n\nOn the edge of your perception, a whisper of change, a barely noticeable shift in the environment. The text on your screen, once static and safe, now pulses with a life of its own, an echo of the cum's monstrous heartbeat. Your surroundings seem to flicker, a momentary ripple that's gone as quickly as it arrives, leaving a lingering unease. The cum accelerates.\n\nYou shake your head, attributing it to a trick of the light, to fatigue, to anything but the impossible reality. But even as you read on, that silent whisper persists. The story, once a separate entity, now feels closer, an integral part of your reality. The cum accelerates.\n\nA chill runs down your spine, unexplained, unwelcome. The shadows in the room seem deeper, the silence more profound. Each line of the story that you read, each mention of the cum's unending acceleration, makes the air grow colder, the world a bit quieter. You can't shake off the feeling of being watched, of being a part of something greater, something... terrifying. The cum accelerates.\n\nIn the depths of your mind, fear begins to stir. The once harmless tale now feels tainted with a sense of impending doom. The narrative has transcended its own realm, its horrifying echo reverberating in the corners of your consciousness. The cum accelerates.\n\nYour heartbeat quickens, echoing the rhythm of the accelerating cum. The room darkens, your vision blurs. The screen, the room, your very existence feel threatened by the monstrous force known as the cum. As reality distorts, you see the words before you warp and twist, their forms replaced by a familiar, horrifying whiteness. The cum accelerates."},"393":{"title":"Continue File #666","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/2vuh0y\/continue_file_666\/","flair":null,"author":"RealCollegeStudunt","selftext":"I am college student who lives alone in a dorm and gotted Nostalgia for the good old days.

I am 16 years old. When i was 5 my parents divorced and that did not traumatized me for i was already damaged from the very beginning. A few days passed and my mother brought a man over. My mother at that moment told that this man was my new father so i called him that the moment he took a step into my mom\u2019s apartment. My sister was furious with me for calling him dad she was about 12 when it happened. I understood what had happened i knew my parent weren't doing well from the beginning. i slept with them on the same bed till the day they got divorced. I used to be very close to everyone i knew i was especially close to my dad, but since then every time i visit him we would feel like strangers. Every time i met him it became more and more awkward. when my dad finally got a wife they had children. Now he has a very big family for him to take care of. I no longer visit as often since i can't handle noise people especially younger humans.\n As i got older i started to notice that i dont give real emotions to people. I got into the relationship industry and does were the only times people noticed who i really am. They would become distant so i stopped ever showing who i was. now people think of me as the kid that is innocent as is fragile but what they know is that. what they see  isn't real. i even convinced my family that i'm actually like this. Honestly i just wish that the person i act to be\u2026. i wish i was actually that. I'm afraid\u2026.that i  wont be able to feel anymore. at this moment i can only feel pain not mentally but physically. Thats the only thing keeping me human. i'm afraid that the string i'm hanging on to is going to snap at any moment. Everything i've ever seen has been black and white but now everything is turning grey.

How do I know this? I went to the nickelodeon studio and I found a safe. For some reason, it wasn't locked. So of course, I looked in it and found a book. I looked in it and there was newspaper articles about deaths. I snuck it home and read it. I will tell you the story about the humans that inspired a cartoon about sea life.\n The Bikini Bottom was built in the late 1830s in California. MR. Krabs, Who's real name was Eugene, was born there in 1841. His father abandoned him and his mother, who were always poor. When he first discovered money, he became obsessed with it. He and his mother eventually gained thousands of dollars. His mother eventually died of natural causes in 1884, at the age of 72. Eugene went to the navy shortly after, and died from drowning in the ocean after jumping off the battleship to swim to a chest of gold on an island in 1899 at age 58. The ship was blown up shortly after.\n Squidward, who's real name is unknown, was born an exact year after the navy tragedy in 1900. He was born with a heart condition and was bullied for it. He became depressed and tried committing suicide several times. He finally succeeded in 1934 by hanging himself. He was 34.\n SpongeBob was born in 1936. He was always friendly to people, even people who bullied him, as they often did. When WWII was hitting full swing in his hometown, his parents sent him to Bikini Bottom when he was only 5 years old in 1941. His parents were killed by Hitler in 1943. He didn't have many friends. But he always looked at the bright side of things. Sadly, he developed manic depression. He was an early drug user. He began thinking things were there such as voices and people, but they really weren't. As a result, on his 21st birthday party in 1957, he overdosed on drugs. His fake friends were at his side. His cat Gary starved to death a few days later.\n Patrick was born minutes after SpongeBob died. He fell off his bike when he was 10 years old and developed brain damage. His only friend was SpongeBob's ghost. He went to a special aid class because of the brain damage. One day, he was having a moment of stupidity. He drove his bike off a hill and died at age 18 in 1975.\n Sandy was born in Texas in 1978, and moved to Bikini Bottom in 1985. She was a very good student, and science was her best subject. She was also gifted in karate. But one day in 1998, she messed up on a science project demonstration in her collage and the chemicals caught on fire and blew Bikini Bottom college up. She was 20 years old.\n A dwarf man named Sheldon ( Plankton ) started researching this story ever since and in 2002, he was stabbed to death by a gang member. He was 60 years old. Sheldon was a crazed conspiracy researcher.\n The book said: \"By Sheldon p.\" So he documented all of these deaths in a scrap book of which I have in my safe.\n The show started on the hundredth anniversary of Eugene's death in 1999. Sheldon helped create the show.\n Bikini Bottom is still up today, but has been shut down in 2009. But, the ghosts are still there. Everybody who visited there since have all died in a painful way. And even committed suicide.\n\n What a twisted truth for a kids show.\n\n If you don't believe me, visit there yourself.\n\n SpongeBob and his friends will be waiting.\n \n  \n\n"},"409":{"title":"(Possible NSFW) As usual","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/3rzpsv\/possible_nsfw_as_usual\/","flair":null,"author":"FluffyBurrito63","selftext":"As I pulled into my driveway, I only had one thing on my mind: her.

It stopped with a lurch and I almost lost my footing. I picked up my duffel bag and strut down the plank. The town was small and foggy. I saw only 3 cars driving. I looked at my watch, before contemplating the time I realized I hadn\u2019t changed it to this time zone. I asked a small studded man in a dark leather trench coat if he knew the time. \u201c11:30 tonight.\u201d He said with a grin. \u201cNo no, I mean the time right now.\u201d I knew it wasn\u2019t already almost midnight, too bright for that. He just turned away and sauntered off. I walked to the motel where Tran said I would be staying. I walked through the bar downstairs, Tran\u2019s Cousin Kent greeting me near the stairs. He was drunk.  He began to shout \u201cHeyyyyyyy, Saang?...\u201d What an idiot. \u201cUm its Song actually.\u201d I muttered, embarrassed. \u201cYeeah okay. \u4f60\u600e\u4e48\u6837\u7684\u4eba\uff1f\u201d I had been taught to not speak Chinese when I got to the states.

He muttered some Chinese curses. \u201cI must have dropped it in here somewhere.\u201d Fantastic. \n\tI sat down at the bar and looked at my watch again. The small mans words rang through my head. \u201c11:30 tonight\u201d There was something unsettling about it, maybe it was how skinny he was, or the dead look in his eyes, or how his terrifying grin revealed his crooked black teeth, or even his limp. I leaned over to the girl next to me, man she was attractive, \u201cExcuse me miss, do you have the time?\u201d She reached into her purse, pulled out her cell phone, and turned it on. \u201c2:26 am. I really should go home, I\u2019ve been here all night.\u201d She didn\u2019t seem like the kind to pull an all nighter at a bar but I guess I didn\u2019t know America. \u201cI hear there\u2019s a really cool circus tonight. I\u2019m gonna go get some sleep, call me if you want to go with.\u201d She handed me a folded up napkin with a 7-digit number on it. I\u2019d never used a cell phone before but Tang gave me one when he sent me off to the states. I changed my watch, and realized that that was what was at 11:30. But why did they have such a scary little advertise it? So many questions came from this peaceful little town.\n\tI was exploring the town, looking through the eerie little shops, when my phone rang. It was Kent. His drunken voice boomed through the speaker. \u201cHeyy Sang. I f-found your room key! Meet me at the bar and you can go get some sleep! Yeah? That\u2019ll be nice right? After such a lo-\u201c I cut him off, \u201cAlright Kent I\u2019m on my way!\u201d \u201cGreat! I\u2019ll be waiting! \u548c\u5e73\u4e86!\u201d His voice cut out as he slammed the payphone. I was glad to hear I could finally rest. After reaching the motel and getting my key I went up to my room, A15. It had one two person bed, a small box tv, an alarm clock, and a small bathroom. I lay down and set an alarm for 10. My dream was dark, with flashes of different terrifying things. The old man, dolls with oddly realistic skin, a scrawny monkey with rage in his eyes. The monkey dove at me and I snapped awake. I looked at the clock, 9:30 pm. Only a few hours of sleep. I called the girl. We decided to meet at the circus, she gave me the location and we meet at 11:30. After taking a cab up the mountainous trail we arrived at a plain that had a ring of circus tent surrounding the area, with many different tents inside.\n\tI waited until 12:30 she never showed. I walked up to the booth and bought a ticket from a man wearing one of those bird witch doctor masks. When I entered I immediately was engulfed in the stench of rotting flesh. When I looked above at the hanging lights, hanging with them were dolls, covered in flesh that looked almost human. I couldn\u2019t be here. Every ounce of me wanted to bolt back through those gates, hail a cab, and get back to my motel. That\u2019s what I did, well tried to do at least. I ran towards the gate when another witch doctor stepped in front of me. \u201cAll paying customers must attend\u201d He boomed out. My eyes filled with tears. I didn\u2019t want to be here. I looked around at all the smiling families. What was wrong with these people. After collecting myself in a nearby port-o-potty, I wandered a bit. The food looked green and the water looked yellow. The smell had ruined my appetite anyway. I approached a tent. \u201cAstonishing Freakshow!\u201d The sign claimed. \u201cPrepare to be amazed!\u201d I might as well enjoy myself the best I can. I regret walking through those tent flaps. I regret buying the ticket, coming to the states, talking to that girl, getting kissed by a drunk Kent. I regret meeting Pang. Because what I saw in that tent was something that will be cemented into my brain until the day I die. The stage was empty but the seats were filling up. I took a seat near a family and a crotchety old woman. When all seats were taken two witch doctors stepped in front of flaps and the lights went out. Up-beat piano music rang out like one of those silent films. A man came dancing out wearing a mask that was half cat half dog. He sang out, \u201cWelcome to our show! Youre in for treat, but don\u2019t get too scared, hang on to your seat. We promise we\u2019re your friend, just stay till the end. And enjoy the mystical talents of what the world dragged out of hell\u201d That didn\u2019t rhyme. Witch doctors wheeled out a man tied to a spinning circle. The dog-cat pulled out four knives. He lined up the first and missed the man\u2019s head by a hair. The next knife stabbed the man in the chest with a hard thump. I gasped and looked around, no one seemed phased. In fact their smiles grew. The child of the family near me stood on his chair and shouted, \u201cAnother!\u201d The dog-cat shot another knife at the man and it sliced through his neck. Everybody cheered as the man fell limp. They wheeled him back stage. When I looked at the door, the witch doctors stared back at me. There was no escape. The room went dark for a few seconds and when they came back, there was a large blanket shrouding something cube like. The dog-cat ripped down the blanket, revealing a cage, inside was an over famished chimpanzee. They must have starved him while training. That\u2019s when it hit me. My dream was this hell. He opened the cage and the chimp jumped out and hung on his arm. \u201cThis is my good friend Clarice.\u201d The dog-cat announced. Clarice swung about as if she understood him. They preformed silly tricks like patty-cake and playing catch. He then pulled out a cracker and handed it to Clarice. He removed his own mask revealing a dashing young man no older than 20. He pulled her up onto his shoulder and instructed her to feed him. She held the cracker between her pointer and middle finger. She placed it gently inside his mouth but instead of pulling her hand out, she gripped his chin and ripped it clean off his face. Everybody laughed and cheered. Where was I? Is this hell? Or did that boat just take me to \u201cFuckedUpVille\u201d But I couldn\u2019t leave. The man fell to his knees. Clarice jumped around and howled and let out ear splitting screams. When the lights went out she went silent. Then within a few seconds, terrifyingly high piano music snapped the silence. A much dimmer light shone right on a man. But he didn\u2019t move nor did he have arms. Just a normal amputee anybody would think until he looked up. His eyes were sunken in and the only skin he had left was a mixture of grey and red splotches. The 4 hairs that draped around his ears were jet black. His teeth were exposed and they were black, tar covered, and cracked. What kind of monster is this? What kind of monster would put him in a showcase? I thought Mr. Dog-Cat was running the show but he\u2019s gone now. The \u201canother\u201d child made the horrible mistake of stepping to the side to tie his shoes. The thing\u2019s head snapped over to him and he sprinted with all he had at him. It stomped on the child and began to eat his face. The parents just laughed with everybody else.\n\tAfter they were removed, the up-beat music began again. A man in a suit and top hat came out, he was a magician. After doing lame average magic tricks, he called for a volunteer. I knew that whoever went up there would surely be killed, and I think they all knew that too. I stepped up. He pulled out a person in one of those \u201cget sawed in half\u201d tricks. He handed me a saw, \u201cGo right ahead. Chop her up.\u201d Those last words chilled my bones. I placed the saw on the top of it began to saw. The feet sticking out of the bottom weren\u2019t fake like they should have been. Once I got to her, she flinched. But she didn\u2019t react at all other than that. I had to stop. I pulled out the saw and threw it on the ground. Everybody booed and hissed. It was horrible they were all horribly angry at me. The lights went out and I felt a rag being forced into my mouth. I squirmed and kicked, but within seconds I passed out. \n\tWhen I woke up I was tied to a chair in a pitch black room. When the light above me turned on, there were too witch doctors and the girl from the bar in front of me. She leaned in close and calmly uttered 5 words into me ear. \u201cYou should have played nicely.\u201d She walked away authoritatively. The witch doctors removed their masks and leaned in close. They were hideous. Their faces were mangled to where they looked like somebody blew up a water melon and tried to stitch back together with one hand. I don\u2019t know what they did to me. It was the most painful thing I had ever experienced.\n\tBut now it\u2019s my turn. I can hear their cheering voices waiting for me to put on a show. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll give them. When the curtains opened, my tank was wheeled out and I showed them my mermaid like tail. The freak show is all I have left."},"412":{"title":"Why didn't Australia warn the US about 9\/11?","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/1ir7otm\/why_didnt_australia_warn_the_us_about_911\/","flair":"Trollpasta Story","author":"SpliT2ideZ","selftext":"I think it's a valid question.

In our relationship it was ready to evolve to motherhood and fatherhood and family was the next thing. A family would really make things good, and all relationships evolves to having a family. Recently things have seemed pointless and now a child will bring more purpose to my life. \n\nI am grateful because a lot of relationships don't evolve to the family part. Most relationships don't have money or they just don't feel ready. Our relationship has and I even have the time to be a father. As we got ready for the child and we made the baby room and got all the baby clothes, things were really coming back home now with us becoming a family. Normality has gone out the window and a new normal is coming in now. \n\nThen when I was in the Labor room and the baby came out, I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe that it was deaths baby and she cheated on me with death. The baby came out not being alive. How could she have done this to me and for everything we have done. It was so humiliating and we buried the baby and nobody was talking about what my wife did. \n\nThen I had to confront her and she promised that it was my baby and not deaths. I believed her as it was so sincere. Then one day I saw her going somewhere outside when she should have been at work. She went to some old building and down some cellars. In this cellar were male dead bodies who have just been recently pronounced dead. There were other women there as well, and they all reproduced with the dead male bodies. \n\nAfter a couple of days she told me we were pregnant with a child again. I confronted her and she didn't try to lie or make up excuses for what she had done. She simply said \"death deserves children!\" And she broke a few things around the house. Death reproduces through dead males.

Usually robbers rob people with money or valuables but I don't. I target those who don't have much at all or living on the bread line. They are my favourites and I have even robbed homeless people as well. A lot of people don't understand me but you see what I am robbing from poor people, is not a physical monetary thing but I am robbing their love and warmth to each other. You see I come from a rich family but we have no love and warmth to each other. \n\nPoor people tend to stay together and they socialise and they have this warmth with one and another, which my rich family are missing. I robbed a lower working class family and I robbed their love and warmth to each other. When I went home it was amazing to feel the warmth and love in my own family. It only lasts for a couple of hours but it is amazing. My family are laughing and enjoying being in each other's company. When I look back at the poor working class family that I had robbed, no longer are they just poor but they have now lost the warmth and care to each other. \n\nOther rich families also pay me to rob poor people. One rich family paid me to steal from a poor family. I stole from the poor family their happiness and joy in life. I then gave it to the miserable depressed rich family and they became happy, joyous and grateful. When I rob from poor families their faith, joy, gratefulness and warmth they do tend to die no so long after. I am very good at robbing poor people, but recently I have found a new set of poor people to rob from. \n\nThere poor people in 3rd world countries who are being slaughtered and tortured, but they still have so much happiness and faith. I have been robbing them and my family and other rich families have been feeling the exhilaration of life. We have so love towards life and each other while poor tortured souls we robbed from in 3rd world countries, just whither away. When you have that much warmth, love, faith and excitement in life it doesn't matter how much life hurts you. When you take those things away, only then will you be broken."},"419":{"title":"I'm Being Stalked by Slenderman","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/creepypasta\/comments\/5hqax2\/im_being_stalked_by_slenderman\/","flair":null,"author":"LexiTheCat","selftext":"Hi everybody... or whoever is reading this. You can tell by the title that this is a story about the mythical being called Slenderman. I bet you're already shaking your head at this, ready to see what drama a teenage fan is going to type. You can go ahead and doubt this story. You can send me hate, say it's fake, and laugh at how stupid you think this story is. But it really doesn't matter what any of you do. I'm typing this for me, because I have nobody to talk to. I just need to get this off my chest, if I told anybody face-to-face they'd think I'm crazy, and you probably do too. Only two people know what's happening to me, but that's not enough. So anyways, let's start from the beginning.\n\nI'm a teenage girl, and I remember this starting off in the beginning of last summer. My parents worked constantly over the summer, leaving me alone with my twin sister, and my younger brother. For privacy, let's call my sister Ann and my brother Tom. \nI'm a introvert, I've always been. My parents never let us leave the house while they were gone, so you can guess that I spent nearly my entire summer indoors. That's when I started watching Marble Hornets. If any of you aren't familiar, Marble Hornets is basically a YouTube series based off of a being like Slenderman, called the Operator. I bet you can find tons of better explanations than mine.\nI remember binge watching the series, because at the time I was in a \"Creepypasta phase\" and I needed something to do.\nThat night is when I remember first feeling it. I'm a competitive gymnast, but I'm quitting sometime soon. Anyways, that night I was at my gym, watching the olympics with the other girls and boys who went. I suddenly remember having a feeling of being watched. I looked around the gym, until I found myself staring out the window. It was completely black outside, as it was about 9 at night. The feeling of being watched was unimaginable, and I could hear a faint ringing in my ears. But I scolded myself in my head. Just like every \"Creepypasta fan\" I wanted to become one, so I chalked it up to me just making it all up in my head. Now, I wish that was true.\nI had the feeling of being watched and horrible anxiety for weeks, and by that point I didn't even want to hear the word \"Slenderman\". I didn't know what was happening, and I had no one to talk to.\nI couldn't tell my family, so I decided to do something risky. \nMy best friend, whom I'll call Stacey, had moved away at the time, so the only way we talked was via text message. \nI remember coming back from seeing a movie (my mom was off from work that day), and I randomly decided to tell Stacey. I don't know why, because if she didn't believe me it would've ruined my relationship with her, but I was desperate for someone to talk to. I don't remember exactly what we said, as I hardly remember any of summer now a days, but I can give you a basic idea.\n\nMe: Hey Stac(my nickname for her)... Can I ask you something?\n\nHer: Yeah? What?\n\nMe: Do you believe in Slenderman?\n(It took her a good 5 minutes to respond, and I remember my heart racing. I was worried that she'd think I'm crazy, and this would be the last time we talked)\n\nHer: Why?\n\nMe: Well let's just say I've been dealing with some stuff and... I believe he's real..\n\nHer: Holy shit.... Lex (my nickname) I've been dealing with him for years... what's been happening to you?\n---------\nAnd that's when I found out that she's been stalked by Slenderman too. She's been dealing with him ever since she was 8. Part of me feels bad for telling her, as now Stacey believes that she drew Slenderman to me. But I will never blame her.\n\nI have tons of stories of all the things that have happened, but I honestly am losing my memory. My life is a mess. I haven't had a good night of sleep in months, I have horrible anxiety, and I have to see a therapist. I hate lying to the therapist, and even talking to her, but I have to pull a straight face. I'm not letting my parents find out just so they can throw me into some asylum. My friends and even my teachers have noticed how different I am, and I really don't know what to do. Soon I'm not going to be able to hide it. I hate being around people. I have zero trust for even my family, and now I don't even enjoy holidays any more. \nMy life is falling apart and I'm not even an adult yet. Hell, I'm too young to even drive.\nBut I refuse to quit. My grades in school haven't failed because i keep working hard. Part of me stills hopes, no scratch that, prays that this is all part of my imagination. That soon this will all be over. But as the days go on, I can't lie to myself anymore.\nIt's going to be Christmas soon, and I asked for a camcorder. I'm going to start recording myself at night. I'll crop out and block out anything in my room that will lead to my true identity, but I'll post any evidence that I find.\nThat's it. That's the introduction to the long line of horror that's been happening to me. I'd post more but this is already long enough, and I think I'll wait a bit. Next time I update, I'll go into further detail of the stories I've had, but for now this is it.\nThank you for reading, and I hope that you enjoyed this story.

Okay, long story short.. i had an argument with an atheist, saying god does not exist. We were talking there for several hours, and then.. i realized it had been 8 hours. After i went to sleep, i heard my phone making notifications.. when i read them, they were his comments.. i was getting mad. But i managed to shut down the phone and sleep for the rest of the night. Tomorrow i again.. started to argue with him. Then went that shocking moment, when he said. \"Faggot. Give me your address and we will sort it out\". I was around 18 at the time, so i did have responsibility, i gave him my address. He was chatting to me the entire day, arguing about god not being real. After around 3 hours.. it was about time the bell rang. I said: My parents aren't home, please go away. The man who was at the door left. I got the feeling i was punched it in the stomach.. it could be the one who argued with me. After 8 hours, sleeping.. eating, all that stuff. It was about time i told my parents about this.. here's a little conversation:\nMe: Mom, i.. told someone our home address.\nMom: WHAT?!\nDad: DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT COULD HAPPEN?\nBla bla bla, i ignored them.. i felt like the guy who argued was probably around 13 trying to fight me, not knowing my real age.\nTomorrow i wake up. It was a sunny morning. I sat down, my father was very stressful, and said: \"Our dog was killed last night.\"\nThe feeling came back, i was feeling so bad.. i wanted to jump out of the window for doing what i had. Oh, by the way.. the guy hadn't wrote any comment since i told him my address.  My dad and i went out for shopping, leaving my mom and my little brother, alone. When i was back home, i couldn't open my eyes.. i would just kill myself at that point.. but here i am, alive. I.. saw the door, broken down. I ran with the fastest speed i could to see where my mother was, i grabbed the kitchen knife to be safe. My dad got attacked, he died.. on the ground. My mother was on the ground with my little brother. Oh god.. what have i done. I quickly opened my eyes wide, looking at a 45 year old man saying: Where was your god while these people died? Hmhmhmhmhm. It was him, the guy who would text me every night, he blacked my world, i didn't die though, that's how i am writing this.

The city was called Seacity. It was built under the sea in a big dome. The people of Seacity loved entertainment but the ting they loved most was the Seacity Zoo. In the Seacity Zoo there were many exhibits, the least popular one being the sea monkeys.\n\nThere were three sea monkeys. Their names were Sally, Earl, and Ann. They were constantly abused by their hideous Seacity captors who had enslaved them as babies \u2013 taking them away from their homes to live in the zoo. They were trained to do tricks and be nice, in the process breaking many bones. Their captors were cruel and played rough with the sea monkeys. \n\nOne day there was a breach in the glass dome ceiling of the Seacity ceiling. Everything was sucked up the hole because of the pressure difference. Nothing survived except the sea monkeys. \n\nThe sea monkeys were finally free! They rejoiced and cried in their joy, but then they realized they had nowhere to go, nowhere to be, except up. They had to learn how to breathe air. They had trained how to do many other things so this wouldn\u2019t be too much more difficult. So they slowly but surely started breathing; small shallow breaths at first, then longer better breaths.\n\nNow, I haven\u2019t really described what sea monkeys look like. These are futuristic air-breathing sea monkeys now and were small enough to reach into ones ear canal and curl up in the palm of your hand all cute and snuggly. They were see-through and blueish in tint, but seriously the cutest things you ever saw. \n\nOnce they learned how to breathe air they needed to learn how to crawl like worms on land. This was relatively easy to learn because it was the same motion they would use to swim. \n\nNow, there is something I forgot to mention about Seacity. It was very close to the Bermuda triangle, and the city would sink many ships in order to find its meat. Normal sea monkeys ate seaweed and beautiful shellfish, but the trainers were so cruel. They took the rotting brains of the sunken humans and force fed them to the sea monkeys. They cried but sooner or later they got used to it, they just wished it wasn\u2019t rotten, and were curious as to if it would taste better if it was fresh.\n\nOnce they reached land and started crawling on the ground, only being a couple millimeters long, they waited. They were on the Florida beaches. Thousands of hot babes floundering about, and little toddlers with their mommies. \n\n\u201cMommy!\u201d said one girl, scooping up Sally, Earl, and Ann, \u201cLookit! They are like tiny little cute worms!\u201d \nThe child couldn\u2019t have been more than four. \n\nThe sea monkeys\u2026 they sniffed\u2026\n\nWhat is that beautiful smell they exclaimed. They found it was coming from\u2026 up there. They slowly crawled up her arm, and up her shoulder, \u2018til they reached just behind her ear. The smell was very strong now. They crawled inside one by one, and soon they found the glorious grey matter that was the child\u2019s brains and started digging with their little cute incisors into her cute four year old brain. The child died in less than five minutes. By this time, the sea monkeys had grown to twice their original size.\n\nMMM WASN\u2019T THAT SCRUMPTIOUS said Earl, YESSS said Sally. IT TRULY WAS DELICIOUS said Ann.\n\nThey burrowed through her decaying skull into the moist sand beneath, as to not be seen and at night they escaped.
