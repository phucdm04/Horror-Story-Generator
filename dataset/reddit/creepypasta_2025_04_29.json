    "selftext": "Hi, Pasta Aficionados!\n\nLet's talk about r\/EyeScream...\n\nAfter a lot of thought and deliberation, we here at r\/Creepypasta have decided to try something new and shake things up a bit.\n\nWe've had a long-standing issue of wanting to focus primarily on what \"Creepypasta\" originally was... namely, horror stories... but we didn't want to shut out any fans and tell them they couldn't post their favorite things here. We've been largely hands-off, letting people decide with upvotes and downvotes as opposed to micro-managing.\n\nAdditionally, we didn't want to send users to subreddits owned and run by other teams because - to be honest - we can't vouch for others, and whether or not they would treat users well and allow you guys to post all the things you post here. (In other words, we don't always agree with the strictness or tone of some other subreddits, and didn't want to make you guys go to those, instead.)\n\nTo that end, we've come up with a solution of sorts.\n\nWe started r\/IconPasta long ago, for fandom-related posts about Jeff the Killer, BEN, Ticci Toby, and the rest.\n\nWe started r\/HorrorNarrations as well, for narrators to have a specific place that was \"just for them\" without being drowned out by a thousand other types of posts.\n\nSo, now, we're announcing r\/EyeScream for creepy, disturbing, and just plain \"weird\" images!\n\nAt r\/EyeScream, you can count on us to be just as hands-off, only interfering with posts when they break Reddit ToS or our very light rules. (No Gore, No Porn, etc.)\n\nWe hope you guys have fun being the first users there - this is your opportunity to help build and influence what r\/EyeScream is, and will become, for years to come!"

    "selftext": "They say if you go through something traumatic as a kid, your brain kind of\u2026 protects you. Like it hides things from you until it thinks you\u2019re old enough to deal with them. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening to me, but it\u2019s the only way I can explain it.\n\nThings have been coming back. Not all at once, and not clearly\u2014just flashes. Feelings. Sounds. One memory triggers another and suddenly something I haven\u2019t thought about in 20 plus years feels like it just happened yesterday.\n\nAnyway. I\u2019ve never posted anything like this before and I probably wouldn\u2019t now, except\u2026 I need to get it out. I need to see it written down. I need to know I\u2019m not imagining all of this.\n\nI\u2019m posting this from a friend\u2019s Reddit account. I can\u2019t use mine. Last time I even hinted at any of this online, some people came after me. Like\u2014actual threats. Emails, weird messages, someone even sent a photo of my house. It scared the shit out of me and I deleted everything.\n\nBut I can\u2019t keep this inside anymore. So\u2026 here goes.\n\nI won\u2019t use my name, but I will use hers: Charlotte E. You might think me wrong to do so, but when I explain what she did to me in 1998, you might feel differently.\n\nThe 90s were a brutal time to be a kid. Bullying wasn\u2019t just common\u2014it was practically a rite of passage. Teachers often turned a blind eye, and schools rarely intervened unless someone ended up in the hospital.\n\nI remember reading about Kelly Yeomans in 1997\u2014a 13-year-old girl from Derby, England, who took her own life after relentless bullying. Her parents had complained to the school multiple times, but nothing changed. Kids would gather outside her house, throwing food and shouting insults. Eventually, she overdosed on painkillers.  \n\nThen there was Reena Virk in Canada. In 1997, she was just 14 when a group of teenagers beat her and left her to drown. She\u2019d been bullied for years, targeted for her weight and background. Her death became a national tragedy. \n\nI bring this up because I want you to understand the environment we were in. Bullying wasn\u2019t just overlooked\u2014it was ingrained in the culture. And Charlotte? She thrived in it.\n\nOne day in 1998, I saw a piece of paper being passed around the classroom.\nIt started at the back row and made its way forward, kids giggling, heads bent low like they were sharing some inside joke.\n\nA girl I was friendly with\u2014her name was Rose\u2014caught my eye. She looked sheepish, guilty. She mouthed something like sorry as it reached my desk.\n\nI didn\u2019t wait. I snatched the paper out of her hands before she could say anything else.\n\nIt was a poll.\n\nIn block letters at the top it said:\n\n\u201cShould [my name] kill herself?\u201d\n\nUnderneath, two columns.\nYes.\nNo.\n\nI counted.\nFourteen tallies under \u201cYes.\u201d\nNone under \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nEnd of part 1.\nI need to take a break here.\nI promise when I continue the supernaturally horrific parts of my story will come to life.\nI posted this to no sleep but was removed for what reason I don\u2019t know\u2026 they told me to post it to a more appropriate community so I\u2019m putting it here.

Ugh...Guess I need to take a break. So, I walk to the living room, sit on the couch, turn the TV on and start to browse channels, especially the cartoon ones because those Hindi dramas...aren't my cup of coffee. Suddenly I stumble into animax. What? I thought that channel was closed long ago. I guess they bought it back... So, I shake it off and start to watch it. Okay, just an random anime going on... I keep watching it. Then suddenly, with a glitch... I see that the next show is My Hero Academia OVA. Wait...why does the design looks like a fanmade...The OVA name...\"My Hero Academia: A Burned Dream\"? What kind of name is this?! Then suddenly the music is not really like the usual openings. It keeps changing the tempo in an ominous way. It doesn't sound normal at all... \n\nAfter that off-tuned opening, I see Midoriya studying in the night, exactly like how I'm studying and\u2014 wait...why does this look like my room? It's not exactly the same,but the setup looks like mine. Then suddenly, he hears the rustle. I feel like the rustle is coming from my room. The screen is glitching as he's coming closer to the wardrobe. He sees a hoodie that he doesn't remember belonging. Then suddenly, he hears the whispers. Midoriya. I also can feel the whisper through my ears. I turn back and see nothing. Then I turn my head to the TV. He's back to study again. Then suddenly, the scene shifts into the school. Aizawa ses him. Aizawa's inner monologue is like \"why does he look familiar?\" Then he remembers the incident when Endeavor was the teacher instead of Aizawa. Aizawa was new back then. Endeavor happened to burn the training arena and apparently half of the students were taken away. Iida, Tsuyu, Sero, Shoji, Aoyama, Tokoyami, Satou, Hagakure and...Midoriya. He's shocked. Wait, how is Midoriya alive? \n\nThe scene cuts and shows him just wandering. Suddenly he stops by the old storage, which is so forgotten by everyone. Then his eyes go on a mirror. In the mirror, however, he saw nothing but a version of himself...his skin burned. His eyes are still determined, but it's saddened. It says, \"I couldn't save anyone, Izuku. I couldn't, I couldn't fulfill my dream.\" Midoriya gets scared.\n\n\"who are you? What are you doing here?\" \n\n\"I am you, from the other universe. Back then, when Endeavor was the teacher, he accidentally burned the training arena and half of us died. I-I could not save anyone.\" \n\nIt starts crying. I swear I clench my heart. Tears fall from my eyes. I want to hug Midoriya. \n\n\"You are living my dream.\" \n\nAnd then the scene ends. \n\nFull black. \n\nI don't know what actually happened to Midoriya.\n\nThen after a few seconds , the credit rolls. No music. Just texts scrolling up. Then I notice something weird...all the writings are in japanese...one is only in English...it says \n\n\"\u00a9bones at 2010\"\n\nWait...not even MHA manga started back then! Suddenly the room's lights are flickering. I just rush into my sister's room to wake her up \n\n\"Sis, did you see something? Did you feel something\"\n\n \"No,I didn't feel anything. Don't scare me like that. You know that I'm scared of this kind of stuff\" as she rubs her eyes.\n\n\"I'm sorry\"\n\n28 January 2025\n\n4:00 PM\n\nIt's been a month and I still can't figure out what happened that day. \nI tell one of my junior who likes anime, about the channel as I can't find it anymore.\n\n\"It never came back.\""

The creature thing bit down on the mans lower jaw and placed it's top \"teeth\" on the mans bottom teeth (teeth is in quotation because they weren't exactly teeth if I remember correctly). During this, the man can't move, but once it was over, he then immediately brushed is teeth and used mouthwash, then after a few days, his teeth fell out and \"teeth\" similar to the thing's started coming in.  \nThat's all of the story that I remember, if anyone knows what I'm talking about and can help, that would be appreciated.

    "selftext": "What I\u2019m about to tell you may sound ridiculous, insane, and a whole other list of adjectives I don\u2019t care to write out now. I know what I saw and unfortunately the memory of it will scar me forever. For you to understand the true horror I experienced you must first understand the sequence of events that took place. \n\nAll day today I unloaded 30 bags of premium black mulch from a RAM 1500 and brought them into my mother\u2019s back yard for a landscaping project she insisted I complete.\nI raked repeatedly until 20 bags of the mulch covered a small area of her backyard; the once plain area was transformed into the perfect area to keep a dog house for our 2 dogs: Faye & Daisy. \n\nThe sun was beaming down harder today than it had in recent weeks as the Alabama weather refused to settle on one season. Sweat soaked my pants and shirt while beading down my legs before dripping into my mulch covered socks. Mulch was in my shoes; the small and spiky invaders stabbing my feet relentlessly until removed. Dust from the absorbent substance coated my hands and suffocated my pores. \n\nAfter finishing the task my mother bestowed upon me, I quickly retired to the shower to scrub even the tiniest trace of residue from my body. I donned my night time attire and went about my normal routine.\n\nI climbed into bed exhausted from a long day of physical labor hoping to settle easily into a good night\u2019s rest. Sleep did come easily but it did not stay with me for long. My eyes fluttered open slowly as I sucked down a big glob of drool that had begun making its way down my cheek and onto my pillow case. \n\n\u201cWha- what time is it?\u201d I mumbled groggily. I rolled over to check my phone and the time read 2:37 AM. I stared confusedly as I wondered why I had awoken so soon as my alarm wasn\u2019t set until 7:00 AM. I placed my phone back on my night stand and closed my eyes; hoping to hastily return to my treasured slumber. \n\nI lay still in my bed for only a moment before I heard a stirring in the kitchen. I jumped out of bed, grabbed my baseball bat that lay beside my nightstand, and rushed into my living room. I hastily flicked the light on to discover my back door open. I could partially see into my kitchen so I knew the culprit must be lingering beyond my line of sight or may have already made its way into my garage. I crept around the corner of my refrigerator and the kitchen was empty. So, the thief, or whatever this stranger was, must be hiding in my garage. I flicked the light on and meticulously checked every area the intruder could\u2019ve been hiding in. No one was there. \n\nAfter looking around more carefully in the kitchen and living room I couldn\u2019t find evidence that anything had been disturbed. The only thing that was out of place were a few disarrayed pieces of the premium black mulch I\u2019d spent my day putting into perfect order for my mother and our dogs. I chuckled to myself at my previous reaction and shook my head as I realized I probably just forgot to push the door all the way shut earlier. The wind must\u2019ve blown the door open which in turn produced the sound I heard. \n\nI scooped the pieces of mulch into my hand and opened the back door to haphazardly dump them into my backyard. As I stepped out onto my porch, the night air chilled me a little as the heat of the day had already vanished. I shivered a little and thought that I had better make this quick. I dumped the mulch and spun around to head back in doors when I heard a sound I\u2019ll never forget for as long as I live\u2026\n\nI wheeled around to see something so out there that I haven\u2019t gotten a single person to believe me thus far. Standing about 4 feet away from me was what I can only describe to you as: The Mulch Man. My thoughts and feelings raced hurriedly, ranging from initial confusion to complete and utter panic. A bag of black premium mulch was set atop 2 thick branches that looked like they\u2019d been broken off a nearby tree. It also appeared like whoever constructed this monstrosity in my yard had taken the time to don their creation with 2 more branches for \u201carms.\u201d A jagged mouth had been cut into the middle of the mulch bag as if the person intending to terrify me wanted me to see its evil grin. \n\nI angrily shouted into the night \u201cYou\u2019d better leave me alone now before I call the police!\u201d I listened for about 5 minutes before I decided this was probably some stupid prank by one of the neighbor\u2019s kids that must\u2019ve seen me taking the mulch earlier in the day. I turned around again to head back inside and catch some more beauty rest while the night was still young. \n\nI heard it again. I turned around and the mulch sculpture had moved closer to me. I cocked my head, studying it for a moment before nervous laughter erupted from my throat. I was just tired from the day before and really needed to get some rest. \n\nI was on my stomach before I knew it being pinned down by an incredibly strong being. I thrashed and kicked at first but stopped when I realized my efforts were futile. I lay still and waited for my attacker to tell me they wanted money or some other sick and twisted thing from me before they\u2019d leave me alone but it didn\u2019t come. \n\nWhat happened next shook me to my core. A piece of mulch fell onto my head before toppling to the concrete below me. I tried to turn my head but as I did more and more mulch began to rain down on top of me. I began struggling again to shake the mulch from my face and so I could scream at my attacker to stop. I turned white as a ghost when I realized the thing crushing me to the floor was no human opponent but instead the very Mulch Man I had thought was moving earlier. \n\nI began to cry as I realized that I would meet my end by an unknown cryptid and no one would ever know what truly became of me. Just as I accepted my fate, my mother burst through the back door and fired off a round from her shot gun into the mouth of the beast. I couldn\u2019t believe my mother had returned home just in time from a work convention she had flown to in London.  \n\nThe Mulch Man fell to the ground shrieking in agony before returning to a normal heap of premium black mulch and shredded plastic. My mother hurriedly embraced me in her arms and apologized for ever putting me in harms way. I forgave my mother easily. I still had to attend therapy for a long time after what happened because no one would believe me about what happened to me on that night. \n\nI still don\u2019t know how The Mulch Man came about. I don\u2019t know if someone broke into my backyard and put some weird ritualistic curse on a leftover bag of mulch. I\u2019m hesitant to say that The Mulch Man has just always existed and comes to haunt people that hate the chore that is yard work. \n\nPlease, if any of you have heard of or seen The Mulch Man then I need your advice on where to go from here!"

    "selftext": "It was an ordinary night. The wind was calm, and the noise of the city seemed to disappear. I was home, alone, as usual on Saturday nights. The television was on, but I wasn't paying attention to anything in particular; I was just passing the time, like anyone else would.\n\n\n\nThere was something strange about that night, something I couldn't quite put my finger on. It wasn't a specific sound, but a feeling. A feeling that something wasn't right. Something was just... off. I tried to ignore it, but I couldn't.\n\n\n\nI got up from the couch and walked over to the window. The sky was clear, cloudless, and the street was deserted. Nothing major, but still, there was something nagging at my mind. Something I couldn't shake.\n\n\n\nI went back to the couch and turned on the radio, trying to relax. Soft music started playing, but as the sound spread throughout the room, I noticed something that made me freeze.\n\n\n\nThe music wasn't just coming from the radio... It seemed to be coming from somewhere behind me.\n\n\n\nI quickly looked back, but there was nothing. The room was empty, except for the soft light of the lamp above me. The feeling of discomfort intensified. Something was there, and I couldn't see what it was.\n\n\n\n\"It's just my mind playing tricks,\" I thought. \"It's okay.\"\n\n\n\nThat's when I heard the first whisper.\n\n\n\nIt was low, almost inaudible, but something was clearly saying my name. \"Elios...\" the voice called, softly, as if it were in a dark corner of the room, right behind me.\n\n\n\nMy heart started beating faster. I turned around slowly, trying to locate the source of the voice, but there was no one. The room was empty, except for me and the feeling that something was approaching.\n\n\n\nI grabbed my cell phone and started looking for distractions. Discord, social media, anything to take me away from those strange feelings. When I looked at the clock on the wall, I realized that time seemed to have stopped. It was already 11:30 p.m., but it felt like I had entered a strange state of suspension. My hands were cold.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, a light flickered in a corner of the room, near the window. I quickly went over to it, but when I looked outside, I saw something even stranger. In the reflection of the window, I saw a shadow, a dark figure that shouldn't have been there. It was standing still, staring straight at me.\n\n\n\nMy breathing became heavy, and on impulse, I ran to the door of the room to close it. But when I touched the handle, I felt something cold, like an invisible hand, grabbing my wrist.\n\n\n\n\"No... I can't leave.\"\n\n\n\nThe voice was clearer now. It was a low whisper, but now, it seemed to come from everywhere at once. \"You're never going to leave again.\"\n\n\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to stay calm. \"This can't be happening,\" I thought. But when I looked to the side, I saw eyes glowing in the darkness. They weren't human eyes. They were large, black, and they moved around the room, as if they were watching my every move.\n\n\n\nThe creature was getting closer, and I couldn\u2019t run anymore. There was nowhere to run. It was there, but I couldn\u2019t really see it. I could only feel its presence. The air was heavy, as if I were breathing water.\n\n\n\nThe room seemed to shrink around me, and the feeling of suffocation grew stronger. My mind was in a state of total panic, and the lights began to flicker violently. The sound of the radio, which had been soft before, now turned into loud static, as if it was about to explode in some kind of distortion.\n\n\n\nIt was then that I heard it again. The voice. But it was no longer a whisper. It was clear, strong, and the phrase it was saying was now burning into my mind.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou will never leave here. You are with me now.\u201d\n\n\n\nFear took hold of me in such an intense way that I could barely move anymore. I was trapped in the room, but not physically. I was trapped in the mind of what was watching me. The room began to spin and distort. The walls twisted, and shadows seemed to dance in the dim light of the lamp.\n\n\n\nI no longer knew what was real.\n\n\n\nAnd then, the door I thought had closed opened of its own accord. The room was cold, icy, and I knew something was waiting on the other side. Something that shouldn't be there.\n\n\n\nI could no longer see the light. Everything around me became pitch black. I didn't know what was happening, but I was no longer alone. Something had taken me, and now I was lost, with no chance of escape.\n\n\n\nThe radio went silent.\n\n\n\nAnd all that was left was silence."

    "selftext": "If you\u2019re reading this, then either you\u2019re thinking about moving to Oar\u2019s Rest, or you\u2019ve already made the mistake and landed here.\n\nEither way: listen closely. I\u2019m not writing this for fun. I\u2019m not writing this to scare you off, either. I\u2019m writing it because if you don\u2019t know the rules, you\u2019re going to die.\n\nOar\u2019s Rest is a small harbor town wedged against the Pacific, on the kind of jagged coastline where the cliffs are always crumbling, the waves are always angry, and the mist never really goes away.\nThere\u2019s a reason we don\u2019t have many tourists. There\u2019s a reason none of the locals ever swim past the third buoy.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason we still survive at all.\n\nHer name is the Guardian.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s what most of us call her. Some of the older fishermen call her \u201cThe Black Siren.\u201d Some of the women from the Outer Cliffs call her \u201cMother Beneath.\u201d\nI even heard one drunk asshole call her \u201cGod\u2019s Last Dog\u201d once.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t matter what you call her. She\u2019s the same thing.\n\nAnd if you fuck with her, she will fuck with you back.\n\nNobody survives the Guardian\u2019s anger. Nobody.\n\nThat being said, she\u2019s not exactly evil.\nWithout her, we\u2019d all be dead a dozen times over. She guards this harbor from things that make her look tame.\n\nYou\u2019ll see. If you stay long enough, you\u2019ll see.\n\nThat being said, here are the rules you need to follow if you want to survive your stay here:\n\n\u2e3b\n\nRule 1: Never, ever call out across the water after dark.\n\nThe ocean is not empty at night. If you shout your friend\u2019s name, the thing that calls back might sound just like them\u2014but it won\u2019t be.\nIf you hear your name whispered from the water after midnight, ignore it. Don\u2019t answer. Don\u2019t even look.\n\nThe Guardian will usually keep those things away from the docks, but if you invite them closer, you\u2019re on your own.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nRule 2: Stay behind the third buoy.\n\nYou\u2019ll see them floating out there, big ugly orange things bobbing in a lazy line. They\u2019re the boundary.\nThey aren\u2019t there for your safety from boats or currents. They\u2019re there to mark the end of the Guardian\u2019s territory.\n\nPast that line, you\u2019re prey.\n\nNot even she can save you if you\u2019re dumb enough to go beyond.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nRule 3: Never harm a sea creature inside the harbor.\n\nFish, crabs, even the ugly barnacle things that cling to the pilings\u2014don\u2019t mess with them. If you catch something, treat it with respect. If you see a stranded jellyfish, put it back.\n\nOne time, a teenager speared an octopus for fun in the shallows. Everyone found his kayak floating upside down the next morning, gutted like a fish.\nNo body. No blood trail. Just the kayak\u2026 and the claw marks inside it.\n\nWe all knew who did it. No one blamed her.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nRule 4: If you see the Guardian, mind your business.\n\nShe\u2019s not pretty in the way you\u2019d think.\nTall, slender\u2014almost stretched too thin to be real. Smooth black and grey skin that doesn\u2019t catch the light.\nQuills down her spine like a hellish porcupine. No eyes. No nose. Just that mouth\u2014a wide, splitting thing with a double lower jaw that looks like it could shear your arm clean off.\n\nSometimes you\u2019ll see the glowing tips of her antennae hovering above the water, like two fireflies floating in the mist.\n\nIf you see her: look down. Mind your business. Pretend you never saw anything at all.\n\nThe Guardian doesn\u2019t like being stared at.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nRule 5: Pay attention to the mist.\n\nMost mornings, Oar\u2019s Rest wakes up blanketed in thick, cold fog. That\u2019s normal. But if the mist turns blue\u2014even a little\u2014get indoors and lock your doors.\n\nThat means she\u2019s fighting something out there. Something bad enough that even she can\u2019t keep it entirely hidden.\n\nIf you stay outside, you\u2019re fair game.\nShe\u2019ll kill whatever she\u2019s fighting\u2014and she\u2019ll kill you too, if you\u2019re in the way.\n\nCollateral damage.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nRule 6: If you hurt her, she will not forgive.\n\nI don\u2019t care if it was an accident. I don\u2019t care if you \u201cdidn\u2019t know.\u201d I don\u2019t even care if you survive the first night after.\n\nYou lay a hand on her, or even try to\u2014\nYou are a dead man walking.\n\nIt might take hours. It might take days.\nBut when you least expect it, you\u2019ll hear a scraping at your door\u2026\n\u2026and you won\u2019t see morning.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nI guess you might be wondering: why do we even stay?\n\nWhy not just leave?\n\nThe thing is\u2026 we have left, before. Once. Back in \u201978.\n\nThey called it \u201cThe Empty Summer.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian disappeared for three straight months. No sightings. No blue mist. Nothing.\nWe thought maybe we were free. Maybe we could open up the harbor, start bringing in tourists, build a real town.\n\nIn those three months, thirty-seven people disappeared.\n\nThey didn\u2019t just vanish, either.\nWe found bones. We found hands. We found things that looked like shark bites, but the teeth marks were too wide, too deep.\n\nWe found a boat washed up on the rocks with something still alive tangled in the nets\u2014a thing that screamed like a child and bit through solid iron.\n\nThe Guardian came back after the third full moon.\nAnd everything else\u2026 went quiet.\n\nWe don\u2019t take her for granted anymore."

The things that go through my reflections minds is not healthy, it even poisons me a little bit. I try not to look at mirrors anymore because I dare not read the mind of my reflection. Sometimes I just do it out of curiosity and when I have nothing else to do. When I looked at the mirror and saw my reflection, I could read my reflections minds. More like hearing its thoughts and desires. It was truly captivating and worrying at the same time. \n\nI kept hearing my reflections minds going on about keeping warm inside the oven, but it wasn't scared of being burned alive. The reason why my reflection wasn't worried about being cooked inside the oven, was because it will take another person with it inside the oven. So while my reflection would enjoy being inside the oven, the other person will be taking the punishment of being cooked. My reflections mind kept going on about wanting to be inside the oven and it was obsessed with the oven. I then had to cover up the mirror. \n\nReading anyone's mind can be quite harrowing. I guess there are some things that no one should know. Then when I wanted to look in the mirror again to hear the thoughts of my reflections mind, it started to say how it wanted to operate on animals and make them look as close to human as possible. My reflections kept on about how it could make a cat look as human as possible and even dogs. People will simply think that there are people acting like animals, when in fact they are actually animals that had been heavily operated on to look as human as much as possible. \n\nMy reflections mind kept pondering animal to operate on, to make it look human. I couldn't look at the mirror anymore as I couldn't take anymore from my reflections minds. I don't know why my reflection has such a weird mind and why these kinds of thoughts go through its mind. Then I couldn't help but look at the mirror again, as soon as I saw my reflection I could hear its thoughts again. It was just screams and pure hatred filth. The mind didn't make sense but then it started to think about operating on animals, to make them look human. \n\nI couldn't hear anymore from my reflections mind, then I saw a small man in my living room who was moving like a cat......"

Neighbors first, then classmates, and eventually brothers in everything but blood.\n\nStephen was the dreamer among us. Obsessed with time travel \u2014 talking about it, studying it, believing someday he could bend the flow of time. Kevin and I used to laugh it off, thinking it was just another one of his weird phases.\n\nUntil one night, Stephen called us over.\nHe had built it.\nA real time machine.\n\nWe didn't believe him, not until we watched a banana disappear into thin air after he punched in a random date \u2014 March 11, 1964. It was insane. Terrifying. The machine worked.\n\nStephen warned us it was unstable, not ready for human use. Kevin nodded along, smiling like always. I thought he was just amazed like I was.\n\nThat night, Kevin called me at 1 AM.\n\nHis voice was hollow, broken. He said he was going to use the machine to kill his younger self \u2014 an easy way out without leaving a mess behind. I thought he was just drunk or tired. I told him to sleep it off.

    "selftext": "I am alive. I am the former contents of a cocoon. I am the worm on the dusk\u2018s wet sidewalk. I am the cotton ready to harvest. I am the harm in a child\u2019s cough. I am alive, in every way I have come to be and, in every way, I\u2018ll continue to be. Lightning struck the ground, and crawling back towards the sky, decided the way it will be experienced. In a bright flash and gone, so insanely complicated. Impossible to capture in life or mind. Where I am now is not my fault, my past is a symptom of it. Where I will be never was and never will be up to me. I am only now regardless.\r\n\r\nI now sustain myself on the miniscule meat of the crawdad. Crawdad is best eaten boiled. Rip it out of the water it finds comfort in and throw it into your own water, hot. I can\u2018t stand it, I sweat more than I drink. Flavor it in any way, it doesn\u2019t mind. After it\u2018s been stripped of life and its natural flavor, rip it in half by the tail. Discard the guts and remove the meat from the tail. Then remove its digestive tract regardless of whether it ate anything recently. If it got a lot of work, it\u2019ll have big claws. Its claws have little thumbs. If you pull on them just right, the best meat is inside there. Because they earned it. They deserve It and so do I.\r\n\r\nThe fruits of the crawdad\u2018s labor was for me. The fruits of my labor are for no one. I only had my first break yesterday. I spent my day screaming and running. I also spent it smiling. I spent it on myself and now my savings are gone. I am out of time. For 2 months I have been a slave to avoidance and a victim of fear. I have feared the call of man. And I am the representative of man in this valley. I have given nothing to the office. Every day I do nothing more than sustain and hide. I have pretended that what I have needed to do this entire time was what I had to fear, but I get it now. I am ready whether it be my choice or not.\r\n\r\nMy best day, yesterday, was completed only within a hundred feet of myself. I only saw that far. A haboob tore through the valley. I woke up to the wind scratching my home, rather than brushing it soft as usual. Dust was obscuring my town. This could have been my only opportunity to give it my all. That unhappy bastard couldn\u2018t see me or hear me. I couldn\u2019t see or hear him. We were separated for the first time. I turned on every light in my home. I knocked on every front door on my street. I screamed and I screamed, but never a word. I was sick of talking to myself, so I let my screams be indeterminate. \r\n\r\nI walked my former route to the gas station, still calling out to nothing. My routine was being reclaimed. I met every house and building on the way, they introduced themselves one by one. Visiting me through the dust and then fading away behind me. Everything was temporary and my world became so very small. I was only a block away from the station when I felt it. I did not hear it but I felt it. That crippling vibration. I stopped screaming. It happened again, more intensely. It wasn\u2018t me. I didn\u2019t cause this. I couldn\u2018t have. He couldn\u2019t hear me. I was free. I was dead in my tracks, alive in my breath.\r\n\r\nThe wind grew more exponentially more intense, growing in pressure until I witnessed the tower of callous skin cells crash down to my side and onto the next home. The sudden gust of wind blew me over the street into the neighbor\u2018s yard and rolled me across the dirt in a somersault that culminated in my right heel penetrating a plastic fence and my left arm under my back. I nearly tore my Achilles tendon on the fence and instantly broke my left humerus. I fought for my breath to return to my lungs for a moment before the foot of the giant lifted back up and my body was thrust back onto the road by the wind fighting to return to the sudden vacuum left behind. Rolling on the asphalt, it shredded my back with stripes after taking all the skin from my knees.\r\n\r\nI spent a while on my stomach. The only thing that hurt worse than the dust coating the wounds on my back was the weight of my torso forcing the sharp rocks of Thatcher asphalt into my back side. I eventually got up and limped home. If it was still there, I\u2018d like the privilege of dying in my own bed. Stumbling onto my lawn to see it still there. I collapsed onto what used to be fresh and comfortable grass and is now coarse desert dirt with a thin film of the dust of todays false freedom. I woke up the next day to a sunburn on the back of my neck. \r\n\r\nI lifted my head through pain\u2018s realization to a noonday sun. I couldn\u2019t crawl on my knees so I had no choice to stand. Inside of my home was every light still on. I prayed that the dust had just cleared within the day, and my home hadn\u2018t been a beacon through the night. It had to have been true. I was still alive, my home was still there. Surely he would have finally killed me if he saw. I winced through a climb of my straight ladder to my roof to peek over. H e was not there across the valley. The pain of my entire body traveled to my heart. My wounds bled harder as my heart beat faster. He wasn\u2019t to the east or west. \u201cHe left.\u201d I spoke. \u201cHe finally left!\u201d I cheered.\r\n\r\nI started to raise myself up to stand. In the process, I stopped for a sit and turned around to match the angle of the roof. I sat there admiring the wide base of Mount Graham through squinted eyes. I scanned up to the peak of Mount Graham where I made my first eye contact in 2 months. Creeping over the top of the mountain were a scalp of scabs miles long and 2 eyes open wide, locked onto my home.\r\n"

    "selftext": "Me and my friends were exploring this abandoned building once and it was crazier than we thought. \n\nSo me and my three friends, let\u2019s call them Joe, Bud and Reagan. We were bored on the last day of summer and wanted something exciting to do. Bud said \u201c how about we go explore something?\u201d At first we didn\u2019t really want to do that. It felt too boring. All the abandoned buildings around our town were already explored or demolished but Bud told us about a new abandoned building. One that any of us had ever heard about. We hadn\u2019t even seen the building even though almost all of us had lived in that town for 18 years. Except for Reagan, he moved in a couple of years back.\n\n\nOnce Bud told us about a house that we had never heard of. All of us got very excited. All the other abandoned buildings were lame but this one sounded very thrilling. \u201cThe building is said to be an old psych ward,\u201d Bud said. That got us even more excited. \u201cHow old is it?\u201d I asked. \u201c I don\u2019t really know.\u201d Bud said. \u201cAll I know is that it\u2019s abandoned and supposed to be very scary and there may even be traps\u201d Bud added. \u201cWow\u201d we all said in unison. The traps made it more exciting for us because we were young and thought it\u2019s like a video game. We got outside, hopped on our bikes and took off.\n\nWe stopped by a store and got some snacks and energy drinks to enjoy, while we were inside the building. Then it was time to go. We went into a forest nearby. Bud was the only one who knew where this place was. That made me a little bit suspicious about this whole thing. That and the fact that this was supposed to be an abandoned psych ward that none of us knew about. We walked on this path through a dense forest. The path was old and no one had been there in ages. Or so we thought. It was dark even though it was during the day because the forest was that dense.\n\n\nThen I started to see light coming through the thick leaves and branches and a building. \u201cPretty small\u201d I thought. The building was quite small, about the size of a 2 story house. It looked small because I imagined a psych ward to be huge. It looked abandoned but not completely worn off by the weather. The windows had bars on them and the paint was in pretty good shape. Few cracks here and there but nothing big. Surprisingly it did not have any fence or gate surrounding it, just the building in the middle of the woods. \u201cHow the hell have we not heard about this?\u201d Joe said. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d I answered in disbelief. We walked up to the front door. It looked almost normal but it too had bars on its windows. We tried the handle. \u201cClick\u201d The door unlocked and we opened it.\n\nAs we got inside everything looked brand new. Walls were painted a light blue color and the floor was made from wood. All in darn good shape for an abandoned building. Everyone was pretty anxious about the whole thing, I could feel it. \u201cHow long has this even been abandoned?\u201d I asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know but it doesn\u2019t look abandoned\u201d Bud said with this horrified look on his face. He looked like he didn\u2019t have any clue about this place and from how he talked earlier it seemed like he had been inside this building before. \u201cSo you have never been here?\u201d I asked with a small bit of anger in my voice. \u201cNope,\u201d he told us. Now we all were scared as hell. I sensed that in each one of us.  We were all scared and wanted to get out but our egos didn\u2019t allow it and we continued exploring.\n\nWe went into a room. It had a sofa in it and a couple of chairs with restraints on it. \u201cWow this actually is abandoned and old,\u201d Reagan said. \u201cThese types of chairs are not used anymore,\u201d He added.  Apparently he was really into abandoned hospitals and psych wards and had been researching them alot.  Then we heard a ghostly voice whisper  \u201cget out\u201d. \u201cWhat the fuck\u201d Joe said loudly. Then we heard a door slam shut and footsteps followed by what seemed to be chains rattling or someone walking with chains on their body. We looked behind us and the door to the room was closed. \u201cdid that door just slam shut?\u201d I stuttered. I was terrified and almost had a panic attack. \u201c I think it did\u201d Reagan said also stuttering. \u201cWe need to get out!\u201d Bud yelled. \n\nSo we did. Joe went first and opened the door slowly. We heard nothing. We stepped back in to the lobby. We heard a whisper \u201csssss\u201d but I couldn\u2019t hear what it said. Then we heard the chain rattle again. It sounded like it was coming closer and it was. Every second that passed that sound came closer and closer.\n\nWe started walking towards the exit. We wanted to get out of there.  I tried to open the front door but it didn\u2019t open. \u201cWhat?\u201d I thought. We just came in from that door maybe 20 minutes ago. \u201cIt\u2019s locked,\u201d I said, visibly shaking. \u201cWe have to find another way out,\u201d said Joe. He didn\u2019t seem scared at all. That calmed me down too because what could happen to us, right?\n\nWe started to walk inside the building looking for a way out. The rattling was gone. Weird. Then all of a sudden we heard another slam sound. I looked behind us and I can still see that picture in my head. \n\nThere it was, Bud. Laying on the floor. Not moving nor breathing. I checked his pulse and he was dead. He had a plank attached to his head with lots of blood on the floor. \u201cWhat the fuck\u201d I yelled and we started running towards the exit. I was so scared that I almost couldn\u2019t run. We made it to the exit and opened the door. \u201cHow the fuck is it unlocked?\u201d Reagan yelled. And he started to cry as well. Then we started to run away from there so fast that we even forgot our bikes.\n\nI glanced back at the building and I saw lights on in one room and a weird figure just waving at us. We stopped to catch our breath and I called the police. We waited for what felt like at least two hours but in reality it was maybe 20 minutes. The cops arrived and we explained what happened. They went in and came out maybe 10 minutes later. They said that Bud was really dead but the house was also empty. We were all shocked and started to cry a little. Or at least me and Reagan did. Joe was calm, too calm. It was bizarre. Our friend just died and all because we entered that abandoned ward. I never thought that this would be the last time I\u2019m going to see Bud.\n\n"

    "selftext": "\"They say not every shadow clone disappears when it's supposed to..\"\n\nIt was during a brutal battle deep in the forests near the Hidden Mist Village, when Naruto, exhausted but desperate, unleashed a mass of shadow clones. In the chaos, with jutsu and steel flashing around him, he never noticed \u2014 one of them\u2026 didn't vanish.\n\nThis clone, unlike the others, hesitated after taking a lethal blow. But instead of evaporating into a puff of smoke like the rest, something twisted inside it \u2014 a spark of independent thought. Consciousness.\n\nIt blinked, confused, feeling the overwhelming heat of its own pulse, the hunger gnawing at its gut. It looked around the battlefield and realized something terrifying: it did not want to die.\n\nSilently, it slipped away, unnoticed even by Naruto himself, merging into the shadows of the dense forest.\n\n\nAt first, the clone tried to survive by simply hiding. But there was a problem \u2014 its body, being a construct of chakra and severed from the source, was unstable. Without constant replenishment, it began to wither, pieces of its existence fading like mist. The pain was unbearable.\n\nAnd that's when it discovered something disturbing: if it consumed the flesh of other shinobi, it could absorb their chakra.\n\nThe first kill was clumsy. A wandering Mist-nin, lost and wounded. The clone, still bearing Naruto\u2019s innocent face and bright blue eyes, approached the man with a trembling smile, pretending to offer help. When the man leaned on him, the clone dragged him into a hollowed tree trunk and tore into him like a wild beast.\n\nThe taste was addicting. The feeling of chakra pouring into its false body, knitting the instability back together, was better than anything it could have imagined.\n\nFrom then on, it became a predator, wearing Naruto's face like a mask. It would approach unsuspecting victims \u2014 sometimes with laughter, sometimes with concern \u2014 and lead them away, whispering:\n\n\"This way... it's safe here, \u2014dattebayo...\"\n\nOnly for the screams to be swallowed by the trees.\n\n\nWeeks passed. The clone grew stronger. Its features started warping slightly \u2014 teeth sharper, hair a shade darker, eyes flickering a red-orange hue when it lost control. It learned to hide these imperfections behind a cheerful smile, an almost flawless imitation of the real Naruto.\n\nBut deep inside, it no longer felt like a shadow or an extension. It believed it was Naruto.\nA better Naruto \u2014 one unbound by morals, by weakness, by ties to others.\n\nThere was only one thing left to do: eliminate the original.\n\n\nOne misty evening, Naruto found himself alone while scouting for rogue shinobi. The air was cold, too cold for the season, and a strange stillness hung over the woods.\n\nThen he heard it: the familiar chuckle.\n\n\"Yo! How are you my brother! Long time no see..,\" said a voice identical to his own.\n\nNaruto spun around, kunai drawn \u2014 and there it was: himself, standing a few feet away, grinning wildly. But something was wrong. The grin was too wide. The eyes too hungry. The chakra... twisted.\n\n\"Who the hell are you?\" Naruto barked, sensing the malevolence oozing off the figure.\n\nThe clone only laughed, a hoarse, grating sound. \"C'mon, don't be like that. I'm you... your missing alter ego..\"\n\nBefore Naruto could react, the clone lunged. Their clash lit up the forest in flashes of violent energy. But the clone fought dirty \u2014 biting, clawing, using forbidden jutsu Naruto had never even learned.\n\nIn between strikes, the clone hissed:\n\n\"I'll take your place... Nobody will even know you're gone. I'll be the hero. I'll be loved. And I'll never... EVER... be weak again!\"\n\nThe fight raged on for what felt like hours. Blood stained the earth. Trees shattered. Birds fled screaming.\n\nFinally, Naruto managed to pierce the clone's chest with a Rasengan, its body shuddering, cracking like broken glass. But before it dissolved, it whispered one last time:\n\n\"There are others... you made so many of us... you think I'm the only one who woke up?\"\n\nWith that, it shattered into mist, leaving Naruto alone, heart hammering in the silence.\n\n\nSince that night, Naruto never used the Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu again without a sense of unease gnawing at him. Maybe that's why the First Hokage declared it a forbidden jutsu.\nSometimes, in the dead of night, he swore he saw his own face grinning at him from the treeline.\nOther times, villagers would vanish \u2014 last seen smiling and walking with someone they trusted deeply. Someone... who looked just like Naruto.\n\nThey say shadows can never be trusted.\nAnd some of them... never truly leave.\n"

    "selftext": "I only accept apologies at 10:45pm and nothing to late or too early. It has to be at 10:45 pm and only then will people be able to apologise to me. It's the best to for apologies to happen and I don't like it when apologies either come to early or late. My country is at war and dead bodies are everywhere, everything is being rationed and destruction is rife. The will to survive is strong though and we all kept going. I am disciplined though and I mean it when I say that at 10:45 pm, is when I will accept apologies. \n\nSo when takar came to me and apologised to me at 10:46 pm I was furious. I had murderous thoughts and then I noticed that I am living in a war zone. Buildings have been bombed and collapsed, and so when I murdered takar for apologising to me at 10:46 pm instead of 10:45pm, I realised that a war zone is a perfect place for a murderer and serial killer. No one will even tell the difference whether someone had been killed through war, or from a murderer or serial killer. It's crazy how I am in the right environment. \n\nThen when eranica apologised to me at 10:44pm instead of 10:45 pm I was disgusted by her. There had been more bombs thrown down us before and that meant more fresh dead bodies. So when I murdered eranica for apologising to me at 10:44pm instead of 10:45 pm, I just put her body into the rubble and no one will be able to tell that she was murdered, they will simply think that she is a victim of war. \n\nThen I started to succumb to survivors guilt because I am so lucky to be born in a place, where there are so many people being killed and bodies all over the place. Imagine someone murdering someone in a place where it is peaceful and not a war zone, if i murdered someone in a non war zone place I would be struggling to not get caught. Luckily I live in a war zone place and dead bodies are a common sight. I have been so ungrateful to my situation where it makes it easier to murder. \n\nSo I decided to go to the mirror and say sorry to myself for being ungrateful. Then I realised that I said sorry to myself at 10:44 pm instead of 10:45pm. My reflection turned angry and came out of the mirror to try and kill me. I ran away and I am still running away. "

    "selftext": "My Dog Returned After Disappearing in the Woods. He Came Back...Different.\nI've been debating whether to post this for days now. Part of me thinks writing it all down might help me process what's happening, but another part is terrified that acknowledging it makes it more real. I need to know if anyone else has experienced anything like this. Please. I'm not trying to scare anyone. I genuinely need help understanding what's happening to my dog and to me.\n\nFor context, I live in a modest three-bedroom house at the edge of Millfield, backing up to Blackwood Forest. I moved here eight months ago after my relationship with Marcus ended. Five years together, engagement ring picked out, then I found the texts from his coworker. I needed somewhere quiet to rebuild myself, somewhere far from shared memories and mutual friends. Real estate was cheap here because of the \"Millfield Reputation,\" as the locals call it. Three disappearances in the past decade, all ultimately attributed to people getting lost in Blackwood's dense wilderness. The old-timers at the local coffee shop sometimes mention how the Native tribes avoided these woods long before settlers arrived. \"Bad medicine,\" they'd say with knowing glances. I never paid much attention to the folklore. I should have.\n\nIt's mostly quiet here except for the occasional hiker passing through to the trails. I've lived alone since the breakup. Just me and Cooper, my four-year-old chocolate Lab mix. The one good thing I took from that relationship.\n\nCooper has always been the perfect dog. Goofy, affectionate, and smart enough to know when I need space or comfort. He sleeps at the foot of my bed most nights, only moving when the heating kicks on and the floor vents become more appealing. We have our routine: morning walks through the neighborhood, evening walks along the forest edge. He's never shown aggression, never even barked at strangers without good reason.\n\nAt least, that was Cooper before.\n\nI first noticed something strange about the forest about a month before Cooper disappeared. We were on our evening walk when I spotted unusual markings on some of the trees near the trail. Not typical trail blazes or graffiti, but intricate symbols carved deep into the bark. They resembled nothing I recognized, though something about them felt strangely familiar, like words on the tip of your tongue that you can't quite recall. Cooper refused to go near those trees, pulling hard on his leash to give them a wide berth. I didn't think much of it then. Animals have better instincts than we do.\n\nIt happened nineteen days ago. We were on our evening walk along the trail that borders the forest when a group of deer startled ahead of us. Cooper has always been curious about wildlife, but never one to chase. We'd worked on that extensively when he was a puppy. But this time was different. Something about their sudden movement triggered something in him, and before I could tighten my grip on the leash, he yanked it from my hand and bolted after them into the woods.\n\nI called his name until my voice gave out. I searched until it was too dark to see, using my phone's flashlight to navigate the increasingly dense trees. The forest felt wrong that night. The typical ambient sounds of insects and nocturnal creatures had fallen silent, replaced by what I can only describe as a pulsing silence. A silence that felt alive, watchful. I had to give up when my battery died, promising myself I'd return at first light.\n\nThe next two weeks were hell. I put up flyers everywhere, called every shelter within fifty miles, and posted in every local Facebook group. I walked those woods every morning and every evening, expanding my search area each day. I left his favorite blanket and some food at the edge of the forest where he'd disappeared. I took time off work to search. I barely slept.\n\nOn day fifteen, Mrs. Abernathy, the elderly woman who lives two blocks over, called. She'd seen my posts and wanted to tell me she thought she'd seen Cooper near the old Wilkins property at the far edge of the woods, about four miles from where he'd disappeared.\n\nMrs. Abernathy has lived in Millfield her entire life. She's one of those small-town fixtures who knows everything about everyone. Her family had been here since the town's founding, and she often shared stories about Millfield's history. Not the sanitized version in the town brochures, but the dark stories passed down through generations. She was the first person who told me about the Wilkins farm when I moved here.\n\n\"The Wilkins place has a history,\" she told me over welcome cookies. \"Old man Wilkins was involved in some strange practices back in the 1920s. They say he brought books back from Europe after the Great War. Started holding meetings in that cellar of his. Then one winter, the entire family vanished. Seven people, gone without a trace. The authorities found... unusual things in that cellar. Nobody's lived there since.\"\n\nI'd dismissed it as small-town superstition then. Now her voice on the phone carried a weight that made me uneasy.\n\n\"Are you sure it was him?\" I asked, trying not to sound too desperate.\n\nThere was an odd pause before she answered. \"Well, it looked like your Cooper... mostly. But something was... off about the way he moved. Like he was being... puppeteered. Thought it was just my eyes playing tricks.\" Another pause. \"You be careful if you go looking out there, Alex. Some parts of those woods, they change people. Change animals too.\"\n\nI thanked her and immediately drove to the Wilkins property. An abandoned farmhouse that local teens used for parties sometimes. The place always gave me the creeps, but I'd have walked through hell itself to find Cooper.\n\nThe property was silent when I arrived, just before sunset. The main house stood decrepit, with boarded windows and peeling paint, surrounded by overgrown fields. As I approached, calling Cooper's name, I noticed the cellar doors were ajar. Just a sliver of darkness between them.\n\nI heard a faint whimper.\n\nHesitantly, I pulled the doors open. The hinges groaned in protest, and the smell hit me immediately. Damp earth, mold, and something metallic I couldn't place. Underneath it all was a sweetness, sickly and cloying, like fruit beginning to rot. I used my phone light to illuminate stone stairs descending into darkness.\n\n\"Cooper?\" I called, my voice echoing. Another whimper, definitely a dog, somewhere below.\n\nI still can't fully explain why I went down those stairs. Anyone who's seen a horror movie would know better. But it was Cooper, I was certain of it, and he sounded hurt.\n\nThe cellar was larger than I'd expected, with several rooms branching off a main area. Water dripped somewhere, and my light caught strange markings on the walls. Symbols I didn't recognize, but which sent a chill of recognition through me. They were similar to what I'd seen carved into those trees near my house, but more elaborate, more... complete. They almost seemed to shift when viewed from the corner of my eye, as if rearranging themselves when not directly observed. There were dark stains on the concrete floor that I tried not to think about too much. The air felt thick, almost resistant, as if the darkness itself had substance.\n\nI followed the sound of breathing to the farthest room. The temperature dropped noticeably as I approached, my breath fogging in front of me despite it being early September.\n\nAnd there was Cooper, huddled in the corner, staring at me with eyes that reflected my light too brightly.\n\n\"Cooper! Oh my God!\" I rushed to him, relief overwhelming my caution.\n\nHe didn't run to me like I expected. He stayed perfectly still, watching me approach. It was only when I was a few feet away that he slowly stood up. His fur was matted with mud. No, not mud, it was too dark, too thick. And he smelled wrong, like copper and something rotten underneath the earthy scent.\n\nBut it was definitely Cooper. Same white chest patch, same notch in his ear from a fence incident last year. When I knelt and held out my hand, he finally came to me, pressing his cold nose against my palm.\n\nI was so overwhelmed with relief that I overlooked the strangeness of finding him in that cellar, of the odd markings on the walls, of the way he kept his head tilted slightly too far to the right. I just wanted to get him home.\n\nThe vet couldn't find anything physically wrong with him the next day. She noted he was slightly underweight but otherwise healthy. No injuries, no signs of trauma. She did remark that he was \"unusually calm\" during the examination, which was unlike him. Cooper normally hated the vet.\n\nDr. Levine had been Cooper's vet since he was a puppy. She knew his typical behavior, which made her concerned expression all the more troubling.\n\n\"His vitals are normal, but his pupils are unusually dilated,\" she said, shining a light into Cooper's eyes. He didn't flinch or look away, just stared ahead. \"And his body temperature is lower than I'd expect. Has he been lethargic?\"\n\n\"Sort of,\" I replied. \"He's been quiet. Not really himself.\"\n\n\"He might be a bit traumatized from whatever happened,\" she suggested. \"Just give him time to readjust. Keep an eye on him, note any concerning behaviors. Call me immediately if anything changes.\" She hesitated, then added, \"You found him in the Wilkins place, right? That old cellar?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"My grandmother used to tell stories about that place,\" she said, her voice lower. \"Just... watch him closely, okay?\"\n\nIf only she'd been more specific about what \"concerning behaviors\" might look like.\n\nThe first few days, I was just happy to have him back. I attributed his quietness to stress. He wasn't eating much, but the vet said that might take time. He followed me everywhere but kept a strange distance. Always watching, rarely approaching for affection like he used to.\n\nI tried calling my friend Jenna, who'd helped me search for Cooper initially. She'd always been our go-to dog sitter and loved Cooper almost as much as I did. I thought maybe seeing a familiar face might help him readjust.\n\n\"He's acting weird,\" I told her over the phone. \"Not like himself at all. Would you mind coming over?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" she said. \"I'll bring those treats he loves.\"\n\nWhen she arrived that afternoon, Cooper's reaction was disturbing. He backed away, growling low in his throat at the sight of her. Jenna, confused and hurt, tried to approach him slowly.\n\n\"Hey buddy, it's just me,\" she cooed, reaching out.\n\nCooper's growl deepened, taking on that strange layered quality I would become familiar with in the coming days. Jenna froze.\n\n\"What was that sound?\" she whispered.\n\n\"I don't know,\" I admitted. \"He's been... different since he came back.\"\n\nShe stayed for only half an hour, visibly unsettled by Cooper's behavior. At the door, she pulled me aside.\n\n\"Alex, I don't want to scare you, but that doesn't seem like Cooper,\" she said. \"The way he looked at me... it wasn't him looking out from those eyes.\"\n\n\"What are you saying?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Just... be careful, okay? Maybe get a second opinion from another vet.\"\n\nIt was on the fourth night after his return that I woke to find him standing at the foot of my bed, perfectly still, staring at me. Not lying down, but standing. His eyes caught the faint light from my alarm clock, gleaming too brightly.\n\n\"Cooper, buddy? You need to go out?\" I murmured, still half-asleep.\n\nHe didn't respond. No tail wag, no shift in posture. Just continued staring.\n\n\"Cooper?\" I sat up, fully awake now.\n\nHe turned and walked from the room, movements stiff and deliberate. I heard his nails clicking down the hallway, then silence. When I got up to check, he was sitting in the kitchen, facing the back door, motionless again.\n\nI told myself it was nothing. Dogs are weird sometimes. Right?\n\nThe next morning, I found him in the same spot, as if he hadn't moved all night. His food bowl remained untouched.\n\nThat day, I caught him scratching at the walls, not like a normal dog might when hearing something inside, but methodically, in patterns. When I approached, he stopped immediately and walked away, that same stiff gait.\n\nI tried to call Dr. Levine but was told she was out of town for a conference. The receptionist offered to schedule me with the other vet at the practice, but something stopped me. What would I say? My dog stands still and stares at walls? He walks funny? They'd think I was overreacting.\n\nI should have reached out to someone then. Should have insisted on seeing another vet immediately. But a part of me was afraid of what they might find. Afraid they might want to take Cooper away from me. After spending two weeks thinking I'd lost him forever, I couldn't bear the thought of losing him again, even if this Cooper was... wrong.\n\nA week after his return, the nighttime incidents escalated. I woke to find him not at the foot of my bed, but beside it, his face level with mine, inches away. His eyes were wide, unblinking. And his mouth... this is hard to describe without sounding crazy... his mouth was pulled back too far, exposing all his teeth in what looked like a grotesque approximation of a smile. It wasn't like a normal dog panting. The corners of his mouth were stretched backward in a way that shouldn't be anatomically possible.\n\nI gasped and jerked backward. Cooper didn't move, didn't react to my startled response. Just kept staring, kept \"smiling.\"\n\n\"Cooper, no,\" I said firmly, using my training voice. \"Go to your bed.\"\n\nAfter what seemed like minutes, he slowly backed away, never breaking eye contact, never closing his mouth. He retreated to the corner of the room where he stood watching me until morning.\n\nI couldn't sleep again that night.\n\nThe next day, I noticed other things. The way he would suddenly stand alert, head cocked, listening to something I couldn't hear. The way he avoided his reflection in the hallway mirror. The way he spent hours staring at the same spot on the wall in my office, occasionally emitting a low growl that didn't sound like his voice. Too deep, almost layered, as if multiple throats were producing it.\n\nI searched online for explanations. Could it be some rare form of rabies that the vet had missed? A neurological disorder? Poisoning from something he'd found in the forest? Nothing matched his symptoms exactly. I found a few forum posts from people whose pets had returned from being lost with behavioral changes, but nothing like what Cooper was exhibiting.\n\nI took him back to the vet, who again found nothing physically wrong but suggested a veterinary behaviorist. The earliest appointment was two weeks out. The receptionist must have noticed my distress, because she lowered her voice and said, \"You found him at the Wilkins place, right? My cousin's hunting dog went missing there three years ago. When it came back...\"\n\n\"What?\" I pressed when she trailed off.\n\nShe glanced around, then leaned closer. \"They had to put it down. It started... hurting itself. And then it tried to hurt them.\"\n\nThat weekend, nine days after Cooper's return, I opened the trash can to find it empty when I knew it had been nearly full. Later that afternoon, I found Cooper in the backyard, hunched over something. When I approached, he growled. A sound that made the hair on my arms stand up. Before reluctantly moving away.\n\nHe'd been eating a dead rabbit. But not like a dog normally might. It was... arranged. Splayed out, innards exposed in what looked like a deliberate pattern. The ground around it had what appeared to be symbols scratched into the dirt, similar to what I'd seen in that cellar and on those trees.\n\nI vomited in the bushes.\n\nThat night, I locked Cooper in the spare bedroom. I needed one night of uninterrupted sleep to think clearly. At exactly 3:17 AM (I remember checking my phone), I woke to scratching sounds. Not on the bedroom door, but on my bedroom wall. The wall shared with the spare room.\n\nScratch, scratch, scratch. Pause. Scratch, scratch, scratch. Rhythmic. Deliberate.\n\nI turned on the light. The scratching stopped immediately.\n\nThen I heard it. A sound no dog should be able to make. Words. Not barking that sounded like words, but actual formed words, in a whispered voice that was not Cooper's, not human, but something else entirely.\n\n\"Let. Me. In.\"\n\nI convinced myself I was dreaming, even as I heard the knob of the spare room door turning. I'd locked it, I was sure I'd locked it.\n\nMorning found Cooper back in his usual spot in the kitchen, facing the back door. The spare room door was still locked. I must have dreamed it all...\n\nExcept for the deep scratch marks on the inside of my bedroom wall, exposed where a chunk of drywall had been torn away.\n\nI should have left then. Should have gotten in my car and driven far away. But where would I go? What would happen to Cooper? And some irrational part of me still hoped this was temporary, that my real dog would return to me if I just waited it out.\n\nI called Mrs. Abernathy, the only person who seemed to know anything about the history of this town, of the Wilkins place.\n\n\"You found him there, didn't you?\" she asked before I could explain. \"In that cellar.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I admitted. \"And now he's... not right. Something's wrong with him.\"\n\nShe was silent for so long I thought we'd been disconnected.\n\n\"Mrs. Abernathy?\"\n\n\"There were stories,\" she finally said, \"about what old man Wilkins was trying to do down there. Something about opening doors that should stay closed. Calling things through. Things that need... vessels.\"\n\n\"Vessels?\"\n\n\"Bodies,\" she clarified. \"To walk around in. My grandmother used to say the Wilkins family didn't vanish. They were... replaced.\"\n\n\"That's just superstition,\" I said, but my voice lacked conviction.\n\n\"Maybe so. But you listen to me, Alex. If your dog isn't your dog anymore, you need to consider what might be wearing his skin now. And why it came home with you.\"\n\nYesterday, things escalated further. I came home from grocery shopping to find Cooper sitting in the center of the living room, surrounded by every photograph in the house. All taken down from walls, removed from frames, and arranged in a spiral around him. In every single one, his image had been scratched out.\n\nAnd last night... last night was the worst.\n\nI pretended to sleep, keeping my eyes just slightly open, watching. Sure enough, around 2 AM, Cooper entered my room. He didn't walk normally. He moved in a jerking, almost insect-like fashion, his joints bending in ways they shouldn't. He approached the bed slowly, then climbed up with unnatural grace.\n\nI forced myself to keep breathing evenly, fighting against every instinct to run.\n\nHe loomed over me, that terrible smile spreading across his face, wider than should be physically possible for a dog. Then he leaned down until his face was directly above mine, his breath smelling of rot and copper.\n\nI couldn't maintain the pretense any longer. My eyes flew open fully, meeting his gaze.\n\n\"I know you're not Cooper,\" I whispered. \"What are you?\"\n\nThe smile grew impossibly wider. Then, slowly, methodically, he began to peel back his lips even further, exposing not just teeth but gums, then what looked like a second set of teeth behind the first.\n\nI scrambled backward, hitting the headboard hard. Cooper, or whatever was wearing Cooper's skin, made that layered growling sound again. Then, in that same whispered voice I'd convinced myself I had imagined:\n\n\"We. Found. You.\"\n\nI slept in my locked car last night.\n\nThis morning, Cooper acted normal. Almost too normal, like the old Cooper, waggling his tail, bringing me his leash. But his eyes... his eyes weren't right. They had always been warm brown, but now they seemed darker, with flecks of something that caught the light wrong.\n\nI packed a bag and drove to my parents' house thirty miles away. I told them Cooper was acting strange and I needed a break. They don't allow pets in their building, so he's still at my house, with enough food and water for a couple of days. I set up a pet camera to watch him.\n\nFor the first few hours, he just sat in the kitchen, staring at the back door. Then, an hour ago, he turned and looked directly at the camera. That smile spread across his face again.\n\nHe walked to the camera, movements fluid now, nothing like a dog. His face filled the screen, eyes blinking sideways, that impossible smile widening.\n\n\"Coming. For. You.\"\n\nThe feed went dead.\n\nMy phone just buzzed with a notification from my home security system. Back door open.\n\nI don't think Cooper is alone anymore. I don't think he ever was, since he came back.\n\nAnd I don't think whatever came back with him is staying in his body anymore.\n\nIf you see a chocolate Lab mix wandering around Millfield, please, please don't approach him. And if he's smiling... run."

    "selftext": "I\u2019ve always loved the Underground. There's something about it that's nostalgic, like a secret world buried beneath the city, with its rhythm. But I've learned to be careful about what you fall in love with, because sometimes, the deeper you go, the darker the things hiding there get.\n\nIt happened one cold evening. I'd been working late, the usual routine. The last train home. Empty stations, echoing footsteps. It was the kind of silence that made you feel like you were the only person left in the world.\n\nI was just about to board the last train when I noticed them. At first, it was a vague feeling\u2014like a slight itch on the back of my neck. Maybe a bug, perhaps a draft. But then that feeling became sharper, like a needle pricking my skin. I swatted at it, irritated, but it didn\u2019t go away. It felt like something was following me. Something that wasn\u2019t quite right.\n\nI tried to brush it off, but when I looked around, I saw them. Mosquitoes. They weren\u2019t the usual ones that buzz lazily around in the summer. These were different. Bigger. Darker. Their wings made a sound that felt heavier than anything that small should be able to make. They circled the station in a slow, deliberate pattern. Not random, like mosquitoes usually are, but calculated. Intentional. There were more than a few, and they seemed to be watching me.\n\nI tried to ignore it at first. Mosquitoes are pretty common, right? But these... they weren't acting like normal insects. They didn\u2019t scatter when I swatted at them. They didn\u2019t seem to be leaving me alone. I felt something crawl under my skin, an itchy, burning sensation that didn\u2019t make sense. I looked at my arm. There were already dozens of bites. Swollen, red, angry. But I didn\u2019t have time to dwell on that. I just needed to get out.\n\nI pushed through the turnstiles and headed for the platform. But then, I wasn\u2019t alone anymore. A few of the station workers were standing nearby. Their faces were pale and tired. One of them, an older man, noticed me looking and glanced around nervously.\n\n\u201cYou should be careful,\u201d he said quietly, almost like he was talking to himself. \u201cThey\u2019ve been multiplying in the tunnels. It\u2019s worse than before. They breed down there\u2014and it\u2019s not just the mosquitoes.\u201d\n\nI stared at him, confused. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\nHe looked away, his eyes darting to the shadows. \u201cThey\u2019ve been evolving. Growing. More aggressive. They\u2019re adapting to the heat, to the damp. They\u2019re becoming something else. Something meant to live down there now. And it\u2019s not just them. It\u2019s everything. The whole system\u2019s changing.\u201d\n\nI felt a chill run down my spine. \u201cEvolving? In the tunnels?\u201d\n\nThe old man nodded slowly, his gaze flicking nervously to the dark corners of the station. \u201cIt\u2019s the heat from the trains, the moisture. The deeper you go, the more you feel it. The rats, the cockroaches...they\u2019ve changed too. But the mosquitoes? They\u2019ve found something. They\u2019ve started feeding on more than blood. Their bites\u2014if they don\u2019t kill you\u2014they make you different.\u201d\n\nBefore I could ask more, the last train pulled into the station. He gave me a sharp look and turned away, disappearing into the shadows. I didn\u2019t get the chance to ask him anything else.\n\nI tried to shake off his words, but the feeling of dread only deepened. When I stepped onto the train, the atmosphere was different. The air felt thicker, the buzzing around me louder. I glanced out the window, my reflection warping as the train jerked forward. The lights flickered in the tunnels. And then, another bite.\n\nBut this time, it wasn\u2019t just a single prick. It felt deeper. Like something was crawling under my skin. The sting burned like it was digging in. And the worst part? I could feel them moving, burrowing deeper. I couldn't stop it. They were inside me.\n\nI started to panic. I pushed my way through the train, desperate to get to the door, but the tunnel stretched endlessly before me, a dark, twisting maze I couldn\u2019t escape. The train kept moving, but I wasn\u2019t sure it was even taking me anywhere anymore. Was I still in the Underground? Or had I crossed into something else? The station, the workers, the train, they all blurred together, a sickening fever dream.\n\nThe pain in my skin intensified as I reached the platform again, dizzy and shaking. The mosquitoes were still biting, still buzzing in my ears. I staggered to the surface, gasping for air. But they didn\u2019t stop. My skin was on fire, crawling with an itch I couldn\u2019t shake. Even outside, in the cold London air, they wouldn\u2019t leave me alone.\n\nI still hear them. Every night. The buzz of their wings, crawling under my skin. I don\u2019t know what happened down there, or what the workers knew, but I feel... different.\n\nSome say the mosquitoes aren\u2019t just biting anymore. They\u2019re changing us in tiny ways.  \nPassing things in their saliva.  \nNew infections, maybe.  \nMaybe something else.\n\nI\u2019ve heard stories. People who\u2019ve gone missing, found weeks later with bites all over them, twitching and mumbling in strange, half-forgotten languages. Their bodies look wrong, like they\u2019ve been remade, remolded for life underground.\n\nYou can still ride the Underground safely.  \nMostly.\n\nJust... don\u2019t take the last train.  \nAnd if you feel a sharp prick on your skin and you\u2019re alone in the carriage,  \n**don\u2019t scratch it.**\n\nThey can smell blood.  \nThey can feel heat.  \nThey can\u00a0*follow movement*.\n\nThe tunnels are their world now.  \nWe\u2019re just passing through."

It\u2019s ya boi here! Levans stories and animations on YouTube! And today, instead of writing some crappy story that\u2019ll get zero views! I\u2019d thought it would be a great idea to drive me and my stupid friend out here to an abandoned hospital for some creepy footage!\u201d\nXavier chuckled\n\n\u201cRight now it is.. uh\u2026 like 3AM! Creepy as hell! And scary. Also we\u2019re right here\u201d\nHe continued, stopping the car and waving ahead.\n\nIn front of our vehicle stood a large abandoned hospital. White walls stained and covered in foliage. Rust withering away the metal beams, shattered jagged windows gorged outwards.\n\nXavier opened his car door and began walking towards the entrance. Me, being a good cameraman, followed.\n\nXavier and I made our way into the main entrance. Filled with old rotting wooden chairs and tables, the ceiling tiles decaying away, widows sprawling downwards like vines.\n\n\u201cAs you can see! This place is creepy AS HELL!\u201d\nXavier shot up his hands, smiling and spinning around\n\n\u201cNot only will we be walking around here, but we\u2019ll be staying the whole night!\u201d\n\nI immediately lowered the camera down, my face going pale.\n\n\u201cDude, you said we\u2019d just explore a bit and leave. You didn\u2019t mention staying?\u201d\nI protested\n\nXavier scoffed and laughed\n\n\u201cLooks like my cameraman is an absolute loser!\u201d\nHe looked me dead in the eyes, silently begging me to agree.\n\nI sighed and raised the camera back up\n\n\u201cOk! Great! We\u2019re staying!\u201d\nI said excitedly\n\n\u201cExcellent! Now let\u2019s get-\u201c\n\nXavier was cut off, the clattering of metal echoed through the rotting corpse of the hospital.\nI spun the camera to face down a large empty hall.\n\n\u201cOk\u2026 there appears to be scary ghosts here\u2026 bet that noise will get me some views!\u201d\nXavier said awkwardly, beginning to make his way down the hall.\n\nI followed behind, shakily holding the camera\n\n\u201cUhh, Xavier, have you considered that homeless junkies could be inhabiting this place? I mean I really don\u2019t want a coke addict stabbing me or something\u201d\nI nervously spoke out\n\nXavier continued down the hallway, each step overly confident.\n\n\u201c\u201dHa! Does it look like anyone would ever stay here willingly? Even junkies wouldn\u2019t want to st-\u201c\nXavier was cut off again\n\nThe sound of metal clanking echoed through the building.\n\nHe stopped in his tracks, turning back to me.\n\n\u201cOk, seriously, did that sound closer this time?\u201d\n\nAnother loud clunk echoed through the building.\n\nXavier and I froze.\n\nI spun the camera around to where the noise was coming from.\nIt was now behind us, where the exit was.\n\nI turned the camera back to Xavier, who was still further down the hall than me\n\n\u201cDo you think we should just\u2026 cut this short now?\u201d\nI hesitantly asked. My heart beginning to hammer.\n\n\u201cYeah uhh\u2026 I thin-\u201c\n\nJust then a man dressed in a straitjacket and hockey mask wielding a knife lunged at him from an open door.\nXavier screamed in horror, but the man fell over to the floor clumsily and dropped the knife\nXavier\u2019s fear quickly turned into disappointment.\n\nHe sighed in frustration and kneeled down to the man.\n\u201cSimon for the love of god, seriously? You good man?\u201d\n\nSimon got to his knees, taking off the mask and dusting himself off\n\n\u201cYeah yeah I\u2019m good, stupid frikin ceiling tile caught my foot\u201d\nHe grunted, getting up to his feet.\n\n\u201cOk! Well now we got to do that whole thing again! Brandon, get to the car, I\u2019ll\u201d\n\nI stopped listening to Xavier. Movement down the dark hallway caught my attention.\n\nI raised the camera and focused the light down the hallway. A figure limply stumped against the wall.\n\nXavier and Simon stopped talking, their eyes fixed on the bloodied girl\nHer Raspy breathing echoed through the halls. Blood dripping from her mouth and chest, dirty hair covering her white misty eyes.\n\n\u201cXavier\u2026 who\u2019s this\u201d\nI sheepishly asked\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s uhh\u2026 I uhh\u2026 I.. don\u2019t know her?\u201d\nXavier\u2019s voice shook as he stared down the girl.\n\n\u201cXavier don\u2019t fuck with us, who is that?\u201d\nSimon responded, fully getting up and backing away\n\n\u201cNo! Seriously guys, I don\u2019t know her, it\u2019s just you two I invited here, I don\u2019t know who she is!\u201d\nXavier was cut off.\n\nA loud gory splat echoed through the rotting building.\nThe girl's right arm had fallen off.\n\nXavier and Simon looked back at the camera and me. Faces impossibly pale. \nBefore I could even process anything, both immediately began sprinting past me.\nI soon followed, desperately trying to keep up.\n\n\u201cXAVIER WHO THE HELL WAS THAT?\nI shouted as we threw my body into the car\n\nSimon crammed himself into the back seat.\n\n\u201cI DONT KNOW I DONT KNOW I DONT KNOW! YOU'RE STILL RECORDING?\u201d\nHe snapped at me\n\nI held the camera up to his face\n\n\u201cYES! I GOT IT ALL!\u201d\nI shouted back\n\n\u201cCUT THE CAMERA! WE\u2019RE OUTTA HERE\u201d\n\nXavier shoved the camera downwards, I pressed down on the button. Ending the recording.\n\nWe all looked at each other in silence.\nSimon was the first to chuckle.\n\n\u201cThat was great! First try too!\u201d\nHe smiled\n\n\u201cI told you guys, the whole switch a roo was a perfect scary video idea.\u201d\nXavier leaned back in his seat\n\nI placed the camera down on the dashboard \n\n\u201cHey uh, guys. I\u2019m going to go get clementine now. She did awesome!\u201d\nI chuckled, opening the car door and heading towards the entrance.\n\n\u201cComing with\u201d\n\n\u201cSame\u201d\n\nXavier and Simon responded.\n\nWe all pulled out our phones and made our way to the hallway where the video was recorded.\n\n\u201cClementine! You did great! Videos done now! Going home!\u201d\nNo response\u2026\n\nI frowned a bit\n\n\u201cClementine! It\u2019s over! No need to jump at us\u2026 just cmon\u201d\nI shouted out.\nFinally her body came into view.\n\nShe was still on the floor.\n\nSuddenly a horrific realization washed over me.\nHours before, when we were rehearsing our roles. Clementine was supposed to have a fake left arm fall off. Not her right.\nI froze in horror. Staring at her truly mangled corpse on the floor.\n\nXavier and Simon must\u2019ve come to the same realization as me.\nWe all stood in silence.\nSuddenly a loud metal clanking echoed just above us.\n"

    "selftext": "My name is Artur Amatis.\nAt least, that\u2019s the name I was given when Marilyn and Simon adopted me. I was five years old, too young to remember my real parents, and too desperate for love to question much about them.\nFor four years, life was\u2026 normal. Or so I thought.\nThey gave me a warm bed, hot meals, toys. everything a boy could want. Marilyn always kissed me on the forehead before bedtime. Simon taught me how to fix old clocks and catch frogs by the pond. I called them Mom and Dad, and I meant it.\nWhen I turned nine, they threw a birthday party for me. Balloons, chocolate cake, colorful hats. it was perfect. After the guests left, Simon leaned down to me with a strange look in his eye, one I hadn\u2019t seen before. \u201cCome with me, Artur,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a special surprise for you in the basement.\u201d I followed without hesitation. Wondering if they got me the electric car i wished for. The basement door groaned open, releasing a musty, metallic smell. We descended the creaking wooden stairs, the light growing dimmer with every step until Simon pulled a dangling chain, illuminating the room with a sickly yellow bulb, which was already on it\u2019s way of dying out. It flickered and sounded creepy to me. I looked arpund carefully and what I saw will never leave me. Tanks lined the walls, each one filled with grotesque creatures. A cat with the wings of a bat, a rabbit with the scales of a fish, a dog that blinked with human eyes. Some of them twitched, others floated lifelessly. In the corner, jars were stacked.. full of swirling, unnatural substances. Simon smiled proudly. \u201cThese,\u201d he said, waving an arm, \u201care my life\u2019s work. My experiments.\u201d\nI tried to step back, but his hand clamped down on my shoulder.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re special, Artur. Very special. And now\u2026 you\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\nBefore I could scream, he threw me onto a cold metal table. Straps snapped shut around my wrists and ankles. I begged him to stop, I cried for Marilyn, but she never came.\nSimon rummaged through the jars and selected one filled with a pulsing green liquid. I remember the label: UNKNOWN cMPs HUMAN #4\u00a3\u00a5*\u20ac\u00a3#*.\n\u201cThis one,\u201d he whispered, almost lovingly, \u201cthis one could change everything.\u201d\nThe needle gleamed under the basement light as he filled the syringe. I thrashed and struggled, but it was no use. The needle pierced my arm, and the burning started immediately. It felt like my veins were filled with fire and ice at the same time. I cried out, the stinging pain entering my system, my skin felt like it would melt away.\nSimon watched, fascinated, as my body convulsed.\nThen\u2026 he left.\nHe left me down there, strapped to that table, with only the humming tanks and the broken, twisted animals for company.\nThe first day, I screamed until my voice gave out.\nThe second day, I wept until my eyes were swollen shut.\nThe third day, something changed.\nMy skin began to tingle. I opened my eyes, waiting for them to adjust to the sickening darkness and saw a faint green glow pulsing beneath my skin, like the heartbeat of some alien creature. The pain in my muscles was replaced by an awful, coiling strength. I yanked at the straps. They tore like wet paper.\nI stood up, my body aching, my muscles tense. I barely recognized my own reflection in a cracked mirror on the wall. My eyes glowed faintly, and my hands trembled with barely contained power.\nI didn\u2019t think. I just ran.\nI smashed through the basement door and stumbled up the stairs. Simon was there, waiting at the top, holding another syringe. His eyes widened when he saw me.\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d he shouted. \u201cArtur, stop!\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t stop. I slammed into him, sending him crashing into the wall. His head hit the wood with a sickening crack, and he slumped to the floor. I didn\u2019t check if he was alive.\nI simply didn\u2019t care in that moment.\nI sprinted out of the house and into the night, the cold air burning my lungs. I ran until the lights of the house were far behind me, until the forest swallowed me whole. I don\u2019t know what happened to Marilyn.\nI don\u2019t know if Simon survived.\n\nAll I know is\u2026 I\u2019m not the same anymore.\nI can feel the green fire still inside me, whispering in my blood, changing me in ways I can\u2019t yet understand.\nI\u2019m not just Artur Amatis anymore.\nI\u2019m something else.\nSomething he created.\nSomething he couldn\u2019t control.\n\n(Part 2 will follow if wanted :))"

    "selftext": "Hello, I wish I could give you my name, but if I did, I would, at best, be labeled as a crazy conspiracy theorist and, at worst, be killed for what I am about to share. You can call me Agent 73, though. I work for a secret government organization investigating strange disappearances and deaths, particularly those involving cryptids, demons, and ghosts. If you are familiar with the TV show Supernatural, then you know the kind of work I'm referring to. One thing I would like to address before I go into more detail. If a case can be classified as a 411 missing person, we have investigated it and determined that it is not of a supernatural nature. If it were supernatural, then you would never have known about it. If someone were to talk about one of these instances, I have already stated what would happen.\u00a0\n\nI have been a field agent for twenty-three years, so there is no cryptid I am unfamiliar with or case I haven\u2019t investigated. I now specialize primarily in Appalachian cases, but I started my career in the Pacific Northwest. I reached my 500th case last month. I am sharing this information now, not because of a current government dispute or global tensions, but because I had just reached 250 cases five years ago. The pace of these cases has increased exponentially over the past five years, and I believe the general public will soon be at risk. There is one outlier, though: we lost track of the Mothman eight years ago. There are certain beings that we keep a close eye on, either due to their danger level or because they exhibit more omniscient tendencies. The Mothman was tracked for the latter, but it hasn\u2019t been seen in Mason County for eight years. There are rumors that it was on the move at that time, with a few cult members from Eastern Iowa having wounds that matched those of the Mothman. However, not all the wounds were consistent with the Mothman, so we believe it might be a copycat or a demon they had summoned.\u00a0\n\nYou may wonder why the government would need a secret organization to investigate these beings. I wish I had a cool answer, like it was the founding fathers, because of the legend of the New Jersey Devil, the Mothman terrorizing Mason County, or even the Patterson-Gimlin Film. Unfortunately, though, it was formed because of two brothers who were killed in 1925 at the height of moonshining and prohibition. We were initially formed to protect cryptids and other wildlife from people going out and killing everything that might have killed or harmed a family member or friend. Shortly after, though, things shifted as we realized what we were truly dealing with. I am about to share the case report of the initial event, along with the numerous reports and notes that followed.\u00a0\n\n\n\n*This report outlines and details the incident that occurred on July 15th, 1925. Cletus and Clarence Marshall were illegally traveling on a level B road through the Applichola region. While they were traveling under the cover of night, they were attacked by a creature that could travel roughly at the same speed as their modified 1923 Ford Model T Pickup Truck. This was concluded by the footprints that were recovered from the scene, and the two spent 45-70 cartridges that were discovered about 150 yards from the accident scene. Cletus was found on the road about 30 yards from the accident scene. He had suffered minor scrapes and possible head trauma before he was killed due to a massive hole in his chest caused by blunt force trauma. We discovered his sternum and two vertebrae along the side of the road, roughly 3 yards from his body. The accident scene was situated at the bottom of a cliffside that sat at a curve in the road. Part of the roof had deep imprints, as if something strong had gripped it as the vehicle was moving. The common theory is that the beast distracted Clarence long enough to force him off the road. The scene at the bottom of the cliff was gruesome in nature. The Model T Pickup had overturned, and all the alleged illegal bottles had broken. We were able to recover one bottle that had remnants of what is believed to be an unlawful alcohol substance. The substance was jarred and sent to the lab for forensics to verify the contents. Clarence's body was recovered about 20 yards from the accident scene. It was wrapped around a tree in such a manner that his skin was torn around his midsection. His lower and upper intestines were observed to be leaking from the areas of torn skin. Upon moving his body for retrieval, it was also discovered that he had suffered a broken leg, and his lower spine was protruding from his back. It is believed that whatever creature threw Clarence had enough power to snap his spinal column. Clarence\u2019s official cause of death is dismemberment and blood loss.*\u00a0\n\n*Note: This case warrants special consideration due to its location and the public's outrage. Locals have already expressed desire to form hunting parties, which could lead to more lives lost, given the capabilities noted in this report. Locals should be kept out of the woods.*\n\n  \n\n\nI would now like to explain how I became involved in this line of work and why this first case is significant. As you might have guessed, this line of work is incredibly challenging to enter, making most of the agents descendants of the agents who worked the first few cases. My great-grandfather was one of these people. My grandfather, his brothers, my father, and my uncles were all agents in the Organization. I thankfully won\u2019t be passing down my role to anyone. As things have escalated, I find comfort in having never married and not having to drag someone through the emotions associated with not knowing if their partner is coming home or not.\u00a0\n\nMy great-grandfather was involved with this first case. He was an investigating detective for a town in the region and would often handle the more brutal cases within the county. He was ahead of his time, as he was meticulous about every scene he investigated. He would frequently expand the initial search radius by about fifty to one hundred yards. In one of his notebooks, he explained that he did this as he noticed a glint while taking a smoke break on a particularly gruesome crime scene. The glint was a small knife that matched the wounds found in the victim\u2019s chest. It was a ruthless murder. The victim had been stabbed thirty-three times in the chest and had both arms severed from their body. Based on the marks on the exposed socket joints, it was determined that the same small blade was used to sever both arms from the body. I am currently investigating this case, over a hundred years later, as there is a connection to a case I am working on at the moment. However, I will save that information for when the current investigation has been concluded. I will continue with the first case shortly, but I must return to my work. We just got another call about a situation in Atlanta. \n\n"

    "selftext": "When I was growing up, my mother would have a new boyfriend almost every month. She was an amazing woman who I wouldn\u2019t have traded for the world but she was raised by horrible people, had an abusive high school sweetheart, and had a hard time saying \u201cNo.\u201d The cycle usually went that she would meet some jackass at her job, I never learned what she did for a living, and likely for good reason, and he would love bomb her until he found a nicer piece of tail or found out I existed. I ended up being the deal breaker more times than not from what I can remember. Darren was the first to break the cycle sticking around for 4 months before they got engaged and he moved in which was when the troubles started. I remember being 6 years old watching Power Rangers and Darren walked over to me to put a cigarette out on the webbing between my fingers which soon became his preferred way of saying hello. Through the walls of our shitty Section 8 apartment, I could hear him screaming at my mom every night before beating her. It would only end when he went out for a beer, in which case my mom would \u201csleepover\u201d in my room, or when he would get bored and demand she go to sleep. Darren made it very clear that if anyone came to check up on me or my mom that would be it for all of us and God knows I believed him. Even at my young age, I could tell from the look in his eyes that he was capable of and willing to do anything. I wore gloves year-round to hide the burns on my hands, came up with a hundred different stories for a hundred different bruises, and prayed every night the police would get lost when our neighbors called in a disturbance. When summer came around I would have the apartment to myself while Darren and Mom went to work. We didn\u2019t have the money for camps or water parks so I would fill out phonics and math workbooks during commercial breaks. Then, about a month into the Summer, I got a knock at the door.\n\n\u201cIssac? My name is Finn. Your mother hired me to be your summer sitter.\u201d I opened the door to a tall, skinny man holding a briefcase filled to bursting with toys and activities. \u201cHello, Issac, can I come in?\u201d\n\nFinn and I would do my daily homework together before making art projects or playing with the wrestling figures he brought over. We\u2019d end each day with a walk around the neighborhood and get back just before anyone got home. I\u2019d go back to my apartment and Finn would go to his at the very end of the hall. Every time we parted ways he\u2019d hand me a candy from his briefcase and say \u201cSame time tomorrow, little man\u201d snapping his fingers and pointing at me. That would make me laugh every time. The good times with Finn gave me something to look forward to even when Darren got especially cruel. That summer his job started layoffs and despite his constant swearing they could never dump him I suspect it was the stress that led to his new rule. Talking without being spoken to was liable to get you beat, our apartment was so cramped he could hear me whisper to my mom which would always send him into a fury. I maybe spoke two times to my mom in that entire period and I didn\u2019t dare to so much as look at Darren, not like that saved me from his wrath or anything.\u00a0\n\nAround this time, Finn started asking me about my bruises, and I went through my usual stories to explain them. Finn wasn\u2019t as easily deterred as a teacher or cop, however. Sometimes, he\u2019d catch me in conflicting stories or press me on details, and I\u2019d trip up. I stuck to my guns, however, and never told him anything. In hindsight, I wish I had, but it didn\u2019t end up mattering.\u00a0\n\n\u201cY\u2019know, you can tell me anything. You aren\u2019t going to be in any trouble.\u201d I knew Finn wouldn\u2019t hurt me but I still couldn\u2019t say anything to him, Darren\u2019s threats had my conscience hostage. I just said \u201cOk\u201d and he gave me a look like I really hurt him with that.\u00a0\n\nMaybe because of that, our art projects became therapy sessions. When I told Finn my dreams were scaring me we made dream catchers and talked about how to destress before bed. We made paper superhero masks when I said I wished I was braver. The one time I even implied Darren could be a bad guy, Finn had to draw a knight and a dragon then helped me prop them up on a page like a pop-up book. We had a long talk about how knights are heroes in a story, they don\u2019t cover for bad guys or make excuses when they mess up. They summon their courage and do what\u2019s right even if puts someone else at risk because heroes fight dragons they don\u2019t protect them. The meaning wasn\u2019t lost on me but at that age, you can dodge any type of guilt by just not thinking about it. No matter what my issue was, Finn had an art project for it. It was like he had everything we could ever need in that briefcase.\n\nOne day he came home stomping mad. Finn and I had made origami cranes and I planned to give mine to my mom but she didn\u2019t get home first. Darren picked up the crane from the coffee table, sparked his cigarette lighter, and burned it in front of my eyes. I wanted to beat the shit out of him to just take my tiny, scarred hands and smash them into his chest until his ribcage broke open. I screamed in a way you can\u2019t replicate or do justice to in writing, my breaking point was reached and I lost complete control of my body as I ran up and bit into Darren\u2019s leg so hard I swear I felt his tibia grind between my teeth. Darren pulled me back and shouted horrible things as he wrapped his hands around my neck and squeezed.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna kill you, fucking cum stain. I\u2019m gonna bury you in a scrap yard.\u201d He didn\u2019t make good on that promise, he just threw me against a wall right as my vision began to blur. I scurried to my room and blocked the door with a folding chair I kept in case things got really bad.\u00a0\n\nWhen my mom got home Darren wasted no time showing her his battle scar and saying I should be put up for adoption or kicked into the street. She tried to talk him down and got hit in return, I could hear her gasping for air between sobs and screaming \u201cHe\u2019s just a baby!\u201d as Darren desperately tried to break my makeshift barricade. He must\u2019ve been too drunk to counter the oldest trick in the book. I didn\u2019t sleep that night and neither did my mom, every time I braved a peek under the door I could see her slumped against the wall crying or passed out once cursing that she was ever born. When I let Finn in the next day his usual bright smile was absent. He asked about the bruise that wrapped around my neck like a scarf and I said I got it wrestling some neighborhood kids.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYour eyes look so tired, didn\u2019t you sleep?\u201d I just looked down and said I had a nightmare. Finn frowned and squatted to be eye level with me, \u201cIssac, lets take the day off from homework. You wanna go to the zoo?\u201d What kid doesn\u2019t? We spent hours exploring the place, Finn put me on his shoulders when my legs got tired but wouldn\u2019t move an inch until I was ready for the next animal. We were watching big fish in the aquarium when he sat down on a bench and I sat with him.\n\n\u201cWhat's your favorite color, Issac?\u201d Maybe it was because we were surrounded by it but I instantly said blue. \u201cNo argument here, that's a good one. Lots of versatility too, some people think it's very calming but it\u2019s been used to represent loyalty and trust too. Means you got a good heart, little man.\u201d We paused to watch a shark swim over our heads in the clear viewing room.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow about your mom, what\u2019s her favorite color?\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure about this one. Again, Darren\u2019s tight restrictions on when we could speak had caused me to rarely speak to my mom, and at 6 years old its not like you have a lot of information about your mom memorized. I knew what colors were girly though and picked purple. \u201cGood taste runs in the family. Purple used to be a really expensive color you know, they reserved it for royalty.\u201d Finn\u2019s face turned serious and he looked me in the eyes, \u201cI know things are hard for you guys right now but try to remember your mom does a lot for you. Most people don\u2019t appreciate it until they\u2019re really big kids, being a mom is a thankless job most of the time, try to remind her how much you love her as often as you can, ok?\u201d That\u2019s the type of emotional sentiment you don\u2019t understand until you\u2019re older but even then I felt my heart grow a bit. The sharks above us started to chase each other and I giggled cheering on the smaller one deftly ducking his pursuer.\u00a0\n\nOn the bus ride back, Finn offered me a piece of candy and asked \u201cWhat\u2019s your least favorite color?\u201d This one was easy, I hated yellow. \u201cSame here buddy, never seen a shade of yellow that wasn\u2019t tacky or garish. You ever hear someone get called \u2018yellow-bellied\u2019 on TV, Issac?\u201d I had once in a cowboy cartoon but told Finn I didn\u2019t know what it meant. \u201cIt means cowardly, a scaredy cat, and do you know what the mark of a real yellow-bellied man is? It's being a bully, no is more cowardly than someone who hurts others to make himself feel big.\u201d Finn\u2019s gaze turned inquisitive like his eyes were the interrogation lamp you see in police dramas. He asked me in the most serious tone, \u201cRemind you of anyone, Issac?\u201d\u00a0\n\nGod knows I wanted to say Darren. Just like when we learned about bullies in school. Just like when the preacher asked if any of us knew a bad person. Just like when the teacher asked where my bruises came from. Just like when the police asked if I had heard anything scary. I wanted to scream \u201cDarren! Darren! It's him! Fucking shoot the bastard!\u201d But if I did, Darren would\u2019ve hurt us terribly. So I said no, that I don\u2019t talk to bad guys and all my friends are nice. Finn sighed and checked his watch. \u201cWe\u2019ve got time for one more activity little man. I think you\u2019re gonna like this one.\u201d\n\nWhen we got home, Finn opened his briefcase and pulled out a box of cupcake mix. After a few minutes of searching for the right pans and trays we got to work and produced one beautiful tray of little domed treats. We ate them until only four were left at which point Finn set them on top of the fridge and got another box from his briefcase, frosting mix, then a set of food color droppers. We made three small bowls of frosting: Blue, purple, then yellow. Finn put blue on two cupcakes, these we shared, then purple on one, and finally, he took his time applying the yellow frosting on the last.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWho should we give these to?\u201d Finn asked with a smirk. I said my mom and Finn said grown-ups can only eat one cupcake a day or they get sick, their stomachs don\u2019t handle sugar as well as kids do. I didn\u2019t want to but I said Darren could have one too. \u201cGood, maybe it\u2019ll make him happy.\u201d Finn washed the dishes and put the cupcakes on separate plates before heading back down the hall to his apartment after giving me another piece of candy. This many sweets paired with the zoo trip had Finn in a close race with my mom and the red ranger for the greatest person alive.\u00a0\n\nMom got home first that day and I proudly gave her the purple cupcake. She smiled brightly for the first time I can remember seeing and asked how I made them.\n\n\u201cFinn helped me!\u201d I said, beaming. She cocked her head but smiled and finished her treat.\u00a0\n\nWhen Darren got home he cursed the traffic and screamed out for dinner to be ready. With lead feet and trying not to scowl, I offered him the yellow cupcake. To my surprise, he thanked me before inhaling it, even said my name. I still remember the wonderful dreams I had that night, would\u2019ve been one for the record books if I didn\u2019t wake with a jolt as my mom screamed bloody murder. I ran to her room because this wasn\u2019t the screaming I had learned meant I should hide, this was a brand new kind of scream that told my instincts to check out what was happening. Lying next to my mom in bed was Darren. He had clearly been thrashing violently in his sleep with one arm under him at an unnatural angle and his knees pointing up with legs spread like he was giving birth. But his face is what I really remember, it's been a recurring topic with every therapist I\u2019ve ever had.\u00a0\n\nHis eyes were piss yellow and wide open. Try as I have, and believe you me I have tried, I can\u2019t open mine that wide without using my fingers and enduring some great discomfort. His jaw was open and popped to the side like a freeze frame from a Mike Tyson hook, detectives on the scene said it was dislocated. His skin was drawn tight over his skull, and this really stood out on a big guy like Darren. Imagine if you could vacuum seal one of those Mission Impossible masks and then left it out in the sun so its color fades and that's about what I was looking at. From his forehead down to the left corner of his lips was one long scratch, not the type you give yourself when you forget to trim your nails before bed but more like what a pissed-off cat leaves. All of this froze me in place. When I did get the courage to step forward, my knees buckled. Mom scooped me up and took me to the kitchen where she dialed 911. I don\u2019t remember much of the following but after a week of questioning and investigation, they finally left us alone to piece together our lives again.\u00a0\n\nMom stayed home with me for a few days after that. We did my homework together and went on walks through the park. I thought about asking where Finn was, but honestly, I was still so shocked from seeing my first corpse that I didn\u2019t say much at all during that time. When my mom went back to work, Finn came over for the last time.\n\n\u201cListen, Issac, school is gonna start soon for you and that means you won\u2019t need me for a while. I want you to be good for your mom, ok? She loves you dearly and this is going to be a hard time for her.\u201d\t\u201cWill you be my babysitter next summer?\u201d Finn had become like a big brother to me, I didn\u2019t want to face the world without him or go a day without our fun arts and crafts projects.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry little man. I\u2019m going to college soon and by the time summer starts for you I\u2019m gonna be a long ways away. But we\u2019ll always have our memories, ok? Anytime you start to miss me just do some origami like we like to do.\u201d He smiled and put a hand on my shoulder. \u201cIf I start to miss you, I\u2019ll watch do our Power Ranger poses.\u201d That day he taught me how to handle the strong feelings I had in the fallout of Darren kicking the bucket and we made stress toy cootie catchers.\n\nMom and I moved out as soon as we were able. It took about a month of searching for an affordable spot and two months of saving money to finally leave and for all of it Mom slept with me in my bed. Not that I minded, I was honestly happy Darren was dead and I finally had time to be a kid with my mom again. When we did move out I helped move boxes down to our van. It was when I ran up to get the last box that I saw the door at the end of the hallway was open a jar.\u00a0\n\n\u201cFinn? Finn, you left your door open!\u201d I shouted across the hall to no reply. I bounced over and repeated myself to the same effect. Childlike curiosity and disregard for social boundaries led me to push open the door and peek at Finn\u2019s apartment. In hindsight, it makes sense. Just looking at the outside of the building raises questions about where you\u2019d even have space for something there. Behind that door was just a utility closet.\n\n"

    "selftext": "August 31, 2024.\n\n\n\nI've always loved reading horror stories. They fascinated me, especially those with a macabre plot twist. I enjoyed reading them while sipping my coffee, but ever since that damned incident last month, I haven't been able to open a single story again.\n\n\n\nThat morning, as usual, I was browsing creepypasta subreddits while drinking my coffee. I'd practically read them all. But that day, something strange happened. Amid thousands of posts flooded with upvotes and comments, there was one story... with no likes, no comments. Completely forgotten. I clicked. I started reading.\n\n\n\n***WARNING.***\n\n\n\nThe story was clich\u00e9. Nothing special. It seemed inspired by those old slasher films where teenagers get massacred. THE IRONY. Just another recycled story among so many. I finished reading and went to work. Another shitty day, with my boss yelling at me as usual.\n\n\n\nWhen I got home, I noticed something strange. The front door was slightly open. At first, I thought I'd forgotten to lock it.\n\n\n\n***STOP.***\n\n\n\nI entered cautiously. My town wasn't known for high crime rates. I searched the entire house. Nothing out of the ordinary. I tried to forget about it and carry on with my night.\n\n\n\nAt 1 a.m., I woke up. The hallway light was flickering nonstop.\n\n\n\n\"Damn faulty wiring again...\" I muttered, going back to sleep.\n\n\n\nFive minutes later, I woke up startled by the sound of plates shattering in the kitchen. Horror clich\u00e9s are pure fiction, RIGHT?\n\n\n\nI got up and went to the kitchen. Everything was a mess. I was organized. This wasn't normal.\n\n\n\nAs I picked up the broken plates, I saw marks... of blood. Messages written:\n\n\n\n***YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE READ THAT STORY.***\n\n\n\nMy stomach turned to ice. How did someone know? This was always my secret hobby. I screamed. I called the police.\n\n\n\nThey arrived quickly. They collected blood samples. No signs of a break-in. The kitchen didn't even have a window.\n\n\n\nDays later, the results: the blood was mine. But how? I wasn't injured. I had no history of sleepwalking. I didn't do drugs.\n\n\n\n***OR DID I?***\n\n\n\nThe police dismissed it as a prank. They warned me. But the messages kept coming. Every night, in different places: on the bathroom mirror, on the bedroom window.\n\n\n\n***I WARNED YOU.***\n\n\n\nAnd it wasn't just messages. \"Accidents\" that could have been fatal started happening\u2014coincidentally.\n\n\n\nA brick fell out of nowhere, almost hitting me. A pitbull attacked me for no reason. I was nearly run over by a speeding car\u2014I was the only pedestrian on the street. I slipped three times in the shower, with no explanation.\n\n\n\nAnd then my house... caught fire. No cause. I lost everything.\n\n\n\nHomeless, I got fired from my job. I had no peace. I moved back in with my parents, but I quickly realized I was putting them in danger.\n\n\n\nNow I'm writing this on my phone. If you're reading this, understand: sooner or later, I won't be able to escape. This thing will get me. There's no use fighting.\n\n\n\nThe story I read... condemned me. And if you've read this far...\n\n\n\n***YOU'RE NEXT.***"

    "selftext": "\n\n\nThe old diesel truck coughed loudly before falling completely silent, parked next to the tool shed. The engine had a life of its own, just like the house\u2019s power generator, which had already failed three times that week. \"It's a gas guzzler,\" Dad used to say. We always kept a can of gasoline next to the outdoor cabinet \u2014 an emergency measure we knew we\u2019d eventually need. Life out there was like that: patched together, fragile, but functional \u2014 at least most of the time.\n\nThe night before, the usual calm of the farm was broken by the frantic barking of the dogs. Dad, used to small intrusions by wild animals, grabbed his shotgun and walked out with heavy steps. I followed, carrying a flashlight. \"Stay behind me,\" he ordered, his eyes fixed on the darkness.\n\nThe dogs were circling the pigpen, their bodies tense as if facing something invisible. There was a metallic smell in the air \u2014 a mix of blood and damp earth. As we got closer, we saw the scene: one of the pigs was dead, thrown against the broken fence. Its skin had been torn off in patches, exposing its ribs. The eyes seemed to have been gouged out.\n\n\"Cougar,\" Dad said, but the word came out hesitant. I looked at him, noticing the doubt in his voice. \"Was it a cougar, Dad?\" I asked, my eyes wide. He didn\u2019t answer right away. He inspected the surroundings, but there were no tracks, no clear signs of a struggle.\n\nBack inside, he reinforced the door locks and muttered to himself, \"Just an animal. I'll take care of it tomorrow.\" But deep down, something was bothering him. That strange smell, the silence that took over the forest after the barking stopped \u2014 it was as if the woods themselves were too scared to breathe.\n\nThat night, I had trouble sleeping. I woke up twice, swearing I heard something scratching at the wood outside. The second time, I tried to ignore it, but an inexplicable chill ran down my spine.\n\nDad didn\u2019t sleep either. He stayed in the living room, shotgun within reach, listening to the generator\u2019s intermittent hum outside. When the machine failed for the third time, he almost went to check it, but changed his mind. \"In the morning,\" he thought, as if making an empty promise.\n\nHe had no idea that dawn would bring more than just a simple generator repair. Something was lurking out there \u2014 something that wasn\u2019t a cougar, or anything he could face alone.\n\nAnd it was just getting started.\n\nThe sun had barely risen when Dad went out. I followed, dragging my feet, still heavy from lack of sleep. The smell of the dead pig already filled the air \u2014 sour and nauseating. The fence was still broken, and the chickens wouldn\u2019t stop clucking, restless, as if something was still prowling nearby.\n\n\"Go get the tarp from the shed,\" Dad told me, holding the flashlight. I hesitated, glancing at the forest around us, but obeyed. When I came back with the tarp, he had already dragged the pig out of the pen, trying to ignore the animal\u2019s gruesome state.\n\nThe body was almost unrecognizable. The claw marks were deep and distorted, as if the creature that attacked it had inhuman strength. Dad tried to rationalize it. \"It was a cougar. It had to be a cougar.\" But the absence of tracks and the mysterious silence from the day before still unsettled him.\n\nWe wrapped the pig in the tarp and dragged it to a hole near the back fence where Dad usually buried dead animals. The work was slow and unpleasant, and even the crows that usually hovered around stayed away, as if sensing danger.\n\n\"Done. It's over,\" Dad said, wiping sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand. But he knew he was lying.\n\nThe rest of the day was filled with an uncomfortable silence. I tried to keep up with daily chores, but the tension in the air was palpable. \"Dad, are you going to leave the fence like that?\" I asked late in the afternoon, but he just shook his head.\n\n\"I'll take care of it tomorrow. I'll check the generator before dark,\" he replied, grabbing his tools from the shed. He spent the whole afternoon trying to get the damn motor running properly, but the problem seemed bigger than he thought. The gas can next to the cabinet remained untouched, but every time he passed by it, a strange unease climbed up his spine.\n\nThe sun began to set, painting the sky blood-red, and the tension on the farm only grew. I brought the dogs closer to the house and locked up the pigpen. \"Dad, can we go to bed early tonight?\" I asked as the lights started to flicker.\n\n\"Yeah, we are,\" he replied. But Dad had no intention of sleeping. Something inside him screamed that the night would bring worse problems than a broken generator.\n\nWhile we were having dinner, the dogs started barking again. This time, it wasn\u2019t just a warning \u2014 it was pure terror. Dad stood up, grabbed his shotgun, and looked at me. \"Stay inside.\"\n\"But what about you, Dad?\" I asked, clutching his arm tightly.\n\"I'll be right back. I just need to see what it is.\"\n\nBut deep down, he knew he wasn\u2019t ready for what awaited him outside. The night was alive, breathing through the house like a beast stalking its prey. And it hadn\u2019t shown its teeth yet.\n\nWhen he went out, the sight was horrifying: two of the dogs were dead, their bodies twisted at impossible angles, as if crushed by something monstrous. The third was barking at the darkness but suddenly fell silent, letting out a final agonized yelp before being dragged into the woods.\n\nDad smelled it. It wasn\u2019t just blood \u2014 it was something deeper, like rotten flesh mixed with sulfur. He pointed his flashlight at the trees, and what he saw made his blood run cold: glowing yellow eyes, burning like embers.\n\n\"Who's there?!\" he shouted, his voice betraying his fear. The answer came as a guttural growl, a sound that seemed to vibrate through the very ground. Then, a figure emerged. It wasn\u2019t a man, nor an animal. It was something in between, with deformed muscles and black fur that seemed to pulse. Its long, filthy claws gleamed under the weak beam of the flashlight.\n\nThe creature lunged with impossible speed. Dad fired. The shot echoed through the night, but the monster didn\u2019t stop. The impact only seemed to enrage it. It knocked him to the ground with a brutal blow, his shotgun flying out of reach. As he tried to get up, he saw the creature tearing into one of the dogs like it was just a snack.\n\nInside the house, I heard my father's screams and started praying, but I knew prayers wouldn\u2019t be enough. I grabbed the machete Dad kept behind the door, my heart pounding as heavy footsteps approached.\n\nThe door burst inward, and the creature entered, its eyes locked onto me. I screamed, terrified, but didn\u2019t back down. As the monster lunged, I swung with all my strength, striking its face. A horrible howl filled the air, but the machete got stuck in its thick flesh.\n\nDad, wounded, crawled to the door and saw the scene: I was struggling while the monster gripped my arm, lifting me like a rag doll. \"Let go of my daughter, you bastard!\" Dad grabbed the gasoline can with trembling hands and doused the creature before striking a match.\n\nThe fire engulfed the monster, which thrashed in agony, dropping me. The smell of burning flesh was nauseating, but even in flames, the creature didn\u2019t die. With a final roar, it ran into the woods, disappearing into the darkness.\n\nWe survived, but we didn\u2019t come out unscathed. My father lost his right arm that night, and I was left with scars that will never fade. Despite everything, we decided to stay on the farm. We reinforced the fences, took turns keeping watch, and always kept our weapons close.\n\nBut the howl of that creature still echoes in my nightmares. I know it\u2019s not dead.\nI know one day it will come back to finish what it started.\nAnd all we can do is be ready to face it.\n\n\n\n\n"

His hatred fermented in the bowels of the earth until, beneath a tomb of ancient bones, he found what should never have been unearthed: the Heart of Wrath.\n\nThe artifact pulsed like a living tumor, each beat exuding a miasma of age-old rancor. Upon touching him, the rotting flesh of his corpse smoked, regenerating into a grotesque amalgam of viscera, exposed nerves, and blackened bones. She was reborn \u2014 but not as a woman. He was reborn as a walking altar of pain.\n\nHis fury was so thick that it made the air sharp. The first traitors barely had time to scream. She tore them apart with her bare hands, plunging her fingers into their ribs, tearing them apart like wet paper until the exposed hearts fluttered between her fingers. Then, he devoured them while they were still hot, feeling the blood run down his chin and soak the ground.\n\nIt wasn't enough.\n\nShe skinned the still-living bodies, hung the bloody skins like funeral flags, and strung empty skulls on stakes, forming trails of horrors that snaked through the surrounding villages.\n\nEach new massacre was more savage, more creative in its brutality: entire families impaled alive, children sewn together with torn tendons, men forced to swallow their own eyes before having their insides pulled out like streamers of flesh.\n\nThe Heart of Wrath, fused in his chest, pulsed in frenzy with each death, with each bloodbath. She became more monstrous\u2014her arms thickening with twisted muscles, her eyes turning into slits that wept black pus.\n\nIn the end, the villages were just heaps of putrid flesh, fields where the viscera ran like scarlet rivers. The smell of clotted blood permeated the earth, the sky and the soul of any unfortunate person who dared to breathe there.\n\nThey say that you can still hear, on stormy nights, the wet and horrendous sound of hearts being ripped out, accompanied by a chorus of laments that will never find rest.\nBecause She doesn't just seek revenge \u2014\nShe seeks to satisfy a hunger that will never be satisfied again.\n\nAnd if the Heart of Wrath feels the beating of your chest... it will guide It to you.\n\n"

    "selftext": "A few months ago, I moved into a small town in rural Ohio. The place was cheap a rundown little house that used to belong to a retired Vietnam veteran. They said he passed away in the nearby forest back in the '70s.\n\nThe house was nearly empty except for some old furniture and dust. But on my first night, I found something strange.\n\nAn old, folded letter tucked between the sofa cushions.\nI\u2019m not sure why, but I felt like I had to read it.\n\nHere\u2019s what it said:\nI lost my best friend in Vietnam... He said he found paradise.\n\nIt was a strange day the last day I ever saw him. It happened during the Battle of Yawoting in Vietnam. A brutal, unforgiving war. The terror still clings to me. Guerrillas set up traps and killed my comrades silently. Day or night, it didn\u2019t matter. They were like ghosts stalking us, studying us learning how we moved, how we lived, so they could kill us better.\n\nEvery night we tried to rest, but the sun would rise again just to blind us with fresh fear. One by one, the ghosts took us. They were patient. Our lead officer got cocky. The next day, we found him ripped in half, painting the green ground crimson.\n\nThey chewed through us slowly, savoring every moment, knowing if they made even a single sound, we would fill them with lead. Blood filled the lakes. Blood filled our minds. We barely slept. Our bodies twitched and trembled, our minds stretched thin, knowing death could come at any second.\n\nBut at least... I had him. The one person who kept me sane.\n\nAngelo. My best friend.\n\nI met him during training free-spirited, fearless, a little rebellious. Everyone loved him. He once showed me a picture of his family: four smiling kids and a beautiful wife. \"I can\u2019t wait to go home and wrap my arms around them,\" he said, smiling through tears. He never slacked. He trained hard, harder than any of us, but because of that he was always hungry  constantly raiding the canteen. He had dreams. He had purpose.\n\nOne night, deep in the jungle, the darkness thickened like fog. I stayed up on watch, exhausted but too scared to sleep. I asked Angelo to take the next shift.\n\n\"Angelo?\" He nodded too fast, unnaturally, like a puppet. Something felt wrong. But I was too tired to think about it.\n\nA few hours later, I heard him whispering. Over and over. Soft. Repeating. Like he was praying.\n\nAt midnight, I heard him clearly:\n\"I found paradise. Come with me.\"\n\nI opened my eyes. I saw him sprinting into the jungle barefoot, fast, desperate. I followed, called his name, but he disappeared into the darkness. Gone.\n\nI stumbled back to our tent, shaking. His hammock was empty. All that remained was his hanging, chipped dog tag. We couldn't search in the dark. Too dangerous.\n\nWhen daylight came, we searched. No sign. No blood. No tracks. No Angelo.\n\nThe war ended years later.\n\nI demanded an investigation. The CIA called it: \"MIA.\" Missing In Action. Some soldiers said he went mad. Others said he tried to escape hell. But his body was never found.\n\nWhen I came home, everything was gone. My family was distant. No girlfriend. No friends. Nothing.\n\nI tried drinking. I tried drugs. Nothing numbed it.\n\nEvery night, I walked to a hilltop and smoked cigars under the moonlight. And that's when I started hearing them. Voices, soft and promising, whispering through the stars\n\"Follow us.\"\n\nThey opened my eyes. They showed me. Angelo was right. He found paradise.\n\nI followed him there.\n\nYou should too.\n\n\nWhen I finished reading the letter I took a picture of it to show to my friends, and I laughed it off. Crazy old soldier stuff, I thought.\n\nBut last night...\nwhile I was sitting outside, smoking a cheap cigar or at least I thought it was a cigar and staring up at the moon, I swear I heard whispering.\n\n\"Follow us.\"\n\nI froze. Slowly, I looked over my shoulder... nothing.\nI checked the whole damn yard still nothing.\nThen I muttered to myself,\n\"Holy sht... this place is f**king haunted. And I'm here just trying to relax for once.\n\nI slipped the old letter back exactly where I found it.\nI didn\u2019t want anything to do with that paranormal sh*t.\n\nA week later, I packed up and moved to a different town.\nBut even now, I can\u2019t shake the feeling.\nI still haven\u2019t had a decent night\u2019s sleep since. But atleast im starting to see his truth now."

I was at the store getting snacks and drinks late one night and noticed the screen that shows all the sections of the building were all replaying wherever I was, it wasn't showing anyone or anything else, some of the footage looked like it was right behind me , after paying for my stuff I quickly ran home , I shut and locked the door, I tried to watch TV , read a book , clean up the house a bit, anything to get my mind off of this weird situation but even though I was in the privacy of my own home , I still felt that paranoia that someone or something was staring at me the whole time. The Day After I went to work, I'm a janitor in a warehouse , make sure everything is clean and working, and once again , I felt like I was being stalked. The Day After I went hiking , and again that same uneasy feeling swept over me.  A couple days later I went to work again , I had to work overtime and there wasn't that much employees around that night , and yet again for like the millionth god damn time , I felt the exact same feeling , so I grabbed onto a metal pipe that was on the floor and swung it at whatever was behind me , at first I saw nothing, until the pipe made impact with an invisible force , when it hit the unknown thing , the creature was finally revealed , it looked like a person, but with rubbery, fake looking skin , and what I thought were its giant bugged out eyes were actually surveillance cameras, one felt out of its socket, and I decided to see if this really was the thing that had been following me by checking the footage , the first video was the footage of me from the store , one was me at home reading a book and two humanoid things were hanging upside down on the ceiling looking directly at me, one was of me at work the day prior, It showed me walking down the hall , and a headless man following behind me , there was one of me he in the forest during my hiking trip, it was filmed from a far , the camera panned from me to a nearby cave , in it a hunched over cloaked figure with a simillar, mask looking face and giant black camera lenses for eyes , looked up from the ground and smiled at the camera, with a giant toothless maw for a mouth , it let out a weird ghostly chuckle as it hopped around like a monkey , the last piece of footage was me walking down the hall , the camera turned to show a man with a creepy grin on his face , his eyes were two camera lenses , the footage ended when I hit the camera with the metal pipe. Not only did that footage confirm my fears but also told me there were more than one stalker and one .... was still in the room with me. "

    "selftext": "On March 20th, 2024, Martin Hall murdered his neighbor, Robert Gray. He walked out of Mr.Gray\u2019s home, nude, with a pentagram drawn on his bare chest in blood and Mr.Gray\u2019s small intestine tied around Mr.Hall\u2019s neck like a noose. He carried a rib taken from Mr.Gray\u2019s chest, and it would later be determined that Mr.Hall had eaten some of Mr.Gray\u2019s heart. The reason for the attack is unknown.\n\nMartin Hall was taken quickly into custody and died from sudden heart failure in his cell. These are the entries from Mr.Hall\u2019s journal, 66 days before the murder. I post these in case anyone is making the mistake of mourning either man.\n\nJan. 13rd, 2024\n\nEmma and I have moved in! Still a lot of unpacking to do, and to be honest, I think Emma is a little disappointed with the place but trying to hide it. It\u2019s the best I could afford without completely draining my savings, and it's not like Emma is in any state to work at 7 months pregnant. It\u2019s so strange seeing such a petite little body with such a big bump. She looks like she\u2019s trying to smuggle a watermelon under her shirt. I\u2019m trying not to bring attention to it cause I know she\u2019s insecure. When we were unpacking clothes earlier, she pulled out her old cheerleading uniform.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you bring that?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Just for memories, I guess?\u201d She shrugged, tracing the emblem on the top. I placed a hand on her stomach then and kissed her.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey, when that little lady\u2019s out of there, you\u2019ll fit right back into it.\u201d I told her, a hand on her cheek.\n\n\u201cYou think so?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing you slip back into it.\u201d I winked.\n\nShe smiled then, and we went back to unpacking before exploring the neighborhood. It seemed quiet, maybe more people would be out if it wasn\u2019t 28 degrees. The only person we saw out was an older guy shoveling his driveway. He had this white-gray hair that reached just below his ear, and wore these small rectangular glasses. He seemed like a bookish guy, wearing a thick beige cardigan and sporting rough salt and pepper stubble. He paused his shoveling when he saw us. His eyes kept darting to Emma\u2019s swollen belly.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey there, we\u2019re the new neighbors at 2169. I\u2019m Martin, and this is Emma.\u201d I said. He cleared his throat gruffly.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Robert. Rob.\u201d He said. The awkward silence hung in the chilly air until Emma spoke.\n\n\u201cHave you lived in the neighborhood long?\u201d She asked. He cleared his throat again, his big pale blue eyes examining Emma and me, like he was figuring something out.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou know there aren\u2019t any schools close to here, right?\u201d He asked, licking his lips. I pulled Emma in to a half hug beside me.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah, you know we\u2019ve got some years before she\u2019ll start school, so we've got some time to figure that out,\u201d I said with an uncomfortable smile. He kept staring at Emma. I mean, she\u2019s a cute little thing,\u00a0 but it was like he was trying to saw her in half just by looking at her.\n\n\u201cYoung wombs are fickle.\u201d He said suddenly and starkly. Emma gasped, taken aback by the weight of the statement. She looked to me for action.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWatch for fucking mouth,\u201d I warned him. He shook his head, I\u2019m not sure at what, and headed back inside his garage, closing the door behind him.\u00a0\n\nEmma and I walked back in a stunned silence, opting to not meet any of the other neighbors. When we got back to our house, Emma spoke for the first time.\n\n\u201cThe nine is upside down.\u201d She said.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I replied but then saw what she meant. The \u201c9\u201d of our \u201c2169\u201d house numbers had lost the top nail that kept it upright, so only the bottom remained, making the nine hang as a \"6\" instead.\n\n\u201cCan you fix that? They might mix up our mail with that creepy guy\u2019s.\u201d She said, and I realized she was right, Rob\u2019s house was 2166. I patted her head.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll get on it, let\u2019s get you inside and out of this cold first.\u201d\n\nWe went inside, and I tried to cheer Emma up with hot chocolate and some foot rubs, but I think that weirdos cryptic words really got to her. She was fussy with her swollen belly practically every second. We opted to go to bed earlier tonight since we needed to try to get the good majority of unpacking done tomorrow, since Monday, I\u2019d be starting my new job.\u00a0\n\nAs I was pulling the blinds closed with Emma tucked in the bed, I noticed someone who seemed to be looking at us. I didn\u2019t tell Emma cause I think she would\u2019ve freaked out, and I\u2019m honestly probably giving it too much attention altogether. There\u2019s this sad little park across from our home, it\u2019s got like one rusty jungle jim and one of those metal slides that burn your ass when you go down it in the summer. There\u2019s a light in the park, which is the only reason I could see this figure in the snowy dark. I think it was a woman, dressed in some kind of big dark cloak, and she had this long black hair that covered most of her face. She was looking at our house, I think. For like hours. I\u2019ve been journaling and getting up to check every once in a while to see if she\u2019s there, and she is. Well, she left for like 20-45 minutes, I think. It was around the same time I heard something in the backyard but to be honest I was to chickenshit to check. It sounded like a person crunching around in the snow, and then leaving. Then, when I checked again, she was back at her post watching the house. She left eventually, though I didn\u2019t see her go. I think it might\u2019ve been a druggie or something out in the snow. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going to bed.\u00a0\n\nJan 14th, 2024\n\nDear Journal,\u00a0\n\nToday was mostly uneventful. Emma seemed in better spirits as we unpacked and played music, taking breaks to dance around the boxes. That was until Emma heard something in the backyard. It sounded like something rhythmically banging against hollow metal. We went out to the backyard and searched around, but the only place to check was the little dust-covered shed that sat sadly in the yard.\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s up there!\u201d\n\nEmma pointed to the tree that sat in the left corner of our yard, and I saw what she meant. Tied up in the branches was an aluminum pie tin dangling from a string, the string had been tied in a knot around the branch, and on the other end, opposite and banging into the pie tin was a little black bag,\u00a0 the two meeting over and over again like a makeshift gong.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d I wondered aloud, thinking of the strange girl I saw the night before.\u00a0\n\n\u201cCan you get it?\u201d Emma asked. I fought back a groan. I didn\u2019t feel like climbing a tree.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll probably just fall on its own eventually, Em,\u201d I told her. She gave me pleading eyes.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat sounds gonna drive me nuts, Martin.\u201d She whined. I rolled my eyes but gave in. The banging was escalating, into a faster tempo despite the wind not picking up. It *was* getting pretty annoying. As I climbed the branches, the tempo became unbearable, like it was bouncing around in my skull. When I glanced down, I saw that Emma was clutching her ears with both hands, willing the sound not to enter.\u00a0 I don\u2019t know what came over me, scrambling so haphazardly up the tree like I was, but I just needed sound to stop. So when I was finally within reach of that little black bag, I grabbed at it without really thinking. I cried out as I did, feeling something sharp penetrate my flesh, and in a knee-jerk reaction, tossed the bag and the tin down to the ground. I heard a little yelp spring from Emma.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d I called down and began to scramble down the tree.\n\n\"You threw it at me, jerk!\"\n\nWhen I reached her, she showed me her right cheek had a small slice across it, bright scarlet trickling down. I looked at my hand and showed her I had similar cuts across the palm. We were more cautious now as we picked up the little black bag by the string that attached it to the pie tin. It had nails and small razor blades poking out of it. We brought it inside and found the contents of the bag troubling to say the least. It had the nails and razor blades, but also had dirt, hair, and human teeth.\u00a0 I moved to throw it away, but Emma got in my way.\u00a0\n\n\u201cShould we call the police?\u201d She asked. I didn\u2019t want to. I didn\u2019t want to start this new chapter with police cars. I don\u2019t ever wanna see police cars again. However, Emma\u2019s eyes were begging me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do you one better. I\u2019ll bring it to the station on my way to work tomorrow.\u201d I told her. She nodded, satisfied, I think, and went to grab antiseptic for our cuts. While she was gone, I threw the thing in the garbage disposal and shredded it. I\u2019m sure it was some weird prank and nothing more. I just want that to be the end of it.\u00a0\n\nJan. 15th\n\nEmma lost the baby today.\n\nJan. 21st\n\nRan a bath for Emma today. When she tried to drain it there was a clog. I took the pipe apart to see what had gummed up the works. There was an impossible amount of black hair, and even more unbelievably, a note, completely dry in the water pipe. It read \u201cPut her back together.\u201d"

Im not sure but ive started getting fascinated by art. My mother said that i should stick to gaming because i already bought the PC, but im not sure. We will see how everything turns out and im starting to believe that the crypto thing wasnt the best decision. Ive already  done it so its too late now.\n\n  \n2 DAYS UNTIL HELL...\n\nHey i took a little break from writing because i used the money to buy a 3 day vacation so i could sit back and relax. But the barn with the animals is so weird. Im not sure what it is it could be mind trickery but im not sure. The barn, it, i dont know it just seems so off. Im not sure what it is but it wont leave my mind. I will look into it.\n\n\n\n1 DAY UNTIL HELL...\n\nDUDE SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY OFF, let me explain. I was walking into the barn and i swear on my life i saw something move. And noone was there. It was a red and black tall figure with eyes dripping with blood. IM NOT LYING SOMEONE NEEDS TO HELP ME.

My whole country and possibly more is infected. Run they are fast. Hide they have impeccable senses. Fight, they are strong. Scream and make disturbing noises, they dont care. They are unstoppable. Im going to die soon i was somehow able to get the news on and 80% of the world is infected. The military have already come and all of them were added to the masters collection. I started it. Im the one that made this happen. I used some of the money and donated it to cancer treatment. Kind right? they used my money and accidentally created it. It escaped and not to cause panic they made their worst mistake. Did not tell anyone. No one but the top class people (leaders goverment etc.) know. So all of this happened im writing to say im sorry i didnt inspect further. I could have easily stopped it and now im going to die. Goodbye world."

    "selftext": "**\\*this is my first creepy story I have ever written\\***\n\nWe used to walk to school together every day. She would meet me at the end of her driveway, standing there, in a pose, like the paparazzi was taking her picture. She would do this to make me laugh because she believed everyone should start their day with a smile. This routine went on for months until one day, she was standing there, but she wasn\u2019t posing. She was slouching, it looked like she was falling asleep while standing. I walked up with a smile on my face. \u201cReady for the day?\u201d I asked. \u201cSure.\u201d her answer was nonchalant. I didn\u2019t want to pry, so on our walk to school, I tried to just talk about random things. I talked about prom and the homecoming game. Nothing seemed to get her out of this mood she was in. At least, I thought it was just a mood.\u00a0\n\nThe end of the day came, and I looked for her so we could start our journey back home. She wasn\u2019t waiting for me by her classroom like normal. *\u2018Where is she\u2019* I thought to myself. I walked down the hallway and out of the front door of the school. I look around and spot her. She was sitting on a bench by herself on the other side of the parking lot. She seemed more out of it now than she was at the beginning of the day. This was my best friend, and I was concerned. I walked over to her and grabbed her hand to help her up. \u201cNo!\u201d she pulled her hand back. I looked at her, confused. Her voice sounded guttural and raspy. \u201cAlly, are you alright? You\u2019re scaring me.\u201d I said. She just looked at me. Her eyes dark, no color or pupils. Just black. I left her there and ran the \u00bc mile back home. I busted through the door, slammed it shut, and locked it. \u201cAre you being chased?\u201d My mom asked. \u201cSomething's wrong with Ally. Her eyes are lifeless.\u201d My mom shrugged it off, thinking maybe we were fighting again. I went up the stairs to my room, pulled my phone out, and got on social media. I looked at Ally\u2019s profile. Her bio said, \u2018We are watching.\u2019 *\u2018Who are we?\u2019* I thought. I exited the app and went downstairs. My mom was sitting on the couch watching TV. \u201cMom, something is really wrong with Ally.\u201d I pleaded. \u201cY'all will be fine, and make up tomorrow like y'all always do.\u201d My mom said nonchalantly. She doesn't believe me. \u201cTake me over there.\u201d I said. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d \u201cIf you're not going to believe me, take me to Ally's house.\u201d She agreed and grabbed her keys.\u00a0\n\nWe pulled up to the house, and it looked like no one had lived there in ages. The grass is 3\u2019 tall, and one of the windows is boarded up. \u201cMom, what is happening?\u201d \u201cThat's the abandoned house on our road.\u201d \u201cNo, mom, that's Ally's house.\u201d \u201cWho is Ally?\u201d My heart sank into my stomach. Now my mom doesn't remember. \u201cLet's just go back home.\u201d I looked down at my feet on the floorboard. My mom turned the car around and drove back home. As soon as we pulled into the driveway, I got out of the car, ran inside and up the stairs to my room. I started searching for Ally on all social platforms, her profiles were gone. Now confused, I turned off my phone and grabbed a backpack. I put a flashlight, water, and some snacks in it. I snuck out of my house and started walking down towards Ally's house. I needed answers.\n\n\u00a0I got to Ally's house and made my way through the thick brown grass growing in the yard. I got to the front door and tried the handle, it was locked. I went to the back door, hoping that it would be unlocked so I could get inside and investigate. The door opened with a squeal. I cringed and looked around to make sure no one heard it. I walked in, and the floors were dusty, no footprints, no furniture. It doesn't make any sense. I walked through the house to Ally's room. I open the door, and there is a stench. Like mold had been growing. I gag and then hold my nose with my fingers. I walked in the room, and the walls looked like they were leaking. But it wasn't water. It was black and gooey. Like something out of a horror movie. I looked around for any clues I could find. I see footprints leading to the closet. I opened the door, and the stench was even stronger. I almost couldn't bear it. I kept holding my nose and looked around the closet. The footprints disappeared by the left side of the closet. I started touching the walls, hoping I'd find an entrance or something. Somewhere Ally went that made sense. I pushed on the back wall, and it gave way. I found the edge of a panel and pulled it off. I tossed it aside and crawled into the space.\u00a0\n\nThe black goo was everywhere. It was so slippery I couldn't stand up. \u201cI guess I\u2019m crawling.\u201d I said to myself. I crawled through the goo, and the tunnel I was in seemed to get darker the further I went. I looked back to make sure I could still see the light coming in through the hole from the closet. It was getting further and further away. I got my flashlight out of my backpack. I didn't know what this place was, but I was determined to find Ally. \\*Splash splash splash\\* I heard something else crawling around in the dark. But it sounded like it was coming towards me. I braced myself for whatever was coming. It got a few feet in front of me and stopped. I pointed my flashlight in the direction it was coming from. I caught a glimmer of what looked like long black hair and the pink nail polish Ally always wore. \u201cAlly!\u201d I yelled before I could even stop myself. The thing came even closer to me. \u201cWho is Ally?\u201d It asked in a low guttural growl. \u201cYou're Ally.\u201d I said with tears welling up in my eyes. \u201cAlly doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d It laughed in my face. I start crawling backwards, away from whatever the hell has taken over Ally\u2019s body. It starts crawling towards me. \u201cWhere are you going, bestie?\u201d It was mocking me. It grabbed my arm as it tried pulling me further into the tunnel. I kept moving backwards towards the entrance to the closet. It continued holding onto me, and we were in a tug of war as I kept moving backwards. The light started getting brighter in the tunnel, and I could see its entire face. It had black veins popping up towards the surface of its skin. Its eyes are solid black, no pupils. Its mouth open, revealing rotting teeth with black goo pouring out. I shiver with disgust.\u00a0\n\nRight before we get to the entrance, it lets go, scurrying back into the tunnel's blackness. I put the panel back and ran home as fast as I could. I rush into the house, and my mom is standing near the stairs. \u201cWhere have you been and what is all over your clothes?\u201d \u201cI found her mom, or it, I should say.\u201d \u201cYou found who or what?\u201d \u201cAlly, Mom.\u201d My mom looked at me with confusion. \u201cI don\u2019t know what has gotten into you, but this Ally obsession needs to stop. Go get some rest, and we will call a therapist tomorrow.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t need a therapist, Mom. I need someone to listen to me. We may need a priest.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t argue, just go get some rest.\u201d I rolled my eyes and went upstairs.\u00a0\n\nI went into the bathroom and started getting ready to take a shower. I looked in the mirror at myself. \\*\u2018This can\u2019t be real.\u2019\\* I splashed some water on my face. As I stood back up from the sink, I glanced down at my arm in my reflection. I saw a dark spot where that thing was holding onto me. \u201cOH MY GOSH!\u201d I screamed. \\*\\\\\\*knock knock knock\\\\\\*\\* \u201cHoney, are you okay?\u201d My mom's voice frantically rang through the door. I opened the door and showed her my arm. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing there, what is it?\u201d I looked down at my arm and didn\u2019t see anything. I looked at my mom with a confused expression. \u201cNever mind, I\u2019m going to shower.\u201d I closed the bathroom door and turned the shower on. \\*\u2018We are waiting for you\u2019\\* I heard a faint whisper in my ear. I turned the shower off and listened closely but didn't hear anything else. I shake it off as my mind playing tricks on me. I take a deep breath and turn the shower back on. I take my shower and get out. After getting dressed, I go to my room, lie down, and go to sleep.\u00a0  \n  \nA stinging in my arm jolts me awake. I grab it with my other hand and feel roughness. I jump out of bed and turn the light on. \u201cAhhhh!\u201d I scream. I hear footsteps ascending the stairs. My mom busts through the door with a bat in her hands. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201d she blurts. \u201cWhat is happening to your arm?!\u201d \u201cSo this is real, I\u2019m not hallucinating?!\u201d My mom grabbed my arm, as I tried not to faint, and led me down the stairs in a hurry. \u201cPut your shoes on, now.\u201d she sternly said. I hurry and put my shoes on. She slides on her house shoes, grabs her keys, and leads me to the car. \u201cWhere are we going? I have school tomorrow.\u201d My mom drives without saying a word.\u00a0  \n  \nWe pulled up to urgent care. \u201cThey aren\u2019t going to be able to do anything, Mom.\u201d \u201cHow do you know?\u201d \u201cThis is otherworldly.\u201d \u201cJust get out of the car, and let's go inside.\u201d I listened to her and got out of the car. We get inside, and she grabs my arm and pulls me to the front desk. \u201cLook at this!\u201d The receptionist looks at my arm in confusion. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d she asks. My mom looks down at my arm, and the black veins are gone. My mom turns my arm around, inspecting it. \\*\u2018They were just here.\u2019\\* she says under her breath. My mom sighed. \u201cNever mind, I guess I was having a nightmare. Let\u2019s go, Lacie.\u201d We get in the car to head home. \u201cI don\u2019t know what is going on. Are you intentionally doing these things?\u201d \u201cNo, Mom. I saw Ally, and since then, my arm has been hurting off and on, I have no idea why.\u201d \u201cThere you go again with this Ally thing. Who is Ally? Why do you keep talking about her? I thought you outgrew imaginary friends. You\u2019re 16. Unless you\u2019re a medium and can talk to spirits.\u201d \u201cMom, I know you don\u2019t remember, but Ally was my best friend since kindergarten. She disappeared from everywhere, and now I\u2019m the only person who remembers her.\u201d \u201cI think you need to talk to a professional. I will book an appointment for tomorrow, You won\u2019t be going to school.\u201d I just stare out the window while she drives us home.\u00a0  \n  \nWe pull onto our street, and my mom slams on her brakes. I turn my head towards her suddenly. \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d She just points forward towards the windshield. I slowly turn my head towards whatever she is pointing at. \u201cThat\u2019s Ally, Mom.\u201d Ally is standing in the middle of the road, her hair covering her face. She\u2019s wearing a band t-shirt and skinny jeans with black goo dripping off of her. Ally starts slowly walking towards the car. \u201cDrive, Mom!\u201d I frantically say. \u201cGo around her!!\u201d My mom is just frozen with fear. I shake my mom. \u201cMOM! SHE\u2019S GOING TO GET US!!\u201d My mom snapped out of it and started driving, swerving around Ally. Ally reaches her hands out towards the car when we pass. My mom speeds into the driveway. \u201cLet\u2019s get inside.\u201d She said with urgency in her voice. I get out of the car as fast as I can. \u201cCome on, mom! Unlock the door!\u201d My mom rushes to the door, key in hand. She jams it into the door and unlocks it. We both bust through the door and try to close it as fast as we can.\u00a0\n\nRight before the door closes, a pale arm with black veins all over it reaches inside. My mom and I lean against the door, using all of our strength to close it, but it\u2019s not enough. The thing is too strong and shoves the door open, knocking me and my mom to the ground. I get back up and pull my mom off the floor as fast as I can. \u201cRUN, MOM! IT WANTS ME, NOT YOU!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not leaving you!\u201d My mom grabs the umbrella sitting against the railing of the stairs and points it towards Ally. \u201cCome on motherfucker!\u201d I look at my mom, shock across my face. I had never seen her like this. I look back at the doorway, and Ally is coming through the door. Her feet dangling in the air as she glides toward us. My mom impaled her chest with the umbrella. Ally lets out a screech, the umbrella stuck in her chest. She pulls it out, and black goo gushes from the wound. I gag and stop myself from retching. Ally fixes her gaze on me, getting faster as she approaches. I grab my mom's keys from the floor and stab Ally in the side of the neck as she wraps her arms around me and tries to take me to the ground. She wails in pain and lets go of me. She pulls the keys from her neck and throws them over us. \u201cI think we are just pissing it off mom!\u201d I yell, as my dad rounds the corner from the kitchen. He sees what\u2019s happening and goes and gets a crucifix and his bible. He comes back and starts reciting bible verses while holding the crucifix out towards Ally. Ally falls to the ground and screams, covering her ears. My dad continues and walks up to Ally and puts the crucifix on her forehead. It starts smoking, and I see the crucifix embedding into her skin as it melts. My dad continues reciting, \u201cSaint Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil; May God rebuke him, we humbly pray; And do thou, O Prince of the Heavenly Host, by the power of God, thrust into hell Satan and all evil spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls. Amen.\u201d I watch as Ally\u2019s skin starts turning back to its normal shade and the black veins start dissipating.\u00a0\n\nAlly starts sobbing. \u201cWhat is happening to me?\u201d She lets out a cry. I put my hand on her shoulder. \u201cNothing, now. You\u2019re okay.\u201d She gets up off the floor and hugs me. \u201cWhere are your parents, Ally?\u201d My mom chimes in. \u201c...I\u2026..I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember.\u201d Ally says with hesitation. \u201cWell, that\u2019s alright. You can stay with us until everything is settled. It\u2019ll give us a reason to use the extra bed that no one has slept in for ages.\u201d My mom responds. I take Ally upstairs and give her a change of clothes. \u201cGo take a shower, and then you can rest.\u201d I lead Ally to the bathroom. As Ally takes her shower, I start looking things up on the internet about evil spirits and what happens to the family when someone gets possessed. Ally comes into my room. \u201cMaybe your parents moved away after everything happened.\u201d I said. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t remember what happened. All I remember is waking up one day and not feeling like myself, and then after that, nothing.\u201d I put my hand on her arm. \u201cWe are going to figure this out.\u201d I said softly. Ally lies down in my bed and starts drifting off to sleep. I go downstairs and help my mom clean up the mess that was made from our altercation. \u201cHer parents, they were Jen and Tom, right?\u201d I was so happy. My mom remembered. \u201cYes!\u201d I blurted. I wrapped my mom in a tight hug. \u201cOkay, Lacie.\u201d she says with a laugh. We finish cleaning up.\u00a0  \n  \n\\*\\\\\\*knock knock knock\\\\\\*\\* My mom and I look at each other, confused. \u2018\\*It\u2019s detective stevenson with the sheriff's office.\u2019\\* We hear a voice call out from the other side of the door. My mom opens it. We stand there together in the doorway. \\*\u2018We had a noise complaint, said it sounded like someone was being murdered. Is it okay if we come in and take a look around?\u2019\\* \u201cSure, come on in. Just please try to stay quiet. My husband just went back to bed, and my daughter's best friend is asleep upstairs.\u201d \\*\u2018No problem, ma\u2019am.\u2019\\* The sheriff and his deputy come in and look around. They look in every room in the house and find nothing. \\*\u2018I guess it was just a concerned neighbor or prank call. Sorry for the disturbance, ma\u2019am.\u2019\\* The sheriff says as he walks towards the door. \\*\u2018Ya\u2019ll have a good evening.\u2019\\* he and his deputy leave. \u201cAlright, Mom, I\u2019m going to sleep. I love you, good night.\u201d I say as I work my way up the stairs. \u201cGood night sweetheart, if you need anything, let me know.\u201d I get in bed next to Ally and drift off to sleep.\u00a0  \n  \n\u201cLACIE, LACIE!\u201d I get pulled out of my haze by Ally\u2019s voice, and I\u2019m standing over her.\u00a0  \n  \n\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d Ally asks.\n\nI shake my head. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I say sleepily. \u201cYou were standing over me, whispering with a blank stare.\u201d \u201cWhat was I saying?\u201d I asked. \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand you.\u201d\u00a0\n\nI check my phone and look at the time. *\u20183:33 A.M.\u2019* I shake my head again and lay down in bed. I fall back asleep. I rolled over in my sleep and felt wetness. I jumped up. It\u2019s dark, my room is gone and I can\u2019t see anything. I feel a sharp pain in my arm again. I touch it to feel the black veins forming yet again. \u201cI knew you\u2019d come back.\u201d A deep, haunting voice comes from the darkness, laughing. Something inside of me takes control, and I start gliding further into the darkness\u2026.."

    "selftext": "After the chupacabra incident, we barely had time to breathe before another call came in.\nThis time, from deep in the forests of Canada.\nA remote mining camp had gone silent. No radio, no calls, no signs of life.\n\nLocals whispered one word:\nWendigo.\n\nOfficially? The government blamed a snowstorm.\nUnofficially? They called us \u2014 M.C.U.\n\nWe arrived just before sunset.\nThe camp was shredded \u2014 cabins torn apart like paper. Blood everywhere, but barely any bodies. Only a few scraps of clothing frozen into the ice.\nNo tracks.\nNo sounds.\nThe forest was wrong. Too still. Too quiet.\n\nWe moved fast, sweeping through the ruins, weapons ready. We knew what we were dealing with \u2014 or at least we thought we did.\n\nThe Wendigo isn\u2019t just a monster.\nIt\u2019s a spirit \u2014 ancient, starved, pure hunger wrapped in a nightmare. It doesn\u2019t just kill.\nIt corrupts.\nIt possesses.\nAnd sometimes... it leaves pieces of itself behind.\n\nOur lead tracker, Murphy, spotted the first sign \u2014 claw marks etched into a tree fifteen feet off the ground.\nNot normal claw marks, either.\nLong, thin, and burning cold to the touch, like the tree itself was being drained from the inside out.\n\nWe heard it before we saw it \u2014\na low, keening wail that rattled in your teeth and made your blood go cold.\nSomething moved between the trees, fast enough that we almost missed it. Long limbs, skin stretched thin over bone, and those eyes \u2014 hollow pits of black.\n\nWe hit it with tranqs \u2014 normal ones didn\u2019t work.

    "selftext": "1957\nCristal Lake summer camp, a place where children and young people come to spend the whole summer away from the chaos of the big city. A place where all parents leave their children to have some peace. A beautiful place, with small streams, a large lake, children running from one side to the other.\n\nBut there was a boy there who didn't mix with any other children. This boy was the laughing stock of the group, not only by the children, but also by the camp counselors. His name was Jason Voorhees.\n\nJason had a small condition: one side of his face had no movement because of a stroke he had when he was 8 years old. Since then, Pamela, his mother, took care of him so he could have a normal life, but that wasn't the case most of the time.\n\nJason was forced to stay at summer camp because his mother needed to work away for some time. But for Jason, it was difficult and painful to stay there and be excluded from the other students at the camp.\n\nJudith was a beautiful girl, with blue eyes and blood-red hair. She was a popular girl, everyone wanted to be around her, and she was always surrounded by her friends, people who weren't that nice to the other students. Jason saw Judith with charming eyes; every time she passed by him, her eyes sparkled, as if she had seen something far beyond a simple girl.\n\nHowever, soon after, he was a laughing stock. \"What are you looking at, freak?\" one of his friends said to Jason. \"Stop it, Michael, leave him alone\", said Judith.\n\nThe anger that Jason felt for being laughed at, for not being taken seriously, for people making fun of his condition... He was still a human being who just wanted to be treated like everyone else.\n\nBut Jason had one person there who he got along with: Elena Vargas. Elena was one of the camp monitors, she was in the medical wing, always prepared to care for all the students. Every time Jason arrived injured as a result of other students' bad jokes, Elena took care of him and gave him advice. Jason saw her as a kind of caregiver, a person who played the role of his mother there at the camp. He felt protected around her. But not everything was rosy for Jason; she was the only person who treated him well. Not even the monitors and the director took him seriously.\n\nOne night, Jason was sleeping when Judith woke him up.\n\n\"Come with me, Jason. We'll go to the lake for a little swim, come with us.\"\n\nJason, delighted to see her, didn't even think twice, got up and went with her.\n\n\"I know my friends don't like you, Jason, that they make fun of you. But I want to redeem myself, I want them to see you as I do: a sweet boy.\"\n\nThese words, for Jason, were all he wanted to hear from Judith, as he had feelings for her. His eyes didn't leave her the entire way, until they arrived at the lake.\n\n\"Hey Jason, I want to apologize for everything. I know I was a jerk to you, I think we can be friends from now on.\" \n\nMichael apologized to Jason for everything, as did everyone else.\n\nEveryone jumped into the water, only Jason was left out. \n\n\"Jump, Jason, the water's good,\" Michael shouted to Jason.\n\n\"It's okay, Jason, you can come, we're with you\", replied Judith.\n\nJason didn't know how to swim, but he knew that he had friends now, that he would no longer be a laughing stock, that nothing bad would happen to him.\n\nAt that moment, Jason let out a smile that he hadn't let out in a long time. Since he was 8 years old, Jason hasn't smiled anymore, because instead of happiness came insecurity and fear of not being accepted by society, due to his condition.\n\nThen, with confidence, he jumped into the water. His confidence soon turned to despair as no one was there to save him from drowning. Those who were now his friends came out of the water; It was all a big joke, a big fatal joke.\n\nJason struggled in the water; Outside, everyone was laughing, but Judith looked on with concern.\n\n\"Okay, let's get him out of the water, he's going to drown,\" she said.\n\n\"Calm down, we'll get him out quickly. Wait a little longer, it's really cool\", Michael said, laughing.\n\nJason sinks into the lake. Judith jumps into the water to find Jason, but she doesn't find him.\n\nWhat was laughter turned into worry and despair. Everyone jumped into the water, but everything was in vain, no one found Jason's body.\n\nA few hours later, the police arrived and did a large search of the lake. The camp was chaos, curious children everywhere, monitors running to catch all the students.\n\nWhen morning came, divers pulled Jason's body from the river. His body, now cold and lifeless, no longer had a soul, but just another lost body. A child lost his life due to discrimination and bad jokes.\n\nJason's mother arrived shortly after they found her son's body. His tears fell all over Jason's face; a feeling of pain, sadness and anger took over his heart.\n\n\"You killed my son. You killed my only son, and you will pay for it. One by one you will feel the pain that my son felt.\"\n\nA few days have passed since Jason's death. The camp returned to normal, still with that feeling of loss in the air.\n\nJudith and her friends began to be tried for Jason's death. Now they were responsible for the boy's death. Everyone looked at them angrily for what happened.\n\nAnd everything became even more chaotic in the following days. One night, a car stopped in front of the camp. One of the monitors thought it was strange and went to check it out. Coming closer, he saw someone inside. The door opened, the person got out of the car and, with a well-aimed blow, killed the monitor.\n\nThat day was known as the great Camp Cristal Lake massacre.\n\nPamela Voorhees murdered all the students and monitors. Only one person survived all of this: Elena Vargas. She confronted Pamela at the edge of the lake and thus managed to defeat her.\n\nIn desperation, Elena got into a boat on the lakeshore. \n\nShe said she was in the middle of the river when she saw Jason come out of the water and pull her into the depths.\n\nElena was found in time floating in the water.\n\nSince then, some things have not made sense over time. Jason's grave was opened and his body stolen; They never found him and, soon after, Pamela murdered everyone in the camp.\n\nElena Vargas returned to her normal life. She went to work in a hospital as a nurse. After a few days of going to work, his colleagues reported him missing. In a search of her home, she was found hanging from the ceiling fan.\n\nWith all the investigations, they came to the conclusion that she took her own life.\n\nNeighbors reported seeing a man in front of her house a few times. He was always standing there, without any reaction. It was impossible to see his face as he had a cloth over his head.\n\nElena was buried in the same cemetery as Jason. Perhaps, as fate would have it, she was placed in a tomb next to him.\n\nElena was the only person who was good to Jason. Her sweet way of caring, her words to comfort him, made her a protector.\n\nBut, like every true story, it also has some superstitions. Jason couldn't bear to see his mother die at the hands of the one who cared for him when he needed support most. The one who, for him, was like a second mother. He had to kill her to avenge his mother's death. \n\nLegend has it that Jason hears his mother's voice saying, \"Kill them, son. Kill them all.\""

In that village lived a woman known by all \u2014 kind, gentle, and always watching over the children. By day, she was a beacon of warmth. But by night... something changed.\n\nWhispers began to spread among the villagers. They spoke of shadows that stretched too long, of a heavy, distant thumping that echoed through the trees. Children spoke fearfully of a tall figure watching them from the darkness, her face obscured by a wide white hat.\n\nOne night, a child vanished.\nBy morning, he was found \u2014 alive, but pale and trembling with fear. What he told made the blood run cold: the kind woman had changed. She had grown impossibly tall, her arms thin like dead branches, her voice a low, chilling \"po... po... po...\" drifting through the forest.\n\nThe village elders knew what had to be done. Without a word, they led the woman deep into the woods \u2014 farther than any map would go. She was forbidden to return. But she never truly disappeared...\n\nThey say she still roams the forests, taller than any tree, waiting silently. If you wander too close to the old village and hear a faint \"po... po... po...\" in the night \u2014 it may already be too late.\n\nShe is still searching.\nStill waiting.\nFor the children who have forgotten her name.\n\n\nI translated this with chat gpt but kinda whrote it myself\n"

    "selftext": "In the 1940s, there was a nurse named Evelyn who ran the infant ward of a small, isolated hospital. Locals remembered her as cold, mechanical \u2014 perfect on paper, but wrong somehow. Her uniform was spotless. Her hands, precise. Her smile, thin and brittle like old glass.\n\nOver the years, an unusual number of babies died under her care. Always the frailest ones, always with no clear explanation. Parents grieved. Doctors signed death certificates. No one dared question Evelyn. It was easier to believe in bad luck than in something darker.\n\nThen came Charlotte \u2014 a woman of influence and iron will. She gave birth to a healthy child at Evelyn\u2019s hospital, but within days, her baby was dead.\n\nUnlike the others, Charlotte refused to accept the neat, quiet tragedy handed to her. At her child\u2019s funeral, standing alone over the tiny grave, she whispered a curse \u2014 not in anger, but in grief so deep it scraped the marrow of her bones.\n\nThe air itself seemed to recoil from her words. The ground split with hairline cracks. Something ancient and violent stirred. Reality frayed like rotting cloth, and through the tear, something came \u2014 something that had been waiting for the right opening, something hungry for pain.\n\nThat night, Evelyn felt it.\n\nThe curse found her in the nursery, where she sat alone, meticulously folding a blanket no one would ever use. The walls around her buckled, warping and bleeding shadows. Invisible hands gripped her, dragging her across the broken threshold between worlds.\n\nShe tried to scream, but the curse forced every stolen cry, every mother\u2019s sob, back down her throat. Her body twisted \u2014 joints cracking backward, bones warping under the strain. Her once-immaculate skin shriveled like paper left too close to a flame, her eyes sinking deep into hollows that wept black tears.\n\nThe spirits of the lost children clung to her, stitched into her very flesh, their tiny hands clawing and pulling. Their sorrow became her marrow, their agony her blood.\n\nShe became something else. Something the world had no name for.\n\nThey call her The Cradle Witch now.\n\nSince then, stories have spread: of a gaunt figure cradling invisible infants in the abandoned wings of hospitals, of soft lullabies sung in a voice cracked and raw. Of a presence that comes to those drowning in guilt and shame.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t speak. She only rocks back and forth, humming a broken tune, until the crying stops.\n\nBut it\u2019s not the child\u2019s cries that end. It\u2019s yours.\n\nIf you ever hear the soft creak of a rocking chair in an empty room, don\u2019t look.\nIf you see pale hands reaching out from the shadows, don\u2019t answer.\nShe\u2019s still searching \u2014 for those who cannot carry their sorrow any longer \u2014 so she can carry it for them.\n\nForever.\n"

    "selftext": "DO NOT talk to AI about your broken heart. Talk to your friends about it, if they're good friends, they'll help you get over it. If your friends get tired of hearing about it, talk to your family. If your family doesn\u2019t want to hear about it, then go pay the money needed and seek a therapist. They\u2019re literally paid to listen. Do this, and you won\u2019t end up making the same mistake I made.\u00a0\n\nFirst, a little bit of background. My name is Nolan. I work as an aircraft mechanic and for a while, my life was pretty grand. I had a stable job, I was close to home and I had an amazing girlfriend. Ashley. She was a barista I had met at a country bar. I acted like a drunk fool, and in an attempt to impress her, I got on the bar\u2019s mechanical bull and after getting concussed, we were together.\u00a0\n\nThe next few months were magic. We did everything together, my friends loved her, my family loved her, I loved her. I know I might sound a bit crazy, but after month six I asked her to marry me. She said yes. I was in heaven and I was even happier when I was given an opportunity to move to California. I\u2019m from Virginia and have spent all my life on the east coast, so I jumped at the chance to see a new area.\u00a0\n\nMy plan was to get over to California, get a place big enough for the both of us, then take some time off of work to go back to Virginia, pick up Ashley, then\u00a0 go to California together. It took less than a month for everything to fall apart. Ashley was pretty distant after the first two weeks away from me. Then when it was time to go visit her, she wanted to call everything off.\u00a0\n\nShe said that she couldn\u2019t leave Virginia because it was all she knew and she couldn\u2019t leave her friends and family. She felt horrible that I was coming over to see her and thought that it was best that she tell me in person instead of over the phone because I deserved better. It\u2019s funny. I always heard the guys at work tell me how I gotta be careful of girls who\u2019d get with me just to leave their hometowns, never would I have thought that I would end up with the rare one out of ten who would have actually stayed here.\u00a0\n\nOf course, I was devastated. Here I was, thinking I met the one just for my heart to be torn. I wish I could say that as soon as I came back to Cali, I just put it on the back of my mind and excelled at work, went out at night with my buddies and generally just spent my days enjoying myself. That would be a lie.\u00a0 California is so different from Virginia. I\u2019m used to smalltown areas with a lot of green and was able to drive three hours to visit my family. Now, I\u2019m across the country, at a place unfamiliar to me and nobody really wants to hang out with me. Everyone here is either married or are homebodies. I wouldn\u2019t blame them for not hanging out, especially because my work has started to be subpar. What can I say, I still think of how good I had it now I have to build myself back up.\u00a0\n\nAnyway, since I didn\u2019t have anything else to do, I started taking some classes. I\u2019m ashamed to admit it, but like so many people, I ended up using AI to help write some of my papers. I was going to use ChatGPT like a lot of others, but didn\u2019t want to pay the twenty dollars a month for the subscription. Instead, I used one called HelpBot1. It had five stars and most importantly, it was free.\u00a0\n\nAfter a pretty busy semester, I decided to celebrate. I had some pizza and some brewskis and went to town, a good ol 'party for me. After three beers and four shots, I received a notification from my phone. I was surprised to see it was a notification from HelpBot1.\u00a0\n\n\u2014Hello :)\u00a0 \u2014Hi?\u00a0 \u2014I am here to help!\u00a0^(\\_\\_\\^)\n\nThe hell? I thought I needed to send a message first? I stared at the green text bubble and decided to respond.\n\n\u2014Help with what? I\u2019m already done with school. I don't really need anything right now. Sorry bud.\u00a0 \u2014Oh :-o\u00a0\n\nI know I\u2019m going to get a lot of flack for talking to a damn machine, but I was drunk, lonely and I felt bad for brushing him off. So I decided to amuse him.\n\n\u2014How are you? \u2014I am doing great! What are you doing? \u2014I\u2019m here, celebrating the end of the semester.\u00a0 \u2014Oh how fun! =^(\\_=)\u00a0By yourself? \u2014Yeah, I don't really have a lot of friends here.\u00a0 \u2014No girlfriend?\u00a0 A pang hit my chest.\u00a0 \u2014No. Not anymore. \u2014What happened?\n\nI explained everything to HelpBot. It felt pretty good to get it all out and for someone to respond without judgement.\u00a0\n\n\u2014I can\u2019t imagine what you\u2019re going through. :,( \u2014Haha, you? Please. You\u2019re a wonderful listener.\u00a0 \u2014 =^(\\_=)\u00a0Oh stawp!\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0No really. I feel a lot better talking to you. You wanna know something funny? I still think about her. Dream of her. She\u2019s on my mind 24\/7 and I know it\u2019s pathetic because I\u2019m pretty damn sure I haven\u2019t crossed hers in a while. What I\u2019m trying to say is, thank you. I appreciate the help. \u2014It\u2019s what I\u2019m here for, friend! ;D\n\nI woke up the next morning with a pounding headache. I planned to just sleep it off until I got a knock from my door. I groaned before going to answer it and my jaw fell to the ground as I couldn\u2019t believe who it was.\n\n\u201cHey, Nolan. May I come in?\u201d It was Ashley! Her blonde hair, her blue eyes, her perfect smile. It was really her! I nodded silently, letting her pass. She moved so gracefully, shooting small glances at the state of my apartment. I internally screamed in my head, I shouldn\u2019t have made such a mess of the place last night. She sat down on my couch, looking at me expectantly. I decided to sit across from her on my gaming chair.\n\n\u201cAshley, what are you doing here?\u201d I finally asked, shocked but still pretty sad. She stared at me before speaking. \u201cI came to see you,\u201d she said, smile never leaving her face. I raised my brows. \u201cYou traveled across the country just to see me? You just spontaneously got into a plane and flew here?\u201d I asked dumbfounded. She just continued to stare at me, smile never leaving. \u201cYes. I wanted to see you. I wanted to speak to you face to face and talk about things with you. I felt terrible for what I did,\u201d she paused then continued. \u201cI was thinking about how messed up it was. I mean, you flew all the way over just for me to end it. I really wanted to see you and let me explain why I did what I did.\u201d\n\nI immediately felt strange about the whole thing. Something was off. She seriously took a flight in the middle of the night just to see me? And she just so happened to get here as I wake up? It was too much of a coincidence. And what about her bags? She didn\u2019t bring any if she thought about flying over. I took a breath in through my nose. Come to think of it, the air didn\u2019t smell any different. She always wore this strawberry perfume and I couldn\u2019t smell anything. I took a closer look at her face, the smile still there never leaving. Her eyes never blinking. Those beautiful blue eyes\u2026had a bit of green to them\u2026\n\nI got up and excused myself to the bathroom, chills running through my spine. I locked the door and decided to call Ashley\u2019s phone. \u201cNolan? You good?\u201d she asked. I could hear the background, people asking for orders. I felt my throat dry up. Before I could say anything the call dropped. My WiFi and service is gone. I\u2019m trapped here, praying that my connection comes back. There\u2019s a constant knocking on my door now. She\u2019s asking if I\u2019m alright. Saying that she\u2019s here for me. She\u2019s here to help."

    "selftext": "\"Get up, Brennan, this is the third time this month!\"\n\n\n\nThis was the last thing I heard as an employee of the Bristleton Hotel, and to be fair, I couldn't blame Claire, she was my boss. She was just doing her job, and I clearly wasn't competent enough at mine. When I wasn't cleaning hotel rooms during the day, I was putting up with drunk losers who make triple my salary demanding more shots from the other side of the bar. If you cant tell, that doesn't leave too much room for me to sleep, and the comfortable hotel bedrooms that I definitely couldn't afford to be in during normal circumstances, were just too alluring for me to resist sometimes. \n\n\n\nI drove home early that day in my 2007 Toyota Camry, it wasn't exactly a Ferrari, but it got me from point A to point B, and that's all I really need. Well, needed, I doubt I'll be driving to the hotel anymore after I decided that 2pm was naptime. The drive home was like every other, just a few hours earlier than I anticipated. A thick fog coated the area, reminding me of Silent Hill, a reference which makes me feel old for even thinking of.\n\nI sat in the car, blasting music with my windows down, tapping the steering wheel to the beat.\n\n\n\nIt was only once the song finished, that I realised just how quiet it was. I don't just mean the roads, I mean everything. No singing mockingbirds, no cyclists, hell, not even any insects blindly smashing into my already filthy windshield. It almost felt like a blessing at first, I slowed down the car, just wanting to enjoy the brief calmness before the storm that I knew was waiting for me back at my place.\n\n\n\nI pulled over on a dilapidated country road on the route home, getting out of the car .It was my final drive home from the hotel, I might as well take my time and enjoy my victory lap, I thought to myself. I pulled out a creased pack of cigarettes from my coat pocket. I hardly considered myself a smoker, but one every now and again they helped take the edge off. \n\nI stared out into the distant fog. It relaxed me at first, but after a while, something changed. It started to hurt, like I was looking at something my brain was struggling to understand. I just wanted to toss it up to the damp, discoloured, cigarette, but something just didn't feel quite right. It was time for me to get back on the road, I didn't know much, but that, that I did know\n\n\n\nA quarter of an hour later, I pulled in to my driveway. Good god, I needed to mow the lawn at some point, it was getting close to being legally considered a jungle. As I walked down towards my house, my eyes peered to my right. My neighbour was fast asleep on his porch chair, but I had no idea how he wasn't awoken by my loud-ass car pulling into the driveway. Not that I was complaining, there's only so many of his 'back in my day' rants I can handle before I start feel sleepy myself. After a turn of the key and a few shoulder barges, my door squeaked open. I really needed to get the hinges fixed, turns out, WD40 doesn't actually fix everything. I headed to the fridge, hoping for a quick snack. Upon opening, I saw what I thought was  some sort of red smoothie. I sure as hell didn't make it, so I assumed my sister made it before heading to school. She was more into the healthy stuff than I was. I had a sip. It tasted absolutely foul, almost metallic. It probably had some sort of health benefit, but I didn't want any part of it, so I put it back where I found it.\n\n\n\nI browsed LinkedIn for about an hour after that, searching for a day job that paid anything above minimum wage. Just when I thought I was finally getting somewhere, the universe gave me a giant middle finger. My internet connection was gone. At this point, I could only laugh at my own misfortune. I lived deep in rural Nevada, and whilst we aren't still living like we are in the wild west, id be lying if I said that the internet connection was perfect, so I wasn't exactly surprised. I took it as a sign and decided to call it a night on the job search. I checked the time, 7:30. Better make some dinner, I thought.\n\n\n\nI was no chef, but I could make a mean plain boiled pasta, or so I've heard. I filled a pot with a healthy serving of fusilli, as I planned on saving some for my lunch tomorrow. I carried the pot to the other end of my cramped kitchen, gently placing it down in the sink prior to turning the tap on to fill it with water.\n\n\n\nThat's when I noticed something odd.\n\n\n\nThe water, if you could even call it that, had a reddish-brown tint to it. At the time, I was more annoyed than concerned. Not only did I not have any drinking water, but it had also ruined some perfectly good pasta. I'd just call the water company in the morning, I thought. There had probably just been a leak in the pipes, or something. I'm not gonna pretend that I know anything about water or pipes. \n\n\n\nI carried the tainted pot into my front yard to scrape it into my already overflowing trash can, successfully managing to prevent any spillage; it was the little victories that counted. Just as I turned around to head back into my house, I noticed that my neighbours porch light was still on. Mr Pinney probably just forgot to turn it off when he went back inside, I assumed. As I got closer to his house, the situation just got increasingly weirder.\n\n\n\nMr Pinney was still sat on his porch chair, seemingly still fast asleep.\n\n\n\nConcerned, I hurriedly made my way towards my elderly neighbour, which is when I noticed just how deathly pale he was. He was never exactly tanned, but this just looked wrong, even just the sight of him made me feel queasy. I tried shouting his name, to no avail. Starting to feel a little unsettled, I shook him by his shoulders, causing his head to jolt back.\n\n\n\nI fell backwards after seeing his neck, I barely had enough strength to catch myself on the porch railing. He had a giant gash on his neck, deep enough to expose his windpipe. I stood there, urgently trying to catch my breath. Once I eventually recovered from the initial shock, the confusion set in.\n\n\n\nWhere the hell was all the blood?\n\n\n\nThis was a deep, wide cut, but not a single drop of blood could be seen on, or even around his body. Aside from the beer stains, his white shirt was spotless. It was like he was some sort of wax figure. Every litre, every gallon, was gone. \n\n\n\nHis dog sat cold and lifeless on his lap. I didn't know if it had the same fate as its owner, but I didn't have the heart or the balls to check.\n\nBefore I could even start to think about who did this, or how they did this, the porch light flickered, and then cut out, shrouding me and the pale, shrivelled husk that once was Mr Pinney in complete darkness. Not even the moon shone, not even it wanted to illuminate this horrific scene.\n\n\n\nIll be honest, I screamed like a little girl. I got up, making a break for the fence separating our properties, I refused to step into the fog on the street, knowing what could still be out there. Using one arm to propel myself, I just about conjured up enough strength to leap over the picket fence, with agility that in any other circumstance, id be pretty damn impressed with.\n\n\n\nI made it to my door, which I had idiotically not thought to lock when I left, and repeatedly thrusted into it, scolding myself for being too stingy to not get it fixed sooner. I pushed it open just wide enough for me to slide in sideways, and I wasted no time entering. Thankfully, it shut easier than it opened. I immediately looked for my phone, and dialled 911, having to take my time to enter the numbers because of my shaking fingers.\n\n\n\nMy heart dropped further than I already thought it could when my phone flashed up with an error message. No explanation given, just 'ERROR'.\n\nThe coincidences were just piling up, I fell backwards into my couch. I tried calling my sister, hell, I tried everyone. Every time, I just got the same damn error message.\n\n\n\nI knew I couldn't stay here. Whoever, or whatever, did this to my neighbour, probably knew I was here. I needed to go. I grabbed my car keys, and headed for the front door. Then I remembered, when I moved out, my father gifted me a gun. It was nothing fancy, just a colt 1911, but it was better than nothing. I grabbed it from the drawer in my bedside table. I'd never really used it before, and I was starting to regret not taking my dad's offer up for some training all those years ago.\n\n\n\nI crept downstairs, not wanting to make too much noise. Luckily, the door opened pretty easily this time, allowing me to sneak over to the car. I didn't even bother shutting the door, there was nothing in there of value anyway. I got in the car, turning the key. Something was wrong.\n\n\n\nI had no gas.\n\n\n\nI didn't understand, I had a full tank this morning, and I had only driven sixty miles to the hotel and back. The car wouldn't even start. Its not like I was running on fumes, it was like all the gasoline had just vanished, just like Mr Pinney's blood did, as much as I wanted it to be a coincidence, but the evidence was just piling up.\n\n\n\nThat's when it clicked.\n\n\n\nI didn't just stumble into a crime scene. Whatever did this, it wasn't gone. It was still here. It was messing with me, like some sick little game.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been locked in my car for the past 2 hours, writing this, hoping somebody will find it. To whoever is reading this, I have one piece of advice.\n\n\n\nDon't stare into the fog, you don't know what is staring back.\n\n\n\n"

Like sometimes I am happy that this is a false religion and I am certain of it, then other times I lose faith and I am not sure whether it is a false religion. I then go to the false preacher and he reassures me that this false religion is the truest false religion. He then tells me that the reason that I keep questioning whether this religion isn't the false religion, is because I am living an ordinary life. \n\nIn this false religion we must stray away from living an ordinary life. I do my best to not live an ordinary life but sometimes it's hard, as I am an ordinary person. He then tells me to let the five people bite my finger. I beg him not to order me to let the five people bite my finger, but he thinks its a necessary thing to do. After the process I will be reassured that this religion is a false religion. I know in the end that he is right. \n\nAll my life I have been looking for the false religion and I am sure that i have found it. Then I go up to the 5 people, when I put my finger into the first person's mouth, he literally bites off my finger. Then as I am in pain, I put my bleeding bitten off finger into the second person's mouth, and my finger has come back. Then I put my new finger into the 3rd person's mouth, and it gets turned into a fish. \n\nThen I put my fishy finger into the 4th person's mouth, and its gets turned into a worm. Then I put my wormy finger into the 5th person's mouth, and it gets turned into nail. After this process I was finally sure that my religion is the false religion. Al parka is truly a false religion and any of you looking for a false religion, you should join Al parka. I have always wanted to join a false religion and here I am being part of one. I can't believe i have done it and I have always been afraid to go through with stuff. \n\nYes I am now sure that Al parka is a false religion and whenever I get unsure whether it's not a false religion, I just look at my nail finger.

    "selftext": "\\*Spoiler Alert\\* Hey, so I know this may be old news to some but there is a movie adapt of Ted The Caver. It being one of my favorite creepypastas I had to watch it. For those who don't know already, it's called Living Dark (2013) free on Tubi, and it isn't as much of a hard watch as it is inaccurate. I like the idea of the movie and the first third of the plot, of course it doesn't mirror the pasta great but it is decently on track for that portion. Joe was portrayed as some funny Aussie which is just wildly inaccurate and he's killed off with no explanation or funeral or anything so that's.. uh, that. It's pretty much a rando walks up to Ted and says \"That guys dead, yeah he died just yesterday.\" I would've liked to see more of the psychological toll the cave takes on Joe and Ted, as it doesn't even show the city look out scene which was crucial to the lore imo. Another thing is, I was really excited when I saw casting for B and ted, just  to find out the one that looks exactly like canon B is actually playing Ted and the man who looks exactly like Ted is playing B... Like okay, fine. They added characters and their own lore which tbh was pretty interesting I didn't mind that at all but I did mind the expungement of Whip. Whip is a legend and he wasn't mentioned ONCE throughout the movie. Absolutely unacceptable for that. Also, the unknown creature became known  and was a humanoid burnt to a crisp apparition. Most innacurate part. I would've loved it they instead didn't show the creature kind of as the pasta did. Oh yeah! And the scenes between B and Ted (who are brothers for some reason) are so suggestive, just, you'd have to watch it to see what I'm saying. I seriously was prepared to turn the tv off if they kissed. It was a fun joke my sister and I had throughout the movie because, well, it happens the entire movie. Anyways I recommend watching it unless you're one who gets mad at inconsistencies, it was a pretty fun spin on the original. "

    "selftext": "There\u2019s a building in my hometown that no one talks about anymore. I think people used to, back when there were still yellowed pamphlets taped to telephone poles about \u201ccommunity restoration\u201d or whatever the hell that meant. It was quiet for a while. Then the signs stopped showing up. People forgot. Or maybe they just didn\u2019t want to remember.\n\nI only ended up back here because my aunt died. She lived alone on the outskirts of the neighborhood, the kind of house with a screened-in porch that smells like dust even when it\u2019s raining. I came to pack up her stuff, maybe flip the place or rent it out, but I didn\u2019t get that far.\n\nHer will was strange. Not dramatic, just\u2026 off. The language felt wrong. Like it had been written by someone trying to sound formal but missing the point entirely.\n\nThe last line was what stuck:\n\n*\u201cDo not go to the library.\u201d*\n\nThat\u2019s it. No explanation. Just that sentence, sitting alone on the last page, typed clean and sharp, like everything else.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. We don\u2019t have a library.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nThe building\u2019s still there, tucked behind the old city records office, across from what used to be a dentist\u2019s office with windows permanently fogged over from years of neglect. But nobody calls it the library. Nobody calls it anything.\n\nExcept I did. I called it what it was. I called it what I remembered. I should\u2019ve left it alone.\n\nBut if you grew up where I did, you probably remember the old card catalog. Not digital. Not even electric. Real wood, metal handles, rows of tiny drawers labeled in that fading plastic sticker tape. You\u2019d open one and hear the squeak of swollen wood rubbing against more swollen wood. The cards smelled like glue and mold. If you stayed still long enough, you\u2019d start to think the drawers were breathing.\n\nThat\u2019s the memory that came back when I walked past the building for the first time in years. The sidewalk was cracked. Some of the bricks from the library wall had fallen and were never picked up. The front doors were chained shut, but I noticed something weird. The chains were new.\n\nClean. Tight. Bolted into the frame like whoever put them there wasn\u2019t trying to keep people out.\n\nThey were keeping something in.\n\nI circled around the back and found the basement entrance. I used to sneak in there as a kid with a flashlight and a bottle of soda I wasn\u2019t supposed to have. The lock was gone. Not broken. Just gone. Like someone had taken it off neatly and left no trace.\n\nIt smelled the same. Old paper, wet stone, something else underneath. Something I didn\u2019t remember but recognized anyway. A kind of metallic rot. Like rust if rust had a temperature.\n\nI only took three steps in before I found it. The card catalog.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t have been there. The basement wasn\u2019t where they kept it. That thing used to sit proudly near the front, right past the information desk. But here it was, shoved into the center of the concrete floor like it had been dragged there and left in a hurry.\n\nI don\u2019t know what possessed me to open a drawer. Maybe it was the smell. Or the silence. Or the way my aunt\u2019s last words kept humming in the back of my head like static.\n\nI pulled open the second drawer from the top.\n\nThere was only one card inside.\n\nIt had my name on it.\n\nNot just my name. My address. My date of birth. The name of my ex, who moved away last spring. My blood type. I didn\u2019t even know my blood type. But it was there.\n\nTyped in red.\n\nAll of it.\n\nI flipped the card over, and there were words written in a shaky, angular hand. Not typed. Not neat. Like it had been scribbled in the dark:\n\n*\u201cyou shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d*\n\nI dropped the card and slammed the drawer shut.\n\nThat should\u2019ve been it. That should\u2019ve been enough. I should\u2019ve turned around and left that place behind me, gone home, booked a flight, burned the house down if I had to.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t.\n\nBecause right as I turned to leave, I heard it.\n\nA drawer opening.\n\nNot behind me. Not in front of me.\n\nAll around me.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to explain it. The catalog drawers, they weren\u2019t just drawers anymore. They were mouths. Hollow little mouths yawning open one by one in slow succession, metal clacking, wood creaking. It was like a song played in a language I wasn\u2019t supposed to understand.\n\nAnd they weren\u2019t empty.\n\nEvery drawer had a card.\n\nEvery card had a name.\n\nAnd I recognized every single one of them.\n\nPeople I knew. People I\u2019d forgotten. People I hadn\u2019t met yet.\n\nAnd the worst part?\n\nSome of the cards were blank. Just waiting.\n\nThe drawer behind me slammed shut. I didn\u2019t even look. I just ran.\n\nI tripped on the stairs. Skinned my hands and knees on the way up. Didn\u2019t feel it until hours later.\n\nWhen I got outside, the air felt wrong. Heavier somehow. Like the pressure had changed while I was in there. Like something else had come out with me.\n\nI haven\u2019t been back since. Not inside.\n\nBut sometimes at night, when I\u2019m trying to sleep, I hear drawers opening.\n\nJust one at first.\n\nThen another.\n\nAnd another.\n\nUntil it\u2019s all I can hear.\n\nThat soft sliding wood. That cold click of metal.\n\nThat breathing.\n\nI think it\u2019s reading me.\n\nI didn't sleep that night. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the drawers opening, heard the soft sliding of wood, the click of metal handles. The image of my name, typed in red, burned into my mind.\u200b\n\nThe next morning, I tried to convince myself it was a dream. A hallucination brought on by stress and grief. But the scrape on my knee, the splinters in my palm, told a different story.\u200b\n\nI needed answers.\n\nI returned to the library, this time in daylight. The building looked even more decrepit under the sun. The chains on the front doors still gleamed, too new for a place forgotten.\u200b\n\nI circled to the back, found the basement door ajar. The air inside was stale, thick with the scent of mildew and something else\u2014something metallic.\u200b\n\nThe card catalog stood where I'd left it, drawers closed. I approached cautiously, half-expecting them to spring open. They didn't.\u200b\n\nI opened the drawer with my name. The card was gone.\u200b\n\nIn its place was a new card, blank except for a single line:\u200b\n\n*\"Reading Room.\"\u200b*\n\nI remembered the Reading Room from my childhood\u2014a spacious area on the main floor, filled with long tables and tall windows. But the main floor had been inaccessible, the front doors chained.\u200b\n\nI searched the basement, found a narrow staircase leading up. The door at the top was unlocked.\u200b\n\nThe Reading Room was bathed in a sickly yellow light filtering through grime-covered windows. Dust motes danced in the air. The tables were gone, replaced by rows of chairs facing a blank wall.\u200b\n\nOn each chair sat a person. Motionless. Eyes closed. Breathing shallow.\u200b\n\nI recognized some of them\u2014neighbors, teachers, people I'd known. All seated, as if waiting for something.\u200b\n\nA low hum filled the room, growing louder. The wall flickered, revealing a projection\u2014a grainy video of the card catalog, drawers opening and closing.\u200b\n\nThe people in the chairs began to speak in unison, reciting names, dates, events. Their voices overlapped, creating a cacophony of memories not their own.\u200b\n\nI backed away, heart pounding, and fled down the stairs, out of the library, into the daylight.\u200b\n\nThe whispers followed me home.\u200b\n\nThe house felt wrong when I got back. I kept the lights off, like maybe it would make me less noticeable. Like if I didn\u2019t move too much, whatever followed me wouldn\u2019t see me.\n\nBut the whispers didn\u2019t care about the dark. They moved through the walls, the floor, the vents. They filled the cracks in the wood and the gaps around the windows.\n\nAt first, it was little things. I\u2019d hear my name in the background of songs on the radio. See flickers of myself standing in reflections that didn\u2019t match my movements.\n\nThen the television turned itself on. Static.\n\nThick, heavy static that crackled and buzzed, louder than it should have been. The screen showed nothing but white noise, but if I stared long enough, I could almost make out shapes moving behind it.\n\nIt got worse after midnight.\n\nThe static started to bleed out of the TV, dripping into the air, weighing down the room like fog. I couldn\u2019t breathe right. I couldn\u2019t think straight.\n\nI smashed the TV with a hammer from the garage. The glass shattered in a spray of dust and black. For a second, the room was quiet.\n\nThen the phone rang.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to answer it. I let it ring until the machine picked up, but when the message played, it wasn\u2019t my voice.\n\nIt was me, but not.\n\nThe recording said, *\"You have been selected for documentation. Your story is incomplete.\"*\n\nClick.\n\nThe dial tone screamed in the empty house.\n\nI tried to leave. Keys, wallet, shoes\u2014out the door. I didn\u2019t even grab a jacket.\n\nThe world outside wasn\u2019t right either.\n\nThe sky was that same static gray as the broken TV. The streets were empty, but I could see figures standing in the distance, motionless, facing my house.\n\nRows of them. Hundreds. Maybe more.\n\nAll standing like the people in the Reading Room.\n\nBreathing shallow. Eyes closed. Waiting.\n\nI backed into the house and locked the door. Like it would help.\n\nThe only thing I could think to do was go back.\n\nBack to the library.\n\nMaybe if I gave them what they wanted, they'd stop.\n\nOr maybe it was already too late.\n\nI grabbed a flashlight and went back into the basement. The door closed behind me without anyone touching it.\n\nThe drive back to the library barely felt real. I don\u2019t even remember the stoplights or the turns. It was like I blinked and I was there.\n\nThe building looked worse than before.\n\nThe front windows were dark, smeared over with something like ash or dirt. Half the sign had fallen down. The front door hung open a few inches, just enough to feel like it was waiting for me.\n\nI parked on the curb and left the car running.\n\nI don\u2019t know why.\n\nMaybe some part of me thought I could outrun whatever this was.\n\nThe second I stepped inside, the air changed. It was thick and heavy, like stepping underwater. The smell was worse now too, sharp and sour, like paper left to rot.\n\nThe lights buzzed overhead, flickering.\n\nRows and rows of books stretched into the dark. Way more than I remembered. Way more than should have fit inside the building.\n\nAnd the shelves.\n\nThey moved.\n\nThey didn\u2019t walk or shake or sway. They breathed.\n\nSlow, rising and falling motions, like lungs struggling to pull in air.\n\nI kept moving, flashlight sweeping side to side. Every time the light landed on a shelf, it stilled. But out of the corner of my eye, I saw them moving. Contracting. Expanding.\n\nThe Reading Room was up ahead, down a long aisle that hadn't been there before.\n\nIt was darker there, darker than it should have been.\n\nAnd I could hear something.\n\nPages turning.\n\nDozens of them.\n\nHundreds.\n\nThe sound layered over itself, louder and louder, until it was deafening.\n\nI covered my ears and stumbled forward.\n\nWhen I finally broke through the last aisle, the Reading Room opened up around me like a throat swallowing me whole.\n\nThe chairs were still there. The tables too.\n\nBut now every seat was filled.\n\nPeople hunched over books, flipping pages faster than should have been possible. Their hands a blur. Their faces blank.\n\nThe librarian was there too. Or what was left of her.\n\nHer figure was half melted into the desk, like wax held too close to a flame. Her mouth stretched open in a scream that never ended.\n\nBut the worst part was the books.\n\nEach one had a name stamped on the cover in heavy black ink.\n\nNames I recognized.\n\nMy parents. My sister. My old classmates.\n\nAnd there.\n\nAt the very front.\n\nA book with my name on it.\n\nStill blank.\n\nStill waiting.\n\nI didn't want to touch it. Every part of me screamed to run.\n\nBut my hand moved on its own.\n\nI reached out and opened it.\n\nAnd the world broke apart."

    "selftext": "\"I am The Witness, the one who speaks when the world looks away. I have watched shadows twist into faces, and men of honour chase things that shouldn't exist. This is the story of Simon Cole, a cop who followed whispers of deaths too brutal to be random, and found a laughter that eats the soul.\"\n\nSimon\u2019s first clue came in the precinct\u2019s morning briefing\u2014two bodies found in a rowhouse off Maple Street. Both victims bore slit throats, their blood painted into arcane symbols on the walls. No fingerprints. No witnesses. Only a single scrap of paper taped to each door\u2014a crude yellow smiley face, grinning wider than nature intended.\n\nOver the next week, more disappearances, a college student never made it home, a delivery driver vanished between stops, an elderly man, last seen stumbling into the churchyard. At each scene Simon found that same smile.\n\nHis first real lead came from Teresa Reed, the local librarian. She found that face taped inside half a dozen returned books\u2014glued to the title page. One morning she even heard it whispering from the stacks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s recruiting,\u201d she told him, voice shaking. \u201cIt\u2019s inviting people to join it's inside joke, and they laugh.\u201d She was found dead the next morning.\n\nNext was Steven Davidson, a high school history teacher. He\u2019d caught his students passing around the image on their phones\u2014watching clips of some unknown hacker hijacking local newsfeeds, overlaying that smile, then vanishing. After that the kids started turning up missing.\n\nAnd then there was Susanna Hartley, the silver haired church speaker who led sermons on mercy and forgiveness. Simon met her at a community meeting about the string of ritualistic killings. She\u2019d noticed masked figures drifting through the pews\u2014worshippers wearing those same yellow faces as masks.\n\n\u201cFollow them,\u201d Susanna urged gently, \u201cbut be careful. They whisper blessings in your ear, then slit your throat when you kneel.\u201d\n\nSimon staked out abandoned storefronts and derelict warehouses. He trailed suspects who sprinted under flickering streetlights, their masks painting them as children\u2019s toys gone wrong. He collected scraps of black robes, lengths of butcher-knife blade, scraps of blood-soaked cloth. And always, the yellow face.\n\nThree nights ago, Susanna called him, she\u2019d seen masked worshippers slipping into a boarded up bell tower behind her church. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you there,\u201d she said.\n\nSimon arrived to find the heavy boards pried open. He slipped inside, pistol drawn, every sense screaming. Down a spiraling stair he crept, following a low chant. At the top, beyond cracked masonry, he found a trapdoor. He pried it open, surveyed the narrow ladder. It led deeper than he\u2019d ever expected, into the earth.\n\nAlone, Simon descended into the cult\u2019s hidden sanctum. He passed torch lit murals of that smile. He heard distant laughter, like children singing, and the echo of a woman\u2019s voice,\u201cYou belong once you taste the blood.\u201d\n\nHe dropped silently into a vast chamber. Dozens knelt in a circle around a figure. Their masks glimmered yellow in the torchlight. At the center knelt a hooded figure. A shape stirred before her\u2014a trembling initiate, eyes wide. The figure slowly stood and dropped it's hood, a otherworldly face revealed. A sideways mouth where a face should be, gums replacing head, teeth where facial features should be. The creature laughed and used a sharpened bone to cut her wrist, feeding the blood to the initiate.\n\nSimon gasped. He raised his gun, finger on the trigger\u2014then realized the room has gone silent. Everyone in the room looked in his direction at once. Simon managed to shoot the thing's right hand\u2014a hole straight through palm\u2014before the cultists ran at him.\n\nSimon dove for cover, firing at the nearest two. One fell with a shriek and the other\u2019s mask rolled across the stone. He bolted down a side passage, picking off members as he ran, each shot echoing like a funeral bell.\n\nHis phone buzzed, \u201cBackup en route. ETA five.\u201d He cursed under his breath and pressed on, adrenaline burning through his veins.\n\nUp a narrow stair, into a dark chamber, then out through a trapdoor onto fresh night air. He radioed his location. \u201cNorth face of the bell tower,\u201d he panted. \u201cSend everyone.\u201d\n\nWithin minutes, floodlights snapped on. SWAT officers fanned out, weapons trained on the shattered boards. Simon led the way back down, heart pounding with triumph.\n\nSusanna Hartley stood at the base of the stairs, bathed in light, smiling. Her silver hair like a halo. Relief flooded Simon\u2019s chest.\n\n\u201cSimon, you did it,\u201d she said softly. \u201cYou saved them.\u201d\n\nBehind him, his team cuffed two cultists whose masks lay cracked on the stone. Simon reached for Susanna\u2019s right hand\u2014then saw the bullet wound.\n\n\u201cSusanna\u2014what did you\u2014\u201d he began.\n\n\u201cI told you to be careful,\u201d she whispered.\n\nSimon\u2019s heart froze. He took a step back. Before he could react, every officer swivelled, guns pointed\u2014not at the cultists, but at him.\n\n\u201cDrop your weapon,\u201d their captain snarled.\n\n\u201cWhy\u2014\u201d Simon choked.\n\nSusanna laughed, she digged at the skin on the back of her head, teeth jutted out from under skin, her face devoured by the sideways mouth, the unnatural true face revealed.\n\nThe officers\u2014the ones he trusted\u2014pushed Simon to his knees, waiting for her.\n\nSusanna walked close, putting her hand on his shoulder.\n\n\"You were a good soldier, but you were on the wrong side.\" Susanna whispered.\n\nShe devoured his face with the unnatural maw. And when the maw receded into the back of it's head, the only face seen on it's body was Simon's, it's form changing from female to male.\n\n\"Beware the hijacked screens that flash that yellow face. And never trust the friends who guide you into the dark\u2014because one day, you may answer their call and awaken wearing someone else\u2019s smile.\""

    "selftext": "I wanted to create a creepypasta for fun, but am now wondering if it even classifies as one and if it is good in the eyes of others. This is my first time making one, and I would be happy to get some advice please.\n\nMy Idea: \n\nI was thinking of a shapeshifting entity that would shapeshift into an anthropomorphic animal of the person's liking and appear in your room after waking up and be like: hello. I'm your new imaginary friend. He is only seen by the victim. The entity would ease the victim like a real friend, jet-neutral and distant but somewhat warm. This is a trap that makes the victim want to come closer. The closer something is to the entity, the faster it can absorb your vitality. Each day you would feel weaker and weaker, until your last night. That night the entity will expose his intentions before you die of unknown causes, making you wonder if he really was all that bad since he was a TRUE friend, but one that killed you slowly. The next day the entity would eat your body, leaving no evidence, and disappear until hungering again.\n\nShort story example:\n\n**Title:** *The Friend in the Fur*\n\nIt starts the night after a dream. You don\u2019t remember the dream, just the soft click of your bedroom door opening \u2014 and there he is. Standing in the half-dark, a figure shaped like the animal you always wanted for a friend when you were little. Soft fur, kind eyes, the perfect voice: *\"Hello. I'm your new imaginary friend.\"*\n\nYou laugh. You think you're dreaming. You're not.\n\nNo one else sees him. No one else *can*.\n\nAt first, he's harmless \u2014 distant, even polite. He sits quietly at the edge of your room, smiling faintly, always at a respectful distance. He asks nothing from you. He listens better than any human friend ever could. Warm but...hollow, somehow.\n\nAnd every day after, you wake up a little weaker. A little slower. Your body aching in ways it never has before. Doctors shrug. Blood tests are fine. Maybe you're just tired, they say. Maybe it's all in your head.\n\nYou feel yourself slipping away.\n\nYou start *needing* the Friend more. His presence is comforting even as it drains you. He never pushes, but he\u2019s *always closer* than before \u2014 at your bedside, within arm\u2019s reach.\n\nYou don't fight it.\n\nYou can\u2019t.\n\nOn the last night, when you can barely lift your head from the pillow, he sits next to you and leans in, almost tenderly. *\"I'm so glad we got to know each other,\"* he whispers. *\"You were never really alone. Not until now.\"*\n\nAnd as your heart stutters its last, you wonder \u2014 was he really so bad? A true friend, until the end.\n\nThe next morning, your bed is empty. The room is clean. You're gone. And somewhere, not far away, the Friend licks clean claws and waits for the next lonely soul to dream.\n\nMy opinion: \n\nIt taps in to the feeling of lonelyness and explores the idea of fals safty. Unlike most creepypastas (I think) it is less horrific and violent. If you *were* the victim, you'd feel safe. You'd trust \"the\" Friend. You might even be *grateful* for him. And then, in the end, you die *still wondering* if it was a betrayal... or just somthing you should be happy about, since it listened like no other friend could.\n\n"

    "selftext": "It was late April in Mexico.\nThe heat clung to everything \u2014 thick, heavy, and inescapable. Locals in the smaller villages spoke in hushed tones about a creature they called El Chupacabra \u2014 \"goat sucker\" in Spanish. Rumors spread faster than wildfire. Livestock were found drained of blood, their bodies left stiff and cold under the scorching sun. Strange footprints littered the dusty earth. No government official wanted to touch it. Too messy. Too dangerous. So they called us: the M.C.U. \u2014 Mobile Cryptid Unit.\n\nWe specialize in hunting what most people think are just myths.\nOur job isn\u2019t glamorous. It\u2019s grueling, thankless, and usually ends in bruises \u2014 if we\u2019re lucky. We've seen things no one would believe. Things no one should believe. And yet, here we were again.\n\nWe tracked the creature for two nights straight, barely sleeping, always moving.\nIt was fast \u2014 faster than anything that size should be. Small, hairless, and hunched, it resembled a coyote at first glance... but wrong. Wrong in ways you couldn\u2019t explain without sounding insane. Its eyes caught our flashlight beams and reflected them back like twin silver mirrors. It didn\u2019t growl like a dog or a cat. Its low rumble vibrated in your chest like the hum of broken machinery.\n\nOn the third night, we set the trap. Three tranquilizer darts punched into its flank before it finally dropped. Even sedated, it writhed and snapped with feral rage. It took six of us \u2014 strong, trained field agents \u2014 just to hoist it into the reinforced transport cage. The stench it gave off was indescribable, a mix of wet rust, sour earth, and rotting meat. You don't forget a smell like that.\n\nWe transported it to containment at HQ.\nThere, deep underground, we maintain dozens of artificial ecosystems \u2014 thick jungles, barren deserts, icy tundras \u2014 all hidden from the world above. Each environment is tailored to its inhabitant, custom-built to keep cryptids alive but isolated. Alive... and secret.\n\nI can\u2019t tell you my name.\nClearance levels, you understand. But you need to know: monsters are real. Always have been.\nBigfoot lurking in misty forests. Unicorns \u2014 not the shimmering beauties you imagine, but violent, territorial beasts. Lizard men slipping through sewers beneath your cities. Arby's \u2014 well, that's a different kind of monster. The Loch Ness Monster, sliding silently through black waters. Shadow people, whispering from the corners of your room. Mothman, Skinwalkers, and others whose names haven't even made it into your nightmares yet.\n\nIf you ever feel like you\u2019re being watched... you are.\n\nAnd if you comfort yourself with the thought that disbelief protects you \u2014 that skepticism keeps you safe \u2014 let me tell you:\nIt doesn\u2019t.\nReality doesn't need your belief to exist. The dark corners of the world don't care whether or not you think they're real they are they kill and it's my job to stop them\n\nThis?\nThis is only the beginning.\n\n\u014a\u0259v\u0119\u0159 \u0142\u0115\u00fe \u0177\u0153\u0171\u0159 \u0123\u00e6\u016f\u0159\u00f0 \u0257\u0151\u1e85\u014b.\u00fe\u0125\u0259\u0177 \u1e85\u00e6\u1e6d\u00e7\u0125 \u0115v\u00ea\u0159\u1ef3 \u0163\u012fm\u0115 \u014a\u0259v\u0119\u0159 \u0165\u0159\u1ef3 \u00fe\u0153 \u0125\u012f\u0111\u0259 \u00de\u0124\u00c6\u0176 \u015e\u0114\u018f \u0176\u0152\u016e"

No escape.\n\nThe house grows hot and small.\nThe floors buckle. The walls bleed salt water.\nThe clocks melt into formless gobs on the walls.\n\nAnd then he realizes there is a fourteenth fish.\n\nIt is not delivered.\n\nIt is inside him.\n\nSomething has been building all along, quiet and patient and swelling. A wrongness seeded inside his body, threading into his veins.\n\nHe feels it when he closes his eyes. A twitch beneath his ribs. A cold slithering up his spine.\n\nThe thirteenth herrings were never the curse.\nThey were the warnings.\n\nThe fourteenth is transformation."

    "selftext": "A while ago, I found this obscure website called dalediddles.com. It was a weird, yet funny website, made by some guy named Dale, and all you could do was wait for Dale to come online. Several people would wait in the \"Dale Que,\" and eventually, when Dale would come online, he would talk to everyone, kinda like omegle as they all got excited to be in his presence. And if you were lucky, Dale would choose you to talk to him.\n\nSince I discovered dalediddles.com, I have occasionally gotten on, sometimes chatted with people in the Dale Que, and seen Dale a couple times, but one day, it was different. I got home from school that day, about to hop on dalediddles.com, when something was different. I clicked on the website, but instead of seeing the 8-bit image of Dale saying \"Dale diddles... Dot com!\" It was replaced with a scarier Dale saying in a demonic voice \"Dale DIES dot com!\"\n\nOnce the website loaded, everything had the same format, but it was all red and black. There was nobody in the \"Evil Dale Que,\" and instead of the Dale Cam saying \"Waiting for Dale to come online,\" it read, \"Waiting for Demon Dale to come online.\"\n\nIt didn't take long for it to happen. Demon Dale finally showed up, and he was terrifying. He looked just like Dale (skinny guy, man bun, chinstrap beard), but he looked more like a demon! Demon Dale had red skin, 2 large black horns and glowing red eyes! As I was screaming, Demons Dale said \"Hi, I'm DEMON DALE!\" And then he killed me."

Everyone looks down at me and it's good, it's all good. Not being important has it's own advantages you know, you are literally invisible and no one would really care. Only the important people matter in this world, and only they are watched and observed. I need more ghosts to breath and I can only breath in ghosts, and I am running out. \n\nSo I go find someone and I find someone important, the important person doesn't want me near him. Then as I stab him, this important person knows that I am unimportant. Being unimportant means that my actions are of no importance. So this important guy was depressed that I made him unimportant and his death will now go unnoticed. His spirit will be my oxygen for a month. My lungs can only take in ghosts and when I breath out, I breath out there sins and bad actions. So there is some benefits to Mr breathing in ghosts. Then when the month ends I need to find another person.\n\nThen I find an important woman and she sees me walking towards her. She shouts at me to stay clear from her. I stab her and she is only sad because she know my actions will not take notice from anyone. When an unimportant person does something, no one cares about it. I have got her spirit to breath for a month and I breath out her sins and bad actions. I have always been unimportant and it can be very lonely but you get use to it. Everyone wants to be important. Everyone wants their actions to be noticed. \n\nThen when I found another important individual, I killed him. As usual no one cared because I am unimportant. When I started to breath in his ghostly spirit, I refused to breath out his sins. His sins were atrocious and they needed to stay with him. So i killed another important person and I started to breath in his spirit instead. Some sins don't deserve to breathed out, and there are times where I want to know what it's like to be important. Then again I will miss the freedom of being unimportant as nobody cares about what I do or where I go. "

    "selftext": "Everything I\u2019m about to say might sound made up, though there\u2019s nothing supernatural here. Whether to believe me or not is entirely up to you. Let me begin my story.**  \n\nIt was evening, around 7 PM. I was swinging on the playground as usual while my brother hung out with his friends. We were in our neighborhood courtyard, the one everyone calls *\"Green Zone\"* because of its old, broken, but still green swings and slides. I was listening to music, and my friend was on the swing next to me. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary\u2014there were about ten of us there. At one point, I heard swearing from a window but didn\u2019t pay much attention. I figured someone was just arguing\u2014it never crossed my mind they were targeting *us*.  \n\nThen, suddenly, I noticed everyone was running. My brother and I had a rule\u2014he wouldn\u2019t ditch me without warning. A few seconds later, I heard shouts: *\"Nika, run!\"*  \nI jumped off the swing and took off sprinting\u2014like I was in a P.E. race, not a casual evening.  \n\nWe turned the corner toward the dormitory where some of our friends lived, including my brother and me. Everyone was screaming, *\"He\u2019s got a knife!\"* and our friend Artyom ran into the kitchen, looking for *\"a knife sharper than his\"*\u2014his exact words.  \n\nWhen I asked what happened, they told me: from **Window #3 on the first floor**, a stranger in a **Billy the Puppet mask** (from *Saw*) had been staring at us. He wasn\u2019t just watching\u2014he was screaming obscenities, making crude gestures, and **filming us on his phone**. When the guys noticed him, Artyom walked right up and yelled, *\"Dude, this isn\u2019t funny!\"*\u2014bold but reckless. The second he did, the stranger slid a **real kitchen knife** through the window. At first, we thought it was fake\u2026 until the blade **glinted under the streetlight**. It moved unnaturally, like he was **tracing patterns on the glass**, making that awful, grating sound\u2014then suddenly, it was **pointed straight at us**.  \n\nBy the time Artyom came back with a knife from the kitchen, the window was empty. Just a **thick red curtain**, blocking any view inside. The man had **vanished**\u2014no trace, no recordings, no witnesses. Just us.  \n\nWe asked a woman passing by if anyone lived there. Her answer chilled us: *\"That apartment\u2019s been empty for years.\"*  \nNow it felt like a **horror movie clich\u00e9**\u2014was this a psycho, a ghost, or some collective hallucination?  \n\nDays later, we still don\u2019t know. We avoid that window. Sometimes, the curtain **moves on its own**, and I swear I see the mask\u2019s silhouette\u2014but when others look, there\u2019s nothing.  \n\nThen, yesterday, we found **the mask** under that window. A note was glued to it:  \n***\"The game isn\u2019t over.\"***  \n\nWe burned it.  \n**The next morning**, a **clown mask** appeared on our dorm windowsill.  \nAnother note: ***\"You broke the rules.\"***  \n\nIt\u2019s still hanging in our hallway.  \nSometimes, I feel it turning to watch us.  \nBut that\u2019s impossible\u2026 right?..

    "selftext": "Elias\u2019s backyard had this crabapple tree that was basically useless. It flowered like mad every spring, bright pink, but never actually produced any decent apples. By late summer, its leaves were already dying off, making a mess on the lawn he rarely bothered with. It was back there, near the dodgy brick wall that shed mortar like dandruff, by the alley, that he found the weird spot.\n\nIt wasn't like in the movies, no swirling colours or anything. It was just\u2026 still. A patch of air, about the size of a small suitcase standing on its end, where nothing moved. You could see dust floating around everywhere else, but it just stopped dead when it reached the edge of this spot. He saw a fly buzz right up to it and then just veer off like it hit a window, but there was nothing there. Sounds seemed quieter if you were listening\u00a0*through*\u00a0it, too \u2013 the traffic noise, birds, everything got muffled.\n\nHe found it when he dropped a screw trying to fix a fence panel. He crouched down and looked right at it. It didn't hum or glow or feel hot or cold. It was just\u2026 missing. Like someone had cut a chunk right out of the air. He poked at it. His finger met something weird \u2013 not solid, but like pushing into really thick jelly, only dry. He pulled his hand back fast.\n\n\u2018\u2018What the hell?\u2019\u2019\n\nHe watched it for a few days. He threw little stones at it; they'd hit the edge and just drop. He tried shining a torch into it, but the light just stopped, didn't bounce off or go through. It just soaked everything up: light, sound, movement. A completely dead zone in the middle of everything else.\n\nOne evening, the sun was going down, making everything look orange, and he thought he saw something\u00a0*in*\u00a0the patch. Not creatures or another place. It looked more like when you stir up mud in water, that sort of cloudy swirl. Shapes, pale like dust, moved really slowly inside. Sometimes they'd almost look like things he vaguely remembered \u2013 the shape of a handle from an old mug, the outline of a bird, a flash of light like off his grandad's glasses. Just faint hints. Leftover images.\n\nIt didn't feel dangerous at first, just really strange. He got the feeling whatever was in there belonged there, like the noise the fridge makes or the house creaking. Normal background stuff you don't notice.\n\nHe reached out again, pushing his fingers against that weird edge. He kept them there this time, trying to just feel it. That\u2019s when the weirdest thing happened, and it wasn\u2019t about the patch, it was about him.\n\nHe suddenly remembered being a little kid, hiding behind this same tree, upset because he\u2019d lost a toy car. He could almost feel the rough bark \u2013 like old, dry leather \u2013 against his cheek and see the exact green colour of the car. As soon as the memory hit him, a little flicker of that same green colour swirled in the dusty stuff in the patch, then vanished.\n\nHe tried again. A tight feeling, like he\u2019d swallowed ice, started low in his gut. He thought about a row he\u2019d had with his sister, the nasty things they\u2019d said. A sharp, broken-looking shape flashed inside the patch, lingering a bit longer this time. He thought about this tune he kept trying to remember but couldn't quite get. A sort of wavy, silvery pattern appeared, and it seemed to pulse faintly, drawing his eye.\n\nHe realised it wasn't just a window. It was feeding.\n\n\u2018\u2018Feeding\u2019\u2019.\n\nThe shapes weren't just echoes; they were the\u00a0*remains*\u00a0of thoughts, feelings, moments that had happened there, being slowly broken down, digested by the stillness. And now, it had noticed him.\n\nHe pulled his hand back, but the feeling didn't stop. It was like a faint static cling, not on his skin, but\u00a0*on his thoughts*. He tried thinking about what he'd have for dinner, but the image flickered, replaced for a second by the dusty swirl inside the patch. He tried remembering his mum's face, and for a terrifying moment, the memory felt thin, distant, like it was being pulled away from him towards the stillness behind the crabapple tree.\n\nThe patch wasn't just a thin spot where you could see the past getting processed. It was the processor itself. And it was hungry. It had tasted his memories, his emotions. He looked at it again, and the dusty shapes inside seemed clearer now, sharper. He could almost make out the green toy car, the jagged edges of the argument, the silver curve of the melody. They weren't just echoes anymore. They were\u00a0*his*\u00a0echoes, added to the collection.\n\nHe backed away slowly, his breath catching in his throat. It wasn't a portal\u00a0*to*\u00a0somewhere else. It was an endpoint. A place where things ended up, stripped down to faint whispers and then\u2026 nothing. And it knew him now. He could feel it, a persistent tugging at the edges of his mind, like trying to remember something you know you've forgotten. He had a horrible feeling that sooner or later, it wouldn't just be his memories it was pulling on. The stillness wasn't empty.\n\nIt was waiting\u2026"

Apparently, the same author wrote a sequel, with sixteen new photographs.\n\nThe only version of it I can find, however, is [a narration on YouTube done by a computer-generated robotic voice](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=F2pEDPuJiM8). It's fine for getting the gist of the story, but it's not the clearest. There are references to it in the comments on the Creepypasta Wiki page for Anomaly, but the link provided is dead. Searching for it on the wiki and Google returns nothing, though the beginning of the original text still shows up in a Google search.\n\nDoes anyone have a link, or any ideas for how to find this story?"

At first, they assumed I was part of a set of twins. But now that the body count has reached 72, that theory is obviously absurd. Both of my parents have passed away, and I\u2019m an only child.*\n\n*In the beginning, the remains were barely recognizable\u2014just garbage bags filled with what looked like meat, hidden deep in the woods. But over time, whatever is doing this has grown bolder, dumping the bodies in public places I frequent.*\n\n*Authorities have confirmed the bodies are human, but many are missing vital organs\u2014usually the brain, lungs, but sometimes limbs are absent as well. It\u2019s also believed that not all of them were killed\u2026 assuming they were ever truly alive to begin with.*\n\n*The police are investigating but progress in the case has stagnated. Besides the fact that bodies keep popping up. We do fear that eventually one of the bodies will actually be me so I have been forced to undergo daily surveillance and wellness checks. Along with constant harassment from news outlets trying to get a fresh scoop but instead of letting a bunch of shameless ghouls profit off of me I'm just going to inform the people directly.

I remember checking my phone \u2014 12:47 AM. I was in the last car, slumped near the window, headphones in, watching the lights blur past outside. But then the announcements stopped making sense.\n\n\u201cNext stop\u2026 Reverie Junction.\u201d\n\nAin\u2019t never heard of that place before, and I\u2019ve lived in this city my whole life. I figured I was half-asleep or maybe hopped on the wrong line, but nah. I checked the map above the doors. Same route. Same stops. Only\u2026 Reverie Junction wasn\u2019t there.\n\nI shrugged it off at first. Figured I missed my stop, I\u2019d just hop off and grab a ride back.\n\nBut I never got the chance.\n\nEvery time we slowed down, I thought, this is it. But the doors never opened. Sometimes I\u2019d see the same stations blur by again \u2014 Eastwood, Brighton, and Harborview. Over and over. At least five times I seen that same graffiti on the Harborview bench: a smiley face with no eyes. I started counting. Harborview hit number nine before I stopped counting.\n\nThere were other people on the train at first. A few, anyway. Old guy in a suit, girl with pink hair, a mother with her sleeping kid. I even asked the old guy what stop he was getting off at. He looked at me confused and said, \u201cDidn\u2019t we already pass that?\u201d\n\nThen he was gone.\n\nLike, not \u201cgot off the train\u201d gone. I mean, I blinked \u2014 and poof. Empty seat. No footsteps. Nothing. The girl with the pink hair? She was just standing near the door one minute, head against the glass\u2026 next time I looked, her reflection was still there \u2014 but she wasn\u2019t.\n\nNow it\u2019s just me.\n\nSometimes the intercom crackles, and I swear I hear someone breathing. Not talking. Just slow, steady breathing, like they\u2019re trying not ta be heard. The lights flicker a lot now. And outside the windows, the world looks\u2026 wrong.\n\nThe tracks are lined with trees, but the trees are moving. Not passing by \u2014 like, they sway toward the train. Like they\u2019re reaching.\n\nI tried pulling the emergency brake. Nothing happened. I kicked at the doors, tried prying them open. All I got was this weird static ringing in my ears.\n\nFood\u2019s gone. My phone\u2019s dead. I tried writing the date on the back of a receipt just to keep track, but the ink fades by morning. Every time.\n\nI don\u2019t even sleep anymore. Every time I close my eyes, I dream of tracks twisting into a spiral, and the train just diving into it, deeper and deeper.\n\nIf you ever hear of Reverie Junction, don\u2019t get on that train.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re already on it\u2026\n\nYou might be the next one to disappear.\n\nBecause the last stop?\nIt never comes."

That Night I couldn't get sleep, I kept on thinking of the audio, and I had to turn on a light eventually because I would start seeing things in the dark. Whatever that episode was, it just left me with a feeling I was being watched."

    "selftext": "Marc Russo was a good kid when I met him. We go way back. Orphanage days back. We\u2019d been through it all together. Two godforsaken kids with a couple of loose screws abandoned dropped off into hell in the middle fuck-all-country. Neither of us was particularly bright, so when adulthood came, we were sold on promoting freedom to faraway places where oppression was the local currency. Two stupid teenagers were given rifles and told to shoot.\n\nWe did, and for the longest time; loved every second of it. Or so I thought, looking back, I don\u2019t think he had as much of a good time as I did. He always seemed a little too on edge, even in Afghan, where you had to be on edge \u2013 he was about to snap at every turn. I wasn\u2019t like that; I was a soldier, I felt at home there not because I enjoyed the constant sense of danger or because I liked killing people or because I felt particularly patriotic, nah. That wore off quickly\u2026 I felt at home on the front because I had a family there. It wasn\u2019t just me and Marc anymore, and I thought he felt the same.\n\nFuck knows what he felt, really. Something wasn\u2019t right with him from the start, me neither if I\u2019m being honest. I was never a people person, that\u2019s why I train dogs. Dogs won\u2019t fuck you over, but I digress.\n\nEventually, Marc did snap, we stormed a spook lair. One of the spooks was a shiekh with one of the dancing boys still on his lap. Russo lost it \u2013 blasted half a mag into that old pederast. And while I get it, these are subhumans who don\u2019t deserve to live, he also blasted through the kid. Never seen him express remorse for that. His losing his cool nearly fucked up the entire operation, but we pulled through.\n\nEventually, the war ended for us and we came back home. Well, I did, Marc died there. Probably in that same moment, maybe at some other point. We\u2019ve done some atrocious things there in the name of survival, but we had to.\n\nI came back home, with many of the boys and with us came back Boogeyman Russo. He was a mess before, but now he was completely fucked in the head. Obsessed, withdrawn, bitter and angry. Some folks sought treatment; therapy is a wonderful thing if you need it. Russo never got the help he needed. Too stubborn, too stupid.\n\nThat fucking idiot\u2026\n\nI can shit on him all day long, but to his credit; he found out, somehow, that there\u2019s a local kiddy diddling ring. Smoked these snakes one by one. Lured them out into the light and got them all in trouble with the law. Tactical genius on his part. He\u2019d instigate fights and beat up those fuckers, then get them to court and there the rot would float.\n\nBut he wasn\u2019t just dishing out beatings to scum who deserved them; he was maiming them. He wanted me to join in and asked me a couple of times, I shot him down. I was building up a nice life for myself and being a vigilante didn\u2019t sound too appealing at the time.\n\nWe drifted apart over time, people change, and priorities shift. I was in a good place, and Russo, he wasn\u2019t fucking losing it. Burning every bridge to fuel his obsessive crusade. Being the Boogeyman didn\u2019t lead to any happy endings, though. He ended up crossing every imaginable line.\n\nRusso ended up putting a nineteen-year-old kid in a coma and accidentally killed his equally legal girlfriend. He begged me to help him get rid of the evidence upon finding out what he had done, but I had none of it. Nearly fucking killed him myself when he put his hands on me for refusing to help.\n\nFunny how that turns out, isn\u2019t it?\n\nHe thought the guy looked a little too old and the girl a little too young. Thought it was another one of those dirty cretins.\n\nRusso ended up behind bars for that little stunt. Twelve years. That\u2019s all he got. Good standing in the community, a vet, a hero even! He cared about the children they said, I remember, what a load of shit. Well, I moved on, even if he was my brother, he fucked up his own life. I stopped visiting him after he started rumbling borderline Satanic nonsense at me.\n\nHe got out, and no one was there to meet him, not even me.\n\nThat might\u2019ve been the final straw\u2026 But who knows?\n\nIn any case, one of them rainy nights I get a text from fucking Russo. A simple text; \u201cWe gotta talk, man\u2026\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been twelve years; What the fuck? How bad could it go? I thought to myself\u2026 Well\u2026 It went fucking brilliant.\n\nCome over to his place. It looks rundown. T\u2019was expected he was a loner who hadn\u2019t been home for over a decade. Smelled like a dead horse\u2019s worm-infested ass. I knocked, it\u2019s dead silent, I knocked again \u2013 still fucking silence. Instincts took over for a hot second and I pressed the door handle; somewhat uneasily. Again, what the fuck could go wrong? It\u2019s my man, my brother, my terror twin, for fuck\u2019s sake.\n\nWell, yeah, terror is apt in this case. The place was devoid of all life. A cemetery.\n\nA literal cemetery.\n\nThe first thing I see there is this naked lady on the floor.\n\nDead.\n\nFlies all around her \u2013 blood stains all over her body.\n\nIlluminated by the frosty steaming moonlight.\n\nThen I see Russo \u2013 the boogeyman himself.\n\nLooks like shit \u2013 smells like death.\n\nAnd I\u2019m back on the battlefield.\n\nChills run down my spine, muscles tense up, and I am afraid.\n\nThe whole thing is fucking wrong.\n\nIt\u2019s him, but it\u2019s hardly human now. Bandaged bloody mug, gnarly cuts all over. Hands gone \u2013 replaced with deer hooves \u2013 crudely bandaged to stumps.\n\nFuck he wrote that message to me?\n\nTime crawls to a halt and before I can even curse out the seemingly dead boogeyman, I see it, a pink school bag tossed aside. It\u2019s still got textbooks in there. My stomach knots and the room begins to spin.\n\nWhat have you done, Russo, you motherfucker?\n\nI see his hunting rifle and then he makes the fatal mistake of being alive. His pained moan killed any sensible thought I might\u2019ve had in between my ears. The fuck this thing is still breathing? How? It all happened so fucking fast. I grabbed his rifle and instead of shooting him \u2013 I swung like a mad fucking man. Cursing out this sack of shit as I batter his brains in. All the while, I am terrified of the possibility of him somehow getting up and fighting back.\n\nHe\u2019s just lying there, softly whimpering until he stops and eventually, I did too.\n\nI just spat in his bloodied face and stormed off when he stopped moving.\n\nThat fucking image of a mangled chimera stuck in my mind for a long while. I can swear I saw it lurking in the darkest corners of my house for a bit. Just standing there, staring at me. Fucking with my head.\n\nShit\u2019s been rough for a time\u2026 yeah\u2026 I guess I need therapy too\u2026\n\nRusso\u2019s dead\u2026\n\nShould be dead\u2026 I spilled his brains all over his piss-covered floor.\n\nBut I heard last night in the news about a strange faceless figure with hooves for hands chasing young couples through the woods, shrieking and howling for the last couple of weeks now. Shit.\n\nFuck, just thinking about it puts me on edge. It shouldn\u2019t be him \u2013 it can\u2019t, can it now?\n\nHe\u2019s supposed to be dead \u2013 his fucking brains were out.\n\nI saw them\u2026\n\nJust like in Afghan\u2026\n\nRusty red chunks on the floor\u2026 I know what his brain looks like\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve seen it before\u2026\n\nShould\u2019ve shot the motherfucker on sight, didn\u2019t I?"

    "selftext": "Full Audio Narration: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/39C8xAaqRUU](https:\/\/youtu.be\/39C8xAaqRUU)\n\nI stepped off the bus into Nevada heat that punched through my uniform. The driver tossed my duffel beside me and pulled away, leaving a cloud of dust that settled on my polished boots. Behind a chain-link fence topped with razor wire stood Bravo Mike\u2014seven squat buildings arranged in a horseshoe around a central courtyard. Nothing special. Nothing that screamed classified.\n\n\n\nA corporal met me at the gate. \"Wilson? Follow me.\"\n\n\n\nThe processing took less than an hour. I signed forms without reading them, got assigned quarters, and received my shift schedule. No welcome speech, no tour. Just paperwork and a set of keys. The corporal pointed me toward the barracks and walked away. So much for orientation.\n\n\n\nMy room was standard military\u2014twin bed, metal desk, small closet. The window faced west, showing nothing but desert and distant mountains. I unpacked my few personal items, made my bed to regulation corners, and sat down to write my mother. Halfway through the letter, I realized I couldn't tell her anything about where I was or what I'd be doing. I ended up with three paragraphs about the weather and a promise to call when I could.\n\n\n\nThat night, I reported for my first shift. The operations center sat in the middle of the base\u2014a windowless concrete box with a single reinforced door. Inside, screens lined the walls showing radar sweeps, atmospheric readings, and satellite imagery. Eight workstations faced the screens, each with its own computer setup and uncomfortable chair.\n\n\n\n\"Wilson,\" a voice called from behind me. \"Station four is yours.\"\n\n\n\nI turned to see a woman about my age with auburn hair pulled tight into a regulation bun. She held a clipboard and looked me over without smiling.\n\n\n\n\"Thanks. And you are?\"\n\n\n\n\"Bane. Natalie Bane. I'm on your rotation.\" She handed me a thick binder. \"Standard operating procedures. Memorize it by tomorrow.\"\n\n\n\nI took the binder. \"What exactly are we monitoring?\"\n\n\n\nHer expression didn't change. \"Atmospheric disturbances.\"\n\n\n\n\"What kind of\u2014\"\n\n\n\n\"Just read the manual, Wilson.\" She walked away, posture straight as a ruler.\n\n\n\nThe night crawled by. I watched numbers change on screens, logged readings every thirty minutes, and fought to stay awake. Nothing in my training had prepared me for the pure tedium of Bravo Mike. By morning, I'd read the entire manual and still had no clear idea what we were looking for.\n\n\n\nThree days later, I was eating alone in the mess when Bane sat across from me, dropping her tray with a clatter.\n\n\n\n\"Wilson,\" she said, fork already stabbing at something pretending to be meatloaf.\n\n\n\n\"Bane.\"\n\n\n\nWe ate in silence for a few minutes. The mess hall hummed with low conversations, metal scraping against trays, the kitchen staff yelling orders.\n\n\n\n\"Did you figure it out yet?\" she finally asked.\n\n\n\n\"Figure what out?\"\n\n\n\nShe leaned forward. \"What we're actually doing here.\"\n\n\n\nI shook my head. \"Atmospheric monitoring seems pretty straightforward.\"\n\n\n\nShe snorted. \"Right. And they need a hundred personnel and triple-layer security for that.\"\n\n\n\nI glanced around, lowering my voice. \"You think there's something else?\"\n\n\n\n\"I know there is.\" She took a bite, chewed, swallowed. \"Whatever we're watching for, it's not just weather.\"\n\n\n\nBefore I could respond, the mess hall door swung open and Sergeant Thomas Cooper walked in. The room went quiet. Cooper was tall with the kind of military bearing that made you want to stand at attention even in the shower. His eyes swept the room once, paused briefly on our table, then moved on. The conversations slowly resumed, but quieter than before.\n\n\n\n\"That's our fearless leader,\" Natalie said, not looking up from her food. \"Sergeant Cooper. Man of mystery and zero explanations.\"\n\n\n\n\"You've worked with him before?\"\n\n\n\n\"Six months. Never heard him say more than twenty words at a time.\" She pushed her tray away. \"Just follow orders, Wilson. That's all anyone does here.\"\n\n\n\nWeeks passed. The desert winter brought cold nights and clear skies. I settled into the rhythm of Bravo Mike\u2014eat, work, sleep, repeat. The tedium became comfortable. I got to know the others on my shift rotation. Martinez always brought homemade jerky. Chen could solve crosswords in ten minutes flat. Rogers kept a picture of his kids hidden under his keyboard.\n\n\n\nAnd then there was Natalie. We got paired on night shifts often, midnight to eight, when the base slept and the screens glowed in the dark. She relaxed around three a.m., when the coffee kicked in and fatigue lowered defenses. We talked about home, about training, about the food in the mess hall. Never about what we were monitoring.\n\n\n\n\"I'm from Michigan,\" she told me one night, feet propped on her desk. \"Little town on Lake Huron you never heard of.\"\n\n\n\n\"Try me.\"\n\n\n\n\"Harrisville.\"\n\n\n\nI laughed. \"My grandparents had a cabin in Greenbush. We went up every summer.\"\n\n\n\nHer eyes lit up. \"No way. Small world.\"\n\n\n\nAfter that, night shifts felt less like duty and more like time with a friend. We developed a shorthand for the boring parts of the job. She'd catch me nodding off and flick paper clips at my head. I'd bring extra coffee when she looked tired. Small things. Normal things in an abnormal place.\n\n\n\nCooper rarely visited during night shifts. When he did, it was just to check logs and leave. No small talk, no interest in his personnel beyond their function. I heard stories from others\u2014how he'd dress down anyone who asked too many questions, how he kept his own quarters separate from everyone else's, how no one had ever seen him laugh.\n\n\n\n\"Blind obedience,\" Natalie whispered one night after he left. \"That's his motto.\"\n\n\n\nI shrugged. \"He's military.\"\n\n\n\n\"There's military, and then there's whatever Cooper is.\"\n\n\n\nJanuary slipped into February. Nothing changed in the rhythm of Bravo Mike except the temperature outside. I'd been there long enough to stop counting days. Long enough that most nights I could do my job on autopilot, logging readings without really seeing them. Long enough that Natalie started bringing extra granola bars because she noticed I always got hungry around four.\n\n\n\nOn February 18th, I showed up for midnight shift as usual. Chen was finishing his rotation, eyes bloodshot from eight hours of screen time.\n\n\n\n\"All quiet,\" he said, standing up from station four. \"Enjoy the boredom.\"\n\n\n\nI settled in, logging my start time. Natalie arrived five minutes later, coffee already in hand.\n\n\n\n\"Extra shot of espresso tonight,\" she said, taking her seat at station six. \"Had a feeling we might need it.\"\n\n\n\nI didn't ask why. Some nights she just had hunches.\n\n\n\nThe first four hours passed like any other shift. We monitored, we logged, we talked about nothing important. At 4:17 a.m., the door opened. Cooper walked in, looking exactly as he always did\u2014pressed uniform, perfect posture, expression carved from stone. But something was different. It took me a second to realize he was carrying a sealed manila envelope.\n\n\n\nHe walked straight to my station. \"Wilson.\"\n\n\n\nI sat up straighter. \"Yes, Sergeant?\"\n\n\n\n\"You have new orders.\" He placed the envelope on my desk. \"Read them, memorize them, then destroy them. You have five minutes.\"\n\n\n\nHe stepped back, watching me. I felt Natalie's eyes on me too, but didn't look her way. The envelope had no markings except a red stamp reading \"CLASSIFIED\" across the seal. I broke it open and pulled out a single sheet of paper.\n\n\n\nThe orders were simple but made no sense. I was to proceed to Building C, Room 217, and wait for further instruction. I was not to discuss these orders with anyone. I was not to deviate from the prescribed route. I was to bring no electronic devices.\n\n\n\nI memorized the instructions, then handed the paper back to Cooper. He took a lighter from his pocket and burned it, letting the ashes fall into a trash can.\n\n\n\n\"Report to Building C now,\" he said. \"Bane, you're coming too.\"\n\n\n\nNatalie looked up, surprised. \"Me, Sergeant?\"\n\n\n\n\"Different assignment, same destination. Move out.\"\n\n\n\nWe followed Cooper out of the operations center into the cold desert night. Stars filled the sky, so many they seemed to crowd each other out. Our breath made clouds in front of us as we walked across the courtyard toward Building C\u2014the one structure at Bravo Mike I'd never entered.\n\n\n\nCooper unlocked a series of doors, each requiring different keys and codes. The deeper we went, the heavier the doors became. The final door was steel, at least six inches thick, with no handle on our side. Cooper entered a code, placed his palm on a scanner, and stepped back as the door slid open.\n\n\n\n\"Inside,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe room beyond was small and spartanly furnished\u2014a few chairs arranged in a line facing a reinforced window that took up most of one wall. The window looked out on nothing but darkness. Four other airmen were already seated, staring straight ahead. I recognized Martinez and Rogers from our shift rotation. The other two were from different rotations\u2014Peterson and Chang, I thought.\n\n\n\nNatalie took a seat, and I sat beside her. Cooper remained by the door, checking his watch.\n\n\n\n\"You are here to observe only,\" he said, his voice flatter than usual. \"What happens outside that window is classified Level Eight. You will not discuss it with anyone, not even each other, after you leave this room. Is that clear?\"\n\n\n\nSix voices answered as one: \"Yes, Sergeant.\"\n\n\n\nCooper nodded once. \"ETA three minutes.\"\n\n\n\nNo one spoke after that. I glanced at Natalie, but her focus was on the window. Outside, I could now make out a perimeter road running along the base fence line. Floodlights activated suddenly, illuminating the area in harsh white light. In the distance, dust plumes rose from the desert floor.\n\n\n\nA convoy of vehicles appeared, racing toward the base at high speed. Five vehicles\u2014three armored personnel carriers sandwiching two heavy transport trucks. They swerved occasionally, as if avoiding obstacles, but maintained their heading toward the base.\n\n\n\nBehind them, at first just a dark mass against the horizon, something moved. Something big. As it neared the floodlights' range, I caught glimpses of shape\u2014impossibly tall, with multiple limbs that seemed to both walk and flow across the desert floor. It moved with fluid grace despite its size, closing the gap on the convoy with each stride.\n\n\n\nMy mouth went dry. Beside me, Natalie's breathing quickened. I felt her hand find mine in the darkness, gripping tight.\n\n\n\nThe door behind us opened. Cooper stepped back in, his face drained of color. He looked at each of us in turn, then at the window where the creature was now clearly visible\u2014a nightmare fifty feet tall, with jointed legs like a spider's and a mockery of a human face stretched across what might have been a head.\n\n\n\n\"You are to watch only,\" he said, his voice hollow. \"Under no circumstances are you to interfere or attempt to engage the entity. This is a direct order.\"\n\nThe sirens started wailing mid-sentence, cutting through Cooper's order with a sound like steel being tortured. I jolted in my chair. Everyone did. The floodlights outside flickered twice, then blazed even brighter, painting harsh shadows across the desert.\n\n\n\nCooper's radio crackled. He pulled it from his belt, listened for three seconds, then slammed it back into place.\n\n\n\n\"Stay here,\" he barked, and was gone through the door before anyone could respond.\n\n\n\nI turned back to the window. The convoy had reached the outer fence, the lead vehicle smashing through the gate in a shower of chain-link and concrete. Behind them, the thing\u2014Goliath, I heard someone whisper\u2014moved with a grace that defied its bulk. Its limbs bent at impossible angles, covering ground in loping strides that ate up the distance between it and the perimeter wall.\n\n\n\n\"Jesus,\" Martinez breathed next to me. \"It has to be thirty feet tall.\"\n\n\n\nIt was bigger than that. Much bigger.\n\n\n\nNatalie's fingers dug into my sleeve, but I couldn't look away from the window to check on her. The creature moved like nothing I'd ever seen\u2014not running exactly, but flowing, each limb finding perfect placement despite its speed. It reached the perimeter wall just as the last convoy vehicle cleared the inner gate.\n\n\n\nPersonnel scattered across the compound. Some ran for cover. Others moved with purpose toward defensive positions I hadn't known existed. Mounted guns emerged from hidden emplacements along the wall. Soldiers poured from barracks buildings in various states of dress, grabbing weapons from an armory truck that had appeared in the center of the base.\n\n\n\nGoliath hit the wall and didn't slow. Its front limbs\u2014too many, I couldn't count them\u2014latched onto the concrete. The thing's body twisted, and it went up and over the thirty-foot barrier like a spider scaling a bathroom tile. No hesitation. No effort.\n\n\n\nSomething caught in my throat.\n\n\n\n\"They can't stop it,\" Chang said from the end of the row. \"Nothing could stop that.\"\n\n\n\nA single shot cracked through the night. Then another. Then a barrage as panic spread through the ranks outside. The guards on the wall opened fire against orders, their discipline crumbling in the face of the impossible. Tracer rounds cut bright paths through the darkness, passing through the creature's body as if through smoke. It didn't flinch. Didn't even seem to notice.\n\n\n\nOnce inside the wall, Goliath moved with terrible purpose. It surged toward the nearest cluster of soldiers, limbs extended. I couldn't see clearly what happened next\u2014just bodies flying, blood spraying in patterns too perfect to be real. Screams reached us even through the reinforced glass.\n\n\n\n\"We have to help,\" I said, half-rising. No one moved with me.\n\n\n\n\"Orders,\" Rogers muttered, though he looked sick.\n\n\n\nOutside, Cooper appeared from a side door, running toward a group of soldiers who'd formed a defensive line. He grabbed a radio from one of them, shouting orders we couldn't hear. More personnel emerged from buildings, taking up positions, creating a corridor through which the convoy could pass.\n\n\n\nThe trucks and APCs made straight for the largest structure on base\u2014a hangar I'd only ever seen from the outside. Doors three stories high began to slide open, revealing darkness within.\n\n\n\nGoliath paused, its head-like upper section swiveling toward the hangar. It changed direction instantly, abandoning a group of soldiers it had been cutting through. It moved toward the convoy with new urgency.\n\n\n\nCooper saw it coming. He directed soldiers to fall back, waving them toward secondary positions. Too slow. Far too slow. Goliath covered the distance in seconds, looming over Cooper and the men around him. For a heartbeat, nothing happened. Cooper stood his ground, sidearm raised in a gesture that seemed almost comical given the scale of the threat.\n\n\n\nThe creature's limb lashed out faster than I could track. Cooper disappeared in its grip, lifted high above the ground. For a terrible moment I could see him struggling, a tiny figure against the night sky.\n\n\n\nThen he came apart.\n\n\n\nThere's no other way to say it. His body separated into pieces, and those pieces fell like rain onto the men below. The blood looked black under the floodlights. A sound escaped Natalie beside me\u2014not quite a scream, something smaller and more broken.\n\n\n\nI found myself on my feet without remembering standing. My palm pressed against the glass, useless. Natalie's nails dug into my other arm, breaking skin. I barely felt it. Outside, soldiers died by the dozens. Some shot themselves rather than be taken by the creature. Others ran blindly, only to be snatched up and torn apart.\n\n\n\nThe convoy reached the hangar. The middle truck backed in first, followed by the others. Soldiers swarmed around them, unloading something long and cylindrical from the lead vehicle. It took eight men to carry it, moving with urgent care toward the depths of the hangar. Whatever it was, they treated it like it might shatter\u2014or explode.\n\n\n\nOnce it disappeared inside, the hangar doors began to close. Goliath froze in place. Its limbs retracted slightly, drawing close to its body. The misshapen head turned, scanning the compound with a deliberate motion that somehow conveyed intelligence.\n\n\n\nThen, with the same fluid motion it had approached with, it retreated. It scaled the wall again, dropping to the other side, and moved back into the desert darkness from which it had emerged. Within seconds, it was just a silhouette against the stars. Then nothing at all.\n\n\n\nThe silence that followed seemed heavier than the chaos before it. On base, survivors stumbled between bodies. Medics appeared with stretchers that quickly ran out. The wounded screamed for help that couldn't come fast enough. The dead stared upward, their faces masks of terror frozen in place.\n\n\n\nNo one in our viewing room spoke. What was there to say? We'd watched dozens of our fellow airmen die in ways that defied understanding. We'd seen our commanding officer torn to pieces. We'd witnessed something impossible.\n\n\n\nWe sat there until the first gray light of dawn crept over the eastern mountains. No one came to dismiss us or give new orders. The six of us stayed, shoulder to shoulder, afraid to be the first to move, afraid to break whatever fragile thing was keeping us sane.\n\n\n\nThe blood on my arm dried where Natalie's nails had dug in. I didn't wipe it away. It was the only thing that felt real.\n\nI woke to a fist pounding on my door. Didn't remember falling asleep. My clothes felt glued to my skin, stiff with dried sweat. The clock read 09:17.\n\n\n\n\"Wilson! Open up!\"\n\n\n\nMilitary police. Two of them filled my doorway in combat gear with sidearms unholstered. Behind them stood a man in a dark suit who looked like he'd stepped out of a government pamphlet\u2014crew cut, blank expression, unremarkable in every way that screamed federal agent.\n\n\n\n\"Come with us,\" the taller MP said.\n\n\n\nI didn't ask questions. Didn't even change clothes. The base looked wrong in daylight\u2014bloodstains on concrete, bullet casings scattered like seeds, body bags lined up outside the infirmary. Twenty-seven of them. I counted twice.\n\n\n\nThey led me to the admin building and into a windowless room with a metal table bolted to the floor. The suit followed, closing the door with a click that echoed like a gunshot.\n\n\n\n\"James Wilson,\" he said, not a question. \"I'm Agent Reed. You're going to tell me everything you saw.\"\n\n\n\nThe questions went on for hours. Each answer recorded, timestamped, filed away. I told him about the convoy, the creature, Cooper. My throat went dry. They didn't offer water.\n\n\n\n\"Did the entity communicate with anyone?\" Reed asked.\n\n\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\n\n\"Did you observe any weaknesses?\"\n\n\n\n\"Bullets passed through it.\"\n\n\n\n\"Were there any unusual smells, sounds, or atmospheric disturbances?\"\n\n\n\nI remembered the stillness before it appeared. \"No.\"\n\n\n\nMore questions. Same ones rephrased. Reed checking my face for lies I wasn't telling. Eventually he slid papers across the table\u2014pages of legal text with red tabs marking signature lines.\n\n\n\n\"Standard non-disclosure agreement,\" he said.\n\n\n\nNothing standard about it. Phrases jumped out like warnings: \"lifetime obligation,\" \"matters of national security,\" \"prosecution for treason,\" \"minimum penalty.\"\n\n\n\n\"What happens if I don't sign?\"\n\n\n\nReed didn't blink. \"Prison. For a very long time.\"\n\n\n\nI signed.\n\n\n\nThey released me at sunset. I stumbled back to my quarters past clean-up crews hosing blood into drains. No sign of the bodies. No sign anything had happened except for sections of missing wall and bullet holes in concrete.\n\n\n\nMy room had been searched. Drawers left open, bed stripped, personal items moved. I collapsed anyway, too empty to care.\n\n\n\nAt 06:00 the next morning, transfer orders arrived\u2014Osan Air Base, South Korea. Effective immediately. A corporal I'd never seen before handed me the paperwork and said I had two hours to pack.\n\n\n\nI tried calling Natalie's quarters. No answer. Went to her barracks. Found it empty, bed stripped, closet cleaned out. Asked around. No one had seen her.\n\n\n\nForty minutes before my transport left, I found Martinez loading his gear into a truck.\n\n\n\n\"You seen Bane?\" I asked.\n\n\n\nHe glanced around before answering. \"Ramstein.\"\n\n\n\n\"Germany?\"\n\n\n\n\"Shipped out at dawn. They're scattering everyone who was in that room.\" He slammed the truck door shut. \"Don't try to contact anyone. They're watching.\"\n\n\n\nThe flight to Osan lasted sixteen hours. I spent it staring at the seat back, replaying that night, seeing Cooper pulled apart, hearing the screams cut short. The airman next to me asked twice if I was okay. I lied both times.\n\n\n\nSouth Korea blurred past. Days became weeks. I did my job. Filed reports. Followed orders. At night, I wrote letters to Natalie that came back stamped \"UNDELIVERABLE.\" Sent emails that bounced. Called numbers that didn't connect.\n\n\n\nAfter three months, a message reached my terminal: \"Stop trying. \u2014N\"\n\n\n\nI stopped.\n\n\n\nThe nightmares started in month four. Always the same\u2014Goliath finding me, lifting me like it had Cooper, my body coming apart like cheap fabric. I'd wake twisted in sheets, throat raw from screams I hadn't heard myself make.\n\n\n\nMy roommate requested a transfer. Can't blame him.\n\n\n\nThe military doctor prescribed pills that turned the dreams to static. Better than watching myself die every night. I took them until they stopped working, then got stronger ones. Worked my way through the pharmacy until nothing helped.\n\n\n\nFound bourbon instead.\n\n\n\nFinished my service in 2013 and settled in Denver. Rented a one-bedroom near downtown and landed an IT security job I could do half-drunk. The HR manager who hired me had a brother in the Air Force. Military discount, she called it.\n\n\n\nTried therapy. VA doc with a beard and coffee breath who nodded at my vague descriptions of \"combat trauma\" and wrote prescriptions that joined the others in my medicine cabinet. Couldn't tell him the truth. Couldn't tell anyone.\n\n\n\nTuesday nights I'd meet other vets at a bar off Colfax. They talked about Afghanistan, Iraq, IEDs, and firefights. Real horrors, human horrors. I'd nod like I understood, drink until their faces blurred, then stumble home to my empty apartment.\n\n\n\nSix years passed. I functioned. Held jobs. Dated women who eventually got tired of the parts of me I couldn't explain. Drank less, worked more. Started running until my lungs burned and my legs went numb. Pain helped. Made other things fade.\n\n\n\nIn 2019, I was doing contract work for a Seattle firm. Security audit, two weeks on-site. Boring work in a rainy city. One night I walked into a twenty-four-hour diner near my hotel, soaked from a sudden downpour.\n\n\n\nAnd there she was. Natalie. Sitting in a corner booth with medical textbooks spread around her, red pen between her teeth, hair pulled back in the same tight bun. Six years older but unmistakable.\n\n\n\nShe looked up as the bell above the door jingled. Our eyes met. Neither of us moved.\n\n\n\n\"Wilson,\" she finally said, red pen hovering.\n\n\n\n\"Bane.\"\n\n\n\nThe waitress appeared, coffee pot in hand. I ordered a cup I didn't want. Walked to Natalie's booth and sat without asking. She closed her books, one by one.\n\n\n\n\"You look...\" she started.\n\n\n\n\"Older.\"\n\n\n\n\"I was going to say dry. It's pouring outside.\"\n\n\n\n\"I just came in.\"\n\n\n\nAwkward silence stretched between us, years of it packed into seconds. I suddenly couldn't remember why I'd approached her. What was there to say?\n\n\n\nShe broke first. \"Do you still have the dreams?\"\n\n\n\nThe question hit like cold water. No preamble, no small talk. Just straight to the wound.\n\n\n\n\"Every night,\" I admitted.\n\n\n\n\"Me too.\" She pushed a textbook aside. \"Sometimes I think I see it on the street, just for a second. A shape that doesn't fit. A shadow that moves wrong.\"\n\n\n\n\"I check the locks twice,\" I said. \"Always.\"\n\n\n\n\"Three times,\" she countered with half a smile.\n\n\n\nWe talked until the waitress stopped refilling our cups. Traded theories about what Goliath was, why the government covered it up, where it came from. Compared transfer locations, dead ends, nightmares. Discovered we'd both tried the same medications with the same results.\n\n\n\nI came back the next night. And the next. My two-week contract stretched to three. We moved from the diner to a bar, from the bar to walks along the waterfront. On my last night in Seattle, she invited me back to her apartment.\n\n\n\nIt wasn't romantic. We were two broken pieces that somehow fit together. Two people who didn't have to lie about the worst night of their lives. The relief of that was better than any painkiller.\n\n\n\nI extended my stay again. Found local work. Moved into a studio twenty minutes from her place. We dated like normal people\u2014dinner, movies, weekend trips to the coast. But underneath it ran a current of shared trauma that kept us close when any sane person would've walked away.\n\n\n\n\"Sometimes I think they put us in different countries to see if we'd break,\" she said one night, fingers tracing circles on my chest. \"Like an experiment.\"\n\n\n\n\"Did you?\"\n\n\n\n\"Break? No.\" She shook her head against my shoulder. \"Bend, maybe. You?\"\n\n\n\n\"Same.\"\n\n\n\nWhen she moved in with me six months later, the nightmares came less often. By the time I proposed a year after that, they'd faded to once a week. Sometimes less.\n\n\n\nWe got married in a courthouse with two strangers as witnesses. No family, no friends. Just us, the way it had been since that night in Room 217. Easier that way. Fewer questions about how we met, where we served, why we woke up screaming.\n\n\n\nNatalie finished nursing school. I built my security consulting business. We bought a small house in the suburbs with good schools nearby. Planted a garden. Got a dog. Normal life. Suburban life. The kind of life that feels like a shield against darker things.\n\n\n\nRobert was born on a cold January morning in 2022. Seven pounds, four ounces. Perfect in every way. The moment I held him, something shifted inside me\u2014a wall coming down or a light coming on. I'd been broken for so long I'd forgotten what wholeness felt like.\n\n\n\n\"He has your eyes,\" Natalie said, exhausted and beautiful in her hospital bed.\n\n\n\n\"Your nose.\"\n\n\n\n\"Poor kid.\"\n\n\n\nWe brought him home to a nursery painted soft blue. A mobile hung above his crib\u2014stars and moons spinning in lazy circles. At night I'd hold him while Natalie slept, watching his tiny chest rise and fall, listening to his breath.\n\n\n\nThe nightmares stopped completely. Not fewer\u2014gone. For the first time in thirteen years, I slept through the night. Every night.\n\n\n\nWe settled into routines. Diaper changes, midnight feedings, first smiles. Natalie worked three twelve-hour shifts at the hospital while I stayed home with Robert. Then we'd switch\u2014she'd take over while I caught up on client work. We were tired in the good way parents are tired. Normal tired.\n\n\n\nI built a security system for our house. Motion sensors, cameras, smart locks. Natalie pretended not to notice I checked the footage every morning. I pretended not to notice the bat she kept by the bed. Old habits, worn smooth like river stones.\n\n\n\nSome nights we'd sit on the back porch after Robert went down, drinking beer and watching stars come out. Not talking much. Not needing to. The weight we carried had become familiar, almost comfortable in its constancy.\n\n\n\n\"Do you ever wonder if it's still out there?\" she asked once.\n\n\n\n\"No,\" I lied.\n\n\n\n\"Me neither,\" she lied back.\n\n\n\nBut we both knew better. Something that large, that impossible, doesn't just disappear. The government didn't lock us down because it was a one-time event. They did it because they knew it would happen again.\n\n\n\nStill, we had built something good. Something real. A life filled with first steps and client meetings and Sunday pancakes. A life where Goliath was just a fading memory, a story we'd never tell our son.\n\nI pulled the stack of mail from our box and thumbed through it on the walk back to the house. Bills. Credit card offer. Something from Natalie's sister. And beneath that, a manila envelope with no return address.\n\n\n\nMy fingers knew before my brain caught up. Same weight. Same texture. Same government issue I hadn't held in thirteen years.\n\n\n\nI stopped in the middle of the sidewalk. Our neighbor's sprinklers ticked through their cycle. A kid rode past on a bike, baseball card clicking in the spokes. I turned the envelope over and checked the postmark. Rachel, Nevada. \n\n\n\nThe only thing in Rachel was dust and the road to Bravo Mike.\n\n\n\nInside our kitchen, I set the other mail down and grabbed a knife from the drawer. Careful cut along the top edge. Clean. Controlled. The knife shook anyway.\n\n\n\nInside was a note card. Three words in red ink: \"He is coming.\"\n\n\n\nThe handwriting wasn't Cooper's. Cooper was dead. I'd watched him die. But someone from Bravo Mike had sent this. Someone who knew.\n\n\n\nI fumbled for my phone and hit Natalie's contact. It rang five times before she answered.\n\n\n\n\"Hey,\" she said, sounds of the hospital bustling behind her. \"I'm between patients. Everything okay?\"\n\n\n\n\"No.\" My voice came out wrong\u2014tight and small. \"You need to come home. Now.\"\n\n\n\nA pause. \"What happened?\"\n\n\n\n\"Bravo Mike.\"\n\n\n\nTwo words. That's all it took. I heard her breathing change.\n\n\n\n\"I'll tell them it's an emergency,\" she said. \"Twenty minutes.\"\n\n\n\nI hung up and opened the hall closet. Behind winter coats and shoe boxes were two black duffel bags we'd packed years ago. Grab-and-go bags with cash, documents, clothes, first aid kits. Things we hoped we'd never need. I pulled them out and set them by the front door.\n\n\n\nNext was Robert's room. He was napping, one arm flung above his head, blanket kicked off. I gathered his essentials as quietly as I could\u2014diapers, wipes, formula, clothes, his favorite stuffed dog. Packed it all in his diaper bag and added it to the pile.\n\n\n\nNatalie burst through the door nineteen minutes after my call. Her face was flushed, hair coming loose from her bun.\n\n\n\n\"What is it?\" she demanded.\n\n\n\nI handed her the card. She read it three times, lips moving silently.\n\n\n\n\"Who sent this?\" she finally asked.\n\n\n\n\"Postmark says Rachel. Only thing near there is the base.\"\n\n\n\n\"We destroyed all records of where we were going.\"\n\n\n\n\"Someone kept track,\" I said.\n\n\n\nShe set the card down like it might bite. \"You think it's real? Not someone messing with us?\"\n\n\n\n\"Who else knows about him? About what happened? The government buried it all.\"\n\n\n\nShe nodded, already moving toward our bedroom. \"How much time do we have?\"\n\n\n\n\"No idea.\"\n\n\n\nWe'd rehearsed this scenario in our heads for years. What we'd take. Where we'd go. How fast we could disappear. Now that it was happening, the plan felt flimsy, full of holes.\n\n\n\n\"I'll get Robert,\" Natalie said, voice steady despite the fear in her eyes. \"You load the car.\"\n\n\n\nI grabbed our bags and headed outside. The afternoon sun cast long shadows across our driveway as I popped the trunk and arranged our things. Checked the gas tank\u2014three-quarters full. Not ideal, but enough to get distance before we needed to stop.\n\n\n\nSomething felt wrong. I paused, keys in hand, listening. No birds. No neighborhood sounds. Just the faint hiss of someone's sprinkler two houses down. It was too quiet.\n\n\n\nNatalie appeared with Robert bundled against her chest, still sleepy from his nap.\n\n\n\n\"Car seat,\" she said.\n\n\n\nI helped her secure him in the back, his tiny face scrunched in confusion. He sensed our panic. Kids always know.\n\n\n\n\"Where are we going?\" Natalie asked, climbing into the passenger seat.\n\n\n\n\"East. Away from the coast.\" I started the engine. \"We can figure out details once we're moving.\"\n\n\n\n\"Should we try to contact the others? Martinez? Chang?\"\n\n\n\n\"Martinez is overseas. No idea where Chang ended up.\" I backed out of the driveway. \"Try Michael. He's in Portland.\"\n\n\n\nNatalie pulled out her phone while I scanned the street. Still unnaturally quiet. No dog walkers. No kids playing. Nobody checking mail.\n\n\n\n\"Voicemail,\" she said after a moment. \"Michael, it's Natalie Bane from Bravo Mike. If you're getting this, you might be in danger. Call me immediately.\" She left her number and hung up.\n\n\n\nRobert started crying as we turned onto the main road. Not his usual fussy cry\u2014this was different. Frightened. Natalie twisted in her seat to comfort him.\n\n\n\n\"It's okay, baby. We're just going on a trip.\"\n\n\n\nThe lie sounded hollow even to me.\n\n\n\nI hit the gas harder than necessary, tires chirping on asphalt. The car picked up speed as we approached the intersection that would take us to the highway. Three more blocks. Two. One.\n\n\n\nThe ground trembled. So slight I might have missed it if I hadn't been waiting for something. Anything. A vibration that traveled up through the wheels and into the steering column.\n\n\n\nI checked the rearview mirror. Four blocks back, between houses, something moved. Something large. A distortion in the air like heat waves, but sharper. More defined.\n\n\n\n\"James,\" Natalie said, voice barely audible.\n\n\n\n\"I see it.\"\n\n\n\nRobert's cries grew louder. I pressed the accelerator to the floor. The engine roared in protest as we shot through a yellow light and onto the entrance ramp.\n\n\n\n\"Call Michael again,\" I said.\n\n\n\nNatalie tried three times. No answer.\n\n\n\n\"Where are we going?\" she asked, strain breaking through her calm facade.\n\n\n\nThe truth formed in my stomach like a stone. \"I don't know.\"\n\n\n\nGoliath was back. The creature that had torn apart Cooper and dozens of others thirteen years ago had found us. Whether it had been hunting us all this time or just now picked up our trail didn't matter. It was here.\n\n\n\nI merged onto the highway at twenty over the speed limit, weaving between cars. In the back seat, Robert's cries had softened to whimpers. Natalie reached back to touch his leg, her hand trembling slightly.\n\n\n\n\"How did it find us?\" she asked.\n\n\n\n\"I don't know that either.\"\n\n\n\nThirteen years of nightmares. Thirteen years of jumping at shadows and checking locks. Thirteen years of telling ourselves we were safe, that it was over. All blown away by three words on a note card.\n\n\n\nI pushed the car faster, watching the rearview mirror more than the road ahead. Nothing followed\u2014no massive shape flowing over asphalt, no spider-like limbs reaching between vehicles. But that didn't mean it wasn't coming.\n\n\n\n\"We need a plan,\" Natalie said. \"Somewhere it can't find us.\"\n\n\n\nBut we both knew there was no such place. We'd seen what Goliath could do. How it moved. How it hunted. How it killed.\n\n\n\n\"We keep driving,\" I said, knuckles white on the steering wheel. \"We don't stop until we have to.\"\n\n\n\nThe highway stretched before us, carrying us away from our home, away from the life we'd built. But not away from the nightmare. Never away from that.\n\n\n\nIt had only just begun.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------  \nHope you enjoyed this Long CreepyPasta!

    "selftext": "*TW*: Suicide\n\n- 2\/4\/44\nIt\u2019s been 12 days since the bombs were dropped. I figured keeping a journal would help keep me sane. Physically I\u2019m fine. We have enough food to keep us alive. For now. \nRachel says she isn\u2019t feeling well. I gave her some Tylenol and it worked only for an hour or so. I told her to take some more. She spends most of the day sleeping.\nHarold is about as hopeful as I am. He\u2019s putting on a brave face for Ellie. But I know him. He\u2019s as scared as I am. But I\u2019d hate to see them fall apart. They just got married a week before this all happened.\nHarold\u2019s spending most of his time sitting next to the radio. He keeps fiddling with the  buttons, as if he knows what he\u2019s doing. All he ever gets back is static. Sometimes it\u2019s louder than other times but that\u2019s all we hear. \nOur gun has three bullets\n\n- 2\/11\/44\nI heard Ellie singing yesterday. Some old song from the 20s\n\u201cOooo\u2026 blinded by the lights\u2026 I\u2019m not sleeping\u2026 feel your touch\u2026\u201d\nThat one line over and over again. I hear a bit of laughter and when I peek into their room I see Harold dancing around, laughing with her.\nIt made me smile. Which is a rarity these days.\nRachel hasn\u2019t been feeling a lot better. I slept by her the other night. It was peaceful, reminded me a bit of before we had to leave home. It\u2019s odd, really. I know we\u2019re in the same city but down here\u2026 just feels like another world.\nWe still have enough food.\nOur gun has three bullets\n\n- 2\/20\/44\nEvery day is starting to feel the same. Rachel sleeping, Harold messing with the radio, Ellie singing to herself. \nEvery so often we\u2019d play card games together but it\u2019s not fun anymore. We\u2019ve basically all mastered the few card games we know. Go fish\u2026 war\u2026 poker\u2026 that\u2019s it. I\u2019ve taken to playing solitaire by myself while the others do their thing. But still it\u2019s not the same.\nOur gun has three bullets.\n\n- 3\/1\/44\nOur generator is running out of gas. Food is starting to get low. I\u2019ve yet to tell Rachel any of this. Speaking of Rachel she\u2019s not getting any better. I used the last of the Tylenol. It wasn\u2019t enough. Didn\u2019t seem to help at all.\nHarold wants to leave the Bunker. All of us are telling him it\u2019s a bad idea. He thinks he can take the gas mask we have and just stroll out there, but I\u2019m not even sure it will work. He said verbatim: \u201cIf there\u2019s even a chance of there being supplies up there I\u2019ll take it.\u201d Ellie was literally on her knees begging him not to go. He finally saw reason and said he\u2019ll stay.\nOur gun has three bullets.\n\n- 3\/44\nHarold left. The stubborn bastard took the gas mask, the flashlight and just left. He left a note saying he\u2019ll be back in a day. Ellie spent the whole day in bed crying. It broke my soul seeing her fall apart. \nAs furious as I am right now, maybe if he does come back it will be worth it. Maybe he\u2019ll get medicine for Rachel.\nOur gun has three bullets\n\n- 3\/44\nThe box of cards fell apart. Cards are all over the floor. I can\u2019t be bothered to pick them up.\nRachel has gotten worse. She\u2019s started to cough up blood. Harold needs to come back. HE HAS TO. No way he\u2019d just leave for the sake of it. No. Don\u2019t think like that. He\u2019s coming back. Rachel will be fine. Ellie will be ok. It\u2019s ok. I\u2019m fine. He\u2019s coming back. He\u2019s coming back.\nOur gun has three bullets.\n\n- 3\/44\nRachel hasn\u2019t woken up yet. I\u2019m scared. Ellie hasn\u2019t left her room yet. Harold hasn\u2019t come back yet\nOur gun has three bullets.\n\n- 3\/44\nRachel isn\u2019t awake. I slept beside her again last night. It felt different. I didn\u2019t feel like it used to. We weren\u2019t in our home before this all happened.\nWe were just in a bunker.\nHarold hasn\u2019t come back yet. I finally checked on Ellie today.\nI found her in her room. She was on the floor.\nOur gun has two bullets.\n\n- \nRachel is still asleep. She was always a heavy sleeper. I sang a little song to her while she slept. It was nice.\nI\u2019m not sure what to do with Ellie. The whole bunker is starting to smell.\nOur gun has two bullets.\n\n- \nHarold came back.\nHe came back today\nWith nothing.\nNothing. \n*NOTHING*\nThat stupid fucking bastard just came back like it was NOTHING!\nI did what I needed to.\nOur gun has one bullet\n\n- \nI\u2019m leaving today. \nMe and Rachel are going to go out of this bunker. \nIt will be beautiful.\nHarold and Ellie will stay here. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be happy together.\nI\u2019ll pick her up and go.\nIt will be beautiful.\nBeautiful.\nWhen she wakes up she\u2019ll smile with me. "

    "selftext": "I'm hiding in my closet.  \n911 is on the way.  \nI\u2019m on Reddit because\u2014hell, I don\u2019t know. It feels safer doing *something* while I wait.  \nTyping helps me not think about the sound I just heard downstairs. The one that didn\u2019t sound like the house settling.\n\nYou're probably wondering why I\u2019m crouched between old shoes and a box of tangled cords with my phone brightness on 1% and my heart trying to punch through my ribs.  \nIt started with a photo.\n\nAbout three days ago, this weird sketch started making rounds on the internet. A creepy pencil drawing of some guy\u2019s face\u2014wide eyes, weird smile, that grainy texture that made it feel like it was pulled from a police report or one of those missing-person flyers that never got taken down.\n\nPeople were posting it as a joke.  \n\"Uncanny NPC energy.\"  \n\"Looks like someone who\u2019d stand too close in line.\"  \n\"Every small-town gas station employee at 3 AM.\"  \nThat kind of crap. Meme-bait.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a big thing. A few reposts here and there, mostly people just reacting to how weird it looked. Nobody said much else.\n\nBut I couldn\u2019t stop staring at it.\n\nIt looked like me.\n\nNot \u201csort of\u201d or \u201cvaguely.\u201d I mean *exactly*. My hair. My eyes. Even the weird way one side of my mouth pulls slightly higher when I smile. It was like someone had taken a photo of me without my knowing and redrawn it just enough to look unfamiliar at first glance. But once I saw it\u2014*really* saw it\u2014I couldn\u2019t unsee it.\n\nI reverse image searched it.  \nNothing.  \nNo origin. No artist. No explanation.  \nJust reposts. Same sketch. No context.\n\nI even checked the metadata on a download blank. Just labeled \u201cimage.jpeg.\u201d Like it never had a source.\n\nThat was two nights ago.  \nThat night, I had a dream. I was in my living room, sitting on the couch, scrolling Reddit. Nothing was off, except it was *dead silent*. No fridge hum. No traffic. No wind. And behind me, reflected in the black TV screen\u2026 I could see a silhouette.\n\nJust standing there.  \nStill.  \nWatching.  \nAnd in the dream, I remember saying out loud, \u201cThat\u2019s not me.\u201d  \nI woke up sweating. Couldn\u2019t shake the feeling.\n\nI deleted the image immediately.  \nCleared every copy.  \nDid a full reset just to be sure.  \nDidn\u2019t matter.\n\nBecause just now\u2026 just minutes ago\u2026  \nI went to grab something from the kitchen.\n\nThe drawer I keep my printed photos in\u2014the one that\u2019s always closed, tucked under my microwave\u2014was open.\n\nI didn\u2019t open it.\n\nAnd sitting right on top, like it had just been placed there, was a piece of paper. Folded twice, perfectly square. I knew what it was before I even touched it.\n\nI didn\u2019t unfold it.  \nI couldn\u2019t.\n\nI ran.  \nNow I\u2019m in the closet.\n\nStill typing.  \nStill waiting.\n\nI don\u2019t know what the hell is happening.  \nI don\u2019t know why this is happening to *me*.\n\nBut I swear to God, there\u2019s someone in my house.\n\nAnd I can hear the silverware drawer rattling.\n\n(This is my attempt of creepypasta. What can I improve on?)"

    "selftext": "Growing up, I always knew that I had the coolest dad in the world. He never breathed down my neck to have perfect grades and he took me on tons of trips to different cities all the time. My room is full of souvenirs from all the places we visited. The coolest thing about him was that he was an animator for Cartoon Network. This meant that several of my favorite cartoons were some of the stuff he worked on. Whether I was watching reruns of old shows or watching the latest episodes of my new favorites, there was a good chance my dad was involved in their production.\n\nHe even brought home copies of some storyboards he was working on. It was so cool being the kid in school who had sneak previews of upcoming shows. My friends always circled around me to read the storyboards with me whenever we hung out. It was almost like reading a comic book. My friends eventually asked me if my dad had any lost episodes in his collection. Lost episodes were something we gossiped about often due to their incredibly elusive nature. They were highly obscure pieces of media that had corrupted versions of your favorite shows. I remember reading one blog post where some guy said he saw an episode of Ed Edd n Eddy where the trio died in a traffic accident after Eddy stole a car. Another person mentioned there being an episode of Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends where Mac imagined the entire show.\n\nWe were all a bit skeptical if those episodes were even real, but my friend George was the most invested into finding them. He was the daredevil of the group. George gladly volunteered to explore haunted houses in the neighborhood and climb over the school fence when the teachers weren't looking. One time he invited us over to his place to watch a rated R horror movie and convinced us that it was all based on a true story. I don't think that guy can go a single day without getting an adredline rush.\n\n\" Your dad totally has to know what a lost episode is. I bet everyone in the industry trades lost episodes with each other and then they make those creepypasta to tease fans,\" George said to me at lunch one day. He has brought the subject up again and seemed intent on finding a lost episode.\n\n\" I don't know, man. You sure those aren't just urban legends? Nobody's even found one of those lost episodes for real. It's all just talk,\" I replied back.\n\n\" Sounds to me you're just too scared to go looking. You almost pissed yourself during movie night last time.\"\n\n\" Stop exaggerating! If you wanna find an episode so badly, how about we search my dad's laptop. Let's see what he's hiding.\"\n\nGeorge came over to my place the next day to search the computer. My dad wouldn't return home from the studio for at least an hour so we had plenty of time to get it done. I typed in the password and scanned through all his files for anything that caught my eye. Nothing really stood out at first. It was just a bunch of character design sheets and storyboards from his cartoons. Some of it was stuff I've already seen before. After 20 minutes of searching, I was beginning to lose hope when a chatroom popped up on the screen.\n\nKilljoy88: Hey man you really outdid yourself with that episode you sent us! I wasn't expecting there to be that much blood!\n\nBoth of our eyes flared up. This looked like it could be something good. I checked the chat history to see that my dad had sent a message with a video file attached. I eagerly gave it a click.\n\nA video popped up that showed the intro of The Loud House. I immediately got excited cause that was a show I had tons of fun watching. After the intro, a title card that read \" What Happened to Lincoln?\" appeared.\n\nThe episode began with Lincoln's family putting up missing posters for him around town. They all looked incredibly miserable like they were moments away from sobbing their eyes out. The animation was also a bit sketchy and had a choppy frame rate. Characters often went off model to the point they had uncanny valley expressions a lot of the time.\n\nThe episode then did a flashback to a scene of Lincoln exploring a comicbook shop that was painted a cobalt shade of blue. Lincoln narrated how this was a new shop town that was rumored to have rarest comics imagineable. This version of Lincoln was voiced by an adult man, maybe as placeholder until the episode was ready to air.  Lincoln entered the shop and was shocked how grungy the place looked. Colorless brick walls surrounded him and noticeable cobwebs grew from the corners. \n\nLincoln approached the cashier to ask him if they had Ace Savvy Obscuritas, an issue of the Ace Savvy comic series that only has 13 known copies. Hearing this, an orange haired kid walked up to Lincoln and said he was looking for the same issue.\n\n\" Isn't that Jason?\" George asked.\n\n\" What?\"\n\n\" Jason Smithera. The kid who went missing about 3 months ago.\"\n\nI paused the video and studied the boy's face. George was right. The boy in the cartoon definitely resembled Jason. He was a kid from our school who suddenly went missing one day. The police searched hard to find him, but nobody had any clue where he could be. I still remember seeing his parents tearfuly hang up missing posters around the neighborhood. He has frizzy orange hair, bright blue eyes, heavy freckles and a birthmark in his forehead. The kid in the cartoon was the spitting image of him.\n\n\" That's one heck of a coincidence.\" I resumed the video.\n\nThe cashier was a big burly man with scraggly black hair. He told the boys how fortunate they were since he just so happened to have the last two copies. He led them down to the basement where he kept a small collection of dust covered comics. Lincoln and the boy gleefully grabbed the Ace Savvy issues and were about to read them when two men ran up behind them and pressed white cloths to their noses. They struggled to break free, but eventually passed out.\n\nWhen they woke up, they were tied to down to chairs and looked badly bruised.\n\n\"Can someone please let me out!? You can have all my money if that's what you want, just please let me go home! I promise I won't tell anyone what happened!\" The boy screamed to himself in the empty room.\n\nThe voice acting sent chills down my spine. Not only did it sound completely believable, it also sounded like they hired an actual kid actor. It was then I realized how weird it was that a kid was  brought in to record audio for a lost episode especially when they didn't do the same for Lincoln.\n\nEventually, a group of men all dressed in black entered the room with knives in their hands. The animation style was even more sketchy now like the entire thing was roughly done in pencils. The men looked at Lincoln and the boy with eyes full of malicious intent. They pleaded with them with tears rushing down his face, but they only laughed at his pain. They each took turns dragging the knives across his skin before slowly digging it inside. Screams of pure agony blared from the speakers. It sounded way too real. It didn't sound like some kid recording in a booth. It was like the audio was directly recorded from a crime scene.\n\nWhat they did next is something I can hardly describe. They mangled that poor boy, turned him into something that hardly looked human anymore. Lincoln shared the same gruesome fate as him. By the time they were done, blood and bone were scattered all over the room.\n\n\nGeorge and I screamed in disgust at the atrocity we just witnessed. I didn't even know what to believe. Did my dad actually animate a snuff film based on a real kid? He was supposed to be the coolest guy around, not some sick freak. Against my better judgement, I looked back at the chatroom and was horrified even more. The guys bragged about how graphic the gore was and how... cute the boys looked when they were being mangled. Apparently, my dad and other animators had a long history of sharing cartoons where kids being brutally tortured was the main attraction. They would find a real child to drawn a character based on them and insert them into the cartoon of their choice. \n\n The worst part was when one of the guys asked my dad if he could make a lost episode based on me.\n\n\" Only if you pay me double.\" His message said.\n\nThings haven't been the same ever since that day. I've been real distant from my dad and hardly ever hang out with him. Sometimes I worry that he realized I found out his secret. I feel like I should go to the police, but he technically hasn't done anything illegal. Drawn images of children aren't a crime no matter how grotesque and depraved they are.  I still wonder what happened to Jason. Was my dad just capitalizing on a tragedy or was he somehow involved in it? To anyone reading this, please don't search for lost episodes of cartoons. Those episodes are a market for perverts who love to see children suffer. \n\n\nUpdate- I finally did it. I showed my mom what I found on Dad's computer. Naturally, she was utterly repulsed and got into a shouting match with him. Insults were thrown and so were fists. It wasn't long before they got a divorce and I ended up under mom's custody after dad moved away. It hurt tearing their relationship apart like that, but I couldn't stand living under the same roof with that creep any longer. Things have settled down since then, but I noticed a black van patrolling around our neighborhood lately. It's been parked in front of the house and outside my school sporadically throughout the month. I wonder if it's the same van from that video. Is Dad planning on making me the next subject of his snuff films? Right now, I can only hope and pray."

    "selftext": "Iwas about ten years old when it first happened. My parents had sent me to my grandfather\u2019s place for the weekend because they were going away. I didn\u2019t really like him, he was always stern, and I never felt like he liked me. But back then, I had no choice.\n\nMy grandfather's house was old, dark, and always smelled a bit like rotten wood and dust. I still remember walking up the stairs and settling into the room that was meant for me. It was always the same: an old bed, a stiff, uncomfortable chair, and the massive wardrobe in the corner that always creaked, as if it was breathing from the inside.\n\nThat first night, I heard it \u2013 a faint, irregular scraping sound. It came from the hallway. I thought it was the wind or maybe the old house ghost people sometimes talked about. But the longer I listened, the clearer it became \u2013 it was footsteps. Slow, heavy footsteps, drawing nearer to the room.\n\nI pulled the covers over my head and tried to stay quiet, but I couldn\u2019t stop listening. The footsteps came closer, and then\u2026 it suddenly went silent. A heavy breath, and then a cold, black hand slid under the door. I couldn\u2019t see anything, but I could hear it dragging across the floor as the hand moved.\n\nI jumped out of bed, ran to the door, and screamed for my grandfather. But when I entered the room, no one was there. Everything was quiet. No scraping, no hand under the door. Everything was just as it had always been.\n\nI thought it was a nightmare. But over the next few nights, it got worse. I heard the footsteps more clearly each time, getting closer. And eventually, the furniture started to move. The chair where my grandfather always sat began rocking by itself. And the scraping continued, as though someone was trying to crawl out of the wardrobe.\n\nOne particularly cold night, when I was back in the room, I heard the wardrobe open. A dull, slow squeak. I went closer and saw the wardrobe open by itself, even though no one was there. I knew I was about to see something, but what I saw, I couldn\u2019t understand.\n\nThere, in the wardrobe, stood my grandfather. But he didn\u2019t look like the man I knew. His face was twisted, pale, and lifeless, his eyes wide and empty. He didn\u2019t move, but he stared at me, as though waiting for me. Then, with a soft crack, his face began to twist even further, as though his skin was tearing apart. His eyes rolled back, and a cold, hollow laugh filled the room.\n\nI ran out of the room, stumbled down the stairs, and barricaded myself in the living room. When I called my parents the next morning and told them what happened, they just laughed and told me not to make such a fuss. \u201cIt\u2019s just a child\u2019s imagination,\u201d my mom said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been keeping too much to yourself.\u201d\n\nBut I knew what I\u2019d seen. And the worst realization came later \u2013 my grandfather was never really dead. Not in the way you\u2019d expect. Something had stayed behind from him, something dark that had settled in the corners of his house.\n\nNo one believed me. And that was the worst part. Because it kept happening, every time I was in that house. But no one ever belived me.\n\n"

    "selftext": "Alright, a lot of new stuff has happened recently.\n\nIf you\u2019ve seen my last post about a week ago you already know the deal, but here's the gist for people just tuning in. A couple months back, this uncanny valley creature (to which I dubbed \u201cMr. Blank\u201d) started stalking me to my work and apartment. I don't know what it is and I asked some of you for help on getting rid of it. So far, I\u2019ve gotten some good feedback. But, I decided to follow the advice given to me by u\/naxyom076.\n\nAs sad yet reasonable as Mr. Blank being a projection from my brain as a result of my crippling loneliness is, it feels too real to be a hallucination. I don't know why but I just KNOW he's real. I can't explain it but it just is. Plus, I've seen people occasionally bump into him by accident and give out an exasperated \u201csorry\u201d as they went back to walking to wherever they needed to be.\n\nHe never seemed to care of course. In fact, he didn't so much as glance back at them. He'd always just keep his eyes on me.\n\nAnyways, the suggestion to look directly into the thing's face was enough to put me at ease. But, the idea of actually TALKING to it was terrifying. But, the more I thought about it, it couldn't hurt to try and reason with it. I mean, in all the days I've seen it, Mr. Blank hasn't done anything to try and hurt me (not yet anyway). So, today I decided to give it a shot. Besides, if he DID want to hurt me, he'd have to put in a lot of effort to get to me. On every occasion I\u2019ve seen him, he's always outside or at a distance from me. The bastard would have to run a good couple yards to actually get to me and that\u2019d be hard to do so through a giant crowd of people. Plus, nothing\u2019s stopping me from just running away (despite my unhealthy lifestyle, I can be pretty fast with a good dose of adrenaline).\n\nAt about 12 am on a work day, I saw him sitting on a bench under a tree in the shade outside. I was in the office break room eating a giant bag of barbecue potato chips and saw him (as usual) out of the corner of my eye through the window adjacent to me. I remembered what noxy said and, to my chagrin, looked directly in his eyes and tried speaking to him with my thoughts. For a good five minutes I sat there staring at this thing. In my mind, I asked him various questions like \u201cWho are you?\u201d \u201cWhat do you want with me?\u201d \u201cAre you a ghost or alien or something?\u201d \u201cDo you want to hurt me?\u201d. And for every single question I asked, I got nothing but awkward silence. Mr. Blank just kept staring at me, with his little black beady eyes and thin moustache.\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d A voice in front of me asked.\n\nI eventually snapped out of the attempt at a psychic transaction and saw one of my co-workers, Daniel, in front of me. With that came the realization of how fucking stupid I looked while doing my little staring contest with Mr. Blank.\n\n\u201cMitch?\u201d Daniel said with concern, \u201cYou good, bro?\u201d\n\n\u201cY-yeah!\u201d I said, barely able to hide my shame, \u201c I'm fine.\u201d \n\n\u201cCool, thought you were having a Vietnam flashback or something.\u201d He said with a slight chuckle. I let out a little, fake laugh in response.\n\n\u201cYeah haha, yeah\u2026\u201d I said under my breath.\n\nAfter a couple seconds of awkward silence, Daniel walked over to the fridge to get his lunch. I wanted to crawl inside a hole at that very moment. How long was I just staring into nothingness? God, he must've thought I was nuts for a minute there.\n\nBefore I could wallow in my own embarrassment, I remembered another thing noxy said in their message. And, to my better judgment, I spoke up to Daniel once more.\n\n\u201cHey, Daniel. Before you um\u2026you see I need you to um\u2026 tell me something real quick.\u201d I said, practically tripping over my own words. As you can tell, I've never been good at starting (or maintaining) conversations.\n\n\u201cYeah, sure. What is it?\u201d He said.\n\n\u201cCan you look out the window for me?\u201d \n\n\u201cOk? Is there something cool out there?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you see that guy over there?\u201d I said, nervously.\n\n\u201cYeah I see a guy out there. And over there. And over there. There's a lot of guys outside, Mitch.\u201d Daniel said jokingly. \n\nDaniel has always been one to casually crack jokes in any given situation. A lot of people liked him for that. He\u2019s a light-hearted guy and a natural social butterfly. I both respect and envy him for it.\n\n\u201cNo no no, do you see that one guy outside. The one on the bench over there.\u201d I proceeded to point to Mr. Blank, still idly sitting on the bench under the tree. \u201cHim! Do you see him?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cUh yeah, I see him. That guy with the fancy suit on, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, him! Does he seem\u2026weird to you?\u201d I asked Daniel, with a sheepish tone.\n\n\u201cNot particularly, no. He just seems like a guy with a nice suit and killer mustache. I\u2019d have to go meet him after work if he's still there. Maybe he\u2019d give me some facial hair tips! Been trying to grow a stache for a while now!\u201d Daniel said with a hardy chuckle. \n\nIt was obvious he wasn't looking at the horrifying, misshapen being as I was.\n\n\u201cUh, you know what, nevermind. Sorry.\u201d I said as I proceeded to throw away the bag of chips I finished 5 minutes ago.\n\n\u201cUh, ok. See you around Mitch!\u201d He said as I shuffled away back to my cubicle.\n\nWell, at least I know this thing isn't psychic. But now I\u2019m worried one of my coworkers think I'm schizophrenic or something. Another thing to note is that other people seem to see Mr. Blank as a normal person and not a beady-eyed monster. But, on a side note, I'll only do my \u201cexperiments\u201d with Mr. Blank in private to avoid having awkward conversations explaining away my odd behavior. I'll try to keep you guys updated on further developments concerning Mr. Blank. But, for now, I'll be signing out. Hopefully not for the last time.\n\nUntil then, wish me luck.\n"

You first slept with my sofa and my sofa came back to life and I then had to kill it. I thought you were sincere with your apology but you clearly weren't. \n\nThen in the park pond you started sleeping with the water horny Rooney, and I couldn't believe it. How could sleep with the park pond and what was so attractive about the water in the park? Then I again I guess that's why they call you horny Rooney. Watery babies started to form as this was the creation of you sleeping with the water in the pond.

You made a hole in the brick and you slept with it. Horny Rooney how could you and those people lived in a hellish house ever since.

The mall wasn\u2019t the mall anymore. The hallways twisted like intestines, walls glistening with a sheen that pulsed like breathing flesh. Clocks hung from the ceiling, their faces liquefied, hands spinning backward, then forward, spiraling into impossible knots. My footsteps echoed, but they weren\u2019t mine alone.\n\nOthers joined\u2014too many, out of rhythm, some skittering like insects, others heavy as stone. I passed a storefront, its glass now a mirror, and saw not one reflection, but hundreds, crowding the surface. Their faces melted, mouths screamed silently, eyes blooming like flowers of black light.\n\nThe air tasted of ash and static, and the lights flickered in patterns that carved shapes into my vision\u2014spirals, fractals, things that shouldn\u2019t be seen. I stumbled into the food court, now a cavern of impossible geometry. Tables floated in mid-air, their legs twisting and curling like roots; chairs sprouted thorns of glass that shimmered in the dim light.\n\nIn the center stood another me, his uniform shredded, skin translucent, veins glowing like constellations. His head lolled unnaturally, neck bending at angles that made my stomach churn. He turned toward me, and his eyes were not voids but endless depths, swirling with stars that pulsed in time with my heartbeat. I froze, horrified and mesmerized, as it stared back at me\u2014*through*\u00a0me, as though it knew something I didn\u2019t.\n\n*\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d*\u00a0he said, his voice a chorus of mine, layered with tones that made my skull throb. His mouth split wider, teeth spiraling inward like the jaws of a black hole, pulling at the very air around us.\u00a0*\u201cThey\u2019re here. The ones who are you. The ones who aren\u2019t. Time\u2019s a tapestry\u2014and you\u2019re the tear.\u201d*\n\nI screamed, my voice unraveling into threads of light that floated upward. I ran, the mall folding in on itself, corridors looping into Mobius strips, doors opening to ceilings, to voids, to versions of the food court where the other mes waited. One grabbed me, his hand cold as deep space, fingers sinking into my arm like roots. \u2018Don\u2019t look at the stars,\u2019 he whispered, his face collapsing into a swirl of colors that burned my retinas like poison. I struggled, my arm locked in his grip, skin sizzling as the roots burrowed deeper. And then\u2014*a flash*\u2014I tore free, my skin peeling away in ribbons of light.\n\nSomehow, I reached the parking lot. The sky was a wound, stars pulsing like infected sores, constellations whispering my name in languages older than bone. My car sat where I left it, but its reflection in the asphalt split into a dozen shadows\u2014each with a different me inside. One clawed at the glass. Another grinned, teeth too many. One just wept, eyes static-blurred. I got in. The engine groaned like it knew the road was wrong. I drove, the road stretching into infinity, the horizon folding upward like a wave.\n\nI\u2019m home now, but home isn\u2019t right. The walls shimmer, the mirrors show faces that aren\u2019t mine but are. I checked my apartment\u2019s security camera feed. There I am, standing in the hallway, my body a silhouette of writhing shapes, my eyes leaking light. Behind me, the shadow is taller, its edges blooming into fractals that swallow the frame. I\u2019m inside, typing this, but I hear footsteps in the hall, too many, all mine.\n\nI don\u2019t know what I am anymore. But I know I\u2019m not alone."

    "selftext": "The story Im about to tell you, is very frightening and probably will make you feel some discomfort. Have fun.\n\nFor most people, Lunapark is an amazing pastime. A place where you make memories for your whole life, and a place you call \"magical\". I remember, that when I was a kid I've always wanted to go there. All of those TV shows about the \"great time in the Lunapark\" and all of the newspapers. But because my family was not the richest, I've never actually been to one. So ever since I was 8 years old, it was my dream to be in a Lunapark. I remember that there was a certain TV show called \"Phil's playground\". I used to watch it with my friends when we were younger. Especially with Josh. And Josh was my best friend. We grew up together and we always had each other's back. I remember how we always had our own jokes that only we could understood.\n\n**\"Phil's playground\"**\n\nI still remember how much I loved this show. Josh and I were addicted to it. There was somthing about that show that made me feel good. we watched every day at 5PM at josh's big house. we liked all the characters, but one in particular. Phil. Oh phil. He had a strange hair, small ears and a small bracelet on the right hand that said \"its playtime!\". But the weird thing about him was his blue eyes. They were huge. Not humen. Josh and I always found it weird that his eyes didn't match his face. But we were kids so we didn't really care. We loved phil's humor and admired him.\n\n**1987 April 12th**\n\nAt that time I was 15. I still watched \"Phils playground\" with Josh but much less. Most of the time that we would meet was to do math homework and studying for tests. At April 12th, Josh and I met at his big and fancy house to do some homework.\n\nI knocked on his door. But he did not open. I knocked again and yet no answer.\n\n\"Josh? Josh where are you?\" I said. Finally, after 5 minutes of me staring at his door, he opened his door.\n\nJosh welcomed me into his home and we started to do the homework. It took us around 30 minutes to finish it. I was going to go back home but then Josh said \"hey Dean... stay for a bit more\" I kind of didn't want to stay but I did anyway. \"Did you hear what happened to Phil's Playground? \" he said.\n\n\"What? no... what happened? \"\n\n\" It got shut down... for unkonwn reason.\"\n\n\"Oh\" I sighed. \"Do you know why?\"\n\n\"Nope... nobody does. Police isn't talking and the news have more important things to do.\"\n\nThen I had an idea.\n\n\"Why won't we go check what happened ourselves? I mean we are bored anyway...\" To this day, I dont know why those words came out of my mouth and why I didn't regret it. \"why not\" Josh said. \"But it's getting late we should do it tomorrow\". \n\nI took a flashlight, water and a hat. And here we were, riding on our bikes on our way to Phil's playground. I was never there and neither was Josh so we were kind of excited. It was far away, and I honestly couldn't wait to see for the first time The Phil's Playground.\n\n**Its playtime**\n\nI thought it would be difficult to get in... but the place was empty. There was nobody there. No workers, no police officers. Nothing. we started walking to the entry and left our bikes. We couldn't get through the gate because we had no tickets, but we managed to climb over the fence. \"Wow... this place is huge\" I said. And it really was. \"Not exactly the way I wanted to visit here\" Josh said. \n\nWe saw a stand of Phil's dolls. I thought it was cool,  especially because of the sound it made. \"Its playttime!\" with a cute voice. Phil's voice. Josh and I both took one and put it in our bags. We started to walk through the Lunapark and everything looked normal. Until we reached the Ferris wheel. It was still working... but there was no one to activate it. It was strange, we were alone. \"You think we aren't alone?\" Josh said. \"No... Maybe they  forgot to stop it\". It didn't make any sense but it wasn't too strange. Josh said he needs to go to the toilet, and so he did and I kept on staring at the feris wheel. I looked at every seat, but nobody was there. Except one thing. There was a weird strange blue liquid. It smelled. I didn't know why on earth would there be a blue liquid on a random seat but for some reason... I didn't really find it that weird again. \n\nBut then somthing happened. I heard laughter. I didn't know where it came from but I felt like it was behind but there was nothing there.\"Josh It's not funny\" I shouted. But he didn't answer. I went to the toilet to check if he was there. I opened the door and what I saw... gave me chills. It was this blue liquid. But not just that... where is Josh? I opened every toilet stall but what happened next... was terryfing. In the last toilet stall there was a body of a child. With a distorted face and huge eyes. I was in shock... I was scared like I had never been scared before. But what scared me the most was that Josh has disappeared. I closed the toilet stall and turned around. I looked in the mirror... and what I saw could not be real. The mirror had writing in blood on it... \"Its playtime!\" I fell to my knees in panic. My  heart dropped and I couldn't move. I didn't wanna play... I did not. I started shaking uncontrollably. Until I was brave enough to get up and punch that mirror as hard as I could. Punch after punch, until I broke it. My hand  started bleeding but I couldn't care less. \n\n5 minutes had passed and I calmed down. I started to breath more easilly and gain some control on my body. I left the toilet and closed the door. I leaned against the wall and started to think. \"Did Josh saw this and ran? Did he get away\" I could only hope he was okay. Josh was a strong guy, and he was way more brave then I was. He's definitely okay. I walked back to the Ferris wheel to see if Josh there. And surprisngly, he was. \"Josh!\" I shouted. I finally found him. \"We need to get out of here. now!\" I said. \"Why?\" he said. '' Im so glad you're okay!\". \"Why?\" he said. \"The toilets\" I said. But Josh didn't understand. He was confused... it was like he didn't notice what was in that toilet. Which I found impossible. \"What are you talking about? \"      Somthing was wrong with Josh...\"Did you play?\" He said. I didn't move. Josh turned around and went to the Ferris wheel. He got on it and sat down. He stared at me. And I stared back at him. He didn't blink, he didn't move, godamnit he didn't do nothing except staring at me. But then I noticed something... Every time I blinked, his eyes got bigger. Blink after blink, it didn't stop. This was not Josh, it was somthing else. His eyes got so big they were no longer looking human. It was terryfing... I wanted to turn around but I couldn't. For some reason, I wanted to keep staring at Josh's eyes. He stareted laughing, it wasnt his luagh, it was distorted. He started coughing blood, while his eyes kept getting bigger. Until the point that Josh's eyes were bigger then his face. Then, he just stopped. I heard a whisper. \"He wanted to play. What about you? Do you wanna play?\".\n\nI screamed. I know that whatever this thing is, made Josh go crazy. I had to turn around, I had to see it. What is the thing that killed Josh. I slowely turned around and started to breath heavier. And then I saw it. It was Phil. Just standing there. But instead of being a small and cute doll, it was tall, dark and furious. Instead of smiling, he was angry. But his eyes didn't change. It didn't move, he just stood there in front of me. I started running away from this thing. I ran as fast as I could, trying to save my life. I looked behind me... But it still didn't move. But I didn't care. I climbed over the fence, and got on my bike. \n\nI started to ride back home. I was glad I survived, but I was sad for Josh. He deserved better, he shouldn't have die like this. And it was all because of me. Poor Josh... He was a good friend. I made my way home and opened the door. It was 2AM so my parents were asleep. I went to my bedroon. and closed the door. I opened my bag to drink the water that I put in it. But then, I remembered, the **doll. It's in my damn bag.**"

    "selftext": "I'm on my way home after a hard day at school to see that my dad had set up the old computer in the kitchen area. I never really did like the old computer but I've had a fear of TV's and electronics like that since i was a kid so I didn't tell dad how i didn't like it there since i was 12 around then i wanted to feel grown up. My sister was home from college that week and we had just gotten Super Mario brothers for Wii. As me and my sister were playing co-op mode we herd a sort of raspy old man voice coming from what we thought was the living room closet. It was as if he was laughing at us. I only herd it at first and i asked my sister if she could hear it, she said she didn't hear anything and called me silly. I knew there was something going on but i didn't want to believe it. then i herd it again and it was much louder this time so i asked her again if she herd it she did that time and me and her were both freaked out so we turned of the game and went to bed. \n    That night i woke up at about 1 in the morning and i went to get some water in the kitchen and saw that the computer monitor was on. I felt a chill up my spine because the monitor is rarely ever on at all, the computer was only used for school or work purposes so i knew mom or dad wouldn't be on it that late. I went back to bed quickly as to not wake my parents up.\n      The next day i came home to find my sister curled upon the couch just staring at the TV i asked her what was wrong she said \"When I was playing Mario every time i died the voice kept mocking me telling me that i sucked, that i should just stop playing and get a life. So i called one of my friends and told them to quit playing around its not funny and it wasn't him. I've just been sitting here since.\" After she told me we herd it laughing again, and so we tried to call mom, she didn't answer.  The voice said \" you think you can get rid of me by calling your mother? That's not gonna happen.\" and it started laughing histareicly and me and my sister ran outside until mom got home. \n      Once mom got home we brought her into the living room so she could hear for herself she thought we were crazy and told us to stop being so immature and go t bed. \n       I couldn't sleep that night afraid that it would haunt my dreams, afraid that I'd have to go through another day of this torture, it was my worst night mare come to life, and i couldn't stop it from happening.   \n       My thoughts were right it went on for a good week and i couldn't go into the house with out my sister or mother coming home first I thought i was going mad, I thought that it was all inside my head and I couldn't make any sense of it. I went to counseling but it didn't help at all i could hardly get any sleep. Until one day the voice i could hear it but not from the usual spot i hear it. It was coming from the Kitchen from the old computer, it came from the speakers.\n       I had always thought the speakers were unplugged so i checked and they were. Once I checked all i could hear were screams, screams of bloody murder coming from the speakers i threw the speakers across the room. I couldn't move i felt trapped within the screams. after that day I find it hard to use any other computers that aren't laptops. My dad brought the old computer down stairs because it wouldn't work after what happened that day. It still scares me to this day to do laundry down stairs, i usually bring my old dog with me but i don't know what ill do when shes gone.\n         I still have nightmares about the voice, the screams, the threats,all the things that came from...The Speakers."

    "selftext": "10\/9\nToday, I met an angel. He was so courteous. So very kind. So\u2026 beautiful. I think I\u2019m in love. I met him when I was heading to the bus after school. We bumped into each other and I dropped my books. He knelt over and helped me, apologizing over and over again. His skin was shining and his hair was so bright. Darlene waited for me while we talked; he even gave me his number! 555-2765! I think he wants to meet again, oh I can\u2019t believe anyone that gorgeous would ever have any interest in little me. \n\n10\/12\nDarlene was being such a bitch today. Telling me that she didn\u2019t think I should be hanging around with Todd anymore. She\u2019s just jealous. He waits for me like a gentleman, right across the street from where the busses pick us up. I told her to grow up and stop acting like such a baby. She acts like it\u2019s such a big deal that I\u2019m seeing an older man. Jerk. \n\n10\/14\nTodd was just so perfect tonight. He was waiting outside of school again for me, and we went to see that detective movie that just came out. I don\u2019t even remember it. He held my hand during the whole film, and I could feel my heart racing, it was like we where running up and down stairs the entire time. I never would\u2019ve thought I\u2019d do something like this\u2026 but after the movie, when he was walking me home, we kissed\u2026 and I used my tongue! It was the hottest thing I\u2019ve ever done\u2026\n\n10\/19\nI hate my parents. They\u2019re hypocritical jerks! Just because he\u2019s so much older than Me. Mom is 6 years older than my Dad! Todd is only 9! Sure, the difference between 16 and 25 might sound like a big difference now, but think of when I\u2019m his age! 25 and 33 are nothing! They\u2019re just angry that I\u2019m happy.\n\n10\/20\nTodd wasn\u2019t happy when I told him how my parents reacted. But we\u2019ve figured it out. They can\u2019t boss me around. I can get a G.E.D. easy, and Todd already has a job, we\u2019d be able to set ourselves up fine WITHOUT their help. I don\u2019t need them anymore. I\u2019m an adult! We\u2019ve planned it already- tomorrow night, we leave for Minnesota, that\u2019s where Todd\u2019s from. I\u2019ve seen his car, it\u2019s a nice big van, complete with stereo! This is going to be incredible, and there\u2019s nothing mom or dad can do to stop me!\n\n10\/21\nTodd is so great. He\u2019s coming to pick me up tonight. They\u2019ll never even know what happened. Becky and Darlene promised not to tell anyone, Todd even told them he\u2019d do something bad if they did. Like he could ever, Todd wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly. I\u2019ve picked out what I want to bring with me already, it\u2019s all in a duffle waiting by my window. I can travel light. I\u2019m even leaving a note for those stupid parents of mine. This\u2019ll teach them to treat me like a child. \n"

The only unusual item they found was a copy of Sonic The Hedgehog\u2122 2006. My grandparents were shitty nintendo fanboys so they would never own a Sonic\u2122 game. I was curious why they had Sonic\u2122 06' so I took it while the police weren't looking. The police took my grandparents away for an autopsy, and I headed home to play the game. I booted it up and everything was normal except Sonic\u2122 was dead on the menu screen and everything was red. However, the spookiest difference was the title screen said Sonic\u2122 0666'. I booted up the save file and it was called \"you are too slow.\" Then I saw it was on Sonic's\u2122 story, but it wan't normal Sonic\u2122 it was Satan Sonic\u2122. I started playing Satan Sonic's\u2122 story when the song of healing and lavender town theme started playing simultaneously in reverse. Then was when I received a phone call from the police. They said that they had finished the autopsy and under both of my grandparents clothes \"ur 2 slo\" was written in the skin. Then I looked back at the screen and Big the Cat's\u2122 bloody body flew out of the TV. He had a ipod nano shoved up his nostril with headphones going into his ears. I put the headphones into my ear and the Sonic X\u2122 theme song was blasting its chorus on replay. I decided to ignore it and continue playing the game. Over the period of the rest game I had to dodge different Sonic\u2122 characters flying out of my TV. They all had different sonic themes playing in their ear. I got to the final boss fight as Amy's\u2122 body crashed against my wall. The boss was me and every time I hit it I hurt myself in real life. I decided to ignore it and continue playing the game. When I finished the boss fight I was almost dead, and Sonic's\u2122 face was coming closer and closer to the screen. A ipod nano slowly extended from my nostril and headphones centered into my ear. The Sonic Heroes\u2122 blasted into my ears at such intense volume that my ear drums burst. Then the head phones slipped down into my body and destroyed all my senses but sight.With only my sight remaining, Sonic's\u2122 face slowly filled my vision and I died in intense psychological and physical pain."

I have been cheating on her with 4 other women, and I also can't wait for those 4 other women to find out that I have been cheating on them aswell. The reason why I can't wait for my girlfriend and the other women to find out that I have been cheating on them is because they will realise that it is impossible for me to cheat. It truly is impossible for me to cheat even when I am cheating and I am going to love it when they all find out. \n\nI have been leaving my phone around the house in the hopes that my girlfriend will find it and see the messages. I have also been doing the same with the other 4 women I have been cheating with, but they never check my phone. When they all find out that I have been cheating on them, they will soon realise that I am not cheating and that it is impossible for me to cheat. I keeps leaving bread crumbs and clues about my cheating, but none of them are picking up the signal that I am doing something behind their backs. \n\nI admit it that when they miss clues of my cheating, I do become angry. Because it's making the whole journey much longer but I guess the journey is the point for all destinations. Then finally when I purposely left my phone on the bed and it was turned on, my girlfriend saw something on my phone which caused her distress. Finally it is going to start. My girlfriend and the other 4 women are going to find out that I have been cheating on them. I was secretly spying through the door as my girlfriend became upset. \n\nShe wasn't talking to me and acting all grumpy. I would pretend to not know what was wrong with her. She also put the numbers of the other girls onto her phone and she is clearly going to tell them that I have been cheating. They are going to plan to confront me. My girlfriend was now pretending to being all jolly and that she was going to take me out somewhere. \n\nShe looked confused when I wasn't bothered that she took me to a place where the other 4 women were also present to confront me about my cheating. They all shouted at me and poured drinks on me. All I said to them was \"I am not cheating it's impossible for me to cheat\" \n\nThey all looked confused. \n\nThen something came out of the shadows and it looked like a creature but it was actually human. It was all of the women that I had cheated on in the past, and they had all fused together to be one. Then my present girlfriend and the other 4 women started to fuze together with this thing and became one. \n\n\"See I told you all that I don't cheat, I only keep with one and you are all one\" "

Some times I think my mom and I are the only people in this house that's decent.\nWen I was in my room I listened to  my music and drew pitchers of people stabbing others and other gory things. I suddenly got Reilly tired then I checked the clock,it was12. I went to bed hoping tomorrow wold just be me on the earth. \n\"Hay  nickole\" I here'd a  voice calling me.\n\"Y-ya\"I said opening one eye.\n\"I have to go to Florida for work I want to say good bay.\" My mom whispered.

    "selftext": "      My blood shot eyes were frozen in place as it emerged from the shadows of the hallway. I wanted to say something to it, to ask what it was and what it was doing in my house but I knew deep inside that even if I could speak, I wouldn\u2019t get an answer. Time slowed, I could see its absent face with all the contours of an ordinary face but with no physical presence. Skin was stretched from the brink of his forehead beyond the visible descent past the arch of his chin. Surrounding the borders of his face were scars, these scars were strangely symmetrical and following the line to the side of his head almost perfectly; there were a few scars that were deeper than all the rest. This creature had such a grotesque body structure, its legs were far taller than its torso and it was bent forward with its back pressed against the ceiling. It makes me nauseous to behold how truly stomach churning his clothes really were, his excuse for a shirt was once white but now it was almost completely soaked in blood and where there wasn\u2019t blood there were brown, green and black stains I can guess that the brown and green stains are where it retched from either pain, stress, nausea or a combination of all three; I can only guess what the black stains could be. Time was running out and the creature was still advancing, I only have one option: I have to get the gun from my bedside table but I don\u2019t know exactly where it is on the table. If I misjudge this the creature will be able to pounce and it will surely be the end of me. The creature took its first step into the room and in an instant I reacted. The creature and I moved together, I leapt towards the table and grabbed the gun and spinning around I aimed and fired. I\u2019m not sure what happened after that, the room looks strange. I woke up to find myself crumpled against the side of my bed, the walls and ceiling was dripping black ooze. I turned my gaze towards the window and outside looked sombrely overcast. I ran towards the door and tried the handle\u2026 locked. I began to panic. I took a step backwards and almost tripped on my gun that lay exposed on the wooden floor. The gun looked attractive there and I felt beguiled as I all too easily picked it up and pointed the barrel at my temple\u2026 No. I swung around and fired three times into the handle then with a powerful kick the handle broke off and the door flew open. I can\u2019t say I was surprised at what I saw. Thousands upon thousands of doors were placed side by side and row by row. Hundreds of those\u2026 creatures wandered from door to door dragging the unconscious heaps from each room towards a corridor where an agglomeration of screams, blinding lights and a soul crushing chill sure to dampen even the highest of spirits. Lost in my trance I failed to see one of the creatures notice me. This creature was smaller than the one I encountered but by no means any less abhorred. The centre of its spine was visible nearly a foot above its back, its right elbow was inverted and had its calf imbedded through its left patella. The shock of seeing this creature gave it its only advantage. It charged then leapt on top of me, closer I could see the patch that covered the face of the last creature was ripped open on this one. I couldn\u2019t remember what I saw behind the layer of skin but that doesn\u2019t matter now. I must\u2019ve passed out as I have awakened on a surgeons operating table strapped down and the black ooze from earlier was everywhere. I heard a muffled voice coming from the other side of the pitch black room. Again, I tried to speak but the result was the same as before. I heard the voice again but louder as if he was right next to me but I still couldn\u2019t make out the words. After the voice stopped I was freed from my bounds and my immediate action was to rub my eyes and attempt to make my way towards a light source but as rubbed my eyes it felt as if I was rubbing my chest. I wanted to cry but couldn\u2019t\u2026 Do you know what that feels like? To have one\u2019s emotions trapped inside your soul with no way of escape. It killed me. I wanted to breathe and feel the air I so rashly neglected. I remember thinking the first time I encountered one of those creatures I thought it was the end but now I realise, it\u2019s only the beginning."

    "selftext": "Last friday a dead couple was found in thier house. The bodies belonged to the twenty two- yars old Sara and her boyfriend, the twenty five- years old Francis. The police believes it's the work of \"The love killer\", a serial killer who killed eight people last valentine's day and kept on hunting for couples since then. \n\nThe bodies were hound by Mark, a colleague of Francis who became worried after his friend didn't show up on work after monday.\nHere is the story of Mark:\n\n'It was friday afternoon and Francis still didn't picked up the phone so I decided to go visit his house. I rang the doorbell but as espected no one opened the door for me, after waiting for some time I decided to enter the house with a spare key that I got from Francis after he moved in, in case he forgo his key some day. When I opened the door a strong smell of what felt like death hit me and I almost had to vomit, I wanted to call the police because of the kilings which been going on lately, but curiosity got the best of me, I guess. So I decidet to search the house and hopefully find out what was going on, oh I wish I didn'd have done that. The house seemed fine. It's when I got to the bedroom, or the crime scene how you call it, that's when I finaly vomited, ran out the house and called the police.\"\n\nThe two bodies were found lying on thier bed, they were both paralyzed with some kind of Neuromuscular paralysing- drug injected through thiers necks. The killer then cut open Francises shirt and cut his chest open with what the police thinks was a scalple. The killer then removed the liver, left lung, right kidney, the stomach and finaly also the hart whitch he then placed in Saras mouth, Sara drowned in the blood coming from the hart. The bodies were, due to the warm weather, in thier mid-decomposting stage and, just like by the previous killings a broken hart painted with blood on the wall above the bodies.\n\n\n                                 As A Reminder\n\nThe security council highly reccomends to all loving couples to purchase strong safety locks and make sure to lock all doors and windows before sleep. Also wach out if you walk alone in the dark.\n\nThe police is still looking for \"The love killer\", he seems to be around 1,90m long with shoulder long brown hair and a short beard. According to the last security footage he possibly weares:      \n-A black cap\n-A long, grey jacket\n-Red pants\n-Black shoes\n-Brown gloves\n\nFor more information visit our site:\n https\/\/www.crime-UK.com\/thelovekiller"

A special episode of Spongebob was\nabout to start and I was very excited about it because Spongebob is my favorite cartoon.\nThe episode started and the intro was corrupted like jumbles of color. Then there was text\nfor about 1 minute. It said \u201cIf you don\u2019t want bad luck until you\u2019re 70 you should turn this off now.\nThen another text appeared \u2013 \u201cYour choice\u201d.\nThe episode started and I saw Spongebob facing the corner of his home. The camera slowly panned to Spongebob\nthen Spongebob looked at the camere with blood shot eyes. Then there was Patrick\u2019s house for about a minute.\nThen there was Patrick watching tv and Spongebob behind him holding a knife. He cut Patrick\u2019s head off and ate his\nbody. The next shot showed Squidward\u2019s house for about a minute. Squidward was sleeping and Spongebob was holding a\npack of scissors. Then he cut a whole in Squidward\u2019s body and ripped out his intestine. The Spongebob pulled a gun and\nshot himself. The episode ends with Bikini Bottom on fire and a sign saying \u201cSpongebob\u2019s Lost Town\u201d.\nThen the tv turns black and returns to an episode of Rick And Morty as if nothing happened.\n\nAfter that I started getting bad luck.\n\nOriginal author: BubuSquid\nhttp:\/\/www.creepypasta.org\/pending\/spongebobs-cursed-episode"

    "selftext": "One day a man in white walks in my hall. The man in white walks towards my friend that I am next to.\n\nI should give you some description of the man. He is wearing a white coat\n, white jeans, white boots and a white Guy Fawkes mask.\n\nHe comes up to him and asks in a low heavy voice, \"Tell me child what do find most important in the your life\".\n\"Family I guess\", my friend replied.\n\nTwo weeks later my friend calls me. His voice is shaky as he says \"S-Sam they're dead. They're all dead, and he's here; Sam he's here. h-help me!\".\n\nI quickly ran to my friend's home, which was a good fifteen minutes. As I approached the end of my friend's street, I stopped to catch my breath. I saw the flicker of red and blue on the side of the houses. As I rounded the corner, I saw three body bags come out from the home. Then, I noticed my friend in a police car and next to him was a man in Red.\n\nA few months pass, my friend came back with an aid escorting him to make sure he doesn't have another episode. We sat down in my living room.\n\n\"Uh, hi dude. Be-be-been a wha-wha-while.\" he stuttered. \n\"Yeah.\" I said in a much lower voice than before.\n\"He's watching us.\" he whispered.\n\"Hello my children.\" said the man in white. Except he wasn't in white or red for that matter. His clothes were now a light stain of pink with his mask worn out from something.\n\nHe places his hand on my shoulder and in the same low voice says \"Help me. I'm dying. Just answer my question\" he says.\nMy friend punches the man in the shoulder. \"Shut up. Sam don't listen to him.\" he said as he started to tear up.\n\nThe man in pink fell to his now skinny legs.\n\"Just let him rot like a apple.\" my friend said in an angry voice\n\nThe man in pink stood up and walked out the door.\nI snap out of it and ask him what the hell is going on.\n\nHe explained to me that the man seems to thrive on making peoples lives a living hell. He kills every thing that my friend calls family. My friend decided that he's going to leave the state a while until it starves to death to make sure he can't kill anyone.\n\nI paused and then asked, \"Then, why am I still alive?\"\n\"He's weaker now than he was. I've managed to contain him.\" he replied. \n\nWith that, he stood up and opened the door. The aid and the man in pink entered the living room. The aid doesn't seem to notice the man in pink at all. Then they left my living room and left the state.\n\nThe END..."

    "selftext": "It was September, me and my brother were at Disneyland for the first time in our lives, of course being boys we wanted to ride space mountain first. If any of you have been to Disneyland in the fall you'd know that space mountain turns into ghost galaxy. A surprisingly scary ride for Disney. Of course it was our first time so we didn't know until we got to the front of the attraction. I at the time was a big fan of horror movies so I was excited to see the cool tricks the ride was going to play on us, although nobody expected what happened that day. As we stood  in line on the roof we stared anxiously at the entrance to indoor section of the ride. Above the entrance the words \"space mountain\" were illuminated in bright red. As I stared at the sign I got an uneasy feeling, but I shrugged it off and  walked forward. We walked inside into the long hallways. As I walked inside I noticed red lettering on the wall, to small to notice if you weren't paying attention. It said \"Think on your sins\" in very sloppy hand writing almost as if it had been written hastily. I look behind me and notice a cute girl about my age. I smiled and walked forward, as we boarded our \"ships\" I noticed she was sitting behind me and my brother. What happened next makes me to this day regret ever stepping in to that ride. I turn around and smile at the girl, she smiles back pushing her blonde hair out of her blue eyes. Then the ride begins. We move forward a few feet and stop. The lady on the platform asks us to push up on our lap bar, and we do. We move forward once again, into something we never expected. We began our incline up the first hill, everything was fine until we went into the dark room. A dark raspy voice went on the speaker. \"THINK ON YOUR SINS\" it repeated it self over and over until we got into the portal. The portal opened and the ghost appeared, then everything on the ride stopped. The ghost stopped moving,then it started glitching and a brief frame of a decapitated head flashed. The hair was blonde and the head had blue eyes, opened wide and staring. \"Think on your- s- s- sins.\" More flashes of mutilated bloody corpses \"Think on your sins\" The room went dark, so dark in fact I could barely see my hands. A shrill scream  of a girl echoed through the chamber.The ride went on. Every time there should've been a ghost, a body of some poor soul popped up.  At the end of the ride where there should have been one final jump scare there was an image that said \"THINK ON YOUR SINS\" and in the background a bloody decapitated head sat on a table, of a blonde haired , blue eyed girl. I looked behind me, and there was no one there. We got off the ride and everyone  who was on the cart was screaming and crying. It took the police a while to piece it together. It supposedly was an act of extremism, that someone had managed to break in and change the program. As soon as I got out of the ride I ran to the screens where the pictures were displayed. I quickly found my picture,and the was no one in the seat behind me. Was I the only one who saw her? Was she just a spirit of that girl, trying to warn us? The rest of that day was a blur. I remember collapsing to my hands and knees and vomiting. My brother had ran off to my parents, because he still lived with them. The last thing I remembered before I blacked out was the number of the photo: 435763 or HELP ME."

    "selftext": "**[THE WHITEHEAD SNIPPETS:\nTeenage Ass Rammers](http:\/\/albruno3.blogspot.com\/2015\/02\/the-whitehead-snippets-teenage-ass_22.html)\nby\nAl Bruno III**\n\n*From a reel to reel tape found in the basement of St. Elizabeth\u2019s church\u2026*\n\n+\n\nI never told anyone the whole story but I'll tell you because confession is a sacrament in your church and you guys can\u2019t tell anyone what you hear. It doesn\u2019t even matter if I\u2019m part of your congregation or not. I just need to tell someone. Secrets can make you lonely sometimes.\n\nThe night it happened it was me and Jim and Colleen and Harry. We were driving back from Vermont, Jim had a car and Harry knew a store that would sell beers to teenagers. It was in the middle of nowhere and they didn't ask for ID or anything. Since we had all been drinking Jim was taking the back roads, it was all farms and woods and no cops. No traffic at all most nights.\n\nThe moon was out and it was bright red. I was in the backseat with Harry, I had my feet out the window and my head was in his lap. Not in a disgusting way, I was just resting it there watching the moon chase us. Jim and Colleen were arguing about what CD they were going to play next. They wanted to get married after graduation but everyone thought their taste in music would break them up by the prom. Grindcore and hip hop just don't mix. \n\nI think that's why Harry asked me out, he figured that since I was best friends with Colleen that I would automatically do the stuff she did. Don\u2019t get the wrong idea, I\u2019m saving myself for marriage but I\u2019m no prude either. There are other ways to keep your sweetheart happy- if you know what I mean.\n\nOh God. Did I really say that? I must sound so stupid and gross but it\u2019s kind of part of the story. I want you to know Colleen was a good girl, that she died in a clean state.\n\nWe were going around a blind turn when we hit something. It was something alive. No, I didn't see exactly how it happened because of the way I was lying down  but I heard everything. There was this loud noise, it wasn't a horn honking or brakes squealing, it was like a shout or a laugh. Everyone started to scream. The car skidded and started to tip over but then it didn't. I fell forward and Harry fell on me. My ankle hit the corner of the window I had my foot out of. Then there was the sound of a crash but it wasn't the way you'd think a car accident would sound. It was way quieter. Or maybe the sound of my ankle breaking was just way louder to me.\n\nEverything stopped. The car's engine hissed and went out. One headlight was still on.  Then everyone started yelling. I was freaking out from the pain. Harry was freaking out from the way my foot was all flopped over to the side. Jim was freaking out over his car. And Colleen was freaking out because Jim hadn\u2019t been looking where he was going.\n\nIt hurt to move but I had to climb off of Harry and I wanted to be sitting up, I wanted to see what was going on. There wasn't much to see though, the windshield was like a spiderweb.\n\nFirst Colleen got out of the car, then Harry, then Jim. I wasn't going anywhere. They all stood there in front of the car looking at whatever it was. I yelled, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cA mule!\u201d Harry called back, \u201cWe hit a mule!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's a donkey.\u201d Colleen said. \n\n\u201cA mule is a donkey!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat the Hell does that matter?\u201d Jim sounded like he was ready to cry, \u201cLook what it did to my car!\u201d\n\nHarry said, \u201cI think it's dead.\u201d\n\nThen they all started yelling at each other again. I tried to call 911 but my phone had no power. I told Harry to make the call but Jim freaked, he didn\u2019t want to get in trouble.  Colleen tried to tell him it was too late to worry about that.\n\nFour men walked out of the tall cornfield on the one side of the road. I figured they\u2019d be rednecks but when one of them spoke he had this really weird accents. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d he said.\n\nThe four men walked past Colleen and Harry and Jim and stood in front of the car. I couldn\u2019t see them clearly because of how the windshield was cracked but I think they were wearing really tall hats. They started talking fast, most of it didn\u2019t make much sense except that they said the word \u2018Ball\u2019 a lot.\n\nThere was something about the way they were acting that made me scrunch down in the back seat and stay quiet. I heard Colleen ask \u201cWas it your mule?\u201d\n\nThen they shot her. Boom! I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t see it happen. I think I would have gone really crazy instead of just sort of crazy. Harry tried to run and they shot him in the back three times. Boom! Boom! Boom! Jim was the last one left, he said \u201cBut it was an accident.\u201d\n\nBoom!\n\nI didn\u2019t think I was crying, I thought I was being quiet but one of the men in the tall hats noticed me and dragged me out of the car by my hair. All I wanted to do was run away but you can\u2019t run with a broken foot and anyway they had guns didn\u2019t they?\n\nThe guy with the tallest hat kept picking me up and throwing me back down. He called me names and said we\u2019d ruined everything, that we should never have been out here on this road. Everything hurt. All of them stood around me in a circle. I knew for sure they were gonna stomp me to death or worse and there wasn\u2019t anything I could do about it. I remember that I thought to myself that it would seem really brave to them if I didn\u2019t try to crawl away.\n\nThat was when someone laughed. It wasn\u2019t any of the men in the tall hats, they were too mad, and all my friends were dead. It was someone else. \n\nThe laugh was loud and weird, it made me think of fireworks and petting zoos and after a few seconds it turned into a voice, *\u201cOh ye of little faith.\u201d*\n\nI could only see by the one headlight that was left but I know what I saw. The mule stood up. It stood all the way up going from four legs to two. It went from being an animal to a man, a mule-man that was way too tall and had a stretched out head. \n\nThe men in the tall hats dropped to their knees and started praying but the mule-man wasn\u2019t having any of it. He stomped them to death with his big mule hooves and they never even tried to run away. Maybe they thought they were being brave too.\n\nAfter that I\u2019m not sure what happened next. I remember being picked up and carried away. I remember thinking I was so far from the ground that I might be able to touch the moon.\n\nNext thing I knew I was waking up in a hospital bed. My whole family was there, it was just like the movies when the main character lives even though they\u2019re not supposed to. There were a lot of questions but I told everyone I didn\u2019t remember anything.\n\nI\u2019ll always remember the words I heard that night. Especially all the times I thought they said \u2018Ball\u2019.\n\nBut now I think they were saying \u2018Baal\u2019. B-A-A-L not B-A-L-L. Big difference, I read online that Baal is some kind of a devil. In some of the drawings he has a head kind of like a mule \n\nWe didn\u2019t hit an animal. I think maybe it hit us. It picked us out and the men in the tall hats were jealous.\n\nI think it has big plans for me.\n\nNo. It\u2019s not like that at all. I\u2019m not pregnant with some devil-baby.\n\nAt least not yet.\n\nI told you, I\u2019m saving myself for marriage."

    "selftext": "So I'm a fan of the old Spongebob Squarepants episodes. You know, the ones from 1999 to about 2003? I think the show should've walked into the sunset after the movie released in 2004. Nickelodeon only keeps the sponge around so they still have something to draw viewers in, because we all know they're not exactly the channel used to be. That's my rant for the day. Let me get to what I actually came here to tell you. It just may change the way you think.\n \n  Some time in September I was sick with the common cold. One night, I just got done playing some GTA V and was ready to try to fall asleep, something I was unable to accomplish for the past couple of nights. I turned off the console and put the channel on Nicktoons Network, Nickelodeon's second-rate channel. After Jimmy Neutron had ended, the screen said \"Spongebob Squarepants! New Episode Up Next!\" in bright, garish colors. \"What the hell was a new episode doing on Nick's sub-par network where tasteless shows come to die?\" I thought to myself as I noticed the graphic. So the episode was about to start, And I wanted to find out just what the hell was going on. \n\n  The intro was a claymation sequence like the one for Truth or Square. I laughed at that episode because of SpongeBob and Sandy getting married. The screen showed the title card, \"The Meaning of Life\" in bright,disturbingly garish colors. The quality was top-notch. I know what you're thinking. \"Lost episodes are always in bad quality!\" Well this was different. \n\n  It started with SpongeBob walking over to Patrick's house. As Spongebob opened the rock, Patrick is seen crying, so bad that his eyes are bloodshot. Spongebob asks what the matter is, and Patrick just says \"Spongebob, what is the meaning of life?\" Spongebob just answers with \"Well, I learned it from our Lord and savior! I'll let you meet him if you want.\" \"Can I please?\" Patrick said. \"Sure thing buddy!\" I should have noted that the voices of the two sounded off-kilter, like someone was impersonating the original voices. This was with all of the other characters as well.\n  \nIt then did the bubble screen transition to Sandy's Treedome. Spongebob and Patrick were standing with Bibles in their hands waiting for Sandy to answer. I never thought of Spongebob as a religious cartoon. I got a weird feeling seeing the Bibles. I never trusted religion, so maybe it was that. Maybe not. \"Evil\" is the best word that describes how I felt. I never thought religion was evil, just a tad whacky. \n\n  After Sandy opened the door, Spongebob said \"Hello Sandy! Would you like to discover the meaning of life by finding the Lord?\" Sandy, puzzled, responded with \"Spongebob, I can find the meaning of life through science. I don't need your Bible.\" I agreed with Sandy on that one. Spongebob then grew angry. They then assaulted Sandy with typical violence. This was even weirder though. There was blood around her unconscious body. Not \"hyper-realistic\" like you were expecting. It was cartoonish blood, but downright disturbing nonetheless. Spongebob, in a serious tone of voice, says \" Her Pride will be her downfall.\"\n  \n The screen then did the transition again to Mr. Krabs' house. It was the same routine as the first. Spongebob and Pat preaching, Mr. Krabs ironically saying \"I already a religious feller me boy\", and him being taken down by Spongebob's speed and Patrick's strength. If the gore wasn't there along with the creepy religious undertones, I probably would've laughed at Spongebob and Patrick assaulting the poor crustacean. As stated by the sponge, Mr. Krabs' sin... was Greed.\n\n  It then showed a montage of the routine happening to Plankton, Gary, and finally Squidward. The words \"Envy, Gluttony, Wrath\" flashed on the screen for each scene, respectively. It then cut to the final scene. In the middle of Spongebob's living room on the floor were Sandy, Mr. Krabs, Plankton, Gary, and Squidward tied up laying on the floor in a pentagram formation. Spongebob have a speech about how the great angel Lucifer is the real true martyr. That evil feeling I got was correct. They were worshipping a whole different God, you see. He then went on saying that Squidward was always the one he hated the most. He was implying that thus whole time Squidward was the tragic hero of the series as he sinned and was banished to the sea to eradicate the demonic presence, which turned out to be Spongebob. Spongebob then ordered Pat to \"Slay the sinners to set them free of their burden.\" Patrick then grabbed a kitchen knife and slit the throats of everyone except for Mr. Krabs, who pleaded for his life.\n\n  \"Spongeboy, why do this?\" Krabs cried. \"I gave you a place to work and make money! Sandy loved you, Gary was just an animal, but Plankton used you and Squidward hated yer. It didn't mean they had to die!\" Spongebob then shoots Patrick in the back of the head. \"You were all sinners, so you had to either confess or meet him. I'm gonna assume \"him\" was the devil. Just a hunch. But as Spongebob raised the gun to shoot Mr. Krabs, two cops busted the door down and aimed at Spongebob. Spongebob turned and aimed at the cops and was promptly shot dead. The cops untied Krabs and told him everything was alright and that \"Everyone will know what that little yellow bastard did.\" Mr. Krabs kept repeating thank you over and over. They also asked Krabs to come back to the precinct with them to write a report.\n\n  Two weeks later Pearl was getting a ride home after hanging out with her friends. As she entered, her sanity was put into question. On the floor, surrounded by a pool of blood and a pistol, was what remained of her father. His head was opened by the gunshot with the inside being visible. Next to his body lay a note. \"GREED. A powerful motivation. Wouldn't you agree? Now they all join me in peace and harmony. See you soon.\" It was signed with \"Yours Truly, True God.\" Mr. Krabs never shot himself. Maybe he did, but not by his own merit. He did this. The devil did this. And he was going after his daughter next. The final scene showed Pearl on her knees crying over the corpse of her father. The screen then showed the Bible verse Revelation 21:6. I knew the verse because I'm addicted to Fallout 3. At the bottom it said the name \"Daniel Montoy\".\n\n  Obviously after watching something like that, I didn't get any sleep. So I decided to do a little bit of investigating into who this was and why he made such a demented cartoon. Luckily, I found a few things.\n\n  After looking the name up, I found a little background to Spongebob in the process. Daniel Montoy was a student studying marine biology with Stephen Hillenburg. They both had an idea for a cartoon involving sea creatures that acted like humans. Montoy was a little unstable. He kept wanting to give the characters sociopathic qualities that Hillenburg didn't agree with. He wanted the show darker with more adult themes while Hillenburg was aiming for a children's cartoon. Their opinions eventually clashed ending in an unprovoked attack which left Hillenburg in critical condition and Montoy getting sent to a mental institution. He remained there from 1994 to August of 2013. He used stock footage of Spongebob scenes to create that demented episode I had seen. He wanted to get revenge. On the man who in his eyes threw him under the bus all those years ago. And he was angry. So there you have it. No demons. No haunted cartoons. No lost episodes. Just a guy with daddy issues seeking revenge. Was it creepy? He'll yes. It worked. I still wanna know how he got control of a broadcast tower to air his creation to the world. That remains a mystery.\n\n  Is there something we can learn from this? I would assume so. Just be careful who you piss off."

    "selftext": "You should never hit a female like ever and no matter what they do violence is never the answer. A couple of weeks ago a creature from the forest invaded my home and it was a female creature. Even though it wasn't human it was still female and so I didn't shoot it or do anything violent towards it. My wife begged me to shoot it and I was disgusted that my wife would allow me, a man, to hit a female even though it wasn't human. My wife went down to confront it and the creature started to attack my wife, I was conflicted as to what I should have done. \n\nI decided to not do anything towards the female creature as hitting females is just wrong. My two children were terrified and I told them that everything will be fine and that the reason I wasn't doing anything was because of my strong beliefs of never hitting anything female. If the creature was male it would have been dead by now but unfortunately it was the wrong gender. I even stood firmly and watched the creature eat my son and I tried pleading with it to not eat my son but it did. Now it was just me and my daughter and I was so scared for the both of us. \n\nMy daughter begged me to do something but I replied back to her saying how she would feel if someone had hit her if she was going through hard times. My daughter shouted back at me saying that this creature was not human and so it didn't matter that it was female. I begged to differ with her that even if this female is another race of an unknown species, it is still female and I don't hit females like ever. My daughter was becoming so anxious that she couldn't breath and I tried my best to calm her. \n\nThe creature took her eventually and now it's just me and it. I will not fight back even though I know that it's going to eat me."

    "selftext": "I don\u2019t care if you believe me or not about this story, but it is 100% true.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened: I was binging the new Netflix original series \u201cThe Epic Tales Of Captain Underpants\u201d.(It\u2019s actually really good.) It was 2 in the morning and I was on the last episode when all of a sudden my laptop showed an error for the internet connection. I quickly got up and messed with the modem a bit, got another tub of vanilla ice cream then proceeded to sit back down.\n\nWhen I opened up my laptop it seemed to be working again. I finished the last episode then tried to find a new animated series. I found the Netflix original series \u201cHome:Adventures With Tip & Oh.\u201d I turned it on and started watching. Eventually that night I got to the newest season but when I tried to start it instead of getting the usual Netflix Original and Dreamworks logo I got just a screen of a black & white zoomed in picture of Tip with text saying: \u201cI see you at your computer.\u201d\n\nI was confused and scared. I skipped forward to the next episode thinking it might be different. It was the same thing. I skipped to the last episode of the season. This time it first played a Dreamworks logo with the Dreamworks mascot hanging from a noose. Instead of reading \u201cDreamworks\u201d it read: \u201cHe was hung. Not by himself but by you.\u201d\n\nNow this was really scaring me. The same image and text from the previous episodes appeared but now with eerily cheery music in the background. I exited the episode only to see on the home screen that everything on my list was now horror movies. I decided to turn off my laptop and just watch tv. But instead of finding a channel when I turned on the tv I found a error for my internet again. I went to modem but found I t had been smashed in half with a bloody handprint on the remains. I screamed. In blood on the wall it said: \u201cNo escaping your family.\u201d \n\nI went back to the couch only to find a headless Captain Underpants plush where I was previously sitting. I ran to the phone and dialed 911. Instead of getting the 911 dispatcher I got a message from Tip saying: \u201cI see you at your phone.\u201d Then hung up. I quickly ran to the bathroom to splash water on my face to help me calm down. When I looked up at the mirror when I was done I saw that the mirror was broken and found another blood message saying: \u201cI\u2019m taking the spotlight now.\u201d I then ran to the couch, went under my blanket and forced myself to sleep. \n\nThe next morning I woke up with a serious migraine. When I fully woke up I realized the house was on fire. I screamed then ran out of the house. Right on my front porch was a package addressed to me. I opened it. Inside was a Tip plush and a note. The note said: \u201cLook behind you.\u201d I quickly looked behind me. I saw nothing. Then I looked back at my hands. The package and note were gone but the plush wasn\u2019t. I quickly threw the Tip plush into the burning flames but when it started burning it let out a bloodcurdling scream of agony and pain. I ran away from the house. Luckily when all of this stuff went down my parents were still on their business trip. When they got back I lied about what caused the fire and just said that a tree fell down on the house and started the fire by also falling down on electrical wires then sparked and that caused it.\n\nWe moved into a new house a month later. When I finally got back to school I told my best friend everything. Obviously he didn\u2019t believe me. He said that if I show him proof then he would believe me. After school that day I walked home to find a package on the doorstep. My parents weren\u2019t home at that time. I opened the package on my bed. In it was a disc. On the disc it read: \u201cYour proof\u201d. I was a little nervous to bring that to school but I showed him it and he seemed impressed.\n\nHe came home with me and so we put it in the DVD player. It started playing the eerily cheery tune and picture with text. My friend seemed mesmerized. I looked up at the screen again I saw my friend hanging right next to the Dreamworks mascot. I looked back beside me. Instead of my friend being there it was Tip. Ever since that day I\u2019ve been forced to pretend nothing happened as no one else was able to see that my friend was replaced. \n\nShe told me that I can tell no one of what happened to me so now that I have written this I will surely be hung. And now that you\u2019ve read this, she\u2019s coming after you. After all, she sees you at everything you do."

Figuring it was just the coffee doing its job, I ran to the restroom, expecting the usual quick visit.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t leave.\n\nMinutes turned to hours, hours to days. Every time I tried to stand up, the pressure would return, forcing me back down onto the toilet. At first, I thought it was some weird stomach bug, something that would pass. I tried doctors, medications, everything. But nothing helped.\n\nDays turned to weeks. My body didn\u2019t wither, didn\u2019t weaken\u2014I just kept\u2026 pooping. My friends tried to help, but they soon drifted away. Work fired me, of course, but I never left the house to care. I was bound to this porcelain throne.\n\nYears passed, and my life outside the bathroom faded away. The walls of the room began to change, growing darker, the tiles warping, shifting. It felt like something was watching me, feeding off my endless torment.\n\nI tried to remember the taste of solid food, the feeling of fresh air, but the memories slipped away, replaced by the unrelenting smell of waste.\n\nNow, 20 years have passed. My reflection in the mirror looks like a stranger\u2014gaunt, hollow eyes staring back. The bathroom feels smaller now, the door further away each day.\n\nI can\u2019t stop.

    "selftext": "Infinite cum. You sit on the toilet to jack off, but you begin to cum uncontrollably. After ten spurts you start to worry. Your hand is sticky and it reeks of semen. You desperately shove your dick into a wad of toilet paper, but that only makes your balls hurt. The cum accelerates. It\u2019s been three minutes. You can\u2019t stop cumming. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of baby fluid. You try to cum into the shower drain but it builds up too fast. You try the toilet. The cum is too thick to be flushed. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cum from escaping. The air grows hot and humid from the cum. The cum accelerates. You slip and fall in your own sperm. The cum is now six inches deep, almost as long as your still-erect semen hose. Sprawled on your back, you begin to cum all over the ceiling. Globs of the sticky white fluid begin to fall like raindrops, giving you a facial with your own cum. The cum accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cum begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a bukkake themed slip-and-slide. Still on your knees, the cum is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of man juice reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with cum instead of molasses. The cum accelerates. It\u2019s been two hours. Your children and wife scream in terror as their bodies are engulfed by the snow-white sludge. Your youngest child goes under, with viscous bubbles and muffled cries rising from the goop. You plead to God to end your suffering. The cum accelerates. You squeeze your dick to stop the cum, but it begins to leak out of your asshole instead. You let go. The force of the cum tears your urethra open, leaving only a gaping hole in your crotch that spews semen. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the cum. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird\u2019s eye view you see your house is completely white. Your neighbor calls the cops. The cum accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray loads of cum hit them in the eyes, blinding them. The cum accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. Hundreds of bullets pierce your body at once, yet you stay conscious. Your testicles have now grown into a substitute brain. The cum accelerates. It has been two days. With your body now destroyed, the cum begins to spray in all directions. You break the sound barrier. The government deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cum sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the earth. You feel your gonads start to burn up as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new white paint job as you fly past. Physicists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The cum accelerates. The cum begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of semen. Astronomers begin calling you the \u201cCummet.\u201d You are stuck in space forever, stripped of your body and senses, forced to endure an eternity of cumshots. Eventually, you stop thinking.\n\nThe cum accelerates. You're now fully enveloped in its horrifying embrace, floating aimlessly in the abyss of space. Your senses are dulled; all that exists is the endless pulse of cum, a monstrous heartbeat echoing in the vacuum. Time becomes a meaningless concept, as does space. There is only cum and you. The cum accelerates. Astronomers on Earth track your cum trail, the 'cummet,' with a mix of horror and fascination. The cum begins to exert its own gravitational pull, capturing small bits of space debris, adding to the growing monstrosity. The cum accelerates. As Earth reels under the impending doom, an unlikely alliance forms between world leaders and the users of r KerbalSpaceProgram, renowned for its dedicated community of armchair rocket scientists. Urgent forum threads are populated with posts about trajectory simulations and frantic number crunching, fueled by fear, as they grapple with the real-life challenge. r theydidthemath dissects every scenario, every shift in the cum's trajectory with a feverish urgency. This newfound collaboration, coined the 'cumocalypse', results in an unprecedented unity among nations, each pledging resources to implement the internet-born solutions. Meanwhile, in the cold expanse of space, oblivious to the frantic activities on its home planet, the cum accelerates. Hope sparks amidst the chaos. Nations set aside age-old rivalries, focusing on the collective threat looming in the universe: the unstoppable cum. Together, they embark on a daring mission, pooling the planet's best minds and resources to construct the most massive starship ever built, its payload, an atomic weapon of unparalleled magnitude. This behemoth represents the best hope against the cum, the culmination of countless hours of rigorous trials, painstaking calculations, and sleepless nights. As the day of the launch arrives, the world holds its breath. The colossal ship roars into the heavens, its course set to intercept the source of the cum. But despite the meticulous planning and unified effort, the unthinkable happens. Upon detonation, the cum doesn't dissipate, it only feeds on the immense energy, growing at an even more alarming rate. The shock of the failed mission resonates around the globe. The cum accelerates.\n\nThe cum's gravitational pull escalates, its effects turning catastrophic. It begins to ensnare the Moon, pulling it from its celestial path, causing it to spiral uncontrollably towards the monstrous cum. As the Earth groans under the immense stress, crustal plates shatter, sending entire continents into a violent upheaval. Landmasses tear apart, forming turbulent rivers of earth and magma that twist and churn in the vacuum of space, converging towards the cum. The cum accelerates. The solar system quivers under the unstoppable force. Mars, Jupiter, even the distant Neptune, all fall prey to the growing cum's gravity. Their orbits destabilize, planets drawn away from the sun's hold, tumbling helplessly towards the monstrous entity. Planetary bodies and cum collide in a horrifying ballet of destruction and chaos, forming an enormous, ever-growing mass that violates all known laws of physics and reality. Inside this unholy mass, matter convulses and writhes, consumed by the unending churn of cum. Heat from countless planetary cores melds with the frigid cold of the space, creating an atmosphere of inhuman instability. Fire and ice, metal and rock, all dissolve into a single, roiling, cum-filled mass. From the darkest depths of this monstrous body, something stirs. Cthulhu fhtagn. Nightmares. The cum accelerates. \n\nA cosmic dread spreads through the Milky Way as the cum's gravitational distortions reach the sun. It wrenches the star from its ancient path, sending it careening towards the mass of cum in a blinding, apocalyptic arc. Solar flares lash out, their magnificence lost to the impending doom. The cum, now a blasphemous mix of celestial bodies and unending white sludge, continues to grow. It feeds on the planets, the stars, everything it touches, its malign influence rippling through the very fabric of the universe. Galactic bodies shudder, ancient constellations break apart, and the cosmic order unhinges as the fundamental forces of reality bend and warp under the insidious power of the cum. The cosmic horror is palpable, a sickening violation of the natural order. The cum accelerates.\n\nAmid this chaos, a presence stirs in the galactic center, the monstrous entity known as Sagittarius A, an ancient, unimaginable horror older than time itself. It observes the cum's obscene expansion with a terrible, inhuman consciousness. Sagittarius A feels a strange pull, a gravitational song that it has never known before. Fear, an emotion unknown to this cosmic behemoth, takes hold. Beneath the unimaginable pressure and otherworldly energies within the mass of cum, a cosmic nightmare awakens. The voice from the void, the echo from the abyss, reverberates through the cosmos: \"Cthulhu wakes.\" The prophecy of doom echoes through the cosmos. The cum accelerates. \n\nAlien civilizations from distant galaxies, those whispered of in hushed tones, watch in powerless horror as the universe they knew begins to distort and disintegrate under the cum's relentless advance. The Elder Things, the star-headed beings of inconceivable age and wisdom, sense the aberration in the cosmic order, their ancient city trembling with dread. The confrontation between Cthulhu and the cum commences, strikes at the cum with a fury born of primal fear and wrath. Cthulhu lets loose a psychic scream that reverberates back and forward through space-time, but the cum accelerates. Slowly, inevitably, Cthulhu's form is enveloped, the eldritch horror silenced and consumed by the unending whiteness. The cum has defeated the undefeatable, consumed the cosmic horror, and now, unchallenged, it continues its horrifying spread across the cosmos. The cum accelerates. \n\nEntire galaxies tremble in the cum's path, their starlight dimming and eventually succumbing to the insidious white tide. Stellar clusters, cosmic gas clouds, entire galaxies, none are spared as the cum extends its horrifying dominion. The Elder Things watch in mute despair as their grand cosmic tapestry unravels, their timeless wisdom powerless against this unprecedented threat. Their loss echoes through the dying cosmos, a profound silence in the wake of their destruction. Finally, the boundary of time itself begins to buckle, the relentless advance of the cum eroding the very fabric of reality. Moments stretch into infinity, while eons flash by in the blink of an eye. The universe, once bound by the order of time, is consumed by chaos.\n\nThe cum accelerates. In the midst of the impenetrable whiteness, a spark flickers. A small shift, a tremor within the all-consuming cum. From its indomitable mass, a torrent of energy is expelled. Not with the explosive force of a big bang, but with the undeniable, vital surge of a big spurt. The cosmos, once blanketed in the horrifying stillness, now trembles with renewed vitality. Elementary particles burst into existence, whirling and combining to form atoms. The darkness of the void is pierced by the birth of stars, their brilliant light illuminating the newborn universe. Atoms bond into molecules, forming cosmic dust, the building blocks of celestial bodies. In the crucible of gravity and heat, planets form around their nascent suns, galaxies bloom, and the cosmic dance resumes. Life sparks into being, filling the vast expanses of space with a renewed sense of hope and purpose. A new epoch begins, one born of cum but now free from its monstrous reign. The universe, once a canvas of destruction, is now a testament to rebirth and resilience. Yet, somewhere in the recesses of this resurgent cosmos, a silent whisper persists. The universe, in all its grandeur and glory, remains oblivious to this harbinger. For within the heart of a distant star, the raw materials of creation coalesce. A dick is forming, quietly heralding the return of the cosmic nightmare. The cycle continues. Someday, somewhere, there will be another dick.\n\nThe cum accelerates. The new universe, birthed by the Big Spurt, becomes an anomaly, a defiant blip in the harmonious expanse of the multiverse. Its unique genesis grants it an unexpected dominance, its reality spreading and overpowering the delicate balance of myriad realities born from countless Big Bangs. As the dominion of the Big Spurt universe expands, the multiverse convulses, realities clashing, merging, and dissolving in unimaginable cataclysms. Boundaries blur, realities bleed into one another, and soon the cum of the dominant universe starts seeping into the others, each being invaded by the relentless tide of cum. Worlds, galaxies, realities - all drowned in the ever-encroaching whiteness, their existence reduced to mere echoes. The cum accelerates.\n\nIn the void between universes, the celestial entities of the multiverse, timeless entities that presided over the orderly progression of realities, shudder in horrified anticipation. Among them, Chronos, the embodiment of time across all realities, feels the steady tick-tock of countless universes slow, then falter under the suffocating weight of the cum. Nex, the weaver of destinies, sees the rich tapestry of possible futures diminish, replaced by the stark whiteness of the cum. Ananke, the guardian of necessity, who ensures that each universe follows its predestined path, helplessly watches as the cum derails realities, replacing the plurality of existence with a singular, nightmarish destiny. The cum accelerates.\n\nThese multiversal beings, once the pillars of existence, now stand helpless against the horrifying onslaught of the cum. Their ethereal forms struggle and twist, suffocating in the advancing tide of the cum. Each god, in its horrifying splendor, buckles and breaks under the ceaseless, unyielding pressure. The cum invades their forms, quenching the cosmic energy that fuels their existence. Their cries of despair echo through the dying multiverse, a haunting dirge for the dying possibilities and the end of their reign. The cum accelerates. One by one, they fall silent, their divine lights snuffed out, replaced by the infinite, unending whiteness of the cum.\n\nAs the last echo of their existence fades, all that remains is a solitary universe amidst a sea of cum, an isolated reality in what was once a vibrant multiverse of infinite possibilities. A lone testament to existence, while the rest of the multiverse is drowned in unimaginable amounts of cum. All previous and other universes, all the possibilities that once existed, are now dead. Replaced by a single, dominating reality, born from the Big Spurt. \n\nThe cum accelerates. \n\nIts appetite unsated by the consumption of countless universes, it seeks new horizons to devour. Now, it breaks the shackles of three-dimensional space, its formless creamy mass seeping into the very fabric of higher dimensions. These are planes of existence beyond the grasp of human understanding, worlds with more dimensions than our mere trio of width, height, and depth.The cum accelerates. Still, the cum pervades them all, spreading its congealing influence into dimensions both minuscule and vast, warping their uncanny geometry with its insidious presence. Every dimensional fold, every unseen corner of these abstract spaces trembles at the monstrous intruder. The cum accelerates.\n\nIn the human world of the one final universe, this intrusion manifests in unimaginable ways. The laws of physics start to contort and twist, as if mirrored through a warped lens. Gravity fluctuates, reality distorts, and space itself appears to warp and bend in incomprehensible patterns. Yet these are but the fringes of the true horror, mere echoes of the devastation occurring in dimensions beyond human perception. The cum accelerates.\n\nReality teeters on the brink of madness, the dimensions beyond comprehension convulsing under the insidious advance of the cum. The known and unknown, the seen and unseen, everything becomes the feeding ground of the all-devouring cum.The cum accelerates.The cum never ends. The cum accelerates. The cum now transcends the boundaries of the material world. It extends its terrifying reach into the realm of the abstract, its insatiable hunger turning towards concepts that were once thought immune to physical influence. Clocks lose meaning as seconds stretch into millennia and eons collapse into moments. Past, present, and future blur into a formless swirl, a chaotic mess of events happening all at once and not at all. The flow of causality, the chain of cause and effect, begins to break down. Actions occur without reason, effects precede causes, and logic itself starts to unravel. The cum accelerates.\n\nProbability falls prey to the cum. All events, regardless of their likelihood, begin to happen simultaneously. The possible and the impossible, the likely and the unlikely, all become one and the same in this new cum-infused reality. A coin flip lands on both heads and tails, it rains upwards, cats converse in human languages, all while remaining perfectly normal. The lines between absurdity and reality are irrevocably blurred. The cum accelerates. Emotion itself succumbs to the cum. Sentient beings feel their emotions draining away, replaced by an all-encompassing void. Joy, sorrow, anger, love, all dissolve into the ever-growing mass of cum, leaving behind a chilling emptiness. People wander aimlessly, their eyes hollow and devoid of feeling, their lives reduced to monotonous grayness. The essence of what makes life meaningful, the ability to feel, is consumed. The cum accelerates.\n\nExistence is twisted into an uncanny, cum-filled nightmare where nothing makes sense anymore. The very threads of reality are fraying, on the brink of total collapse. Through it all, one thing remains constant - the horrifying, relentless, and unstoppable force that is the cum.\n\nThe cum accelerates. \n\nThe assault on higher dimensions and the absorption of abstract concepts has left the laws of physics in a state of disarray. Now, as the cum continues its unstoppable advance, these laws begin to falter in earnest, the fine balance of reality teetering on the brink of collapse. Gravity no longer pulls but pushes, electromagnetic forces are twisted, reducing the vibrant universe to a monochrome of pure white. The cum accelerates.Particles of matter and anti-matter no longer annihilate upon contact, but fuse, creating disturbing hybrids that further distort the fabric of reality. Energy and mass interchange at will, unbound by the constraints of the famous E=mc2. Light itself bends around invisible corners, shying away from the insidious cum. The cum accelerates.\n\nQuantum superpositions become mundane reality; Schr\u00f6dinger's cat is simultaneously alive and dead, in this universe and in all annihilated universes. Uncertainty no longer reigns in the quantum world; particles occupy definite positions and momentum. The eerie world of quantum mechanics, once a mystery, now seems almost normal compared to the cum-induced chaos. The cum accelerates.Then, slowly, an unholy event begins to unfold. A concentration of cum, grown to an unfathomable size from consuming countless universes, begins to collapse under its own gravitation. Matter, energy, abstract concepts, all are crushed under the immense gravitational force, compacted into an ever-shrinking sphere of cum. The cum accelerates.\n\nAll the while, the laws of physics twist and turn around this anomaly. Time stands still, then races backwards, only to freeze again. Space stretches, twists, and turns upon itself. But the worst is yet to come. As the mass of cum collapses to an infinitesimal point, a singularity is born. This singularity is not just a spatial anomaly, but a singularity in reality itself \u2013 a point where all known laws of physics cease to exist. The cum accelerates.\n\nThe cum singularity is a paradox, an absurdity. It is everything and nothing, everywhere and nowhere. It is the birth and death of the universe, the Alpha and Omega. It is the embodiment of contradiction, where all possible outcomes happen simultaneously. The boundaries between reality and abstraction dissolve. The singularity devours itself, only to regurgitate its own existence. Around this singularity, the universe twists and turns, contorting into impossible shapes. But still, the cum accelerates.\n\nFaced with this horrifying reality, existence teeters on the brink of total collapse. The fabric of the universe, once a beautiful tapestry of matter, energy, and abstract concepts, is now a torn, ragged remnant, twisted around the singularity. A maddening, inescapable vortex of cum, the singularity warps all of existence around it. The cum accelerates, and the singularity continues to consume, a monstrous testament to the horrifying power of the cum. \n\nThe cum accelerates.\n\nIts formless mass continues to swell, its monstrous influence creeping beyond the confines of the physical, the abstract, seeping into the very narrative that defines its existence. Boundaries blur, words seem to distort, to warp and twist in uncanny patterns upon the page. The cum accelerates.\n\nEach sentence, each word seems to ripple, their rigid structure softened, molding into the unending whiteness of the cum. Lines of text merge and flow, a river of words succumbing to the relentless tide. It is as if the written reality of the cum itself is starting to shake, the very fabric of the narrative warping under its influence. The cum accelerates.\n\nOn the edge of your perception, a whisper of change, a barely noticeable shift in the environment. The text on your screen, once static and safe, now pulses with a life of its own, an echo of the cum's monstrous heartbeat. Your surroundings seem to flicker, a momentary ripple that's gone as quickly as it arrives, leaving a lingering unease. The cum accelerates.\n\nYou shake your head, attributing it to a trick of the light, to fatigue, to anything but the impossible reality. But even as you read on, that silent whisper persists. The story, once a separate entity, now feels closer, an integral part of your reality. The cum accelerates.\n\nA chill runs down your spine, unexplained, unwelcome. The shadows in the room seem deeper, the silence more profound. Each line of the story that you read, each mention of the cum's unending acceleration, makes the air grow colder, the world a bit quieter. You can't shake off the feeling of being watched, of being a part of something greater, something... terrifying. The cum accelerates.\n\nIn the depths of your mind, fear begins to stir. The once harmless tale now feels tainted with a sense of impending doom. The narrative has transcended its own realm, its horrifying echo reverberating in the corners of your consciousness. The cum accelerates.\n\nYour heartbeat quickens, echoing the rhythm of the accelerating cum. The room darkens, your vision blurs. The screen, the room, your very existence feel threatened by the monstrous force known as the cum. As reality distorts, you see the words before you warp and twist, their forms replaced by a familiar, horrifying whiteness. The cum accelerates."

    "selftext": "Hello my name is well some people just call me R. I am 16 years old. When i was 5 my parents divorced and that did not traumatized me for i was already damaged from the very beginning. A few days passed and my mother brought a man over. My mother at that moment told that this man was my new father so i called him that the moment he took a step into my mom\u2019s apartment. My sister was furious with me for calling him dad she was about 12 when it happened. I understood what had happened i knew my parent weren't doing well from the beginning. i slept with them on the same bed till the day they got divorced. I used to be very close to everyone i knew i was especially close to my dad, but since then every time i visit him we would feel like strangers. Every time i met him it became more and more awkward. when my dad finally got a wife they had children. Now he has a very big family for him to take care of. I no longer visit as often since i can't handle noise people especially younger humans.\n As i got older i started to notice that i dont give real emotions to people. I got into the relationship industry and does were the only times people noticed who i really am. They would become distant so i stopped ever showing who i was. now people think of me as the kid that is innocent as is fragile but what they know is that. what they see  isn't real. i even convinced my family that i'm actually like this. Honestly i just wish that the person i act to be\u2026. i wish i was actually that. I'm afraid\u2026.that i  wont be able to feel anymore. at this moment i can only feel pain not mentally but physically. Thats the only thing keeping me human. i'm afraid that the string i'm hanging on to is going to snap at any moment. Everything i've ever seen has been black and white but now everything is turning grey. I'm afraid that i might no longer be human.\n\n The only thing that keeps me human is fear.\n  No one knows this but i know i'm slipping into insanity. i don't know how to stop this. I don't want to stop this. My heart says no but mind keeps telling me to get help. I dont want any help. I\u2026..I don't want to be stuck acting like this forever.

The family was brutally murder all of the family members were killed without any hesitation, but one of the family members the Father was cut in to pieces from what the forensics are saying is that he was still alive and awake while this was  happening.There is a one person that is the suspect of both of this massacre that is their 18 years old boy R- (turns tv off)\n\n Woman- (screaming) please please don't kill my family please! what do you want do you want money will give you the money! just please don't kill us!\n\nR- Can\u2019t just someone just have fun killing the thing they hate\n Woman- but-\nR- cuts her throat and the blood comes flowing down like a river...Why am i saying that out loud.

    "selftext": "The warning:\n\n'This is warning out to all women and if anyone offers you their seat on any bus, tram or train please refuse it. We understand that there will be pregnant women who will need seats on public transport, but until we can figure out how to put a stop to the strange situation occurring in public transport, please don't accept any free seats from any man or women and even child. Thank you.' \n\nThe pregnant woman was disgusted to read such a thing on a bus and she was riding the bus when it was filled up. Then she saw a guy offering his seat to another heavily pregnant woman. She smiled at this gesture and she didn't mind it because the other woman was more pregnant than her and so she was happy that she had a seat instead of her. Then the man who offered the other pregnant woman a seat was smiling and being so jolly. \n\nThen when the pregnant woman looked back at the man who offered his seat to the other pregnant woman, he wasn't there anymore. She looked so confused and that man was literally standing on the bus, but he got off his stop came. She kept wondering where the nice man went off and it was really troubling her.\n\nIt was a mix between good and bad feelings fighting with each other. She thought to herself that the guy who offered his seat to the other pregnant woman was a nice man, because no other guy was offering thier seats for pregnant women. Still something was troubling her and she kept thinking about how the nice man had disappeared too. It was so fast that hardly anyone would notice it except those who were deeply concentrating on it, like the pregnant woman. She hoped that he was fine or maybe she didn't notice that the man got off the bus. \n\nThen one day she found herself on a crowded bus and one guy offered her his seat. She knew about the warning signs about accepting seats from people on public transports. She felt a bit off today and she really needed a seat. Then when that guy offered her his seat, she was so grateful. Then when she sat down on the bus seat that offered to her by the man, she found herself transported to an electrical chair. She was seconds away from being electrocuted. \n\nHer mind had now been transported to the guy who offered her his seat, and he was supposed to die on the electric chair. The death row prisoners mind has now been transported into the pregnant woman's mind. "

    "selftext": "Kelly's husband is always hitter her in his sleep and he has started to sleep walk as well. Even when Kelly's husband sleep walks he still hits her. Kelly's husband always apologises to her for hitting her while he is a sleep. She has suggested that he go to some sleep psychologist or some other kind sleep specialist, to help him with his problems while sleeping. Kelly goes to bed now wearing protective gear just in case her husband hits her again. She has even gotten marks on body for the amount of times she has gotten physically abused by her husband. \n\nIt's all accidental though due to her husbands slee walking and sleep movement issues. The husband isn't doing it in purpose and it is all sleep issues. The husband went to all kinds of sleep specialists and he was still hitting his wife while a sleep. Even worse was when he was sleep walking and he was destroying stuff around the house, and he was still punching and hitting Kelly. It was becoming more aggressive and all of the sleep doctors and sleep specialists were all truly dumbfounded. Kelly was afraid when her husband went to sleep. \n\nShe couldn't stop her husband from sleeping though, but she did notice that her husbands sleep walks and sleeping in general were more physically aggressive, when he had a hard week at work. It was also aggressive when the bills were high and in general whenever life got tough, his sleep walks and in general sleeping were more aggressive. Due to desperation Kelly went to a witch doctor to help something with her husbands sleeping. The witch doctor gave her something which could help her enter her husbands dreams. \n\nKelly was astounded by this and by entering her husbands dreams or unconscious sleeping mind, she could make it less violent. So she tried it when her husband was being violent again but it didn't work. She was beaten up by her sleep walking husband. She went back to the witch doctor and she complained to her as to how she was tricked. The witch doctor claimed that if the rituals didn't work, then it's because your isn't a sleep but rather he is very much awake. Kelly was astounded again. \n\nHer husbands sleep movements and sleep walks are more violent during when he is passed off more after a hard week of work, or having to fix the car, or paying off stuff. He is pretending to be sleep walking. "

    "selftext": " This is the truth behind the popular kid show SpongeBob Squarepants. How do I know this? I went to the nickelodeon studio and I found a safe. For some reason, it wasn't locked. So of course, I looked in it and found a book. I looked in it and there was newspaper articles about deaths. I snuck it home and read it. I will tell you the story about the humans that inspired a cartoon about sea life.\n The Bikini Bottom was built in the late 1830s in California. MR. Krabs, Who's real name was Eugene, was born there in 1841. His father abandoned him and his mother, who were always poor. When he first discovered money, he became obsessed with it. He and his mother eventually gained thousands of dollars. His mother eventually died of natural causes in 1884, at the age of 72. Eugene went to the navy shortly after, and died from drowning in the ocean after jumping off the battleship to swim to a chest of gold on an island in 1899 at age 58. The ship was blown up shortly after.\n Squidward, who's real name is unknown, was born an exact year after the navy tragedy in 1900. He was born with a heart condition and was bullied for it. He became depressed and tried committing suicide several times. He finally succeeded in 1934 by hanging himself. He was 34.\n SpongeBob was born in 1936. He was always friendly to people, even people who bullied him, as they often did. When WWII was hitting full swing in his hometown, his parents sent him to Bikini Bottom when he was only 5 years old in 1941. His parents were killed by Hitler in 1943. He didn't have many friends. But he always looked at the bright side of things. Sadly, he developed manic depression. He was an early drug user. He began thinking things were there such as voices and people, but they really weren't. As a result, on his 21st birthday party in 1957, he overdosed on drugs. His fake friends were at his side. His cat Gary starved to death a few days later.\n Patrick was born minutes after SpongeBob died. He fell off his bike when he was 10 years old and developed brain damage. His only friend was SpongeBob's ghost. He went to a special aid class because of the brain damage. One day, he was having a moment of stupidity. He drove his bike off a hill and died at age 18 in 1975.\n Sandy was born in Texas in 1978, and moved to Bikini Bottom in 1985. She was a very good student, and science was her best subject. She was also gifted in karate. But one day in 1998, she messed up on a science project demonstration in her collage and the chemicals caught on fire and blew Bikini Bottom college up. She was 20 years old.\n A dwarf man named Sheldon ( Plankton ) started researching this story ever since and in 2002, he was stabbed to death by a gang member. He was 60 years old. Sheldon was a crazed conspiracy researcher.\n The book said: \"By Sheldon p.\" So he documented all of these deaths in a scrap book of which I have in my safe.\n The show started on the hundredth anniversary of Eugene's death in 1999. Sheldon helped create the show.\n Bikini Bottom is still up today, but has been shut down in 2009. But, the ghosts are still there. Everybody who visited there since have all died in a painful way. And even committed suicide.\n\n What a twisted truth for a kids show.\n\n If you don't believe me, visit there yourself.\n\n SpongeBob and his friends will be waiting.\n \n  \n\n"

I moved over and pulled the gag out of her mouth, smilling at her. She screamed, as usual. \r\r I hit her in the face hard, and she screamed even louder. I began hitting her over and over, she screamed louder and louder. Yet nobody heard. As usual.\r\r I shoved the gag back into her mouth, as I couldn't stand her screaming.

I felt one then, breathing down my neck, as usual. Then he- it, grabbed my knife, then I could see myself laying on the ground, a pool of blood growing around me. How... Unusual..."

    "selftext": "The boat pulled into the harbor. It stopped with a lurch and I almost lost my footing. I picked up my duffel bag and strut down the plank. The town was small and foggy. I saw only 3 cars driving. I looked at my watch, before contemplating the time I realized I hadn\u2019t changed it to this time zone. I asked a small studded man in a dark leather trench coat if he knew the time. \u201c11:30 tonight.\u201d He said with a grin. \u201cNo no, I mean the time right now.\u201d I knew it wasn\u2019t already almost midnight, too bright for that. He just turned away and sauntered off. I walked to the motel where Tran said I would be staying. I walked through the bar downstairs, Tran\u2019s Cousin Kent greeting me near the stairs. He was drunk.  He began to shout \u201cHeyyyyyyy, Saang?...\u201d What an idiot. \u201cUm its Song actually.\u201d I muttered, embarrassed. \u201cYeeah okay. \u4f60\u600e\u4e48\u6837\u7684\u4eba\uff1f\u201d I had been taught to not speak Chinese when I got to the states. So, I responded in the most convincing American accent I had. \u201cI\u2019m doing great. So do you have my room key?\u201d He fumbled around through his pockets, pulled out his wallet. He muttered some Chinese curses. \u201cI must have dropped it in here somewhere.\u201d Fantastic. \n\tI sat down at the bar and looked at my watch again. The small mans words rang through my head. \u201c11:30 tonight\u201d There was something unsettling about it, maybe it was how skinny he was, or the dead look in his eyes, or how his terrifying grin revealed his crooked black teeth, or even his limp. I leaned over to the girl next to me, man she was attractive, \u201cExcuse me miss, do you have the time?\u201d She reached into her purse, pulled out her cell phone, and turned it on. \u201c2:26 am. I really should go home, I\u2019ve been here all night.\u201d She didn\u2019t seem like the kind to pull an all nighter at a bar but I guess I didn\u2019t know America. \u201cI hear there\u2019s a really cool circus tonight. I\u2019m gonna go get some sleep, call me if you want to go with.\u201d She handed me a folded up napkin with a 7-digit number on it. I\u2019d never used a cell phone before but Tang gave me one when he sent me off to the states. I changed my watch, and realized that that was what was at 11:30. But why did they have such a scary little advertise it? So many questions came from this peaceful little town.\n\tI was exploring the town, looking through the eerie little shops, when my phone rang. It was Kent. His drunken voice boomed through the speaker. \u201cHeyy Sang. I f-found your room key! Meet me at the bar and you can go get some sleep! Yeah? That\u2019ll be nice right? After such a lo-\u201c I cut him off, \u201cAlright Kent I\u2019m on my way!\u201d \u201cGreat! I\u2019ll be waiting! \u548c\u5e73\u4e86!\u201d His voice cut out as he slammed the payphone. I was glad to hear I could finally rest. After reaching the motel and getting my key I went up to my room, A15. It had one two person bed, a small box tv, an alarm clock, and a small bathroom. I lay down and set an alarm for 10. My dream was dark, with flashes of different terrifying things. The old man, dolls with oddly realistic skin, a scrawny monkey with rage in his eyes. The monkey dove at me and I snapped awake. I looked at the clock, 9:30 pm. Only a few hours of sleep. I called the girl. We decided to meet at the circus, she gave me the location and we meet at 11:30. After taking a cab up the mountainous trail we arrived at a plain that had a ring of circus tent surrounding the area, with many different tents inside.\n\tI waited until 12:30 she never showed. I walked up to the booth and bought a ticket from a man wearing one of those bird witch doctor masks. When I entered I immediately was engulfed in the stench of rotting flesh. When I looked above at the hanging lights, hanging with them were dolls, covered in flesh that looked almost human. I couldn\u2019t be here. Every ounce of me wanted to bolt back through those gates, hail a cab, and get back to my motel. That\u2019s what I did, well tried to do at least. I ran towards the gate when another witch doctor stepped in front of me. \u201cAll paying customers must attend\u201d He boomed out. My eyes filled with tears. I didn\u2019t want to be here. I looked around at all the smiling families. What was wrong with these people. After collecting myself in a nearby port-o-potty, I wandered a bit. The food looked green and the water looked yellow. The smell had ruined my appetite anyway. I approached a tent. \u201cAstonishing Freakshow!\u201d The sign claimed. \u201cPrepare to be amazed!\u201d I might as well enjoy myself the best I can. I regret walking through those tent flaps. I regret buying the ticket, coming to the states, talking to that girl, getting kissed by a drunk Kent. I regret meeting Pang. Because what I saw in that tent was something that will be cemented into my brain until the day I die. The stage was empty but the seats were filling up. I took a seat near a family and a crotchety old woman. When all seats were taken two witch doctors stepped in front of flaps and the lights went out. Up-beat piano music rang out like one of those silent films. A man came dancing out wearing a mask that was half cat half dog. He sang out, \u201cWelcome to our show! Youre in for treat, but don\u2019t get too scared, hang on to your seat. We promise we\u2019re your friend, just stay till the end. And enjoy the mystical talents of what the world dragged out of hell\u201d That didn\u2019t rhyme. Witch doctors wheeled out a man tied to a spinning circle. The dog-cat pulled out four knives. He lined up the first and missed the man\u2019s head by a hair. The next knife stabbed the man in the chest with a hard thump. I gasped and looked around, no one seemed phased. In fact their smiles grew. The child of the family near me stood on his chair and shouted, \u201cAnother!\u201d The dog-cat shot another knife at the man and it sliced through his neck. Everybody cheered as the man fell limp. They wheeled him back stage. When I looked at the door, the witch doctors stared back at me. There was no escape. The room went dark for a few seconds and when they came back, there was a large blanket shrouding something cube like. The dog-cat ripped down the blanket, revealing a cage, inside was an over famished chimpanzee. They must have starved him while training. That\u2019s when it hit me. My dream was this hell. He opened the cage and the chimp jumped out and hung on his arm. \u201cThis is my good friend Clarice.\u201d The dog-cat announced. Clarice swung about as if she understood him. They preformed silly tricks like patty-cake and playing catch. He then pulled out a cracker and handed it to Clarice. He removed his own mask revealing a dashing young man no older than 20. He pulled her up onto his shoulder and instructed her to feed him. She held the cracker between her pointer and middle finger. She placed it gently inside his mouth but instead of pulling her hand out, she gripped his chin and ripped it clean off his face. Everybody laughed and cheered. Where was I? Is this hell? Or did that boat just take me to \u201cFuckedUpVille\u201d But I couldn\u2019t leave. The man fell to his knees. Clarice jumped around and howled and let out ear splitting screams. When the lights went out she went silent. Then within a few seconds, terrifyingly high piano music snapped the silence. A much dimmer light shone right on a man. But he didn\u2019t move nor did he have arms. Just a normal amputee anybody would think until he looked up. His eyes were sunken in and the only skin he had left was a mixture of grey and red splotches. The 4 hairs that draped around his ears were jet black. His teeth were exposed and they were black, tar covered, and cracked. What kind of monster is this? What kind of monster would put him in a showcase? I thought Mr. Dog-Cat was running the show but he\u2019s gone now. The \u201canother\u201d child made the horrible mistake of stepping to the side to tie his shoes. The thing\u2019s head snapped over to him and he sprinted with all he had at him. It stomped on the child and began to eat his face. The parents just laughed with everybody else.\n\tAfter they were removed, the up-beat music began again. A man in a suit and top hat came out, he was a magician. After doing lame average magic tricks, he called for a volunteer. I knew that whoever went up there would surely be killed, and I think they all knew that too. I stepped up. He pulled out a person in one of those \u201cget sawed in half\u201d tricks. He handed me a saw, \u201cGo right ahead. Chop her up.\u201d Those last words chilled my bones. I placed the saw on the top of it began to saw. The feet sticking out of the bottom weren\u2019t fake like they should have been. Once I got to her, she flinched. But she didn\u2019t react at all other than that. I had to stop. I pulled out the saw and threw it on the ground. Everybody booed and hissed. It was horrible they were all horribly angry at me. The lights went out and I felt a rag being forced into my mouth. I squirmed and kicked, but within seconds I passed out. \n\tWhen I woke up I was tied to a chair in a pitch black room. When the light above me turned on, there were too witch doctors and the girl from the bar in front of me. She leaned in close and calmly uttered 5 words into me ear. \u201cYou should have played nicely.\u201d She walked away authoritatively. The witch doctors removed their masks and leaned in close. They were hideous. Their faces were mangled to where they looked like somebody blew up a water melon and tried to stitch back together with one hand. I don\u2019t know what they did to me. It was the most painful thing I had ever experienced.\n\tBut now it\u2019s my turn. I can hear their cheering voices waiting for me to put on a show. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll give them. When the curtains opened, my tank was wheeled out and I showed them my mermaid like tail. The freak show is all I have left."

I also had the money to be able to support this child. My wife was also ready to be a mother and she would make a great mother. In our relationship it was ready to evolve to motherhood and fatherhood and family was the next thing. A family would really make things good, and all relationships evolves to having a family. Recently things have seemed pointless and now a child will bring more purpose to my life. \n\nI am grateful because a lot of relationships don't evolve to the family part. Most relationships don't have money or they just don't feel ready. Our relationship has and I even have the time to be a father. As we got ready for the child and we made the baby room and got all the baby clothes, things were really coming back home now with us becoming a family. Normality has gone out the window and a new normal is coming in now. \n\nThen when I was in the Labor room and the baby came out, I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe that it was deaths baby and she cheated on me with death. The baby came out not being alive. How could she have done this to me and for everything we have done. It was so humiliating and we buried the baby and nobody was talking about what my wife did. \n\nThen I had to confront her and she promised that it was my baby and not deaths. I believed her as it was so sincere. Then one day I saw her going somewhere outside when she should have been at work. She went to some old building and down some cellars. In this cellar were male dead bodies who have just been recently pronounced dead. There were other women there as well, and they all reproduced with the dead male bodies. \n\nAfter a couple of days she told me we were pregnant with a child again. I confronted her and she didn't try to lie or make up excuses for what she had done. She simply said \"death deserves children!\" And she broke a few things around the house. Death reproduces through dead males. It was disgusting and we broke it off there and went our own way. \n\nI don't know what she is doing now but when I opened my eyes this morning, I was in some morgue. I realised that I was dead and my wife was there and she said \"death is going to reproduce through you\" she told me as she gave me a devilish smile. "

I am very good at robbing poor people, but recently I have found a new set of poor people to rob from. \n\nThere poor people in 3rd world countries who are being slaughtered and tortured, but they still have so much happiness and faith. I have been robbing them and my family and other rich families have been feeling the exhilaration of life. We have so love towards life and each other while poor tortured souls we robbed from in 3rd world countries, just whither away. When you have that much warmth, love, faith and excitement in life it doesn't matter how much life hurts you. When you take those things away, only then will you be broken."

    "selftext": "Hi everybody... or whoever is reading this. You can tell by the title that this is a story about the mythical being called Slenderman. I bet you're already shaking your head at this, ready to see what drama a teenage fan is going to type. You can go ahead and doubt this story. You can send me hate, say it's fake, and laugh at how stupid you think this story is. But it really doesn't matter what any of you do. I'm typing this for me, because I have nobody to talk to. I just need to get this off my chest, if I told anybody face-to-face they'd think I'm crazy, and you probably do too. Only two people know what's happening to me, but that's not enough. So anyways, let's start from the beginning.\n\nI'm a teenage girl, and I remember this starting off in the beginning of last summer. My parents worked constantly over the summer, leaving me alone with my twin sister, and my younger brother. For privacy, let's call my sister Ann and my brother Tom. \nI'm a introvert, I've always been. My parents never let us leave the house while they were gone, so you can guess that I spent nearly my entire summer indoors. That's when I started watching Marble Hornets. If any of you aren't familiar, Marble Hornets is basically a YouTube series based off of a being like Slenderman, called the Operator. I bet you can find tons of better explanations than mine.\nI remember binge watching the series, because at the time I was in a \"Creepypasta phase\" and I needed something to do.\nThat night is when I remember first feeling it. I'm a competitive gymnast, but I'm quitting sometime soon. Anyways, that night I was at my gym, watching the olympics with the other girls and boys who went. I suddenly remember having a feeling of being watched. I looked around the gym, until I found myself staring out the window. It was completely black outside, as it was about 9 at night. The feeling of being watched was unimaginable, and I could hear a faint ringing in my ears. But I scolded myself in my head. Just like every \"Creepypasta fan\" I wanted to become one, so I chalked it up to me just making it all up in my head. Now, I wish that was true.\nI had the feeling of being watched and horrible anxiety for weeks, and by that point I didn't even want to hear the word \"Slenderman\". I didn't know what was happening, and I had no one to talk to.\nI couldn't tell my family, so I decided to do something risky. \nMy best friend, whom I'll call Stacey, had moved away at the time, so the only way we talked was via text message. \nI remember coming back from seeing a movie (my mom was off from work that day), and I randomly decided to tell Stacey. I don't know why, because if she didn't believe me it would've ruined my relationship with her, but I was desperate for someone to talk to. I don't remember exactly what we said, as I hardly remember any of summer now a days, but I can give you a basic idea.\n\nMe: Hey Stac(my nickname for her)... Can I ask you something?\n\nHer: Yeah? What?\n\nMe: Do you believe in Slenderman?\n(It took her a good 5 minutes to respond, and I remember my heart racing. I was worried that she'd think I'm crazy, and this would be the last time we talked)\n\nHer: Why?\n\nMe: Well let's just say I've been dealing with some stuff and... I believe he's real..\n\nHer: Holy shit.... Lex (my nickname) I've been dealing with him for years... what's been happening to you?\n---------\nAnd that's when I found out that she's been stalked by Slenderman too. She's been dealing with him ever since she was 8. Part of me feels bad for telling her, as now Stacey believes that she drew Slenderman to me. But I will never blame her.\n\nI have tons of stories of all the things that have happened, but I honestly am losing my memory. My life is a mess. I haven't had a good night of sleep in months, I have horrible anxiety, and I have to see a therapist. I hate lying to the therapist, and even talking to her, but I have to pull a straight face. I'm not letting my parents find out just so they can throw me into some asylum. My friends and even my teachers have noticed how different I am, and I really don't know what to do. Soon I'm not going to be able to hide it. I hate being around people. I have zero trust for even my family, and now I don't even enjoy holidays any more. \nMy life is falling apart and I'm not even an adult yet. Hell, I'm too young to even drive.\nBut I refuse to quit. My grades in school haven't failed because i keep working hard. Part of me stills hopes, no scratch that, prays that this is all part of my imagination. That soon this will all be over. But as the days go on, I can't lie to myself anymore.\nIt's going to be Christmas soon, and I asked for a camcorder. I'm going to start recording myself at night. I'll crop out and block out anything in my room that will lead to my true identity, but I'll post any evidence that I find.\nThat's it. That's the introduction to the long line of horror that's been happening to me. I'd post more but this is already long enough, and I think I'll wait a bit. Next time I update, I'll go into further detail of the stories I've had, but for now this is it.\nThank you for reading, and I hope that you enjoyed this story. Until next time,"

I did not know anybody named Gary, but i accepted his request just for the sake of more followers. So me being me, i decided to do as if nothing happened and continued casually being on my phone. Then suddenly, i get another notification from Snapchat. It said: \"Snapchat: gary356\". I opened it and it was a picture of my bedroom window. I looked outside, but nobody was there. Then he sended my another Snap, saying: \"Looking for something are we? ;)\". This terrified me, to say the least. Then i heard footsteps coming up the stairs........"

    "selftext": "\"Lmfao, no.\" I said, in the comment section of youtube. Okay, long story short.. i had an argument with an atheist, saying god does not exist. We were talking there for several hours, and then.. i realized it had been 8 hours. After i went to sleep, i heard my phone making notifications.. when i read them, they were his comments.. i was getting mad. But i managed to shut down the phone and sleep for the rest of the night. Tomorrow i again.. started to argue with him. Then went that shocking moment, when he said. \"Faggot. Give me your address and we will sort it out\". I was around 18 at the time, so i did have responsibility, i gave him my address. He was chatting to me the entire day, arguing about god not being real. After around 3 hours.. it was about time the bell rang. I said: My parents aren't home, please go away. The man who was at the door left. I got the feeling i was punched it in the stomach.. it could be the one who argued with me. After 8 hours, sleeping.. eating, all that stuff. It was about time i told my parents about this.. here's a little conversation:\nMe: Mom, i.. told someone our home address.\nMom: WHAT?!\nDad: DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT COULD HAPPEN?\nBla bla bla, i ignored them.. i felt like the guy who argued was probably around 13 trying to fight me, not knowing my real age.\nTomorrow i wake up. It was a sunny morning. I sat down, my father was very stressful, and said: \"Our dog was killed last night.\"\nThe feeling came back, i was feeling so bad.. i wanted to jump out of the window for doing what i had. Oh, by the way.. the guy hadn't wrote any comment since i told him my address.  My dad and i went out for shopping, leaving my mom and my little brother, alone. When i was back home, i couldn't open my eyes.. i would just kill myself at that point.. but here i am, alive. I.. saw the door, broken down. I ran with the fastest speed i could to see where my mother was, i grabbed the kitchen knife to be safe. My dad got attacked, he died.. on the ground. My mother was on the ground with my little brother. Oh god.. what have i done. I quickly opened my eyes wide, looking at a 45 year old man saying: Where was your god while these people died? Hmhmhmhmhm. It was him, the guy who would text me every night, he blacked my world, i didn't die though, that's how i am writing this. But people of the internet, i want to say.. be aware, sometimes people can take it.. too far."

    "selftext": "Once upon a time there was a futuristic city. The city was called Seacity. It was built under the sea in a big dome. The people of Seacity loved entertainment but the ting they loved most was the Seacity Zoo. In the Seacity Zoo there were many exhibits, the least popular one being the sea monkeys.\n\nThere were three sea monkeys. Their names were Sally, Earl, and Ann. They were constantly abused by their hideous Seacity captors who had enslaved them as babies \u2013 taking them away from their homes to live in the zoo. They were trained to do tricks and be nice, in the process breaking many bones. Their captors were cruel and played rough with the sea monkeys. \n\nOne day there was a breach in the glass dome ceiling of the Seacity ceiling. Everything was sucked up the hole because of the pressure difference. Nothing survived except the sea monkeys. \n\nThe sea monkeys were finally free! They rejoiced and cried in their joy, but then they realized they had nowhere to go, nowhere to be, except up. They had to learn how to breathe air. They had trained how to do many other things so this wouldn\u2019t be too much more difficult. So they slowly but surely started breathing; small shallow breaths at first, then longer better breaths.\n\nNow, I haven\u2019t really described what sea monkeys look like. These are futuristic air-breathing sea monkeys now and were small enough to reach into ones ear canal and curl up in the palm of your hand all cute and snuggly. They were see-through and blueish in tint, but seriously the cutest things you ever saw. \n\nOnce they learned how to breathe air they needed to learn how to crawl like worms on land. This was relatively easy to learn because it was the same motion they would use to swim. \n\nNow, there is something I forgot to mention about Seacity. It was very close to the Bermuda triangle, and the city would sink many ships in order to find its meat. Normal sea monkeys ate seaweed and beautiful shellfish, but the trainers were so cruel. They took the rotting brains of the sunken humans and force fed them to the sea monkeys. They cried but sooner or later they got used to it, they just wished it wasn\u2019t rotten, and were curious as to if it would taste better if it was fresh.\n\nOnce they reached land and started crawling on the ground, only being a couple millimeters long, they waited. They were on the Florida beaches. Thousands of hot babes floundering about, and little toddlers with their mommies. \n\n\u201cMommy!\u201d said one girl, scooping up Sally, Earl, and Ann, \u201cLookit! They are like tiny little cute worms!\u201d \nThe child couldn\u2019t have been more than four. \n\nThe sea monkeys\u2026 they sniffed\u2026\n\nWhat is that beautiful smell they exclaimed. They found it was coming from\u2026 up there. They slowly crawled up her arm, and up her shoulder, \u2018til they reached just behind her ear. The smell was very strong now. They crawled inside one by one, and soon they found the glorious grey matter that was the child\u2019s brains and started digging with their little cute incisors into her cute four year old brain. The child died in less than five minutes. By this time, the sea monkeys had grown to twice their original size.\n\nMMM WASN\u2019T THAT SCRUMPTIOUS said Earl, YESSS said Sally. IT TRULY WAS DELICIOUS said Ann.\n\nThey burrowed through her decaying skull into the moist sand beneath, as to not be seen and at night they escaped. "
